### A2 Readiness

#### No impact to readiness

**George 99** (James L. George, former congressional professional staff
member for national security affairs, "Is Military Readiness Overrated?"
CATO, 5-27-1999,
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/is-military-readiness-overrated)

Military readiness promises to be a major issue when Congress marks up a
defense bill later this year. Some members of Congress are already using
readiness as a reason to increase funding in the emergency spending bill
for the war in Yugoslavia. Most experts cite the initial stages of the
Korean War and the Hollow Force of the late 1970s as cautionary examples
of being ill-prepared. A closer look at both those examples, however,
shows that they really had little to do with readiness. Moreover, the
current crisis in Yugoslavia illustrates once again why [readiness may
be **overrated**]{.underline} and the funds better spent elsewhere.
Although [often **used as a generic term** for all military
capabilities]{.underline}, readiness---defined as the ability to respond
with appropriate force with little or no warning---is only one of four
pillars of military preparedness. The other pillars are force structure,
modernization and sustainability. Thus, [an effective military force
depends on much more than just readiness]{.underline}. Interestingly,
[the two favorite examples cited by readiness alarmists **fail to prove
their case**]{.underline}. The performance of [Task Force
Smith]{.underline}, an ill-prepared battalion quickly sent to the front
and fairly [easily routed by the North Koreans]{.underline} during the
initial days of the Korean War, is often cited as the worst case. "No
More Task Force Smiths" has become a mantra for the Army. However,
critics of Task Force Smith fail to point out that U.S. commanders made
the most basic of military mistakes---including grossly underestimating
the enemy and sending TFS to an exposed position. When such blunders
occur, the end result will be the same whether it is an ill-trained Task
Force Smith in Korea or well-trained Marines in Beirut or elite Rangers
in Somalia. [Moreover, critics also fail to mention that barely a month
later the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [stabilized the
situation in South Korea]{.underline}, and in another month the Marines
conducted their famous Inchon Landing. In fact, without the Chinese
intervention, the United States would have won the Korean War a few
months after it began. Not bad for a U.S. force that was supposedly
ill-prepared. [Similarly, the Hollow Force of the late 1970s was not
primarily a readiness problem but a combination of many
factors---including]{.underline} a military characterized by low morale
after Vietnam, [serious drug and racial problems, the erroneous
induction of too many mentally substandard recruits and low pay eroded
further by high inflation]{.underline}. At the same time, [major
structural changes]{.underline} were transforming the U.S. military,
including the introduction of women into the regular forces, [the switch
from a draft to an all-volunteer force and the initiation of the Total
Force Concept that placed more reliance on the Reserves]{.underline}.
Given all of that turbulence, no wonder we had a Hollow Force. [**Often
overlooked**, however, is **how quickly those problems were
solved**]{.underline}. In some cases, solutions were found without
spending a dime. For example, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Thomas
Hayward instituted his "Not in my Navy" program of zero tolerance for
drugs. The drug problem was solved almost overnight. The induction of
too many mentally substandard recruits by mistake which had lowered
standards, was identified and corrected. That correction solved most
other personnel problems (and should be a warning to people who want to
lower standards today). Some members of Congress are now using the
crisis in Yugoslavia to get more funds for readiness by arguing that the
military is now stretched "too thin." (Congress doubled President
Clinton's request for \$6 billion in emergency spending for the war.) In
fact, the situation is quite the opposite. [Leaving aside the question
of whether the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should even be
involved]{.underline} in Yugoslavia, the new Clinton Doctrine, which
does not plan to use ground troops ( a position that is supported by
many Republicans), limits the stress placed on the military. Those
[decisions are all deliberate political actions that **have absolutely
nothing to do with readiness**]{.underline}. [Under a well-conceived
strategy, even a modestly capable force will probably perform well; but
under a **poorly conceived strategy**, even a force with the highest
degree of readiness will probably have serious problems]{.underline}.
The experiences of Task Force Smith and the Hollow Force, as well as the
invocation of a Clinton Doctrine that eschews the use of ground forces,
have major implications. More forces, for example, could be placed in
the reserves and scarce funds spent elsewhere. In addition, the military
could switch to what Sen. John McCain (R- Ariz.) has called "Tiered
Readiness:" a few forces would be kept on expensive ready status and be
augmented by reserve forces that could be mobilized if a substantial
threat to U.S. security arose. Military readiness is certainly
important, and no one is suggesting a return to the truly shallow force
of the late 1940s or the Hollow Force of the 1970s. But a close look at
those forces shows that their difficulties involved much more than just
poor readiness.

#### The welfare state is key to sustaining the American military

**Mittelstadt 18** (2018, Jennifer, Jennifer Mittelstadt is a Professor
of History at Rutgers University and is the Harold K. Johnson Chair in
Military History at the US Army War College; her work about the
relationship between the welfare state and the military has been
published by the Harvard University Press, "FOR AMERICA, WELFARE IS
ESSENTIAL FOR WARFARE", War On The Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/05/for-america-welfare-is-essential-for-warfare/)>

In 2015 I published a book called [The Rise of the Military Welfare
State](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674286139) that
chronicled the history of military benefits and social services in the
all-volunteer force. For many in the military, the title constituted
fighting words. I didn't anticipate this when I chose it. Some
commenters asked if I thought soldiers were "welfare queens." Others
assumed I was out to cut their benefits. More than a few were angry
enough to wish violence on me. If I had a quarter for every incensed
email and suspicious question I've received, I'd have pocketed far more
money than book sales have generated. The title aroused hostility in
part due to the widely held belief that the military is separate from
civilian life and especially the civilian welfare state. While
**[military personnel partake of subsidized housing, health care, child
care, and many more systems of valuable support]{.underline}**, most
Americans -- and military personnel -- consider those programs "not
social welfare," but a taken-for-granted entitlement in return for the
perceived sacrifices of military life. The differentiation between
military benefits and welfare goes even further than drawing bright
lines between similar programs in different settings. The distinction
shapes fundamental choices of where the nation invests in national
power. The military and welfare are depicted as opposite poles in a
Manichean battle of the budget. Too many political leaders and policy
makers set up a zero-sum game scenario in which they pit ["military
spending" against "welfare
spending"](https://www.ohio.com/akron/editorial/commentary/robert-j-samuelson-the-case-for-increasing-defense-spending),
claiming the former is more important than the latter. Others assume
that social welfare for civilians creates a weak, dependent society that
diminishes national power. The nation must therefore provide funds for
worthy "troops" and take them from unworthy "welfare recipients." For
some elected officials, every breath supporting men and women in uniform
is matched by a [blast to social welfare
spending](http://www.insidesources.com/paul-ryans-exit-spells-trouble-u-s-economy/).
These views reflect distorted understandings of social welfare and
defense, and, as I've learned in spending the past year at the [U.S.
Army War College](https://ssl.armywarcollege.edu/), they're harmful to
American national and military power. [My conversations with senior
leaders have made plain the central role of social welfare in creating
the conditions for both military power and national power. The military
and welfare are not opposites, **they're intertwined**.]{.underline}
Welfare is short-hand for "social welfare," which itself derives from
"the general welfare" of the populace enshrined alongside "the common
defense" in the United States Constitution. While Americans in recent
decades have used the word "welfare" pejoratively to signify
means-tested programs for the poor, historically welfare had a positive
connotation and broader definition. The majority of Americans of the
1950s, including the war hero and [Republican President Dwight D.
Eisenhower](https://millercenter.org/president/eisenhower/domestic-affairs),
for example, approved overwhelmingly of "welfare" and "the welfare
state." Health, education, old age pensions, disability protections,
workplace safety, minimum wages and maximum hours -- all these were
properly considered "welfare." [Even the tax system and subsidized home
loans constitute social welfare in the
US.](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/6220.html) Some Americans
receive social welfare through the government, some through private
charities. Most partake of both even when they don't know it; since the
1930s the government has [subsidized the supposedly "private" employer
benefits](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7551.html) through tax
breaks to large companies, all in an effort to deliver as many social
and economic supports to as many Americans as possible. These [many
types of social welfare have built and continue to sustain military
power. Take the military's most basic requirement -- fielding a force.
The modern U.S. military has never been able to mobilize for war without
adequate welfare for its populace. It was precisely the poor health,
nutrition and education of many potential draftees during both [**World
War I and World War II** that **helped make the case for expanding
national social welfare
programs**](http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-01995-6.html).
Military and Selective Service officials as well as veterans
organizations made the case for social welfare programs for military
preparedness. [During the Cold War decades, the United States filled out
its welfare
state](https://www.amazon.com/Eisenhower-Republicanism-Pursuing-Middle-Way/dp/0875803628),
improving public education, creating food and nutrition programs, and
[fostering physical fitness programs to build "readiness" among youth
eligible for the draft](http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15804.html).
And since the era of the all-volunteer force began in 1973, **social
welfare has become even more essential**. Healthy, able, educated and
sound recruits are the **sine qua non** of the all-volunteer force, and
declines in public health and welfare harm the force]{.underline}.
Today, standards for military service preclude nearly [70 percent of the
youth
population](http://time.com/2938158/youth-fail-to-qualify-military-service/)
who cannot qualify for service -- they are too sick, too physically
unfit, or too undereducated. It has not been possible -- and **[it will
not be possible -- to fill the ranks to acceptable standards without
[basic investments in social
welfare](https://www.strongnation.org/missionreadiness)]{.underline}**.
If [the military needs strong social welfare programs to]{.underline}
fill the force, it also needs them to [utilize the force.]{.underline}
Military benefits and social services -- what I call [the military
welfare
state](https://aeon.co/essays/how-the-us-military-became-a-welfare-state)
-- have grown hand-in-hand with the volunteer force in order [to support
readiness in garrison and
deploymen](https://www.army.mil/article/168539/milley_soldier_readiness_starts_at_home_on_top_quality_army_installations)t[.
Since the 1970s, the military has expanded social and economic benefits
and services to all ranks and created vast new programs such as child
care and family support services. [Dozens of social welfare
programs](https://www.military.com/join-armed-forces/military-benefits-overview.html)
allow military personnel to do the jobs they joined to do, and to do
them well. Even with the wrap-around services the military provides,
military personnel also continue to rely on the civilian welfare state
to fill gaps. Military personnel and their families utilize public
schools, child welfare services, and [food
stamps](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2018/02/14/how-presidents-food-stamp-cuts-would-impact-military-families.html),]{.underline}
to name but a few civilian social welfare programs. The military has not
been able to fulfill its missions -- and will not in the future --
without military and civilian investments in social welfare. [Social
welfare also contributes to the national power of the United
States.]{.underline} Regardless of what one thinks about role of America
in the world today, there is no doubt that [one of the main sources of
its influence has been a healthy, educated, and productive
populace]{.underline}. Critics of welfare argue that the populace would
be better off with a much-diminished welfare state replaced by private
charities, de-regulation, and self-reliance. Indeed, they believe
government welfare programs [diminish the economic productivity and
personal initiative of
Americans](http://thefederalist.com/2015/04/27/dependency-work-incentives-and-the-growing-welfare-state/).
Such a view does not correspond with the historical data on the rise of
the United States to the status of a global power and later a
superpower, however. As historians have documented, the increasing
economic and military might of the United States -- and thus its global
influence -- resulted not from a wildly unregulated free market, but
from the better-regulated, well-distributed capitalism of the
[Progressive and New Deal
state](https://www.amazon.com/America-Great-War-Welfare-State/dp/0195049047),
which, along with the [World War II
regulation](https://www.amazon.com/Warfare-State-World-Americans-Government/dp/019993035X)
and postwar expansions of social welfare like the GI Bill, helped
produce the [healthiest, best-educated generation in U.S. (and world)
history](https://books.google.com/books?id=tS47FVPKATcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+richest+generation&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY4eXK3-LaAhUBh-AKHYRtAfAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=the%20richest%20generation&f=false).
Indeed, one way the United States exerted its global power was through
[exporting its New Deal capitalism
abroad](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674025363). For
their part, my students at **[the U.S. Army War College seemed
intuitively aware of positive relationships between social welfare and
national power.]{.underline}** In my "Theory of War and Strategy"
course, officers adhered to a broad definition of national power. Among
other attributes, they cited key outcomes of social welfare -- a
productive economy, civic vitality, and social equality and opportunity.
Students expressed modesty about the ability to achieve goals through
military force alone and insisted on the inter-connected importance of
political, economic, and social institutions to address matters of
international concern. When we studied the history of the Peloponnesian
War, my students expressed doubts about the long-term viability of the
highly unequal Spartan society that directed all its national resources
to war. And they identified tragedy in the imperial over-reach of
Athens, a city-state whose relative equality and social and cultural
investments ought to have sustained its flourishing role in the larger
Greek world. Similarly, [during an exercise ranking the power of the
world's states, military power never functioned as their sole criterion.
**Education, human development, and resultant economic power topped
their lists.**]{.underline} It's no coincidence that **[eight of the ten
most powerful nations they listed feature [significant social safety
nets](http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SAFETYNETSANDTRANSFERS/Resources/281945-1124119303499/SSNPrimerNote25.pdf)]{.underline}**,
as defined by the World Bank. In large, complex 21^st^ century
societies, **[organized social welfare programs contribute to national
power]{.underline}**. Maligning welfare and genuflecting to the military
are staples of today's partisan politics, where politicians stoke the
worst fears and deepest passions of their electoral bases. But for those
who claim to support U.S. national power and military readiness there is
little excuse for reductionist thinking about social welfare programs.
Yes, meaningful discussion must take place about how to make sure
investments in both social welfare and military spending are ethical and
sustainable. But no serious reckoning of national security can falsely
decouple the two. [Pitting military spending against social
welfare]{.underline} might be popular for [some versions of
politics](https://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2018/01/look-congress-2018-agenda-budgets-social-programs-and-maybe-infrastructure;%20http://www.dailyindependent.com/news/get-ready-for-a-congressional-budget-blowout/article_dc207bba-ffb1-11e7-89be-bf5848d5)

wrong.]{.underline}**

### A2 Econ

#### Economic decline doesn't cause war -- stats prove

**Clary 15** Christopher Clary, Ph.D. in Political Science from MIT,
Postdoctoral Fellow, Watson Institute for International Studies, Brown
University, "Economic Stress and International Cooperation: Evidence
from International Rivalries," April 22, 2015,
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2597712

[Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary
conflict?]{.underline} Or might downturns encourage austerity and
economizing behavior in foreign policy? [This paper provides new
evidence that economic stress is associated with **conciliatory policies
between strategic rivals.**]{.underline} For states that view each other
as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral
cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to
manage the competition. [Drawing on data from **109 distinct rival
dyads** since 1950, **67 of which terminated,** the evidence suggests
rivalries were approximately **twice as likely to terminate during
economic downturns**]{.underline} than they were during periods of
economic normalcy. [This is true controlling for **all of the main
alternative explanations for peaceful relations between
foes**]{.underline} (democratic status, nuclear weapons possession,
capability imbalance, common enemies, and international **[systemic
changes),]{.underline}** [as well as **many** **other** possible
**confounding variables**. This]{.underline} research **[questions
existing theories]{.underline}** [claiming]{.underline} that [economic
downturns are associated with **diversionary war**, and instead
argues]{.underline} that in certain circumstances **[peace may result
from economic troubles]{.underline}**.

#### No econ impact 

**Walt 20** \[Stephen M. Walt is the Robert and Renée Belfer professor
of international relations at Harvard University. "Will a Global
Depression Trigger Another World War?", May 13^th^,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/\]

On balance, however, [I do not think that **even the extraordinary
economic conditions we are witnessing today are going to have much
impact on the likelihood of war.**]{.underline} Why? First of all, [if
depressions were a powerful cause of war, **there would be a lot more**
of the latter.]{.underline} To take one example, [**the United States
has suffered 40 or more recessions** since the country was founded, yet
it has fought perhaps 20 interstate wars, most of them **unrelated** to
the state of the economy]{.underline}. To paraphrase the economist Paul
Samuelson's famous quip about the stock market, [if recessions were a
powerful cause of war, **they would have predicted "nine out of the last
five**]{.underline} (or fewer)."

Second, [states do not start wars unless they believe they will **win a
quick and relatively cheap victory**]{.underline}. As John Mearsheimer
showed in his classic book Conventional Deterrence, [national leaders
avoid war when they are convinced it will be long, bloody, costly, and
uncertain. To choose war, political leaders have to convince themselves
they can either win a quick, cheap, and decisive victory or achieve some
limited objective at low cost]{.underline}. Europe went to war in 1914
with each side believing it would win a rapid and easy victory, and Nazi
Germany developed the strategy of blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes
as quickly and cheaply as possible. Iraq attacked Iran in 1980 because
Saddam believed the Islamic Republic was in disarray and would be easy
to defeat, and George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 convinced the war
would be short, successful, and pay for itself.

The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter
the main point: [**No matter what a country's economic condition might
be**, its leaders will not go to war unless they think they can do so
quickly, cheaply, and with a reasonable probability of
success]{.underline}.

Third, and most important, [the **primary motivation for most wars is
the desire for security, not economic gain.**]{.underline} For this
reason, [the odds of war increase when states believe the long-term
balance of power may be shifting against them, when they are convinced
that adversaries are unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and
when they are confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and
establish a secure position if they act now]{.underline}. The historian
A.J.P. Taylor once observed that "every war between Great Powers
\[between 1848 and 1918\] ... started as a preventive war, not as a war
of conquest," and that remains true of most wars fought since then.

[The bottom line: Economic conditions]{.underline} (i.e., a depression)
[may affect the broader political environment in which decisions for war
or peace are made, but **they are only one factor among many and rarely
the most significant**]{.underline}. [Even if the COVID-19 pandemic has
large, lasting, and negative effects on the world economy---as seems
quite likely---it is **not likely to affect the probability of war very
much,**]{.underline} especially in the short term.

#### Republican victory isn't good for the economy -- they'll pursue the same flawed spending and tax policies

**Mitchell 17** Daniel J. Mitchell was a senior fellow at the Cato
Institute who specialized in fiscal policy, particularly tax reform,
international tax competition, and the economic burden of government
spending. Prior to joining Cato, Mitchell was a senior fellow with the
Heritage Foundation, and an economist for Senator Bob Packwood and the
Senate Finance Committee. His work has been published in numerous
outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Villanova
Law Review, Public Choice, Emory Law Journal, Forbes, USA Today,
Offshore Investment, Playboy, and Investor's Business Daily. He has
appeared on all the major TV networks, and has given speeches in almost
40 states and more than 30 countries. Mitchell earned a PhD in economics
from George Mason University. "Republicans Embrace Bad Economics and Bad
Policy,' August 15, 2017,
https://www.cato.org/blog/republicans-embrace-bad-economics-bad-policy

To be blunt, [Republicans are heading in the wrong direction on fiscal
policy.]{.underline} They have full control of the executive and
legislative branches, but instead of using their power to promote
Reaganomics, it looks like we're getting a reincarnation of the
big‐​government Bush years. As Yogi Berra might have said, "it's déjà vu
all over again." Let's look at the evidence. According to The Hill, the
Keynesian virus has infected GOP thinking on tax cuts. [Republicans are
debating whether parts of their tax‐​reform package should be retroactive
in order to boost the economy by quickly putting more money in people's
wallets. **That is nonsense**.]{.underline} Just as giving people a
check and calling it "stimulus" didn't help the economy under Obama,
giving people a check and calling it a tax cut won't help the economy
under Trump. [Tax cuts boost growth when they reduce the marginal tax
rate on productive behavior such as work, saving, investment, or
entrepreneurship. When that happens, people have an incentive to
generate more income. And that leads to more national income, a.k.a.,
economic growth. Borrowing money from the economy's left pocket and then
stuffing check]{.underline}s (oops, I mean retroactive tax cuts) [in the
economy's right pocket, by contrast, **simply reallocates national
income**]{.underline}. Indeed, this is one of the reasons why [the
economy didn't get much benefit from the 2001 Bush tax cut]{.underline},
especially when compared to the growth‐​oriented 2003 tax cut.
Unfortunately, Republicans haven't learned that lesson. Republicans have
taken steps in the past to ensure that taxpayers directly felt the
benefits of tax cuts. As part of the 2001 tax cuts enacted by President
George W. Bush, taxpayers received rebate checks. The article does
include some analysis from people who understand that retroactive tax
cuts aren't economically beneficial. ...there are also drawbacks to
making tax changes retroactive. ...such changes would add to the cost of
the bill, but would not be an effective way to encourage new spending
and investments. "It has all of the costs of the tax cuts but none of
the economic benefits," said Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget
President Maya MacGuineas, who added that "you don't make investments in
the rear‐​view mirror." I'm not always on the same side as Maya, but
she's right on this issue. [You can't encourage people to generate more
income in the past. If you want more growth, you have to reduce marginal
tax rates on future activity.]{.underline} By the way, I'm not arguing
that there is no political benefit to retroactive tax cuts. If
Republicans simply stated that they were going to send rebate checks to
curry favor with voters, I'd roll my eyes and shrug my shoulders. But
when they make Keynesian arguments to justify such a policy, I can't
help but get upset about the economic illiteracy. Speaking of bad
economic policy, [GOPers also are pursuing bad spending
policy.]{.underline} Politico has a report on a potential budget deal
where everyone wins...except taxpayers. The White House is pushing a
deal on Capitol Hill to head off a government shutdown that would lift
strict spending caps long opposed by Democrats in exchange for money for
President Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico, multiple sources said.
So much for Trump's promise to get tough on the budget, even if it meant
a shutdown. Instead, the back‐​room negotiations are leading to more
spending for all interest groups. Marc Short, the White House's director
of legislative affairs, ...also lobbied for a big budget increase for
the Pentagon, another priority for Trump. ...[The White House is
offering Democrats more funding for their own pet projects.]{.underline}
The only good news is that Democrats are so upset about the symbolism of
the fence that they may not go for the deal. Democrats show no sign of
yielding on the issue. They have already blocked the project once.
Unfortunately, I expect this is just posturing. [When the dust settles,
I expect the desire for more spending (from both parties) will produce a
deal that is bad news. At least for those of us who don't want America
to become Greece (any faster than already scheduled).]{.underline}
Republican and Democratic congressional aides have predicted for months
that both sides will come together on a spending agreement to raise
spending caps for the Pentagon as well as for nondefense domestic
programs. So let's check our scorecard. On the tax side of the equation,
we'll hopefully still get some good policy, such as a lower corporate
tax rate, but it probably will be accompanied by some gimmicky Keynesian
policy. On the spending side of the equation, it appears my fears about
Trump may have been correct and he's going to be a typical
big‐​government Republican. It's possible, of course, that I'm being
needlessly pessimistic and we'll get the kinds of policies I fantasized
about in early 2016. But I wouldn't bet money on a positive outcome.

[Biden.]{.underline} And they're divided over how to handle their
potential big wins. With Biden and Democrats floundering right now, the
GOP is increasingly favored to vault back to partial power in Washington
by flipping the House, and potentially also the Senate, in the coming
midterms. What comes next isn't quite clear: Some Republicans are
mulling ways to collaborate with Biden on issues like trade, energy or
tech; others are prepared to go scorched-earth as their party eyes the
bigger prize of retaking the White House in 2024. [The]{.underline}
GOP's [pro-bipartisanship camp may not have a lot of space in 2023 to
work with the president: funding the government and raising the debt
ceiling will be a major challenge,]{.underline} given how often House
and Senate Republicans diverge on critical pieces of legislation. And
former President Donald Trump will continue trying to influence the
party's direction, criticizing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell and
anyone else who steps out of line with his combative politics. Given
those dynamics, there's no unified GOP agenda for voters to examine this
fall --- other than an up-or-down vote on Biden and congressional
Democrats' record. Republicans aren't sure what will happen next if they
actually win. "It's really going to be a referendum on him and his
administration and on the Democrat leadership in the Congress," John
Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican who is also running for reelection
this fall, said of Biden. "So we need to stay out of our own way." "It's
really important for us to highlight our differences, how we would do it
differently," the South Dakotan added. "And then ... have some things
that we would do or could do if there was a willingness to work
together." House GOP plots to keep advantage for 2022 midterms For now
it's Democrats, holding shaky but singular power in Washington,
consuming the Capitol's oxygen as they struggle to enact Biden's agenda.
But the GOP's splits over whether to work with Biden, even now from the
minority, would become the nation's central political story if it
retakes part or all of Congress this fall. With that victory would come
the messy job of actually governing, preventing credit defaults and
government shutdowns at a minimum. And just as a trio of conservative
senators once battled former President Barack Obama on all fronts as
they sought the White House, there's a stable of Senate and House
Republicans with national political ambitions that could cut against any
attempts to collaborate with Biden. Not to mention the passel of
[Republicans]{.underline} disinterested in the presidency [who are
already signaling they'll push to block Biden at every turn. "**Putting
a stop to his agenda is the first thing that we would do**, because
that's presumably what people would be voting for," said
Sen.]{.underline} Josh [Hawley]{.underline} (R-Mo.), a potential 2024
GOP White House hopeful who led the objections to Biden's election
certification. "[The message would be: If we're in the majority, we need
to stop what he's currently doing."]{.underline} Still, the most
powerful Senate Republican has indicated an openness to work with Biden.
Already feeling bullish on his party's chances this fall, McConnell said
in a late-September interview: "I don't think people send us here to do
nothing." "When you have a closely divided government, or a divided
government," McConnell added then in previously unreported comments, "I
think the American people are saying, 'We know you have some big
differences, and either of you may not be able to move the ball the way
you'd like to. But why don't you look for things you agree on, and do
those?'" McConnell pointed to trade as a potential area of future
cooperation with Biden. As Senate majority leader during the last two
years of Obama's administration, McConnell famously blocked the
president from filling a Supreme Court vacancy and slowed other judicial
confirmations to a trickle. McConnell won't say how he'd handle a
Supreme Court vacancy if one comes up in 2023 or 2024 and he controls
the Senate, though Democrats are positive he wouldn't fill one for Biden
either. Yet McConnell also cut a deal with Obama to fast-track new trade
deals that then-Democratic leader Harry Reid did not lend a hand with.
McConnell later clinched a bipartisan transportation deal with Obama and
Democrats. As minority leader during this Congress, McConnell signed off
on a huge Biden-backed infrastructure bill and after repeated threats
that he would do otherwise, allowed the debt ceiling to increase. House
Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and House Republicans opposed those
accommodations by the Kentucky Republican --- as did Trump. And unlike
McConnell, McCarthy and his conference are in the thrall of the party's
former president. That means [the House Freedom Caucus and other allies
of the former president will be trying to maximize Democrats' losses
even at the expense of legislation some rank-and-file Republicans would
otherwise support]{.underline}, particularly in the Senate. When asked
about areas House Republicans could team up on with the Biden
administration, Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson, a member of GOP leadership,
replied tersely: "On anything that's not socialist." That public
posturing reflects a real concern among some Republicans that Biden
might not be willing to pivot from his current agenda of expanding
social and climate programs, and gutting the filibuster to pass
elections reform, in order to work with Republicans on what would
probably be small-bore issues. With a bipartisan infrastructure package
already law, there's fewer obvious opportunities for collaboration with
the other party at the moment. Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah) suggested
immigration as an avenue for partnership. House Minority Whip Steve
Scalise (R-La.) wants to work with Biden on battling inflation. Sen.
Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said Republicans could talk to Biden about
making Social Security "more sustainable." But **[it's hard to imagine a
split government delivering on even one]{.underline}** of those
[big-ticket **item**]{.underline}s. And some [Republicans are already
downplaying any ideological intersection with Biden after the past year.
"Are we going to get the president that was a self proclaimed dealmaker
in the Senate for his entire career?]{.underline} Are we going to get
the guy that's down in Georgia \[for\] a face-saving speech to his base
because he can't get something through the Senate?" asked Rep. Kelly
Armstrong (R-N.D.). "A lot of it depends on which president we get."
Indeed, Armstrong and other Republicans singled out the tone of Biden's
speech in Georgia last week, in which the president suggested that
lawmakers who oppose Democrats' voting rights legislation will be on the
same side of history as segregationists and the head of the Confederacy.
McConnell quickly condemned Biden's remarks, calling them "beneath his
office," and Biden later sought to clarify that he hadn't made that
direct comparison about the GOP leader. One telling metric: Even
Republicans who voted to impeach Trump last year aren't sure whether
they can find any substantive common ground with Biden if they are in
the majority. "Boy, [my answer would have been a lot different a year
ago," said]{.underline} freshman [Rep]{.underline}. Peter
[Meijer]{.underline} (R-Mich.), who voted to impeach Donald Trump
earlier this year. ["I've been astounded at the number of areas where
we'll talk with people from the administration. ... And then **just
nothing happens**."]{.underline}

#### Dems holding onto the Senate, staying close to 50 Senators enough to prevent change in agenda

If it\'s the usual one---\"[Will Republicans take over majorities in
Congress?]{.underline}\"---then sure, there\'s a lot of evidence to say
[yes]{.underline}, they will. But that\'s not a very profound insight,
is it? The President\'s party has almost always bled seats in midterms,
and this year, even a handful of losses will mean a Republican majority.
Even Presidents with soaring approval ratings still lose an average of
three House seats in midterm elections, and we all know that President
Biden\'s approval is 11 points below his disapproval. Reflecting the
Democrats\' unpopularity more widely, the \"generic ballot\" polling
question has the Democrats down 2.5 percent. But what if [that\'s the

that there are two much more important questions we should be asking as
we close in on November\'s midterms. **[Can the Democrats keep things

to lose their majority---a question we can all agree is best answered
with a yes---I\'d argue that we should be asking whether the Democrats
can keep things close. If you\'re thinking that \"close\" only counts in
horseshoes and hand grenades, think again: There\'s a huge difference
between losing narrowly and getting blown out, for the same reason that
you\'d rather be down a field goal than two touchdowns at halftime. The

OFFERS \> For one thing, **[if Democrats can hold just the Senate, they
retain critical levers of power that are currently making a real
difference]{.underline}**. Consider the fact that President Biden has
been getting his nominees for federal judges confirmed at a record pace,
offsetting some of President Trump\'s massive reshaping of the
judiciary. [The Democratic-led Senate has successfully confirmed 369 of
521 nominees for key agency positions so far, and given congressional
gridlock, these are the people shaping most of what is happening in
government.]{.underline} As just one example, note that the Trump
Administration rolled back 112 environmental rules, 30 of them on
emissions. Now, Biden\'s agencies are overturning those changes,
including critical rules on fuel standards, gas pipelines, and methane
emissions. They need the leadership in place to keep that going. But
**[even if Democrats lose the Senate, keeping the margins narrow means
having to take out fewer Republican office-holders in
2024.]{.underline}** That matters because incumbents usually start off
with about a three-point election advantage. Moreover, consider the fact
that [slim House majorities are much harder to manage than fat
ones]{.underline}. Just look at Nancy Pelosi\'s recent headaches; the
most vulnerable representatives are always on the hot seat. A big
majority allows those swing seat members to go against their party on
the toughest votes and look bipartisan. Without that shield, the biggest
targets are exposed. The good news for Democrats is that the chances of
limiting their losses are actually fairly high. Modeling from
highly-regarded analyst Alan Abramowitz suggests that Democrats
currently have an even shot to hold the Senate and are on track to lose
only about 20 House seats. It\'s not great, but it\'s within striking
distance, and would be hardly a \"shellacking.\" But there\'s a second
and even better question we should be asking, and it\'s this: **[Can
Democrats win enough races to protect American democracy from
disaster?]{.underline}** America is likely facing an existential crisis
in 2024 from Big Lie MAGAists planning to subvert elections to reinstate
Donald Trump or a near clone. Bill Clinton once said that our priority
was to \"save Social Security first.\" Today, the mantra has to be
\"save democracy first.\" Can Democrats accomplish that?
**[Yes]{.underline}**. Step one is to limit their 2022 losses for the
reasons noted above, and also because if they can stay positioned to win
back enough seats in 2024, it lowers the chances that Republicans can
pull another Eastman Memo maneuver, muck with the electoral count, and
have the election decided by cronies in the House. Second, Democrats
must focus on keeping the Big Lie cabal from winning strategically
important offices and legislative majorities in swing states. Closely
divided bodies that could flip in 2022 include chambers in Arizona,
Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Secretaries of State will be at the
epicenter of the assault on elections, so Democrats must hold offices
like Michigan and flip offices in states like Arizona, Georgia, and
Nevada. Just to give a sense of the stakes, in Colorado the Democratic
Secretary of State, a person who has received countless death threats,
is up against a Republican county clerk facing criminal charges for
tampering with voting equipment and who a judge barred from overseeing
elections. In Pennsylvania, the Republican nominee for governor is a
leading voice in the election denial movement and gets to pick the
Secretary of State. Democrats must win as many of these critical races
as possible. And is that do-able? Yes. Posing the right question means
focusing on what you really care about. Democratic doomscrolling of the
midterm election is understandable---it has the same appeal as watching
the Johnny Depp trial---but what has to matter most is making sure there
are still elections to care about in the future, to say nothing of the
broader aim the party is supposed to stand for: an inclusive and
ever-expanding vision of opportunity. Those are the real goals. And yes,
Democrats can still achieve them, even if they lose in the midterms. [Of
course, the Democrats could still turn this around completely: There are
historical outliers where the President\'s party held serve, and plenty
of times where Republicans nominated such extreme candidates that they
lost winnable races.]{.underline} But in general, the basic positioning
of the parties tends to hold in the runup to an election, while jolts to
the race tend to work against the party that holds the White House.
Which is why Democrats should be focused on the achievable goals that
are very much in reach.

"An Earth Day Reminder of How the Republicans Have Forsaken the
Environment ," April 22, 2022,
https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/an-earth-day-reminder-of-how-the-republicans-have-forsaken-the-environment

The idea for Earth Day came to Gaylord Nelson all of a sudden one day in
the middle of 1969. That summer, "teach-ins" about the Vietnam War were
all the rage. It occurred to Nelson, then the junior U.S. senator from
Wisconsin: How about a "teach-in" about the environment? To attract the
widest possible audience, Nelson, a Democrat, invited Representative
Pete McCloskey, a Republican from California, to co-chair the event. The
response was way more enthusiastic than either man had anticipated: on
April 22, 1970, some twenty million Americans---a tenth of the country's
population---took to the streets. It was the largest public
demonstration in U.S. history, and, as Jamie Henn, one of the founders
of 350.org, has put it, it "had bite." By the end of the year, a
Republican President, Richard Nixon, had created the Environmental
Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. This was followed in relatively short order by the
passage of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Endangered
Species Act. All of these measures were approved with overwhelming
bipartisan support. Today, as Earth Day turns fifty, it's hard to
imagine more dolorous circumstances for the occasion. covid-19 has
forced online (or cancelled) virtually all the celebrations and protests
that had been planned for the anniversary[. The Trump
Administration]{.underline} has barely even taken the day off from
gutting the nation's environmental regulations. (Last week, the
Administration [weakened rules governing the emission of mercury and
other toxic chemicals from power plants]{.underline}; late last month[,
it weakened fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks.)
Meanwhile, in Congress, environmental protection has become]{.underline}
such [a thoroughly partisan issue]{.underline} that across-the-aisle
collaborations like Nelson and McCloskey's are rarer than Amur leopards.
[Owing to this divide, **environmental problems** that have emerged
since 1970 **have** simply **gone unaddressed**]{.underline}. Congress
has not passed---or even really come close to passing---a single piece
of legislation aimed at addressing climate change. (All the steps taken
by the Obama Administration to try to curb carbon emissions were done
through regulation.) Precisely at the "moment when such legislative
action is most needed," James Morton Turner, a professor at Wellesley
College, and Andrew Isenberg, a professor at the University of Kansas,
have written, it has become "almost politically unimaginable." How and
why this happened is the subject of Turner and Isenberg's recent book,
"The Republican Reversal: Conservatives and the Environment from Nixon
to Trump." The two trace the G.O.P.'s turn against conservation to
Ronald Reagan, who equated environmentalism with pessimism, and
pessimism with a lack of patriotism. [Reagan]{.underline} combined a
sunny faith in the future with an equally sunny indifference to facts.
Running for President in 1980, he [claimed that acid rain was not caused
by power-plant and auto emissions, as scientists had shown, but by the
eruption of Mt. St. Helens]{.underline}, in Washington State, earlier
that year. Also during the campaign, he declared that "eighty per cent
of our air pollution stems from hydrocarbons released by vegetation."
Once elected, Reagan appointed Anne Gorsuch---an inexperienced ideologue
(and the mother of the future Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch)---to
head the E.P.A. Among her first moves was to propose slashing the
agency's budget by more than forty per cent. One staffer complained that
morale was so low there was "no known scientific method to measure it."
Since Reagan, control of the White House has, of course, swung between
the parties, as has control of Congress. Throughout the swings,
[anti-environmentalism has only become that much more entrenched in
G.O.P. politics]{.underline}. (McCloskey, it's worth noting, switched
his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat, in 2007, at the age
of seventy-nine.) A great deal of money has changed hands to help change
minds; according to the Web site Open Secrets, which tracks federal
campaign contributions[, the oil-and-gas industry contributed nearly
twenty-four million dollars to House and Senate Republicans]{.underline}
during the past election cycle, [compared with five million to
Democrats]{.underline}. But, according to Turner and Isenberg, money is
only part of the equation; the other part is votes. [For
Republican]{.underline} [politicians, there's **no incentive
to**,]{.underline} say[, **back legislation to limit climate
change**]{.underline}: "Neither their corporate donors nor evangelicals
nor the struggling Rust Belt workers who voted for Trump in 2016 see any
advantage to it." The situation is such that, as Aaron Huertas, who
works with WeCanVote.US, recently pointed out, were Democrats inclined
to pass meaningful climate legislation, they'd need to win not just the
Presidency this fall but also a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.
Can this situation be changed? Certainly the hour is late and the
facts---if you happen to be concerned about such things---are stark.
What the original Earth Day showed is that, when Americans are
mobilized, remarkable things are possible. What the past few years have
shown is that Americans can be mobilized by the most remarkable
falsehoods. To say that the future of the world depends on which of
these tendencies prevails is at this point, unfortunately, no
exaggeration.

#### Warming leads to extinction

**Kareiva 18**, Ph.D. in ecology and applied mathematics from Cornell
University, director of the Institute of the Environment and
Sustainability at UCLA, Pritzker Distinguished Professor in Environment
& Sustainability at UCLA, et al. (Peter, "Existential risk due to
ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes back," *Futures*, 102)

In summary, six of the nine proposed planetary boundaries (phosphorous,
nitrogen, biodiversity, land use, atmospheric aerosol loading, and
chemical pollution) are unlikely to be associated with existential
risks. They all correspond to a degraded environment, but in our
assessment do not represent existential risks. However, the three
remaining boundaries ([climate change, global freshwater cycle, and
ocean acidification]{.underline}) do [pose **existential
risks**]{.underline}. [This is because of intrinsic **positive feedback
loops**]{.underline}, substantial lag times between system change and
experiencing the consequences of that change, [and the fact these
different boundaries interact with one another in ways that yield
**surprises**]{.underline}. In addition, [climate, freshwater, and ocean
acidification are all directly connected to the provision of **food**
and **water**, and shortages]{.underline} of food and water can [create
**conflict** and social unrest]{.underline}. Climate change has a long
history of disrupting civilizations and sometimes precipitating the
collapse of cultures or mass emigrations (McMichael, 2017). For example,
the 12th century drought in the North American Southwest is held
responsible for the collapse of the Anasazi pueblo culture. More
recently, the infamous potato famine of 1846--1849 and the large
migration of Irish to the U.S. can be traced to a combination of
factors, one of which was climate. Specifically, 1846 was an unusually
warm and moist year in Ireland, providing the climatic conditions
favorable to the fungus that caused the potato blight. As is so often
the case, poor government had a role as well---as the British government
forbade the import of grains from outside Britain (imports that could
have helped to redress the ravaged potato yields). [Climate change
intersects with freshwater resources because it is expected to
**exacerbate drought** and]{.underline} [**water
scarcity**,]{.underline} as well as flooding. Climate change can even
impair water quality because it is associated with heavy rains that
overwhelm sewage treatment facilities, or because it results in higher
concentrations of pollutants in groundwater as a result of enhanced
evaporation and reduced groundwater recharge. [Ample clean
water]{.underline} is not a luxury---it [is essential for human
survival.]{.underline} Consequently, cities, regions and nations that
lack clean freshwater are vulnerable to social disruption and disease.
Finally, ocean acidification is linked to climate change because it is
driven by CO2 emissions just as global warming is. With close to 20% of
the world's protein coming from oceans (FAO, 2016), the potential for
severe impacts due to acidification is obvious. Less obvious, but
perhaps more insidious, is the interaction between climate change and
the loss of oyster and coral reefs due to acidification. Acidification
is known to interfere with oyster reef building and coral reefs.
[Climate change also increases **storm frequency** and severity. Coral
reefs and oyster reefs provide protection from storm surge because they
reduce wave energy]{.underline} (Spalding et al., 2014). [If these reefs
are lost due to acidification at the same time as storms become more
severe and sea level rises]{.underline}, **[coastal communities will be
exposed to unprecedented storm surge]{.underline}**---[and may be
ravaged by recurrent storms]{.underline}. A key feature of the risk
associated with climate change is that mean annual temperature and mean
annual rainfall are not the variables of interest. Rather it is extreme
episodic events that place nations and entire regions of the world at
risk. These extreme events are by definition "rare" (once every hundred
years), and changes in their likelihood are challenging to detect
because of their rarity, but are exactly the manifestations of climate
change that we must get better at anticipating (Diffenbaugh et al.,
2017). [Society will have a hard time responding to shorter intervals
between rare **extreme events**]{.underline} because in the lifespan of
an individual human, a person might experience as few as two or three
extreme events. How likely is it that you would notice a change in the
interval between events that are separated by decades, especially given
that the interval is not regular but varies stochastically? A concrete
example of this dilemma can be found in the past and expected future
changes in storm-related flooding of New York City. The highly
disruptive flooding of New York City associated with Hurricane Sandy
represented a flood height that occurred once every 500 years in the
18th century, and that occurs now once [every 25 years, but is expected
to occur once every 5 years by 2050]{.underline} (Garner et al., 2017).
This change in frequency of extreme floods has profound implications for
the measures New York City should take to protect its infrastructure and
its population, yet because of the stochastic nature of such events,
this shift in flood frequency is an elevated risk that will go unnoticed
by most people. 4. The combination of positive feedback loops and
societal inertia is fertile ground for global environmental catastrophes
[Humans are remarkably ingenious, and have **adapted** to crises
throughout their history]{.underline}. Our doom has been repeatedly
predicted, only to be averted by innovation (Ridley, 2011). [However,
the many stories of human ingenuity successfully addressing existential
risks]{.underline} such as global famine or extreme air pollution
[represent environmental challenges that are largely linear, have
immediate consequences, and operate without positive
feedbacks.]{.underline} For example, the fact that food is in short
supply does not increase the rate at which humans consume food---thereby
increasing the shortage. Similarly, massive air pollution episodes such
as the London fog of 1952 that killed 12,000 people did not make future
air pollution events more likely. In fact it was just the opposite---the
London fog sent such a clear message that Britain quickly enacted
pollution control measures (Stradling, 2016). Food shortages, air
pollution, water pollution, etc. send immediate signals to society of
harm, which then trigger a negative feedback of society seeking to
reduce the harm. In contrast, today's great environmental crisis of
climate change may cause some harm but there are generally long time
delays between rising CO2 concentrations and damage to humans. The
consequence of these delays are an absence of urgency; thus although 70%
of Americans believe global warming is happening, only 40% think it will
harm them
(http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/).
Secondly, [unlike past environmental challenges, **the Earth's climate
system is rife with positive feedback loops**]{.underline}. [In
particular, as CO2 increases and the climate warms, that very warming
can cause more CO2 release which further increases global warming, and
then more CO2, and so on]{.underline}. Table 2 summarizes the best
documented positive feedback loops for the Earth's climate system. These
feedbacks can be neatly categorized into carbon cycle, biogeochemical,
biogeophysical, cloud, ice-albedo, and water vapor feedbacks. As
important as it is to understand these feedbacks individually, it is
even more essential to study the interactive nature of these feedbacks.
Modeling studies show that when interactions among feedback loops are
included, uncertainty increases dramatically and there is a heightened
potential for perturbations to be magnified (e.g., Cox, Betts, Jones,
Spall, & Totterdell, 2000; Hajima, Tachiiri, Ito, & Kawamiya, 2014;
Knutti & Rugenstein, 2015; Rosenfeld, Sherwood, Wood, & Donner, 2014).
This produces a wide range of future scenarios. Positive feedbacks in
the carbon cycle involves the enhancement of future carbon contributions
to the atmosphere due to some initial increase in atmospheric CO2. This
happens because as CO2 accumulates, it reduces the efficiency in which
oceans and terrestrial ecosystems sequester carbon, which in return
feeds back to exacerbate climate change (Friedlingstein et al., 2001).
Warming can also increase the rate at which organic matter decays and
carbon is released into the atmosphere, thereby causing more warming
(Melillo et al., 2017). Increases in food shortages and lack of water is
also of major concern when biogeophysical feedback mechanisms perpetuate
drought conditions. The underlying mechanism here is that losses in
vegetation increases the surface albedo, which suppresses rainfall, and
thus enhances future vegetation loss and more suppression of
rainfall---thereby initiating or prolonging a drought (Chamey, Stone, &
Quirk, 1975). To top it off, overgrazing depletes the soil, leading to
augmented vegetation loss (Anderies, Janssen, & Walker, 2002). Climate
change often also increases the risk of forest fires, as a result of
higher temperatures and persistent drought conditions. [The expectation
is that forest fires will become more frequent and severe with climate
warming and drought]{.underline} (Scholze, Knorr, Arnell, & Prentice,
2006), a trend for which we have already seen evidence (Allen et al.,
2010). Tragically, the increased severity and risk of Southern
California wildfires recently predicted by climate scientists (Jin et
al., 2015), was realized in December 2017, with the largest fire in the
history of California (the "Thomas fire" that burned 282,000 acres,
https://www.vox.com/2017/12/27/16822180/thomas-fire-california-largest-wildfire).
[This catastrophic fire embodies the sorts of positive feedbacks and
interacting factors that could **catch humanity off-guard**]{.underline}
[and produce a true **apocalyptic event**]{.underline}. Record-breaking
rains produced an extraordinary flush of new vegetation, that then dried
out as record heat waves and dry conditions took hold, coupled with
stronger than normal winds, and ignition. Of course the record-fire
released CO2 into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to future
warming. Out of all types of feedbacks, water vapor and the ice-albedo
feedbacks are the most clearly understood mechanisms. Losses in
reflective snow and ice cover drive up surface temperatures, leading to
even more melting of snow and ice cover---this is known as the
ice-albedo feedback (Curry, Schramm, & Ebert, 1995). As snow and ice
continue to melt at a more rapid pace, millions of people may be
displaced by flooding risks as a consequence of sea level rise near
coastal communities (Biermann & Boas, 2010; Myers, 2002; Nicholls et
al., 2011). The water vapor feedback operates when warmer atmospheric
conditions strengthen the saturation vapor pressure, which creates a
warming effect given water vapor's strong greenhouse gas properties
(Manabe & Wetherald, 1967). Global warming tends to increase cloud
formation because warmer temperatures lead to more evaporation of water
into the atmosphere, and warmer temperature also allows the atmosphere
to hold more water. The key question is whether this increase in clouds
associated with global warming will result in a positive feedback loop
(more warming) or a negative feedback loop (less warming). For decades,
scientists have sought to answer this question and understand the net
role clouds play in future climate projections (Schneider et al., 2017).
Clouds are complex because they both have a cooling (reflecting incoming
solar radiation) and warming (absorbing incoming solar radiation) effect
(Lashof, DeAngelo, Saleska, & Harte, 1997). The type of cloud, altitude,
and optical properties combine to determine how these countervailing
effects balance out. Although still under debate, it appears that in
most circumstances the cloud feedback is likely positive (Boucher et
al., 2013). For example, models and observations show that increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations reduces the low-level cloud fraction in
the Northeast Pacific at decadal time scales. This then has a positive
feedback effect and enhances climate warming since less solar radiation
is reflected by the atmosphere (Clement, Burgman, & Norris, 2009). [The
key lesson from the long list of potentially positive feedbacks and
their interactions is that]{.underline} [**runaway climate change**, and
runaway perturbations have to be taken as a serious
possibility]{.underline}. Table 2 is just a snapshot of the type of
feedbacks that have been identified (see Supplementary material for a
more thorough explanation of positive feedback loops). However, [this
list is not exhaustive and the possibility of undiscovered positive
feedbacks portends **even greater existential risks**]{.underline}. The
many environmental crises humankind has previously averted (famine,
ozone depletion, London fog, water pollution, etc.) were averted because
of political will based on solid scientific understanding. We cannot
count on complete scientific understanding when it comes to positive
feedback loops and climate change.

### Dems good -- laundry list

#### Democrats win is good -- federal judges, GOP agenda, investigations, 2024 Senate

matters ⁠--- even if they lose the House\". 5-2-2022. Vox.

If Democrats lose the House this fall, as they're widely expected to,
their ability to do ambitious bills will be all but moot. Given
Republican opposition, it's likely most legislation, barring must-pass
measures like appropriations, will be dead on arrival. That prompts the
question: Does it matter if they lose the Senate, too? In fact, holding
their majority in the upper chamber is still extremely important for a
number of reasons, perhaps none more so than the courts. If elected, a
Democratic Senate would be able to confirm more of President Joe Biden's
judicial nominees, including any upcoming theoretical Supreme Court
pick. Even without the House, they could approve judges for district
courts, circuit courts, and the high court with a simple Senate
majority. And that's not the only benefit: Keeping this majority would
also mean that lawmakers could set their own floor agenda and reject
bills approved by a GOP-led House. Senate Democrats could ensure, too,
that hearings and committee time aren't used on investigations of Biden
and other members of his administration. "Given that it will be
investigations on steroids over in the House, the question is how the
Senate could serve as a buffer," says Democratic strategist Jim Manley,
a former staffer for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Securing
that buffer won't be easy as the prospects for Democrats this fall are
looking increasingly grim. Due to the backlash the president's party
typically faces, and other factors like the country's ongoing struggles
with inflation, Democrats are likely to see some major losses in the
House and have no room for error in the Senate. Because of the 2022
Senate map and candidates' past patterns of bucking national trends,
however, Democrats have a slightly better chance of sustaining their
narrow hold on the upper chamber. Three reasons Senate control matters
[Democrats would be pretty limited legislatively under divided
government --- but there are **still**]{.underline} three [**key areas
where Senate control matters**. **Judges**]{.underline} "[The main
difference between a split Congress and one controlled by Republicans
completely would be Biden's ability to fill judicial and other
vacancies]{.underline}," says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's
Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia. [A GOP Senate majority would
be able to vote down Biden's judicial nominees]{.underline} (including
any that come up on the Supreme Court), block them wholesale from
consideration, and pressure the White House to pick what they perceive
as more moderate options. Republican lawmakers have already signaled
that they may not consider Biden's nominees. In April, Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell wouldn't commit to giving a Supreme Court pick a
hearing in 2023 if the Republicans retook their majority. It's something
he's done before: During the Obama administration, McConnell notably
blocked Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from ever getting a
hearing by arguing that his nomination was in an election year. Sen.
Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has said that the "Garland rule" could be used if
a high court vacancy comes up in 2024. [Such opposition could seriously
stymie Biden's efforts on the courts]{.underline}: In his first year,
Biden appointed the most federal judges of any president since Ronald
Reagan, including more women, more people of color, and more public
defenders than his predecessors. [His attempts to continue doing so
would be severely constrained without a Democratic Senate
majority.]{.underline} Since these judges have lifetime appointments,
their appointments have long-term impacts that extend far beyond the
administration that nominated them. Trump and a Republican-controlled
Senate confirmed more than 200 judges during his presidency, many of
whom have contributed to pivotal decisions on immigration policy, mask
mandates, and abortion rights. **[Setting legislative
priorities]{.underline}** In the majority, Democrats would be able to
set the floor schedule and ignore bills that Republicans send over from
the House. "[It's crucial to keep the Senate if only to serve as a
bulwark against every bad idea that House Republicans]{.underline} are
going to [think of]{.underline} when they try to send them over to the
Senate," said Manley. [If Republicans had Senate control, any bills that
passed both chambers could still be vetoed by Biden. In the process,
however, they could force vulnerable Democrats to take difficult votes
on contentious issues.]{.underline} Similarly, Republicans could use
tools like the Congressional Review Act and budget resolutions for
messaging votes. Using the CRA, lawmakers could try to undo rules
recently imposed by the Biden administration. If a simple majority in
both chambers disapproves of a rule, they can pass a resolution trying
to repeal it. Biden could also veto this, but Democrats would be pushed
to take tough votes on the administration's policies in the interim.
Budget resolutions also only require a simple majority to pass the
Senate and could be another forum for Republicans to score political
points. Using these resolutions, which are also subject to a
presidential veto, they could approve changes to the tax code or
spending on climate programs and reproductive health.
**[Investigations]{.underline}** Republicans have already vowed to serve
as a check on the Biden administration once they retake the majority in
either chamber. House Republicans, for example, have announced plans to
investigate the business practices of the president's son Hunter Biden,
and even pursue impeachment of certain Cabinet members. "Immediately,
the House Republicans are going to start investigating the White House
and the administration, basically looking for anything to embarrass the
administration as much as they can," says Neilan Chaturvedi, a political
science professor at Cal Poly Pomona. While a GOP-controlled House would
be able to dedicate time and resources to these efforts, [a
Democrat-controlled Senate could make sure that their chamber's
committees didn't focus hearings on these issues]{.underline}.
Additionally, the Senate could attempt to avoid a trial if the House
approves articles of impeachment for an administration official. "The
House could go ahead and vote to impeach, but there is some ambiguity
about whether or not the Senate is compelled to hold a trial," said
George Washington University political science professor Sarah Binder.
[**Democrats' 2022 wins could decide control of the Senate for years**
Democratic wins this cycle would cushion potential losses the party
could experience in the next election]{.underline}. Since senators hold
six-year terms, anyone elected in 2022 would play a major role in
preserving the party's numbers for Congressional terms to come. "I think
[it matters more down the line because Democrats are staring at a really
brutal map in 2024]{.underline}," says Cook Political Report's Jessica
Taylor. As Vox's Andrew Prokop has explained, Democrats aren't currently
defending any seats in states that Trump took in 2020. The four most
contentious Democratic seats that are up --- Nevada, Georgia, New
Hampshire, and Arizona --- are all places Biden won. Two other swing
seats currently held by Republicans --- Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ---
are also places Biden previously won, putting them in Democrats'
potential reach. The 2024 map, however, is far more challenging. That
year, Democrats will be defending Sen. Joe Manchin's seat in West
Virginia, Sen. Jon Tester's seat in Montana, and Sen. Sherrod Brown's
seat in Ohio, all states that voted for Trump in the last election.
Additionally, several other Democrat-held seats will be up in states
like Arizona, Michigan, and Maine. Essentially, the more seats Democrats
can win in 2022, the better position they'll have to withstand any
shake-ups two years from now.

Despite everything you've heard, [there are]{.underline} still [plenty
of reasons Democrats could do much better in November's midterm
elections than Republicans]{.underline} and much of the media expect. In
fact, the future of American democracy depends on it. Democrats
certainly know in normal election years a new president's party
historically loses congressional seats in the first midterms because
opponents angry over losing power are more motivated than the winners to
vote in low-turnout midterms. But every American also should realize
there will never be another normal election year in this country until
Republicans free themselves from the control of their defeated president
and the violent militias and hate groups that support him who refuse to
accept the results of free and fair elections. [Rather than distancing
themselves from their divisive, unpopular president]{.underline} who was
thrown out of office after a single term by the largest voter turnout in
history, [Republican leaders]{.underline} who know better [have
joined]{.underline} a lunatic fringe within their party [in supporting
Donald Trump's]{.underline} preposterous [lie President Biden somehow
stole the election]{.underline} by manufacturing millions of fraudulent
votes. Extreme Candidates As a result, Republicans will be saddled with
a lot of extreme candidates in those November midterms they're so
confident of winning. Adding to the chaos will be Trump himself
campaigning for the worst among them who are running against Republicans
he wants to punish for accepting accurate election results or condemning
his supporters' terrorist attack on the Capitol. [Trump is one of the
best agents Democrats have to get out the vote in their
party]{.underline}. [In the past two national elections, Democrats set
new voter turnout records in the 2018 midterms flipping 40 seats to gain
House control and in 2020 defeating Trump]{.underline}. 2022 could make
it three in a row. The absurd Republican candidates in the midterms
include at least five running for House seats who actively participated
in that violent Jan. 6 insurrection. A New Hampshire candidate promises
to run from prison if he's incarcerated for breaking into the Capitol.
[The Ron Johnson Opportunity Wisconsin already provided a prime
opportunity in the midterms for Democrats to increase Senate control by
flipping the seat held by Ron Johnson]{.underline}, a national
embarrassment who's denied the violence of the attack resulting in five
deaths and serious brain injuries to police beaten with iron pipes,
hockey sticks and baseball bats. He's discouraged vaccinations during
the latest surge of a new, highly contagious COVID variant endangering
the lives of the unvaccinated. Johnson could be joined on the midterm
ballot by former Republican Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch running against
Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Kleefisch enthusiastically supports Trump's
fraudulent election claims and Michael Gableman's corrupt investigation
into Biden's victory in Wisconsin for Assembly Republicans that's
expected to recommend new Wisconsin voting restrictions. All but the
most dimwitted Republican leaders have to realize how dangerous Trump
and his violent supporters are to the future of democracy. But they
believe they need Trump's supporters to win the midterms. They'll worry
about controlling the contempt for democracy in their party later. By
then, they'll be the ones under control. The Good News So here's some
more positive news about how much better the political landscape could
be for Democrats in those fall midterms. The media have been warning us
Republican state legislatures can easily win control of the House of
Representatives with their usual corrupt gerrymandering of congressional
districts in response to the 2020 census. Surprise, it's not happening.
The latest analysis by David Wasserman, redistricting expert for the
non-partisan Cook Political Report, concludes redistricting is on track
to create a congressional map slightly less biased in favor of
Republicans than it's been for the past decade. It should actually add a
few more Biden-won districts. Wisconsin was specifically cited for one
of the biggest ironies. After the racist anti-Obama tea party elections
of 2010, Wisconsin and other Republican states drew such extremely
gerrymandered maps it's difficult for Republicans to make them any
worse. In some Republican states, nonpartisan commissions and courts
also are making a difference. Here's more positive news for Democrats
you haven't heard nearly enough about. Nobel-prize-winning economist and
columnist Paul Krugman described the first year of Biden's presidency as
"a year of spectacular economic recovery." In early November, [a Federal
Reserve survey of economists predicted a year-end unemployment rate of
5.8%. Instead, November's unemployment was 4.2% declining further to
3.9% in December. If supply chain problems keep easing in the coming
year to reduce inflation, Biden's economic success will
continue]{.underline}. Here's more. Not even Joe Manchin or Kyrsten
Sinema want their party to be the minority in the Senate after the
midterms. They'll vote for a substantial new package of Biden's Build
Back Better legislation before long to improve the everyday lives of
ordinary Americans. [Biden and Democrats could go into the midterms in
good shape after another successful year.]{.underline} That would be
very good news for American democracy.

### Non-unique -- Roe

#### Outrage over Roe vs Wade overturn [flips the script]{.underline} on midterms - democrats will win now 

**Morgan 06/24** \[Morgan, David, reuters.com, "With Roe overturned,
U.S. Democrats turn abortion battle to November midterms",

Date accessed: June 24^th^ 2022\]

WASHINGTON, June 24 (Reuters) - [**Leading Democrats sought to turn
Friday\'s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade into a rallying
cry for the November elections**, warning of grim consequences for
women, contraception and gay marriage if Republicans regain control of
Congress]{.underline}. In a 5-4 ruling powered by its conservative
majority, the high court overturned the 1973 landmark decision that had
recognized a woman\'s right to an abortion, and had legalized it
nationwide, for nearly half a century. [The decision was greeted as a
stunning victory by anti-abortion Republicans and other conservatives,
while Democrats and abortion-right activists protested what they
described as a step backwards for the rights of American women. But with
control of the House of Representatives and the Senate at stake in the
Nov. 8 midterm elections, Democrats also warned that the rights of women
and others would face further dangers if Republicans regain control of
Congress.]{.underline} \"The Republicans are plotting a nationwide
abortion ban. They cannot be allowed to have a majority in the Congress
to do that,\" said House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the
chamber\'s top Democrat, told reporters. \"It is clear that we just have
to win a majority in November. Everything is at stake,\" added Pelosi, a
Catholic who was barred from taking communion last month by the
archbishop of San Francisco because of her support for abortion rights.
[**About 71% of Americans - including majorities of Democrats and
Republicans - say decisions about terminating a pregnancy should be left
to a woman and her doctor, rather than regulated by the** government,
according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.]{.underline} [Democrats hope **voter
anger about the Supreme Court\'s decision will help them retain their
razor-thin margins of control in the House and Senate**]{.underline}.
With President Joe Biden\'s approval rating slumping, most forecasters
have so far favored Republicans\' chances of winning a majority in at
least the House. \"This fall, Roe is on the ballot. Personal freedoms
are on the ballot. The right to privacy, liberty, equality are all about
it,\" Biden said on Friday. It was not clear how easily Democrats could
use the abortion rights message to mobilize support. Despite having
control of the White House and both chambers of Congress for nearly 18
months, Biden and his Democratic allies have disappointed their core
supporters with repeated failures on hot-button issues including
abortion, voting rights and social spending. Efforts to reform the
Senate filibuster and overcome Republican opposition to the Biden agenda
have been hamstrung by opposition from within their own party,
specifically Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Even
their success at enacting moderate gun-safety legislation proved
uninspiring to strong gun-control advocates and was overshadowed twice
by the Supreme Court, which broadly expanded gun rights a day before
overturning Roe v. Wade. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said
voters would now have a clear choice between Democrats and \"MAGA
Republicans,\" using an acronym for allies of former President Donald
Trump. \"Elect more MAGA Republicans if you want nationwide abortion
bans, the jailing of women and doctors and no exemptions for rape or
incest. Or, elect more pro-choice Democrats to save Roe,\" Schumer said
in a statement. House Republicans welcomed the ruling and talked openly
about a path forward to \"end abortion in this country.\" \"The Supreme
Court\'s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, overturning that flawed
decision finally allows states and Congress to protect life in ways that
we never were able to for the last 50 years,\" Representative Steve
Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, told reporters.

Still, [some **Republicans believe** that the **Supreme Court\'s
decision** will backfire **against their party**]{.underline}, including
former President Donald Trump, who privately told his advisers that
[**overturning Roe** is \"**bad** **for Republicans**\"]{.underline} as
it could potentially impact some key voters such as suburban women, The
New York Times reported Friday. Jason Roe, the former executive director
of the state Republican Party in Michigan, said he is \"nervous\" about
the political implications of the Court\'s decision, according to
Politico, because \"the opportunities we should have with suburban women
become more complicated when that issue is on the table, and I think it
puts us on defense.\" One Trump adviser said that the former president
is \"convinced it won\'t help him in the future,\" referring to
abortion, according to The Washington Post on Friday, and that it is
better if other issues became the primary focus in the wake of the
midterms and the 2024 election. However, the [**Court\'s
ruling**]{.underline} might [work **in the Democrats\'** favor,
according to a former GOP congressman]{.underline}, who preferred to be
anonymous. \"**[The]{.underline}** only [**thing** \[Democrats\] have
got **going for them is** the **Roe** thing]{.underline}, which is what,
40 years of settled law that will be changed that will cause some
societal consternation,\" the congressman told Politico. \"And can they
turn that into some turnout? I think the answer is probably \'Yes.\'\"
\"Maybe instead of losing 45 seats, they lose 30,\" he added. \"There
will be a few seats that Republicans would have won without \[the
abortion rights decision\], and they may not win them now.\" Meanwhile,
a Republican operative familiar with polling in state and federal races,
who also spoke with Politico on the condition of anonymity, noted that
overturning Roe impacts swing voters who lean Republican. [\"It takes a
sizeable bloc of voters who were leaning \[Republican\], and **it gives
them reason to vote Democrat**,\"]{.underline} he said. \"And they
haven\'t had any reason to vote Democrat in quite a while.\" Political
commentator S.E. Cupp told CNN on Friday that politically she \"[can\'t
imagine a better voter turnout engine than this ruling for
Democrats]{.underline}\" in the midterms. \"And you can make the
argument that the Republicans\' legislative victories and the Supreme
Court victory by a conservative court are regressive, they\'re taking us
backwards. Whether you like them or not, you can\'t deny the fact that
[they\'re going backwards\...They\'re taking us back to a different time
when these weren\'t rights,\"]{.underline} she said, and added: \"It
really does feel anachronistic with where the country is, and so I think
that\'s a good message for Democrats.\" Newsweek reached out to
political scientist at Georgetown University Hans Noel, the spokesperson
for Republican political strategist Sarah Longwell, and Republican
political strategist Danny Diaz for comment.

### Uniqueness overwhelms

#### The Democrats will be wiped out -- history, Biden approval, inflation, secondary issues

6-26-2022

In 2020, my firm reached one of its peaks, correctly calling close but
clear wins for the Democrats in the House of Representatives and the
presidency, as well as precisely predicting the 50-50 split in the
Senate. For all our pride in this, the 2022 midterms are just around the
corner, with a new set of political imperatives that need to be
mastered. So, without further ado, here we go: **[The 2022 midterms will
result in a Republican wipeout of the Democrats]{.underline}**, with the
GOP gaining upwards of 30 seats in the House and one or two in the
Senate, giving them full control of the Congress. Here is the case for
our bold prediction.

First, [the historical record is squarely against President Joe Biden
and the Democrats. Since 1870, only four elections out of 38 resulted in
the party holding the White House losing fewer than five seats, which is
the size of the party's present paper-thin majority in the
House.]{.underline} Traditionally, [the country tends to have so-called
buyer's remorse after the first two years of a presidency]{.underline},
either faulting the new team for failing to live up to its campaign
promises or conversely fearing the new White House is trying to do too
much. In either case, the opposition party has been supported 34 out of
38 times as an institutional check on the new president's power.

[The rare exceptions to these overwhelming numbers merely prove the
rule]{.underline}. Only exceptional circumstances ([such as George W.
Bush benefiting from the rally-round-the-flag sentiment prevailing after
9/11]{.underline}) or presidents possessing exceptional political skills
(such as Franklin Roosevelt and Bill Clinton) buck this historical
near-inevitability.

To put it mildly, Biden has neither of these attributes going for him.
In the past generation, [the best guide to a party's congressional
results has been the president's approval numbers]{.underline}, as House
elections have increasingly become nationalized referendums on the
occupant of the White House. The RealClearPolitics' average of polling
finds [Biden's approval ratings under water, with only 42 percent
supporting him, while 53 percent disapprove]{.underline} of the job he
has been doing. Far from bucking the historical trend, Biden's polling
looks set to make it even worse than usual.

Second, [out-of-control 8 percent inflation is seen as by far the most
important issue in polling and the Biden White House entirely owns it.
No one is buying that this is "Putin's price hike,"]{.underline} as the
president has feebly taken to saying in an effort to pass the policy
failure on to the Russian leader. This is not working out in the country
for the simple reason that the beast of inflation had already loosed its
chains well ahead of the Ukraine war starting in late February. The
timing simply does not work for rampant inflation to be anything other
than primarily a Western institutional failure.

While spikes in energy and food prices have resulted directly from the
conflict, they amount to only the icing on the cake. As former Treasury
Secretary Larry Summers has made incisively clear, [the Biden White
House and the Federal Reserve greatly overestimated the damage the
COVID-19 pandemic would do. As a result, the overegged economy had to
deal with 15 percent extra federal spending even as it quickly bounced
back.]{.underline} The obvious result of this pouring gasoline on to a
roaring fire is the present 8 percent-plus inflation the US has and the
cost-of-living crisis that flows naturally from it. Stagflation (the US
economy declined in the first quarter of the year) absolutely destroyed
the presidency of Jimmy Carter 40 years ago. It is now doing the same to
the hapless Biden White House.

Third, [a series of important but secondary issues --- all seen as
traditional weaknesses of the Democratic Party --- are coming back to
bite them. A crime wave in American inner cities]{.underline} has been
blamed on earlier suicidal calls by the left wing of the party to defund
the police. And [illegal immigration at the southern
border]{.underline}, another traditional weakness of the party, has
swollen to a torrent. Finally, [America's families are sick
of]{.underline} recalcitrant (overwhelmingly Democratic) teachers'
unions who indefensibly seem to want their members to stay home for
ever, [how]{.underline}ever [badly the country's children are doing
educationally after years of distance learning. Parents blame the
unions]{.underline} for this calamity, along with their woke allegiance
to a critical race theory that paints America as irredeemably racist.
The self-hatred of the Democratic progressive left is generally a bad
political platform; it is badly wounding the party in general.

[Worse still for the Democrats, none of these things are likely to
change.]{.underline} The historical numbers are what they are; inflation
is unlikely to dramatically trend downwards, and immigration and the
crime wave will not be greatly altered in the next few months. There is
no avoiding the reality that a Democratic Party wipeout in the midterms
is by far the most likely outcome of the 2022 race. This call is an easy
one to make.

Sweep This Year Governing

6-26-2022

[For Democrats this year, the only real question is whether the
elections will be only moderately bad or completely
terrible.]{.underline} If you think like a weather forecaster, all kinds
of data point to a major storm. [By basically every metric you can think
of --- fundraising, candidate recruitment, voter enthusiasm, demographic
shifts --- a big wave is forming that will sweep hundreds of Democrats
out of office, up and down the ticket.]{.underline} The main reason
isn't hard to suss out. [Every president can count on his party losing
seats in midterms]{.underline}, but President [Biden's approval ratings
are particularly bad]{.underline}. On average, 41 percent of Americans
approve of the job he's doing, compared with 54 percent who disapprove.
"That is one of the lowest marks of any president since World War II,"
says Henry Olsen, a conservative analyst at the Ethics and Public Policy
Center. "Unless that changes, I would expect a solid Democratic defeat."
Granted, President Donald [Trump's approval ratings were similarly
bargain basement in 2018]{.underline} --- [but then, Republicans lost
control of the House that year, along with seven
governorships.]{.underline} The more important comparison, at any rate,
is not with Trump but with Biden himself. [Biden won the presidency in
2020 by 4.5 points. If he's down 13, that represents a huge drop in
support, which seriously imperils his party. Swing voters have swung
hard against Biden. His net approval rating among independents is
roughly minus 20.]{.underline} That's a group he carried in 2020 by 13
points, according to exit polls. We've already witnessed a demonstration
of how the president's numbers can drag down other Democrats. Last
November, Biden's net disapproval numbers were 12.5 percent points lower
than his victory margin in 2020. Guess what? The swing from Biden's
share of the vote to that won in 2020 by the Democratic candidates for
governor was 12 points. Gov. Phil Murphy managed barely to hold on in
New Jersey, but [Democrat Terry McAuliffe lost the governorship to
Republican Glenn Youngkin in Virginia --- a state Biden had carried a
year earlier by 10 points. Now, Biden's numbers are even lower than they
were back in November. This means any Democrat who won their last
election by less than double-digit margins should be
nervous.]{.underline} That certainly includes vulnerable governors such
as Tony Evers of Wisconsin and Laura Kelly of Kansas. "The president's
dismal ratings are what people care about the most," says GOP consultant
David Carney. ["It could be a bloodbath up and down the ballot, from the
school board to Congress.\"]{.underline} There are several known
unknowns that could shift the landscape between now and Nov. 8.
Inflation might tick lower and the war in Ukraine may have played out in
a way that helps Biden politically. Perhaps Tuesday's school shooting in
Texas will activate voters in a way that other mass shootings have
failed to do. An NPR/Marist poll released last week found that the
expected Supreme Court action to overturn Roe v. Wade should help
energize Democrats. Sixty-six percent of Democrats said it would make
them more likely to vote this fall, versus 40 percent of Republicans.
["There are two big things that we don't know yet how they will
play:]{.underline} The first one is [the Jan. 6 committee]{.underline}
and its hearings, [and]{.underline} the second one is [this abortion
decision]{.underline}," says Lara Brown, a political scientist at George
Washington University. "Depending on how those capture the attention of
the country and different demographics, I do think that can impact the
magnitude of what ever wave the Republicans are looking at." [But in the
weeks since]{.underline} Justice Samuel [Alito's]{.underline} majority
[opinion]{.underline} on abortion law [was leaked, there's been no
evidence of a surge in Democratic participation in primaries or early
voting. Not even any real uptick.]{.underline} "I'd be surprised if Roe
v. Wade did not energize the marginal Democratic voter, the sort that
would usually vote in the presidential race but not necessarily in the
midterm, but that only gets you so far," Olsen says. "The real game is
the swing voter." Undoing Obama's Coalition Biden's old boss, Barack
[Obama, put together a winning coalition]{.underline} during his
presidency, combining [college-educated whites with young, Black and
Latino voters]{.underline}. The danger for Democrats is that Biden
appears to be unraveling that coalition. About the only groups still
solidly in his camp are dedicated members of the Democratic base, such
as Black voters and college-educated women. Biden carried close to
two-thirds of [Hispanic voters]{.underline} in 2020, but their [shift
toward Trump, compared to 2016, was notable, especially in states such
as Florida and Texas]{.underline}. In the Texas primaries in March this
year, participation in GOP primaries was up dramatically in heavily
Hispanic portions of South Texas that traditionally have been
overwhelmingly Democratic. An NPR/Marist poll released last month found
that [52 percent of Latinos say they're more likely to support
Republican candidates for Congress; just 39 percent favor
Democrats.]{.underline} Young voters have been a particular problem for
Biden. Voters under 30 favored Biden over Trump, 60 percent to 39
percent, in 2020, but they've soured on him since. [Biden's approval
rating among young voters has dropped by 18 points over the past
year]{.underline}, according to a Harvard Institute of Politics poll --
which is in line with what other pollsters are finding. Even as
Democrats shed support among Latinos, young voters and parents, [the
party's longstanding problem with working-class white voters continues
to worsen]{.underline}. The April NPR/Marist poll found Democrats are
only favored by a third of white voters without college degrees,
compared to [55 percent]{.underline} who [say they are likely to support
Republicans.]{.underline} "The people who are left backing Biden are the
people who would back any Democrat under anything except extreme
circumstances," Olsen says. "That's a terrible place to be in for an
election. You've lost America's middle." Generically Bad [The NPR/Marist
poll asked what is known as a generic ballot question]{.underline} ---
are you more likely to favor a Republican or a Democrat --- rather than
asking about any individual candidates who might be on the ballot.
Candidates do matter. Republicans were notably unhappy that Pennsylvania
voters decided to nominate conspiracy-minded state Sen. Doug Mastriano
for governor last week, viewing him as more likely to lose in November
than other potential picks. Similarly, Republican officials in Missouri
are hoping another candidate can coalesce enough support to stop Eric
Greitens, who resigned as governor in disgrace in 2018 amid multiple
scandals, from winning nomination to the Senate. Republicans left
winnable seats on the table in 2010 and 2012 by nominating
"unacceptable" candidates unable to win in the general election, as
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky himself said last
month. "From an atmospheric point of view, it's a perfect storm of
problems for the Democrats," McConnell said. "How could you screw this
up? It's actually possible. And we've had some experience with that in
the past." McConnell was referring to the 100-seat Senate, which is
currently tied. There are relatively few Democratic seats in play this
year, meaning each race will count enormously. Still, Republicans have
enough opportunities not only to win the majority but come away with a
total of perhaps 53 or 54 seats. The GOP needs only five seats to take
control of the 435-member House. Redistricting has turned out to be more
or less a wash, but on net Republicans gained a slight advantage. A lot
of GOP-tilted seats have been fortified against all but the worst-case
scenarios, while Democrats hold more seats that are marginal. They'll
have little protection in a wave year. There's hardly any
ticket-splitting, with voters favoring candidates of one party or the
other up and down the ballot. There are only 16 seats in the House where
the district voted one way for president in 2020 and the other for
Congress. [The players matter, but sometimes the playing field matters
more. In the most competitive House districts, generic Republicans are
leading generic Democrats by 47 percent to 39 percent.]{.underline}
That's according to internal polling by the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. Even bad candidates can win in the right
environment, which this is shaping up to be for Republicans. "We're
going to have a lot of people winning that no one ever heard of," Carney
says. Messaging and Money The abortion issue may help Democrats
politically in a couple of ways. It could help inspire young voters who
don't like the GOP but aren't Biden stans. It also gives the party
something to talk about. Since the Alito leak, Democrats have been much
more full-throated in support of abortion rights than Republicans have
been about its demise. Democrats would like to think they can easily
convince voters that Republicans can't be trusted since they support the
election lies of a twice-impeached coup leader. But if tying Republicans
to Trump were a winning strategy, it would have paid off for McAuliffe
in Virginia, who certainly tried it. Republicans aren't made of Teflon.
The very term "culture war" suggests there are two sides battling, so
efforts to ban books or restrict the teaching of racial history and
gender identity won't play well with everyone. "The more the party
focused on these culture war issues, I actually believe the less it will
help them in the suburbs," says Brown, the George Washington University
professor. But culture war issues motivate the party's base. And, to
appeal to swing voters, Republicans have plenty of other clubs with
which to beat Biden and the Democrats. Maybe you've already heard this,
but inflation has jumped the most in four decades. Gas prices, already
at a retail average of \$4.60 per gallon, may well go higher with summer
travel demand --- perhaps as high as \$6. Homicides have increased
dramatically since 2019, fueling a return to "tough on crime" rhetoric
among Republicans. It\'s all easy fodder for an opposition party to run
on. Polls indicate that voters trust the GOP more, by significant
margins, when it comes to inflation and the economy in general.
Republicans are enjoying their biggest advantage regarding the crime
issue in decades. All of this is reflected in how partisans are
responding. [The gap between the numbers of Democrats and Republicans
retiring from Congress is the highest it's been in decades]{.underline}.
At the legislative level, Republicans are leaving fewer seats open than
Democrats. Republicans raised \$170 million from January to March
through WinRed, an online fundraising platform. That still lags the
Democrats' ActBlue, which has traditionally been much more robust, but
represents nearly a one-quarter jump for WinRed over the same period in
2020. The Republican Governors Association raised \$33 million in the
first quarter of the year, which was nearly \$10 million more than the
Democratic Governors Association. The Republican State Leadership
Committee brought in just over \$10 million, compared with \$6.5 million
for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. Who Will Turn Out? In
the end, [voter behavior matters most of all]{.underline}. Again, [the
GOP has a big advantage.]{.underline} [A slew of polls have showed large
and indeed growing gaps in terms of levels of enthusiasm]{.underline}
about voting this year between Republicans and Democrats. But we don't
have to rely strictly on polls any more. We're still relatively early in
the primary season, but Republicans are showing up in ways that
Democrats are not. In the first 10 states to hold primaries this year,
Republicans received 61 percent of the total vote, according to an
analysis by GOP pollster John Couvillon. The party generating more
enthusiasm in primaries has fared quite well in the last few midterms.
Democrats received 54 percent of the primary vote in 2018 --- a solid
midterm year for them --- while Republicans got 55 percent in both 2010
and 2014, landslide years for the party. It's true that primary turnout
isn't a perfect measure, since not all races are equally competitive. On
Tuesday, for example, Stacey Abrams was unopposed for the Democratic
nomination for governor of Georgia, while GOP Gov. Brian Kemp faced a
contentious, if ultimately easy, contest against former Sen. David
Perdue. Turnout on the GOP side increased by a half-million votes,
compared to the 2018 primary. But looking at the total picture[, it's
clear more Republicans are turning out. A lot more
Republicans.]{.underline} Overall [Republican primary turnout is up 32
percent, while Democratic turnout has actually declined 3 percent. All
this paints a pretty grim picture for Democrats. They're running behind
on the issues that concern voters most. Their leader is losing support
among key constituencies. Their potential candidates are less likely to
run, while their voters are less likely to turn out.]{.underline} It's
clear that Republicans will be stronger at the end of the year than they
are now. It's not yet possible to say how much stronger, but if anyone
offers to bet you Democrats will retain power in Congress, take their
money. At the state level, GOP victories may not be as momentous, but
that's only because they already hold majorities among governors,
legislators and legislative chambers. **[For Republicans, it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas will fall early this year, on Nov.
8.]{.underline}**

### A2 Win for Biden

#### Russia actually not a win for Biden in the mind of voters

stories. I am especially passionate about covering

Ukraine if Trump were president: poll" The Hill, February 25, 22,
https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/595919-62-percent-of-voters-say-putin-wouldnt-have-invaded-ukraine-if-trump/

A [majority of American voters say that]{.underline} Russian President
[Vladimir Putin would not have invaded Ukraine had]{.underline} former
President [Trump still been in office,]{.underline} according to a new
survey released on Friday. A new Harvard Center for American Political
Studies (CAPS)-Harris Poll survey released Friday found that [**62
percent** of those polled believed Putin would **not be moving against
Ukraine if Trump had been president**]{.underline}. When looking
strictly at the answers of Democrats and Republicans, 85 percent of
Republicans and 38 percent of Democrats answered this way. However, 38
percent of all Americans polled believed that Putin would have invaded
Ukraine even if Trump had been president. Trump's critics contend that
the former president's relationship with Putin was extremely cozy. For
example, Trump publicly called for Russia to be admitted to the G-7 and
has repeatedly criticized Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Biden administration
has staunchly defended the independence of Ukraine. The House twice
impeached Trump, the first time related to his opposition to providing
Ukraine with military aid[. A majority of Americans polled --- **59
percent** --- also said they believed that the Russian president moved
on Ukraine because Putin **saw weakness in President
Biden**]{.underline}, while 41 percent said that it was not a factor in
Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine
late Wednesday, President Biden condemned what he described as an
"unprovoked and unjustified attack" and expressed solidarity with
Ukraine. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Russian financial
institutions, Russian elites and their family members, the Nord Stream 2
AG --- the parent company of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline --- and, the
White House confirmed Friday, Putin himself, among other entities.
However, the U.S. has resisted calls to kick Russia out of the SWIFT
international banking system, despite appeals from Ukrainian officials
and some U.S. lawmakers. The polling comes after Biden has suffered low
approval ratings in recent months. Since taking office, the president
has had to navigate a multitude of issues, including a lingering
COVID-19 pandemic, a chaotic evacuation from Afghanistan, infighting
among Democrats over the administration's legislative agenda and now the
invasion of Ukraine. The Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll survey was conducted
between Feb. 23 and Feb. 24 with 2,026 registered voters. The survey is
an online sample drawn from the Harris Panel and weighted to reflect
known demographics. As a representative online sample, it does not
report a probability confidence interval.

#### No one cares about foreign policy during midterms.

**Cook 22** (Charlie Cook. Cook is an American political analyst for the
Cook Political Report. "Foreign Policy Unlikely to Save Democrats in the
Fall". National journal. February 2022.
https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/foreign-policy-unlikely-save-democrats-fall)

Biden's 41 percent overall approval rating in Gallup was bracketed by a
[[47 percent approval on handling the
coronavirus]{.underline}](https://news.gallup.com/poll/390086/biden-ratings-economy-foreign-affairs-russia-near.aspx),
36 percent on handling "the situation with Russia," 37 percent on the
economy, and 40 percent for foreign policy. Given how monolithic
partisans are in their approval ratings and actual voting, it is always
useful to look only at independents, the 'jump ball' Americans. Biden's
overall rating among them was 35 percent (5 points below his approval
among all adults). His best marks were on dealing with the coronavirus
(45 percent approval), followed by foreign policy (37 percent), Russia
(35 percent), and the economy (30 percent). It is pretty clear the
president and his administration's denial of the threat of inflation and
slow reaction to it was exceedingly damaging to him. (While we are on
the subject, it is fascinating to see Senate Democrats, after so
passionately advocating for more infrastructure spending this past year,
propose suspending the gasoline tax for the rest of the year, no matter
that the gas tax is the primary regular funding source for
transportation infrastructure. Panic is never pretty.) While we don't
know the trajectory that the Russia/Ukraine crisis will take, and there
are [[many factors that can impact on midterm
elections]{.underline}](https://www.vox.com/22899204/midterm-elections-president-biden-thermostatic-opinion),
we do know that [in the absence of a large number of U.S. military
deaths, **Americans rarely vote on foreign-policy issues, particularly
in midterms**. The state and direction of the economy, particularly
[change in real disposable personal
income](https://www.mischiefsoffaction.com/post/2022-midterm-forecast),
is far more determinative.]{.underline} Turnout and the relative levels
of enthusiasm between the two parties' bases is key. There was a big gap
heading into the 2018 midterm elections with, as usual, the party out of
power much more motivated going into the fall of that year---though the
Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination did a lot to close the gap in
predominantly rural areas, which helped Republicans actually score a net
gain in the Senate while getting hosed (a political science term) in the
House. Right now, Democrats are the party suffering from a lack of
motivation among their base. [If someone wanting a read on a midterm is
only going to watch two things, it should be a **president's approval
rating** and the [**generic congressional ballot
test**](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/forecasting-the-2022-midterm-election-with-the-generic-ballot/),]{.underline}
both pretty good barometers of which way the wind is blowing and whether
it's light, moderate, or heavy.

"Memo: Dems Need To Focus On Winning The Economic Argument," January 27,
22, https://www.ndn.org/memo-dems-need-focus-winning-economic-argument

Winning The Economic Argument -- This week we hosted noted economist Rob
Shapiro for a terrific discussion of his two recent essays in the
Washington Monthly, It's A Biden Boom -- And No One Has Noticed Yet and
The Biden Boom Is Bigger Than We Thought. You can watch it here. The two
essays make clear that 2021 was a banner year for the American economy,
one of the best in the post WWII era -- 6m jobs, 5+% GDP growth, record
new business formations, real wage gains for the bottom 50% of workers,
5m people gaining health insurance, booming housing and stock markets.
[There can be no doubt that the **vast majority** of Americans are
**better off today than they were a year ago**]{.underline}, and given
the daily adversity we all faced due to COVID, we need to tip our hats
to the resilience, ingenuity and can do spirit of the American people.
The question of why the electorate doesn't understand that the economy
is better, and why Americans give Republicans a big advantage on the
economy right now when their recent track while in office is among the
worst in American history (3 consecutive recessions) are among the most
important questions in American politics today. [It is very hard to see
how Democrats are competitive in the elections this fall without doing
something significant to change voter's basic understanding of how just
much better the economy is today, and how much better the economy has
been with Democrats in power over the past 30 plus years]{.underline}
(40m of the 42m jobs created since 1989 have been created under
Democratic Presidents). [As a matter of politics, changing this
understanding should be the singular mission of the Democratic Party in
2022]{.underline}. There are many forms a big campaign like this could
take, but there are two pieces which Democrats should consider right
away: The DNC Leads A Big Conversation About How With Democrats Things
Get Better -- The DNC should take on this mission, and organize a
yearlong education effort involving every element of the party across
the country. Power points, videos, fact sheets, web sites should be
developed, and every state and local party have to make it be their goal
to be loud and proud about the achievements of Joe Biden and the
Democrats more broadly this year. Language and arguments should be
tested, workshopped. A large multimedia ad campaign should be developed
to support the free media effort, and it should run in the second
quarter of this year, from mid-April to July 4th. Every Democrat should
be asked to contribute to this vital effort, and a target goal of \$50m
should be established. Voters need to know this information now, not in
the fall -- that is when candidates have to do their job. Other elements
of the center-left family with resources can amplify the effort[. At a
strategy level the goal should be to **get the Democrats even or ahead
with Republicans on the economy**]{.underline} by Labor Day[, making it
far more likely the election will be competitive this fall.]{.underline}
A campaign like this also has the benefit of bringing the party back
together around a singular mission, something we think the party can use
right now. Elected Officials Do Months of Events Showing How Much Better
Things Are -- In research NDN did in late 2010 and early 2011, we asked
voters who did they need to hear from to know a recovery was taking
place. The clear answer was local business people. Voters told us that
if they heard it from a brewery which had hired a few more people, or a
factory that was going to two shifts, then they would believe a recovery
was taking place. That work informed the work of the Obama White House,
and Senate and House Democrats over the next few years as we struggled
to help people understand a recovery was indeed taking place. Today's
elected Democrats should tear some pages from this playbook, and spend
most of their public events in state or district in the coming months
with local business people who can validate that things are better.
These local leaders could also become stars in campaign ads and videos.
The efforts to play up the Infrastructure Bill should be seen as part of
this effort, and not stand alone; for there are limits to how much
political benefit Democrats will get from things people will not see or
feel before November. As the incumbent party, Democrats will be judged
this fall largely on whether voters think we've done a good job, that
things are better. Things are better, and we should spend the next 10
months relentlessly making the case that they are. Every moment we spend
talking about things which will not be felt by the election should be
understood now as a distraction[. We have a vital argument to win this
year; one we can win; and one we must win to make the elections
competitive this fall.]{.underline} And we need to keep repeating -- if
we can't get credit for what we've done, it's unlikely we are going to
get credit for things which haven't happened yet. Things are better[.
With Democrats things are better. Things are better today than they were
a year ago.]{.underline} Let's get to work people. Final note -- we are
not as convinced as others that inflation is the central reason
[Democrats have struggled to break through on the economy this
year.]{.underline} For more on that see here. We believe the central
reason we haven't broken through is that we haven't tried hard enough.
That's a fixable thing, and what this plan tries to address. Does this
plan assume the economy stays strong in 2022, and we can keep making the
argument? Yep[. It is the likely scenario and we should go for
it.]{.underline}

### A2 NATO

#### Republicans support NATO expansion, Finland and Sweden will help share the load with military. 

**Zengerle '22** (Patricia Zengerle is a Correspondent for Congress and
National Security in the Thomson Reuters, "U.S. Republicans Join

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic and Republican U.S. Senate leaders
introduced a resolution on Monday backing Sweden and Finland\'s bids to
join NATO, underscoring support for expanding the alliance despite
growing nationalism in the Republican party[.]{.underline} It will take
a two-thirds majority in the 100-member Senate to approve the expansion
of the alliance, requiring \"yes\" votes from at least 17 Republicans
along with every Democrat. [Many U.S. Republicans]{.underline} have been
following the lead of former President Donald Trump - the party\'s
leader - toward [more nationalist foreign policy]{.underline}. [Trump
accused **NATO allies** of **not spending enough on their own defense**
and excessively **burdening** **the U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}.
Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine has prompted Finland and Sweden to apply
to join NATO. In the Senate, [11 Republicans voted \"no\" last week
against legislation providing \$40 billion to help Ukraine]{.underline},
with some saying they wanted the funds director to Americans. Last
month, [63 Republican members of the House]{.underline} of
Representatives, nearly one-third of the full caucus, [opposed a bill
reaffirming U.S. support for NATO.]{.underline} The top Senate
Republican, Mitch McConnell, and Jim Risch, the top Republican on the
foreign relations panel, joined Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer and committee chairman Bob Menendez and other senators in
introducing the resolution. \"We fully support their application to
become NATO members and are looking forward to their swift ascension in
the coming months,\" Menendez said in a statement. McConnell referred to
[**Finland and Sweden** as \"strong countries with formidable military
capabilities\"]{.underline} and said in his statement, [\"both nations\'
robust defense funding means their accession **would** meaningfully
**bolster our pursuit of greater burden-sharing across the
alliance**.]{.underline} I fully support the Senate providing its advice
and consent as quickly as possible.\" (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle;

[**Republican** U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul]{.underline} of Austin is the
top House Republican on foreign affairs and [voted to **support
NATO**]{.underline}. On Wednesday, [he sported a blue-and-gold Ukrainian
ribbon]{.underline} on his suit jacket at the Capitol. He
[told]{.underline} The Texas Tribune that [**NATO countries are
"stepping up**" in ways some countries had **lagged
before**.]{.underline} A frequent conservative critique of NATO is that
many European countries fall short of the expected standard that all
member countries spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense. ["NATO is
more unified than it's ever been. Germany]{.underline} now is putting in
2% of their GDP. And they [are sending weapons and they are
training,"]{.underline} he said. NATO bonds further frayed in recent
years, as Trump regularly railed against the alliance. But his criticism
did lead to [several NATO countries]{.underline} deciding to [increase
their **defense spending**.]{.underline} Everything changed six weeks
ago when Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, a country on
the Eastern European frontier that long aspired to join the
organization. Several NATO countries located near Ukraine, like Poland,
are most impacted by the refugee exodus from Ukraine. At the heart of
NATO is an agreement among all 30 countries known as Article 5, which
states an attack on one NATO member country is an attack on all NATO
allies. The 9/11 attacks on the United States are the single time in the
alliance's existence that Article 5 has been invoked. Former NATO
Ambassador Kay Bailey Hutchison addressed the vote in an interview with
the Tribune on Wednesday. Hutchison carefully noted she had not read the
language in the House resolution but insisted the political
establishment is behind NATO. ["I know we have **bipartisan support for
NATO**]{.underline} --- I know that," she told Tribune CEO Evan Smith,
pointing to her former colleagues in the U.S. Senate. "We have that
bipartisan support," she later added. "I've seen it[." **U.S. Rep**.
Colin Allred]{.underline}, a Dallas Democrat who serves on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, seemed mystified that so many Texans voted
against a resolution supporting **[NATO]{.underline}**, noting that the
last two Republican presidents prior to Trump --- George H.W. Bush and
George W. Bush --- were NATO boosters. "I really don't know what to make
of it," he said. ["We've seen how **important** it is, and I find it
really hard to understand."]{.underline}

### Election interference

#### Foreign interference won't affect outcomes---no external internet accessibility and too many built in redundancies.

SW 9-14-2016

A month after 20,000 private emails from the Democratic National
Committee were published online, election officials across the country
received a series of warnings from the FBI: Hackers were targeting
states' election websites and, in at least one case, were able to steal
voter registration data. The Department of Homeland Security has since
created an election cybersecurity action campaign, and US intelligence
officials have begun investigating the possibility of a covert Russian
intelligence operation that seeks to undermine the integrity of the
American election.

But [despite the growing concerns over foreign meddling coming from
Congress, intelligence experts, and the Clinton campaign, state election
officials say **American voters have little to fear.**]{.underline}

["There are over 9,000 jurisdictions that operate elections at a very
local level, so that's both a blessing and a curse,"]{.underline} Denise
Merrill, Connecticut's secretary of state and president of the National
Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), a nonpartisan organization
that represents the country's top state election officials, told
BuzzFeed News. ["It really saves us from worrying too much about
cybersecurity --- we have other concerns, but that's kind of not one of
them."]{.underline}

Merrill was appointed by NASS to join Homeland Security's special
working group on election cybersecurity. The group's goal is to build
closer ties between the federal government and local election officials,
and also to consider designating state voting systems as "critical
infrastructure," akin to dams and power grids, granting election offices
additional resources and protections from the federal government.

Merrill, along with the secretaries of state and election officials
representing California, Florida, Ohio, Minnesota, Colorado, and Iowa,
told BuzzFeed News that [pre--Election Day simulations, paper trail
audits, and the fact that voting machines are not connected to the web
provide strong safeguards to the electoral system.]{.underline}

State election officials emphasized that [the recent hack into voter
registration databases differs from the risks faced by their offices,
because these databases aren't directly tied to voting on Election Day
and because voting machines cannot be accessed remotely through the
internet.]{.underline} "That's [the voter registration
system]{.underline}, which [is not at all connected to the actual
voting]{.underline}," Merrill said, adding [that in almost every state,
voter registration is completed on paper. "There are backup paper
systems for every process in our election, and that means cybersecurity
is not the concern that it's being portrayed to be
nationally."]{.underline}

An overwhelming majority of the American public believes that artificial

three case studies in this brief show, [the public does not agree on the
proper regulation of AI applications]{.underline}. Indeed,
population-level support of an AI application may belie opposition by
some subpopulations. Many AI applications, such as facial recognition
technology, could cause disparate harm to already vulnerable subgroups,
particularly ethnic minorities and low-income individuals. In addition,
partisan divisions are likely to prevent government regulation of AI
applications that could be used to influence electoral politics. [In
particular, the regulation of content recommendation algorithms used by
social media platforms has been highly contestable]{.underline}.
Finally, [mobilizing an influential group of political actors, such as
machine learning researchers in the campaign against lethal autonomous
weapons, may be more effective in shifting policy debates than
mobilizing the public at large. Algorithms used to recommend content on
social media have increasingly come under scrutiny]{.underline}.
Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube use machine learning to
suggest media content and advertisements that optimize for user
engagement. [Civil society groups and researchers have expressed
concerns that these algorithms help spread misinformation]{.underline},
proliferate digital propaganda, create partisan echo chambers, and
promote violent extremism. Unlike facial recognition technology that
could more readily be managed at the local or state level, social media
platforms have users across the U.S. and around the world. California
has sought to regulate online bots and protect consumer privacy, setting
the terms of the debate for federal regulations. However, it remains to
be seen if the federal government will follow the way of California or
oppose the state's policies. In the U.S., legislation to regulate social
media platforms has stalled because of the divergent policy priorities
of the two parties. [In light of Russian intervention in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Congress has
held several hearings to investigate and castigate tech
companies]{.underline}. The techlash from the left and the right are
different: Democrats prioritize the prevention of digital manipulation
and consumer privacy while [Republicans focus on alleged bias against
conservatives]{.underline}. Democratic senators have introduced
legislation that would increase transparency for online campaign
advertisements and require tech companies to safeguard users' sensitive
data[. Republican lawmakers have accused social media platforms of
censoring conservative viewpoints]{.underline}, despite evidence to the
contrary. The Trump White House is reportedly drafting an executive
order to combat this alleged bias. The American public is concerned
about the lack of accountability by tech companies that operate social
media platforms, but does not agree on policy solutions. According to a
report from the Pew Research Center, 51% of the U.S. public thinks that
tech companies should be regulated more than they are now. At the same
time, Americans indicate that they have greater trust in tech companies
than the U.S. federal government to manage the development and use of AI
in the best interests of the public, per data from the Center for the
Governance of AI. The public is evenly split on whether there should be
regulation of content recommendation algorithms based on political
affiliations or political viewpoints, according to a 2017 Harvard/Harris
Poll survey. The partisan division among lawmakers in Congress is also
reflected in public opinion. There exists a stark asymmetry in how
Republicans and Democrats perceive bias in social media platforms and
tech companies. While [54% of Republicans think it is very likely that
social media platforms censor political viewpoints]{.underline}, only
20% of Democrats do, according to a survey from the Pew Research Center.
Conversely, while 53% of Democrats think major tech companies support
the views of liberals and conservatives equally, only 28% of Republicans
feel the same way. With political gridlock hindering governmental
regulation of algorithms used by social media platforms, tech companies
have tried to answer their critics through industry self-regulation.
Nevertheless, industry self-regulation is not immune to underlying
conflicts in American politics. For instance, Google's AI ethics board
dissolved after the company's employees and outside civil society groups
protested the inclusion of Heritage Foundation president Kay Coles James
and drone company CEO Dyan Gibbens on the board.
