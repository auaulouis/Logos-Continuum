# Unilat/NATO Withdrawal CP

### Notes

# Top

### General \-\-- 1NC

#### The United States federal government should send a notice of denunciation to all member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that the United States is formally withdrawing from NATO.

#### The United States federal government should immediately cease all joint-operations with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 

#### European NATO members are hyper-reliant upon American funding -- withdrawal incentivizes European led funding and leadership.

The reason the [Europeans]{.underline} don't do so is because they don't
want to and don't have to. Some [don't believe that Moscow actually
**poses much of a threat**]{.underline}. Others figure only the nations
bordering Russia face any risk, and there's little interest in "Old
Europe" for confronting Moscow over "New Europe." And almost everyone
[assumes America will **take care of any problems**]{.underline}.

[Particularly striking is the **lack of military effort**]{.underline}
from those supposedly threatened by the supposed new Hitler to the east.
[This year NATO‐​Europe came in at **1.5 percent of GDP**]{.underline},
**[well short]{.underline}** [of the two percent objective]{.underline}.
Only Estonia, Greece (mostly to confront Turkey), Poland (first time
ever), and the United Kingdom made that level. Notably [missing are
France, Germany, and Italy]{.underline} (the continent's other major
powers), [Latvia and Lithuania]{.underline} (squealing loudly about
Russian threats), [and Turkey]{.underline} (challenging Russia over
parochial rather than alliance interests).

[Over the years American officials have pleaded]{.underline}, cajoled,
contended, [and begged the **Europeans to do more**]{.underline}. Even
during the Cold War such efforts failed to yield much fruit. They have
even less chance of working in the future. Reported Jan Techau of
Carnegie Europe: "[the **dependence of European NATO allies** on the
**U**nited **S**tates has further **increased** since the end of the
Cold War]{.underline}, not decreased." Indeed, he added, "while
[European membership in NATO has nearly doubled since 1990]{.underline},
**[defense spending]{.underline}** by Europeans **[has gone down by 28
percent]{.underline}** since then."

First, the U.S. insists that it will never leave. [So long as it
frenetically "reassures" allies]{.underline}, [trying to convince them
that Americans are worthy to subsidize Europe]{.underline}, [the latter
will respond by **not doing much**]{.underline}. Second, Russia doesn't
threaten America or most of Europe. The latter have little incentive to
spend more. Third, domestic economic concerns remain paramount
throughout the continent. There are few votes to be gained from
supporting greater military expenditures to meet a phantom threat
because it would gladden hearts in Washington, Vilnius, and Kiev.

The United States should do in 2016 what it failed to do in 1990. It
should announce that the world has changed since creation of a
U.S.-dominated NATO. [It is time to **refashion the alliance** for a
world]{.underline} in which allies had prospered and enemies had
disappeared. [One possibility for the future would be a **European‐​run
NATO**]{.underline}, [with America perhaps as an associate]{.underline}
member. [Another alternative would be a **continental defense** run
alongside the **E**uropean **U**nion]{.underline}. Maybe there's
something else.

[But the **time for subsidizing**]{.underline}, coddling and reassuring
the Europeans **[is over]{.underline}**. American taxpayers deserve as
much consideration as European ones. [U.S. military forces shouldn't be
deployed to advance interests of greatest concern to other
nations]{.underline}. Any future alliances forged by Washington should
act as serious military pacts, not international social clubs.

### Decrease Security Cooperation \-\-- 1NC

#### The United States federal government should gradually decrease its security investments within NATO countries and threaten to leave the alliance if all member countries do not reach the 2% GDP goal.

#### Threats and decreased economic investment in NATO spur ally investments and follow-on -- solves best.

[Policymakers have to **balance** **the** **U**nited **S**tates'
**relationship with** its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (**NATO**)
allies]{.underline}. If the United States gets too comfortable with
allied relations, allies will feel more secure relying on US security
guarantees. [The tenser the relationship]{.underline} between them, [the
more NATO allies will **pay in defense**]{.underline} as US guarantees
are brought into question and could, in turn, invite Russian
adventurism. While [the Trump administration's pressure on NATO
allies]{.underline} has **[increased their defense
spending]{.underline}**, policymakers must weigh that short-term gain
with the long-term effects of a waning US commitment to NATO.

On July 29, 2020, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper announced the
withdrawal of 11,900 US military personnel from Germany. This plan
proposed to send roughly half of those troops back to the United States,
while the rest would be redistributed around Europe. Secretary Esper
explained that the troop movements were part of a broader military
reorganization, but President Trump countered that claim by linking the
reason for the withdrawal of troops to Germany's "delinquent" payments
to NATO. He noted that Germany had yet to meet the 2014 Wales Pledge to
spend two percent of its GDP on defense. [The Trump
administration]{.underline} has [**used** this **troop withdrawal** to
pressure US allies]{.underline} to contribute more to the alliance or
face the prospect of declining US commitments to Europe. While the Trump
administration's [pressure will increase defense spending among European
allies who fear a complete US withdrawal]{.underline}, it will also
degrade the deterrence offered by the United States' security
obligations to the alliance.

The Trump administration has threatened [NATO allies to the point that
they fear the **U**nited **S**tates **may withdraw** from the
organization or not fulfill its obligations to Article V unless the
allies meet the objective of **spending two percent of their GDP on
defense**]{.underline}. Past administrations have called for NATO allies
to contribute more to the alliance for decades. However, they have never
called into question the US commitment to Europe. Yet, [this pressure
has forced the European allies to start taking **greater ownership of
their security**]{.underline} at the cost of warm relations with the
United States as seen through allied leader's statements.

[In order to pressure allies]{.underline}, [**the** **U**nited
**S**tates **has to send costly signals**]{.underline}, **[such as
withdrawing troops from Europe]{.underline}**, to demonstrate that their
security interests have diverged. [This political pressure acts as a
forceful method to motivate NATO allies to do more because it provides a
credible threat of exclusion]{.underline} [from the
benefits]{.underline} **[of US protection]{.underline}**. Within NATO,
only the United States maintains and controls the conventional and
nuclear capacity to deter and defend against existential threats to the
alliance. No other ally has the expeditionary military capacity to do
so. For example, Estonia is not worried about being abandoned by
Romania, Portugal, or even Germany, knowing none of them could bring a
sizable military force to bear in response to a Russian invasion or fait
accompli. In this case, Estonia's chief concern revolves around the
United States' guarantee of their sovereignty through NATO. [Suppose
**the** **U**nited **S**tates **can make credible claims** that it is
willing to abandon an ally]{.underline} and not fulfill its treaty
obligations. In that case, [the ally will experience a **drastic
incentive** to **increase its military capabilities** to defend
itself.]{.underline}

It may seem that these tensions and fears will only lead to negative
outcomes, but [some disunity within an alliance can **yield positive
results**]{.underline}. Several articles researching the implications of
free-riding and burdening-sharing in alliances have supported this
notion. In Olson and Zeckhauser's seminal article on burden-sharing,
they wrote, "This fact leads to the paradoxical conclusion that a
decline in the amity, unity, and community of interest among allies need
not necessarily reduce the effectiveness of an alliance..." and "The
United States, at least, should perhaps not hope for too much unity in
common ventures with other nations. It might prove extremely expensive."
Similarly, Plumper and Neumayer note in reference to the smaller allies
(non-US allies), "Unless the interests of alliance members are
independent, the existence of NATO allows the smaller allies to
free-ride to some extent."

Moreover, the breakdown of unity in the alliance caused by the Trump
administration demands has compelled European allies to take a larger
role in their defense. The former German Ambassador to the United
States, Peter Wittig, described the Trump administration's approach as a
"healthy wakeup call for the Europeans...to not free-ride." [Currently,
**the leaders of NATO member-states** feel they **cannot rely on**
**the** **U**nited **S**tates **as the sole guarantor** of Europe's
security.]{.underline} Back in 2017, German Chancellor Angela Merkel
stated, "We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands"
and, "We can't rely on the superpower of the United States." A year
later, French President Emmanuel [Macron reinforced this sentiment
declaring, "It is up to us today to take our responsibilities and
guarantee our own security]{.underline}, **[and thus have European
sovereignty]{.underline}**." More recently, in response to the planned
troop withdrawal announced this past summer, the German Defense Minister
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer called the move "regrettable" and noted,
"[The truth is that a good life in Germany and Europe depends more and
more on how we ensure our security ourselves]{.underline}."

These responses from European leaders show that startling allies into
thinking the United States will abandon them has influenced allies to
increase defense spending in line with the 2014 Wales Pledge. However,
in the long term, NATO policymaking should employ a balanced approach.
If the United States brings its security guarantee of the alliance too
much into question, Russia or other states may take action to test the
United States' resolve. During the Cold War, [US leaders continually
reaffirmed their commitment to allies, effectively deterring a Soviet
invasion. **Deterrence works best** when **allies clearly express their
mutual obligations** to all actors on the international
stage.]{.underline}

The experience of the United Kingdom and Germany leading up to World War
I provides an example of how the United Kingdom's lack of a solid
commitment to its allies allowed German leaders to think the British
would stand aside in the war. Barbara Tuchman details this situation in
her book The Guns of August. The failure of King George V and the UK
Foreign Secretary to give a definite guarantee of joining the war should
Germany invade allowed the Kaiser to think that he could attack without
a British intervention. If the British had made a direct declaration of
support for its allies, German leadership might have decided against
escalating the war. This case gives policymakers an idea of what could
happen if the United States does not maintain a firm commitment to its
NATO allies. US leaders must watch how far they allow the US commitment
to NATO wane in competitors' eyes or risk possible adventurism on the
eastern flank of NATO.

What do these two conflicting options mean for US policymakers? If the
United States wants allies to meet the defense spending requirements, it
needs them to fear the possibility that the United States may abandon
them because their interests no longer align. The allies will only fear
abandonment if the United States sends costly signals to them, such as
troop withdrawals. As of 2020, the majority of allies that meet the
elusive two percent spending goal sit on NATO's eastern flank, fearing
Russia and desiring US protection. Nevertheless, spending across the
alliance has increased since 2014, in part, due to the Trump
administration's application of political pressure calling into doubt US
interests in Europe. However, in the medium- and long-term,
[**threatening to abandon** **allies will decrease the appearance of US
security guarantees** and invite competitors to push
boundaries.]{.underline}

Policymakers must balance the coercion needed to increase contributions
of European allies by making them question US intentions, but not
distance the United States to the point that it jeopardizes the alliance
or the deterrence that the US military power provides. A snapshot of one
such policy could involve pulling a significant number of permanently
stationed US forces from Europe, while reassuring US commitments to its
allies through rotational deployments (not of equal number to the
withdrawal) in support of NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence and other
operations. This concept aims to incentivize allies to build up military
strength for initial deterrence and defense on the continent with the
backing of US security guarantees, but lacking the tangible comfort
drawn from a large permanent US force presence. With the probability
that the incoming Biden administration will quickly mend relations in
Europe, it runs the risk of reversing the current trend of increasing
defense spending across the alliance and fostering free-riding. The
United States should not go running back into the arms of the Europeans.
Rather, it should [**maintain blunt political pressure** on the
Europeans]{.underline} to do more while ensuring its commitment to its
allies remains clear to NATO's potential adversaries.

North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}, and thus the country in question
ceases to be a member of NATO. The formal process of doing this process
is stated in article XIII of the Treaty. This says that [any country

the U.S. would then pass on to the other countries in the

[If **U.S. President**]{.underline} Donald Trump [decides to withdraw
from NATO tomorrow]{.underline}, **[Congress might be unable to stop
him.]{.underline}**

That's the conclusion a group of top lawmakers and some legal experts
have reached, as Trump over the past two years has repeatedly bashed the
alliance and extended olive branches to Russian President Vladimir
Putin---even while his administration has taken some steps to support
NATO.

The legal assessment is particularly worrying for some Democratic
lawmakers in the wake of a New York Times report revealing that Trump
had privately discussed leaving NATO. And it reflects a broader
challenge that the Trump presidency poses on a number of issues,
including trade policy, international treaties, and clean governance:
The guardrails that curb a president's powers are often traditions and
norms but not actual laws.

U.S. membership in NATO retains broad public support and nearly
unanimous backing in an otherwise fractious Congress. And any attempt to
alter America's role in the alliance would push the president into
uncharted legal waters, even setting aside the geopolitical shockwaves.

Still, if Trump decided to withdraw unilaterally, it appears **[the law
would be on his side]{.underline}**, [based on a series of court rulings
over the past half-century and the Constitution itself.]{.underline}

"[The president, in the foreign affairs realm, can exercise a lot of
discretion]{.underline} where Congress is silent," said Scott Anderson,
a scholar at the Brookings Institution and former attorney for the State
Department who has explored the issue in his research.

[Anderson pointed to a case involving China and Taiwan in the 1970s.
Sen. Barry Goldwater and other lawmakers in 1979 sued President Jimmy
Carter after he unilaterally withdrew from a mutual defense treaty with
Taiwan to pave the way for the "One China" policy.]{.underline} [The
Supreme Court **dismissed the lawmakers' challenge**]{.underline},
[saying foreign affairs issues were **political** ones, **not
judicial**]{.underline}, and this was a fight for Congress and the
executive branch to sort out among themselves.

[Judges **avoided intervening in subsequent cases** as
well]{.underline}. In 1986, a private company doing business in
Nicaragua, Beacon Products Corp., sued the Reagan administration for
damages after it slapped a trade embargo on the Central American country
and withdrew from a joint treaty of friendship. The suit was dismissed
in a U.S. district court.

And in 2002, 32 members of Congress sued George W. Bush for withdrawing
from the Cold War-era Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed with the
Soviet Union without prior congressional consent. That case was thrown
out of a U.S. district court. The judge cited the Goldwater v. Carter
precedent, saying the treaty withdrawal was a political issue and thus
outside the scope of the judicial branch.

With that in mind, [a]{.underline} bipartisan [group of senators who
support NATO drafted legislation last year that would bar the president
from leaving]{.underline} NATO without two-thirds consent of the
senate---the same ratio required for the United States to enter into any
new treaty as directed by the Constitution. Ultimately, **[the Senate
didn't vote on the bill.]{.underline}**

Suggesting that [NATO should be **transformed into a European alliance**
for securing Europe]{.underline} implies that it can do so, of course.
There is a scholarly debate on the subject, but the fact that there is
even discussion of whether Europe --- with an economy more than nine
times larger than Russia's and three and a half times the Russian
population --- can defend itself against Russia speaks volumes on the
extent to which the United States has infantilized Europe. [European
states]{.underline} --- and the European Union --- [have made defense
decisions from behind Captain America's shield. **Remove the shield**,
and **you will likely get different decisions**.]{.underline}

Europe Without the United States: Back to the Future?

Making any policy judgment involves uncertainty and counterfactuals, but
skeptics about European autonomy should make perfectly clear: Which
security scenario does American dominance of European defense really
foreclose? German territorial expansionism? The parlous state of the
German military and the nuclear arsenals of France and the United
Kingdom would seem to preclude the possibility. A Russian conquest of
Germany? The idea seems similarly fanciful and carries immensely high
risks and dubious payoffs for a Putin government that seems clearly
oriented to power realities. A unified Europe that establishes a bloc
from which the United States would be excluded? To what end? Even
engaging with these arguments feels like burning straw men. There just
isn't much menacing the continent's major powers. And if nothing menaces
its major powers, there isn't much at stake for U.S. national security.

If we remember Lord Hastings Lionel Ismay --- NATO's first
secretary-general --- and his well-known remark that NATO's founding
mission was to keep the Soviet Union out, the United States in, and
Germany down, American immovability begins to make more sense. The
United States has doggedly opposed the creation of a third force in
Europe, whether German, European, or otherwise. The question becomes: If
there is no need to keep Germany --- or European defense cooperation ---
down, what need is there to keep the United States in? Particularly in
an era of scarce resources and growing needs elsewhere?

Last December, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley
suggested there should be a "holistic review of the disposition of the
force and the tasking purposes of all of the forces worldwide. There's a
very strong argument to be made that we may have forces in places that
they shouldn't be." In February, the Biden administration took up this
task, announcing a global posture review. As it concludes that report,
the Pentagon will likely come to the unhappy conclusion that freeing up
resources for competition with China entails giving up big-ticket items
elsewhere.

Looking Ahead

[America's self-appointed roles as **European pacifier**]{.underline},
Middle East policeman, and Asian great-power competitor [are becoming
too heavy to carry]{.underline} at the same time. Strategy is about
choice. The unipolar era allowed the United States largely to avoid
choice for decades, but [U.S. defense budgets are flattening and the
**pressures of international politics are reemerging**]{.underline}.
[The easiest place to **divest American burdens** should be
Europe]{.underline}. The question for policymakers is whether they
[start a gradual process of **replacing American leadership with
European leadership**]{.underline}, or whether they will wait until a
crisis occurs, when airy assumptions and lax planning collapse under
strain. A number of scholars argued for handing Europe off to the
Europeans in the 1990s. [The intervening years should have made clear
that Europe's wholeness and freedom **do not require U.S. boots** on the
ground]{.underline}. Europe's major powers are unlikely to attack one
another and can defend themselves against Russia. [The United States
should be a friend to Europe, not its pacifier]{.underline}.

Fourth, [the deficiencies are woefully, **ostentatiously
outrageous**]{.underline}. [They would be comical if the burden of such
shortcomings was not ultimately borne by America]{.underline}. Last year
the Atlantic Council's Jorge [Benitez called the German military's
readiness **"abysmal."**]{.underline} [The **Bundestag Military
Commissioner**]{.underline}, Hans‐​Peter Bartels, [concluded that "There
is **neither enough personnel nor materiel**, and often one confronts
shortage upon shortage."]{.underline}

[Analysts cited inadequate numbers or availability of aircraft,
helicopters, ships, and submarines.]{.underline} The military lacked
sufficient recruits, winter clothing, radios, and spare parts. Defense &
Security Monitor warned that: ["These conditions render German
contributions to security missions under an EU- or NATO‐​led mandate
**less than optimal**]{.underline}, as its [troop
deployments]{.underline} **[lack proper logistical
support]{.underline}** and effective firepower capability."

[That Berlin fails to adequately provide for its force is properly its
decision, not that of America. As long as Germany does not expect
Washington to meet Germany's defense needs if something goes
wrong.]{.underline} Richard Grenell, the US ambassador to Berlin
recently returned to America, made the same point in a slightly
different fashion: ["It is actually offensive to assume that the US
taxpayer must continue to pay to have 50,000-plus Americans in Germany,
but the Germans get to spend their surplus on domestic
programs."]{.underline}

[Grenell would have Berlin spend more]{.underline}. [The better approach
would be for]{.underline} **[Washington to return
responsibility]{.underline}** [for Germany's defense]{.underline} **[to
Germany]{.underline}**. [Tensions in the relationship would ease
dramatically if the US did not constantly browbeat its allies to do what
American policymakers believe would be best]{.underline}. Instead,
**[Washington should announce what it plans to do]{.underline}**, and
let friendly states plan accordingly. Which would make the president's
decision a positive one.

German policymakers finally might be learning an important lesson from
Trump. Bundestag member and ruling party spokesman on international
affairs Johann David Wadephul said: ["It's yet another wake‐​up call for
us Europeans to **take our fate into our own hands."**]{.underline}

[When looking at [NATO's **short-term viability**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[the picture [is]{.mark} far [less positive without the]{.mark}
substantial commitment of the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. The most obvious item of concern if
the US were to leave or moderate its commitment to NATO in the short
term would be sheer manpower. In 2016, the alliance had a combined troop
strength of around 3.1 million [active duty
[personnel]{.mark}]{.underline}. Without the United States, that
immediately [[drops by]{.mark} nearly **[half]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
somewhere below 1.9 million personnel.\[vi\] This ignores [[thousands
of]{.mark} pieces of military [equipment]{.mark} that would [no longer
support]{.mark} NATO]{.underline}, including armored vehicles, aircraft,
and ships. Granted, Russia---the most prominent threat to NATO---has
significantly cut down its active duty forces in recent years, estimated
at just over 900,000 active duty personnel in 2016.\[vii\] However, the
exact number of reservists Russia has at its disposal is unknown, and
could be anywhere from 2 to 20 million personnel depending on the scale
of a call up.\[viii\] While NATO forces may have an advantage in
training, equipment, and organization, past a certain point quantity
surpasses quality. Russia has also been increasing efforts to update its
military arsenal, purchasing new weapons and equipment to close that gap
as well.\[ix\]

The more important question, however, may be who would assume [the
burden of leadership for the alliance in the absence of the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}. [Among the most influential of NATO's
members]{.underline}, [[there is no]{.mark} obvious [candidate to take
the lead]{.mark}]{.underline} if the United States were to step aside,
and all the obvious candidates face their own significant political
issues at home and abroad. [[The **U**]{.mark}nited
**[K]{.mark}**ingdom**['s]{.mark}** [relationship with]{.mark}
continental [Europe has been strained]{.mark} in the aftermath of its
vote to leave the EU.]{.underline} Its relationship will be further
tested in the months and years to come as that process plays out.\[x\]
Germany's President-elect, former Foreign Minister Frank-Walter
Steinmeier, has broken with Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing
coalition with a more conciliatory tone towards Russia. He has
criticized NATO policies on sanctions and military exercises.\[xi\]
Meanwhile, [[France remains in]{.mark} a [constant state of]{.mark} high
[alert]{.mark}]{.underline} following a string of terrorist attacks over
the past several years---a threat it is not alone in facing---with new
plots being uncovered and thwarted in February and troops remaining
deployed on the streets.\[xii\]

[When looking at [NATO's **short-term viability**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[the picture [is]{.mark} far [less positive without the]{.mark}
substantial commitment of the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. The most obvious item of concern if
the US were to leave or moderate its commitment to NATO in the short
term would be sheer manpower. In 2016, the alliance had a combined troop
strength of around 3.1 million [active duty
[personnel]{.mark}]{.underline}. Without the United States, that
immediately [[drops by]{.mark} nearly **[half]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
somewhere below 1.9 million personnel.\[vi\] This ignores [[thousands
of]{.mark} pieces of military [equipment]{.mark} that would [no longer
support]{.mark} NATO]{.underline}, including armored vehicles, aircraft,
and ships. Granted, Russia---the most prominent threat to NATO---has
significantly cut down its active duty forces in recent years, estimated
at just over 900,000 active duty personnel in 2016.\[vii\] However, the
exact number of reservists Russia has at its disposal is unknown, and
could be anywhere from 2 to 20 million personnel depending on the scale
of a call up.\[viii\] While NATO forces may have an advantage in
training, equipment, and organization, past a certain point quantity
surpasses quality. Russia has also been increasing efforts to update its
military arsenal, purchasing new weapons and equipment to close that gap
as well.\[ix\]

The more important question, however, may be who would assume [the
burden of leadership for the alliance in the absence of the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}. [Among the most influential of NATO's
members]{.underline}, [[there is no]{.mark} obvious [candidate to take
the lead]{.mark}]{.underline} if the United States were to step aside,
and all the obvious candidates face their own significant political
issues at home and abroad. [[The **U**]{.mark}nited
**[K]{.mark}**ingdom**['s]{.mark}** [relationship with]{.mark}
continental [Europe has been strained]{.mark} in the aftermath of its
vote to leave the EU.]{.underline} Its relationship will be further
tested in the months and years to come as that process plays out.\[x\]
Germany's President-elect, former Foreign Minister Frank-Walter
Steinmeier, has broken with Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing
coalition with a more conciliatory tone towards Russia. He has
criticized NATO policies on sanctions and military exercises.\[xi\]
Meanwhile, [[France remains in]{.mark} a [constant state of]{.mark} high
[alert]{.mark}]{.underline} following a string of terrorist attacks over
the past several years---a threat it is not alone in facing---with new
plots being uncovered and thwarted in February and troops remaining
deployed on the streets.\[xii\]

[These existing political issues are [aggravated by]{.mark} the fact
that the UK, Germany, and France all face **[populist]{.mark} or
nationalist [surges]{.mark}** [in their domestic politics]{.mark}, a
trend seen across Europe.]{.underline} The UK Independence Party played

[The global balance of power has shifted dramatically, and **the need
for a U.S.-dominated transatlantic alliance has
disappeared**]{.underline}. [Instead of promoting NATO's
expansion]{.underline}, the [Biden]{.underline} Administration **[should
be plotting the alliance's transformation]{.underline}**. That would
conveniently coincide with increased European interest in greater
continental military capabilities. For decades, successive U.S.
administrations discouraged member governments from developing forces
separate from the alliance. Today such a shift should be Washington's
objective.

The U.S. remains the world's most important nation --- largest economy,
greatest soft power, dominant military. However, America's edge in those
areas is shrinking. And its weaknesses, compounding extraordinarily
bitter political divisions with equally dramatic fiscal
irresponsibility, are significant. Washington cannot forever underwrite
wealthy states which have other priorities, such as investing in their
own welfare states, as in Europe.

Moreover, [**allied relationships** would be **healthier if more
equal**]{.underline}. [American demands that European governments do
more, **but only in ways seen as most advantageous in Washington**, have
undermined the transatlantic relationship]{.underline}. Donald Trump's
verbal eruptions on the issue differed only in tone from the rhetoric of
his predecessors. Illustrating predictable hubris, Washington long has
instructed the Europeans on the sort of militaries it believes they
should maintain.

A European Solution to a European Problem

The basic problem is that there is agreement neither on the degree of
threat nor the most appropriate response. Many NATO members see no
serious dangers, and even those nations which worry about Russia, the
only meaningful military threat to Europe, still mostly rely on
Washington. Consider the Baltic countries: they claim to fear aggression
by Moscow but devote just a couple of cents on the Euro to defense. Do
they really value their independence so little? They should spend far
more and create a territorial defense that would exact a high price for
Russian aggression.

[The solution is simple]{.underline}, if perhaps expensive for [European
states]{.underline}. They **[should assess the risks]{.underline}**,
**[decide on the objectives]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[create
the force structure]{.underline}** [necessary to achieve the
latter]{.underline}. **[The U.S. should aid them]{.underline}** [in this
process]{.underline}, [giving the Europeans time to decide on the mode
of organization and address existing military deficiencies]{.underline}.
However, Washington --- and especially the present administration, known
for its Atlanticist orientation --- should take the lead.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-united-states-should_b_11762584\]

[**NATO is** more **ill-conceived at present**]{.underline}, having
expanded to 28 members, than it was in 1949. Among other things, we are
committed to defending the Baltic States, Hungary, the Czech Republic,
the Slovak Republic, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria from Russian
aggression. The previous occupation or domination of these nations by
the Soviet Union during the Cold War weakened it financially and
militarily. Why should we seek to prevent Russia from repeating that
blunder? [We are also absurdly committed to defending Slovenia, Albania,
Greece, and Croatia\--none of which have relevance to our
self-defense.]{.underline}

[NATO advocates argue that the **spread of democracy makes the**
**U**nited **S**tates **safer**]{.underline}; that we know how to spread
democracy; [and, that tyranny anywhere is a threat to our
security]{.underline}. They substantially echo President George W.
Bush\'s counterfactual Second Inaugural gospel:

\"Across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of
self-government because no one is fit to be a master, and no one
deserves to be a slave. Advancing these ideals is the mission that
created our Nation. It is the honorable achievement of our fathers. Now
it is the urgent requirement of our nation\'s security, and the calling
of our time. So it is the policy of the United States to seek and
support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every
nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our
world.\"

[The NATO-Bush doctrine is unconvincing]{.underline}. The United States
was born and has flourished amidst tyrannies. They include the French
Empire, the Romanoff Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the Chinese Empire, and
the Austrian-Hungarian Empire. [Today, tyranny]{.underline} in Belarus
or Zimbabwe, among other nations, [is **no danger to** the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}. [Our peaceful co-existence with tyrannies has
been the rule]{.underline}, not the exception.

Additionally, we can no more create democracies from cultures and
institutions with no democratic DNA hostile than we can build a
perpetual motion machine. We have failed spectacularly attempting the
impossible in South Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and
Yemen despite a staggering investment of resources. South Sudan is
conclusive proof of our impotence to give birth to democratic
dispensations. We midwifed its 2011 independence from Sudan, but It
quickly succumbed to a grisly ethnic civil war between President Salva
Kiir and the Dinka against Rick Machar and the Nuer featuring tens of
thousands killed and millions displaced. South Sudan was a failed state
on arrival, and remains so today. Our efforts to collaborate with its
leaders and people to steer a democratic course were predictably futile.

The evidence is mixed as to whether democracies are inherently less
threatening to the United States than are authoritarian or tyrannical
nations. Hamas was popularly elected in the Gaza Strip, but is listed as
an international terrorist organization by the United States. Egypt\'s
former President Mohammad Morsi was a greater danger to United States
interests than is his less democratically elected successor Abdel Fattah
el-Sisi. The United States has refrained from clamor for free elections
in Saudi Arabia for fear of the results, i.e., victory for Wahhabism.
Tyranny by the majority is tyranny nonetheless. In any event, the
evidence is far too inconclusive to assert that wars against
non-democratic nations are, ipso facto, justifiable wars of
self-defense.

[In **leaving NATO**, **the** **U**nited **S**tates would dramatically
**lessen tensions** or conflicts **with Russia**]{.underline} [and
**strengthen** our **security against external
aggression**]{.underline}. [Among other things]{.underline}, [**the
stage would be set for a new treaty** to **reduce the nuclear arsenals**
of the two countries.]{.underline} [Russia would probably claim a sphere
of influence over its neighbors, but that would be
unalarming.]{.underline} The United States has acted in the same way for
more than two centuries, including the Monroe Doctrine, the
Mexican-American War, the Spanish-American War, the Panama Canal, and
military ventures in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and
Nicaragua. To maintain that all nations are equal, but that the United
States is more equal than others is to encourage war.

[**To make the nation more secure** in its safety, wealth, and liberty,
**NATO should be made a museum piece**]{.underline} [along with other
**artifacts of the American Empire**]{.underline}.

#### Decreasing expansionist pressures against Russia good -- prevents escalating retaliatory behaviours from Moscow. 

Ted Galen **Carpenter 22** \[Ted Galen Carpenter, a senior fellow in
defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, is the author

would lead to war. Those warnings were ignored". 28 February 2022.
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/28/nato-expansion-war-russia-ukraine>\]

He was right, but [US and Nato leaders proceeded with **new rounds of
expansion**]{.underline}, [including the provocative step of **adding
the three Baltic republics**]{.underline}. Those countries not only had
been part of the Soviet Union, but they had also been part of Russia's
empire during the Czarist era. [That wave of expansion now had Nato
perched on the border of the Russian Federation]{.underline}.

Moscow's patience with Nato's ever more intrusive behavior was wearing
thin. The last reasonably friendly warning from Russia that the alliance
needed to back off came in March 2007, when Putin addressed the annual
Munich security conference. "Nato has put its frontline forces on our
borders," Putin complained. [Nato expansion "represents a serious
provocation that reduces the level of mutual trust]{.underline}. And we
have the right to ask: **[against whom is this expansion
intended]{.underline}**? [And what happened to the assurances our
western partners made after the dissolution of the Warsaw
Pact?"]{.underline}

In his memoir, Duty, Robert M Gates, who served as secretary of defense
in the administrations of both George W Bush and Barack Obama, stated
his belief that "the relationship with Russia had been badly mismanaged
after \[George HW\] Bush left office in 1993". Among other missteps, "US
agreements with the Romanian and Bulgarian governments to rotate troops
through bases in those countries was a needless provocation." In an
implicit rebuke to the younger Bush, Gates asserted that "trying to
bring Georgia and Ukraine into Nato was truly overreaching". That move,
he contended, was a case of "recklessly ignoring what the Russians
considered their own vital national interests".

[The following year, the Kremlin demonstrated that its discontent with
Nato's continuing incursions]{.underline} **[into Russia's security
zone]{.underline}** had [moved beyond verbal objections]{.underline}.
[Moscow exploited a foolish provocation by Georgia's pro‐​western
government to launch a **military offensive** that brought Russian
troops to the outskirts of the capital.]{.underline} Thereafter, Russia
permanently detached two secessionist‐​minded Georgian regions and put
them under effective Russian control.

[Western (especially US) leaders continued to **blow through red warning
light** after a red warning light]{.underline}, however. [The Obama
administration's shockingly arrogant meddling in Ukraine's internal
political affairs in 2013 and 2014 to help demonstrators overthrow
Ukraine's elected, pro‐​Russia president was the single most **brazen
provocation**]{.underline}, [and it caused **tensions to
spike**]{.underline}. Moscow immediately responded by seizing and
annexing Crimea, and a new cold war was underway with a vengeance.

**[Could the Ukraine crisis have been avoided?]{.underline}**

Events during the past few months constituted the last chance to avoid a
hot war in eastern Europe. Putin demanded that Nato provide guarantees
on several security issues. Specifically, [the Kremlin wanted binding
assurances that the alliance would reduce the scope of its growing
military presence]{.underline} in eastern Europe and would never offer
membership to Ukraine. [He **backed up those demands** with a massive
military buildup on Ukraine's borders.]{.underline}

The Biden administration's response to Russia's quest for meaningful
western concessions and security guarantees was tepid and evasive. Putin
then clearly decided to escalate matters. [Washington's attempt to make
Ukraine a **Nato political and military pawn**]{.underline} (even absent
the country's formal membership in the alliance) [may end up costing the
Ukrainian people dearly.]{.underline}

### Avoids \-\-- Russia DA \-\-- 2NC

#### Collapsing NATO solves tensions with Russia -- ends the war in Ukraine too.

Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science at the
University of Chicago. "John Mearsheimer on why the West is principally
responsible for the Ukrainian crisis." March 19^th^, 2022.
https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/03/11/john-mearsheimer-on-why-the-west-is-principally-responsible-for-the-ukrainian-crisis\]

But that story is wrong. [The West, and **especially
America**]{.underline}, [is **principally responsible** for the
crisis]{.underline} which began in February 2014. [It has now turned
into a war that not only **threatens to destroy Ukraine**]{.underline},
[but also]{.underline} has [the potential to escalate into a **nuclear
war**]{.underline} [between **Russia and NATO**]{.underline}.

The trouble over Ukraine actually started at NATO's Bucharest summit in
April 2008, when George W. Bush's administration pushed the alliance to
announce that Ukraine and Georgia "will become members". Russian leaders
responded immediately with outrage, characterising this decision as an
existential threat to Russia and vowing to thwart it. According to a
respected Russian journalist, Mr Putin "flew into a rage" and warned
that "if Ukraine joins NATO, it will do so without Crimea and the
eastern regions. It will simply fall apart." America ignored Moscow's
red line, however, and pushed forward to make Ukraine a Western bulwark
on Russia's border. That strategy included two other elements: bringing
Ukraine closer to the eu and making it a pro-American democracy.

These efforts eventually sparked hostilities in February 2014, after an
uprising (which was supported by America) caused Ukraine's pro-Russian
president, Viktor Yanukovych, to flee the country. In response, Russia
took Crimea from Ukraine and helped fuel a civil war that broke out in
the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.

[The next **major confrontation**]{.underline} [came in December 2021
and led **directly to the current war**]{.underline}. [The main cause
was that Ukraine was becoming a **de facto member of
NATO**]{.underline}. [The process started in December 2017]{.underline},
when the Trump administration decided to [sell Kyiv "defensive
weapons".]{.underline} What counts as "defensive" is hardly clear-cut,
however, and these weapons certainly looked offensive to Moscow and its
allies in the Donbas region. **[Other NATO countries got in on the
act]{.underline}**, [shipping weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}, training
its armed forces and allowing it to participate in joint air and naval
exercises. In July 2021, [Ukraine and America co-hosted a major naval
exercise]{.underline} in the Black Sea region involving navies from 32
countries. Operation Sea Breeze almost provoked Russia to fire at a
British naval destroyer that deliberately entered what Russia considers
its territorial waters.

[The links between Ukraine and America continued growing under the Biden
administration]{.underline}. This commitment is reflected throughout an
important document---the "us-Ukraine Charter on Strategic
Partnership"---that was signed in November by Antony Blinken, America's
secretary of state, and Dmytro Kuleba, his Ukrainian counterpart. The
aim was to "underscore ... a commitment to Ukraine's implementation of
the deep and comprehensive reforms necessary for full integration into
European and Euro-Atlantic institutions." The document explicitly builds
on "the commitments made to strengthen the Ukraine-u.s. strategic
partnership by Presidents Zelensky and Biden," and also emphasises that
the two countries will be guided by the "2008 Bucharest Summit
Declaration."

Unsurprisingly, [Moscow found this evolving situation intolerable and
began mobilising its army on Ukraine's border last spring to **signal
its resolve to Washington**]{.underline}. **[But it had no
effect]{.underline}**, as the Biden administration continued to move
closer to Ukraine. This led Russia to precipitate a full-blown
diplomatic stand-off in December. As Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign
minister, put it: "We reached our boiling point." [Russia demanded a
written guarantee that Ukraine would never **become a part of
NATO**]{.underline} [and that the alliance **remove the military
assets**]{.underline} it had deployed in eastern Europe since 1997. The
subsequent negotiations failed, as Mr Blinken made clear: "There is no
change. There will be no change." A month later Mr Putin launched an
invasion of Ukraine to eliminate the threat he saw from NATO.

This interpretation of events is at odds with the prevailing mantra in
the West, which portrays NATO expansion as irrelevant to the Ukraine
crisis, blaming instead Mr Putin's expansionist goals. According to a
recent NATO document sent to Russian leaders, "NATO is a defensive
Alliance and poses no threat to Russia." The available evidence
contradicts these claims. For starters, the issue at hand is not what
Western leaders say NATO's purpose or intentions are; it is how Moscow
sees NATO's actions.

Mr Putin surely knows that the costs of conquering and occupying large
amounts of territory in eastern Europe would be prohibitive for Russia.
As he once put it, "Whoever does not miss the Soviet Union has no heart.
Whoever wants it back has no brain." His beliefs about the tight bonds
between Russia and Ukraine notwithstanding, trying to take back all of
Ukraine would be like trying to swallow a porcupine. Furthermore,
Russian policymakers---including Mr Putin---have said hardly anything
about conquering new territory to recreate the Soviet Union or build a
greater Russia. Rather, since the 2008 Bucharest summit Russian leaders
have repeatedly said that they view Ukraine joining NATO as an
existential threat that must be prevented. As Mr Lavrov noted in
January, "the key to everything is the guarantee that NATO will not
expand eastward."

Tellingly, [Western leaders rarely described Russia as a military threat
to Europe before 2014]{.underline}. As America's former ambassador to
Moscow Michael McFaul notes, Mr Putin's seizure of Crimea was not
planned for long; it was an impulsive move in response to the coup that
overthrew Ukraine's pro-Russian leader. In fact, until then, NATO
expansion was aimed at turning all of Europe into a giant zone of peace,
not containing a dangerous Russia. [Once the crisis
started]{.underline}, however, [American and European policymakers could
not admit they had **provoked it**]{.underline} by [trying to integrate
Ukraine into the West]{.underline}. [They declared the real source of
the problem was Russia's revanchism and its desire to dominate if not
conquer Ukraine.]{.underline}

My story about the conflict's causes should not be controversial, given
that many prominent American foreign-policy experts have warned against
NATO expansion since the late 1990s. America's secretary of defence at
the time of the Bucharest summit, Robert Gates, recognised that "trying
to bring Georgia and Ukraine into NATO was truly overreaching". Indeed,
at that summit, both the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the
French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, were opposed to moving forward on
NATO membership for Ukraine because they feared it would infuriate
Russia.

The upshot of my interpretation is that we are in an extremely dangerous
situation, and Western policy is exacerbating these risks. For Russia's
leaders, what happens in Ukraine has little to do with their imperial
ambitions being thwarted; it is about dealing with what they regard as a
direct threat to Russia's future. Mr Putin may have misjudged Russia's
military capabilities, the effectiveness of the Ukrainian resistance and
the scope and speed of the Western response, but one should never
underestimate how ruthless great powers can be when they believe they
are in dire straits. America and its allies, however, are doubling down,
hoping to inflict a humiliating defeat on Mr Putin and to maybe even
trigger his removal. They are increasing aid to Ukraine while using
economic sanctions to inflict massive punishment on Russia, a step that
Putin now sees as "akin to a declaration of war".

America and its allies may be able to prevent a Russian victory in
Ukraine, but the country will be gravely damaged, if not dismembered.
Moreover, there is a serious threat of escalation beyond Ukraine, not to
mention the danger of nuclear war. If the West not only thwarts Moscow
on Ukraine's battlefields, but also does serious, lasting damage to
Russia's economy, it is in effect pushing a great power to the brink. Mr
Putin might then turn to nuclear weapons.

At this point [it is impossible to know the terms on which this conflict
will be settled]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}**, [if we do not
understand its deep cause]{.underline}, [we will be unable to end it
before Ukraine is wrecked and NATO **ends up in a war with
Russia**]{.underline}.

#### NATO currently operates as a trojan horse of [American imperialism]{.underline} and American military dominance in Europe threatens [militarisation]{.underline} and [aggression]{.underline} -- [nuclear war]{.underline}. 

Phil **Hearse 3-15** \[Phil Hearse writes for the Socialist Resistance
and Mutiny websites, is co-author of Creeping Fascism (2019). "NATO,
imperialism and the war." 15 March 2022.
https://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article7563\]

At the other extreme, some left-wingers seem to regard the Ukraine
crisis merely as a national liberation war, in which Ukraine is fighting
a just war against Russia, and the role of NATO is simply to provide
large amounts of weaponry to the Ukrainian people. As we discuss below,
this is naïve. [NATO is clearly trying to use the war to advance its own
objectives, particularly those of **American imperialism.**]{.underline}

One socialist website opposes any end to the war in which Ukraine makes
concessions. \[2\] This is the wrong way to pose it. The crucial thing
now from the viewpoint of the Ukrainian people is to have a ceasefire
and to stop the war. It is up to the Ukrainian people themselves to
decide on any concessions---temporary or long-term--- to Russia, however
much they may rankle. There is a long history of schematic sectarians
opposing necessary concessions to end wars---starting with the
opposition in the Bolshevik party, led by Bukharin and Radek, to the
signing of the 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in which multiple
concessions were made by Russia to Germany in order to end the war
between them. The charge of 'capitulation' was also made against North
Vietnam when it engaged in negotiations that led to the withdrawal of
American troops in 1973. The Ukrainian government has indicated that it
supports a ceasefire and negotiations, and we should back that.

So **[what is the real role of NATO?]{.underline}** There are two
aspects to this. [The first is the danger of a clash between NATO and
Russian forces]{.underline} which could lead to a central European war,
[something that would be disastrous.]{.underline} A no-fly zone, even
one policed by planes provided by NATO member Poland, could lead to a
direct conflict between Russia and NATO. [A wider war against Russia in
Europe would collapse the world economy and could **lead to the use of
nuclear weapons.**]{.underline} Anti-war activists should be absolutely
opposed to any involvement of NATO forces in the fighting.

[Washington's negative response]{.underline} to Poland's offer of 28
reconditioned MiG29 planes to operate a no-fly zone [indicates
that]{.underline}, for the moment, the United States [doesn't want to
risk a **wider war** with Russia]{.underline}. [But **Biden's government
is weak**]{.underline} [and the pressure from the political
**right**]{.underline} --- in Britain and well as the US --- **[is very
strong]{.underline}**. [At a future stage]{.underline}, [popular
outrage]{.underline} at Russian atrocities **[could lead to calls for
NATO intervention]{.underline}** [that would be difficult to
resist.]{.underline}

But **[the second]{.underline}** [aspect to the role of
NATO]{.underline}, and a key one, [is as a political-military alliance
dominated by the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates and its loyal British followers, [using the war
to reshape the relationship between the most powerful imperialist
states]{.underline} in the world today---[Russia, China and the United
States]{.underline} itself. [This is the **inter-imperialist
conflict**]{.underline} [which is increasingly interwoven with the war
in Ukraine itself.]{.underline}

Such a complex configuration should come as no surprise, especially to
Marxists, who have long pointed out how particular wars can become
entwined with more over-arching conflicts. Ernest Mandel in his
brilliant book, The Meaning of [the Second World War]{.underline},
[explains how]{.underline}, in countries such as Greece, Italy, Vietnam,
Yugoslavia, China, France and many others, [Allied governments
like]{.underline} those of Britain and [the United States]{.underline}
[intervened directly or through local reactionary forces]{.underline} to
defeat Germany and Japan, but [at the same time to defeat progressive or
revolutionary local movements]{.underline}. [Inter-imperialist
conflicts]{.underline} [became]{.underline} **[entwined with wars of
national liberation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[revolutionary
advance.]{.underline}**

Today, [the US economic war against Russia]{.underline}, designed to
collapse the Russian economy and hobble Russia's economic and political
clout in the long-term, [is becoming interwoven with the war in
Ukraine.]{.underline} By his brutal and utterly ruthless unleashing of
Russian military power against Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has handed a
series of massive victories to the United States in its battle against
Russia, a battle waged in preparation for the more decisive battle to
come, the United States against China.

Putin's war will have savage costs for both middle-class and
working-class Russians but much less so for the oligarchs, who always
find ways to hide their wealth. Car factories are already closing in
Russia, as Western companies pull out and Russian firms can't find
essential components. The blockade on computer chips will mean dozens of
hi-tech firms won't find the necessary components to continue unless
China can step in and provide them, something unlikely given the already
existing world shortage of silicon chips.

Dozens of retail brands are pulling out and that means thousands of lost
jobs. Apple, Samsung and Microsoft are pulling out together with scores
of other hi-tech companies. H&M, Levis and Zara are leaving, as is Nike,
Puma and Adidas. This is not just a matter of fashion-conscious young
urbanites being unable to get their favourite brands, it is a matter of
many thousands of lost jobs. Even Russian Vodka, fish products and
diamonds are to be sanctioned. It is estimated that Russian GDP will
decline by 20% in the next year, a level which goes beyond recession and
slump to onrushing economic collapse. The result will be mass
unemployment and mass poverty in Russia as a consequence, not of the
actions of the Russian workers, but as a result of the actions of Putin
and his fellow oligarchs and criminals in power. This is another example
of punishing the civilian population. No socialist or democrat should
support this kind of imperialist economic warfare.

Russia will also suffer from sanctions on exports, not just energy
exports but also exports of wheat. Russia and Ukraine together produce
30% of the world's wheat, and its elimination will skyrocket the price
of bread in the region, and worldwide. Preventing the export of Russian
energy will also hit the working class worldwide as the price of just
about everything which at some stage needs oil and gas increases in
price, giving another twist to the worldwide inflationary cycle. The
stage is being set for a massive world slump in which the effects of the
Covid pandemic combine with the effects of the war and sanctions.

A key US target is the relationship between Russia and Europe. The
United States has long campaigned against Europe's reliance on Russian
energy and even before the Ukraine crisis blew up, was urging Germany to
stop importing huge amounts of Russian gas and oil. The United States
pointed out that the shortfall of such a transition could be made up by
imports from...the United States itself! America has long campaigned
against any improvement of political and diplomatic relations with
Russia. It has tried at every stage to characterise Russia as a
terrorist state, an effort greatly aided by the behaviour of Putin's
state apparatus, especially the assassination of exiled Russian
opponents living in the UK.

The United States is opposed to the European Union establishing its own
international political and military presence just about anywhere. That,
thinks Washington, would encroach on NATO's role. So for example the
AUKUS military alliance in the Pacific ---composed of the US and its
loyal allies Britain and Australia--- was announced on the very day that
the EU had planned to unveil its Strategy for Cooperation in the
Indo-Pacific. \[3\] The EU document represented an attempt to get Europe
to speak with one voice on the region, and chart an independent course,
especially in relation to China, away from the hostile US position.
AUKUS was a precisely aimed torpedo that badly holed the EU strategy.

NATO from its beginning has been designed to tie European states to
American diplomatic, military and political leadership. It has had the
effect in Britain itself of building up a strong 'Atlanticism' political
trend, represented especially by the mainstream of the Conservative
Party. But economic links between Europe and Russia inevitably
reconfigured political relations.

Disrupting economic and diplomatic relations between Russia and Germany
has been an enormous victory for the United States. American
commentators have been complaining for years that Germany's economic and
political model is based on getting its energy from Russia, its security
from the United States and its cheap consumer goods from China. It might
be added that China is the place where a big proportion of Germany's
manufacturers, raw materials and chemical products go. Now the United
States wants Germany and other European states to stop their energy
imports from Russia and look elsewhere, particularly to the United
States itself.

[Western sanctions against Russia are]{.underline} enormous and at a
level you might expect if NATO was at war with Russia. The seizure of
most of Russia's foreign exchange reserves -----more than \$600 billion
worth---is designed to hobble the Russian economy. There is [no
guarantee that this will be a short term measure designed to stop the
war in Ukraine.]{.underline}

Now the rightwing Western media and foreign policy establishment is
turning the attack against China. This combines a number of levels.
First, Western rightwing politicians say that China, by failing to
condemn the Russian invasion, is acting in a way that gives economic and
political cover to Russia. Second, China itself could organise its own
'Ukraine' by invading Taiwan, and this eventuality is being prepared for
by the export of ever-larger amounts of military aid to Taiwan, despite
Xi Jinping's repeated statements that China seeks reunification only by
peaceful means, and that Beijing's economic relations with Taipei are
extremely profitable for both sides. For Western analysts, China's
seizure of reefs and small islands in the South China Sea is proof of
its militarist expansionism.

However, there is no doubt that the militarisation of the South China
Sea is primarily the work of the United States and its allies, whose
military doctrine is preparing for a possible war aimed at Chinese
coastal cities and military bases.

Obviously, [the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} [is using its massive
military power to influence the outcome of the fighting in
Ukraine]{.underline}, and the resistance in that country is massively
armed with powerful US anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. According
to the New York Times, the United States sent 17,000 anti-tank missiles
to Ukraine in one week. But those who support the Ukrainian right to
resist invasion cannot complain about where the weapons of the Ukrainian
military and civilian resistance come from. However, if a no-fly zone
were to be implemented, even if it involved Polish planes flown by
Ukrainian pilots, it is highly likely that they would be co-ordinated by
American or British AWACS planes, (literally early warning and control
radar platforms) with the ability to 'see' what the Polish planes
themselves cannot. This could be done by AWACS planes flying from
outside Ukraine, but the temptation for advanced Russian fighter planes
to shoot them down would be enormous. A no-fly zone cannot be engineered
without the danger of a direct clash between NATO and Russia.

[Both in relation to Russia and China]{.underline}, [the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} [has adopted the position]{.underline} of the
1997 Project for the Next American Century, [which projected American
**military dominance** as the road to political and economic
dominance.]{.underline} It also argued for rearmament to a level where
the United States could simultaneously fight two major wars, obviously
against Russia and China. [The profligate use of military power has led
to catastrophes in Iraq and Afghanistan and could lead to a much worse
catastrophe in a **nuclear exchange** with Russia.]{.underline}

Raising the slogans of 'No to NATO Expansion' and 'No to Nuclear War' is
clearly correct for the anti-war movement, but cannot be the central
demands, which remain Russian troops out and stop the war. Nonetheless,
[NATO's role in Eastern Europe since the final collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991 has been pernicious]{.underline}. American President
George [Bush]{.underline} Snr, absolutely [refused to respond to the
demise of its military enemies in Russia and Eastern Europe by
**disbanding NATO**]{.underline} or responding to Mikhail Gorbachev's
project of a 'Common European Homeland' of states outside military
pacts. **[Disbanding NATO]{.underline}** [would]{.underline} have
[disrupted the key instrument of American military]{.underline}, and
hence political, control. Moreover, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has insisted on
expanding the boundaries of NATO]{.underline} right up to the borders of
Russia in every case. This of course is something that the United
States--- the inclusion of Mexico or Canada in a hostile military
alliance on US borders ---would bever accept.

[The iron grip of NATO is designed to ensure American
dominance]{.underline}, and hence loyalty in inter-imperialist conflicts
of European states to the United States. It is no wonder then that the
question of NATO has become a key line of a divide as far as the Keir
Starmer leadership in the Labour Party is concerned. Starmer and his
parliamentary whips threatened to exclude 12 Labour MPs from the
Parliamentary Labour Party if they spoke at a rally with an anti-NATO
message. Starmer has repeatedly stated Labour's complete loyalty to
NATO, a message to the British capitalist class that under him Labour
can be trusted. Technically any member of CND could be excluded from the
Labour Party because of the campaign's anti-NATO position, although for
the moment this is unlikely to be implemented. In the context of
Starmer's prostration before NATO and British capitalism, it is strange
to find a left-wing website attacking Jeremy Corbyn for making 'an
anti-NATO speech. \[4\]

In the context of the present war, it is utterly cynical for Russian
foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to excuse atrocities committed by Russian
forces by reference to what the West did in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'If
you can commit anti-civilian atrocities, then so can we' is unlikely to
be a convincing argument as far as world public opinion is concerned.
Even worse, Russian commentators on Channel 4 News merely say 'war is
hell, this is war'. [The death, pain, suffering and misery imposed on
the Ukrainian people **cannot be justified**]{.underline} by any
reference to the crimes of the West, whether the leading Western states
were wearing their NATO hats or not. The central slogans of the Left and
all progressive forces have to be against the Russian war, for a
ceasefire and a withdrawal of all Russian troops.

In Britain, there is an enormous mobilisation of ordinary people and
even whole communities to give material aid to refugees from Ukraine.
Polish centres up and down the country, as well as Ukrainian community
centres, are awash with donations of money, clothes, sleeping bags and
other necessities that refugees might need for their onward journeys. Of
course, this outburst of social solidarity is promoted by the awful
scenes of carnage and destruction in Ukraine. It's true that the
incredible brutality of the Western-backed and organised bombing
campaign by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has not produced such an
outpouring of solidarity, because it has been barely covered in the mass
media, and because Ukrainians are 'people like us.'

Nonetheless, people who collect support for Ukrainian refugees, and
millions more, are rightly horrified by the Russian attacks and their
dreadful consequences. The anti-war movement cannot turn its face away
from these people but should participate, to the best of our ability, in
such actions. We must get people giving material aid and demand refugees
be admitted to Britain.

[Because of the ongoing inter-imperialist conflict]{.underline}, [there
are competing narratives]{.underline} about what is happening [on a
world scale]{.underline}. The overwhelming narrative in the Western
media is about the defence of democracy against Russian and Chinese
dictatorship and aggression. But **[in reality]{.underline}**, [there is
a huge and developing inter-imperialist conflict]{.underline}, [in which
the **U**nited **S**tates is a **major source of militarisation and
aggression.**]{.underline}

Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Ambroise Fayolle
commented: "The COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's war against Ukraine are a
human tragedy and impact global energy and food security. Both crises
also have significant consequences for the global fight against climate

Alexander Stubb, Director of the School of Transnational Governance,
said: "Climate change is a defining challenge of our time, which will

need to change mainstream finance]{.underline}. This is not, we\'re not
going to get to net-zero in a niche. I\'m on double that number that you
quoted in terms of the orders of magnitude that need to be invested.

And [if you think about what\'s the change]{.underline}, [with the
industrial revolution]{.underline}, [what we had was **fractional
reserve banking**]{.underline}, [increased leverage and maturity
transformation]{.underline}. **[You had central banks playing a new

[And you had an **international monetary system** that was put together

#### Climate change causes cascading [biodiversity loss]{.underline}, [escalating inequality]{.underline}, new and more [fatal diseases]{.underline} and [extinction]{.underline}.

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jan/13/top-scientists-warn-of-ghastly-future-of-mass-extinction-and-climate-disruption-aoe\]

[The planet is facing]{.underline} a "ghastly future of **[mass
extinction]{.underline}**, [declining health and climate-disruption
upheavals]{.underline}" [that threaten]{.underline} **[human
survival]{.underline}** [because of ignorance and inaction]{.underline},
[according to]{.underline} **[an international group of
scientists]{.underline}**, [who warn]{.underline} people still haven't
grasped [the urgency of the biodiversity and climate
crises.]{.underline}

The 17 experts, including Prof Paul [Ehrlich from Stanford]{.underline}
University, author of The Population Bomb, [and scientists]{.underline}
from Mexico, Australia and the US, [say the planet is **in a much worse
state** than most people]{.underline} -- even scientists --
[understood]{.underline}.

"[The scale of the threats to]{.underline} the biosphere and **[all its
lifeforms]{.underline}** -- [including humanity]{.underline} -- is in
fact so great that it [is difficult to grasp]{.underline} for even
well-informed experts," they write in a report in Frontiers in
Conservation Science which references more than 150 studies detailing
the world's major environmental challenges.

The delay between destruction of the natural world and the impacts of
these actions means people do not recognise how vast the problem is, the
paper argues. "\[The\] mainstream is having difficulty grasping the
magnitude of this loss, despite the steady erosion of the fabric of
human civilisation."

[The report warns]{.underline} that **[climate-induced mass
migrations]{.underline}**, **[more pandemics]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[conflicts]{.underline}** [over
resources]{.underline} **[will be inevitable]{.underline}** [unless
urgent action is taken.]{.underline}

"Ours is not a call to surrender -- we aim to provide leaders with a
realistic 'cold shower' of the state of the planet that is essential for
planning to avoid a ghastly future," it adds.

Dealing with the enormity of the problem requires far-reaching changes
to global capitalism, education and equality, the paper says. These
include abolishing the idea of perpetual economic growth, properly
pricing environmental externalities, stopping the use of fossil fuels,
reining in corporate lobbying, and empowering women, the researchers
argue.

The report comes months after the world failed to meet a single UN Aichi
biodiversity target, created to stem the destruction of the natural
world, the second consecutive time governments have failed to meet their
10-year biodiversity goals. This week a coalition of more than 50
countries pledged to protect almost a third of the planet by 2030.

"[Environmental deterioration is infinitely more threatening to
civilisation]{.underline} than Trumpism or Covid-19," Ehrlich told the
Guardian.

In The Population Bomb, published in 1968, Ehrlich warned of imminent
population explosion and hundreds of millions of people starving to
death. Although he has acknowledged some timings were wrong, he has said
he stands by its fundamental message that population growth and high
levels of consumption by wealthy nations is driving destruction.

He told the Guardian: "Growthmania is the fatal disease of
civilisation - it must be replaced by campaigns that make equity and
well-being society's goals - not consuming more junk."

Large populations and their continued growth drive soil degradation and
biodiversity loss, the new paper warns. "More people means that more
synthetic compounds and dangerous throwaway plastics are manufactured,
many of which add to the growing toxification of the Earth. It also
increases the chances of pandemics that fuel ever-more desperate hunts
for scarce resources."

[The effects of the **climate emergency**]{.underline} [are more evident
than biodiversity loss]{.underline}, but still, society is failing to
cut emissions, the paper argues. If people understood the magnitude of
the crises, changes in politics and policies could match the gravity of
the threat.

Russian troops]{.underline}. Certainly Putin would also see an
opportunity to seize more of Ukraine without the "shadow" of NATO to
protect it.

History teaches us that major wars start when aggressive leaders
miscalculate. German leader Adolf Hitler attacked Poland in 1939,
believing that after then-British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's
Munich Agreement, England would be unlikely to respond. North Korea
attacked South Korea in 1950 after the United States appeared to remove
Seoul from its defensive perimeter. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded
Kuwait in 1990, believing the United States had signaled that it would
not respond.

In each case, miscalculation led to larger conflict.

Secondly, [NATO's retirement would also decrease American military
reach]{.underline}, its political influence **[and its economic
advantage]{.underline}**. [American bases throughout Europe not only
provide for the defense of Europe]{.underline} --- [they bring the U.S.
a continent closer to trouble spots]{.underline} [that threaten vital
**American interests**]{.underline}. [Fighting the Islamic
State]{.underline} group, clearly an American interest, [would have been
markedly more difficult]{.underline} without permanent U.S. bases in
Europe and without the American-built coalition that included every NATO
nation. [Without NATO, the mutual security interests that underpin both
U.S. bases and coalition operations would be undermined.]{.underline}

This extends to the economic realm. [U.S. annual trade in goods and
services with Europe exceeds **\$1 trillion**]{.underline}, and U.S.
total direct investment in Europe nears \$3 trillion. [These economic
ties enhance U.S. prosperity and provide American jobs]{.underline}, but
they require the degree of security now provided by NATO to endure.

NATO's retirement would thirdly exacerbate divisions within Europe.
[NATO's glue not only holds European militaries together]{.underline}
--- it provides the principal forum to discuss and coordinate security
issues. The European Union is unlikely to substitute for NATO in this
respect because it has no military structure, few capabilities and no
superpower leadership to bring divergent views together.

Germany and France already seek a plan B should NATO collapse, but
without the United Kingdom in the European Union, an all-European
approach is likely to fail. The added insecurity of NATO's collapse
would also amplify current populist movements in Europe. The consequence
could be renationalization of European militaries, a system that brought
conflict to the 19th and early 20th centuries.

The fourth consequences of life without NATO would be global. [American
bilateral alliances in Asia would each be shaken]{.underline} to their
core **[should NATO fail]{.underline}**. [America's defense commitments
there would become worthless]{.underline}. With China determined to
claim a dominant position in Asia, [the collapse of NATO would cause
America's Asian partners to **seek accommodation with
China**]{.underline}, much as the Philippines is in the process of
doing.

Trump's decision to abandon the economic Trans-Pacific Partnership
agreement has already given China new advantages in the region. Without
credible American security commitments, [there would be little to stop
China from controlling the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea]{.underline} and
probably occupying Taiwan as well. Add to this equation the new
footholds that China is building in central Asia, Africa and Europe:
[Abandoning NATO would help assure China's competitive
success.]{.underline}

The final impact of NATO's retirement would be [the near collapse of
what has been called the **"liberal international order."**]{.underline}
This order consists of treaties, alliances, agreements, institutions and
modes of [behavior mostly created by the **U**nited **S**tates in an
effort to safeguard democracies.]{.underline}

This order has kept relative peace in the trans-Atlantic space for seven
decades. The Trump administration has begun to unravel elements of this
order in the naive notion that they undercut American sovereignty. [The
entire European project is built on the edifice of this order. NATO is
its principal keystone.]{.underline} [Collapsing this edifice would
undercut]{.underline} the multiple structures that have brought seven
**[decades of peace and prosperity]{.underline}**.

### Prevents Russian Expansion \-\-- 2AC

#### American power in Europe protects it from Russian encroachment and eastern European nuclear proliferation.

The argument isn't wholly wrong. Putin's wars are indeed meant, in part,
to push Western influence back from Russia's frontiers. But [the idea
that NATO expansion is the root of today's problems is morally and
**geopolitically bizarre.**]{.underline}

Far from being a historic blunder, [NATO expansion was one of the great
American successes of the post-Cold War era]{.underline}. [Far from
being the act of a domineering superpower]{.underline}, [it was part of
a long tradition of vulnerable states]{.underline} begging to [join
America's liberal empire]{.underline}. And far from posing a mortal
threat to Moscow, [NATO enlargement actually **provided Russia with far
greater security**]{.underline} than it could have provided itself.

NATO was founded in 1949 with 12 members in Western Europe and North
America. It gradually added additional states --- Turkey, Greece, West
Germany, Spain --- over the course of the Cold War. But the big bang of
enlargement came once the superpower conflict ended. NATO incorporated
the former East Germany into the alliance in 1990; it then added three
Eastern European countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) in
1999; then seven more, including the Baltic states, in 2004.

To understand why NATO grew so rapidly, we have to remember something
that nearly everyone has now forgotten: There was no guarantee that
Europe would be mostly stable, peaceful and democratic after the Cold
War. In fact, [many of the analysts who now view NATO expansion as a
catastrophe once warned that a post-Cold War Europe could become a
**violent hellscape**]{.underline}.

It wasn't an outlandish scenario. A reunified Germany might once again
try to dominate its neighbors; the old enmity between Moscow and Berlin
could reignite. The collapse of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe could
liberate those states to pursue long-suppressed territorial claims and
nationalist agendas. Ethnic tensions and nuclear proliferation might
explode as the Cold War order crumbled.

If the U.S. pulled back once the Soviet threat was gone, there would be
no extra-European superpower to put out fires on a continent with lots
of geopolitical kindling. "The prospect of major crises, even wars, in
Europe is likely to increase dramatically," Mearsheimer predicted in
1990.

[NATO enlargement was the **logical answer** to these
fears]{.underline}. Expansion was a way of binding a reunified Germany
to the West and surrounding it with democratic allies. [Joining NATO
required new members to lay aside any revanchist designs]{.underline},
[while allowing them to pursue economic and political reforms rather
than investing heavily in military capabilities to defend their newly
won autonomy]{.underline}.

[NATO's move to the east]{.underline} also **[ensured that
Poland]{.underline}** [and other states that easily **could have built
nuclear weapons didn't** need to]{.underline}, [because they had
American protection]{.underline}. Most important, [enlargement kept the
U.S. firmly planted in Europe]{.underline}, by preventing the
centerpiece of the transatlantic relationship from becoming obsolete.

No other initiative could have accomplished these objectives.
Partnership for Peace --- a series of loose security cooperation
agreements with former Soviet-bloc states --- didn't offer the ironclad
guarantees that came with NATO membership. (If you want to understand
the difference between "security partner" and "NATO ally," just look at
what is happening today to Ukraine, one of the former.)

The idea of creating a pan-European security architecture (one that
included Russia) had the same defect; plus, it would have given Moscow
veto power over the security arrangements of the countries the Soviet
Union had so recently dominated.

Only [American power and promises could provide **stability in
Europe**]{.underline}, and [NATO was the continent's critical
link]{.underline} to the U.S. Since 1949, Washington had tamped down
rivalries between old enemies such as France and Germany, [while also
**protecting them from external threats**]{.underline}. After 1991,
[NATO expansion took this **zone of peace**]{.underline}, prosperity and
cooperation that had emerged in Western Europe and moved it into Eastern
Europe as well.

The revolutionary nature of this achievement seemed obvious not so long
ago. "Why has Europe been so peaceful since 1989?" Mearsheimer asked in
2010. The answer, he acknowledged, was because "[America has continued
to serve as **Europe's pacifier**]{.underline}," [**protecting the
continent from dangers** within and without]{.underline}.

#### NATO division is good for Russia.

Trump's **[antipathy toward NATO is a good thing for
Russia]{.underline}**, [whether he ultimately withdraws from the
agreement]{.underline} (which would require a one-year notification
period and likely see pushback from Congress) or not. [**Moscow benefits
from divides** between the US and Europe, and **Putin has been trying to
undermine ties** between the two for years.]{.underline}
