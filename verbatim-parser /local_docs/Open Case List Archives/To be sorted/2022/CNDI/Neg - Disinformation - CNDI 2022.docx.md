### 1nc -- disinformation fails

#### Russian disinformation will always fail in the face of Western government transparency

**Hiday '22** (Jeffrey Hiday, director of the Office of Media Relations
at the RAND Corporation, "Russia Will Struggle to Sustain Its
Disinformation Machine, Former New York Times/BBC Chief Tells RAND
Europe", RAND Corporation. 5/24/22.
https://www.rand.org/blog/2022/05/russia-will-struggle-to-sustain-its-disinformation.html)

[As former head of the New York Times and the BBC, Mark Thompson has
tackled disinformation on both sides of the Atlantic. One of his big
takeaways: It\'s not as easy as you might think to sustain a successful
disinformation campaign. "**The Russian disinformation machine has taken
some good kicks because of facts on the ground**,"]{.underline} Thompson
told attendees at a 30th anniversary gathering of RAND Europe council
members and staff. ["It turns out **doing disinformation well is not
pathetically easy**. The Russian disinformation army seems to have been
caught short when the rubber met the road."]{.underline} Thompson,
quizzed on stage by Trusted News Initiative founder and former BBC
journalist Jessica Cecil, noted former President Obama\'s recent line
that disinformation is like flooding the public square with raw sewage.
"That\'s a powerful message, but it\'s the kind of diagnosis I find
inadequate---as if the public are innocent victims of disinformation and
the only policy challenge we face is dealing with the bad actors who
either create or distribute it[." Thompson suggested paying more
attention to **the "demand side" of disinformation**. Many members of
the public go out and actively look for it,"]{.underline} he said. On
the plus side, Thompson reckons lessons must have been learned from the
"wholly inadequate" messaging around Afghanistan withdrawal[. "We get to
early 2022 and now we\'re seeing highly effective, proactive, and
sometimes preemptive Western messaging" about Russia\'s designs on
Ukraine. Those messages, particularly from U.S. and British government
spokespeople, were more proactive and transparent. **"Western messaging
indicated what would happen---and then it happened. That reinforces
trust in government messaging,**"]{.underline} Thompson said. That\'s
not what emanated from the U.S. government at the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, in Thompson\'s view. [**Once you start lying
to the public, then the public says, well, why should we believe you
now**.]{.underline} Even quite small, well-intentioned mistakes like
that can really impair public trust. Mark Thompson Share on Twitter "We
saw well-intentioned disinformation," he said. "Essentially, we were
lied to about actual knowledge of use of masks, which we knew from SARS
worked. It\'s hard to overestimate how damaging that was. It poisoned
the water right at the beginning of the pandemic. Once you start lying
to the public, then the public says, well, why should we believe you
now. Even quite small, well-intentioned mistakes like that can really
impair public trust." When it comes to freedom of speech, Thompson,
perhaps not surprisingly from the perspective of a journalist, sees the
biggest danger as coming from government. "The more zeal and passion I
see for government to \'do something\' about disinformation, the more
nervous I get." Potential solutions? Thompson has a few. ["One good
premise is to **think of people we\'re addressing not as helpless sheep
but as people as smart and savvy as we are**," he said, referring to
fellow journalists. Another: "**The government should start telling the
truth---painful though it can be, all the time without fail---to the
public**."]{.underline}

the official count.

#### US elections already derailed 

**Schouten 22** (Fredreka Schouten, CNN Election deniers are winning
political nominations across the country,\" CNN, 6-15-2022

CL)

***(***CNN) Republican voters this week picked Nevada businessman [Jim
Marchant](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/15/politics/jim-marchant-nevada-secretary-of-state/index.html)
as their nominee for secretary of state, bringing yet another 2020
election denier closer to overseeing elections in 2024 in a presidential
battleground state. Last month, Pennsylvania Republicans chose as their
gubernatorial nominee a staunch defender of former President Donald
Trump and his election falsehoods. And [in New Mexico this
week](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/politics/new-mexico-primary-results-otero-county-certification/index.html),
a GOP-led county commission refused to certify the results of the June 7
primary election in the county, citing concerns about election fraud.
The move prompted legal action from Democratic Secretary of State Maggie
Toulouse Oliver, who this fall will face [a Republican
rival](https://www.facebook.com/melindaa.rivera/videos/396611125633260)
who has called the 2020 election that Trump lost a \"coup\" and has
argued that vote-tallying machines manipulate election results. As a
House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US
Capitol seeks to shed light on the falsehoods that swirled around the
last presidential contest, a growing number of midterm results
underscore how much deep suspicion of the 2020 election has taken root
among Republican primary voters and some of the officials they already
have installed in key positions. \"Week by week, [**the dangers to the
integrity of the election system are increasing**,]{.underline}\"
Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California\'s
law school at Irvine, told CNN on Wednesday. \"It wasn\'t just the
Marchant victory in the primary, and it\'s not just a rogue county board
not doing their job to certify election results. It\'s also a purge
within the party of those voices who have stood up to Trump,\" he said,
citing the politicians who have dropped out of their reelection bids,
were stripped of their GOP leadership posts or lost their seats as the
former President has sought revenge. On Tuesday, for example, South
Carolina GOP Rep. Tom Rice became the first of the 10 House Republicans
who voted for impeachment last year to lose a primary to a Trump-backed
opponent. It\'s not a given, by any means, that [the election doubters
elevated to date will prevail in general elections this
fall]{.underline}. In New Mexico, for instance, Oliver won her 2018
election by a landslide. But the rise of these candidates in state after
state \-- along with the move by commissioners in one New Mexico county
to decline to certify the election results \-- set off fresh alarms
among voting rights experts this week. [\"We\'re in a really dangerous
spot right now]{.underline},\" David Becker, executive director of the
nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research, said Wednesday.
\"The pieces of tinder being laid right in front of our eyes.\" Election
deniers advance Marchant, who has led a coalition of 2022 candidates who
insist the 2020 election was rigged, is the latest proponent of election
fraud claims to move closer to reshaping the election system in a
battleground state crucial to the next presidential election. (The
Silver State, won by President Joe Biden by a little more than 2
percentage points in the last election, has seen many Democratic
victories in recent years but remains increasingly competitive.)
Marchant, a former state assemblyman, has thrust election doubts into
the center of his campaign to become the state\'s next election chief,
saying on his website that his No. 1 priority would be to \"overhaul the
fraudulent election system in Nevada.\" [After **Marchant lost a 2020
bid** for the US House to Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford, he brought a
lawsuit claiming voter fraud, but it was later dismissed. **The
candidate has said he would not have certified**]{.underline}

[**more than 33,500-vote victory** in Nevada had he been secretary of
state in 2020. And, more recently, Marchant has lobbied local
governments to abandon the use of machines to cast and count votes. He
wants to return to [hand-counting
ballots](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/handcounting-ballots-voting-machines/index.html)
\-- a move experts say will cause errors, delays and chaos in future
elections.]{.underline} He will face attorney Cisco Aguilar, who ran
unopposed for the Democratic nomination, in the fall. Marchant did not
respond to interview requests Wednesday. He joins several other
Republicans who have sought to cast doubts on the 2020 election and now
are closer to overseeing elections in key states themselves. In
Pennsylvania, for instance, state Sen. Doug Mastriano \-\-- who played a
key role in efforts to overturn Biden\'s victory in the Keystone State
\-- is the Republican nominee for governor. The Pennsylvania governor
appoints the secretary of state, the person in charge of running the
state\'s elections. And in Michigan, delegates to the state GOP
convention backed **[Kristina Karamo\'s nomination for secretary of
state]{.underline}** [\-- a political newcomer who gained attention
after the 2020 election when she **alleged witnessing fraud as a poll
challenger during** the counting of absentee ballots.]{.underline} She
also signed on to an unsuccessful US Supreme Court challenge to Biden\'s
win. More candidates who are aligned with Trump\'s election views are on
the ballot in states with upcoming primaries, including Arizona[. The
state become a breeding ground for election conspiracy theories,
exemplified by the widely disparaged 2021 review of the 2.1 million
ballots cast in its largest county that, in the end, reaffirmed Biden\'s
narrow victory in Arizona.]{.underline} New Mexico drama In New Mexico,
Oliver has sought and won emergency action from the state Supreme Court
to force the Republican-led commission in Otero County to certify the
June 7 primary \-- a step required for the candidates who won last
week\'s contests to advance to the November ballot. The commissioners
had voted 3-0 on Monday not to certify the results, citing their
distrust of Dominion voting machines. On Wednesday, the high court sided
with Oliver and ordered the commission to act by Friday, the deadline
for counties to sign off on primary election results. (In a statement
Wednesday, a Dominion spokesperson called the county\'s action \"yet
another example of how lies about Dominion have damaged our company and
diminished the public\'s faith in elections.\" The company has filed
several defamation lawsuits against people who have spread falsehoods
about their machines.) In all, more than 7,300 voters in Otero County
cast ballots in last week\'s primary election, according to the
secretary of state\'s office. **[Among the Otero officials voting
against certification this week: Commissioner]{.underline}** [[**Couy

Oliver moved quickly in order to avert a potential broader rebellion.
\"[One of the biggest concerns is that this will spread to different

### 1nc -- no civil war !

#### Despite political division, Civil war in America is unlikely 

**Pazzanese 22,** (Christina Pazzanese, Harvard Staff Writer, January
11, 2022 "We don't need a civil war to be in serious trouble",
https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/01/harvard-political-scientist-says-u-s-civil-war-unlikely/)

As the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at
the U.S. Capitol prepares for televised hearings later this month[,
public attitudes toward the attack are divided sharply along partisan
lines. With extremist movements and rhetoric on the rise, a growing
number of people, including some historians and many opinion writers,
believe the U.S. is on the brink of disaster. A Zogby poll in the fall
found that 46 percent of Americans think the country is headed for
another civil war.]{.underline} In late December, a survey by The
Washington Post and the University of Maryland revealed that one in
three Americans think that violence against the government is sometimes
justified. But [**are we really on the brink** of armed conflict or is
it just that the political vitriol makes it feel that way**?** Jay
Ulfelder is a political scientist who studies civil wars and former
research director of the Political Instability Task Force, a U.S.
government-funded program that helps policymakers understand and
anticipate political crises around the globe. Currently a fellow at the
Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard Kennedy School, he spoke
with the Gazette about the prospect of civil war in the
U.S]{.underline}. The interview has been edited for clarity and length.
Q&A Jay Ulfelder GAZETTE: First, how is civil war defined today? Second,
is the country heading down this road? ULFELDER: I'm glad you asked the
definitional question. When anybody asks "Is it going to happen?" my
first response is, "What do you mean by civil war?" The answer depends
tremendously on that. In academic work, [civil war is generally defined
as a violent conflict between two organized, armed groups within a
country that kills at least 1,000 people. Sometimes it's a certain
number of people per year --- usually, in the hundreds --- and where
those people are killed directly by violent clashes between those armed
organized factions.]{.underline} So it matters that we're not talking
about armed troops or police massacring unarmed civilians. One important
thing to know about civil war is that it's very rare. There are civil
wars that last a long time, but onsets of new civil wars are quite rare,
especially in the last several decades. We're usually talking not more
than a few around the world in any given year. And, very importantly,
[almost never in very wealthy countries, and **certainly not in very
wealthy democracies** --- that almost never happens.]{.underline} One of
the rare exceptions is the conflict in Northern Ireland. But that kind
of thing is virtually unheard of in wealthy, ostensible democracies in
the last half-century. "There are so many bad things that can happen
well short of civil war that I wish we, as a country, were talking more
about." [My knee-jerk reaction is that it's really **unlikely to happen
here**. Last year was extraordinary in recent U.S. history in terms of
how politically divided the country is, how violent things got, how
tense they were --- and you still had a number of deaths that was not
anywhere close to civil war. You'd have to see a tremendous escalation
of violence from where we are now to get to what]{.underline} [political
scientists usually think of as civil war.]{.underline} In a way, I think
it's the wrong question. I'm not faulting you for this, because I know
this is the question people are kicking around a lot right now. There's
a tremendous range of things that can happen between where we are now
and what would get construed as civil war. There are so many bad things
that can happen well short of civil war that I wish we, as a country,
were talking more about. GAZETTE: What worries you the most? ULFEDLER:
What really worries me is we absolutely have seen the radicalization of
one of the major political parties in the U.S., both in terms of the
political ideas it's putting forward, but also, its embrace of violence
as a legitimate means to achieve those ends. The rhetoric coming from
the right --- "Watering the tree of liberty with blood," "It's back to
1776" --- Jan. 6 was a reflection of that. [There has been a lot of
small-scale street violence around protest activity in the last couple
of years, especially since the summer of 2020. Also the use of
intimidation to try to push policy agendas and political agendas,
especially at the local level, with people showing up at school board
meetings and county council meetings and threatening people and staging
outside with guns. That's new-ish and it's really bad, especially if you
live in the areas where that is happening. But it's not anywhere close
to civil war. We're getting into this weird space where the variance in
how democratic things are, and how violent things are, is widening and
is now quite large across the country.]{.underline} And that
fragmentation and balkanization of politics, I think, is going to get
worse. That's what really worries me a lot more than, are we going to
get to hundreds of people shooting each other? GAZETTE: Is it a bad sign
that something apolitical like a pandemic became political so quickly?
ULFELDER: Yeah, and that's part of the issue here. I've also heard
people talk about how "If the Democrats could just push forward on
certain kinds of social welfare policies that would help the vulnerable
people who are susceptible to radicalization on the right, that would
solve the problem." They've got the causal arrow going the wrong way.
The radicalization is driving people's response to these things. Even if
you could get those policies passed, I'm super skeptical that people
would suddenly start thinking differently about those things. They would
just move on to the next issue in that "us versus them" narrative that
they're already stuck in. GAZETTE: What can be done to help cool
tensions and stop the country from sliding into further conflict?
ULFELDER: I wish I had a good answer to that. I can point to various
things that I think are part of the cause. One is a constitutional
design problem that disproportionately tips power toward parts of the
country that are most desirous of preserving a white, Christian,
patriarchal order that they think of as the "real America." I also think
social media is quite relevant. The way social media platforms work has
accelerated political radicalization. That's one small piece of it, but
important for people not to lose sight of. Trying to address that aspect
of it may be an important part, long term, of trying to get out of this
hole. Part of the curse of having worked on this topic internationally
for a long time is the knowledge that in situations where politics
becomes factional in this way --- it gets called polarization, but it's
primarily in the U.S. a function of the radicalization of one side, not
both sides equally running away from each other. But polarization or
factionalism tends to be very persistent once it sets in. It's really
hard to get out of it. It takes many years and there's not some obvious
thing that explains why it gets resolved when it does.

### 2nc -- no civil war !

#### No civil war -- civil wars are rare and risk is very low

**Koren 1/2022** (Ore Koren - Assistant Professor of Political Science,
Indiana University. "Civil war in the US is unlikely because grievance
doesn't necessarily translate directly into violence." The Conversation.
January 14, 2022.
https://theconversation.com/civil-war-in-the-us-is-unlikely-because-grievance-doesnt-necessarily-translate-directly-into-violence-174456)

The potential for violent extremism in America to erupt into
full-fledged conflict across the country is a common topic of discussion
nowadays. A 2021 FBI report highlights an increasing risk of violence
against government institutions, private organizations and individuals.
The possible perpetrators: primarily "lone wolves," but potentially also
militias and other organized groups such as animal activists,
anti-abortionists and white supremacists. Claims that America is at the
greatest risk of civil war since, well, the Civil War, recently received
additional support from some experts in the field of political science.
[But **civil wars are rare events**.]{.underline} Before the 2020
election, I analyzed the risk of a so-called "Second American Civil War"
that some speculated might ignite on or around Election Day. [I
concluded the **risk was very low**]{.underline}, while also emphasizing
the uncertainty of the times. Despite the ugly Capitol riot of Jan. 6,
2021, and anti-racism protests of the past few years, some of which
included rioting, violent confrontation, and property destruction, my
analysis has held, and [I remain unconvinced that America is likely to
descend into civil war in the near future]{.underline}. Before
proceeding, I want to stress that, as a scholar who studies civil
conflict, I discuss the manifestations of violence here not on the basis
of their underlying political ideologies but in relation to empirical
definitions of different types of political violence. [**Grievance
doesn't translate into violence**.]{.underline} Researchers usually
define civil wars based on a certain threshold of combatant deaths,
often 1,000 or more. In 2020, for example, only eight conflicts crossed
that threshold worldwide. They happened in countries -- including Syria,
Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Yemen -- experiencing rampant
poverty and underdevelopment, nondemocratic or dysfunctional political
institutions, and a long history of conflict along ethnic and religious
lines. When trying to assess the likelihood of civil war, researchers
first look at whether people are willing to engage in violence.
Willingness is often attributed to anger and grievances over inequality
or political marginalization. Individuals or groups may have grievances
with specific state or national policies, or with other groups. As their
anger grows, these people may not only use aggressive and demeaning
language, but also become more accepting of the idea of using violence.
Anger and grievances are probably the most frequently highlighted issues
in the mainstream media, and especially in social media outlets. Studies
of social media outlets have found that their algorithms are designed to
amplify anger to appeal to wider groups. [Aggrieved people]{.underline},
however, [exist almost everywhere, even in the world's happiest
countries.]{.underline} [Feeling aggrieved]{.underline} and even using
harsh and violent rhetoric [does not mean a person is willing to take up
arms against the government or one's fellow citizens]{.underline}. Risks
to joining a rebellion. But even if they are fully willing, in almost
every case, [civil war will not happen unless these very angry people
have the opportunity to organize and use violence on a large
scale]{.underline}. [**Joining a rebellion is extremely
risky**.]{.underline} You can die or be severely wounded. Your chances
of winning are low. If you don't win, even if you survive unscathed, you
still risk prosecution and social alienation. You may lose your job,
your savings and even your home and put your family at risk. It doesn't
matter how angry you are, these considerations are usually prohibitive.
All these calculations are part of what economists call "opportunity
costs." Opportunity costs basically measure how much you would have to
potentially give up if you were to engage in a given activity, such as
rebellion. In most countries afflicted by civil war, poverty, economic
downturn and even food insecurity mean that these costs are relatively
low. An unemployed farm laborer in rural Mozambique has, from an
economic perspective at least, less to lose from joining an extremist
insurgency than, say, Robert Scott Palmer, owner of a cleaning and
restoration company from Largo, Florida. Apparently willing to risk his
livelihood by using violence against police during the Jan. 6 riot,
Palmer was thwarted by other factors that are highly relevant in
determining the potential for a full-fledged rebellion -- the
government's capacity to punish and deter violence, and the opportunity,
or lack of opportunity, for dissidents to organize and mobilize
effectively enough to start a war. For example, people who want to
organize and rebel against the government will find it easier to do in
remote areas where the government cannot know or reach them. Tora Bora
-- the cave complex in the mountain of eastern Afghanistan -- is an
example of such a place. Insurgents can hide and train there,
practically unknown to, and untouchable by, Afghanistan's military,
which generally lacks the capabilities and capacity of its American
counterpart. The high levels of American policing and intelligence
capacity mean that insurgency opportunities are rare in the U.S.
Individuals who organize, arm themselves and decide to act against the
government risk being detected and thwarted before they can become real
threats. Moreover, [because of the low urban density of the U.S., even
if such rebels are successful in organizing]{.underline} -- in rural
Alaska, for example -- [they will be unable to reach, let alone conquer,
big cities or threaten American sovereignty in significant
ways]{.underline}. 'Intensified domestic terrorism.' [These **low
opportunities** suggest that **civil war in America is still
unlikely**.]{.underline} But this does not preclude the occurrence of
other forms of less intense violence. Concerns about increased violent
extremism in the United States recently led the U.S. Justice Department
to establish a new domestic terrorism group. It is possible we might see
a rise in the number of organized domestic terror attacks -- along the
lines of the British experience during its conflict with the Provisional
Irish Republican Army or the U.S. experience with the Weather
Underground during the 1960s and 1970s

the name itself, as several Mexican fact-checkers were already using
it.) In [Argentina]{.underline}, the Public Defender's Office [launched
the]{.underline} Observatory of Disinformation and Symbolic Violence on
Digital Media and Platforms [(NODIO)]{.underline} in October 2020, [to
"detect, verify, identify and **disarticulate malicious
news**."]{.underline} Critics across the region said the initiative
could be akin to censorship and a few politicians in the opposition
tried unsuccessfully to sue the public defender who created the unit.
**[2. Legislation]{.underline}** The most common response to
misinformation in the region is to try to create legislation to stop it,
said Columbia University researcher Laura Duarte. [In Brazil the
Internet Freedom, Responsibility and Transparency Bill, popularly known
as the "fake news" bill, was approved by the Senate in 2020 and is now
in the lower chamber. The bill aims to **combat the spread of false
information** by making social platforms responsible for **combating
disinformation** and creates an "**internet transparency council**" with
members from government and civil society.]{.underline} After
Venezuela's controversial 2004 Law of Social Responsibility in Radio,
which was followed by a change in the country's penal code in 2005,
several Latin American countries are looking to criminalize the
dissemination of fake news---with sentences of up to 10 years as in
Nicaragua's Special Cyber Crimes Law from 2020. Critics say Venezuela's
and Nicaragua's legislation are effectively tools for political
persecution. Other proposals making fake news a crime are being
discussed in Chile, Colombia, Panama and El Salvador. According to the
International Press Institute, 17 nations globally have passed some form
of regulation targeting disinformation during the pandemic, with many
other bills still pending in legislative bodies. **[3. Working with
social media companies]{.underline}** Several governments are trying to
work with social media companies to tackle the main tools used to spread
fake news. Mexico's National Institute of Elections (INE) signed
collaboration agreements with social media companies prior to the 2018
elections. As part of those accords, INE staff received training on
using and monitoring the Facebook platform, while Google pledged to
disseminate on YouTube information generated by INE about the electoral
process, as well as other initiatives such as marking voting locations
on Google Maps. [Argentina's electoral authority signed a memorandum of
cooperation with Facebook, which pledged to **amplify official electoral
information while curbing the visibility of false posts**. Brazil's
Superior Electoral Court (TSE) also partnered with social media
platforms,]{.underline} with the creation of an official court chatbox
on WhatsApp [where people can **send inquiries about dubious posts
directly to TSE officials**. Another tool allows electoral officials and
WhatsApp to receive and collect information on social media accounts
suspected of spreading messages in bulk, which also violates Facebook's
terms of use. **4. Ethics pacts among political parties**]{.underline}
In Uruguay the six political parties with representatives in Congress
[signed an Ethical Pact Against Disinformation in April 2019, pledging
"not to generate or promote false news or disinformation campaigns to
the detriment of political adversaries]{.underline}." The pact was
proposed by the Uruguayan Press Association as [part of a
**three-pronged campaign against disinformation** that also includes
**training media professionals** and a **fact-checking**
tool.]{.underline} **[5. Media literacy training]{.underline}**
Researchers and specialists are almost unanimous that media literacy
programs are the most effective long-term tool against the dissemination
of fake news. The state of São Paulo in [Brazil included **media
literacy as an elective class** for middle schoolers to help them
recognize what is news and how to check sources]{.underline}.
[Argentina]{.underline}'s fact-checking group Chequeado [put together a
handbook with UNESCO to help train others to spot
disinformation.]{.underline} Outside the region, Finland has introduced
a media literacy program at public schools in 2014 that teaches children
from the age of six to read sources critically. Children are taught to
evaluate and fact-check websites, and hunt for dubious sources. In 2019,
the government of Finland topped the European Media Literacy Index that
measures countries' resistance to misinformation and disinformation.

### 2nc -- disinformation failing now

#### Latin American companies are developing technology that stops the spread of misinformation

**Tameez 5/16** (Hanaa', staff writer at Neiman Lab, "Factchequeado
launches to combat misinformation in Spanish-speaking communities in the
US," Neiman Lab, May 16, 2022,
https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/05/factchequeado-launches-to-combat-misinformation-in-spanish-speaking-communities-in-the-u-s/)-AT

Last month, [Factchequeado launched as a way to address misinformation
in Latino and Spanish-speaking communities in the United
States]{.underline}. Founded by Laura Zommer of Chequeado in Argentina
and Clara Jiménez Cruz of Maldita.es in Spain (both are fact-checking
organizations), The idea for the venture emerged when Jiménez started
noticing that [misinformation in Spanish targeting U.S. Latinos was also
reaching Spanish speakers in Spain]{.underline}. She figured that the
[misinformation must have made its way to Argentina]{.underline} too, so
she reached out to Zommer. "We've been seeing [in Spanish-speaking
countries in the past five to 10 years that misinformation travels in a
different way and very often has specific topics targeting specific
communities]{.underline}," Jiménez said. "So at Maldita, we thought
maybe all these things that we've learned over the years can be
applicable in the U.S. and we can launch \[a\] fact-checking project
there for Spanish speaking communities that can also benefit our own
communities in our own regions. Because we see that this [information
has no borders, this misinformation fabricated in the U.S. comes to
Spain and to Latin America, and misinformation fabricated in Spain and
Latin America is probably reaching the U.S. as well]{.underline}."
Jiménez and Zommer also pointed out that Big Tech companies focus their
efforts and resources on combatting misinformation in English, even
though misinformation on social platforms is a problem in many
languages, including Spanish. That means smaller, sometimes non-profit
fact-checking outlets like Maldita.es and Chequeado shoulder the
responsibility of fact-checking in Spanish. Zommer noted that when the
Plandemic video came out and went viral, Facebook linked in English to
the World Health Organization's website. But with the Spanish version of
the video, Facebook linked to a group called "Médicos por la verdad"
(Doctors for Truth), which disseminates misinformation about issues
related to the coronavirus. "One of our approaches here is thinking if
we manage \[to get\] platforms and the companies to put attention into
Spanish-language misinformation in the U.S., that is going to benefit
our regions and our languages in the long term," Jiménez said.
Factchequeado, a team of five, is a service journalism project and its
model is based on collaboration. It partners with English- and
Spanish-language publications in the U.S. that want to republish its
fact-checks and explainers. In return, Factchequeado asks that the
organizations help them reach broader audiences and learn more about
their news and information consumption habits by sharing its WhatsApp
chatbot number. So far, Factchequeado's partners are Conecta Arizona,
Conexión Migrante, Documented, El Detector, Enlace Latino NC,
FactCheck.org, La Esquina, MediaWise, PolitiFact, and Telemundo's
Verifica. [Factchequeado determines what to debunk with two factors:
virality and level of danger.]{.underline} Its team won't cover
something that only one person forwarded them on WhatsApp if the reach
of the content in question is low because doing so could lead to
amplification. [It will also focus on misinformation that surfaces in
times of crisis, social movements, and elections]{.underline}. Since its
launch, Factchequeado has covered cryptocurrency scams and how to
protect yourself from them, fake polls about Mexican president Andrés
Manuel López Obrador, the Amber Heard and Johnny Depp trial, and what
will happen to abortion access if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe
v. Wade. Spanish speakers in the U.S., of course, aren't a monolith.
Jiménez and Zommer know that different communities in different regions
have all kinds of interests and consumption habits, and that WhatsApp is
commonly used among Spanish speakers around the world. In
Factchequeado's pilot year, they want to quantify that information more
and understand where certain narratives come from, how they get to
certain communities, and what the takeaways from those findings are in
order to better combat misinformation in Spanish. Then they can show how
tech companies answer misinformation and disinformation in Spanish
differently than they do in English, Zommer said. But to get all that
information, building relationships with news consumers and social media
users is key. "One of the approaches that Maldita and Chequeado have
taken throughout their time is the idea of building trust by doing the
public a service," Jiménez said. "What we do on a daily basis is listen
to the audiences, understand what their needs are and try to answer
them. Once they trust us, we can start \[giving them\] other kinds of
information that is not necessarily the one that they \[came to us
for\]." Factchequeado plans to experiment with different formats to
reach users as well, something that Chequeado and Maldita already do.
Many of Factchequeado's stories start with, "if you only have a few
minutes, read this" and a few bullets that summarize the piece. Most
people likely don't have or want to spend the time reading 2,000 word
articles, but they do have 20 seconds to understand that something is
false. They'll test out shorter pieces, images, short videos and audio
files to see what what resonates most with its users. Its tone gives
more "friend telling you something at the bar" vibes instead of
"journalist trying to explain the world at you," Jiménez said. "We as
journalists often \[face\] pieces of misinformation that we might not
think are super important or that they're going to make us win a
Pulitzer," Jiménez said. "But they're the ones that build trust within
communities because you answer the questions that they have and
afterwards, they will stay for the rest."

[Despite the Biden administration's efforts to outline a new, positive
vision for engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean, **old fault
lines** are likely **to come into play** **at** the upcoming **Summit of
the Americas**]{.underline}, which kicks off in Los Angeles on June 6.
[Both U.S. domestic politics and governments in the hemisphere with a
more **skeptical view of Washington and its intentions contribute to
these tensions**]{.underline}. A new U.S. perspective is required ---
one that takes into greater account the region's diversity, priorities
and political complexity. Without such a shift, [the **perception and
reality of declining U.S. influence** are only]{.underline} likely [to
deepen]{.underline}. The tri-annual regional summit is in trouble. [The
heads-of-state of Mexico, Brazil, many Caribbean countries and other
nations are threatening to boycott]{.underline} --- largely, but not
only, [because of the exclusion of Cuba, Nicaragua and
Venezuela]{.underline}. While the [softening of sanctions]{.underline}
legislation [on Cuba and Venezuela is]{.underline} welcome in the
region, it's [being viewed as a belated effort to respond to concern
over their exclusion.]{.underline} Whether or not a widespread boycott
of the summit ultimately materializes, the **[stresses in U.S-regional
relations]{.underline}** will **[have been exposed in an unflattering
light]{.underline}**. Observers and analysts are also pointing to
[longer-term concerns over U.S. policy]{.underline} in the region,
[including decreased U.S. influence and interest; growing regional ties
with China; the failure to check Ortega's Nicaragua, Maduro's Venezuela
and Cuba; and the "ambivalence toward democracy" and the "pink tide"
trend in Latin American elections]{.underline}. The administration is
responding. Secretary of State Antony Blinken presented an ambitious set
of objectives in a May 3 speech to the Council of the Americas focused
on "growth with equity." The assistant secretary for the region, Brian
Nichols, has mentioned reaching agreements on "clean energy transition,
a green future, and digital transformation." First lady Jill Biden
visited Ecuador on May 19 and spoke about "achieving an equitable and
sustainable future, building health and pandemic resilience, and
strengthening democratic government" in the region. The importance of
like-minded nations working with Washington should not be discounted.
The summit could yet be salvaged. Despite promises of a wider agenda,
however, [**issues like irregular migration, nearshoring** **and** the
state of **regional democracy** may dominate at the summit and will
likely be perceived as Washington setting priorities]{.underline}. Most
Latin American and Caribbean governments are concentrating instead on
post-COVID pandemic measures to restart their economies and address the
problems created by slow growth, inequality and political fragmentation.
[The **summit** in Los Angeles is **unlikely to resolve these
differences**]{.underline}. The uncertainties surrounding the summit,
however, are a wake-up call for the United States. Like the last period
of serious redefinition of our hemispheric relations at the end of the
Cold War in 1989, when Washington forged closer ties with a newly
democratic hemisphere, the U.S.-Latin American relationship going
forward must evolve.

### 2nc - US relationship with Latin America low

#### America's attempt to re-establish leadership in Latin America is failing now -- too many hurdles

**Liptak 6/8** (Kevin, news reporter at CNN that covers the White House,
and he previously covered Trump's foreign and domestic policy, campaign
politics, and the internal dynamics of the administration, "Snubs from
key leaders at Summit of the Americas reveal Biden's struggle to assert
US leadership in its neighborhood," CNN, Wednesday, June 8, 2022,
https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/politics/summit-of-the-americas-joe-biden/index.html)-AT

Biden, who arrives in Los Angeles on Wednesday, is expected announce a
new partnership with countries in the Western Hemisphere during the
gathering as part of a broader effort to stabilize the region, according
to the officials. He and his administration have been working since last
year to organize the summit, which was formally announced last August.
The city of Los Angeles was selected as the venue in January. Biden
named former Sen. Chris Dodd, his friend and former colleague on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as the special adviser for the
event. Dodd traveled in the region to muster support, one of a number of
administration envoys to Central and South America that included Vice
President Kamala Harris and even first lady Jill Biden. Yet [as the
summit approached, it became evident **an event designed to reassert
American leadership in the region was facing serious
hurdles**]{.underline}. For weeks before the summit began, [López
Obrador hinted that he would **boycott** unless all leaders from the
region were invited -- including those from Cuba, Nicaragua and
Venezuela, each of whom has faced US opposition because of their human
rights records. Other, mostly leftist leaders signaled they, too, may
not attend if invitations did not go to everyone.]{.underline}
Administration officials privately cast doubt those leaders would follow
through on their threats, suggesting they were instead attempts to play
to domestic audiences that are often skeptical of the United States.
During an April telephone call between Biden and López Obrador, the
subject of the summit arose. In a readout, the White House said the men
"looked forward to meeting again at the June Summit of the Americas," a
sign the administration believed then the Mexican president would
attend. Over the past weeks, Dodd spent lengthy virtual sessions
lobbying López Obrador to reconsider his threat of a boycott. Members of
Congress -- including Sen. Bob Menendez, Democratic chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- began to publicly agitate against
inviting any leaders from Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua. And frustration
mounted among administration officials that questions over the
invitations and attendees were clouding out the summit's intended goals.
"The biggest problem is that the focus on attendance takes us away from
the focus on substance, but that is the logical thing that happens ahead
of a summit. It's like the sausage-making period. We don't talk much
about the substance because the summit hasn't started yet, we talk only
about who might be there," said Roberta Jacobson, the former US
ambassador to Mexico who also served as an adviser to Biden on southern
border policy. Ultimately, the weeks of speculation were put to rest ---
but not in the way the White House had hoped. ["There cannot be a Summit
of the Americas if all countries of the Americas cannot attend," López
Obrador said]{.underline} at a news conference in Mexico City. ["This is
to continue the old interventionist policies, of lack of respect for
nations and their people."]{.underline}

### 1nc -- no Russia influence

#### Russia won't be able to form relations with South America - too distracted now

First, the United States needs to raise the price of engaging with
Russia in the region. The longer this crisis lasts, the more Russia will
look for friends wherever it can find them, both for diplomatic support
and for assistance in dodging the sanctions. A full-court diplomatic
press will be required to ensure Moscow doesn't find any new supporters.
It is possible that harsh Western sanctions on Russia might help some
Latin American countries (e.g., Venezuela) in terms of commodity prices
like oil, but it is more likely that the crisis will drive inflationary
pressures and economic disruptions in the region. The United States,
Europe, Canada, and others should seek to bolster the region with
economic assistance to countries particularly hard hit by sanctions
backlash. The United States should also increase its engagement in the
OAS and consider a capital increase for the Inter-American Development
Bank. [The crisis will also impact how the United States uses the Summit
of the Americas that it is hosting in June in Los Angeles. Second, Putin
may be bluffing, but he could deploy forces to the region.]{.underline}
Russia has threatened to send military assets to the Western Hemisphere
during this crisis. With oil at \$100 a barrel, Putin will have
resources at his disposal, but sanctions may also curb his ability to
spend this money. If the crisis in Ukraine drags on and Russia sees
U.S.-led sanctions as tantamount to "acts of war," Putin might try
anything. Strong statements to the Kremlin from the United States and
its allies that they will oppose such deployments will be required. On
the other hand, [the invasion of Ukraine may leave **Russia too
distracted**, **too economically weak, or too overstretched to
effectively assist client states such as Nicaragua, Cuba, or
Venezuela**.]{.underline} Third, the United States should be prepared
for a change in leadership in Moscow or a Kyiv quagmire scenario that
causes Russia to disengage with the Western Hemisphere. The United
States should be ready to fill a void left by a weakened Russia so that
China does not fill that void instead.

### 2nc -- no Russia influence

#### Growing opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Latin America

**Ostos 4/22** (Claudia Gago Ostos - Research Intern, State Resilience
and Fragility Program. "How Russia's Invasion of Ukraine Affects Latin
America." Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy. April 7, 2022.
https://newlinesinstitute.org/russia/how-russias-invasion-of-ukraine-affects-latin-america/)

Until Russia invaded Ukraine, Washington seemed to pay little attention
to Russian influence in Latin America. However, [with growing
international **opposition** to Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}, and the decline in Moscow's reliability as an ally
for the Latin American countries, the U.S. appears more interested in
regaining diplomatic terrain in the region. In recent weeks, [Washington
approached the Venezuelan government about restarting the oil
trade]{.underline}, a highly controversial decision within the U.S.
government, and met with Colombian President Iván Duque over giving
Colombia a non-NATO ally status -- a status only Argentina and Brazil
currently hold in the region. On March 2, [141 countries voted in favor
of the non-binding resolution by the U.N. General Assembly to condemn
Russia's aggression against Ukraine and demand a **withdrawal** of
Russian troops from Ukrainian territory]{.underline}. Out of the
remaining 52 member states, 35 abstained and five voted against the
resolution. These five were: Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Russia, and
Syria. Out of the 35 that abstained, we find longstanding Russian allies
like Cuba, Nicaragua, and China. More interestingly, Bolivia and El
Salvador were also among the Latin American countries that abstained.
Other member countries were unable to vote on the matter; Venezuela
could not vote because it had not paid its membership dues. [Russia's
decision to invade Ukraine left Latin American countries in a difficult
position.]{.underline} Most followed Mexico and Brazil's course: The two
countries declined to impose economic sanctions on Russia or condemn the
Russian invasion. They also have no concrete plans to cut diplomatic
ties, even though their representatives voted in favor of the U.N.
Resolution. [Brazil and Mexico have expressed their concerns over how
sanctions could affect their own economies.]{.underline} Brazil imports
more fertilizers from Russia than any other country; 69 percent of
Brazil's fertilizers are imported from Russia. After Brazil, Mexico is
the second most important partner for Russia in Latin America. According
to Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry, Russia was Mexico's 35th largest
trading partner in 2020, with two-way trade worth just under \$1.3
billion. Russian products accounted for two-thirds of that amount. Even
if these countries will not sanction Russia themselves, sanctions from
companies and trading partners mean they will need to find other trading
partners to substitute the goods they import from Russia in order to
satisfy their internal demands. On the other side, Cuba, Nicaragua, and
Venezuela supported Russia's actions in Ukraine and blamed the crisis on
the U.S. and NATO, as was expected. After all, Russia shares more than
military and trade deals with these countries; Russia's financial system
has been an essential enabler in Venezuela and Nicaragua's sanctions
evasion efforts in recent years. [With **Russian financial institutions
now cut off**, these countries could face additional economic challenges
in the coming months.]{.underline} Furthermore, for Russia, these Latin
American allies represent critical components in its efforts to
establish a long-term security threat for the U.S. by continuously
stating that depending on how the U.S. and NATO to act near its border,
Russia will engage its allies in the region via unspecified
"military-technical measures." Despite Moscow's influence in Latin
America, [the U.S. and China have far more significant ties to the
region]{.underline}. In 2019, for example, South American exports to
Russia amounted to \$5 billion, but exports to the U.S. and China were
\$66 billion and \$119 billion, respectively, according to data compiled
by Harvard University. Russia's specialty in the region has been
political support for countries becoming isolated on the global stage
and defense assistance, [but that support may soon lose its value with
**Russia's diplomatic isolation and economic decline**.]{.underline}
Likewise, if Moscow's key allies in the region decide to abandon their
relationship with Russia, Cuba and Nicaragua are likely to suffer the
worst because of sanctions, but they would still have close economic
ties with China to rely on. For now, they act as proxies that Russia can
leverage against the U.S. because of their geostrategic proximity to the
U.S. and military alliances with Russia. Although Venezuela plays a
similar role, Maduro is uniquely positioned to exploit the current
situation. With the U.S. banning Russian oil imports, it has turned to
Venezuela after almost three years without any diplomatic relations, and
Maduro's administration seems eager to begin talks. Nonetheless, [it is
up to the United States to take Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an
opportunity to enhance its alliances with Latin American]{.underline}
(and European) partners. Washington will also have to navigate the
challenge of incoming leaders, as Colombia, Costa Rica, and Brazil face
elections this year. With the Summit of the Americas taking place in Los
Angeles in June this year, [Washington has a unique opportunity to
further push this goal, guide Latin American countries in this changing
economic landscape, and use new opportunities to spread democracy and
development in the region.]{.underline}

#### Latin American countries are resistant to Russia's efforts to gain influence in the region -- the invasion of Ukraine was a wake-up call 

**Runde 3/22** (Daniel F. Runde - Senior Vice President; William A.

Given the global revulsion toward Russia's unprovoked invasion of
Ukraine, governments in Latin America and the Caribbean should rethink
their relationship with Vladimir Putin's Russia. There should be a price
to pay electorally, diplomatically, and commercially for being too close
to Putin. It is likely that the significant sanctions on Russia will
have spillover effects on Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua---the three
countries closest to Russia in the region. [The brutality of this
invasion should make Argentina and Brazil, two countries flirting with
Putin, **think twice about a deeper partnership with the Kremlin**. The
rest of the region should see **Russia's invasion as a wake-up call**
and **reduce their ties** in the coming weeks and months.]{.underline}
In recent years, Russia brought its "Kremlin playbook" to the Western
Hemisphere, interfering in elections not only in the United States but
also in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. Russia, through
overt and covert means, has sought to undermine democratic processes by
subverting, delegitimizing, or otherwise frustrating the political
opposition in much the same way that Russia attempted to influence the
United States' 2016 and 2020 elections. Russia Today (known as RT) has a
major presence in Latin America in Spanish, not only on television,
which remains a major source of information in the region, but also via
digital platforms. If RT is not providing disinformation, it is at the
very least providing Kremlin propaganda. Russia seeks to project
military power in the region in an attempt to "balance" NATO's own
eastward movement into Russia's "near abroad." Russia has a consistent
presence in the region in the form of listening posts, special forces
deployments, and military and intelligence training and support. Russia
has periodically deployed strategic bombers and naval forces in the
hemisphere to remind the United States and its allies in the region that
it too can project power in the hemisphere. Russia has offered its
Sputnik V vaccine in a number of countries on the continent. The vaccine
is not as effective as Western vaccines or even those offered by China.
However, if Guatemala, led by a friend of the United States, must wait
at the back of the line for the "top-shelf" vaccines made in the United
States or Europe, then Guatemala is going to buy the Sputnik V vaccine
or remain unvaccinated. The leftist governments in Peru, Chile, and
Bolivia (and possibly incoming governments in Colombia and Brazil) would
have been tempted to be more "Putin curious" in the past. **[Working
with Putin should now become untenable]{.underline}**, [especially for
those governments that lead with a human rights platform.]{.underline}
Russia will likely seek diplomatic or material support from the region
and will likely work with actors in the region to try to work around
sanctions. Russia has sought to build a collective resistance to
sanctions. For example, with the help of China, as well as Russia and
Iran, Venezuela's oil company, PDVSA, has successfully sold millions of
barrels of "sanctioned" oil via tankers primarily destined for China and
with financial support from Russia. Countries under sanctions in the
Western Hemisphere know that they can count on help from their allies
when sanctions are imposed. For example, Maduro routinely ships
sanctioned oil and diesel (and even food) to Cuba while his own people
remain undernourished. Russia has spent years trying to create an
alternative to SWIFT that Russia's partners in the region could adopt to
erode the West's ability to influence behavior through financial sector
sanctions. As the SWIFT sanctions bite in Russia, expect to see Russia's
allies join a Russia-led alternative to SWIFT.

### 1nc -- sanctions fail

#### Sanctions won't solve - Ukraine proves

**Jones 22** (Lee Jones is Professor of Political Economy and
International Relations at Queen Mary University of London., "Sanctions
won't save Ukraine", UnHerd, February 28, 2022,
https://unherd.com/2022/02/sanctions-wont-save-ukraine/)

Unsurprisingly, the West has decided it won't send its sons and
daughters to die for Ukraine. Instead, it hopes to cripple Russia with
economic sanctions. Will such measures bring about the end of the
Russian invasion? Will Vladimir Putin scuttle back to the Kremlin with
his tail between his legs? It seems unlikely. As the [record of
international conflict shows, **sanctions rarely (if ever)
work**]{.underline}. To succeed, sanctions must not only impose economic
costs --- they must also change the political behaviour of target
governments. Neither is at all straightforward. As the past week has
shown, [designing sanctions that will harm Russia but not other European
economies is fiendishly difficult]{.underline}. So far, only modest
measures have been imposed: primarily asset freezes and exclusion from
the Swift payments system for some banks; asset seizures and travel bans
for some elites and oligarchs; and limits on Aeroflot flights. [**None
of these will cripple Russia's economy**, despite fanciful claims by
Western leaders]{.underline}. The proposed sanctions on Russia's central
bank [[may cut much
deeper]{.underline}](https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/592272-to-prevent-an-invasion-of-ukraine-threaten-to-sanction-russias).
Exactly how far these will go is not yet clear. But freezing Russia's
overseas currency reserves will make it harder for the central bank to
defend the value of the rouble, and to supply foreign exchange for
commercial banks. This is unlikely to collapse the economy, as some
advocates
[[suggest]{.underline}](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/how-russian-sanctions-work/622940/),
but it could have significant and far-reaching consequences, including
runs on Russian banks and impediments to foreign trade. However, it's
precisely the threat to trade that will probably lead Western
governments to avoid a total freeze --- limiting Russia's access to
foreign exchange, but not severing it entirely. The reason is simple[:
Russia is not a minor economy. Western countries, firms and banks do a
lot of business with Russia.]{.underline} [Wide-ranging sanctions will
naturally have blowback. This is why tougher measures will be difficult,
if not impossible]{.underline}, to impose. The real "nuclear" option
would be to embargo Russia's energy exports, which comprise over half of
Russia's total exports. This would inflict serious damage. But, given
that Europe relies on Russia for about a quarter of its oil and over a
third of its gas, it would also spur massive inflation and induce
economic recession in the West. Prices have [[already
spiked]{.underline}](https://www.ft.com/content/c6303127-5edf-4256-9c25-effa75766002)
due to the conflict, which will further harm households reeling from
record-high energy prices. It's telling, for example, that [Germany has
"de-certified" the Nordstream-2 pipeline, but not the pipelines through
which it receives existing supplies.]{.underline} [Likewise, Western
governments appear [unable to
agree](https://www.ft.com/content/69f72de5-d727-496d-9f9d-316db7bdaf03) on
completely blocking Russia from Swift, because this would create
difficulties for Russian and Western banks alike.]{.underline} Without
Swift, how would Germany pay for Russian gas? And, if it cannot pay,
would the gas keep flowing? How would the many other Western businesses
working in or dealing with Russia make payments? For the same reason,
although some sectors of the Russian economy, such as chemicals and
automobiles, rely on imported hi-tech Western components, so far, export
restrictions remain limited, for fear of damaging Western firms. Despite
their belligerent rhetoric, Western leaders are wary of creating more
problems for economies already struggling to recover from the deep
recessions caused by their Covid-19 lockdowns. They are quietly carving
out even non-critical economic sectors, such as [[luxury goods and
diamond
exports]{.underline}](https://fashionunited.com/news/business/italy-s-luxury-sector-and-belgium-s-diamond-leaders-say-no-to-russian-sanctions/2022022546111),
from the sanction regime. It is hard to avoid the impression that,
having blundered into confrontation with Russia, Western governments are
now realising they have very limited options, and remain reluctant to
put their money where their mouths are. However[, even if the West can
find ways to inflict serious economic damage on Russia, that still does
not mean sanctions will "work"]{.underline}. To be truly effective,
[they must also change the Russian government's behaviour]{.underline}.
And this is where [the **logic of sanctions [often breaks
down](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198749325.001.0001/acprof-9780198749325)**.]{.underline}
It is remarkably rare for Western policymakers to explain --- or even
consider --- exactly how "economic pain" is supposed to translate into
"political gain". And the prospects in this particular case do not look
promising. The fundamental problem is that [sanctions are **based on a
dubious understanding of human behaviour**. They are a quintessentially
liberal instrument, resting on the assumption that every man has his
price: if I impose economic costs on you, you will revise the
cost-benefit analysis of your course of action, and change your
behaviour accordingly]{.underline}. In the real world, however, [many
regimes and their supporters are willing to endure colossal economic
costs to pursue their political and security goals.]{.underline} [Saddam
Hussein's Ba'ath Party regime
[preferred](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Societies_Under_Siege/DcOPCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)
to see Iraq's economy and society destroyed rather than relinquish
power. Fidel Castro's regime withstood a punishing US embargo for
decades. Iran has suffered serious economic harm under Western sanctions
without relinquishing its nuclear programme]{.underline}. What are
Putin's goals in Ukraine? The Russian government has made it clear since
the early Noughties that it cannot tolerate the eastward expansion of
Nato, considering it a serious threat to Russian security. Its invasion
of Georgia in 2008, and its attacks on [[Ukraine in
2014]{.underline}](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2014-08-18/why-ukraine-crisis-west-s-fault),
long ago demonstrated the Kremlin's determination to prevent
neighbouring countries falling into the Western orbit, even at the cost
of international isolation and punitive sanctions. One does not need to
sympathise with Putin at all to recognise that Russia's bank balance is
not his primary consideration. [If Putin will not put economic costs
ahead of his security goals, how else might sanctions work?]{.underline}
Classically, comprehensive embargoes seemed to be guided by a "[[naïve
theory]{.underline}](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2009785)" of
sanctions, whereby economic suffering is expected to compel the
population to rise up against their wicked leaders. But this rarely, if
ever, happens. If anything, **[economic immiseration tends to fragment
and weaken the population, who become absorbed by the struggle to
subsist and more reliant on government help]{.underline}** --- [[as seen
in
Iraq]{.underline}](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Societies_Under_Siege/DcOPCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0).
Targeted sanctions work on an equally naïve basis, assuming that
political leaders and their business cronies are completely autonomous
from the people, such that manipulating their personal wealth will
convince them to change course. In truth, political leaders always
represent some broader set of forces in their regime and wider society.
Their policies reflect that underlying coalition. If they change course,
they will have to answer to their supporters. Vladimir [Putin is a
powerful and quasi-authoritarian leader, but he is not autonomous from
Russian society.]{.underline} His rise reflects a broadly-based
nationalist backlash against the consequences of neoliberal "shock
therapy" practised on Russia by the International Monetary Fund after
the collapse of the Soviet Union. Under the pro-Western President
Yeltsin, the public wealth built up under communism was pillaged by
oligarchs, while the Russian people suffered astonishing levels of
deprivation. In the [[decade to
1998]{.underline}](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v29/n02/perry-anderson/russia-s-managed-democracy),
GDP fell by 45%, mortality increased by 50%, government revenues had
nearly halved, and crime had doubled. Putin rose to power by promising
to halt and reverse Russia's national decline. In his first seven years
in office, real wages
[[doubled]{.underline}](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v29/n02/perry-anderson/russia-s-managed-democracy)
(albeit from a low base). Using soaring oil revenues, Putin stabilised
the economy and paid off foreign debt, reasserting Russia's sovereignty.
He brought the oligarchs to heel, jailing or exiling anyone who would
not recognise the state's supremacy. And he restored stability and a
measure of national pride to an exhausted and demoralised people. His
regime, centred on a network of *siloviki* (security and military
officials) and managers of state-owned enterprises, has proven
politically robust and durable --- a state within the state. This is
important not to praise or exonerate Putin, but to understand why his
popularity has remained high, even under sanctions. [[Experimental
research]{.underline}](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022343319866879)
suggests that Russia's economic decline since 2014 --- mostly caused by
declining oil prices, though compounded by sanctions --- has cost Putin
some support. But it has been more than compensated for by an upsurge in
nationalist backing. Putin's [[approval
rating]{.underline}](https://www.levada.ru/en/ratings/) increased from
65% in January 2014 to 86% in April 2014, following the annexation of
Crimea. It remained above 80% for the next two years before returning to
the high 60s. Today, [a [large
majority](https://www.levada.ru/2021/12/14/obostrenie-v-donbasse/) of
Russians blame the West for the crisis in Ukraine]{.underline}, while
[[two-thirds](https://www.levada.ru/en/2022/01/28/anti-russian-sanctions/)
have little or no concern about sanctions]{.underline}. Putin's regime
may have persecuted opposition figures, curbed dissent, and restricted
electoral competition --- but, despite such authoritarian measures, he
retains widespread support. Western leaders could only dream of his
approval ratings: support for Biden stands at
[[42%]{.underline}](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/),
for Macron,
[[40%]{.underline}](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/france/),
and, for Boris Johnson, just
[[25%]{.underline}](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/boris-johnson-approval-rating).
Nor is there much sign of political fracture within the regime that
sanctions could exploit. Putin's ability to [[publicly
humiliate]{.underline}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucEs0nBuowE) his
spy chief, who bodged his lines at the televised, stage-managed security
council meeting prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, suggests he feels
secure and confident. The overwhelming vote in the Duma of [[400 to
zero]{.underline}](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/duma-manouevre-points-to-kremlin-impatience-in-ukraine-standoff)
in favour of recognising the breakaway "republics" of Donetsk and
Luhansk suggests either broad elite consensus or an unwillingness to
openly defy the Kremlin. Exactly how the (modest) economic pain caused
by sanctions is meant to generate political gain is therefore hard to
discern. All too often, sanctions are a comforting but dangerous
illusion: they are alluring because they seem to provide an effective
option between war and words. When diplomacy seems to fail, and states
are unwilling to risk war, something else is needed --- and that
something is sanctions. But just because something must be done does not
mean that this "something" is going to work. Moreover, it is all too
easy to forget that [**embargoes are a weapon of war**, often
**devastating** target **populations** and **escalating** **conflicts**,
rather than peacefully resolving them. In response to the latest
sanctions, Putin [has put Russia's nuclear forces on high
alert](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/vladimir-putin-puts-russia-nuclear-deterrence-forces-on-high-alert-ukraine)]{.underline}.
It seems unlikely that he would deploy them in response to banking
sanctions. But this is a reminder of that the stakes are incredibly
high. Ultimately, even if sanctions do bite, we need to ask: what is the
endgame? Sanctions are at best a means to an end, and surely the desired
end is lasting peace in Eastern Europe. And one does not need to have
any sympathy whatsoever with the Putin regime to believe that this can
only be achieved by reckoning with core Russian interests. Like it or
not, powerful states have the capacity to inflict serious harm on weaker
ones --- just ask the Serbs, Libyans, Afghans, Iraqis and Syrians on the
receiving end of the Nato powers' tender mercies. If Russia is
dissatisfied, it clearly has the power to upset the existing order by
force. The only way to prevent this is to compromise with Russia's
concerns, or deploy overwhelming force to deter it from using its
military power. The West has done neither, dismissing Putin's demands to
establish a neutral buffer zone between Russia and Nato, while failing
to deter him from using force to achieve his objectives. The only way
out of this disaster is a negotiated settlement, which will require Nato
to reckon with Russian interests, and preserve Ukrainian democracy and
sovereignty within a framework of international neutrality. For the
brutal reality is this: sanctions are unlikely to force Russia out of
Ukraine, and the West is unwilling to be drawn directly into battle with
a nuclear-armed state. Unless a diplomatic solution can be found,
sanctions are likely to be merely part of a grinding proxy war along the
lines of the brutal and horrific conflict in Syria. The people of
Ukraine have already suffered too much. Sanctions won't save them ---
they may only make their misery worse.

### 2nc -- sanctions fail

#### **US sanctions don't solve -- they are flawed and Russian foreign policy won't change**

commentator for U.S. News & World Report. "Why Sanctions on Russia Won't
Work." Time. Febuary 23, 2022.
https://time.com/6150607/why-sanctions-on-russia-wont-work/)

As the U.S. and Europe roll out an arsenal of economic sanctions to
combat Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [there is scant understanding that
the financial interdependence of the crisis's significant players means
quick and easy solutions are unlikely to work]{.underline}. Worse
still[, imposing sanctions on Russia's elite will do little if anything
to bring order]{.underline} to what has fast-become chaotic. Putin in
the Sanctions Crosshairs Nevertheless, news earlier this week that
Russia ordered its military to take a "peacekeeping" role in disputed
regions of eastern Ukraine, prompted the western democracies to impose
sanctions on Russia. Specifically, the U.S., U.K., and other countries
slapped penalties on specific Russian companies and people. In the U.S.,
the sanctions list included some Russian banks and wealthy individuals
and oligarchs. Plus, there's a ban on purchasing the country's debt. In
short, these actions are aimed at hurting the rich and powerful in
Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle. [The problem is that
few experts think these actions will make much difference.]{.underline}
"So far, we've seen timid sanctions," says Peter Tchir, head of global
macro strategy at New York-based financial firm Academy Securities.
"Sanctions only work when they force behavior change, but in Putin's
case they won't." As it was under the Czars, the issue in Russia now is
that the population is mainly poor -- with average annual per capita
income around one fifth of that in the U.S. Just a few ultra-wealthy
individuals sit at the top of the economic pyramid. Ultimately, the
poverty-stricken will feel the bite of sanctions far more than the
elite. "Russia has always treated the poor as peasants," Tchir says.
Poor History of Sanctions Success [Other **experts see more significant
flaws in imposing sanctions**]{.underline}. ["The record of those
actions is that **they fail**,"]{.underline} says Steve Hanke, professor
of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. ["There are **always
workarounds**," meaning sanctions won't stop the rich from getting money
in or out of the country]{.underline}. [Indeed, Russia has been subject
to sanctions for years dating back at least as far as the
2014]{.underline} annexation of Crimea---[and **the behavior of the
country has not changed in a positive way since then**.]{.underline} As
with the recently introduced penalties, the past sanctions were
surgically applied to hit the elites. Other countries have also
weathered severe sanctions without improving their behavior. Hanke notes
that U.S. sanctions on Venezuela haven't pushed out the country's
authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro. Similar actions against Cuba
didn't get rid of dictator Fidel Castro. Likewise, Iran's theocratic
mullahs remain in charge despite more than four decades of harsh U.S.
measures against the regime. The issue is that sanctions often prompt a
country's population to rally around the flag. "Whoever is imposing the
sanctions are viewed as the enemy," Hanke says. Put another way, a siege
mentality takes over with people banding together to weather the
economic storm.

Culminating in former U.S. President Donald Trump's "maximum pressure"
campaign, these **[\[Iran\] sanctions, in short, have been a
failure]{.underline}**. The **[humanitarian costs of the
sanctions]{.underline}** [have been staggering]{.underline}, and
**[Iran's civil society and middle class]{.underline}** have had to pay
a dear price, be it in the **[form of disenfranchisement from medicine,
safe aviation, international mobility, educational opportunities, and
COVID-19 vaccines, or their shrinking purchasing power, mushrooming
poverty, and a currency that lost 70 percent of its value since Trump
walked away from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018]{.underline}**. It is
[difficult to gauge the total damage Iran has incurred from the
sanctions]{.underline}, because the oil-dependent economy is diminishing
over time, and there are various components that should be [factored
into the country's economic freefall, including corruption,
mismanagement, nepotism, lack of transparency, and bureaucratic
labyrinths, in addition to sanctions]{.underline}. However, last year,
then-Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif acknowledged U.S.
sanctions have imposed damages on the national economy adding up to \$1
trillion. Yet although Iranian citizens have been at the end of their
tether with a strained economy and lives that are becoming increasingly
untenable, occasionally prompting them to storm the streets and stage
anti-government protests, the **[formidable sanctions have done little
to change the government's overall behavior and policies]{.underline}**,
and there are those who suggest they even have produced a counterforce
by radicalizing Tehran's regional conduct and nuclear priorities. In
particular, in the aftermath of Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear
deal, **[Iran accelerated its race to new nuclear thresholds and reneged
on its commitments under the deal by enriching uranium to 20 percent and
60 percent, and even going the extra mile to produce metal
uranium.]{.underline}** These are some basic indications that the
economic pressure has backfired and, instead of having a bearing on the
government or coaxing it into diplomacy, has merely decimated a
vulnerable middle class that is admittedly the sacrificial lamb in an
ongoing vendetta involving Iran and the world powers. Further evidence
of this assumption is [Iran's risky escalations in the Persian Gulf,
targeting of Saudi Arabia's oil facilities through its Houthi proxies,
and nearly going to war with the United States after showering the Ain
al-Asad air base]{.underline} in Iraq's Anbar province with missiles in
retaliation for the assassination of its top commander Qassem Suleimani
in January 2020. These developments can be read as the **[failure of the
sanctions regime]{.underline}**: The government in Tehran has learned
how to survive---to find workarounds to dodge the sanctions, sneak into
the black market, empower the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to keep
the national economy afloat---and has emerged resilient while the United
States exhausts its options. **[In 2016, then-U.S. Treasury Secretary
Jacob Lew warned that the overuse of sanctions against adversaries will
water down their effectiveness and chip away at the United States'
leadership role]{.underline}**. [Russia bears many hallmarks of Iran's
authoritarian governance model]{.underline}. Its democratic credentials
are scant, there is little willingness to open up to the world and show
transparency and accountability, and civil liberties and social rights
are not guaranteed. **[Russia is also a major world power, and with an
annual defense expenditure of \$61.7 billion as of 2020, and it boasts

arms and exports a massive quantity, including fighter jets, to
traditional customers. Draconian **[sanctions]{.underline}**,
divestment, and embargoes, however inclusive and pungent, **[will not
bring such a militarized juggernaut as Russia to its knees or deter it
from further aggression in Ukraine,]{.underline}** nor will they stave
off its hypothetical prospective adventures in Europe, if there are
indeed any (including the idea of invading Poland, raised by Andrii
Deshchytsia, Ukraine's ambassador to Poland).

[**Putin seems willing to tolerate the economic and financial

the eastern Donbas region, having largely given up their campaign in the
north after weeks without progress. Putin would no doubt like to claim
at least a partial win by May 9, when Russia marks its victory day in
World War II. [Moscow has also streamlined its military leadership in
Ukraine under one commander.]{.underline} **[So far the only thing that
has slowed Putin down has been his military's fumbles in northern
Ukraine. Weapons sent by Europe and the U.S.,]{.underline}** especially
anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, have proven a boon for the
Ukrainian forces mounting fierce resistance on the ground. As Foreign
Minister Dmytro Kuleba said last week, **[Ukraine needs three things:

to send more offensive arms including tanks]{.underline}**, though
fighter jets may still be off the table. NATO members are talking about

sending them Soviet-made kit.

#### Sanctions fail to end war -- Russian oligarchs can't speak out

**O'Connor 3/2022** (Eileen O'Connor - former journalist and attorney
who worked in Russia and Ukraine. "Putin Cares About Only One Thing, and
It's Not Oligarchs." The New York Times. March 25, 2022.
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/opinion/russia-ukraine-putin-sanctions-oligarchs.html)

As President Vladimir Putin faces the biggest test of his now-22-year
reign, squeezed between a passionate Ukrainian resistance and tightening
sanctions on oligarchs, oil and technology transfers, the answer remains
the same, as it has throughout Russian history. Many in the West are
hoping for Mr. Putin's overthrow. They do not understand Russia or the
attitudes that people there have toward power. Russian scholars have
long noted that the absence of private property rights and impartial
legal authority lead to state actors holding the power that determines
the lives of Russians in every way. Beyond its borders, Russia has since
the 15th century exerted its power through military aggression. In a
country [where power is nearly everything, **sanctions** and lost
fortunes alone will **not change** that fundamental
dynamic.]{.underline} Mr. Putin's speech earlier this month proves the
point and illustrates what he and many in [Russia see as the objective
of the war: to defend Russian territory and sovereignty against Western
dominance]{.underline}. To him, the West has ignored Russia for too
long, and denied it superpower status. In Western capitalist
democracies, wealth often equates to access and influence. So it's not
surprising that many believe that sanctioning oligarchs can move them to
pressure Mr. Putin to change course. That is a miscalculation. These
oligarchs may hold wealth that connects them to power and that can be
used by Mr. Putin, but in Russia, that does not mean that they wield any
power over him or those in the Kremlin. It all goes back to the 1990s,
when I witnessed mostly former Communist Party officials amassing wealth
through a privatization of state assets overseen by Mr. Chubais. Those
who then vowed fealty and lent money to Mr. Yeltsin's political campaign
became even wealthier, granted ownership of the largest state-owned
enterprises in oil, gas and raw materials like nickel and aluminum.
Today they remain the richest men in Russia. But the lack of properly
defined property rights and a legal and institutional framework to
protect them meant these oligarchs still depended on the Kremlin,
occupied since 2000 by Mr. Putin. Court decisions for or against
oligarchs could easily be reversed depending on the favor of the
Kremlin. In the 2000s, after I had transitioned to working as an
attorney representing Western investors in the region, I saw this
dynamic myself. And the source of oligarchs' wealth is not the only
thing Mr. Putin can control. [He has made clear the dangers of
challenging his hold on power]{.underline}. Take the case of Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, who was once the wealthiest man in Russia. Rising from the
ranks of the Communist Youth, Khodorkovsky obtained several formerly
state-owned oil fields in Siberia and formed the corporation Yukos. In a
televised meeting at the Kremlin in 2003, he dared to criticize the
government as corrupt. Mr. Putin responded by stripping Mr. Khodorkovsky
of his assets and putting him in prison for 10 years, until he was
allowed to leave to live in exile. Experiences like Mr. Khodorkovsky's
may explain why so [few oligarchs are speaking out now]{.underline}. The
only ones who have said anything about the war have done so from the
comfort of places like London, where Mikhail Fridman, the founder of
Alfa-Bank, put out a statement saying that "war can never be the answer"
--- but not criticizing the president. Even with that, Mr. Putin, in his
recent speech, lumped those oligarchs in with his adversary, the West,
saying "they can't get by without oysters or foie gras" and that they do
not mentally exist "here, with our people, with Russia." He vowed to
spit them out "like a midge that flew into our mouths." That might have
been why Mr. Chubais --- who, in addition to overseeing the
privatization push, became an oligarch in his own right, and has
remained in Mr. Putin's good graces --- resigned his symbolic position
as climate czar and left the country. The only people who can truly sway
Mr. Putin are ideologues who share his views, the so-called siloviki.
The word literally means people with force --- the power that comes from
being in the security forces or military. These insiders have been with
Mr. Putin since his days in the K.G.B. or in the St. Petersburg
municipal government, and they see themselves as protectors of Russia's
power and prestige. [They have kept their **money** mostly inside Russia
and **out of reach of sanctions.**]{.underline} And like Mr. Putin, they
see the dissolution of the Soviet Union as the greatest catastrophe of
the 20th century, and believe this fight is for Russia's "sovereignty
and the future of our children." To influence them, the West must
prioritize the things that they believe give Russia its superpower
status: its oil and its military. Russia's oil and gas sector provides
as much as 40 percent of the country's federal budget revenues and
accounts for 60 percent of the country's exports. That is why [President
Biden's focus on sanctions banning oil imports is
important]{.underline}, though somewhat symbolic, [given how little the
United States imports from Russia]{.underline}. While Germany has halted
development of a major gas pipeline, the European Union has not cut off
Russian supplies, which represent around 40 percent of its needs,
arguing it will take time to find alternative sources. If European
countries were serious about affecting Mr. Putin's thinking, they would
spend less time seizing oligarchs' yachts and more lessening their
dependence on Russian energy. Likewise, the West must push for India and
China to join these sanctions as well. Meanwhile, the best way to
undermine Russia's military is by limiting access to technology. As has
become clear on the ground in Ukraine, the Russian military lacks the
vital hardware and software used by other modern forces to gather
real-time field intelligence, along with the communication systems
necessary to use that intelligence effectively. And the dayslong
stalling of a tank convoy indicates that the Russians lack a
sophisticated supply-chain system to bring food and gas to troops.
[Sanctions cutting off access to the tools that keep Russia's military
operating]{.underline} --- the overt exertion of power [--- can make a
difference to those advisers around Mr. Putin. The United States and
Europe imposed sanctions to do just that, but they must encourage India
and China to do the same.]{.underline} It may not be easy, but doing so
will depend on whether the United States can make the case that the
principles of sovereign nations and the world order they rely on are
under an existential threat. In an interview with Bloomberg, Mr.
Fridman, the London-based oligarch who has [since been put under British
sanctions,]{.underline} [said that if the European Union thought he
could tell Mr. Putin "to stop the war and it will work, then I'm afraid
we're all in big trouble," because that means Western leaders
"**understand nothing about how Russia works**."]{.underline}

#### Sanctions legitimize Putin's power -- he is proud of withstanding economic hardships from the West

[For Russians, the recession of the 1990s, when the economy underwent an
unprecedented structural transformation, is an important benchmark. At
the beginning of that transformation, the economy lost 52% of its
output.]{.underline} By comparison, during the Great Depression, a
textbook example of economic collapse, the American economy declined by
only 34%. [**Many of Russia's ruling class have been in power since that
period. Thus, their tolerance for economic calamities is unimaginably
high.** The inconsequential sanctions of 2014 only reinforced their
confidence that recovery will inevitably follow once the economy
adjusts]{.underline}. Soon after the first 2022 sanctions were
implemented, **[Putin's government stated that he expected the economy
to recover after a temporary increase in inflation and
unemployment]{.underline}**. But sanctions are not only an inadequate
deterrence for Putin -- they are actively tightening his grip on power.
**[Putin legitimises his rule by claiming Russia is heroically
withstanding economic hardships caused by the West]{.underline}**. This
message is compatible with the Kremlin's framing of the Ukraine conflict
as a 'denazification' project and with its broader obsession with the
Second World War. Many Russians view the atrocities perpetrated by Nazi
Germany on the Eastern Front, the painful economic transformation of the
1990s, and the current economic sanctions as a single narrative, with
**[Putin continuing the fight against Russia's enemies both within and
outside the country]{.underline}**. **[All of this underlines the
futility of applying criminological principles such as incapacitation
and deterrence to a country]{.underline}**. While these principles may
be effective at preventing crimes carried out by individuals, they are
entirely inadequate for preventing aggression by states, even thoroughly
personified dictatorships like Putin's Russia. **[They are also
undermined by assigning collective blame to all Russians, who are in
many respects also victims of the country's unjust institutions and
political leadership.]{.underline}**

"We're now just coming up to the limit of how severely you can impose
sanctions against a major economy without it having such bad spillover
effects that you are creating a ton of bushfires elsewhere," said
Nicholas Mulder, a Cornell University professor and author of "The

as part of US efforts to push the government further out of Russia's
orbit. His absence will fan concerns that the US lacks an influential
voice to play that role at an even more perilous time. Officials from
the State Department, Treasury Department and National Security Council
all declined to comment. But other people familiar with the dynamic
characterized it as a healthy internal debate and denied any suggestion
that agencies were pitted against each other. One said that it's
Treasury's normal role to scrutinize decisions that could disrupt
economic flows. [[Russia's \$285 Billion Oil and Gas Bonanza Is Funding

The debate mirrors broader tensions in the trans-Atlantic alliance, with
agreement harder to find on how much more pain to inflict on Putin. A
harbinger of the challenges to come emerged in recent days, when the
European Union agreed to pursue a ban on oil imports \-- but only after
granting

to Hungary \-- and then were unable to decide on what to do next or how
aggressively to go after gas imports. Until now, unity had been a
defining characteristic of the US and European response to the war. "We
continue to look at what other sanctions we can impose," Jose Fernandez,
the undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the
environment, said in an interview. He stressed the importance of Western
unity, saying Putin faces a "solid group of countries that are dead set
against the invasion." "You've got countries applying for NATO
membership," Fernandez said. "That kind of unity \-- and sanctions are
part of that \-- is something I don't think he was expecting." One
person familiar with the matter said the US focus on unity had been so
all-encompassing that the Americans had even asked the UK in recent
weeks not to pursue a trade battle with Ireland over Northern Ireland
for fear it would give Putin a weak spot to exploit. [[Russian Wins in

Yet with Putin undaunted by the economic chokehold and pressing ahead
with his war, there are growing calls within the administration to test
that unity by taking action against other countries and companies that
help Russia evade sanctions or provide what the US calls "material
support" to sanctioned entities. They argue that such moves would be
narrowly targeted, nothing like the broad sanctions campaign that sought
to stifle Iran over its nuclear program by targeting almost any country
or company that did business with Tehran. Many US allies and
humanitarian groups argued that approach was counterproductive. But
supporters of the harder line say that, with the war in its fourth
month, its time has come. "There's a time and a place for considered US
unilateral action," said Edward Fishman, a former State Department
official who is now an adjunct professor at Columbia University.
"There's no good argument against maximizing sanctions on Russia. And
the sooner you do it, the better because time isn't really on our side."
But that's testing the limits of what sanctions can do in the face of a
evidence **[that even crippling penalties fail to force stubborn regimes
to capitulate]{.underline}**. Skeptics point to [sanctions programs
against nations such as North Korea, Venezuela, Syria and Cuba that have
only entrenched adversarial leaders determined to hunker down and pass
the suffering onto their own populations]{.underline}. If the US goes
forward with more sanctions, it might find itself largely alone in such
efforts, in effect inserting the wedge between it and allies that Putin
has a history of exploiting. It could also further roil energy markets,
possibly causing new pain at US gas pumps. [[Putin Needs Help From China

Some in the Biden administration seeking a more cautious approach have
floated the idea of a price cap \-- not restricting the flow of oil, but
merely the price that would be paid for it. That idea faces considerable
skepticism given that it's never been tried before. Two people familiar
with the matter said there was also a belief internally that the price
cap idea was part of an effort to redirect clamor in Congress and among
outside groups away from imposing secondary sanctions on Russian energy
exports, which they fear would spur even stronger macroeconomic shocks.
The debate is also forcing a wider reassessment of the sanctions
campaign. Officials are confronting the fact that the [oligarchs who
have been targeted by sanctions may not wield the influence with Putin
they once had]{.underline}. And the administration has shifted away from
its argument that sanctions could hasten the end of the war to the claim
that sanctions, export controls and other restrictions will take a long
time \-- perhaps years \-- to weaken Putin. "I wouldn't say the system
is broken, but over-reliance on these tools to direct your foreign
policy is a problem," said Julia Friedlander, a former Treasury
Department official. "It's an asymmetry between trying to stop a
government from invading a country and doing so by following money
around the world. I still say do it, but there are hitches in the
concept itself."

#### Sanctions alone will not end the war in Ukraine, but sanctions do risk stronger ties between China and Russia

**Dempsey 22,** (JUDY DEMPSEY, NONRESIDENT SENIOR FELLOW CARNEGIE EUROPE
EDITOR IN CHIEF, March 10, 2022, "Judy Asks: Can Sanctions End Russia's
War in Ukraine?", https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/86606)

The [threat of sanctions did not prevent President Vladimir Putin's war,
but the reality of them may help to end it. While hopeful voices have
wondered if sanctions might produce enough popular discontent inside
Russia to cause Putin to reverse course, this is unlikely. Instead,
while no one can say definitively when the war will end, we can expect
that it will end with a settlement.]{.underline} No matter how poorly
his military seems to be doing---and it appears they are performing
quite poorly indeed---Putin retains capacity to draw out the conflict
into a bloody, rolling horror in the months to come. The strength and
severity of the sanctions and their palpable effect on the Russian
economy are likely to incentivize Putin to seek a settlement sooner than
he otherwise would and could offer bargaining chips to counter some of
Russia's most egregious demands. To be clear, the sanctions won't lead
to a good deal soon; the deal will still be bad and too late, but not as
bad and as late as it might have been. And even if they don't help end
this war, they are important both as an immediate step toward
accountability and as a potential deterrent to other actors in the
future. KRZYSZTOF BLEDOWSKICOUNCIL DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ECONOMIST AT THE
MANUFACTURERS ALLIANCE FOR PRODUCTIVITY AND INNOVATION [It depends on
whose sanctions. **Russia had factored in the sanctions cost of the war
before triggering it.** The actual breadth and depth of sanctions
alongside private capital flight, trade restrictions, and diplomatic
ostracism probably surprised the Kremlin. But there also exists in
Russia a cost-benefit calculation when it comes to stopping the war
short of its goal. And here, the cost of failure---not overthrowing the
Kyiv government and subjugating the population---must also be set
against the burden of the West's sanctions.]{.underline} Aside from the
West, there's one other global power whose economic and strategic
capacity makes a difference in the Kremlin's calculations, and that's
China. When Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela suffocated under the West's
sanctions, these countries could count on Russia and China to evade some
of them. So long as Beijing straddles the fence, Russia's economy won't
implode. It will experience hyperinflation, its living standards will
erode, and its long-term growth will decline. But it will muddle
through. However, should China signal it is prepared to shadow the
West's sanctions, the calculations in Moscow would change. Alas, it is
not clear whether for Beijing, the advantages of China's lining up with
the West would make up for the costs of a rupture with Russia. ROBERT
COOPERCOUNCIL MEMBER AT THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS Yes.
But sanctions are only one element. The story begins with the horror of
Russia's attack on Ukraine, its neighbor and cousin; then the
courageous, inspiring resistance of a united Ukrainian people. Add to
that the crushing economic penalties, cutting Russia off from the global
system and, in a world where we are all joined together, anything is
possible. In war, wrote Napoleon, the moral stands to the material in a
ratio of three to one. These sanctions are different from past cases
such as Cuba or South Africa. Those aimed at regime change. With
Ukraine, the plan is simpler: empty the war chest and stop the war. If
President Vladimir Putin falls too, that would be a bonus. MARTIN
EHLCHIEF ANALYST AT HOSPODÁŘSKÉ NOVINY [These are the most comprehensive
sanctions any superpower or major developed country has had to face
since 1945. So one would expect them to work. But even experts warn that
**sanctions** per se **are not the instrument for winning wars**---as
history teaches us. At this moment in time, these sanctions are an
irreplaceable tool the international community can use against the
Russian regime. I am not naive to think that Russians will rise up
against Vladimir Putin immediately due to the impossibility to use Apple
Pay. And I also do not believe the unprecedented unity of the democratic
West would survive a longer period.]{.underline} But for the here and
now, these sanctions could significantly contribute to persuading the
Russian government to stop fighting because they show the unity of the
West, a unity which nobody---neither us nor Putin---imagined possible
about three weeks ago. THERESA FALLONDIRECTOR OF THE CENTRE FOR RUSSIA,
EUROPE, ASIA STUDIES (CREAS) Sanctions as such cannot end the war. They
can create hardship for the Russian population, but historically
Russians are used to suffering and the official Russian propaganda will
put the blame for the sanctions squarely on the West. Propaganda will
paint the sanctions as unjust persecution of Russia by its enemies and
will try to use them to rally the people around the regime. Only a
minority have access to outside information and are ready to protest
against the government. [**Sanctions will make Russia more dependent on
trade with China**, increasingly making Russia the junior partner in the
China-Russia de facto alliance, which I call "Chinusia." This will give
China access to Russia's vast natural resources, feeding China's
economic growth and military buildup. On the other hand, sanctions will
hurt the economic interests of Russia's economic, security, and
political elites (oligarchs).]{.underline} It is still possible for a
small elite to thrive, even under sanctions and in conditions of
economic isolation, as in North Korea. However, is Russia comparable to
North Korea? If the sanctions against Russia are sustained, there is a
hope that Russia's elites may act to put pressure on Putin to change
course, or they may try to replace Putin with a new leader altogether.
GEOFF KITNEYWRITER AND COMMENTATOR ON AUSTRALIAN AND INTERNATIONAL
AFFAIRS When Vladimir Putin visited Australia the one and only time in
September 2007 for an APEC meeting, a journalist asked him what he
thought of Australia, to which he replied: "I never think about
Australia." Despite its remoteness from Russia, Australia has vigorously
joined the global action to sanction Russia---not just to hurt Russia
but also to warn China. Australian leaders believe that widely enforced
sanctions are setting the Russian economy back decades. Australia wants
Beijing to see how united global action to cripple Russia is the price
to be paid for military adventurism of a kind it is contemplating toward
Taiwan. Australia sees its biggest long-term security threat coming from
what it calls "an arc of autocracy" formed by a strategic alliance
between Russia and China. [Australia believes the free world's response
to Russia's Ukraine war must be so strong that it will force China to
pause for thought about the likely cost of a military takeover of
Taiwan: that it may not be necessary for the West to go to war to make
China an economically damaged, pariah nation. From Australia's point of
view, even if sanctions don't end the war in Ukraine quickly, their
success will also be measured by the strength of the message it sends to
China.]{.underline} JOHN C. KORNBLUMFORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY
No. Sanctions alone cannot do the job. They are a limited tool
substituted for more difficult alternatives. The same was the case in
2014, after the Russian takeover of Crimea, and in 1968 and 1979 after
Prague and Kabul. I managed a sanctions package against Serbia in 1996
and 1997. In the end, it was the NATO bombing which forced then
president Slobodan Milošević to pull back. But NATO cooperation on
sanctions was essential to agreeing the military option. Sanctions may
help stop the Russian attack, but they will not change Russian behavior
overnight. Sanctions will help us maintain the moral high ground,
especially with the Russian people. Thirty years ago, our Russian
partners wanted a fresh start. Today, we may be forced to deal with
Vladimir Putin as we did with Milošević in Serbia. We probably can't
expect a return to the Charter of Paris, but at the same time cannot
modify it to meet Russian demands. Fifty years ago, German Social
Democrat Willy Brandt and then U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger
defined Western principles in a way that both Russia and China found
acceptable. Thirty years have passed since current arrangements were
agreed upon. Even without Russian attacks, it would be time to bring
some of the agreements up to date, just as we did with the Charter of
Paris and the Helsinki Summit in 1992. The active application of
sanctions will be essential in helping to define future goals. STEFAN
MEISTERHEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER AND DEMOCRACY PROGRAM AT THE
GERMAN COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS (DGAP) The most comprehensive
sanctions Western countries have ever enacted against Russia seriously
hit the Russian state, society, and economy. After these sanctions,
Russia will not be like it was before. It is about changing the way of
life for the Russian people and decoupling the country from the global
economy. At the same time, even if they are important, sanctions will
not stop Russian President Vladimir Putin in his war against Ukraine.
Putin is on an historical mission to get Ukraine back at any cost. He
has prepared this war over the years while he built a repressive apparat
for any internal opposition and securitized all parts of the Russian
state where the economy has to serve as an instrument to resist any kind
of sanctions. Russian oligarchs depend more on the Russian state than
they are able to resist Putin's policy. Even if people in the system are
shocked by what Putin is doing, for the time being, they fall into
patriotism or apathy. Sanctions will work in the medium term, but then
there might be no Ukrainian state anymore and Russia may be so isolated
that the West lacks any impact. Ukraine is fighting for European
security and needs any means to resist the Russian attack. Sanctions
alone will not stop Putin. MARIANN ŐRYHEAD OF THE FOREIGN DESK AT MAGYAR
HÍRLAP Western sanctions alone will most likely not end the war in
Ukraine. They were never enough to change the fundamental geopolitical
stance of Russia. Putin has a certain goal to reach and Russia has
probably prepared to deal with most of these sanctions. Of course, it's
also possible that the sanctions will change the course of events. Even
though Putin underestimated the EU's and the United States' willingness
to make sacrifices, these sanctions will hurt the West too. Some of
sanctions and the decisions made by big companies are aimed at making
the Russian people put pressure on their government. It is very hard to
estimate by Western logic and experience how the Russian people will
react. [**Sanctions can also have far-reaching consequences**. **Pushing
Russia toward China and India can create a new geopolitical
reality**.]{.underline} MARC PIERINIVISITING SCHOLAR AT CARNEGIE EUROPE
[Russia's invasion of Ukraine is unfolding in the most brutal fashion
imaginable and there is little clarity about the endgame. But, if Grozny
and Aleppo are any meaningful yardsticks of Russian military operations,
it is doubtful that, at this very moment, Western sanctions have any
effect on the Kremlin. There are two reasons for this. The first one is
that, by virtue of the current pattern of Western European imports of
gas, oil, and coal, Russia is still earning some \$600-700 million per
day---enough to fuel a massive war for a long period of
time.]{.underline} The second reason is that the Kremlin's political
motivations for such a massive invasion are solidly cast in ideology and
history. They are packaged in fabricated narratives and the media are
all but suppressed. Over the medium term, though, incremental sanctions
will have two effects. They will vastly increase the cost of war for
Russia and will cut it off from the West, its main source of income.
They will also make the consequences of the invasion visible to each
citizen of Russia, each policymaker, and each general. Even in Russia,
that may matter.

### 1nc -- sanctions fuel HR violations

#### The US's overuse of sanctions has various unintended consequences - destabilization and humanitarian issues

**Guyer '22** (Jonathan Guyer, Jonathan Guyer covers foreign policy,
national security, and the world for Vox. From 2019 to 2021, he worked
at The American Prospect, where as managing editor he reported on
Biden's foreign-policy team. He has written for The New Yorker, The New
York Times, The Paris Review, and Rolling Stone. Previously, he spent
five years as a correspondent in Egypt and researched Arab political
cartoons as a Harvard Radcliffe fellow., "The Biden experts waging war

<https://www.vox.com/23041830/technocrats-waging-bidens-war-sanctions-russia>)

Most sanctions ramp up over weeks, months, or years, but the Russia
sanctions came together days after Russia's assault on Ukraine and were
initially harsh --- part of the administration's "start high and stay
high" approach. "We know where Russia's pressure points are," Singh told
NPR, reflecting on what he had learned since 2014. "So that's why
instead of taking a gradualist approach, we're prepared to start with
sanctions at the top of our escalation ladder and stay there." Just two
days after Russia's invasion, the US, the European Commission, and major
European countries imposed sanctions on Russia's central bank. The next
day, Japan joined. The central banks of petro-states like Venezuela and
Iran have been sanctioned before, but a country the size of Russia took
it to a whole new level. And since then, new sanctions are being rolled
out almost every week against individuals, companies, and banks.
Russia's energy sector is perhaps the last arena that the US has yet to
comprehensively sanction with its partners and allies. All told, 30
countries that consist of more than half of the global economy have
joined the coalition. The Biden administration official who spoke on
condition of anonymity emphasized that major Russian financial and
banking institutions have been sanctioned without causing major global
disruptions. "We've really carefully kicked the tires on these measures
before we've done them," the official said. "We've managed this in a way
that has been remarkably effective at minimizing collateral costs." The
central bank sanctions had to have been prepared methodically and well
in advance, says Daniel Fried, a former ambassador to Poland who
coordinated sanctions on Russia in Obama's State Department. "And I
thought, 'Damn, they're good,'" he told me. In 2014, Fried traveled
Europe with Singh, then a senior Treasury official, in advancing
sanctions against Russia during its initial invasion of Ukraine. "Jack
Lew, the Treasury secretary, basically sent Daleep \[Singh\] on my
delegation to make sure that 'Wild Man' Fried wouldn't trash the world
financial system with my sanctions on Russia," said Fried, who then
quickly realized that Singh was a huge asset and supported his work. Lew
told me the Treasury Department had studied "how Russia was
interconnected to the European global economy" to ensure that sanctions
didn't kick off a recession. "State was pushing to do more, and Treasury
was making the case to do it in a surgically targeted way, to have the
maximum impact you're looking for with the minimum unintended
consequences that could undermine the whole effort," Lew said. The
combined effort put pressure on Putin that, according to Lew, brought
Russia to the negotiating table and culminated in the 2014 Minsk
agreement. "If State and Treasury are knit up, who's gonna stop us?"
Fried added. Now, the stakes are higher. The sanctions against Russia
aren't just about Ukraine, but may impact the future of sanctions --- a
coercive tool that policymakers think might be the route of first resort
in a potential conflict against China. Julia Friedlander, a former
career Treasury official, said that if sanctions fail to achieve Biden's
goals in Europe, new questions will be raised about the tool. "Can we
really pretend to have faith in this kind of maximum pressure and
financial sanctions again?" she said. "Maybe we have to realize that
we've been barking up the wrong tree." It's also not been articulated
yet what lifting sanctions would look like. Singh said last month that
"we're not at the point at which we're talking about sanctions relief."
And an administration official declined to speculate about what
circumstances might lead to sanctions being lifted. Limited
congressional oversight means the president is not required to spell out
goals, say how the administration is tracking them, or describe
humanitarian fallout from sanctions. [**Critics worry that the
administration is overselling how effective sanctions will
be**.]{.underline} In March, for example, Rosenberg spoke to anti-money
laundering (AML) specialists. She went so far as to say, "The fate of
Ukrainian democracy and the strength of democracies to push back against
autocracy writ large depends on whether we do our jobs --- and whether
you do AML and Russian sanctions compliance work well." [Those who
praise the Biden administration's coordination of sanctions also express
concern about their **unintended consequences**.]{.underline} "I do
think that no one has really had the time to plan out what the
longer-term implications are going to be of essentially annihilating the
Russian economy," Friedlander, now a senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council, told me. The truth is that [**Russia will adapt --- it already
has**, and the ruble has begun to bounce back.]{.underline} Research
indicates that sanctions aren't a very effective tool unless formulated
within a broader foreign policy strategy. A 2019 report from the
Government Accountability Office found that government agencies aren't
great at assessing whether sanctions are working. "[We need more
accountability around sanctions policy --- when and how they're
successful,"]{.underline} said Michael Wahid Hanna of the International
Crisis Group. "[**US and European policymakers have never clearly
defined how weakening or diminishing the economic welfare of ordinary
people creates** the conditions for a **possible political or diplomatic
resolution to something as significant as a military
conflict**]{.underline}," said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj of the economic
research institution Bourse and Bazaar Foundation. The intensive
sanctions on Russia will also change the way countries think about the
free movement of capital[. Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute for
International Economics has argued that **these sanctions on Russia will
have a corrosive effect on the world economy that might result in the
"end of globalization.**" Above all, the **humanitarian effects may be
staggering and could elevate international food prices by up to 22
percent, with vulnerable people bearing most of the war's
costs**.]{.underline} As a result of US sanctions, **[Iranians suffered
from limited access to medicine, especially early in the pandemic. In
Venezuela, sanctions contributed to the collapse of the health care
system]{.underline}**. Humanitarian exemptions are built into sanctions
for foods, agricultural items, and medicines, as well as licenses for
some international organizations and nonprofit groups to operate in
Russia. "Even so, they don't always work to mitigate those unintended
impacts in the way that the designers and implementers of sanctions law
or executive orders intend," a Democratic congressional aide told me.
Lew explained that sanctions at this level will inevitably hurt
Russians. "When you're in a war, like the war that Russia has created
here, it's impossible to protect all the quote-unquote innocent people,
and there's a question of what innocent means when your country is doing
things like that," he told me. Since OFAC is so understaffed, former
Treasury officials explained, it can be difficult to create enough
licenses and waivers for humanitarian reasons. The **[humanitarian
consequences "can never be a secondary issue,"]{.underline}** said
Adeyemo, who says he and his team are "thinking about how we can get
more consistency around our humanitarian carve-outs." **[Banks tend to
overcomply with sanctions: they want to avoid potential hits to their
reputations, and are generally overcautious.]{.underline}** More than
250 companies have already left Russia, including airlines, banks,
consulting firms, and retailers. One bank executive told me that they
had been working 15-hour days since December to understand the
overlapping layers of Biden's sanctions. There are **[concerns the
humanitarian fallout could become collateral or peripheral to the
immediate crisis.]{.underline}** "If you really want to amp the pressure
up as much as possible, you're obviously going to affect the
population," Friedlander said. So when the Biden administration
announces that they've taken the humanitarian dynamic into account, as
the White House often does in press releases, it's only part of the
story. "You've taken it into account but then you bagged it," she
explained. "And then you try to mitigate it afterward." Narges Bajoghli,
an anthropologist at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies who is writing a book on sanctions, says the fact that the
sanctions team uses military terminology suggests that the humanitarian
consequences are, to some extent, intentional. "It's similar to the way
in which the humanitarian aspect is thought about in some ways in a hot
war situation," she said, "where, yes, it's unfortunate, but it's a
necessary byproduct of going up against the state."

### 1nc -- disinformation failing

#### Russian disinformation campaigns about Ukraine are failing now -- Europe and North America shoot down false narratives

[**Russian attempts to sell false narratives** in the West about the
invasion of Ukraine **are failing**]{.underline}, say a Canadian general
and senior NATO and European officials. At a security conference in
Ottawa, they said [**misinformation campaigns** **by the Kremlin are
being successfully thwarted and countered in both Europe and North
America.**]{.underline} But they warn Russian President Vladimir Putin
is stirring up dissent in Africa and the developing world by blaming
Western sanctions for food shortages resulting from the Russian invasion
and the blockade of Ukraine's ports. Putin's strategy is trying to
increase Russia's sphere of influence not just in Ukraine but in Africa
and the developing world by sowing dissent and "weaponizing everything"
including food, the conference heard. Lt.-Gen. Giovanni Manione, deputy
director general of the EU Military Staff, said on top of the four
riders of the apocalypse --- conquest, war, famine and death --- there
was a fifth rider in this conflict: disinformation. "How many countries
will fall to Russia without shooting a single shot in Africa and Asia?"
he asked, adding that disinformation was difficult to counter. The
conference heard that [**in Russia a majority believe Putin's spin**
about its action in Ukraine]{.underline}, [**but that the same
narratives were not penetrating in the West.** Outside Russia, the EU,
Canada**, NATO and Ukraine are successfully shooting down false Kremlin
narratives**, including that food shortages are caused by the
West]{.underline}, the conference heard. "The Russians are so cocooned
by the propaganda, they will never listen to us," Manione warned. The
European Security and Defence Symposium in Ottawa was attended by
Canadian military leaders and defence officials, as well as senior
figures from NATO, the EU and Ukraine and European ambassadors to
Canada. Jay Janzen, communications director for NATO's Allied Command
Operations, said [Russia has experienced "catastrophic
failure]{.underline}" since the invasion of Ukraine, [including with its
misinformation campaigns]{.underline} and was not "10 feet tall."
Maj.-Gen. Michael Wright, commander of the Canadian Forces Intelligence
Command, said [the U.K., U.S. and Canada have **successfully countered
disinformation from Russia** since the beginning of the
war.]{.underline} Early on, [the U.K. and U.S. had declassified
intelligence to show what Russia's intentions really were]{.underline}.
[Canada has also taken action to counter false narratives from the
Kremlin.]{.underline} Charles Fries, EU deputy secretary-general for
common security and defence policy, said the EU is fighting "a huge
battle of narratives" and pushing back Russian propaganda, including
"totally untrue" Kremlin claims that food shortages stem from sanctions.
He said the invasion is now "far larger than a European war" and Russia
is "now using food products as a weapon and is using the food security
concerns as a kind of blackmail to put pressure on poor countries and
some African countries." The EU and allies' sanctions had never targeted
food supplies for the world, or even fertilizer exports from Russia, and
the Russian claims were untrue, he said. Putin's belief that the
invasion would divide the EU and sap its resolve has backfired, he said.
"[Putin wants to divide us and he achieved exactly the
opposite]{.underline}," Fries said. "[So **it is a total
failure**]{.underline}." Yegor Chernev, a Ukrainian MP and head of
Ukraine's delegation at NATO, warned that "the Russians will continue
their false narratives, their fake news" and will try to spread these
falsehoods in Canada and Europe. He also said the allies had to be
prepared to deal with Russian "blackmail" with gas and oil.

[The Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to a **dramatic shift in
attitudes in Poland**]{.underline}, a key European partner and one which
only three decades ago was part of the former Soviet Union's Eastern
Bloc. [Negative attitudes among Poles towards Russia are at all-time
highs since Pew Research Center began tracking opinion on this question
in 2007, with virtually unanimous negative opinions of the Russian
state. Currently, **94% see Russia as a major threat, up from 65% who
said this in 2018, and 94% have no confidence at all in Russian
President Vladimir Putin** -- also an all-time high]{.underline}. The
sharp decline in positive attitudes toward Russia has benefited Poland's
western allies, specifically the United States, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (Poland is a member of
both NATO and the EU). [**Around nine-in-ten Poles have a favorable view
of the U.S., NATO** and the EU, all of which represent the **highest
shares since 2007**]{.underline}. In terms of Poland's relationship with
the U.S., the increase in favorable attitudes toward America coincides
with a strong 82% confidence rating for U.S. President Joe Biden, a
marked increase from the 51% who had confidence in former President
Donald Trump in 2019. [In addition, roughly **two-thirds in Poland see
having a close relationship with the U.S. as more important than having
one with Russia**. Only 1% want a closer relationship with Russia, while
28% volunteer that both are equally important. Just three years ago,
more than half of Poles (53%) offered that both relationships are
equally important. The shift in attitudes also benefits Polish views of
the NATO alliance**. Roughly nine-in-ten Poles have a favorable view of
NATO, including 34% with very favorable opinions of the military
alliance**. Currently, 84% of Poles support arming Ukraine through NATO
and 75% want Ukraine to become a NATO member, a substantial increase in
support since 2015.]{.underline} In addition, roughly two-thirds in
Poland say they would support their country using military force to
defend a NATO ally from a hypothetical Russian military action, and
about the same share say the U.S. would defend that NATO ally. This
support for military action in the event of a Russian attack on a NATO
ally is up a considerable amount since the question was last asked in
2019. Another clear beneficiary of the decline in ratings for Russia is
the EU: It has received its highest rating in Poland (89%) since Pew
Research Center began asking the question in 2007. And Poles are now
much more likely than they were in 2018 to say that the EU understands
the needs of Polish citizens and promotes democratic values, prosperity
and peace. Fewer now also say that the EU is intrusive or inefficient[.
A majority (57%) says that the economic integration of Europe has
strengthened the Polish economy.]{.underline} Most Poles say EU promotes
peace, democratic values and prosperity [More than three million
Ukrainians have fled to Poland since Russia's invasion, and
**eight-in-ten Poles now support taking refugees from countries where
people are fleeing violence and war, up from 49% who held that view in
2018.**]{.underline}

### 2nc -- Poland support high

#### Poland is the country that supports Ukraine the most in the Russia-Ukraine war

aiding Ukraine." TFN. June 01, 2022.

[**Poland** has come first in a ranking countries **giving aid to
Ukraine**]{.underline}, the Polish edition of Forbes magazine has
reported. The magazine analysed the activities of many countries based
on 11 criteria to create an index showing which states were most engaged
in helping Ukraine. It took into account voting at the UN General
Assembly on demanding a Russian withdrawal, recognising Russian acts in
Ukraine as genocide, expulsion of Russian diplomats, including Russia on
a list of \"hostile countries,\" taking part in a conference at the
Ramstein base in Germany on support for Ukraine, the extent of financial
aid granted both in absolute terms and as a proportion of GDP, visits of
high-ranking officials to Ukraine between February 24 and May 30, and
opposition to imposing sanctions on Moscow. [The highest possible score
was 100 with countries scoring more than 40 points recognised as being
friendly towards Ukraine]{.underline}. [Poland came first with 97
points]{.underline} with the USA second on 96 and Estonia third on 95.
Also in the top 10 were Latvia (94), Canada (88), Lithuania (88), Great
Britain (88), Slovakia (82), the Czech Republic (81) and Portugal (78).
[The ranking\'s authors highlighted visits by Polish government
officials to Ukraine, actions on the international political arena and

USD **3.1 billion,**]{.underline} or 0.46 percent of its GDP.

#### Poland supports Ukraine -- welcoming refugees and rallying Europe

**Higgins 2022** (Andrew Higgins - Moscow Bureau Chief for the New York
Times. "Long on Europe's Fringe, Poland Takes Center Stage as War Rages
in Ukraine." The New York Times. March 25, 2022.
https://archive.ph/bEU8a)

On Wednesday, Poland said it had identified 45 Russian diplomats as
spies, all of whom had been ordered to leave the country. The deputy
foreign minister, Pawel Jablonski, said [Poland could not tolerate
Russia's abuse]{.underline} of its embassy in Warsaw when Moscow "is
waging a barbaric war against Ukraine." Spies disguised as diplomats, he
added, not only "pose a threat to Poland's security, but also to the
security of Ukrainian citizens staying in Poland. Hence this decision."
Previously scolded by Brussels for its hostility to migrants, [Poland
has over the past month **welcomed more than two million refugees**
fleeing the war next door in Ukraine, far more than any other country.
It has also become a vital staging post for the supply of weapons,
ammunition, fuel and other assistance to Kyiv]{.underline} and put
itself at the center of deliberations shaping the West's response to the
crisis. Warsaw has become the capital through which all diplomatic,
military and humanitarian roads to Ukraine now pass. And the Polish
government, which earlier infuriated Washington by pushing through
legislation, later vetoed by the president, that threatened an
American-owned television network, is basking in the glow of
appreciative attention. In recent weeks, it has received visits and
praise from Vice President Kamala Harris; the head of the C.I.A.,
William Burns; Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III; the president of
the European Council, Charles Michel; and a host of other senior U.S.
and European officials. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national
security adviser, on Tuesday described [Poland]{.underline} as a
"frontline and very vulnerable ally" that "[has taken the brunt of the
humanitarian impact outside of Ukraine."]{.underline} Poland's sudden
prominence as NATO's most exposed frontline state has stirred alarm that
it could be sucked into the conflict, particularly after Russian
missiles last week obliterated a Ukrainian military base near the
border. Among those most worried are some of the Ukrainians who fled to
escape fighting at home. "Poland is too close. I want to get out of
here," said Yevgeny Pyskuko, a music teacher who fled to Poland after
Russian forces attacked a huge nuclear power station near his home in
southeastern Ukraine. "I want to go across the ocean. It is not safe
here," he added. Despite the possible risks, [Poland has been in the
forefront of **rallying Europe** to take tough measures to punish
President Vladimir V. Putin for his aggression]{.underline}. When
Germany, stunned by Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, weighed
whether to preserve the longstanding pillars of its security and foreign
policy toward Russia, Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki ---
who just a few weeks earlier had attended a conclave of Putin-friendly
populists in Madrid --- flew to Berlin to personally "shake Germany's
conscience" and stiffen its resolve against Moscow. Soon after Mr.
Morawiecki's trip to Berlin, the German government dropped its earlier
resistance to sending weapons to Ukraine and to ejecting key Russian
banks from a money transfer network known as SWIFT. Poland's deputy
culture minister, Jaroslaw Sellin, a conservative firebrand who
previously relished his country's role as Europe's great disrupter, has
found a new cause celebrating Poland's favor at the center of attention.
"Everyone watches us with admiration," he told Radio Gdansk on Tuesday.
Long-running squabbles with the European bloc over the rule of law,
L.G.B.T.Q. rights, coal mining and various other issues still rumble in
the background and the government's critics worry that instead of
curbing what they see as a steady demolition of democratic norms by the
governing party, Law and Justice, Poland's newfound favor will only
embolden the government. "We are in this respect another victim of the
war," lamented Roman Kuzniar, a professor at Warsaw University who
advised the country's previous pro-European governments before Law and
Justice took power in 2015. "War always helps those who are ruling a
country. It would be too bad if both the European Union and the United
States forget about all the wrong things that this government has done
and is doing," he added. For the moment, however, security issues have
trumped the governing party's image as a disruptive force obsessed with
stoking culture wars and hostility to foreigners, particularly migrants,
bureaucrats in Brussels and Germans. "The government focused too much on
stupid things instead of more important things like security," Mr.
Bartosiak said. "But now everybody in Poland sees what matters."
Supported in Parliament by even its fiercest political enemies, Law and
Justice last week enacted a new Homeland Defense Act that will increase
military spending to 3 percent of gross domestic product, from around
2.2 percent. Poland was already one of only 10 countries in the
30-member NATO alliance that met a minimum spending target of 2 percent.
[Polish **foreign policy**, preoccupied until the war in Ukraine with
efforts to form a bloc of like-minded conservative and often pro-Kremlin
European populists who share its hostility to Brussels, is now working
to cement a new bloc of European countries **pushing for tougher
sanctions** against Russia]{.underline}, including the Baltic states and
the Czech Republic. At a meeting of European foreign ministers this week
in Brussels, Poland joined Lithuania and other countries on Europe's
eastern fringe that have a long and painful experience of Russian
aggression in lobbying hard for a ban on oil imports from Russia. The
effort failed in face of strong opposition from Germany, the Netherlands
and others, but it put Warsaw at the center of an emerging bloc of
nations determined to punish Mr. Putin for invading Ukraine. It has also
sundered Poland's close partnership with Hungary, which opposes further
sanctions and whose proudly illiberal prime minister, Viktor Orban,
shares the Polish governing party's view on Brussels but has a long
record of cozying up to the Kremlin.

"Ukraine: The view from Warsaw", The Interpreter, Published 27 May 2022
05:00 ,
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/ukraine-view-warsaw)

This week I was in Warsaw listening to experts on regional strategy and
security. It was clear that Poland sees itself as Ukraine's champion.
Beyond the immediate emergency response following Russia's invasion,
**[Poland is acting as Ukraine's advocate]{.underline}** in building
support both across NATO and EU member states and, crucially, through
its relationship with the United States. Many would be aware [that
Poland been an important first responder, estimated to have taken in
close to [3.5 million refugees](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60555472)
and acting as a hub for humanitarian assistance]{.underline}. It's
important to see this in human terms: for example, the person I sat next
to on my flight was hosting five Ukrainian refugees while his
sister-in-law was hosting eight. As well as welcoming Polish-speaking
Ukrainians, who are figuratively (and sometimes literally) family, there
is huge sympathy for all Ukrainians as victims of Russian aggression.
[There is a visceral sense among Poles that "last time this was
us".]{.underline} This support isn't costless, with [[Poland's economy
being hit by the
war]{.underline}](https://www.reuters.com/article/poland-forecasts-idUSL5N2WO4WP).
Yet there is still a strong political consensus to continue to provide
support. Beyond this humanitarian response, Poland has been playing a
key role in advocating for Ukraine -- perhaps most importantly to the
United States. Polish and American experts alike admit that the United
States needed some convincing. The US saw the invasion coming and
sounded the alarm. But the belief that Ukraine would lose affected the
sort of support that the Biden administration considered providing --
such as a reluctance to provide high-end weapons in case they fell into
Russian hands. Poland sees the Biden administration as having adapted
over time, for example in its definition of offensive and defensive
weapons. **[Poland continues to apply pressure on the United States to
expand its support.]{.underline}** **It may have been an optimistic
view, but multiple experts talked of Ukraine potentially pushing Russia
back.** This is vital because the view from Warsaw is that the result of
the war is still very much to be decided. Russia has not yet been able
to defeat the Ukrainian army, occupy its terrain and break Ukraine's
will. The hot war is not over and is seen as moving into a middle phase
where Russia recalibrates its strategy (and redefines victory). It may
have been an optimistic view, but multiple experts talked of Ukraine
potentially pushing Russia back. If so, it could be a long war and one
that [Poland wants Ukraine to win]{.underline}. [Poland has also been a
powerful advocate within NATO and the European Union]{.underline}.
[Poland sees it as its responsibility to motivate others to mobilise in
support of Ukraine, building unity for a Russian strategic
defeat]{.underline}. From NATO experts, I heard again and again that 24
February was a watershed moment that fundamentally upended the European
security order by bringing a major land war to Europe. This framing was
not preordained; in another sense it is the continuation of an
eight-year war. [Poland]{.underline} can take some credit for this view
due to its consistent clarity of perspective. It [sees Russia as a rogue
state that flouts international law and advocates the need to impose
strategic costs on Russia, including treating Russia as an international
pariah]{.underline}. There is interest in the potential for Poland to
prosecute war crimes through its national courts or establish an
international special tribunal given that Russia is not a party to the
International Criminal Court. This unequivocal framing of the conflict
has had a lasting impact on threat perceptions and NATO unity. For
example, the old paradigm used to be that NATO would mobilise in event
of a crisis. The emerging one is to strengthen national armed forces to
be prepared to defend every inch of NATO territory. There is increasing
discussion of "multinationality", of joint training and learning how to
operate together. Poland has been working with the United States on a
program to build readiness and interoperability on NATO's Eastern flank
(now Eastern front). As Chief of the Polish Armed Forces General Rajmund
Andrzejczak stated, "the house of my neighbours is on fire". This makes
**[Poland a frontline country]{.underline}**. Its job is to convince the
rest of the European Union to express understanding, trust and
solidarity on the basis that they could one day find themselves in a
similar position. Those involved in European defence report a much
greater sense of common security. Certainly, there was a greater sense
of a unified "West" that is common in similar discussions in the
Indo-Pacific. The conflict was expressed as "us vs them", "liberal vs
illiberal", and there were irony-free references to the "free world".
(Along with the sense of the United States an indispensable power, it
feels quite nostalgic to an Indo-Pacific observer.) The common cause can
be seen in increased defence commitments and the announcement that
Sweden and Finland have applied to join NATO. I heard Polish Prime
Minister Mateusz Morawiecki commit to come to their defence if needed
during accession. What I heard in Warsaw underlines the scale of
Russia's strategic error. Russia clearly didn't expect the extent of
Ukrainian resistance -- or the wider effects on European unity and US
support. A more unified NATO with greater defence spending and an
expanded vision of collective security was not one of Russia's
ambitions. Neither was improved trans-Atlantic relations and US sense of
efficacy. Poland will continue to be an important part of building this
common commitment. What I took from Warsaw is how strongly [Poland
believes that it is its duty to do everything possible to support
Ukraine to achieve what Ukraine defines as victory]{.underline} -- and
the energy it is willing to expend to achieve this. As the Polish
Institute of International Affairs Director SŁawomir Debski put it, "we
know who we are, we know what we're fighting for, and we are not lacking
in determination."

### 1nc -- soft power in decline

#### **US soft power low under Biden**

**Korybko 5/5** (Andrew, a Moscow-based American political analyst. The
article reflects the author\'s opinions and not necessarily those of
CGTN, "Biden\'s literal weaponization of democracy discredits US soft
power," China Daily, May 5, 2022,
https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202205/05/WS62732e80a310fd2b29e5ab21.html)-AT

US President Joe [Biden]{.underline} gave one of the most important
speeches of his presidency thus far on May 3 at the Lockheed Martin Pike
County Operations in Troy, Alabama that\'s responsible for building its
anti-tank Javelin missiles. During his remarks, he [boasted about how
his country is literally weaponizing democracy through its
m]{.underline}ilitary-[i]{.underline}ndustrial
[c]{.underline}omplex[,]{.underline} which represents formal
acknowledgement of a process that\'s already been underway for decades.
From the president\'s perspective, the production and export of these
arms to Ukraine in its fight against Russia represents \"the arsenal of
democracy,\" which he compared to its unprecedented effort during World
War II to fight Nazi Germany and the Japan Empire. According to Biden,
this is a hybrid civilizational-political struggle between Western
democracy and supposedly non-Western autocracies that only comes around
once every six or eight generations. [**Biden\'s warmongering words
should concern the entire world**.]{.underline} His World War II-era
rhetoric about the American military-industrial complex supposedly being
an \"arsenal of democracy\" amounts to an unofficial declaration of
global hybrid war considering the context in which he made this
ridiculous description. The US plans to continue ramping up its military
production as it wages regional proxy wars against countries like Russia
under the pretext of supposedly saving Western civilization. [The real
reason why the US is doubling down on its
m]{.underline}ilitary[-i]{.underline}ndustrial [c]{.underline}omplex [is
because it\'s desperate to revitalize its shrinking economy which fell
1.4 percent in the last quarter]{.underline}. [The **American economic
model has failed to reap the successes** that were expected of it by its
leaders, hence the need to return to massively producing weapons in an
expensive attempt to stimulate it ahead of the upcoming midterm
elections]{.underline}. The ruling Democrats are worried that their
Republican rivals might win back control of Congress so Biden is doing
everything that he can to manipulate domestic perceptions in the run-up
to the vote. This includes misportraying his country\'s unprovoked
regional proxy war against Russia as a civilizational crusade comparable
to World War II and artificially boosting the economy through a renewed
focus on military-industrial production. The World War II-era imagery
and rhetoric is also intended to imply that Americans shouldn\'t
complain about their current economic suffering that might last for a
number of years since it\'s supposedly for the sake of saving Western
civilization. Biden is manipulating his compatriots\' patriotic
sentiments for self-interested political reasons related to reducing the
Democrats\' expected electoral losses during the fall midterms that\'ll
be held in half a year\'s time. [Awareness of these self-interested
motives and the manipulative way in which the ruling party\'s political
interests are being advanced **discredits the US\'s soft power even more
than it\'s already been in recent years**]{.underline}. First, [the
American economic model clearly isn\'t producing the results that it\'s
supposed to, hence the need to transition parts of the economy to a
literal wartime footing.]{.underline} Second, [the pretext for doing so
is the false narrative that countries like Russia threaten Western
civilization]{.underline}. Up until this point, [it was taken for
granted in the West that its political model was so appealing to the
rest of the world that it wouldn\'t need to be exported by force, let
alone upheld in such a way in its transatlantic cradle where it
initially emerged centuries ago. That was never truly the case, and now
none other than current American president himself is indirectly
acknowledging that by hyping up the supposed \"threat.\"]{.underline}
This brings the analysis around to the third and most powerful point,
and it\'s that Western democracies are more aggressive and globally
destabilizing than the countries they are pointing fingers at. After
all, it\'s not Russian President Vladimir Putin who is alluding to a
third World War nowadays, but Biden and his transatlantic peers who are
waging proxy war against Russia. It\'s for these reasons that Biden\'s
latest speech was arguably among the most important of his presidency
thus far, but not at all in a positive way. It can be interpreted as an
unofficial declaration of hybrid war that disturbingly evokes World War
II-era imagery and rhetoric, which has very dangerous implications if
one reflects on what that could ultimately entail. **[The US is so
desperate to slow the decline of its hegemony that it\'s destabilizing
the whole world to this end.]{.underline}**

### 2nc -- soft power in decline

#### Trump already killed US soft power

**Drezner '20** (Daniel W. Drezner, Professor of international politics
at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, "U.S.
soft power is only mostly dead," The Washington Post. 1/9/20.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/01/09/us-soft-power-is-only-mostly-dead/)

[Two years ago the hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts looked at
the survey data out there from Pew and Gallup about how the rest of the
world viewed President Trump and concluded, "**The United States is
losing its global standing because the world hates Donald Trump**.
Anyone who tells you differently is selling you something."]{.underline}
Twenty-four months is a lifetime in the Age of Trump. There has been no
world war or financial crisis during that time. Low bar, I know, but
perhaps this means the rest of the world has learned to like Donald
Trump. Well, maybe "like" is not the right word. Maybe the rest of the
world has exhibited some Stockholm syndrome and decided maybe Trump had
his good moments when he wasn't keeping everyone emotionally hostage?
Last year's Gallup data suggests the answer remains no, and now we have
the just-released findings from the latest Pew surveys. They reveal not
much has changed. Like, at all: ["As has been the case throughout his
presidency, U.S. President Donald Trump receives largely negative
reviews from publics around the world. **Across 32 countries surveyed by
Pew Research Center, a median of 64% say they do not have confidence in
Trump** to do the right thing in world affairs, while just 29% express
confidence in the American leader." Also unsurprisingly, the depth of
anti-Trump sentiment is especially strong where you would expect it:
Western Europe, where approximately 75 percent of respondents lack
confidence in Trump. **The numbers from Mexico are even worse: 89
percent have no confidence in him**. He has pockets of support in India,
Poland, Israel, the Philippines and not much else]{.underline}.
Obviously, these numbers are far worse than Barack Obama's at the same
stage of his presidency. They are also slightly worse than George W.
Bush's numbers at a similar stage in his presidency. Global distrust of
Trump is further revealed in the survey results in which respondents are
asked which foreign leader they trust to do the right thing in world
affairs. Trump scores well below German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French
President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin. About as
many people trust Trump as they do Chinese President Xi Jinping, but
more respondents have no confidence in Trump (Xi is less well-known). No
doubt Trump's supporters would argue it is better to be feared than
loved, as Machiavelli so eloquently put it. As Trump himself told Bob
Woodward and Robert Costa, "Real power is, I don't even want to use the
word, 'Fear.' " There are two problems with that counterargument. First,
feared leaders generally do not invite laughter from their peers. Trump
has had to cope with U.N. General Assembly leaders laughing at his face
and NATO leaders caught laughing behind his back. My Washington Post
colleague Aaron Blake has collected other examples[. Trump is not a
president people fear, except for his witless incompetence. Second,
Machiavelli also warned in the very next paragraph that "nevertheless a
prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win
love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared
whilst he is not hated." This quote seems particularly salient given the
reaction of some U.S. allies to the targeted killing of Qasem Soleimani.
As Politico's Matthew Karnitschnig noted, **"Behind the sober public
pronouncements from Brussels and national capitals about the need for
'de-escalation,' officials are seething**. ... Within hours of
Soleimani's assassination, Europe's shock over the Iranian general's
killing morphed into anger at Trump**." Trump has entered a new era of
warfare** by openly authorizing the assassination of another nation\'s
military leader, using an armed drone, says David Ignatius**. So this
seems like a depressing state of affairs for those Americans who desire
respect in the world**. Yet Trump is not the same thing **as the United
States of America**, and the latter's **standing in the world could best
be described as only "mostly dead**."]{.underline} As Pew reports,
overall attitudes toward the United States remain favorable. A small
majority of respondents have favorable views of the United States, a
full 25 percentage points above Trump's individual standing. This will
probably persist unless or until Donald Trump is reelected --- it was
after George W. Bush's 2004 reelection that global public attitudes
toward the United States started to converge to Bush's low levels.

#### No sign of US soft power recovery post-Trump

**Tengjun '21** (Zhang Tengjun, Deputy Director and associate research
fellow at Department for Asia-Pacific Studies, China Institute of
International Studies, "US soft power hard to return as its core rots,"
The Global Times. 1/12/21.
https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202101/1212546.shtml)

In an article entitled \"American soft power will survive Donald
Trump,\" Joseph Nye, who coined the term \"soft power\" in the late
1980s, argued that with Joe Biden in office, American resilience will
once again lead to a recovery of the US soft power. Nye stressed the US
has serious problems, but that \"it also has a capacity for resilience
and reform that has rescued us in the past.\" [**American soft power has
been eroded badly under Trump\'s presidency**.]{.underline} In 2019,
Gallup polled 134 countries and regions and found that only 30 percent
of the polled held a favorable view of the US, a drop of almost 20
points since Barack Obama\'s presidency[. There are mainly two reasons
for the decline of the US soft power. First, the Trump administration\'s
governance has undermined the US democratic system, aggravated social
conflicts and intensified political, economic and social crises in the
US. Second, the US under Trump willfully **withdrew from a string of
international organizations** and pacts, **disregarded international
rules** and **preached unilateralism and bullyism**, which made other
countries suffer a lot. The past four years have witnessed declining
confidence in the US leadership and US soft power around the world.
These brazen US acts have brought about fundamental changes: **All other
countries including US allies are becoming more
independent**]{.underline}. They are all considering how to better
safeguard their own national interests in a world without US leadership.
Even if the US soft power can recover somewhat, the perceptions of these
countries have altered. Nye said the US has a capacity for resilience
and reform which will help the US recover its attractiveness[. But can
the US capability for reform really lead to soft power recovery?
Trump\'s four-year tenure has made us see the weakness of US reforms and
governance. **The US government has been unable to solve its domestic
problems**. In fact, various problems even have been intensified due to
growing political polarization and partisan struggles. There have been
some voices in the US calling for reform over the past four years. **But
reform is stagnant**. It\'s in fact not merely the fault of the Trump
administration. It\'s the US deep political and social divisions that
obstruct the reform\'s advancement. **Whether it is the turmoil in
Capitol Hill, or the controversy surrounding the presidential elections,
or Trump\'s highly controversial governance in the past four years, many
observers believe that US democracy is already dead**. It not only
cannot avoid people like Trump to lead the country, it also has no way
to fix the problems existing in the US society. **This is an
institutional crisis**.]{.underline} Even if the Biden administration
comes to power and the transition is completed, what we will see will be
a deepened rift within the US. It will cause more difficulties for Biden
to govern the country in the future. Nye wants those who mourn American
democracy to understand that \"the 2020 election saw an unprecedented
turnout of voters who were able to unseat a demagogue.\" The problem is,
the number of people who voted for Trump has also hit the record[**. The
high level of political and social antagonism in the US is a systemic
crisis.** It is unrealistic to rely on a new administration to solve
these problems. After the Capitol riots, some countries have expressed
their regret and many other countries have been very disappointed. They
believe **the riots have ripped off the fake mask of US democracy.** The
attractiveness of US democracy to other countries has been severely
weakened. The US democracy represented by these riots is very
hypocritical. **The US has a set of standards for itself, but when it
turns to other countries\' domestic problems, it has other standards.
Therefore, many countries have recognized the true face of US
democracy.**]{.underline} Essentially, it serves the hegemony of the US.
It\'s not a universal democratic system or standard that other countries
need to admire. Therefore, the so-called beacon effect of US democracy
is weakening and declining. But regrettably, Nye and some other US
elites are still trapped in the myth of US democracy. They still have
blind faith in their democratic system. But in fact, such a kind of
impractical mentality will not likely help them find the light at the
end of a tunnel. The mentality does not help resolve the problems of the
US. At this time, it is more important to have profound reflections
about the US democratic system\'s inherent problems. The US should have
a humble and frank attitude and be more open to others\' criticism. The
US needs to seriously reflect on the root causes of its problems and
propose some systematic reform plans.

The images of bare-chested, flag-waving MAGA loyalists overtaking the US
Capitol flooded US social media and news channels in the days following
the January 6 siege against the electoral college count. Memed and
amplified, the same images circulated widely on Chinese social media and
state-owned news sites without even the need for critical commentary.
[The literal destruction of the US Capitol at the hands of President
Donald Trump\'s followers required little imagination to characterize
abroad as the downfall of American democracy]{.underline}. [**There are
many reasons for pessimism**.]{.underline} According to one of the most
authoritative indexes, Polity, the United States is no longer the
world's oldest continuous democracy, dropping in status to a system that
is part democracy, part dictatorship. Beyond the domestic concerns faced
in the aftermath of the breach of one of America\'s most hallowed
buildings, the Capitol siege was a win for China. **[US soft
power]{.underline}**, one of its comparative advantages in the great
power competition, [**has taken a huge hit**.]{.underline} Soft power is
"the ability to get what you want through persuasion or attraction in
the forms of culture, values, and policies".⁠ The US has been the primary
beneficiary of soft power, with its globally recognized brands, pop
culture, fast-food chains, world-renowned universities, and political
values. It is relatively low cost and high impact compared with other
forms of power. The United States\' relative attractiveness is one of
the reasons America prevailed in the Cold War. The Chinese government is
having a propaganda field day. [More than ever**, the US looks like a
country in decline**, discouraging to allies and potential partners.
Chinese commentators have noted that **America\'s days as the \"city on
the hill\" have come to an end.**]{.underline} This is karma, some say,
payback for the US supporting opposition groups, as in Hong Kong. As one
netizen commented on the popular microblog website Weibo: \"So lucky to
be born in China." China has also been trying to increase its soft power
through traditional mechanisms such as building its media, education,
and tourism sectors. It has enjoyed only moderate success in these areas
because of its censorship, pollution, and lack of independent civil
society. But COVID-19 has led to the strengthening of other Chinese
public diplomacy efforts, such as its landmark Belt and Road Initiative
global trade and investment scheme. Related initiatives such as the
Digital Silk Road, a program to build out global digital infrastructure
using Chinese technology, and the Health Silk Road, a plan to export
Chinese health expertise through things such as COVID-19 laboratories
and vaccine diplomacy, draw on China\'s comparative advantage in a
top-down soft power approach. Meanwhile, [**the Trump administration has
undermined the historical sources of US soft power**. It has shuttered
visa lines, investigated international students on campus, and driven
the rise of a culture of nationalism. The cancellation of the Fulbright
US Student Program and the Peace Corps program in China are prime
examples. And the COVID-19 decreased US media production, educational
exchange and tourism, which shrank opportunities for promoting its
democratic values on the global stage.]{.underline} A bird's-eye view of
America\'s relative soft power may seem to offer cause for optimism.
Even after four years of Trump\'s buffoonery and \"America First\", the
US is still far ahead of China, ranking fifth in overall soft power,
while China ranks 24th. And isn't this what matters in competition? Yes
and no. The problem is two-fold. First, the US relies more on its
political values as a soft power source than Beijing does. Ironically,
this has especially been the case during the Trump administration.
National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien has argued that democracies and
authoritarian countries such as China "are offering a different approach
to the world". Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has argued to
international audiences that democracy is "what we've got right".
Second, Beijing has tried to leverage its comparative advantages to
build soft power through pathways other than political values,
especially where a top-down government approach is effective. China set
up COVID-19 testing labs in Palestine in agreement with Israeli and
Palestinian authorities. It extended its hand in Africa by building more
than 70 percent of its 4G infrastructure. Depending on need, useful
solutions can be as compelling as political principles.[The future of
the US as a world leader is at stake]{.underline}. American military
base access worldwide depends on perceived political alignment between
the US and its allies. In the tech sector, the widespread adoption of US
platforms relies on other countries finding that benefits to allowing in
foreign platforms outweigh the potential political risks. Successful
multilateral treaty negotiations on issues such as global trade and
climate change rely on the perception of a dependable US political
system. Strengthening democracy at home and moving away from \"America
First\" policies will go a long way in reconstructing the trust and
relationships central to soft power. But [the United States will always
be seen as a country in which the election of Donald Trump to the
presidency, and now the storming of the Capitol, were possible.
President-elect Joe Biden will soon learn that soft power, once lost,
may be difficult to revive.]{.underline}

### 1nc -- war ending now

#### **Russia-Ukraine war slowing down -- Russia is running out of resources.** 

**Teh 6/23/22** (Cheryl Teh - Senior Breaking News Reporter. "Boris
Johnson says the Russian army might soon run out of soldiers and weapons
and lose its \'forward momentum\' in Ukraine." Insider. Jun 23, 2022.
<https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-russia-may-run-out-of-soldiers-and-weapons-2022-6>)

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said [this week that he believes
**Russia will soon lose momentum in its war with Ukraine**]{.underline}.
Speaking to the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Johnson said that
he thought Russian President Vladimir [Putin\'s army was suffering
**heavy losses of soldiers and equipment** just to gain ground in
Ukraine\'s]{.underline} Donbas region. Citing intelligence reports from
the British defense forces, Johnson told the outlet that he believed the
[Russian onslaught in Ukraine would likely **lose steam** in the coming
few months]{.underline}. \"Our defense intelligence service believes,
however, that in the next few months, Russia could come to a point at
which [there is **no longer any forward momentum** because it has
exhausted its resources]{.underline},\" he said, per Sueddeutsche
Zeitung. \"Then we must help the Ukrainians to reverse the dynamic. I
will argue for this at the Group of Seven summit,\" he said, per the
outlet. Johnson also told Sueddeutsche Zeitung that he thought it was
important for the Ukrainian army to be supported in launching a
counter-offensive if it is able to do so. \"This is their crisis. They
are the victims of Putin\'s aggression, they must decide what they want
to do. But it is absolutely clear if you go to Ukraine, if you talk to
the Ukrainians, and if you talk to \[Ukrainian President Volodymr\]
Zelenskyy. you will come away with the overwhelming view that the
Ukrainians will not concede their territory,\" he said, per the outlet.
Johnson added that he thought a win for Ukraine would include Russian
forces being repelled from the areas they invaded and for Ukraine to
\"regain the status quo\" before the invasion on February 24, per
Sueddeutsche Zeitung. \"Ukraine must win, we agree on that. The unity of
the West is far more conspicuous than the divisions,\" Johnson told the
outlet. Intelligence from the UK has suggested that Russia may soon
struggle to produce enough military equipment to fuel a prolonged
conflict in Ukraine. Ukraine\'s forces are currently engaged in a
critical fight in the Donbas. In June, Ukraine estimated that Russia had
10 to 15 times more artillery than its forces, appealing to the West to
send more weapons. Reports have also cited a growing number of deserters
among Ukrainian forces. Earlier this month, a senior US official also
told The Washington Post that Russia would likely gain control of
eastern Ukraine within weeks after doubling down on its military efforts
in the Donbas.

https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/06/22/world/russia-ukraine-war-news)-AT

[The battle for the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk **has
left both the Russian and Ukrainian armies severely
depleted**]{.underline}, offering a window into the bloody struggle
still to be fought for wider control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.
Russian forces are closing in on what would be their first significant
territorial gain in weeks in Ukraine, as they advance on the two cities,
the last major pieces of Luhansk province not to fall into Russian
hands. [Each side has suffered thousands of casualties and whole swaths
of the cities have been reduced to rubble.]{.underline} But capturing
all of Donbas would mean taking both Luhansk and neighboring Donetsk
province, and [the Russian advances in Donetsk in the past month have
been small]{.underline}. The capture of the twin cities would eliminate
an advantage the Ukrainians have in being able to use the Siversky
Donets River as a natural defensive barrier that Russian forces have
suffered heavy losses trying to cross. Even so, [the Russians would face
a difficult road to capturing towns and cities to the west]{.underline}
in Donetsk, including Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. [**Russian attempts to
advance on the region from the north remain stalled**, with both sides
trading a few miles of land each day in battles around the city of
Izium]{.underline}. [Military analysts have suggested that **heavy
losses by both sides already might necessitate an "operational pause" in
fighting** similar to the lull seen between late March and mid-April, as
Russia regrouped from its early failures to capture Kyiv, the capital,
and retreated from northern Ukraine.]{.underline} "**[There is evidence
that both sides, due to high numbers of casualties and ammunition
expenditure, are nearing exhaustion,]{.underline}**" Mick Ryan, a
retired Australian general and commander of the Australian Defence
College, wrote in a recent analysis. "An operational pause in the next
month or two is highly possible." Some military analysts have questioned
the wisdom of Ukraine investing so much blood and equipment to defend
territory with marginal strategic value. However, much as the
86-day-long fight for Mariupol forced Russia to devote resources to the
battle and gave Ukrainian forces in other parts of the country time to
mount a defense, the fight in Luhansk has bought them time, allowing for
more powerful weapons to flow into the country. The Ukrainians have
sought to take advantage of stretched Russian forces to set the stage
for counter offensives around Kherson in the south and Kharkiv in the
northeast. Control over southern Ukraine is central to Moscow's efforts
to strangle Ukraine economically, while holding the Kharkiv area is
critical to maintaining supply lines for its forces in the east. It
remains to be seen how the flow of Western weapons to Ukraine might
alter the strategic balance, but military analysts and the Ukrainians
say they will make any new Russian offensives much more costly, and
enable more counter offensives. For now, Russia continues to bombard
Ukrainian positions along the entire Donbas front. The Ukrainians
reported on Wednesday that 21 buildings in Donetsk were damaged in
Russian shelling over the past day, including a school and several
houses, leaving one person killed and 10 injured. "Massive air and
artillery strikes," had struck the region, President Volodymyr Zelensky
of Ukraine said in his address on Wednesday night. "The goal of the
occupiers in this direction remains the same --- they want to destroy
the whole Donbas step by step," he added. "They aim to turn any city
into Mariupol. Completely ruined."

RIGA, Latvia --- For Russia's urban middle class, the war on Ukraine has
messed up plans, ruined longed-for vacations and stripped away joys like
shopping for a favorite foreign clothing brand, turning the key in a new
Japanese car, even biting into a Big Mac. [**As** the **war drags on**,
**many yearn for life to go back to normal**, before prices went crazy
and foreign companies quit the country over Russia's
invasion]{.underline}. But these Russians are equally sure that
President Vladimir Putin will keep on fighting until he wins, ~because~
that's what he always does. After convincing the majority of the
population that the war was necessary to "liberate" Ukrainians from
"Nazis," state television propagandists are now doggedly preparing
Russians for a long war, ominously warning that it might end in nuclear
war. In Ukraine, that means more civilian casualties, bombed houses and
dozens of soldiers killed daily defending the country's east. [Russian
hardships may be trivial by contrast, but the deadening **gloom of a
long war worries the Kremlin**, according to analysts, **because of the
challenge of dragging the population along as sanctions bite, businesses
retrench, prices continue to surge, and it dawns on people that life may
never go back to the way it was**.]{.underline} But the old Kremlin
playbook, accusing the West of plans to gobble up Russia, is working so
far. Denis Volkov of independent polling agency Levada-Center said the
latest polling for April showed almost half of Russians unconditionally
support the war and about 30 percent support it with reservations, with
19 percent opposed. [Many in focus groups saw it as an existential
confrontation with the West, not Ukraine.]{.underline} "People explain
that a significant part of the world is against us and it's only Putin
who hopes to hold onto Russia, otherwise we would be eaten up
completely. To them it is Russia that is defending itself," he said.

[**The conflict**, however, **is taking a toll** **on Russians** like

changing the minds of a few friends and relatives who supported the war.
"But in general, it [seems **everyone is sick and tired of the war** or
special operation**. People have their own problems and the main problem
is survival**, especially with the rising prices."]{.underline} Marina
acknowledged that few Russians are opposed to the war and most are
finding a way to "get by somehow." But she added: "This 'somehow' is
becoming boring. Most people got tired of it. I want to travel. Others
want to be able to plan. We want to get back to our ordinary lives."

her old life --- just a few months ago. "I want to be able to watch
Western movies on Netflix and shop at Uniqlo. I want to travel to Europe
on affordable and reliable airlines. [I **want to be part of the world
and not an outcast**]{.underline}," she said. Many people, still in
denial, are struggling to adapt, said Grigory Yudin, professor of
political philosophy at the Moscow School of Social and Economic
Sciences. "The natural question for Russians is not whether I support it
or not --- nobody asks you, actually --- but how do I adapt to this?"

People want certainty about their incomes, travel plans and mortgages.
[Part of the **Moscow elite**, including middle-ranking bureaucrats who
feel they are Europeans, **are not happy about the war**, he said, but
tend to believe Putin will fight until he wins.]{.underline} "I think
the majority of Russians still honestly believe that this is going on
with military success, or at least this is what people want to believe,"
Yudin said. He added: "The more-educated people who are more informed
and tend to consume information from different sources are not that
certain about that. They have significant doubts." Volkov said the
latest polling showed interest in watching news about the war is
beginning to wane, with people in focus groups wishing their lives could
go back to the way they were. "[The **best scenario is for this to end
as soon as possible** **and** then we hope **things will go back to
normal**,"]{.underline} said Ksenia, 50, a bookkeeper at a firm that
sells foreign materials and has been hard hit by Western sanctions. Most
of her work colleagues began strongly supporting the war, but lately
they avoid the subject, except to complain that ordinary people in
Russia always pay the price of government decisions. "My colleagues have
finally started to realize that things are not great. In general, we try
not to discuss it because we start to fight. They're saying, 'We didn't
start this war and now we have to pay.'" Her plan to vacation in the
United States or Italy this summer is ruined because she cannot get a
visa. "Now I feel as if there's no future and it's very depressing." She
ached when McDonalds' golden arches were removed not for any love of the
burgers or fries, but for the idea it represented. "I'm really upset
about McDonald's, and I really mean it. McDonald's has always been a
symbol of freedom for me. I remember when the first McDonald's opened in
Moscow," she said recalling the queues in 1990s months before the Soviet
Union collapsed. "It felt like the light at the end of the tunnel."

**while** his **income halved**.]{.underline} Viktor thought war would
rage about two months. "[Now it will take years, and it's a disaster.
It's **not only losing lives**. In the years to come we will be **living
in poverty and we will be hated again like the fascists in Germany in
World War II** --- like we are the new fascists."]{.underline} But
43-year-old Andrei from Moscow sees the war as "God's plan" and believes
Russians are willing to make sacrifices to see it through. A
yoga-loving, vegetarian computer programmer, he is not the typical
elderly, conservative Putin supporter. He gets his news from one
pro-Kremlin blogger and shares a common Russian conviction that Western
news of Russian war crimes is "fake." He declined to give his surname.
"The idea is to remove fascism from Ukraine and to return the civilians
who want to live in the U.S.S.R., like before the '90s," he said echoing
the propaganda. "Right now we don't feel any meaningful impact from
sanctions," he added, although many of his friends in IT have fled for
Armenia and elsewhere, and he can no longer afford to buy a beloved
MacBook computer. Nor can he purchase the new Mazda 6 he had his eyes
on; he had been hoping pay about 2 million rubles --- five months'
salary --- but the price went up to 3 million. Andrei is convinced that
Russia will win the war in a year or so, prices will fall and Apple
products will find their way to Russia via the black market. Until then,
he says he'll make sacrifices (but not volunteer to fight.) "Western
people like comfort, they need comfort," he said. "Russian people may
have comfort, or they may not. This is not a problem." Political analyst
and journalist Fyodor Krasheninnikov said many Russians hope that
Ukraine would soon capitulate to Russian military power. "[**The mood in
Russia now** **is** that '**We want this to be over as soon as possible
because we just can't live like this any longer.** We want to get back
to normal life,]{.underline}'" he said. "It's not that people really
like what Putin does," he continued. "No, but they feel frustration and
depression because they cannot change anything. It's like bad weather.
They realize that it's going to rain every day. But what can they do
about it?"

[The **EU's response has been swift and unprecedented**]{.underline}.
The first package of sanctions was already agreed on 23 February, a day
before the invasion began. Three more sanction packages have followed,
including restrictive measures on individuals with close links to the
Putin regime, severe economic sanctions, diplomatic measures, and
restrictions on economic cooperation as well as on Russian media
outlets. Indeed, the EU's reaction has gone beyond sanctions. Under the
European Peace Facility, the EU has agreed to support the Ukrainian
resistance with a set of assistance measures ranging from personal
protection equipment, first aid kits, fuel and military equipment to
defensive platforms designed to deliver lethal force. [Plans to
eliminate the dependency on Russian fossil fuel imports have triggered
discussions on how to secure stable energy supplies and on possible
measures to mitigate against the impact of high energy prices. This is
**part of a wider set of responses among the members of the
transatlantic alliance**.]{.underline} NATO has long struggled to find a
raison d'être following the fall of the Iron Curtain. [Russia's
willingness to use military force has **put NATO back in the spotlight,
rejuvenating the alliance and catalysing a dramatic increase in European
defence spending**,]{.underline} most notably in Germany. Support for
NATO membership is rising in hitherto neutral countries such as Sweden
and Finland. Individual countries have also imposed their own sanctions
on Russia while sending weapons, ammunition, medical supplies and
financial assistance to Ukraine. The civic response to the humanitarian
crisis has been spectacular. Ukraine's European neighbours have kept
their borders open to Ukrainian refugees, demonstrating compassion and
solidarity. This has been reinforced at the EU level: financial support
packages for EU countries sheltering Ukrainian refugees have been
approved and assistance such as medical supplies, tents and generators
has been made available via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. EU
ministers have also agreed to offer people fleeing from the war in
Ukraine temporary protection and to share equally the burden for
receiving refugees arriving at the EU's external borders. It is too
early to say whether Russia's invasion of Ukraine represents a
historical turning point for European integration. During historical
turning points, the demand for collective solutions to shared problems
intensifies, paving the way for rapid institutional development. They
create a stimulus for institutional adaptation and change.
[Decision-makers are more focused, established structures may be found
wanting, new avenues may be explored. The Ukraine war has altered the
political, strategic and economic framework conditions for European
regional cooperation and transatlantic relations]{.underline}. Perhaps
not without a sense of irony, Moscow's aggression has reminded the
European bloc of its Cold War origins. Indeed, long distrustful of
Russia, some of the smaller states of Europe have been the most
enthusiastic supporters of NATO in recent years. The war has highlighted
the multidimensional nature of security issues and the highly integrated
nature of the two main pillars of the Western alliance system: NATO (and
the inbuilt transatlantic partnership) and the EU. **[The war will
provide a renewed impetus for the EU's Common Foreign and Security
Policy and for enhanced EU-NATO cooperation]{.underline}**. Russia's
invasion is also deeply symbolic, representing an assault at the very
normative foundation of the European integration project -- on its
values of democracy, human rights, freedom and the rule of law. The war
was, at least in part, triggered by the Ukrainian attempt to break free
from Moscow's shadow, seeking a democratic and European future. Moscow
has been suspicious of the changes sweeping through Ukraine since the
2014 Maidan Revolution. There are some obvious parallels to the 1968
Prague Spring. Czechoslovakia's removal of the Soviet-backed regime and
the launching of political and economic reforms was regarded as a threat
to Soviet influence. Soviet tanks and troops eventually crushed the
reformers. Just over half a century later, Russian tanks have once again
been sent towards a European capital. It is important to remember that
European integration emerged out of the ashes of World War II and the
ensuing Cold War in the form of a network of interconnected and
criss-crossing institutions such as the European Coal and Steel
Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), the
forerunners of the EU, and including institutions with a membership
beyond Europe such as NATO, the Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Organisation for European Economic
Co-operation / Organisation for European Co-operation and Development
(OEEC/OECD) and the Council of Europe. Similarly, the sudden end of the
Cold War also represented a significant historical turning point for
European integration. Almost overnight, the political order created by
the Iron Curtain vanished. This left the future of the Western alliance
system, including transatlantic relations, uncertain. This situation has
now changed once again and it may well be that the Ukraine war has
inadvertently provided the impetus for a refocusing of European
integration and a rejuvenation of the transatlantic alliance.

Tensions between Russia and the West appear to have risen dramatically
over the last week. In the last few days alone, Russia stopped gas
supplies to two European countries and has warned the West several times
that the risk of a nuclear war is very "real." Russian President
Vladimir Putin said that any foreign intervention in Ukraine would
provoke what he called a "lightning fast" response from Moscow. The
saber-rattling and rhetoric between Moscow and the West have become
notably more aggressive this week, prompting concerns that a direct
confrontation between the two power blocs could be more likely. In the
last few days alone, for example, Russia stopped gas supplies to two
European countries and has warned the West several times that the risk
of a nuclear war is very "real." [In addition, [Russian President

that** **any foreign intervention in Ukraine** **would** **provoke**
what he called **a** "lightning **fast" response from Moscow**, while
his Foreign Ministry warned NATO not to test its patience.]{.underline}
For their part, Western officials have dismissed Russia's "bravado" and
"dangerous" nuclear war rhetoric, with the U.K. calling on Western
allies to "double down" on their support for Ukraine. CNBC asked
strategists about the likelihood of a direct confrontation between
Russia and the West. Here's what they said. Nuclear attack? At the start
of the week, Russia's foreign minister warned that the threat of a
nuclear war "cannot be underestimated" and said NATO's supply of weapons
to Ukraine was tantamount to the military alliance engaging in a proxy
war with Russia. Putin doubled down on the bellicose rhetoric Wednesday,
threatening a "lightning fast" retaliation against any country
intervening in [the Ukraine
war](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html)
and creating what he called "strategic threats for Russia." He then
appeared to allude to Russia's arsenal of intercontinental ballistic
missiles and nuclear weapons when he warned that Russia has the "tools"
for a retaliatory response "that no one else can boast of having now
\... we will use them if necessary." But [strategists told CNBC that
Putin is playing on risk aversion in the West and that the chances of a
nuclear war are remote.]{.underline} "I think it's outside the realm of
possibility right now that there's going to be a nuclear war or World
War III that really spills over that far beyond Ukraine's borders,"
Samuel Ramani, a geopolitical analyst and associate fellow at the Royal
United Services Institute, told CNBC. ["If there's a border spillover
right now, we're still probably most likely looking at something like
Moldova being vulnerable to an invasion," he said. He noted that Russia
has a long history of using "nuclear brinkmanship" as a way of
preventing the West from pursuing security policies that it doesn't
like, with the escalation in hostile rhetoric aimed at deterring NATO
members from making heavy arms deliveries to Ukraine.]{.underline}
Moment of danger Nonetheless, Ramani noted the threat posed by Russia
could become more acute if it felt humiliated on the battlefield. In
particular, military setbacks in Ukraine around May 9 could pose some
danger. That's Russia's "Victory Day" --- the anniversary of Nazi
Germany's defeat by the Soviet Union in World War II. "Putin has had a
history of escalating unpredictability if he feels that Russia is being
humiliated in some way \... and if there are major setbacks, especially
on around the 9th \[of May\] then there's a risk of unbreakable action,"
he said. "But also there's a logic of mutually assured destruction that
hopefully will rein everybody in." [Threatening nuclear attacks is part
of Putin's "playbook," said William Alberque, director of strategy,
technology and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic
Studies think tank. "Putin enjoys using risks and he thinks he has a
much more appetite for risk than the West does," he told CNBC on
Thursday. "He's trying to use the old playbook of 'if I terrify you
enough, you'll back down'," he said.]{.underline} "Ultimately, if he
uses nuclear weapons, even a demonstration strike, this would turn
Russia into a global pariah," Alberque said. He advised Western leaders,
"We just need to be able to manage our risk and keep our nerve and not
panic when he does something that we might not expect." There's no
indication that there will be a direct confrontation, Liviu Horovitz, a
nuclear policy researcher at the German Institute for International and
Security Affairs, told CNBC. ["Both the **United States and Western
European** governments **have** repeatedly **said that they have no
interest in escalating this conflict beyond Ukraine,** and I don't see
anything suggesting that NATO troops will be fighting in Ukraine anytime
soon."]{.underline} Still, if a wider war did break out, ["NATO's
overall conventional capabilities outmatch Russia's,"]{.underline} he
noted. What's important now is that "all sides should avoid any steps
that could create misunderstandings," he said --- steps that could lead
to an accidental and potentially catastrophic war. Economic war [While
NATO has shied away from providing any aid to Ukraine that could be
misconstrued as a direct attack on Russia, Western allies continue to
pile on the pressure on Moscow.]{.underline} Indeed[, **the economic
punishment on Russia has been increasing**]{.underline} by the day, in
the form of more sanctions on its businesses, key sectors and officials
close to or within Putin's regime. [**Russia's** own **Economy
Ministry** **expects the economy to contract** as a result, **by 8.8% in
2022** in its base-case scenario, **or by 12.4%**]{.underline} in a more
conservative scenario, [Reuters
reported.](https://www.reuters.com/business/russias-gdp-decline-could-hit-124-this-year-economy-ministry-document-shows-2022-04-27/)
For its part, [Russia has sought to inflict its own pain on European
countries that are]{.underline}, awkwardly, [heavily reliant on Russian
natural gas imports]{.underline}. This week [[it suspended supplies to
Poland and Bulgaria because they refused to pay for the gas in
rubles]{.underline}](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/27/russias-gas-supplies-to-poland-bulgaria-uncertain-as-tensions-rise.html).
Russia's move was branded as "blackmail" by the EU but defended by
Moscow. While a direct confrontation between Russia and the West remains
unlikely, one close Russia watcher said Western governments need to
imbue their populations with a "war mentality" to prepare them for the
hardships they could face as the economic fallout from the war
continues. [Those include rising energy costs and disrupted supply
chains and goods from Russia and Ukraine, among the world's biggest
"bread baskets."]{.underline} "We're likely to see a further escalation
of the economic war, because in some ways, that's a rational and logical
move from both sides that have a very difficult time fighting one
another in a direct way because of the nuclear escalation risks,"
Maximilian Hess, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told
CNBC on Thursday. ["**Russia will cut off gas to more countries,** **it
will increase its ruble demands**, because it wants to ensure the ruble
convertibility remains open, **and the West needs** **to** be
**prepar**ing for this with a full war mentality, making the Western
populations understand that this is going to have real economic costs
and real impacts on the cost of goods, the cost of living and inflation
over the coming years."]{.underline} "If we don't take this war
mentality and apply it to the economic war, then it becomes a lot easier
for Putin to win and have successes there," Hess said. Other flashpoints
to watch After more than two months of war, [Russia has expanded its
control of territories in eastern and southern Ukraine, trying to create
a land bridge from Russia via the Donbas region to its annexed territory
of Crimea. But **it has also sustained large losses in terms of manpower
and** **arms**.]{.underline} In the meantime, [[the West continues to
pledge more and more support for
Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/28/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html),
and the country's forces are mounting a strong resistance to Russian
troops, signaling a protracted and bloody conflict ahead]{.underline}.
NATO's chief, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Thursday that the war in Ukraine
could last for years. Andrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor
at Teneo Intelligence, said that against this backdrop, "there is no end
in sight to Russia's war in Ukraine, and relations with the West will
likely continue to deteriorate." ["The rhetoric in Russia is already
shifting from statements of fighting the 'nationalists' in Ukraine to an
alleged (proxy) war with NATO]{.underline}. Multiple flashpoints could
further escalate the tensions with the West," he said. Those include
recent explosions in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria
(which could serve as a pretext for an increased Russian presence in the
region) which could bring the conflict "dangerously close to NATO's
borders," Tursa said in a note Wednesday. ["Moscow could also step up
threats to NATO over weapons supplies to Ukraine, especially after
multiple military and energy facilities in Russia have been allegedly
hit by Ukraine. Finally, **decisions by Finland and Sweden to join NATO
would be perceived by Moscow as another security threat to Russia and
could increase military tensions in the Baltic region."**]{.underline}

Zelensky has [repeatedly called for a Nato-enforced "no-fly zone" over
Ukraine. But Nato leaders have concluded, understandably, that this
risks direct military confrontation between Russia and Nato forces,
potentially leading to rapid escalation]{.underline}. The same seems to
apply to another of Zelensky's requests -- the supply of aircraft to
help the Ukrainian air force. But [if Nato were to directly provide
aircraft to Ukraine, Russia may very well conclude that this is
offensive, rather than defensive, weaponry, and take action to stop the
supply of planes. This may involve strikes on airfields where the planes
are based -- for example, in Poland -- before they are moved to
Ukraine.]{.underline} There's a chance that Zelensky has called for a
Nato-sponsored no-fly zone precisely because he knows it would be
impossible, [allowing him to begin distancing himself from the idea of
Nato membership for Ukraine]{.underline}. This might give him the
negotiating room to conclude an agreement with Russia. But at the same
time, he reminded America in his speech to the US Congress of the Pearl
Harbour and 9/11 attacks. Zelensky is warning of the consequences of
continued Nato inaction. Article 5 Nato membership allows a nation to
invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty to call for support from
the other members fof the alliance. This article has only been used once
in Nato's history -- by the US, following the attacks on New York and
Washington DC on September 11, 2001 But Article 5 does not guarantee
that all the other Nato states would send armed forces to repel an
attack, only that military action is an option which can be included as
part of the alliance's principle of "collective defence". Given public
statements from Westminster, the UK would be expected to honour its
obligation to fight a Russian attack. As the UK's health secretary,
Sajid Javid, said only a few days ago in an interview on LBC: "**[If a
single Russian toecap steps into Nato territory there will be war with
Nato."]{.underline}** On February 25, one day after Russian forces
invaded Ukraine, Nato heads of government met in Brussels. They produced
a statement **[deploring the invasion and pledging aid for
Ukraine]{.underline}**. The alliance pledged to "continue to take all
measures and decisions required to ensure the security and defence of
all allies". **[Accordingly, Nato has deployed both land and maritime
assets across its eastern regions and "activated NATO's defence plans to
prepare ourselves to respond to a range of contingencies and secure
alliance territory".]{.underline}** My research on Nato has involved
informal discussions with several officers from various member nations.
This has led me to believe that some Nato countries further from the
conflict zone might be reluctant to send combat forces -- even in the
event that Article 5 is triggered. There is also the question of whether
**[Nato's political leaders would be willing to carry out attacks on
Russian soil]{.underline}**, which would represent a significant
intensification of the conflict and would c**[arry the additional risk
that Russia might respond by escalating to nuclear or chemical
weapons]{.underline}**. **[Deterrence -- whether conventional or nuclear
-- requires rational calculation by both sides. As I have written
before, Putin's rationality is different to that of western leaders,
which is part of the reason why this crisis and conflict happened in the
first place. So far, Putin has not been deterred by Nato. Instead, he
has threatened the alliance with "consequences you have never seen in
history".]{.underline}**

Article 5 specifies that any attack on any of the member countries is
effectively an attack against them all. Through the Cold War, when the
alliance sought to contain the expansion of the Soviet Union, it served
as a deterrent. But in the current conflict, its violation is a
guarantee of escalation on a nightmarish scale. [Even NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said that NATO allies have a
responsibility "to prevent this war from escalating beyond
Ukraine]{.underline}." "The alliance doesn\'t want to invoke Article 5
because it doesn't want to have a war with Russia," says Stanley Sloan,
a visiting scholar in political science at Vermont's Middlebury College
and author of Defense of the West: NATO, the European Union and the
Transatlantic Bargain. "[The best protection against having to do that
is Ukrainian success,]{.underline}" Sloan says. "So that's one reason
why the United States and the allies are trying to do everything
possible without getting directly involved in the conflict that they can
do to help the Ukrainians succeed." What is Article 5 and How Does it
Operate? The alliance calls Article 5 the "**[principle of collective
defense at the very heart of NATO's founding treaty]{.underline}**."
Since it was signed in 1949, **[the alliance has been so powerful and so
effective that Article 5 has only needed to be invoked
once]{.underline}** -- after the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. The charter
stipulates that member countries will assist the attacked party "by
taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties,
such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area."
[Importantly, each nation gets to determine how they will respond, Sloan
says. It's not an automatic commitment to do anything specific in terms
of an attack.]{.underline}

### 1nc -- no WW3 !

#### No risk of WW3 -- the conflict won't go nuclear 

**Simhony 22** (Limor Simhony\-- a policy advisor and researcher based
in London, "NATO Intervention in Ukraine Won't Spark World War III"
Foreign Policy 4/1/22
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/01/nato-intervention-in-ukraine-wont-spark-world-war-iii/)

Liberal democracies have war fatigue. It has been demonstrated by
disengagement and withdrawal from conflicts (like in Afghanistan) and
limited interventions (like in Syria, Libya, and Yemen), where Western
forces reduced dependence on ground forces and concentrated on
airstrikes and assistance to other fighting forces, such as the Saudis
in Yemen and rebels in Syria. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014
passed with few consequences for Russia, and as Russia prepared to
invade the rest of Ukraine on Feb. 24, it was clear that Western nations
would stick to a policy of nonengagement.

Sanctions against Russia have been severe, and Ukrainian forces have
been receiving weapons, equipment, and valuable intelligence from
Western nations, which have allowed them to deploy unexpected force
against Russian troops---fiercely contesting their invasion and causing
thousands of casualties, loss of tanks, and other armored vehicles,
rocket launchers, aircraft, and ships. Diplomatic efforts to keep Russia
isolated have also been crucial. [However, Russia's indiscriminate
attacks against Ukrainian civilians---including bombing hospitals and
schools as well as the use of horrific weapons, such as cluster bombs
and white phosphorus---should drive the West to reevaluate its war
engagement policy and take a more active role by implementing a no-fly
zone or securing evacuation corridors---perhaps even actively fighting
Russian forces. **The** main **concern** **is** any such **escalation
could lead to World War III.** There are **two reasons that this is
unlikely**]{.underline}. [The first is that **Russia's military
capabilities are poor** relative to those of Western armies. **Their
forces are not** sufficiently **trained**; their **equipment and weapons
are dated and inferior; they experience major logistical, operational,
and tactical difficulties; and their soldiers have low
morale**.]{.underline} The expectation that Moscow could escalate the
war into other theaters in an effective way, especially by conventional
means, is unrealistic. **[Damaging economic sanctions also mean that
Russia may not be able to fund a wider war]{.underline}**. [The
expectation that Moscow will be able **to escalate the war** into other
theaters in an effective way, especially by conventional means**, is
unrealistic.**]{.underline} It is possible that [if the Russian military
continues to struggle, Russian President Vladimir Putin will deploy
chemical or even nuclear weapons to increase gains and deter the West
from interfering---but that is unlikely.]{.underline} The second is that
[Russia has become isolated]{.underline}. [To fight a world war,
**Russia needs powerful allies, which it does not have. Its strongest
ally, China, has largely remained on the sidelines since the war
started**]{.underline}. It abstained from voting against the [U.N.
resolution](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113152) demanding that
Russia ends its offensive, and it is worried about secondary sanctions
if it aids Russia. [**The only countries besides Russia** that voted to
reject the resolution **were Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, and
Syria---hardly a winning alliance.**]{.underline} Both world wars saw
blocks of powerful allies fight one another. Currently, such a bloc does
not exist on Russia's side. [These factors mean that there is not a high
risk of substantial escalation into total global war.]{.underline} This
should be enough to convince Western nations to change their engagement
policy and help Ukraine win the war by repulsing an opponent that is
considerably inferior militarily to their own forces. [It is unlikely to
happen for two main reasons: fear of Russian nukes and the West's
aversion to casualties.]{.underline} The most widely discussed reason is
the concern that Russia will use nuclear weapons if NATO intervenes
militarily. Putin has reasserted Russia's right to use nuclear weapons
in Ukraine, making this a legitimate concern. However, it is more likely
that nuclear deterrence---albeit different to Cold War deterrence---will
hold. Russia's deployment of nuclear weapons, either against Ukraine or
against a NATO member state, could incur devastating consequences for
Russia. As then-U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said in 2018,
dismissing the notion that tactical nuclear weapons are somehow a lesser
threat, "Any nuclear weapon used ... is a strategic game-changer."
Therefore, if NATO retaliates with a powerful response, either nuclear
or conventional, it may target strategic Russian military positions and
perhaps even sites of political power, aiming at wiping out Russian
military capabilities and targeting those in positions of authority---a
move that could threaten Putin's leadership. A NATO retaliation should
therefore be considered a major threat to Putin, especially because
rivals include numerous nations with considerable nuclear capabilities,
such as the United States, United Kingdom, and France. Sensitivity to
casualties---specifically deaths among troops---has become a major
element affecting liberal democracies' war preparedness, use of force,
and decision-making. In addition, at the heart of this conflict stands
national identity. [Putin has little motivation to devastate a county
that he wishes to annex and has not knowingly made any preparations for
using nuclear weapons.]{.underline} Fear of the bomb accounts for one
reason behind the West's decision to leave Ukraine to fight on its own.
Another consideration is fundamental to the West: casualty sensitivity.
[Sensitivity to casualties---specifically deaths among troops---has
become a major element affecting liberal democracies' war preparedness,
use of force, and decision-making regarding participation in
wars.]{.underline} The trauma of Britain's so-called lost generation
followed the loss of 750,000 troops in World War I. It overwhelmed the
public and affected interwar foreign policy and military preparedness in
a misguided attempt to avoid another war. The same happened in other
liberal democracies scarred by the war, such as France, whereas
countries with shallower liberal and democratic traditions---such as
Germany, which suffered heavier losses than France and
Britain---consequently gravitated toward fascism and reverted to
militarism. Conflict behavior and public attitudes toward wars have
undergone deep changes during the 20th and 21st centuries as a result of
extensive liberalization and democratization processes. Liberal concepts
of individualism, personal freedoms, a reduction in internal violence,
and a comfortable lifestyle that includes longer life expectancy brought
about changes in attitudes about war---primarily, that it is an
undesirable way to resolve conflicts. Rejecting the violence and
suffering that comes with it has made it difficult for leaders of
liberal democracies to justify to the public participation in wars,
especially wars of choice, in which the nation is not under direct
threat. The United States' interventions in Vietnam, Lebanon, Somalia,
and Iraq, for example, were shaped by the casualties incurred. The 1983
bombing of the Marine Corps barracks in Lebanon that killed 241 U.S.
service members and the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, where 18 U.S. soldiers
died, provoked powerful reactions against the missions, bringing them to
an abrupt end despite them initially enjoying wide public support. A
similar reaction came after the Tet Offensive in Vietnam in January
1968, which resulted in 1,500 American fatalities. It was a watershed
moment that changed the debate about the war and led to the shelving of
plans for escalation. Support for the second war in Iraq also fell
dramatically as deaths mounted, causing the American public to question
the necessity of the war or its conduct and chances of success. Alliance
leaders stressed none of its forces would be deployed into Ukraine to
prevent the conflict's spread. Firefighters sit amid debris in the area
of a research institute, part of Ukraine\'s National Academy of
Sciences, after a strike by drones, in northwestern Kyiv. Powerful
threats could too easily become real disasters. Israel's use of force
against Hezbollah in Lebanon has been heavily influenced by casualty
aversion. This included an overreliance on air power in an attempt to
limit fatalities among ground forces during the 2006 Lebanon War at the
price of undermining military effectiveness. Then-Israeli Chief of Staff
Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz famously commented: "We didn't send ground troops
into Lebanon because the public couldn't stomach any more deaths."
Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon, where forces had been
deployed between 1985 and 2000, was also heavily influenced by the
public's dissatisfaction with the casualties incurred, particularly
after several costly incidents during the 1990s undermined support for a
continued military presence and enhanced criticism of the government.
Nondemocracies and guerrilla and terrorist organizations do not exhibit
the West's aversion to casualties. Nondemocracies and guerrilla and
terrorist organizations do not exhibit such an aversion to casualties.
During the Iran-Iraq War, both sides callously scarified children by
using them as human minesweepers and shields. Similarly, both the Viet
Cong in Vietnam and Hezbollah in Lebanon showed considerable willingness
to sacrifice lives despite suffering more losses than their liberal
enemies. Then-Egyptian President Anwar Sadat famously said, "Egypt would
sacrifice a million Egyptian soldiers" during the October 1973 war
against Israel despite not facing an existential threat or serious
strategic concerns. [There has been little evidence to suggest there is
heightened sensitivity to losses among troops in Russia, a nation with a
history of mass deaths in both the world wars, its own civil war, and
from the brutal suppression and killing of its own people]{.underline}.
The continued use of force in Ukraine, which has resulted in as many as
15,000 Russian military deaths so far according to the [Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/24/russia-troops-casualties-nato-ukraine/),
indicates that casualties are of no concern to Russia's top brass. This
stands in contrast to Ukraine, which accepts its causalities because it
is fighting an existential war for independence and national survival.
Casualty sensitivity has been one of the factors shaping democracies'
behavior, with Western politicians preferring to avoid direct engagement
in wars or to limit the use of ground forces, even at the price of
compromising objectives and deterrence. It is one of the reasons that a
policy of nonengagement was adopted, without question or hesitation,
regarding Ukraine, long before Putin raised the alert status of Russia's
nuclear arsenal. Fear of casualties among soldiers meant that a policy
of nonengagement has existed prior to Russia's invasion---and therefore
separately to a concern about escalating into a broader war. This has
been understood by Putin, who bet---correctly---that Western nations
will not take an active role in the war by using direct force against
Russian troops, not only out of fear of escalation but as a result of a
preexisting doctrine that seeks to minimize casualties. Had the West
exhibited less casualty aversion, this could have acted as a greater
deterrent against Russian aggression. For the war in Ukraine, unlike the
risk of escalation and use of nuclear weapons, the risk of incurring
casualties is high. Considering how formative aversion to casualties has
been, committing troops to fight Russia will require liberal democracies
to undergo a major paradigm shift. But there are ways to mitigate the
effect of casualty sensitivity on public opinion. Adjusting the public's
expectations regarding the length of the war and the casualties that
will result as well as displaying internal political unity could help.
Employing force that relies primarily on air power, which limits
casualties, can be used; during Israel's 2006 war in Lebanon and other
wars, this has proved to have only limited effectiveness. However, if
done in collaboration with Ukrainian ground forces, this could have
better chances of success. This war brought a shift in attitudes toward
wars in Europe. The Germans, famously pacifist since 1945, have
undergone the largest shift and now support military aid to Ukraine and
a considerable increase in funds to rebuild Germany's military power.
But a bigger shift is needed considering Russia's aggression. Russia is
no stranger to targeting civilians, as it has done in the carpet-bombing
of Grozny in Chechnya, in 1994 to 1995 and 1999 to 2000. It is doing
this again now. It is time for the West to stop being afraid of limited
threats that are not likely to materialize and to use its military
superiority to help Ukraine defend its independence. Intervention will
not turn this local conflict into World War III. It runs the risk of
causing a tactical nuclear attack on Ukraine, but this risk is limited
given what any retaliation could mean for Russia. The West must
therefore decide how long it will refrain from engagement and allow
Russia to sow devastation in pursuing expansionist ambitions for fear of
casualties or the bomb.

After a few days, [**the Russian invasion of Ukraine has stumbled amid**
reports **of low troop morale and poor logistics**.]{.underline} The
bungled Russian invasion has given space for different European
countries t[o increase lethal
assistance](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ukraine-russia-funding-weapons-budget-military-aid/)
to the Ukrainian government, but this raises the risk of escalation
beyond Ukraine. Such overt assistance has prompted Moscow [to
warn](https://twitter.com/m_suchkov/status/1497961761554710531) that it
would strike any arms convoys inside Ukrainian territory, presumably
with airstrikes near the Ukrainian-Polish border. There is a non-trivial
risk of conventional escalation that could turn a contained, regional
conflict into a much larger regional war. The United States and Europe
ought to take action to reduce these risks even as they supply Ukraine
with lethal and non-lethal supplies. The West cannot afford to be
sanguine about the increased risk of direct conflict with Russia. [The
United States and its NATO allies are also flying in close, daily
contact with the Russian and Belarusian air forces while NATO troops are
deployed in [Poland and
Romania](https://www.airforcemag.com/u-s-jets-deployed-to-poland-romania-prepared-to-scramble-in-support-of-nato-baltic-air-policing/)]{.underline}.
Additionally, the primary route for Western weapons to reach Ukraine is
via Poland. Western policymakers would be wise to consider [that Russian
aerospace forces may bomb convoys entering Ukraine from Poland, raising
the possibility that they or their munitions could strike targets just
outside the border, or even cross into Polish airspace]{.underline}. And
as the war moves west, [Russian fighters could pursue Ukrainian aircraft
fleeing the conflict and, perhaps, violate Polish air
space]{.underline}. Hot pursuit of aircraft over international borders
invites retaliation, potentially bringing NATO and Russian forces into
combat. As such, [policymakers ought to be clear and deliberate about
how to manage potential escalation spirals.]{.underline} While both
sides have professional militaries that are governed by rules managing
these interactions, NATO air forces will almost certainly be operating
in ever-closer proximity to Russian aircraft, at the very least. [The
airspace surrounding Romania and Poland is [already
congested](https://breakingdefense.com/2022/02/us-russia-should-establish-deconfliction-line-for-air-operations-over-the-black-sea-now/),
with different NATO forces patrolling over the Black and Baltic Seas, as
well as in the tri-border area between Belarus, Ukraine, and
Poland.]{.underline} To complicate matters further, Ukrainian air assets
have fled to [Poland and
Romania](https://militarywatchmagazine.com/article/one-of-ukraine-s-top-fighters-fled-to-romania-as-russia-dominates-skies-what-will-happen-to-the-runaway-su-27).
This means that [Soviet-designed aircraft are flying at NATO members'
borders, which requires NATO air forces to identify them and escort them
to an appropriate air base. As of now, Russian fighters are not pursuing
these aircrafts, perhaps because they have not gained air superiority
over Ukraine and are not patrolling in the far west of the
country.]{.underline} If the conflict was to escalate or were NATO to
decide to reassess its aims and rules of engagement --- perhaps in
response to Russian forces pushing westward after taking or encircling
Kyiv, driving a tide of fleeing refugees before them --- things could
get much more dangerous. [**The risk of spillover from the conflict is
an urgent topic for discussion precisely because it could lead to a war
involving up to four nuclear-armed powers: Russia, the United States,
France, and the United Kingdom**.]{.underline} President Vladimir Putin
has already put his nuclear forces on ["a special mode of combat
duty"](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/27/with-his-war-going-slowly-vladimir-putin-raises-the-nuclear-stakes)
in an attempt to coerce the Western powers. This order has puzzled
observers of Russian nuclear forces, but the signaling appears to be
designed to warn NATO to stay out of the conflict, something Biden has
pledged to do, rather than signal Moscow's willingness to use nuclear
force first. **While [the threat of a nuclear exchange is
low]{.underline}**[,]{.underline} the United States and Europe must
grapple with the secondary challenges of military support for Ukraine.
Russian warnings have suggested that it intends to limit actions to
Ukraine, **while [the Biden administration [has
insisted](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/caitlinhernandez/biden-us-troops-russia-ukraine)
it will not send troops into the conflict]{.underline}**. The line,
however, is becoming increasingly blurred with the increasing pledges to
support the Ukrainian armed forces. Foreign supplied man-portable
weapons are already tearing into Russian supply lines and [killing
Russians](https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/frustrated-putin-may-order-escalation-violence-ukraine-us-officials-sa-rcna18026)
in numbers larger than what the Kremlin may have accepted before the
invasion, and the networks being set up to supply these weapons could
easily be used to support a Ukrainian insurgency indefinitely. How will
Moscow react once these arms flows from Poland turn from trickles to
torrents, or kill Russian soldiers tasked with patrolling conquered
urban areas? NATO aerial patrols over Poland are well within the
engagement zone of Belarusian surface-to-air missiles. In the event of
increased tensions, Belarus, under instructions from the Kremlin, could
use its surface-to-air missiles to harass NATO fighters, or consider
trying to interfere by jamming aircraft. The other, and perhaps most
likely, pressure point will be on the supply convoys from Poland into
Ukraine. In Syria, Russia used tactical bombers [to strike weapons and
food
supplies](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/syriasource/how-russia-beat-turkey-in-syria/)
from Turkey, as part of its siege campaign of Aleppo. This tactic led to
Russian bombing directly on the border. In the air, Russian fighters
would also [use aggressive
tactics](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/us-war-against-isis-9780755634828/)
to warn away coalition fighters during times of tension (often with
little effect), as well as Turkish Air Force fighters patrolling near
the border. If the war drags on, and Western supplies do start to make
it into the country in larger numbers, NATO should expect
Ukrainian-driven convoys with Western aid to be bombed. Russia has
pledged to do this, and it would be wise to take Putin seriously. The
Russian strategy now, it seems, is to mass forces to besiege Ukrainian
cities. As part of this strategy, one should assume Moscow will attempt
to cut weapons supplies to Ukraine, even if those supplies come from
Poland. The Russian military has performed poorly in Ukraine, but there
is little reason to doubt that Moscow can use mass to overcome
challenges and take terrain from the Ukrainian military. If this were to
happen, Russian military forces could soon
[link](https://warontherocks.com/2022/02/interpreting-the-first-few-days-of-the-russo-ukrainian-war/)
different fronts in the south and east, besiege Kyiv, and be in a
position to expand the war in the western part of the country. This
reality, while unsettling, requires that the United States and NATO
think through the risks of increased Russian activity on the
Ukrainian-Polish border. To manage this risk, the United States and NATO
should announce that no member-state's territory will be used to launch
attacks against the Russian armed forces. The two sides should also
continue to push for increased transparency about air operations on the
border with Belarus, decreasing the risk of miscalculation on the
border. Finally, the United States and Europe should decide how to
respond if convoys are bombed. The easiest answer is [to do
nothing](https://warontherocks.com/2017/12/in-defense-of-nothing/).
However, the pressure to do "something" to protect these convoys is
likely to grow, leading to pressures on leaders to extend some sort of
protection to aid and weapons convoys that enter Ukraine, even when any
such action could be escalatory. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has
gone poorly thus far, but the correlation of forces still slants heavily
in Moscow's favor. And Putin will likely increase the brutality of his
campaign, substituting mass for operational cleverness in his effort to
subdue Ukraine. The West needs to be prepared for this fact, and the
potential that the war will move westward. If Putin chooses this course
of action, bringing the two sides into far closer contact, it will be
important to manage force-on-force friction to keep the conflict limited
and to ensure that it does not spill over into Europe. The United States
and NATO can manage escalatory risks, but it is important to think
clearly about what is at stake, proactively increase transparency with
Moscow about certain NATO actions in Poland, and [explore a clear
deconfliction mechanism](http://www.apple.com/) to manage flights in
certain air corridors. **T[he West has stood remarkably
united]{.underline}** [in the face of Russian aggression, but all
parties involved should be thinking about how to manage spillover from
what may turn out to be a longer and bloodier war than Moscow planned
for.]{.underline}

the Kremlin looks to sow discord and fuel animus toward the organization
amid the Covid-19 pandemic.142 False stories were spread regarding
NATO's intent to withdraw troops from Lithuania, Canadian troops
allegedly exposing Latvia to the virus, and a Polish military official

**NATO checks cyber disinformation now**

**NATO 20** (NATO; 17 Jul. 2020, "NATO's approach to countering
disinformation: a focus on COVID-19,"
<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/177273.htm>)

[NATO has demonstrated that it can sustain its operations, missions and
activities, and maintain readiness]{.underline} despite the pandemic.
The Alliance is now preparing for a possible second wave of COVID-19
with an operation plan, a stockpile of medical supplies and funding,
while also strengthening the resilience of our societies. That is
because international organisations such as NATO, as well as NATO Allies
and partners, have faced a proliferation of disinformation, propaganda
and misinformation during the pandemic. NATO views disinformation as the
deliberate creation and dissemination of false and/or manipulated
information with the intent to deceive and/or mislead. Disinformation
seeks to deepen divisions within and between Allied nations, and to
undermine people's confidence in elected governments. The Alliance has
been dealing with these challenges since its inception and has been
actively countering a significant increase in disinformation and
propaganda since Russia illegally annexed Crimea, Ukraine, in 2014.
[NATO has intensified efforts to counter disinformation, following clear
direction from Allied Heads of State and Government in the 2018 Brussels
Summit Declaration]{.underline}, which stated: "We face hybrid
challenges, including disinformation campaigns and malicious cyber
activities." In 2019, in their London Declaration, Allied Heads of State
and Government said that [NATO is "strengthening \[its\] ability to
prepare for, deter, and defend against hybrid tactics that seek to
undermine our security and societies." NATO is responding in a unified
manner, working in close cooperation with Allies and
partners]{.underline}. NATO acts in a measured and responsible way,
countering disinformation with fact-based, credible public
communications. NATO publicly refutes false claims, debunks the main
disinformation narratives aimed at the Alliance and coordinates to share
information, insight and best practice. NATO also works with the
European Union, the United Nations, the G7 and civil society to counter
disinformation. A free and independent media is the best response to
disinformation and propaganda, with journalists free to ask tough
questions and check their sources. COVID-19 has focused the attention of
many to the ongoing challenge of disinformation, propaganda and
misinformation and the potential harm it can inflict. In a pandemic,
facts and clear communications can save lives. They are essential to
maintain public safety and uphold NATO's shared values of freedom,
democracy and the rule of law. By working together, NATO Allies and
partners are making our societies more resilient and our people safer.
[NATO's approach to countering disinformation involves a twin-track
model, focused on the 'Understand' and 'Engage' functions. The
Understand function encompasses Information Environment Assessments,
which regularly track, monitor and analyse information relevant to
NATO's mission. This enables NATO to evaluate the effectiveness of its
communications. The Engage function embeds these insights, enabling NATO
to tailor its strategic communications where it will most effectively
counter disinformation. NATO's communications are fact-based, timely,
transparent and coordinated.]{.underline} This allows NATO to have an
impact in a contested information space. Coordination with Allies and
partners is the cornerstone of all NATO's work both to understand the
information environment and to engage audiences. This is particularly
important when dealing with a fast-moving crisis such as the COVID-19
pandemic. It is crucial for NATO that nations, other international
organisations, such as the EU, as well as civil society and the private
sector, work together to build resilience in our societies.

#### NATO utilizes a strategy of communication and clarity to counter misinformation now

**NATO Engages** **[NATO's communications are based on real actions and
facts]{.underline}**. NATO and Allied armed forces have played a key
role in supporting civilian efforts to fight COVID-19, with some 350
flights delivering hundreds of tons of critical supplies, the
construction of almost 100 field hospitals, and almost half a million
troops across the Alliance securing borders, transporting patients and
helping with testing. To ensure NATO is prepared for a possible second
wave of COVID-19, Allies have agreed a new plan, a new stockpile of
medical equipment, and a new fund for the quick acquisition of medical
supplies. Many Allies have already offered to donate to the stockpile
and contribute to the fund. This is a **[clear]{.underline}** sign of
**[Alliance unity and solidarity. The practical support provided by NATO
Allies to other Allies, as well as partners, has underpinned NATO's
communications on COVID-19. NATO views fact-based, credible
communications as the best way of countering
disinformation]{.underline}**. This is based on the Alliance's core
values of democracy, freedom of speech and the rule of law. Engaging the
public and building resilience over the medium to long term is the most
effective way to inoculate people against disinformation.
**[[NATO]{.mark} will continue to [expose disinformation through]{.mark}
a wide range of media engagements including [statements, rebuttals and
corrections,]{.mark} and [briefings to inform a wide variety of
audiences about disinformation and propaganda]{.mark}, as it has since

Ongoing COVID-19 related information and news stories can be found at
[www.nato.int/covid19](https://www.nato.int/covid19). To shape the
policy debate**[, NATO has turned public diplomacy face to face events
into online engagements. [Communications]{.mark} in Russian [have been
enhanced]{.mark}. This include [articles]{.mark}, [translations of

[36](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/177273.htm#fn34), and videos on
our Russian language YouTube channel. To reach a broader audience, [NATO
routinely translates content into a range of languages]{.mark}. NATO
supports the work of independent NGOs, think tanks, academics,
fact-checking organisations and other civil society initiatives to
promote debate and to build resilience]{.underline}**. A pluralistic,
independent media sector also plays an important role in countering
disinformation and conveying factual information to the public. NATO
engages with media to provide timely information on its response to
COVID-19 to a potential audience of hundreds of millions of people[.
**[NATO has conducted briefings to media in multiple
countries]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, including Georgia, Moldova, Russia

**[Coordination with partners and international institutions underpins
both the Understand and Engage strands of NATO's response to

with a rapidly evolving crisis such as COVID-19. To identify, analyse
and counter disinformation, NATO works with the European Union through
the European External Action Service
[^37^](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/177273.htm#fn35) and the
European Commission, the G7 Rapid Response Mechanism, the United Nations

#### The Rapid Alert System is currently in effect, progress reports are promising

**Rankovic, '19** (Didi Rankovic is an experienced online journalist,
editor, and translator, with a career spanning over ten years writing
for major a English-language website in Serbia, and previously working
as translator for international organizations and peacekeepers in the
Balkans. Rankovic is passionate about free and open source tech and is a

https://reclaimthenet.org/the-eus-rapid-alert-system-fake-news/)

The European Union (EU) is scrambling to establish tighter control of
online information ahead of the elections in May for the European
Parliament (EP). This effort requires cooperation from Big Tech and
advertisers -- who must keep "fake news" at bay, or risk EU regulation
-- and cooperation with partners such as NATO and G7. [**[The Rapid
Alert System,
[announced](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-18-6648_en.htm)
late last year, whose declared goal is to allow EU member-states to
"share information on ongoing foreign disinformation campaigns with one
another, and coordinate responses]{.underline}**," **[has now come into
effect]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** Specifically, the
foreign information threat the EU is looking to shield itself from is
Russia, and "pro-Kremlin" disinformation. After the 2016 US presidential
elections, Hillary Clinton's campaign and supporters never accepted her
defeat as the choice of American voters -- but rather the result of
American voters being manipulated by Russia. Russia continues to deny
these accusations, but ever since the big US election upset that saw
Donald Trump become president, there have been attempts, to various
degrees successful, to pin the outcome of every election and referendum
in the western world that didn't quite go the establishment's way on
Russia's malign influence. This includes Brexit, the UK's vote to leave
the EU. Addressing the European Data Protection and Privacy Conference,
EU Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society Mariya Gabriel has now
offered some
[[insight]{.underline}](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-19-1789_en.htm)
into the way the new system is set up and meant to function. Gabriel
mentioned **[that [US tech and social media giants]{.mark} and
advertisers have [signed up to the [Code of
Practice](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/code-practice-disinformation)]{.mark}.
Under the code, these companies are expected to cut off revenue streams
to suspected offenders, remove their accounts, promote news from sources
viewed favorably, and ensure more transparency when it comes to
political advertising. "In view of the European Parliament elections,
Google and Facebook are providing training to candidates, political
parties and campaigners on how to manage their online presence and on
how to protect their campaigns,"]{.underline}** Gabriel revealed during
her keynote speech. But that's not all -- **[since late 2018, Twitter,
Facebook, and Google [have been reporting]{.mark} to the EU on a
[monthly]{.mark} basis on the [progress]{.mark} they [made in
implementing]{.mark} this]{.underline}** voluntary, and self-regulatory,
**[code]{.underline}**. The **[[last]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[such
"progress [report" showed promise]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the EU
official said -- but warned that "we are not yet there." And while these
companies have all implemented "a tool to monitor political ads" -- not
everyone is moving fast enough to remove unwanted accounts. YouTube, for
example, reported removing 600,000 in February alone -- but the
commissioner admitted the EU is not sure if their offense was of
political or commercial nature. Facebook is yet to report its latest
figures -- while Twitter reported "nothing" -- said Gabriel. **[The
European Commission has also enlisted help from "independent
[fact-checkers](https://reclaimthenet.org/newsguards-trusted-sources-fake-news/)
and researchers to detect and expose disinformation campaigns across
social networks,"]{.underline}** Gabriel said. On the member-states'
side, "election cooperation networks" have been put in place to swiftly
detect "potential threats," she explained. In the context of the
initiative, the commissioner made special emphasis on data protection
and privacy, linking the issue with political disinformation campaigns.
Advertisers, ISPs, insurers and others collecting and misusing personal
data in order to sell "shoes and cars" is one thing -- but what if the
same techniques are used by (bad) governments and those with vested
political interest? Gabriel differentiated between "legitimate"
political processing of online users' data, and that which brings with
it "serious risks" to privacy and trust in the democratic process.
According to Gabriel, EU citizens are given protection in both scenarios
by the GDPR and the e-Privacy Regulation. The GDPR stands for "General
Data Protection Regulation" -- a piece of legislation in place since
2018 that is seen as having good intent to give users more protection
and control over their own data, but has also [[found its critics in
being difficult to
implement]{.underline}](https://reclaimthenet.org/google-gdpr-fine/).
However, Gabriel praised it as having become a global standard in just
under a year, and spoke strongly in favor of a "transparent, fair and
lawful" manner of data collection and processing. It's hard to assess
how effective the EU's move to introduce these measures can and will be,
but it seems unlikely to backfire as a political initiative. If the EP
elections produce a status-quo, the EU could blame Russia for trying,
while giving itself a pat on the back for a job well done in blocking
Moscow's interference. In the reverse scenario, the EU could blame
Russia for succeeding -- and push for even more regulation, more
self-regulation from tech companies, and more money paid by EU
member-states towards the budget of the European External Action Service
(EEAS) -- the implementer of the Rapid Alert System.

#### The aff can't solve - AI solutions cannot quickly identify disinformation attacks

Innovation at Brookings. He is also a professor of electrical
engineering, law, public policy, and management at UCLA, as well as
co-director of the UCLA Institute for Technology, Law, and Policy.
Villasenor's work considers the technology, policy, and legal issues
arising from key technology trends including the growth of artificial

networks and systems, and continued advances in computing and
communications., "How to deal with AI-enabled disinformation,"
<https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-to-deal-with-ai-enabled-disinformation/>)

One hurdle to any learning algorithm, whether supervised or
unsupervised, is access to a sufficiently large set of training data.
Information suitable for use as training data regarding a particular
issue or question can take significant time to accumulate on social
media. [To be useful in AI systems for detecting disinformation, the
data would in many (though not all) instances require at least some
degree of manual coding at the outset.]{.underline} Such an approach
works if the topic at issue is one---such as false claims regarding
medical cures---for which the time over which it is important to
continue to combat the disinformation is much longer than the time it
would take to build and use a large set of training data. But it is far
less effective for situations when disinformation defenses need to be
deployed very quickly, and in which there will typically be a smaller
amount of data that can be used as a basis for the algorithm to learn.
[Another issue, both in rapid and in less time-constrained attempts to
identify disinformation, is the accuracy of the data labels on which an
AI algorithm is relying during the learning process. "Noisy" data---data
in which the labels are not necessarily accurate---is a well-known
problem in machine learning.]{.underline} To take a simple example
unrelated to disinformation attacks, consider a machine learning
algorithm that is attempting to learn to automatically distinguish
images of cars from images of bicycles. To do this, the algorithm might
scour the internet and find millions of images that are labeled "car"
and millions of other images labeled "bicycle." In most cases, those
labels will be correct. But in some instances, the labels will be
incorrect; an image labeled "car" might show a truck, a bicycle, or
content completely unrelated to vehicles. [The higher the fraction of
incorrect labels, the more difficult and slower it will be for the
algorithm to learn to accurately distinguish between cars and
bicycles.]{.underline} Working with noisy data is an active area of
research, and there are emerging approaches that can help
mitigate---though not completely eliminate---the loss in accuracy that
results when a machine learning algorithm learns based data in which
there a is substantive fraction of labeling inaccuracies.\[8\] Attempts
to use AI to identify disinformation will likely need to confront noisy
data for the simple reason that intentional deception is involved. Most
people who post an image of a car to the internet wouldn't choose to
label it "bicycle" just to throw off machine learning algorithms. But
disinformation attacks will be associated with a set of conflicting
claims about whether online statements are true. Returning to the
Election Day example from above, in response to a tweet falsely stating
that a polling location is closed, someone who has actually just voted
at that location might reply with a tweet stating that the initial tweet
is false and that the polling location was in fact open. That reply is,
in effect, a label. An account controlled by the attackers might also
reply to the initial tweet by asserting that it is true. That reply is
also a label, though one that directly contradicts the reply from the
real voter. Over short time scales, it would be exceedingly difficult
for an algorithm---or a human---to know which label to trust. Responding
quickly to disinformation thus requires addressing the twin hurdles of
limited data and unreliable---and in some cases, intentionally
wrong---labels of that data. Responding quickly to disinformation thus
requires addressing the twin hurdles of limited data and
unreliable---and in some cases, intentionally wrong---labels of that
data." Researchers have recognized these issues and are developing new
approaches that do not rely on a large set of pre-existing training
data. In April 2020, a team of researchers from Microsoft and Arizona
State University posted a pre-publication version of a paper\[9\]
describing new results on techniques for quickly detecting fake
news.\[10\] In the paper the authors note that traditional approaches to
detecting fake news "rely on large amounts of labeled instances to train
supervised models. Such large labeled training data is difficult to
obtain in the early phase of fake news detection."\[11\] To address
this, the authors introduce a method that requires only a "small amount
of manually-annotated clean data,"\[12\] which can be used to rapidly
and automatically label a larger set of data based on posts and comments
on news articles by social media users. User credibility is one of the
factors considered in forming the labels. According to the authors, this
approach "outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for early detection of
fake news."\[13\] Frameworks like this can not only help solve the
problem of limited data, but could potentially also help mitigate
labeling accuracy issues. As the above examples help to convey, one
common theme in research addressing disinformation is the importance of
measuring the credibility of online sources. Approaches to establish and
then leverage credibility will be critical to quickly identifying truth
in the presence of a well-constructed rapid disinformation attack. For
instance, in the Election Day scenario, it would be advantageous to give
high credibility weight to the social media accounts of local television
and news stations and the reporters who work at those stations. That
way, as soon as those stations are able to identify that the claims of
closed polling places are false and disseminate that fact on social
media, the AI system can calibrate truth and falsity and move to the
next step of addressing the posts known to contain disinformation.\[14\]
It is also important to recognize the limits of what AI can be expected
to accomplish. Earlier this year, Samuel Woolley of UT Austin published
an excerpt of his book "The Reality Game" in MIT Technology Review. In
it, Woolley noted that "There simply is no easy fix to the problem of
computational propaganda on social media."\[15\] [**It would be**
**unreasonable to expect any AI solution that will be available in the
near future would be able to quickly and unambiguously identify a rapid
disinformation attack.** However, AI will certainly be able to provide
insight into the dynamics of emerging disinformation attacks, pinpoint
at least some of the social media accounts at the source, and compute
confidence levels regarding the likely truth or falsity of a claim
making the rounds on social media.]{.underline} After that, the response
will need to be overseen by humans making decisions based on a
combination of the AI outputs and guidance from policy frameworks.

### 2nc -- AI can't solve

#### AI systems fail to accurately identify disinformation attacks -- conflicting algorithm labels are too complicated 

**Wooley 20** (Samuel Wooley; January 8, 2020; an assistant professor at
Moody School of Communication at the University of Texas-Austin, "We're
fighting fake news AI bots by using more AI. That's a mistake,"
<https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/01/08/130983/were-fighting-fake-news-ai-bots-by-using-more-ai-thats-a-mistake/>)

When I was at the Oxford Internet Institute, meanwhile, we looked into
how and whether Twitter bots were used during the Brexit debate. We
found that while many were used to spread messages about the Leave
campaign, the vast majority of the automated accounts were very simple.
They were made to alter online conversation with bots that had been
built simply to boost likes and follows, to spread links, to game
trends, or to troll opposition. It was gamed by small groups of human
users who understood the magic of memes and virality, of seeding
conspiracies online and watching them grow. Conversations were blocked
by basic bot-generated spam and noise, purposefully attached to
particular hashtags in order to demobilize online conversations. Links
to news articles that showed a politician in a particular light were
hyped by fake or proxy accounts made to post and repost the same junk
over and over and over. These campaigns were wielded quite bluntly:
these bots were not designed to be functionally conversational. They did
not harness AI. There will also need to be policies for handling
situations in which an AI system makes exactly the wrong decision.
[Because of the limited data available in the early stages of a rapid
disinformation attack, the need to quickly make a determination might
**lead an algorithm to invert truth and falsity and conclude that the
disinformation is accurat**e and that the attempts to debunk it are
themselves a disinformation attack.]{.underline} This is a less
far-fetched outcome than it might initially appear to be. Algorithms,
like the people who design them, can be influenced by a confirmation
bias effect, leading to a boost in confidence in a wrong conclusion by
selectively giving greater weight to inputs bolstering that conclusion.
Particularly given the short time scales of rapid disinformation
attacks, this could lead an algorithm to quickly converge on an
incorrect conclusion that would need human intervention to identify and
invert. For most topics and events, there simply won't be the resources
to supply staffing dedicated to individually monitoring each of the
essentially limitless list of situations in which disinformation might
arise. Attempts to use AI to identify disinformation will likely need to
confront noisy data for the simple reason that intentional deception is
involved. Most people who post an image of a car to the internet
wouldn't choose to label it "bicycle" just to throw off machine learning
algorithms. [But **disinformation attacks will be associated with a set
of conflicting claims** about whether online statements are
true.]{.underline} Returning to the Election Day example from above, in
response to a tweet falsely stating that a polling location is closed,
someone who has actually just voted at that location might reply with a
tweet stating that the initial tweet is false and that the polling
location was in fact open. That reply is, in effect, a label. An account
controlled by the attackers might also reply to the initial tweet by
asserting that it is true. That reply is also a label, though one that
directly contradicts the reply from the real voter. Over short time
scales, [it would be **exceedingly difficult for an
algorithm**]{.underline}---or a human---[**to know which label to
trust**. R**esponding quickly to disinformation thus requires addressing
the twin hurdles of limited data and unreliable**---and in some cases,
intentionally wrong---**labels of that data**.]{.underline} This is
especially true given that companies such as Facebook and Twitter
operate globally; there are literally billions of accounts in nearly two
hundred countries that could potentially be employed to disseminate
disinformation. As a result, for the vast majority of instances of
disinformation, human intervention at the social media companies will of
necessity occur only after a problem is flagged either algorithmically
or through manual reporting channels. Public policy will play a central
role in both the human and technological aspects of the response to
rapid disinformation attacks. At the technology level, policies will
need to be embedded into the algorithms in relation to questions such
as: What confidence level that a rapid disinformation attack is
occurring should trigger notification to human managers that an activity
of concern has been identified? Over what time scales should the AI
system make that evaluation, and should that time scale depend on the
nature and/or extent of the disinformation? For example, suspected
disinformation regarding violence should clearly receive a higher
priority for immediate resolution than disinformation associated with
conflicting online characterizations of what a politician said at a
recent campaign speech. Other questions that can drive policies to be
embedded in AI disinformation detection systems include: Under what
circumstances should an AI system preemptively shut down accounts
suspected of originating a rapid disinformation attack? What types of
autonomous actions, if any, should be taken to address posts from
legitimate accounts that unwittingly contribute to propagating
disinformation? Policy considerations will be an important driver for
the human response as well. When an AI system identifies a potential
rapid disinformation attack, managers at social media companies will
need a set of guidelines for how to proceed. Policies can also guide the
extent to which people at social media companies should arrange in
advance to be "on call" to watch for rapid disinformation attacks. It is
clear that for a short duration, high stakes events like a national
election, [social media companies will need to have people standing by
ready to step in and address disinformation.]{.underline} For events in
that category, the question is not whether disinformation will be
present, but rather how much of it there will be, and how sophisticated
the attacks will be.

breaking news for The Hill where she focused on a variety of

[The Federal Trade Commission issued a warn**ing regarding the
government's use of artificial intelligence technology to fight
disinformation,** deepfakes, crime and other online concerns, citing the
technology's inherent limitations with bias and
discrimination.]{.underline}Detailed in a report sent to Congress,
officials at the FTC said that [**AI technology cannot play a neutral
role** in mitigating social problems online]{.underline}, specifically
noting that using it in this capacity could give way to illegal data
extraction from online users and conduct improper surveillance. "Our
report emphasizes that nobody should treat AI as the solution to the
spread of harmful online content," said Director of the FTC's Bureau of
Consumer Protection Samuel Levine. "Combatting online harm requires a
broad societal effort, not an overly optimistic belief that new
technology---which can be both helpful and dangerous---will take these
problems off our hands."The report specifically highlights the broadly
rudimentary level this technology is at, mainly with the datasets AI
algorithms run on not being representative enough to successfully
identify harmful content. AI software developers' biases are also likely
to influence the technology's decision-making, a longstanding issue
within the AI industry. [FTC authors also added that most **AI programs
cannot gauge context**, further rendering it unreliable in
distinguishing harmful content.]{.underline} "The key conclusion of this
report is thus that governments, platforms and others must exercise
great caution in either mandating the use of, or over-relying on, these
tools even for the important purpose of reducing harms," the report
reads. "Although outside of our scope, this conclusion implies that, if
AI is not the answer and if the scale makes meaningful human oversight
infeasible, we must look at other ways, regulatory or otherwise, to
address the spread of these harms. [Another critical observation the FTC
arrived at is that **human intervention is still needed** to regulate
the AI features that may inadvertently target and censor the wrong
content]{.underline}. Transparency surrounding how the technology is
built, mainly within its algorithmic development, is also highly
recommended. The report also noted that platforms and websites which
host the circulation of harmful content should work to slow the spread
of illegal topics or misinformation on their end. [The FTC recommends
instilling tools]{.underline} like downvoting, labeling or other
targeting operations [that aren't necessarily AI-run
censorship]{.underline}. "Dealing effectively with online harms requires
substantial changes in business models and practices, along with
cultural shifts in how people use or abuse online services," the report
concluded. "These changes involve significant time and effort across
society and can include, among other things, technological innovation,
transparent and accountable use of that technology, meaningful human
oversight, global collaboration, digital literacy and appropriate
regulation. AI is no magical shortcut." [The report stems from a 2021
law that asked the FTC to review how AI might be used to fight
disinformation and digital crime. FTC Commissioners voted to send the
report to Congress upon finalization in a 4-1 decision.]{.underline}

## Sweden/Finland Turn

### 1nc - turn

#### Russia is pushing disinformation campaigns in Finland and Sweden -- prevents them from joining NATO

**Dragonfly 22,** (Dragonfly\'s Security Intelligence & Analysis
Service, 12 Apr 2022 "Finland / Sweden \| Russian disinformation and
cyber campaigns very likely",
<https://www.dragonflyintelligence.com/news/finland-sweden-russian-disinformation-and-cyber-campaigns-very-likely/>)

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine seems to have prompted a near total shift
in their foreign policies; we now assess that both are likely to apply
to join NATO in the coming months]{.underline}. Disinformation campaigns
in particular would fit with what is a tried-and-tested but rarely
successful approach by Russia to divide society and polarise debates
over contentious issues that threaten its national security. To reflect
this, we have raised our cyber threat [exposure levels for Finland and
Sweden from high to severe. This does not mean that we anticipate the
likelihood of a disruptive cyber incident on critical infrastructure in
either country is elevated at present.]{.underline} But that in our
assessment, the three indicators below are likely to increasingly play
out in the coming months: Finland and Sweden have a high degree of
diplomatic or military tensions with another country that has advanced
offensive cyber capabilities (Russia). The Finnish and Swedish
authorities have warned of the potential for offensive cyber and
information operations in the coming months. There are early signs that
Russia is engaged in active disinformation campaigns in Finland and
Sweden. Accelerated accession plans [Russia has repeatedly warned
Finland and Sweden against joining NATO, threatening retaliation if they
do. Russia already seems to be engaging in hostile activity against
Finland.]{.underline} The Finnish government said that while the
Ukrainian president was giving an online speech to its MPs on 8 April,
DDoS attacks forced several government websites and services offline.
The Finnish authorities have not attributed this to Russia or the groups
it co-opts, but it did say that a Russian state aircraft was 'suspected'
to have breached its airspace at the same time. The [Russian invasion of
Ukraine has incentivised Finland and Sweden to pursue NATO
membership.]{.underline} Finland tabled a white paper on its 'security
environment' in parliament yesterday, 13 April. And more than half of
MPs would support a proposal to join NATO, according to local press
reports. The Finnish prime minister yesterday said that a decision would
be made 'in weeks'. And the former prime minister has said the
government could apply to NATO in May, ahead of the bloc's summit in
Madrid on 29-30 June. More surprising has been Sweden's openness to NATO
accession. According to sources in the governing party cited in the
usually-reliable Svenska Dagbladet this week, the Swedish government
plans to submit an application to join NATO in June, and accession
appears to now have cross-party support. The Swedish prime minister had
said on 8 March that a NATO bid 'would further destabilise the security
of this particular region of Europe'. While it is not clear what has
prompted this apparent turn-around, the invasion of Ukraine has probably
made Finland and Sweden now see being inside NATO as safer than outside
of it. Divisive campaigns As part of attempts to influence and polarise
debates on NATO accession, [**Russia is very likely to push
disinformation campaigns and divisive messaging in Finland and Sweden in
the coming months**. The Swedish security police said last month that
Russia's goal is to keep it out of NATO, and that it tries to 'influence
decisions...and behaviours...in Sweden through misleading
information']{.underline}. Supo, the Finnish intelligence service, has
assessed that Russian disinformation tactics could include the
following: Claims of abuse or harassment of people with a 'Russian
background' in Finland Blackmail of politicians Deep fake videos of
'real people' All of the above are tried-and-tested tactics by Russia,
particularly in the Baltics. And there is clear precedent of Russia
pursuing disinformation tactics in Finland and Sweden related to NATO.
The Swedish Institute of International Affairs in 2017 said that the
circulation of fake news, false documents and disinformation by Russia
around that time was intended to influence public opinion and decision
making in Sweden and to hinder the Swedish government's ability to gain
public support for its policies. The institute added that Russia's goal
was to 'preserve the geo-strategic status quo' by minimising NATO's role
in the Baltics and keeping Sweden out of the alliance. [**Pro-Russia
media outlets and social media** bots are highly likely to be the **main
source of divisive messaging and disinformation** in Finland and Sweden
in the coming months. Based on Russia's past disinformation campaigns,
**probable narratives include the killing or raping of civilians by NATO
member-state troops, corruption within the alliance and that NATO
expansion is a threat to Russia**.]{.underline} For the Kremlin, it
seemingly views disinformation campaigns as a way to exacerbate societal
divisions and destabilise its adversaries. Such campaigns are likely to
be evident ahead of a general election in Sweden in September.
Disinformation campaigns by Russia are unlikely to destabilise Finland
or Sweden, such as by prompting unrest due to divisive messaging, let
alone derail any NATO accession. Alleged Russian disinformation
campaigns in the Baltics for example have failed at distorting public
opinion on issues such as Russian language rights. And Russia seems to
be losing the battle to reverse public support for NATO membership in
Finland and Sweden; opinion polls cited in the press have suggested that
68% of Finns now support NATO membership, more than double the
proportion prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Cyber campaigns
[Despite increasing Russian hostility towards Finland and Sweden, we
doubt that Russian state-sponsored cyber groups are currently intent on
disrupting critical systems in either country. Instead, **they are
likely to increase the scale of cyber activity in Finland and Sweden for
intelligence collection**, particularly around NATO accession, and
launch technically unsophisticated attacks such as barrages of
DDoS]{.underline} (as occurred on 8 April). The Finnish authorities have
said Russia is 'likely' to expand its cyber and information 'from
Ukraine to the West' and increase such operations against Finland in the
coming months. There is a reasonable chance that hacktivist and criminal
cyber groups supporting Russia will increasingly seek to target
businesses in Finland and Sweden in the coming months. Several prominent
malware and ransomware groups have intensified their attacks, mainly on
Ukrainian networks, since the invasion of the country on 24 February.
And while we have not seen such groups explicitly threaten Finnish or
Swedish firms, some have expressed outright hostility towards the West.
The potentially-high financial rewards for targeting firms in Finland
and Sweden probably make them attractive for cyber extortion groups.

Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Wednesday. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy
chairman of Russia\'s Security Council, said that should Sweden and
Finland join NATO then Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval
and air forces in the Baltic Sea. Medvedev also explicitly raised the
nuclear threat by saying that there could be no more talk of a \"nuclear
free\" Baltic - where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave sandwiched
between Poland and Lithuania. \"There can be no more talk of any
nuclear--free status for the Baltic - the balance must be restored,\"
said Medvedev, who was Russian president from 2008 to 2012. [Medvedev

#### Hypersonic missiles trigger arms race

**Schwartz 21,** (Mattathias Schwartz, senior correspondent at Insider,
6 Dec 2021 "Hypersonic missiles could start World War III --- but that's
not the biggest threat they pose",
https://www.businessinsider.com/china-and-russia-have-deployed-hypersonic-missiles-2021-12)

It\'s April 2023. China is massing troops at the Taiwan Strait. Party
leaders claim they\'re conducting a peaceful military exercise. But the
National Security Agency has intercepted phone calls and texts from
President Xi Jinping\'s inner circle that indicate an invasion is
imminent. As a show of US resolve, President Joe Biden orders the USS
Ronald Reagan, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier based in Japan, to a
position just off Taiwan. It\'s a tense standoff. But neither Biden nor
Xi wants a war. The two leaders schedule a virtual summit, in the hope
that they can negotiate a peaceful resolution. Then, an hour before
their call, Donald Trump --- who\'s been named speaker of the House by
the newly elected GOP majority --- logs on to \@SpeakerTrump and tweets:
\"I hereby declare WAR on China under Article One of the Constitution!
Sorry, Xi! This is what happens when you don\'t return calls from
America\'s REAL PRESIDENT. You have 24 hours to PERSONALLY guarantee
Taiwan\'s freedom. -DJT\" Almost immediately, Beijing\'s secure phone
lines light up with reassurances from officials at the White House.
Trump\'s declaration, they say, is nothing but political grandstanding.
But Xi decides to treat the insult as an act of war. Two hours after
Trump\'s tweet, the predawn sky above the Strait is broken open by a
flash, followed by a series of sonic booms. In a fraction of a second,
20 dart-shaped projectiles rip through the Reagan\'s armored steel skin,
traveling at upward of 5,000 mph. What\'s left of the carrier becomes a
smoking inferno, flecked with radioactive chunks of uranium from the
carrier\'s nuclear reactor. The impact destroys its complement of 90
fixed-wing jets and kills most of the 6,000 troops on board. What is
this mysterious superweapon that just touched off World War III? In this
imaginary scenario, the Reagan was sunk by a very real weapon: [the
DF-ZF, a hypersonic missile that can travel five times the speed of
sound, striking targets from a distance of 3,400 miles. After being
launched high into the atmosphere via a medium- or long-range ballistic
rocket, the DF-ZF\'s arrowhead-shaped \"glide vehicle\" maneuvers on its
own through the air before nosediving onto its target. You don\'t have
to wait until 2023 to see the DF-ZF in the field. China has already
included it in military parades and deployed it with active-duty
units.]{.underline} While [ballistic missiles travel in soaring,
predictable parabolic arcs, like punted footballs, hypersonic missiles
are more like speedy hockey pucks that keep low and change direction in
an instant. The high velocity means more damage; the maneuverability and
lower altitude make them harder to track and intercept. But for the
Pentagon, the scariest thing about hypersonic weapons is that China and
Russia have already deployed them in the field, while the United States
is still developing them.]{.underline} Over the summer the Financial
Times, citing anonymous Pentagon insiders, reported that China had fired
a ballistic missile that released a hypersonic missile, which in turn
jettisoned another projectile, possibly designed to foil a
missile-defense system. In the grim humor of the arms-control world,
this mysterious threefold weapon was dubbed the \"turducken\" missile.
Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, likened the
Chinese test to a \"Sputnik moment\" --- a shocking public display of
just how far America has fallen behind. There are reasons to be
skeptical of Milley\'s assessment. Almost everything we know about
hypersonic missiles comes to us from the nationalistic leaders of China
and Russia, who like to exaggerate their strength for propaganda
purposes, or the Pentagon, which has a long track record of exaggerating
outside threats while seeking to bolster its funding. In an age when the
US military is attempting to transition from the global war on terror to
so-called great-power competition with China and Russia, hypersonics has
become an appropriations buzzword. The Pentagon asked for \$3.8 billion
for its hypersonics programs in 2022, up from \$2.6 billion in 2020. The
military has a growing hypersonics bureaucracy that includes a
hypersonics \"war room,\" the Joint Hypersonics Transition Office, and a
principal director for hypersonics. \"The pursuit of a new technology
can be as much about its marketability to congressional appropriators as
it is about capabilities,\" says Cameron Tracy, a Stanford-affiliated
scholar who has questioned the military benefit of hypersonics. \"If
you\'re the Department of Defense, your choice is between talking about
a 50-year-old ballistic missile versus a hypersonic missile, where no
one is really sure what it can do, and it sounds really cool. In that
situation, you are incentivized to make it look as though we\'re
behind.\" Resurrecting the logic of the Cold War For a while, the United
States led the world in hypersonic-missile development. In 2003, George
W. Bush asked the Pentagon to come up with a \"Conventional Prompt
Global Strike\" --- the ability to strike any target, anywhere, within
minutes, even in places like Afghanistan that were far from US bases and
nuclear submarines. By 2009, after a few years of research and testing,
the Defense Science Board, which advises the Pentagon, came up with five
\"representative scenarios\" for situations in which a hypersonic weapon
might be used. Three involved terrorists or a \"rogue state,\" like
North Korea. Only one --- an attempt to take out a US satellite ---
involved conflict with Russia or China. After that, funding for
hypersonics dried up. The technology seemed to be a solution in search
of a problem. There were certainly times when the US needed to hit
distant targets fast, but old-fashioned subsonic Tomahawk missiles, or
teams of Navy SEALs, could do the job just fine. But as China and Russia
began making headway on their own programs, the rationale behind US
hypersonics shifted. Before, hypersonic weapons were being developed for
a specific mission. Now, the military argued, we needed them solely for
the sake of keeping up with China and Russia. Michael Griffin, then the
undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, proclaimed that
it was \"among my very highest priorities\" to develop hypersonic
missiles to \"hold China and Russia at risk in a corresponding manner.\"
Griffin was dusting off the circular logic of the Cold War: We had to
win the arms race because there was an arms race. China has been
parading its new hypersonic weapons, including these DF-17 ballistic
rockets that are equipped to deploy DF-ZF missiles at five times the
speed of sound. It\'s worth remembering that [during the Cold War, the
Pentagon consistently overestimated the strength of Soviet forces, first
with the bomber gap and then with the missile gap. In both cases, the US
military got spooked by fragmentary intelligence and successful tests
like Sputnik and succeeded in convincing itself that it was falling
behind.]{.underline} In 1959, for instance, military sources warned
respected Washington reporters that the Soviet Union was on the verge of
having 100 intercontinental nuclear missiles, versus 30 in the American
arsenal. In fact, by the end of 1960, the Soviets had deployed only two
long-range nukes. The military\'s claims that it was losing the arms
race were really justifications for accelerating it. Military insiders
insist that this time, the threat is real. \"In my previous job, I was
cleared into everything,\" Mark J. Lewis, who oversaw DARPA as the
Pentagon\'s acting deputy undersecretary for research and engineering,
told me. \"I can tell you definitively that the Chinese really are
ahead.\" (Lewis now works at the National Defense Industrial
Association, a non-profit trade group that represents military
contractors.) China is said to have the capacity to hitch a hypersonic
missile to a medium-range DF-17 ballistic rocket or a long-range DF-41,
with or without a nuclear warhead. Russia has the long-range Avangard,
another ballistic missile with a glide vehicle attached, and two
hypersonic cruise missiles: the ship-launched Zircon (still under
development) and the air-launched Kinzhal (already in the field). The
most important question is: So what? [Does it really matter whether
China and Russia have hypersonic missiles that we don\'t? The United
States still rules the world in the two military technologies that
matter most: nuclear weapons and airpower. You might have heard, for
instance, that China is seeking to triple its nuclear arsenal, to 1,000
warheads, by the end of this decade. It sounds scary --- until you
consider that the US already has nearly 4,000 warheads. In 2022, the
United States plans to devote \$768 billion to military spending. China
is expected to spend less than half that amount; Russia less than a
tenth. It\'s true that a hypersonic missile could take out an aircraft
carrier, which poses a serious tactical problem. But that vulnerability
alone does little to alter America\'s vast military superiority. The
United States trembling at the prospect of a few hypersonic missiles is
a bit like a teenage bully whining about a kindergartener with a
spitball.]{.underline} More game adjuster than game changer The question
of whether hypersonic technology poses some kind of new and disruptive
threat hinges on the doctrine of mutually assured destruction --- the
idea that no country will ever use its stockpile of nuclear weapons
because every country is unwilling to suffer the nuclear consequences.
The doctrine has worked, so far, because no great power has the ability
to knock out its rivals\' nuclear arsenals fast enough to prevent them
from being deployed. And while the US leads the world in missile
defense, it\'s still a long way from being able to stop a massive
nuclear attack by Russia or China, which further reduces the likelihood
that anyone will ever use such weapons. Ironically, the US lead in
missile defense is one reason that China and Russia have bet so heavily
on long-range hypersonic missiles, which have the ability to carry a
nuclear warhead. If the US defense system ever reaches the point at
which it can stop every ballistic nuke, hypersonic missiles could offer
an alternative. \"They want a hedge,\" explains Tracy, the critic of
hypersonics. But there is one crucial difference between the two
technologies. Nuclear bombs were immediately recognized as a revolution
in warfare. The significance of hypersonic weapons, by contrast, is
still hotly debated. Skeptics argue that they don\'t accomplish much
that isn\'t already possible using other weapons. Low-altitude ballistic
missiles launched from submarines can deliver speed; MaRV-equipped
missiles can deliver maneuverability. Tracy, along with David Wright of
MIT, argue that hypersonic weapons will underperform their ballistic
peers because of their lower trajectories, which create more friction
with the atmosphere and heats up the missiles. Their findings have been
contested by hypersonics boosters, who have access to the results of
classified tests being conducted in 26 hypersonic wind tunnels scattered
across the US. But whoever is right, the mere existence of a debate over
the efficacy of hypersonic weapons suggests that comparisons to Sputnik
and the Manhattan Project are a stretch. There is one area, at least,
where hypersonic weapons could live up to their billing as a true
revolution in warfare. [For smaller, regional powers that can\'t match
Russia or China\'s advantage in long-range ballistic missiles,
hypersonic weapons offer a relatively inexpensive on-ramp to war. India,
France, and Japan have active hypersonics programs; Israel, South Korea,
and Iran are said to have done basic research. Because there hasn\'t
been much of a rush to curb the development of hypersonics through
treaties and nonproliferation agreements, and because smaller countries
lack the kind of special hotlines and de-escalation protocols that
Russia and the US developed during decades of Cold War brinkmanship,
it\'s not hard to imagine how the new technology could accelerate and
intensify local conflicts.]{.underline} After all, our most recent brush
with nuclear war didn\'t involve the US, China, or Russia. It was a
fight between India and Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir,
in 1999. As the conflict escalated, Pakistan was said to be preparing to
deploy nuclear weapons --- until American intelligence found out and
confronted it within hours of the discovery. But as hypersonic know-how
continues to spread, through science and espionage, the window for
breaking up a fight could get much shorter. In early December, India
announced its first successful test-fire of the hypersonic BrahMos II
cruise missile, which travels almost three times as fast as its
supersonic predecessor. That means Pakistan would have less than 10
minutes to decide whether an incoming BrahMos II was carrying a nuclear
warhead and, if so, how to respond. It may not matter so much if the US
is \"behind\" [in the race to develop a flashy but redundant class of
weaponry. But the spread of hair-trigger missiles --- conventional
weapons that are unregulated by nuclear-arms treaties --- is something
worth worrying about.]{.underline}

[Russia says a **nuclear-free Baltic region would no longer be possible

additional nuclear deployments in Europe. "If Sweden and Finland join
NATO, the length of the alliance's land borders with the Russian

of Russia's Security Council, wrote on his official Telegram channel

he said. Finland's position on NATO is a direct result of Ukraine war,
says NATO chief The comments come a day after Finland and Sweden said
their decision on whether to apply for NATO membership would come within
a matter of weeks. The countries' leaders said their security
assessments had dramatically changed following Russia's invasion of
Ukraine in February. The Baltics --- the northeastern European countries
of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia --- are members of the EU and NATO.
[**Sweden and Finland are members of the EU, but not NATO, and the
latter shares an 830-mile border with Russia. If Finland and Sweden did
join NATO, this would give Moscow "more officially registered
opponents,"** Medvedev added. He claimed that NATO was planning to admit
the two Nordic states with "minimal bureaucratic procedures." Russia's
response should be taken with "no emotion, with a cold head," he added.
Moscow sees neighboring Finland's potential inclusion in NATO as a
threat to its national security,]{.underline} as the U.S. could deploy
advanced military equipment in Finland if it joined the alliance.
'Nothing new' Lithuania, which borders the Russian exclave of
Kaliningrad, brushed off Medvedev's comments on Thursday. It's "nothing
new," Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said. The country's
defense minister, Arvydas Anusauskas, added that Russia already has
nuclear weapons in the Baltic region. How NATO is defending Eastern
Europe "The current Russian threats look quite strange, when we know
that, even without the present security situation, they keep the weapon
100 km from Lithuania's border," Anusauskas was quoted by Lithuania's
BNS wire as saying. "Nuclear weapons have always been kept in
Kaliningrad \... the international community, the countries in the
region, are perfectly aware of this. \... They use it as a threat," he
added. Kaliningrad, which is slightly larger than Connecticut, borders
the Baltic Sea on its west and is sandwiched between NATO members Poland
and Lithuania. [Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has triggered a U-turn in
Finnish public opinion on becoming a member of the 30-country military
alliance, which it has refrained from joining since World War II in a
bid to maintain neutrality. Moscow has in the past warned of severe
consequences and instability in the Nordics if Finland were to join. If
Finland joined the alliance, Sweden would likely follow suit. Finland
and Sweden, as well as Ukraine, are already "Enhanced Opportunity
Partners" of NATO]{.underline}, the closest form of partnership with the
alliance, and partake in military exercises with NATO states. Rather
than urging the countries to pursue membership, NATO Secretary-General
Jens Stoltenberg has repeatedly said it is for Finland and Sweden to
decide their own path. He has also said, "the door remains open" for the
alliance to welcome new members. UK commander on NATO's presence in the
Baltic region amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine But Russia has long
warned against any enlargement of NATO, reportedly accusing the alliance
of being "a tool geared towards confrontation." Ahead of its invasion of
Ukraine, it demanded that the organization, which was created in 1949 in
response to the threat posed by the Soviet Union, return to its pre-1997
borders --- something the U.S. and NATO refused. Fourteen countries have
joined the collective defense alliance since 1997, accounting for nearly
half of its members. These countries include much of Central and Eastern
Europe, and the first NATO members to border Russia and its exclave
territory of Kaliningrad: Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Moscow
blames Ukraine's pursuit of NATO membership, among other things, for
triggering the invasion, saying it threatened Russia's security. NATO
leaders have reiterated that they will not send troops into Ukraine to
help in the fight against Russia, primarily because the country is not a
member of the alliance. NATO has to prevent the war from escalating
beyond Ukraine: Secretary-general ″The persistent attempts by NATO to
draw those countries into the orbit of its interests and opportunistic
policies haven't gone unnoticed by Russia," Russian's Foreign Ministry
said in December 2021. "It's quite obvious that Finland and Sweden
joining NATO ... would have serious military and political consequences
that would require an adequate response from the Russian side," ministry
spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at the time. Risks abound Finland's and
Sweden's leaders say they are aware of the risk of escalation. "We also
need to be very frank about consequences and risks. There are both
short-term and more long-term risks. These risks are there both if we
apply and if we do not apply," Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said
during a news conference Wednesday. The leaders of Finland and Sweden
have both said a decision on whether to apply for NATO membership can be
expected sooner rather than later. The leaders of Finland and Sweden
have both said a decision on whether to apply for NATO membership can be

wrought on Ukraine in a matter of weeks, Marin pointed to the
significance of being a fully fledged NATO member, rather than just a
partner, which is its current status. "[The difference between being a
partner and being a member is very clear and will remain so," Marin
said. "There is no other way to have security guarantees than under
NATO's deterrence and common defense as guaranteed by NATO's Article 5."
The alliance's Article 5 embodies the principle of collective defense.
In short, Article 5 means that an attack against one NATO member is

#### Finland and Sweden NATO alliance leads to Russian response in the form of nukes

May 'Trigger' Response -- Putin",

[Sweden and Finland's anticipated bid for NATO membership "doesn't pose
a threat" to Russia but **may "trigger a response**," President Vladimir
Putin said at a summit of former Soviet allies on Monday]{.underline}.
The two Nordic countries have made historic steps toward joining the
U.S.-led military bloc in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
citing the need to guarantee their security from feared Russian
aggression. [Speaking at the Collective Security Treaty Organization
(CSTO) summit in Moscow, Putin said that while Russia "doesn't have
problems" with either country, the expansion of NATO's military
infrastructure across their territory may "trigger a response." "What
kind \[of response\] it will be, we will decide depending on threats
that are created against us," Putin warned]{.underline}. [Putin noted
that NATO's "expansionist politics" which led the alliance "to overstep
its intended geographic boundaries" warrants the Kremlin to keep a close
watch on the situation. NATO's role was also highlighted in the
collective statement issued by the CSTO. "Realizing our responsibility
for ensuring lasting peace in the Eurasian region]{.underline}, we
emphasize the importance of de-escalating tensions in the continent and
reaffirm our readiness for practical cooperation with NATO," the
statement says. Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 after its
demands for NATO and the United States to permanently bar Ukraine from
joining the alliance and to halt NATO expansion in what Moscow sees as
its sphere of influence were refused.

### 2nc - hypersonics

#### Russia claiming they possess hypersonic nuclear weapons increases the chance of nuclear war

**[[Russia]{.mark} has [claimed that]{.mark} some of its [hypersonic
weapons can carry a nuclear warhead]{.mark}. This statement alone is a
cause for [concern whether or not it is true]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [If
Russia ever operates this system against an enemy, that country would
have to decide the probability of the weapon being conventional or
nuclear.]{.underline} In the case of the US, **[[if]{.mark} the
[determination were made that the weapon was
nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline}**, then there is a very high likelihood
that **[[the US]{.mark} would [consider]{.mark} this [a first-strike
attack]{.mark} [and respond by unloading its nuclear weapons on
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The hypersonic **[[speed of these weapons
\[means\]]{.mark} increases the precariousness of the
situation]{.underline}** because the time for **[[any last-minute
diplomatic resolution would be severely reduced]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[It is the destabilizing influence that modern hypersonic missiles
represent that is perhaps the greatest risk they pose]{.underline}. I
believe the US and its allies should rapidly field their own hypersonic
weapons to bring other nations such as Russia and China to the
negotiating table to develop a diplomatic approach to managing these
weapons. What is hypersonic? [Describing a vehicle as hypersonic means
that it flies much faster than the speed of sound, which is 761 miles
per hour]{.underline} (1,225 kilometers per hour) at sea level and 663
mph (1,067 kph) at 35,000 feet (10,668 meters) where passenger jets fly.
Passenger jets travel at just under 600 mph (966 kph), whereas
hypersonic systems operate at speeds of 3,500 mph (5,633 kph) -- about 1
mile (1.6 kilometers) per second -- and higher. [Hypersonic systems have
been in use for decades]{.underline}. When John Glenn came back to Earth
in 1962 from the first US crewed flight around the Earth, his capsule
entered the atmosphere at hypersonic speed. All of the intercontinental
ballistic missiles in the world's nuclear arsenals are hypersonic,
reaching about 15,000 mph (24,140 kph), or about 4 miles (6.4 km) per
second at their maximum velocity. ICBMs are launched on large rockets
and then fly on a predictable trajectory that takes them out of the
atmosphere into space and then back into the atmosphere again. The new
generation of hypersonic missiles fly very fast, but not as fast as
ICBMs. They are launched on smaller rockets that keep them within the
upper reaches of the atmosphere. Hypersonic missiles are not as fast as
intercontinental ballistic missiles but are able to vary their
trajectories. U.S. Government Accounting Office Three types of
hypersonic missiles There are three different types of non-ICBM
hypersonic weapons: aero-ballistic, glide vehicles and cruise missiles.
A hypersonic aero-ballistic system is dropped from an aircraft,
accelerated to hypersonic speed using a rocket and then follows a
ballistic, meaning unpowered, trajectory. [The system Russian forces
used to attack Ukraine, the Kinzhal, is an aero-ballistic missile. The
technology has been around since about 1980]{.underline}. The type of
hypersonic missile Russia has used in Ukraine, the Kinzhal
aero-ballistic missile, is essentially a ballistic missile launched from
aircraft. It is not as advanced as other types of hypersonic missiles
that Russia, China and the US are developing. Photo: Russian Defense
Ministry Press Service via AP/The Conversation A hypersonic glide
vehicle is boosted on a rocket to high altitude and then glides to its
target, maneuvering along the way. Examples of hypersonic glide vehicles
include China's Dongfeng-17, Russia's Avangard and the US Navy's
Conventional Prompt Strike system. US officials have expressed concern
that China's hypersonic glide vehicle technology is further advanced
than the US system. A hypersonic cruise missile is boosted by a rocket
to hypersonic speed and then uses an air-breathing engine called a
scramjet to sustain that speed. Because they ingest air into their
engines, hypersonic cruise missiles require smaller launch rockets than
hypersonic glide vehicles, which means they can cost less and be
launched from more places. Hypersonic cruise missiles are under
development by China and the US. The US reportedly conducted a test
flight of a scramjet hypersonic missile in March 2020. Difficult to
defend against The primary reason nations are developing these
next-generation **[[hypersonic weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** is how
**[[difficult]{.mark} they are [to defend against]{.mark} due to their
speed, maneuverability and flight path]{.underline}**. [The US is
starting to develop a layered approach to defending against hypersonic
weapons that includes a constellation of sensors in space and close
cooperation with key allies]{.underline}. This approach is likely to be
very expensive and take many years to implement. With all of this
activity on hypersonic weapons and defending against them, it is
important to assess the threat they pose to national security.
**[Hypersonic missiles with conventional, non-nuclear warheads are
primarily useful against high-value targets, such as an aircraft
carrier. Being able to take out such a target could have a significant
impact on the outcome of a major conflict.]{.underline}**

#### Russia's "escalate to deescalate" doctrine makes the risk of using hypersonics even more likely

Beijing is expanding and diversifying its nuclear capabilities on an
unprecedented scale. The commander of U.S. Strategic Command, Adm.
Charles Richard, called it "breathtaking." Discovery of the construction
of nearly 250 new land-based ICBM silos in the summer of 2021 undermines
the idea that China is still adhering to its long-standing "minimum
deterrent" nuclear force. The silo expansion could mean China could soon
rival the U.S.' land-based ICBM force. China has also sent its nuclear
strike force to sea on submarines and is developing a strategic bomber
leg as part of what will soon be a nuclear triad. Beijing is also
developing unique ways to deliver its nukes. Last year, China stunned
many by testing a fractional orbital bombardment system, which
circumnavigated the globe before releasing a nuclear-capable
hypersonic glide vehicle at a target. That increase in Beijing's nuclear
numbers and capabilities raises the specter of parity or near-parity
with the U.S.---or even superiority. That's a chilling thought in an era
of great power competition and the level of strategic distrust that
exists between Washington and Beijing. [Besides modernizing its nuclear
force, Russia is also diversifying it, testing and deploying a number of
novel nuclear weapons.]{.underline} [Those nontraditional
nuclear-capable weapons systems include an ICBM, three hypersonic
weapons, a long-range nuclear-powered underwater torpedo, and an
unlimited-range nuclear-powered cruise missile]{.underline}. [Add to
that a concern about Russia's doctrine for its nonstrategic (i.e.,
low-yield) nuclear weapons, aka battlefield or tactical
nukes]{.underline}. [Moscow's "escalate to deescalate" doctrine
contemplates using a tactical nuke in a conventional conflict with NATO
to end resistance to its aggression by crossing the nuclear
threshold]{.underline}. Considering Russia's belligerence in
Europe, [those small nukes are a big problem for
NATO]{.underline}. [Weapons of mass destruction also include chemical
and biological weapons---and their recent use is deeply
troubling.]{.underline} Indeed, Israel reportedly struck targets in
Syria that might be involved in the production of chemical weapons. The
Damascus regime has already used chemical weapons against civilians in
Syria's civil war---and could use them in a conflict with Israel. Also,
don't forget Russia's use of a nerve agent against political opponents
Sergei Skripal and Alexei Navalny or North Korea's use of VX nerve agent
to assassinate Kim's half-brother. While we've not seen a biological
weapon used, the COVID-19 pandemic painfully reminds us of the potential
power of a purposely unleashed biological pathogen. [No one likes to
think about these horrific weapons, especially in the hands of troubling
regimes, but unfortunately, due to their destructive power, we're going
to have to in 2022.]{.underline}
