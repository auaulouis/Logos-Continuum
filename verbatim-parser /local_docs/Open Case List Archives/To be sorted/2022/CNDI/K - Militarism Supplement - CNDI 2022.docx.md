### AI

#### **The AI industry is fueling neocolonialism, especially targeting the Global South**

**Hao 22** (Karen Hao, senior AI editor at MIT Technology Review,
covering the field's cutting-edge research and its impacts on society,
April 19^th^ 2022, "Artificial intelligence is creating a new colonial
world order" Mit technology Review,

-- Cayden Mayer

[The AI industry does not seek to capture land]{.underline} as the
conquistadors of the Caribbean and Latin America did[, but the same
desire for profit drives it to expand its reach]{.underline}. [The more
users a company can acquire for its products, the more subjects it can
have for its algorithms, and the more resources---data---it can harvest
from their activities, their movements, and even their
bodies]{.underline}. Neither does the industry still exploit labor
through mass-scale slavery, which necessitated the propagation of racist
beliefs that dehumanized entire populations. [But it has developed new
ways of exploiting cheap and precarious labor, often in the Global
South, shaped by implicit ideas that such populations don't need---or
are less deserving of---livable wages and economic
stability]{.underline}. MIT Technology Review\'s new AI Colonialism
series digs [in]{.underline}to these and other parallels between AI
development and the colonial past by examining communities that have
been profoundly changed by the technology. In part one, we head to
[South Africa]{.underline}, where [AI surveillance tools, built on the
extraction of people's behaviors and faces, are re-entrenching racial
hierarchies and fueling a digital apartheid. In]{.underline} part two,
we head to [Venezuela]{.underline}, where [AI data-labeling firms found
cheap]{.underline} and desperate [workers]{.underline} amid a
devastating economic crisis, [creating a new model of labor
exploitation.]{.underline} The series also looks at ways to move away
from these dynamics. In part three, we visit ride-hailing drivers in
Indonesia who, by building power through community, are learning to
resist algorithmic control and fragmentation[. In]{.underline} part
four, we end in [Aotearoa]{.underline}, the Māori name for New Zealand,
where [an Indigenous couple are wresting back control of their
community's data to revitalize its language]{.underline}. Together, the
stories reveal how AI is impoverishing the communities and countries
that don't have a say in its development---the same communities and
countries already impoverished by former colonial empires. They also
suggest how AI could be so much more---a way for the historically
dispossessed to reassert their culture, their voice, and their right to
determine their own future.

#### The 1AC's shift towards artificial intelligence is a tool of military domination that fuels an endless cycle of warfare

The robotic revolution Robots have disrupted the social and economic
spaces of human coexistence for decades. In 1961, General Motors
installed the first industrial robotic arm -- Unimate -- on its assembly
lines in New Jersey. Since then, [robots have migrated from factories to
**the social spaces of everyday life**]{.underline}. According to one
report, there are over 8.4 million robots globally, with a market value
in excess of \$15 billion (Kadtke and Wells, 2014: 43). And with the
exponential leaps in microprocessing power predicted by Moore's Law, we
now stand on the verge of a 'Cambrian' [explosion of robotic life on
planet earth. This has big consequences for the spaces of security and
violence]{.underline}. On the ground, in the air, and underwater,
[military robots are eroding the human monopoly on
violence]{.underline}. 'Today, [the world is approaching a robotics
revolution in military affairs]{.underline} that may be on par with the
introduction of gun-powder, levée en masse, and the advent of nuclear
weapons' (Sukman, 2015: 44). The coming decades will see [US soldiers
augmented, replaced, and wounded by artificial warriors, which 'has the
potential to **change our basic core concepts of defense
strategy'**]{.underline} (Work and Brimley, 2014: 6). Yet the robotic
revolution must be [placed within **a longer trajectory of
capital-intensive warfare**]{.underline} (see Edgerton, 1991). [This
liberal form of violence aims to **use technological superiority to
'solve' the problem of 'uncivilized' states and actors**]{.underline}
(Mabee, 2016). Accordingly, [the US military continues to project peace
through capital, security through technics.]{.underline} In 2014, the
USA accounted for just over half of global arms sales in a \$70 billion
annual industry (Theohary, 2015). Still, robots are disrupting the
architectures of capital-intensive warfare. The future-oriented 20YY:
Preparing for War in the Robotic Age sheds light on the US military's
production of robotic geopolitical futures. Co-authored by Deputy
Secretary of Defense Robert O. Work, it insists that 'U.S. defense
leaders should begin to prepare ... for war in the Robotic Age' (Work
and Brimley, 2014: 5). A similar report by the Pentagon-funded National
Defense University explores how [evolutions in synthetic life, robotics,
and artificial intelligence will transform US dominance]{.underline}
(Kadtke and Wells, 2014). At the outset of the invasion of Iraq, the US
military had zero ground robots. By the end of 2008, there were 12,000,
including iRobot's PackBot, which was integral to counter--improvised
explosive device (IED) missions. Aerial robots continue to disrupt the
spaces, subjects, and geopolitics of US conflict (Shaw, 2016). Indeed,
what Kate Kindervater (2016) calls ['lethal surveillance' has
transformed US geopolitics. The Pentagon now stocks a fleet of well over
12,000 aerial drones]{.underline} (US Department of Defense, 2013).
Controversially, medium-altitude Predator and Reaper drones have been
deployed outside of 'hot' battlefields in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia
(Shaw and Akhter, 2012). And on a smaller scale, the US Army is
researching how to equip its soldiers with [tiny pocket-sized drones for
'over the hill' surveillance, which could revolutionize infantry
tactics.]{.underline} Within the USA, Predators and Reapers are
routinely flown by US Customs and Border Patrol along the Mexico and
Canadian borderlands. And back on the ground, \$55 million has been
spent on transferring 1000 military ground robots to police forces
across 43 US states (Center for the Study of the Drone, 2016). On 7 July
2016, [Dallas Police Department became the first to use an exploding
robot to kill an armed suspect]{.underline}. A robot red-letter day.
How, then, can we piece together these developments? Former secretary of
defense Chuck Hagel unveiled the Defense Innovation Initiative, also
known as the 'third offset strategy', on 15 November 2014. [Underpinned
by robotics, cyber warfare, autonomy, 3D printing, electric weapons,
miniaturization, and the internet of things, this strategy is **designed
to sustain US technological dominance in the 21st
century**]{.underline}. The 'third offset' follows precedents in the
Cold War. To offset Soviet numerical advantages in the 1950s, the US
military invested heavily in nuclear weapons. The second offset strategy
of the 1970s was driven by stealth, the Global Positioning System (GPS),
and network-centric systems. In both cases, technology was translated
into US military dominance. Yet, unlike in the Cold War, [the robotic
revolution today is sweeping across multiple nations]{.underline} (and
non-state actors), not just the US and Soviet militaryindustrial
complexes[. Thus, US empire confronts a robotizing warscape that is both
**global and unpredictable.**]{.underline} US empire: Towards a proxy
army of robots In the preface to the 2015 National Security Strategy, US
President Barack Obama declared, 'We possess a military whose might,
technology, and geostrategic reach is unrivalled in human history'
(White House, 2015). Rarely, however, is 'empire' used in official
parlance. Yet, as Mabee (2004: 1360) suggests, 'while "lonely
superpower", "unipolar", and other monikers have been utilized, [the US
as empire]{.underline} seems to convey a richer understanding and a
deeper resonance of America's contemporary role'. But what exactly is
empire? 'Empires are usually states', replies Zielonka (2012: 519), 'but
they are states of a peculiar nature.' Can a statecentric understanding
capture the global infrastructures of US military power? For Dalby
(2005: 435), 'If empire is to be of analytical use, it seems that none
of the versions of it in circulation are quite adequate to grapple with
nuances of the present.' Accordingly, the concept of empire [must
connect the geographies of contemporary technics with past
materializations.]{.underline} As Parker (2010: 128) concludes, 'for all
its differences from nineteenth- and twentieth-century examples, the
geopolitics of empires is likely to be found in the present and in the
future'. US history is inscribed by imperialism. For Munro (2014: 1567),
'continuing to think of US history in imperial terms enables us to see
how the present arrives already fundamentally shaped by past economic
disparity, racial inequality, hetero-patriarchal oppression and a deep
interrelation between the realms of foreign and domestic'. Accordingly,
Heumann (2011) argues that the USA has always been an empire-state
rather than a nation-state, inheriting the precedents of European
empires. [Practices of racial domination and expansionism underwrote US
state formation and early capitalism, leaving a legacy of
segregation]{.underline}. Fast forward to the 19th century, and the
so-called Monroe Doctrine of 1823 articulated the belief that the USA
was a guardian against European intervention in the 'New World'. Under
President Woodrow Wilson, this moral imperative was reworked into an
idealistic vision for spreading democracy across the planet. The grim
parade of US proxy wars and black ops during the Cold War --
particularly in Latin America -- entrenched the idea that the USA was
the guardian of western civilization. Despite this history of foreign
intervention, the USA has consistently escaped the label of empire
(Johnson, 2004a). This did change during the 'war on terror', as the
Bush administration adopted 'a new ideological commitment to empire'
(Agnew, 2003: 883). Consider the now infamous boast of White House
adviser Karl Rove: 'We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our
own reality' (originally quoted in Suskind, 2004). Supporters of US
empire ranged from liberal interventionists to neoconservative hawks.
[Under both visions, 'the US state is thus seen as an imperial state
overseeing a global empire which brings benefits to both other Western
states and also the inhabitants of war-torn states']{.underline}
(Stokes, 2005: 219). Or, as Michael Ignatieff (2003) declared, 'The 21st
century imperium is a new invention in the annals of political science,
an empire lite, a global hegemony whose grace notes are free markets,
human rights and democracy, enforced by the most awesome military power
the world has ever known.' Others find the idea of US empire implausible
in an era of global capital (Hardt and Negri, 2000: 384). Empire is
viewed instead as a deterritorialized form of capitalist world
sovereignty. Yet globalization should not imply a flat and frictionless
world of capital. The USA has long been the leader of an uneven world
capitalism since the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944. Accordingly,
'there is a geography of globalisation: one that rests on an imperial
centre' (Mabee, 2004: 1360). Thus, while capitalist logics are vital in
explaining geopolitics, so too are the planetary materialities of US
empire. **[Empires entrench their power through technics]{.underline}**.
No human sovereign is as awe-inspiring as the technical background that
secures humanity across the planet. The question then becomes, [how will
US empire materialize -- and maintain -- its dominance in an age of
global robotics, technological diffusion, and powerful non-state
actors?]{.underline} If the third offset strategy is an indication, US
empire will reconstitute **[by shifting to a permanent, robotic proxy
war]{.underline}**. Since World War II, [the practice of total warfare
between states has diminished and proxy wars have increased]{.underline}
(Kaldor, 2012). One of the most infamous examples in US history was the
CIAfunded Afghan mujahedeen in the 1980s. More recently, the Pentagon
spent billions on private military contractors in Iraq. But rather than
outsource military power to human contractors, US military surrogates of
the future could be replaced by robots: private military contractors
without flesh, risk, or vulnerability (or healthcare costs). As Mumford
(2013: 43) suggests, ['developments in communications and information
technology have the potential to nullify the twentieth-century belief in
"boots on the ground" as a proxy-war necessity']{.underline}. **[An army
of robots can entrench US power without humans on the
ground]{.underline}**. And, just as importantly, these artificial
warriors are profitable commodities (Shaw, 2017). A robotic [US empire
thus advances proxy warfare]{.underline} -- and capitalism -- to its
most logical conclusion.

#### The ontological condition of AI is INSEPERABLE from military domination---its autonomy establishes the basis for predicting and sustaining new warscapes

**Shaw '17** (Ian G.R. Shaw, Associate Professor of Global Security

Sciences of the University of Glasgow; 9/31/17, "Robot Wars: US Empire

Autonomous futures Autonomy -- and [AI more generally -- is central to
the future of US geopolitics]{.underline}. The Defense Science Board
(2016: 3) writes that the ['ongoing rapid transition of autonomy into
warfighting capabilities is **vital if the U.S. is to sustain military
advantage'.**]{.underline} Unlike automation, an autonomous system
possesses adaptable intelligence. This [enables it to be 'goal-directed
in unpredictable environments and situations']{.underline} (US Air
Force, 2016: 30). Autonomous weapons are not entirely new: since the
1980s the US Navy has installed autonomous Phalanx CIWS Gatling Guns on
many of its battleships. Nonetheless, [the contemporary warscape is
being transformed by 'an emerging class of robotic weapons, including
drones, mobile sea mines, automated turrets, remote-controlled machine
guns, as well as weaponized computer programs']{.underline} (Bolton,
2015: 41). Several autonomous drones -- the US Navy's MQ-8 Fire Scout,
the UK's Taranis drones, and the Anglo-French Unmanned Combat Air System
-- promise to revolutionize air combat. Fearing this geopolitical
pathway, 1000 leading scientists called for a ban on autonomous robotics
in 2015, citing the existential risks to humanity. Similarly, Human
Rights Watch and the International Human Rights Clinic (2016) continue
to demand the prohibition of what they term 'killer robots'. The US
military regularly produces roadmaps that imagine autonomous futures:
from robots extracting causalities to swarms of drones overwhelming
enemies. 'Autonomy in unmanned systems will be critical to future
conflicts that will be fought and won with technology' (US Department of
Defense, 2013: 67). [Multiple reasons are given to justify the
Pentagon's quest for autonomy: future threats will be too complex for
human reactions, autonomous robots can function if they lose radio
contact, and using pilots to oversee multiple robots is more
cost-effective. Finally, autonomous systems can analyze huge streams of
real-time data 'in ways that humans cannot by addressing volume,
complexity, speed, and continuity']{.underline} (Defense Science Board,
2016: 47). [Autonomy thus enables robots **'to make and execute complex
decisions'**]{.underline} (US Army, 2010: 65). Future pilots would
direct swarms of intelligent drones with a geographic information system
(GIS) program: on the loop but not in the loop. 'The end result would be
a revolution in the roles of humans in air warfare' (US Air Force, 2009:
50). This standard of AI enables future drones to break with the
restrictions of existing unmanned systems. 'Future \[unmanned aircraft\]
will evolve from being robots operated at a distance to independent
robots, able to self-actualize to perform a given task' (US Department
of Defense, 2005: 52). [This self-actualization enables the evolution
from autonomous targeting to the more controversial step of autonomous
attacking]{.underline} (US Department of Defense, 2007: 54). Yet, [while
the US military is a world leader in robotics today, **it will face
future 'unknown unknowns' from other militaries and non-state
grou**ps]{.underline}. For example, there is growing concern within the
Pentagon that US soldiers are now vulnerable to (swarms of) terrorist
drones on the battlefield. Accordingly, the drone-on-drone warfare of
the future will produce highly contested airspaces, fueling a robot arms
race of offensive and defensive systems. [Autonomy, however, is more
than just artificial intelligence: **it is an ontological
condition**]{.underline}. [Robots, like all technologies, materialize
unique techno-geographies and techno-politics]{.underline} (Hecht,
2011). Rather than being slavish instruments of human minds, [robots are
geopolitical actors that disrupt and reinvent the worldly conditions of
state power, **installing ontological coordinates -- predictable and
unpredictable -- for future military violence**]{.underline}. The
[epistemological problem of if, or **how, we go to war is inseparable
from background material conditions**]{.underline}. Drones, for example,
continue to transform the ethics of targeted killing (see Walters,
2014). '[Drones enable the (de)politicization of targets by abstracting
human life into a techno-political entity that can be captured in
clinical terms as data]{.underline}' (Schwarz, 2016: 61). So, while
robots do not straightforwardly determine military operations, [they
nonetheless **recondition their field of possibilities**]{.underline}.
'Robots, then, may not only make it easier to start a war ... [they may
actually change our military and political doctrines and
activities']{.underline} (Coeckelbergh, 2011: 271). In short, robots
always already possess a degree of ontological autonomy because [they
reconfigure the conditions of **a more-than-human
warscape.**]{.underline}

#### **New harvesting of data in the global south perpetuates the old colonial structures** 

**Adams and Alvarado '22** (Kimberly Adams, correspondent with
Marketplace Tech covering the intersection between politics and the
economy, with a special focus on how federal policy affects the bottom
line for businesses and individuals. Jesus Alvarado, Assistant Producer
at Marketplace by APM, May 10^th^ 2022, "Will the future of AI repeat
past injustices?" Marketplace,
https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/will-the-future-of-ai-repeat-past-injustices/)

Artificial intelligence has changed our world in major ways: autonomous
vehicles, speech-recognition technology and algorithms that change what
we see and hear on social media platforms. [But the technology and the
data fueling AI is often powered by low-paid workers in developing
countries]{.underline}, including many nations in the Global South. Some
academics describes this as [AI colonialism, suggesting that what goes
into artificial intelligence is repeating exploitative colonial
history.]{.underline} I spoke with journalist Karen Hao, who recently
published a series on AI colonialism in MIT Technology Review. The
following is an edited transcript of our conversation. Karen Hao: [With
artificial intelligence]{.underline}, what [we]{.underline} now [have is
these really wealthy companies that have become the empires of people's
data, of computational resources. And they are going to other
communities that don't have the same financial resources, computational
resources, taking their data, their precious voices, or their faces, or
their body movements and then turning that into software that
powers,]{.underline} essentially, our internet. Kimberly Adams: You
write about how deep-learning AI techniques rely on "ghost work." Can
you explain what that is? Hao: [One of the more famous ghost work
examples is content moderation.]{.underline} There are actually
thousands and tens of thousands of people that are labeling videos and
saying "this has violence, this has nudity, this has some other
inappropriate content." So that's what ghost work is, [it's like this
entire economy of people, primarily in the Global South, that do work to
make sure people in the Global North have a clean, efficient internet
experience]{.underline}. Adams: [Is this a legacy of colonialism, or a
new kind of colonialism?]{.underline} Hao: I think [it's
both.]{.underline} There's a sort of path dependence that we now have,
where because of our global history there are certain populations that
now are sort of predisposed to do certain kinds of work in this AI
development pipeline. But then [we're also seeing this history be
codified into artificial intelligence, because these AI algorithms, when
they learn on data, what they're really doing is they're learning on
historical data]{.underline}. It's essentially bringing our past into
the future with us. Adams: Your series focuses on the Global South. Can
you give a few examples of how this is showing up there? Hao: In the
first story, we go to South Africa, and we look at the surveillance
industry there, specifically AI surveillance technologies, so
technologies that are built on the extraction of people's movements and
people's faces to then reidentify them, to track them. [South Africa,
obviously, has this really awful history of apartheid. But what is also
happening is it's now sort of perpetuating a digital apartheid of sorts,
because the people that are able to buy these surveillance
technologies]{.underline} --- because South Africa has a very privatized
surveillance industry --- are the people that traditionally have wealth.
And so it's predominantly white people. [And then the people who are
surveilled, and don't have the wealth to actually object to this kind of
surveillance, are the people who didn't have wealth before --- they're
predominantly Black]{.underline}. So we look at stories like this all
around the world, where different phenomenons are playing out, where
both the local population is subjected to something because of the
dispossession that they had globally with former colonizers suppressing
their economic development, and therefore leaving them at the bottom of
the food chain, and also potentially perpetuating the hierarchy within
the countries as well, because of these dynamics that play out. Adams:
How much awareness do you think there is of this dynamic among the
general population? Hao: I don't think there's even an awareness among
artificial intelligence researchers, to be honest. With this series,
what I was trying to do was really expand the surface of the
conversation: Why does AI not fundamentally work for everyone? And only
by identifying really the root of the issue, can we then eradicate it
and actually reimagine an AI that does work for everyone. Adams: Who
would be the major players involved in shifting the balance, or perhaps
that are already involved in perpetuating the system? Hao: I think, in
shifting the balance, really everyone can be involved. [But the
heavyweight AI players that are the ones that entrench these systems
currently --- those are the big tech companies]{.underline}, and all of
the companies that support them. [The smaller tech companies as
well,]{.underline} they're all sort of engaged in this stuff: Instacart,
Uber, Lyft, the entire ecosystem of companies that use any form of
algorithms and automation to increase the efficiency and convenience for
people in the Global North. [They are definitely part and parcel of this
broader colonial dynamic that's happening.]{.underline} And so to shift
it, it really requires not just people within these companies to
actually push and pressure their leadership, it also requires civil
society to push and pressure regulators to introduce regulation. It
requires international coordination, too. In my second story, when I
talk about Venezuela and the fact that a lot of Venezuelans are now
being caught up in this ghost work labor, a researcher said to me: "It
doesn't really matter if Venezuelans rise up and try to resist this,
because then the company is just going to move to the next poor
population." And so there has to be sort of an international consortium
of, not just tech employees, regulators and civil society organizations
all have to coordinate as well, to figure out what are the norms that we
should be establishing internationally to make sure that these
technologies are more humane.

#### Data colonialism prevents the Global South rom accessing their own resources, deepening the economic and technical divide

**Lmi '20** ( Nima Elmi, head of government affairs at the World
Economic Forum, November 11^th^ 2020, "Is Big Tech Setting Africa Back?"
Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/11/11/is-big-tech-setting-africa-back/>)

Technology transcends national borders, so it shouldn't be surprising
that, [in 2020, private technology and telecommunication companies
control more data on the average person than governments
do]{.underline}. And it's not just data ownership: Policymakers
similarly fall behind in understanding the power of data. That's a
problem, particularly as social media platforms are able to influence
political outcomes with few to no repercussions and geopolitics becomes
a duopoly of technological trailblazers like the United States and
China, with the rest of the world looking on as spectators---and
reluctant participants[. The coronavirus pandemic has moved many
people's lives online and demonstrated the revolutionary power of
technology in driving economic growth despite physical
stasis]{.underline}---whether in e-commerce, continuing employment for
those able to work digitally, or virtual schooling. This dramatic shift
wouldn't have been possible without artificial intelligence (AI)
embedded within now-essential services like Alexa, Siri, and Zoom.
Artificial intelligence is usually talked about in sensationalist terms.
But hyperbolic language can mask simple business truths: AI
capabilities---understanding everything from shopping habits to future
careers or propensity for criminality---will only ever be as good as the
datasets that feed them and, without diverse data sets, the ability to
innovate and enhance existing AI functionalities is limited. The de
facto U.S.-China AI duopoly doesn't accurately represent the
cross-cutting, global consumer bases tech companies serve; for the game
to go on, spectators need to pitch in---lest they lose their pastime.
[It is against this backdrop---a thirst for new data to keep the AI
engine chugging---that colonialism has morphed into its latest form:
data colonialism. Data colonialism is driven by the control of data as a
proxy for the control of people and is quickly becoming the reality
faced by many emerging economies today. Far from decolonized, these
countries are subject to the whims of Big Tech's unfettered rise;
vulnerable peoples' data is used to enhance companies' innovations,
entrench their economic and political might, and, in effect, occupy the
daily lives of billions of people. Data extraction, monopolization, and
monetization are data colonialism's core tenets. Africa is ground zero
for data colonialism.]{.underline} It is the continent with the largest
number of countries; most cultural, linguistic and racial diversity;
least connected nations; and its data protection regulations range from
limited to nonexistent. [Africa has always been a continent rich in
natural resources, and, today, the diversity of the continent's
population renders it equally rich in data resources]{.underline}. But
Big Tech's exploitation of this diversity---heralded under the guise of
internet-for-all initiatives---actually undermines the data sovereignty
of African nations and impedes their ability to develop their own
digital economies. That's hardly a tide that lifts all boats. In 2017,
data overtook oil to become the world's most valuable commodity, but it
remains hard to define. At its most basic level, data is
us---humans---in digital form: how we look; the languages we speak; our
viewing preferences, medical records, voices, learning habits, and music
preferences. For AI, all data is valuable fodder---enhancing algorithms'
capabilities and generating revenue for the companies that collect it.
[When it comes to obtaining this data, the latest figures from the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development highlight just how vulnerable Africa
is in comparison to its European counterparts. In Europe, 96 percent of
countries currently have data protection laws in place---versus only 50
percent in Africa.]{.underline} Globally, only 43 percent of the U.N.'s
designated Least Developed Countries (LDCs) have such laws; 33 out of
the 47 LDCs are in Africa[. As well as the unrivaled, diverse datasets
that Africa offers tech companies, the continent's relative absence of
data protection policies---and a limited understanding of how valuable
and influential data can be---is a central causal factor behind its
vulnerability to data colonialism]{.underline}. There are myriad reasons
for this vacuum in regulation on the continent, including a general lack
of capacity, conflicting priorities, and political instability[. Data
colonialism is at times conflated with humanitarian efforts---after all,
who can object to expanding digital access, which nearly all agree is
crucial for economic growth? But corporations' support for emerging
economies may be a double-edged sword, as data extraction undermines
African nations' abilities to develop indigenous digital economies that
can enhance their own capabilities.]{.underline} It's farcical to assume
corporations' forays in Africa are chiefly compelled by goodwill:
Corporations are ultimately accountable to their shareholders and driven
by their bottom lines. That comes at a cost, of which Africa bears the
brunt. Both Chinese and U.S. tech giants adopt a humanitarian framing in
marketing digital infrastructure projects, but approach the ulterior
motive of data extraction differently. Chinese corporations leverage
political initiatives like Beijing's controversial Belt and Road
Initiative to secure contracts with African governments, whereby AI and
other technology solutions are provided in exchange for access to local
citizens' data---like the deal between CloudWalk, a Chinese developer of
facial recognition software, and the Zimbabwean government. Firms are
relatively transparent about their goals, with little to no checks or
accountability on how the information they receive will be used. Western
corporations, by contrast, adopt a more covert approach, establishing
digital hubs and offering free internet access. These include Google's
Internet Balloons and Facebook's Undersea Cable, which encourage more
Africans to get online, use their services, and, by convenient
coincidence, relinquish their data in the process.

example, or genetically modified (GM) foods45---rarely dismiss
technology outright; rather they favor smaller, more transparent, or
more locally governable technological systems. The question that
preoccupies students of science and technology, then, is not whether,
but how, to integrate innovation into people's lives so as to make a
positive difference. [Years of research in the social psychology of risk
perception46 and public understanding of science47 have established that
popular fear or rejection of new technology often rests, at bottom, on
**an uneasiness about the ways in which technology is managed** or, more
accurately, governed.]{.underline} What do these observations imply for
an industry with global ambitions, like agricultural biotechnology? How,
more specifically, does [biotechnology contribute to ways of political
worldmaking beyond the nation-state]{.underline}, and what implications
do the engagements between biotechnology and global politics have for
democratic governance? In reaching for answers, it is useful to think of
biotechnology **[operating politically in several different
registers]{.underline}**. It is, of course, most plainly a material
technology[: it makes new instruments for warding off harm and
disorder]{.underline}, such as plants that resist insects, weeds, or
drought, and it redesigns pieces of nature, such as genes, to perform
new tasks in new environments. In this respect[, **biotechnology is,
concurrently, a metaphysical device;** it brings new entities into the
world and through that process **reorders our sense of rightness** in
both nature and society.48]{.underline} At the same time, [biotechnology
is a discourse: to some, of progress and improvement, beneficence and
utility; to others, **of risk, invasiveness, and domination from
afar**.]{.underline} Proponents of agricultural biotechnology tell
particular stories about a world in which plant genetic modification is
possible, and these stories carry political and cultural weight. Lastly,
[**biotechnology is an institution of governance**; it shapes forms of
social life by influencing how people choose to, or are able to, live
with the products of bio-industry.]{.underline} Each of these registers,
as we see below, has been activated in the global politics of
biotechnology. The Resisting Multitude In May 2004, a scientific journal
reported that German researchers were keeping secret the locations of
some thirty sites planted with GM corn for fear that anti-GM activists
would destroy the crops, as they previously had elsewhere in Germany.49
Failure to disclose these locations was contrary to the EU Directive
2001/18, which requires GM crop sites to be publicly registered.
Noncompliance with European law in traditionally law-abiding Germany may
have been newsworthy, but the threat to GM crops was anything but novel.
From the late 1990s onward, [attacks on field trial sites began evolving
into a form of international protest that seemed to epitomize Hardt and
Negri's thesis about an emerging, assertive, global multitude: in
Britain, hundreds of demonstrators dressed in decontamination suits
uprooted GM plants in test fields]{.underline} in 1999; in India and
Brazil, [farmers' unions organized similar protests;]{.underline} in
France, José Bové, the charismatic head of the radical Confédération
Paysanne (Peasant Confederation), became a folk hero by orchestrating
the destruction of thousands of GM plants, as well as a partially built
McDonald's outlet, in 1999. His subsequent trial, fine, and terms of
imprisonment left him and his supporters undaunted, indeed ready to
resume battle as much as five years after their initial transgressions.
Field trial sites were not the only theater of protest against GM
agriculture. [Antiglobalization activists early identified
**biotechnology as a symbol of the environmental, economic, and cultural
homogenization they wished to resist**]{.underline}. Demonstrations
against Monsanto and GM corn (or maize), together with evocations of
risks to nontarget species such as the monarch butterfly, were part of
the repertoire of street protest during the Third Ministerial Conference
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle in 1999. In this and
similar episodes, representatives of a loosely networked [global
citizenry asserted their right to debate technological futures in terms
other than those conventionally used by nation-states and their expert
advisers: the formal discourses of law, molecular biology, economics,
risk assessment, and bioethics]{.underline}. [At stake was **who had
power to determine how much global harmonization there should be** and
which scientific, technological, and economic innovations should be
allowed to diffuse throughout the world]{.underline}. Those opting for
more local, bottom-up visions won a salient victory when Monsanto
decided, under rising public pressure, to withdraw its plans to develop
sterile seed technology, through use of the so-called Terminator gene;50
later, citing a drop in global demand, the company also announced that
it would put on hold its plans to market genetically modified Roundup
Ready wheat.51 Ideology and Enforcement Not everyone saw the
antiglobalization movement as the promising vanguard of planetary
resistance against an outmoded, corporate-dominated, neoliberal world
order. Using the classical ordering machinery of science and the law,
[proponents of agricultural biotechnology sought to promote their
visions of social and technological progress**, stifling opposition and
dissent**.]{.underline} At the February 2000 annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, Senator Christopher
"Kit" Bond, Republican from Missouri, Monsanto's home state, was openly
dismissive of the Seattle protest. He [represented it as **a struggle
between scientific expertise and the misguided**, if exuberant,
ignorance of youth]{.underline}: "The scientific debate is not being
controlled by Ph.D.s but apparently by young people with a proclivity
for street theater. . . . It's coming to the point that scientists are
going to have to get dressed up as corncobs to get the attention of the
media."52 At the same meeting, Madeleine Albright, President Clinton's
secretary of state, also cast the conflict as one between reason and
unreason. "But science," she said, "does not support the 'Frankenfood'
fears of some, particularly outside the United States, that biotech
foods or other products will harm human health."53 [Both speakers, from
different political parties, enlisted science as their ally in defending
biotechnology against its critics.]{.underline} This invocation of
scientific authority in support of technological innovation is [a marker
of America's commitment to a **particular ideology of technoscientific
progress**]{.underline}.54 A look across the ocean at contemporaneous UK
debates on biotechnology helps bring into [relief the ideological
dimensions of the American position.]{.underline} The term "Frankenfood"
was widely used in the British tabloid press to reflect and, some said,
reinforce public anxieties. But concerns were not restricted to the
media and the ignorant public. The British scientific community had all
along expressed greater uncertainty about the safety of GM crops than
its American counterpart, particularly with respect to the environmental
consequences of commercial use.55 These doubts led British experts to
reject the official U.S. position that the process of genetic
modification carries no special risks; all that matters for regulatory
purposes is the end product. Scientific and public opinion in Britain
united behind a more cautious approach, demanding more
experimentation---for example, through farm-scale trials56--- before
authorizing the commercialization of GM crops. As doubts intensified,
Tony Blair's government decided on a highly unusual three-pronged review
of the science, economics, and public acceptability of these products to
reevaluate the case for their introduction.57 The immediate outcome of
this process was a decision to approve the commercialization of only one
variety of GM corn, at least to start. Thus, while American
neoliberalism treated biotechnology as just another stream of products,
adequately controlled by the market except for assessments of their
safety to human health and the environment, Britain's more cautious and
communitarian political culture granted the public some say in deciding
which products they wanted to allow into the market. Whereas
consultative procedures such as Britain's GM debate and referenda in
countries such as Denmark and Switzerland sought to defuse public
opposition, elsewhere legal sanctions were employed to beat down what
biotechnology promoters saw as unacceptable acts of intransigence. Thus,
demonstrators such as José Bové who destroyed GM crops were prosecuted
for damaging property in several countries. [At the international level,
the United States brought a case against the EU at the WTO for imposing
an allegedly illegal moratorium on the importation of GM crops and
foods.]{.underline} [Foundational to the U.S. case was the argument that
there were no good scientific reasons for keeping these products off the
European market, and that the moratorium therefore amounted to illegal
protectionism.58]{.underline} Intellectual property law, too, has been
invoked in safeguarding the investments made by multinationals such as
Monsanto in GM crops. Particularly interesting were the prosecutions
brought against farmers in the United States and Canada who were found
to be growing GM crops patented by Monsanto without a license. In the
best known of these cases, a seventy-three-year-old Saskatchewan farmer
named Percy Schmeiser was sued for growing genetically modified Roundup
Ready canola, which he claimed had blown into his fields from
neighboring farms. A 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada upheld
Monsanto's patent infringement claim, saying that Schmeiser's unlicensed
use of seed containing Monsanto's patented gene was sufficient to
constitute infringement.59 In a Solomonic turn, though, the Court
awarded no damages to Monsanto, on the ground that Schmeiser had not
benefited economically from his unlawful act; equally, Schmeiser was not
required to pay Monsanto's court costs. The case warned GM crop
producers that, under Canadian law, they would have a difficult time
collecting damages for patent infringement; [at the same time, they
could be subject to potentially unlimited liability if their seeds
accidentally contaminated, and thus damaged, the products of certified
GM-free organic farms.]{.underline}

Legibility Advertisements for agricultural biotechnology frequently show
fields of grain laid out in neat parallel lines, illustrating both the
fertility and the increased control that genetic modification can
allegedly deliver. One could hardly find more [compelling images of the
"legibility" described by]{.underline} Scott. [Intrusive weeds, barren
patches, unruly growth have all been eliminated in favor of healthy,
predictable, quantifiable yields--- **achieved through the precision of
genetic control**]{.underline}. However, [just as the midcentury grand
planners' dreams of legibility were achieved at a cost, so legibility in
modern GM agriculture **demands unseen labors of standardization, and
consequent elimination of ambiguity**, to achieve its surface
regularity.]{.underline} Four dimensions of standardization are worth
noting: [ontologies, epistemologies, socio-ecologies, and forms of life.
All four **maintain traditional relations of power** between center and
periphery]{.underline}, and all can be illustrated through the case of
"golden rice," [the poster crop for a new generation of
nutrient-enriched GM crops **to feed the developing
world**]{.underline}.60 The name was given to a strain of rice
bioengineered to produce beta-carotene, which colors the grain a pale
gold; when ingested, it converts to vitamin A in the body and protects
consumers against vitamin deficiency leading to possible blindness. [For
the products of GM agriculture to locate themselves securely in global
markets, **there has to be broad agreement on what these entities
actually are**.]{.underline} This ontological question may seem
straightforward at first---proponents of golden rice, for instance,
claim that it is nothing more than a more nutritious plant variety---but
food crops straddle too many categorical boundaries for their identity
in the political domain to be anything but hybrid. There are, to begin
with, regulatory classifications. Should a crop engineered to produce
ingredients of medicinal value be considered a food or a drug? Even if
such issues can be settled by formal administrative definitions, the
North-South debate surrounding [GM crops shows how difficult it is to
achieve ontological closure around a commodity that is at once a natural
kind (a plant with specific genes and traits) and a social
kind]{.underline} (a product of [particular economic and political
orderings, and a potential reorganizer of society]{.underline}).61 How
one should know the properties of GM crops is similarly open to
question. U.S. authorities have insisted that the only proper basis on
which to evaluate the impacts of these novel entities is through
science-based risk assessment. Yet, as the dispute between the United
States and Europe at the WTO graphically illustrates, vast disagreements
persist about the epistemological status of risk assessment. [Is it a
"science" at all, in the sense of being a well-demarcated,
uncontroversial, paradigmatic (in a Kuhnian sense) method of
representing the world; or is it instead a patently political and
**culturally constructed instrument for managing the uncertainties that
inevitably accompany large projects of reconfiguring nature or
society**]{.underline}?62 To accept producers' contention that crops
such as golden rice are "safe," one has to buy the former, not the
latter, characterization. If, however, risk assessment is an expression
of political culture by other means, then one should not be surprised if
that form of analysis does not travel friction-free across political and
cultural boundaries.63 GM crops are developed in the laboratory, usually
in science-rich Western nations, tested in the field, and transported
thence for commercial propagation in both naturally and socially
variable environments. Monsanto, in this respect, is like the Kew
Gardens of the nineteenth century: a metropolitan "center of
calculation"64 from which standardized products flow out to take root in
the world's economic and political peripheries. Key to sustaining this
mode of production is the assumption that socioecologies are as standard
as the crops grown within them---put differently, that social and
ecological circumstances at the periphery are not so radically different
from those at the metropolitan center as to defeat the project of global
technology transfer. Yet accidents occurring even within the boundaries
of single nation-states show that transfers from the laboratory to the
field can bring unpleasant surprises. For example, in one costly U.S.
episode, ProdiGene, a GM corn variety containing an insulin precursor,
trypsin,65 was planted in an unmarked field in rural Iowa. The
manufacturer agreed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which
approved the field trials, that the field would be quarantined the
following year so as to remove any volunteer plants.66 In fact, the
fields were not properly isolated and an undetermined quantity of the GM
crop was harvested along with about 500,000 bushels of soybeans during
the following season. [Similar failures resulting from unforeseen
couplings of technology, environment, and human behavior are all the
more probable when transfers occur across disparate cultures of farming
and of hazard control]{.underline}. Expanding on this point, it has
become clear that [complex technological systems are forms of life,
uniting human and nonhuman components in a common purposive framework,
as much as they are targeted attempts to improve upon aspects of human
life by physical or biological means]{.underline}. Thus, transportation
systems do not only move people about from place to place. They remake
social structures and self-understandings. A car culture, for example,
gives rise to different visions, and valuations, of time, distance,
autonomy, community, environmental quality, and the cost of life than a
culture dependent chiefly on bicycles or public transportation does.
Similarly, industrial agriculture is organized and managed on different
principles from small family farms; the two systems of production rest
on different economic, social, and technological infrastructures, and
their impacts on human solidarity and on the environment are
correspondingly divergent. [Conventional risk assessment methods take
little or no account of the social and ethical ramifications of
technological systems, including the threats they pose to long-settled
patterns of living]{.underline}. [This blindness to technology's
disruption of established forms of life, underwritten by the allegedly
scientific power of risk assessment, has fueled much of the criticism of
agricultural biotechnology in the global South]{.underline}.67 Identity
and Community Empires, no less than nation-states, engender and depend
on feelings of belonging. Devices for producing imperial imagined
communities have included, besides the grand, polarizing, ideological
discourses of the cold war, mundane practices such as performing
national celebrations,68 teaching a common language, training
administrative and judicial élites, and building infrastructures for
commerce and communication. [Science and technology, we have seen, have
long served as agents of imperial governmentality, helping to produce
the mission consciousness and the associated forms of knowledge and
skill that serve as instruments for extending power]{.underline}. Modern
[biotechnology, similarly, provides a discourse of **development that
continues colonial traditions,** although the agents, recipients, and
specific mechanisms of the development project have been partially
reconfigured in modern times.]{.underline} The discovery of Africa as a
site for biotechnological development, through the propagation of crops
such as golden rice, offers perhaps the clearest illustration. In the
rhetoric of development specialists, and the scientific and industrial
institutions that serve them[, Africa is represented through tropes of
crisis and charity that render the continent's condition as dire and the
offers of scientific and technological solutions as
salvationary.]{.underline}69 In one instructive example, Gordon Conway,
former president of the Rockefeller Foundation, and a colleague wrote an
article in the prestigious journal Science on biotechnology's capacity
to help Africans. Though presented as scientific, the article merged the
empiricist register of science with a narrative register that was little
short of missionary. At the center of the discussion was a fictional
African housewife, "Mrs. Namurunda," who the authors said was not a real
person but "a composite of situations existing in Africa."70 The story
begins with Mrs. Namurunda, a farmer and single mother, eking out a
hard-scrabble existence on fields infested with every form of insect
blight, under adverse conditions of drought and soil degradation. It
ends with scientific biotechnology solving her problems, enabling her to
turn a profit and secure a brighter, better educated, more enlightened
future for her children. This script follows Foucault's delineation of
biopower with uncanny precision. An entire continent becomes a
medicalized body, requiring urgent therapeutic intervention, both as a
collective and for its individual members. The fictional person of Mrs.
Namurunda, unveiled in the pages of one of the world's leading
scientific journals, becomes a symbol for Africa's "composite" ailments.
Advanced societies' power to develop and deliver the requisite
treatments offers them the right, indeed the obligation, to engage in a
new mission civilisatrice---built on a biomedical ethic of cure rather
than, as in earlier times, a religious model of grace. But, this time,
eschewing the forceful, state-led constellations of power that
undergirded colonial rule, [the neoliberal state works through a lightly
regulated global industry and a largely selfregulating scientific
community. Their expansion into new territories carries the promise of
better jobs and higher incomes back in the home country, thereby
allowing the economically more powerful state to justify itself where
votes are counted, in its own national community of citizens. **The sick
and incapacitated recipient, however, has little or no say in either the
diagnosis or the treatment of the alleged pathology**]{.underline}

### Cybersecurity

#### Calls for increased cybersecurity reinforce the power of the military industrial complex while ceding control of politics to technocratic elites

Cyber-Industrial Complex: A Warning For New US Administration -- OpEd;
Eurasia Review;
https://www.eurasiareview.com/25112020-the-coming-cyber-industrial-complex-a-warning-for-new-us-administration-oped/

Sixty years ago an outgoing, conservative American president warned both
his more liberal successor and his fellow citizens to guard against a
worrying trend he saw emerging during his time in office. President
[Eisenhower's farewell address made infamous the term
"military-industrial complex" as a summation of the rapidly increasing
reliance of a peacetime economy on government contracts to develop
military-grade]{.underline} machines, [weapons]{.underline}, and
information systems. [He worried that the short-term benefits brought on
by increased military investment]{.underline} in the private economy
[could blind public decision-makers and American society to **the
perverse incentives of greater**]{.underline}, even continuous,
**[involvement in violent conflict]{.underline}**. Bidding adieu,
Eisenhower asserted "[the technological revolution during recent
decades" was "akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes
in our industrial-military posture]{.underline}."¶ [Ike's concerns
remain relevant]{.underline} at this moment of transition, but
[in]{.underline} [a new domain]{.underline}.
**[Cybersecurity]{.underline}** -- cyber "defense" -- [presents a
seemingly obvious need in this digital age]{.underline}. As the need for
bigger, more connected, and integrated digital systems rises, so too
will the risks associated with our reliance on those globally
interconnected systems. Responsible governments must develop, promote,
and maintain robust capabilities and sound approaches for deploying
digital weaponry to defend themselves and their citizens from malicious
actors, and they must rely on the aid and leadership of the world's most
innovative companies to do so.¶ [Yet we must ask ourselves what kinds of
cyber creatures we are comfortable introducing into the digital
ecosystem, and whether those are preferable]{.underline} to more
traditional forms of deterrence. [Fear of vulnerabilities and the risks
associated with interconnected networks is understandable,]{.underline}
**[but governments]{.underline}** and industry leaders **[need to take a
longer-term view of the implications new cyber capabilities might hold
for the future digital landscape]{.underline}**.¶ [Such a sustained and
steady increase in cyber defenses has led to creeping calls from
leaders]{.underline} in government and industry [for]{.underline} what
many trendily term [cyber "offense]{.underline}." [Eisenhower might have
predicted that those shouting loudest for the advancement of cyber
offensive capabilities are the same institutions that view these tools
as fundamental to their]{.underline} operational and tactical missions,
as well as their **[budget lines]{.underline}**.¶ It should be clear
that these short-term motivations are entirely logical, but [solutions
to near-term problems should not be our only guides when it comes to
strategic decisions about the cyber-industrial future]{.underline}.¶ [A
truly global cyber war would be more devastating than any traditional
war]{.underline} ever could because it would not be confined to a
physical battlefield. It might literally be waged on the devices in our
pockets. Encouragingly, some thought-leaders are already pushing back on
the race toward cyber "offense," or are calling for a more intentional
balance between the two functions. That said, their arguments are not
necessarily any more tailored to the cyber realm than those they might
normally make to oppose interventionist strikes on land, air, or sea.
[Framing the discussion of cyber "offense" along these familiar lines
loses sight of what Eisenhower called "**the total influence --
economic, political, even spiritual" that peacetime economic dependence
on wartime machinery could hold in**]{.underline} "every city, every
state house, **[every office of the federal government.]{.underline}**"
And, ironically, the very desire to pivot toward increasingly
diversified digital security capabilities may ultimately leave
militaries with fewer tools at their disposal to handle future
conflicts. Cyberwarfare may someday become the best option for ensuring
national security, but it should never become the only option.¶ Lest
this concern be cast as an esoteric matter of federal budgetary
priorities, we should return to Eisenhower's warning that [without
national attention "**public policy could itself become the captive of a
scientific-technological elite**]{.underline}." While eyes may roll at
the thought of a five-star general and two-term president worrying about
the advancement of any too-powerful elite, **[his worries could just as
easily apply to the tools of cyberwarfare as to guns and
bombs.]{.underline}**¶ While [Eisenhower]{.underline} forcefully noted
the necessity of military-funded innovation, he also [reminded us of the
correct order of operations for policy making. We ought to build the
tools we want to ensure the security we need, not settle for the best
security policy for which our tools allow.]{.underline}¶ Geopolitical
strategy aside, [the biggest problem with the enthusiasm for cyber
"offensive" tools to complement those on cyber "defense" is a technical
one]{.underline}. [Words like offense and defense make as much sense in
cyberspace as they do describing the relationship between a plug prong
and an outlet.]{.underline}¶ [Many if not most of the world's most
devastating cyber attacks have been propagated by bad actors who **used
tools initially developed for defensive purposes in offensive
ways.**]{.underline} A standard "[ransomware]{.underline}" attack, for
instance, [involves a bad act]{.underline}or (often depicted wearing a
black or red hat) [using]{.underline} a form of [encryption to steal
data]{.underline} and hold it "ransom" from its rightful owner.
[Encryption in this case is an "offensive" capability, but it is
generally a form of "defense" in most contexts.]{.underline} That is,
encryption is the primary way in which systems prevent data from falling
into the wrong hands. Thus even the simplistic, familiar dichotomy of
"offense versus defense" breaks down in cyberspace, where tools are
perpetually utilized beyond their intended purposes. Indeed, the
internet and computers themselves -- originally military innovations --
are now used to perpetrate more heinous global crimes than any other
tools in existence.¶ [Foraging through other traditional frameworks to
formulate global strategy is similarly unrewarding]{.underline}.
Isolationism versus interventionism, realism versus idealism, and all
the other [lenses through which we might consider national
security]{.underline}, allude to, but [fall short of, a clear framework
for the cyber age]{.underline}. Without picking sides, and more to
illustrate the uselessness of these outmoded spectra, a true cyber
"isolationist" would need a lot of home-grown servers to simply get
through the day, and a cyber "idealist" would make a most juicy target
for any number of phishing or social engineering hacks and scams.¶ And
yet, perhaps the best guide to governing our current acceleration of
cyber capabilities is still the sage advice of a 20th century president
who was born in the 19th. In the same address in which President
Eisenhower cautioned against the influx of military funding into US
manufacturing and academia, he also noted: "[Only an alert and
knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge
industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods
and goals]{.underline}, so that security and liberty may prosper
together."¶ If digital weaponry cannot be so easily classified into the
formal categories of offensive or defensive, good or bad, then we must
begin with labels like "understood," or more simply, "accounted for."
Moreover, [if cyber tools are the world's newest weapons, then cyber
talent is the world's newest]{.underline}, most valuable
[resource]{.underline}. [Only through the education and cultivation
of]{.underline} prepared, informed, and [responsible digital citizens
will the future of cyberspace be the secure, liberated, and prosperous
world so many have fought so hard to make this one]{.underline}.

#### Cyber threats are political tools to increase the money received by cyber companies- the result is a corrupt industry that overhypes security risks

[Do we see the emergence of a cyber security industrial
complex]{.underline}? Is it comparable to the military-industrial
complex that Eisenhower was warning us against during the Cold War?
Should we worry? [Companies providing cyber security services are making
money, as there is a]{.underline}¶ real market **[worth billions of
dollars]{.underline}**. Drawing from older examples, there are¶ some
real concerns that governments may not be getting what they need for¶
the money they spend. For example, the US Government spent \$1 billion
on HP¶ telling the Navy what it did on information architecture overhaul
and system¶ integration. [This is the problem of the revolving
door]{.underline}: [it is difficult to trust the]{.underline}¶
[expertise when people are worrying more about their future job than
about]{.underline}¶ [national interest]{.underline}. [There is also the
apt aphorism about the perfect weapon]{.underline} (for¶ example, the
case the B-1 bomber) [that has 435 parts -- one for each]{.underline}¶
[congressional district]{.underline}. [A third of billboards on the
Washington subway advertise]{.underline}¶ [defence
industries]{.underline}, [including cyber]{.underline} security
[firms]{.underline}.¶ [The ideas of 'Cyber Pearl Harbor' and 'cyber war'
have been around for a while,]{.underline}¶ used or derided by public
figures, **[but they are clearly serving the interests
of]{.underline}**¶ **[cyber security companies]{.underline}**. For
instance, [the private sector]{.underline} is interested in the¶
hack-back capability that a company like Crowdstrike can provide. They
also¶ help them deploy honeynets of their own, assist them in the
intelligence¶ gathering effort in order to find out who exactly is the
attacker. Endgame is¶ probably selling zero-day exploits despite
statements to the contrary; there are¶ a number of countries that are
buying. [Another phenomenon is the porosity]{.underline}¶ [between the
policy-makers' world and the corporate world]{.underline}. [Everyone
sits on]{.underline}¶ [everyone's board]{.underline}. For example,
Richard Perle helped establish Palantir in the¶ intelligence community.
While, speaking of security rackets, Tiversa is a¶ company which scans
P2P networks looking for private files and subsequently¶ offer
protection for these files.¶ On another note, [can we really frame this
issue by declaring 'private good,]{.underline}¶ [public
bad']{.underline} -- 'innovativeness and efficiency vs. capture and
waste'? There can¶ always be the argument in favour of 'blue skies'
research that might find an¶ immediate application, but some innovations
are generated by the cyber¶ security industry. However, can this be
sustainable without massive investment?¶ Brand names are established and
it is very hard to enter the market. There have¶ been large-scale IT
transformations with mergers, and large corporations can be¶ as bad as
public sector.¶ **[The cyber security industry is a bonanza for arms
producers]{.underline}**. In Europe,¶ [traditional security companies
are expanding into the cyber security market via]{.underline}¶
[acquisitions and partnerships]{.underline} (e.g. BAE and Detica).
[States are investing in cyber]{.underline}¶ [security and companies are
making use of their long-term good relationship]{.underline}¶ [with
states]{.underline}. The defence market is characterised as a monopsony
and oligopoly,¶ and the Iron Triangle is also at work here. Critical
information infrastructures¶ are largely privately owned and states do
not have the capabilities to protect¶ them.¶ **[The arms market and the
cyber security market have several common features]{.underline}**:¶
security is a public good; there is a need for trust between the
government and¶ the companies providing security; **[fear is often used
as a legitimation of public]{.underline}**¶ **[security
policies;]{.underline}** and there is an interest in sophisticated tools
for both attack¶ and defence. But there are also differences: cyber
security is usually not about¶ violence; the structure and composition
of the markets are drastically different;¶ and states have to work with
the wider ICT industry to make their products safer¶ by design, rather
than only with security companies to fix the problems.

#### US dominance over the digital ecosystem ushers in a new form of colonialism over the global South

This paper argues that an insidious new phenomenon, [digital
colonialism, casts a shadow on the Global South]{.underline}.3 Digital
colonialism is [a structural form of domination exercised through
the]{.underline} centralized ownership and [control of]{.underline} the
three core pillars of [the digital ecosystem: software, hardware, and
network connectivity]{.underline}. As we will see, [control of these
pillars vests the United States with immense political, economic, and
social power]{.underline}. As such, [GAFAM
(]{.underline}Google/Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft)
and other corporate giants -- [as well as state intelligence
agencies]{.underline} like the National Security Agency (NSA) -- [are
the New Imperialists in the international community. Assimilation into
the tech products, models, and ideologies of foreign powers -- led by
the United States -- constitutes a 21st century form of
colonization]{.underline}. The present structure of the tech ecosystem
is not written in the stars. [There are alternative]{.underline}
technologies, models, and [ideologies for constructing a digital society
aligned with human rights, democracy, and socioeconomic justice.
Decentralized ownership and control of software, hardware, and the
Internet are necessary prerequisites]{.underline} in this endeavor.
[Activists, technologists, and intellectuals]{.underline} in the global
Free Software community have been at the forefront of this movement, and
they [have developed some of the alternative technologies that can be
used today]{.underline}. This paper proposes a theoretical and
conceptual framework for assessing digital colonialism, drawing on South
Africa as a case example. In doing so, it makes three contributions to
scholarship: (1) it theorizes [digital colonialism as rooted in control
over the digital ecosystem]{.underline}, (2) it provides a conceptual
framework for digital domination in the Global South, and (3) it
recommends practical alternatives that societies can pursue.4 Section I
of this paper briefly outlines the social context in South Africa. It
then highlights similarities with classic colonialism to demonstrate how
imposition of the Northern digital ecosystem constitutes digital
colonialism. It outlines how [the United States exercises economic
domination through corporate colonization, imposes imperial control
through architectural domination, casts the shadow of global
surveillance capitalism over the world, and is expanding imperial state
surveillance]{.underline}. Section II proposes a theory of a
freedom-respecting digital ecosystem -- People's Technology for People's
Power, or People's Technology for short -- as a necessary antidote to
digital capitalism. It discusses different models of infrastructural
ownership and control over software, hardware, and the Internet. By
contrasting the present ecosystem to People's Technology, it details how
[the United States consolidates tech hegemony through ruling class
conceptions of technological progress -- a doctrine of Manifest Destiny
for the digital age.]{.underline} The paper concludes that digital
colonialism threatens the Global South, and recommends solutions
consistent with human rights, liberty, and equality.

[Today]{.underline}, a new form of corporate colonization is taking
place. Instead of the conquest of land[, Big Tech corporations are
colonizing digital technology]{.underline}. The following functions are
all dominated by a handful of US multinationals: search engines
(Google); web browsers (Google Chrome); smartphone and tablet operating
systems (Google Android, Apple iOS); desktop and laptop operating
systems (Microsoft Windows); office software (Microsoft Office, Google
Docs); cloud infrastructure and services (Amazon, Microsoft, Google,
IBM); social networking platforms (Facebook, Twitter); transportation
(Uber, Lyft); business networking (Microsoft LinkedIn); streaming video
(Google YouTube, Netflix, Hulu); and online advertising (Google,
Facebook) -- among others. GAFAM now comprise the five wealthiest
corporations in the world, with a combined market cap exceeding \$3
trillion.10 [If South Africans integrate Big Tech products into their
society, the United States will obtain enormous power over their economy
and create technological dependencies that will lead to perpetual
resource extraction]{.underline}. As an empirical matter, this point has
been understudied. Nevertheless, [early research and anecdotes suggest
the economic impact of Big Tech intermediaries is detrimental to local
African industries. Murphy, Carmody, and Surborg]{.underline} studied
the role of ICTs among small, medium, and microsized enterprises (SMMEs)
in South Africa's and Tanzania's wood and tourism industries. They
[found that ICTs introduced the dominance of information
intermediaries]{.underline}. Increased use of ICTs also led to greater
worker surveillance in some instances. They concluded that ICT
integration is, on balance, benefiting foreign-owned businesses and
corporations.1 [Similar conclusions can be derived from press accounts
of the transportation industry. Since Uber began operating in
Johannesburg in 2013, there have been labor strikes and violent clashes
in the "South African taxi wars".]{.underline} Several e-hailing taxi
murders have been carried out by metered taxi drivers, who have warned
that Uber will "burn" if it remains in South Africa. At the same time,
many Uber drivers endure onerous working conditions for low pay.12 Uber
has had devastating effects in Africa and beyond.13 [The company takes
around 25% commission for each trip, in addition to hidden
costs,]{.underline}14 [leading to an outflow of revenue from the local
economy to foreign coffers. Moreover, they]{.underline} are able to
[undercut local markets by offering artificially low prices: Uber can
operate at a loss -- to the tune of billions -- thanks to funding from
Wall Street and other wealthy investors.15 With the backing of corporate
finance, it leverages predatory subsidies, network effects, Big Data
analytics, and the deregulatory effects of its position as an
"intermediary" to stamp out competition and colonize the
market]{.underline}. Within just two years, Uber sported a net worth of
R1.65 billion (\~\$125 million) inside SA.16[Similar problems have
emerged in the media]{.underline}. In April 2017, the online news outlet
GroundUp dropped Google Ads from its website. GroundUp's Nathan Geffen
explains the Google advertising model is "broken" for publishers who
"have to put up with poor quality, misleading adverts in exchange for
small change." "The problem," Geffen says, "is that [nearly all the
power in the online advertising relationship lies with
Google."]{.underline} The ad giant also serves up censorship threats: in
one example, Google issued a warning to GroundUp for publishing a
picture containing a painted bare breast as part of a protest action.17
In November 2017, Financial Mail's Anton Harber wrote a feature story
deeming Google and Facebook "the biggest threat to South African news
media".18 [Google takes 70% of local online advertising,
while]{.underline} social media -- led by [Facebook -- takes another
12%.]{.underline} The major SA media groups are left with just 8% of the
pie. The [Google and Facebook]{.underline} "nemesis" are an expanding
duopoloy: they [take 77% of online advertising spend in the US and
captured virtually all the ad growth in 2016]{.underline}.19 [If this
continues, Harber exclaims, "the big two could have a devastating effect
on the media's role in defining democracy]{.underline}".20 [These early
case examples]{.underline} -- the thin integration of ICTs into the wood
and tourism industries in South Africa and Tanzania, Uber colonization
of taxi markets, and the rising dominance of Google and Facebook in
South African media -- [provide clear instances of digital colonialism
whereby foreign corporations undermine local development, dominate the
market, and extract revenue from the Global South]{.underline}. As we
see next, this power is obtained primarily through the structural
domination of digital architecture, which leads to more general forms of
imperial control.

#### US control of digital infrastructure locks in a new imperial relationship that extracts value from the global South

Under digital colonialism[, foreign powers, led by the United States,
are planting infrastructure in the Global South engineered for its own
needs, enabling economic and cultural domination while imposing
privatized forms of governance.]{.underline} To accomplish this task,
[major corporations design digital technology to ensure their own
dominance over critical functions in the tech ecosystem]{.underline}.
This allows them [to accumulate profits from revenues derived from
rent]{.underline} (in the form of intellectual property or access to
infrastructure) [and surveillance]{.underline} (in the form of Big
Data). [It also empowers them to exercise control over the flow of
information]{.underline} (such as the distribution of news and streaming
services), social activities (like social networking and cultural
exchange), [and a plethora of other political, social, economic, and
military functions]{.underline} mediated by their technologies. The
control of code is foundational to digital domination. In Code: And
Other Laws of Cyberspace, Lawrence Lessig (1999/2006) famously argued
that computer code shapes the rules, norms, and behaviors of
computer-mediated experiences in ways similar to architecture in
physical space (e.g. imperial railways designed for colonization).23 As
a result, "code is law" in the sense that it has the power to usurp
legal, institutional, and social norms impacting the political,
economic, and cultural domains of society. This critical insight has
been applied in fields like copyright, free speech regulation, Internet
governance, blockchain, privacy, and even torts. What has been missed,
however, is how [US dominance of code -- and other forms of digital
architecture -- usurps sovereignty in foreign countries. The power of
the United States over code and other digital infrastructure constitutes
a new form of imperialism. Digital forms of power]{.underline} are
linked together through the three core pillars of the digital ecosystem:
[software, hardware, and network connectivity.]{.underline}24 Software
is the set of instructions that define and determine what your computer
can do. Hardware is the physical equipment used for computer
experiences. The network is the set of protocols and standards computers
use to talk to each other, and the connections they make. Domination
over these three elements -- software, hardware, and networks --
provides a great source of power over people. Let us consider each in
turn. Software is the coded logic that constrains and enables particular
user experiences. For example, software determines rules and policies
such as whether or not users can post a message anonymously at a
website, or whether or not users can make a copy of a
copyright-restricted file like an e-book. The rules that a programmer
codes into the software largely determines technological freedoms and
shapes users' experiences using their devices. Thus[, software exerts a
powerful influence on the behavior, policies, and freedoms of people
using digital technology. Control over software is a source of digital
domination primarily exercised through software licenses and hardware
ownership]{.underline}. Free Software licenses allow people to use,
study, modify, and share software as they see fit.25 By contrast,
non-free software licenses grant a software designer control over users
by precluding the ability to exercise those freedoms. With proprietary
software, the humanreadable source code is closed off to the public, and
owners usually restrict the ability to use the software without paying.
In the case of Microsoft Windows, for example, the public must pay for
the program in order to use it, they cannot read the source code to
understand how it works, they cannot change its behavior by changing the
code, and they cannot share a copy with others. Thus with proprietary
licensing, Microsoft maintains absolute control over how the software
works. The same goes for other proprietary apps, like Google Play or
Adobe Photoshop.26 By design[, non-free software]{.underline} provides
the owner power over the user experience. It [is
authoritarian]{.underline} software. [Control over hardware is a second
source of digital domination]{.underline}. This can take at least three
forms: software run on third-party servers, centralized ownership of
hardware, or hardware designed to prevent users from changing the
software. Let us consider each of these in turn. In the first instance,
software is executed on someone else's computer. As a result, users are
dispossessed of their ability to control it. This is typically
accomplished through Software as a Service (SaaS) in the cloud. For
example, when you visit the Facebook website, the interface you are
provided executes on third party hardware (i.e. on Facebook's cloud
servers). Because users cannot change the code running on Facebook's
servers, they cannot get rid of the "like" button or change the Facebook
experience. "There is no cloud," the saying goes, "just someone else's
computer." [Corporations and other third parties design cloud services
for remote control over the user experience. This gives them immense
power over individuals, groups, and society]{.underline}.27 In the
second instance, [people become dispossessed of hardware ownership
itself. With the rise of cloud computing]{.underline}, it is possible
that hardware manufacturers will soon only offer low-powered, lowmemory
devices (similar to the terminals of the 1960s and 1970s) and [computer
processing and data storage will be primarily conducted in centralized
clouds. With end-users dispossessed of processing power and storage,
software and data would be under the absolute control of the owners and
operators of clouds]{.underline}.28 In the third instance, [hardware is
manufactured with locks that prevent users from changing the software on
the devices]{.underline}. By locking down devices to a pre-determined
set of software choices, the hardware manufacturer determines which
software is allowed to run when you turn on your device.29 Thus,
[hardware restrictions can prevent the public from controlling their
devices, granting device manufacturers them power over users. Control
over network connectivity is a third source of digital
domination]{.underline}. Net neutrality regulation proposes that
Internet traffic should be "neutral" so that Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) treat content flowing through their cables, cellular towers, and
satellites equally. According this philosophy, those who own the pipes
are "common carriers" and should almost never be allowed to manipulate
the data that flows through them.30 This constrains the ability of
wealthy media providers to pay for faster content delivery speeds than
less wealthy providers (such as grassroots organizations, small
businesses, and common people). More importantly, by treating traffic
equally, net neutrality prevents network discrimination against various
forms of traffic critical to civil rights and liberties. For example,
the Tor browser facilitates anonymous Internet communications, but the
use of the Tor network can be detected by Internet Service Providers and
throttled (i.e. slowed to a crawl).31 Net neutrality prevents this form
of discrimination and protects the end user's freedom to utilize the
Internet as they wish, without third party favoritism, blocking, or
throttling. Each of the three pillars of the digital ecosystem --
software, hardware, and network -- constitute a source of power and
control. To illustrate the point, let us consider some concrete examples
related to social justice in the Global South. The copyright industry is
threatened by the mass sharing of paywalled publications over the
Internet (what they derisively label "piracy"). Given that hard drive
capacity and Internet speeds will rapidly increase over time, the
capacity to share vast libraries of music, movies, books, and other
media is steadily increasing. What will be done when each person has a
40 terabyte hard drive and can trade the entire collection of popular
music from the last century within an hour? Advances in technology
deepen the need for architectural control to police the copyright
system. One way to stop file sharing is to control software. The
industry built Digital Rights Management (DRM) software, for example, to
prevent copyright-restricted publications from playing on a user's
computer unless the user pays to access it first. This works well with
proprietary software because people cannot remove the DRM. However, if
the DRM software is Free Software -- which allows people the freedom to
use, study, modify, and share the software -- people can remove the DRM
code that locks the content. Thus, industry is bolstered by proprietary
software as a means to enforce copyright. A second way to prevent
sharing is to take control of the hardware. If, for example, people stop
running software on their own devices -- and instead run their computer
experiences through centralized cloud servers -- then cloud providers
can determine their "access" to copyrighted data. In this scenario,
users cannot copy and trade media over the Internet because the data
"streams" to their device from a content owner's platform (e.g. Netflix
or Spotify) which provides media content through their servers. Thus,
the widespread distribution of storage capacity and broadband Internet
threatens the copyright monopoly.32 A third way to prevent sharing media
is to control the network. People may own and control their software and
hardware, but if they can be spied on by an ISP or government, then they
can be fined or arrested for copyright infringement, or have their
Internet connection throttled or terminated. People might use privacy
protection technologies to conceal their content sharing -- such as the
Tor network or Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) -- but this can be
thwarted by ISPs throttling Tor or VPNs. In this scenario, control of
the network (ISP discrimination) is used to make anonymous content
sharing impractical. Thus, public control of the network threatens
copyright enforcement. To bring this back to colonialism, [US
multinationals have designed digital architecture which, in one way or
another, allows them to accumulate vast fortunes based on rent or data
extraction]{.underline}. In the case of copyright, control over
software, hardware, or the Internet is used to protect the copyright
monopoly in the name of intellectual property rights. Given that the
marginal cost of producing digital works is near-zero, prominent
intellectuals have challenged copyright paywalls in the interest of
socioeconomic justice and out of concern that draconian technologies are
needed to enforce digital forms of copyright.33 [Free access to digital
publications for all people on planet earth, irrespective oftheir
wealth, could improve education, culture, equality, democracy, and
innovation. Western technology has been engineered to block free
sharing, which impoverishes poor people's ability to obtain knowledge
and culture and reduces communication between rich and poor. Facebook's
Free Basics service]{.underline} offers another case example of how Big
Tech corporations expand empire in the Global South. Free Basics offers
a stripped-down version of free Internet services to people with little
or no disposable income. Facebook [decides which content and websites
the poor can access]{.underline} -- while of course offering Facebook
itself within the app. Free Basics is zero-rated by ISPs, meaning that
data transfers inside the app are paid for by ISPs instead of their
customers. The ISPs hope that the limited Internet experience will lead
to paying customers who, having tasted a free sample, will purchase data
for the full experience. [Free Basics not only has Facebook playing
Internet gatekeeper of the poor, it also violates net neutrality laws:
zero-rated offerings place content providers on unequal footing. Several
countries have terminated Free Basics]{.underline}, in part due to
popular backlash.34 However, Internet.org has put over 100 million users
from over 60 countries -- including South Africa -- into the Facebook
platform, which channels them towards the Facebook ecosystem[.
Integrating platforms like Facebook outside the US]{.underline} does
more than drain local advertising revenue: it [undermines various forms
of local governance.]{.underline} Seventy-five percent of web
publisher's traffic now comes from [Google]{.underline} (46%) [and
Facebook]{.underline} (29%).35 Centralization of services into their
hands provides them with centralized control over communications -- by
way of code. These two firms filter [search results and news feeds with
proprietary black box algorithms, granting them enormous power to shape
who sees which news. Leftist outlets have published data suggesting that
Google censors socialist views, while Facebook has been found to favor
mainstream liberal media.36 Platforms also regulate freedom of speech
and association]{.underline}.37 If an online social network detects
certain keywords and forms of speech, [they can censor it, or ban the
user]{.underline}. Moreover, [they can prohibit the right to associate
with others in the pursuit of social, political, economic, cultural, and
religious ends. This has been carried out against
Palestinians]{.underline} (e.g. with the removal of the page for the
political party, Fatah), as well as the far-right.38 [As private
overlords of critical information infrastructure, US multinationals have
the power to regulate the press, speech, and association in foreign
territorie]{.underline}s, as they see fit. These examples demonstrate
how [structural domination of the tech ecosystem undermines local
sovereignty through privatized forms of political, economic, and social
governance. This helps the US perpetuate copyright paywalls, control
information flows, spread their platform monopolies, supplant local
autonomy, filter communications, and deepen dependency on the
US.]{.underline} In turn, corporations increasingly profit from Big Data
surveillance, an exploitative human rights transgression against the
Global South. We discuss this element next.

Today, [the United States is at the center of a new, digital global
surveillance apparatus.]{.underline} U.S. whistleblowers like William
Binney, Thomas Drake, Kirk Wiebe, and Ed Lumis revealed that the U.S.
government is conducting bulk surveillance on foreign and domestic
populations. Their claims were confirmed by Edward Snowden, who leaked a
massive trove of documents to journalists in June 2013. Various leaks
and whistleblowers have revealed that [the United States government
partners with major U.S.-based technology corporations to conduct mass
surveillance on domestic and global populations]{.underline}. The
National Security Agency (NSA) is at the center of the new surveillance
regime (Greenwald, 2014; Granick, 2017). The vast scope of [NSA
surveillance is]{.underline} indicated by various programs disclosed by
whistleblowers. The two primary tools used to conduct surveillance are
Upstream (which taps the Internet backbone, often with direct
cooperation from U.S. corporations) and PRISM (which gives the NSA
access to data from major corporate service providers such as Facebook,
Google, Microsoft, and Skype) (Macaskill and Dance, 2013). A program
called XKEYSCORE is [used to collect "nearly everything a user does on
the Internet" and provide them with a Google-like search interface for
surveillance targets]{.underline} (Greenwald, 2013; Dorling, 2013).
Through BULLRUN, the NSA inserted vulnerabilities into popular protocols
like HTTPS, voice-over-IP, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) (Ball, et al.,
2013) \[29\]. The NSA permits it to store any and all encrypted
communications for as long as they wish, in hopes they may one day
decrypt the content (Perloth, et al., 2013). The NSA's new \$2 billion
facility in Bluffdale, Utah has four 25,000-square-foot data halls to
store "rows and rows" of servers (Bamford, 2012). According to NSA
whistleblower William Binney, Bluffdale was built to expand the NSA's
data storage capacity. He estimates "just for e-mails and phone calls
alone they have approaching 20 trillion transactions of US citizens with
other US citizens" (Binney, 2013). Banking, social networking data, and
other services add trillions of more transactions. The mass interception
and collection of electronic communications demonstrates that the United
States and its allies aim to bring nearly all electronic communications
under its vast global surveillance net. [There are recent examples of
Western intelligence agencies spying on South Africans]{.underline}. In
June 2014, the Washington Post reported that the [NSA provided legal
certification "to intercept through U.S. companies not just the
communications of its overseas targets but any communications about its
targets as well]{.underline}" (Nakashima and Gellman, 2014). [One
hundred ninety three countries are certified targets]{.underline},
including South Africa (Washington Post, 2014). In 2014, Der Spiegel
published slides detailing an [NSA]{.underline} program, TREASUREMAP,
which [aims to provide a "near real-time, interactive map of the global
internet]{.underline}" that plots every device connected in "a kind of
Google Earth for global data traffic, a bird's eye view of the planet's
digital arteries" (Müller-Maguhn, et al., 2014). The NSA includes South
Africa among its "13 covered servers in unwitting data centers around
the globe" (National Security Agency \[NSA\], n.d.). The data centers
help the NSA "perform \[DNS\] monitoring covertly and to get a more
global view on DNS name resolution and service availability" \[30\]. In
2016, Le Monde reported that Britain's Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ), an NSA ally, tapped into telecommunications
networks by targeting their managers. South Africa-based
telecommunications corporation MTN Group was among those under
surveillance (Leloup and Utersinger, 2016). The GCHQ also aimed to
retrieve the briefings of the South African delegates to G20 and G8
summit meetings (Guardian, 2013). In 2015, the United Kingdom
Investigatory Powers Tribunal found the GCHQ unlawfully breached the
European Convention on Human Rights for spying on the South
African-based Legal Resources Centre (LRC) (RDM Newswire, 2015). The LRC
is known for its work protecting human rights. Within South Africa there
is suspicion that domestic corporations and the state are conducting
bulk surveillance. In 2011, Wikileaks published leaked documents from
Stellenbosch-based VASTech SA Pty Ltd. showcasing equipment for bulk
communications interception. The content of phone calls and e-mail
messages, as well as metadata from telephone and Internet
communications, can be swept up by VASTech's Zebra, Badger, and
Satellite Signal Analyser products (Swart, 2016a). The equipment was
sold to Muammar Gaddafi, who used it for bulk surveillance of the Libyan
population (Sonne and Coker, 2011). In October 2016, The Intercept
published a leaked document revealing that VASTech has since developed
more powerful "NSA-like" equipment it claims "rivals a government spy
agency" (McLaughlin, 2016). During the mid-2000s, VASTech was subsidized
by the South African government (Mchunu, 2013). It is not known if the
government owns or uses VASTech's mass surveillance equipment. However,
the evidence suggests it desires to conduct bulk surveillance to counter
political dissent. In June 2016, investigative journalist Heidi Swart
reported contents of a leaked document, "The 2014 National Intelligence
Priorities". According to Swart, "The document states that countering
the 'most serious threats to our national security' that require
'immediate and sustained intelligence collection" involves the 'maximum
use of covert human and technical means'.' The "intelligence gathering
is justified by several 'threats to national security'. For example, one
intelligence priority for 2014 centered on national and provincial
elections. The SSA Domestic Branch was tasked with investigating and
counterplanning for a 'so-called "Arab Spring" uprising prior to
elections'". "Another area of interest for the SAA," Swart added, "was
investigating and counterplanning for 'violent industrial action', with
the investigation of 'inter-union rivalry as a driver of violent
industrial action' high on the agenda. The transport industry was to be
watched to allow for 'counterplanning for violence in the taxi
industry'". Areas of surveillance include "terrorism, espionage,
violence against foreign nationals, gangsterism, and the private
security industry" (Swart, 2016b). Privacy advocates consider South
African communications legislation too weak to adequately safeguard
privacy (Right2Know, 2014). Under the Regulation of Interception of
Communications and Provision Act (RICA), telecommunications service
providers must deploy infrastructure to allow the monitoring and
interception of communications, while Internet service providers are
required to store citizen metadata for three--five years. Legislation
fails to regulate the most powerful mass surveillance capabilities
conducted at the National Communications Centre, and citizens are
required to register SIM cards in a national database (Right2Know,
2016). The "2014 National Priorities" document and other facts about
surveillance equipment and legislation make clear that all South African
inhabitants face the threat of mass government surveillance. [As digital
technology spreads]{.underline} in South Africa, its inhabitants must
also grapple with ubiquitous surveillance captured for big data
analytics via the private sector. There are warning signs that [this
will have deleterious effects on civil rights and
liberties.]{.underline} In May 2016, Angwin, et al. published a case
study for ProPublica in which the Correctional Offender Management
Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) [computer software created
by Northpointe corporation for the U.S. criminal justice system assigned
a higher criminal "risk assessment" to blacks than to
whites]{.underline}. ProPublica's study assessed 7,000 people arrested
in Florida. They found the risk assessment algorithm used to predict
violent crime flagged black defendants as future criminals at twice the
rate as white defendants. Northpointe's algorithm is proprietary. As
such, there is no way for the public to understand how it gave rise to
this outcome. However, some details were provided to ProPublica.
[Northpointe does not categorize individuals by race, but they do assess
factors correlated to race, such as educational degree and employment
status.]{.underline} Northpointe's founder, Tim Brennan, maintains that
categories correlated to race like poverty, joblessness, and social
marginalization must be included lest "your \... accuracy goes down"
(Angwin, et al., 2016). Their predictive policing software is among the
most widely used assessment tools in the U.S. criminal justice system.
[Commercial surveillance also threatens to reinforce socioeconomic
inequality.]{.underline} For example, [companies are seeking to exploit
novel forms of data to determine credit scores]{.underline}. Social
networking services like Facebook seek to determine creditworthiness
based on "social credit scores" (data from social networking) (Packin
and Lev-Aretz, 2016). A person's Facebook friends, for example, might
better indicate her creditworthiness than her financial history derived
from a FICO score. As with Northpointe's algorithm, facially neutral
categories might adversely affect oppressed groups. In the case of
race[, if having personal wealth and wealthy friends raises your credit
score, and white people have more wealth, then the algorithm would favor
whites and reinforce race-based inequality]{.underline} \[31\].
Socioeconomic inequality is all the more prone to insidious
reinforcement when race-associated attributes tacitly emerge through
data analytics. This is sometimes called "latent trait inference"
whereby algorithmic processes are able to accurately infer traits from
data even if they are not disclosed. Facebook has been dancing around
this issue. For example, their users do not disclose their race (there
is no "race" category), but Facebook offers advertisers "ethnic
affinity" categories such as African American, Asian American, and
Hispanic. Given that any user from any "race" can fall into the category
based on "indicators" (e.g., a white person who is a member of the
African American Chamber of Commerce will help define their "ethnic
affinity"), Facebook states they are not racially profiling (Newtiz,
2016). In March 2016, Business Insider revealed [different users
received different trailers for the film Straight Outta Compton based on
their Facebook affinity group]{.underline} (McAlone, 2016). There were
two different Straight Outta Compton trailers delivered to the affinity
groups. [The trailer shown to white people boxed into their own ethnic
affinity group portrayed the film as a "gangster movie" full of violence
and conflicts with police. The trailer shown to black people pegged into
their respective affinity group portrayed the film as a biopic, with
violence contextualized as "'protest' imagery created by the very
relatable, beloved members of N.W.A."]{.underline} (Newitz, 2016). In
another instance, Facebook was sued by its users over "over alleged
discriminatory policies that they say violate the US Federal Housing Act
of 1964" (Farivar, 2016). The ethnic affinity grouping allowed marketers
to offer housing advertisements that exclude ethnic affinity groups
(Angwin and Parris, Jr., 2016) \[32\]. Under apartheid, the South
African Broadcasting Corporation [(SABC) also provided different media
content for its official race categories. Channel TV1 was reserved for
whites and TV2/3 was reserved for blacks]{.underline}. Their language
policy called for "culturally authentic communication" \[33\]. English
terms like "potato chips" and "toothpaste" were prohibited by TV2/3.
There were no corresponding terms in Zulu, Xhosa, or Tswana, so
advertisers were forced to describe them as "slice of potato fried in
oil" or "the soap that cleans your teeth" \[34\]. [Separate media
content was designed to reinforce racial segregation. While big data
content delivery does not filter as sharply, discriminatory content
delivery via filter bubbles threatens to segregate cultural groups, with
adverse effects on oppressed groups and social cohesion]{.underline}.
[The poor black majority thus has many reasons to worry about government
and commercial surveillance. When asked about collection of student
data, a high level e-education official, Sipho\* said, "There are a lot
of contentious problems. It's very much linked the right to privacy of
individuals and so forth]{.underline}". When asked about the fact that
Google and the United States government will be tracking the youth from
a young age, Sipho responded that "we are not having such a discussion
at the moment" \[35\].

The [collection and circulation of data is now a central element of
increasingly more sectors of contemporary capitalism]{.underline}. This
article analyses data as a form of capital that is distinct from, but
has its roots in, economic capital. [Data collection is driven by the
perpetual cycle of capital accumulation, which in turn drives capital to
construct and rely upon a universe in which everything is made of
data.]{.underline} [The imperative to capture all data, from all
sources, by any means possible influences many key decisions about
business models, political governance, and technological
development.]{.underline} This article argues that many common practices
[of data accumulation should actually be understood in terms of data
extraction,]{.underline} wherein data is taken with little regard for
consent and compensation. By understanding data as a form capital, we
can better analyse the meaning, practices, and implications of
datafication as a political economic regime. Data has become central and
essential for increasingly more sectors of contemporary capitalism.
[Industries focused on technology, infrastructure, finance,
manufacturing, insurance, and energy are now treating data as a form of
capital.]{.underline} No longer is data just a concern of scientists or
a by-product of other processes. [Until recently, companies]{.underline}
simply [deleted data or chose not to collect it because paying for
storage did not seem like a good investmen]{.underline}t (Oracle and MIT
Technology Review Custom, 2016). [Now]{.underline}, though[, companies
are clamouring to collect data]{.underline} -- as much as they can,
wherever they can. For the increasing number of companies participating
in the 'data economy' or 'digital economy,' deleting data because of
storage costs would be like burning piles of money or dumping barrels of
oil down the drain because renting a warehouse was too much trouble.
[While data is not the same as profit, they share a similar
logic.]{.underline} [Just as we expect corporations to be profit-driven,
we should now expect organisations to be data-driven;]{.underline} that
is, the drive to accumulate data now propels new ways of doing business
and governance. It is a key factor in major corporate decisions, such as
Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods for \$13.7 billion (Stevens and
Haddon, 2017), and of government policies such as investment in urban
sensor networks (Heinzmann, 2014). Indeed, as The Economist (2017b) has
noted, 'Industrial giants such as GE and Siemens now sell themselves as
data firms.' In short, [data -- and the accumulation of data -- is a
core component of political economy in the 21st century.]{.underline}
[As a]{.underline} paradigm and [logic, the idea of data-as-capital
affects and transforms many spaces and sectors]{.underline}. Thanks to
[technologies like the Internet]{.underline} of Things, online
platforms, and data analytics the list of things that [now count as
'digital products and services' -- and hence what counts as part of the
digital economy]{.underline} -- is growing at a rapid pace (Srnicek,
2016). [This]{.underline}, in turn, [means]{.underline} that [data is a
foundational form of capital for everything]{.underline} from the 'smart
home' to the 'smart city,' finance to governance, production to
distribution, consumer devices to enterprise systems, and much more
(Kitchin, 2014). [Without data, many of these technologies and
organisations would not be able to operate,]{.underline} let alone be
able to generate value. This article contributes to the study of data
within contemporary capitalism by analysing data as a form of capital.
The [existing literature on the social, political and economic
dimensions of data treats data as a commodity]{.underline}. Whether
implicitly or explicitly, analyses in both academic and media outlets
typically take this analytical frame as a given. Yet, as this article
makes clear, [the distinction between capital and commodity is important
and we cannot assume data is always a commodity]{.underline}. By
[understanding data as a form of capital, we can better analyse the
nature and dynamics of digital capitalism]{.underline}. Rather than data
collection being seen as simply a way of producing and obtaining
commodities that are somehow converted into monetary value, datafication
takes shape as a political economic regime driven by the logic of
perpetual (data) capital accumulation and circulation. Framing data as a
form of capital casts new light on the imperatives motivating
contemporary organisations, the ways value can be derived from data, and
the normative importance of data extraction. There are now a variety of
labels that refer to the political economic relationship between data
and capitalism, such as 'surveillance capitalism' (Foster and McChesney,
2014; Zuboff, 2015), 'informational capitalism' (Fuchs, 2010),
'communicative capitalism' (Dean, 2005), 'platform capitalism' (Srnicek,
2016) and 'iCapitalism' (Duff, 2016). These different labels are not
interchangeable, but they do share common themes and conclusions. This
paper builds on three broad insights from the growing literature on
critical political economy of data: (1) data is valuable and
value-creating (Arvidsson, 2016; Roderick, 2014; Srnicek, 2016); (2)
[data collection has a pervasive, powerful influence over how businesses
and governments behave]{.underline} (Bouk, forthcoming; Fourcade and
Healy, 2017; Zuboff, 2016); and (3) [data systems are rife with
relations of inequity, extraction, and exploitation]{.underline}
(Aitken, 2017; Andrejevic, 2014; Fourcade and Healy, 2013; Poon, 2016;
Thatcher et al., 2016). Fourcade and Healy (2017) have argued [that
'modern organisations' are now driven by a 'data imperative' that
demands the extraction of all data, from all sources]{.underline}, by
any means possible. 'Storing and studying people\'s everyday activities,
even the seemingly mundane, has become the default rather than the
exception' (Angwin and Valentino-Devries, 2012: n.p.). Fulfilling the
data imperative involves more than just passively collecting data; it
means actively creating data (IBM, 2014). This entails the (total)
datafication and surveillance of people, places, processes, things, and
relationships among them (van Dijck, 2014). Cisco, one of the companies
building this all-encompassing system, calls it 'the Internet of
Everything.' Similarly, IBM states that, 'Everything is made of data
these days' (IBM, 2014). What does it mean to see the world in a way
that asserts everything is data? This is not just a neutral observation
about the nature or substance of the world. Such statements do not
merely reveal or reflect the world. They order and construct the world
(Boyd and Crawford, 2012; Kitchin et al., 2015). By operating
rhetorically (Rosenberg, 2013), [they change how we understand and
interact with the world, and they put those with data capital in a
position of access and authority.]{.underline} They establish the
context through [which accumulation and use of data not only occurs, but
becomes a driving logic that influences behaviour]{.underline}. They
perform the power/knowledge relationship: to know the world is to
exercise power over it and to exercise power is to know it -- to examine
its features and characteristics, to sort it into categories and norms,
to render it legible and observable, to exclude other metrics and
methods of knowing it (Bowker and Star, 2000). Data mining is a
misleading name; a more apt term would be data manufacturing. Data is
not out there waiting to be discovered as if it already exists in the
world like crude oil and raw ore (Gitelman, 2013). Data is a recorded
abstraction of the world created and valorised by people using
technology. The framing of data as a natural resource that is everywhere
and free for the taking reinforces regimes of data accumulation. A 2014
video by Siemens, a major industrial manufacturer, illustrates the logic
of the data imperative: 'We live in a universe of data that gains not
only in volume, but importance, every day. The question of how to
generate business value from it becomes more and more essential to us.
We need to understand that data is everywhere, and it is generated every
second of the day. We need to understand data as an asset -- and turn it
into a value.' (2014) It is not a coincidence that data is treated as a
universal substance right at the time when there is so much to gain for
whoever can lay claim to that data and extract it from every source.
Indeed, there is a feedback loop: many control systems rely on the
constant gathering and processing of data, and in turn those control
systems enable more data to be generated (Sadowski and Pasquale, 2015).
[Flows of data correspond to flows of power and profit, thus the alchemy
of datafication promises to produce infinite reserves of
both.]{.underline} At the same time, the rhetoric of universality
reframes everything as within the domain of
surveillance/platform/digital capitalism. The goal of transforming
everything into data and the search for new sources of data echoes
imperialist modes of accumulation (Luxemburg, 1951; Thatcher et al.,
2016). In short, as capitalism faces crises of accumulation, there is a
need to find new sources of value and new places to offload goods. 'Old
strategies of accumulation are re-attempted in new spaces and new
strategies are crafted through trial and error in the never-ending quest
to surpass or displace the internal contradictions which lead to crisis'
(Greene and Joseph, 2015: 224). This could mean subjecting previously
non-commodified and non-monetised parts of life to the logic of
capitalism or colonising new territories so they are brought into the
global capitalist web as sites of extraction (Moore, 2015). We can see
this dynamic of 'data colonialism' when technology corporations like
Facebook and Google move into territories like India and Africa
(Thatcher et al., 2016). They do so under the guise of providing
subsidised services that connect marginalised people to the Internet,
yet the companies also benefit greatly by opening markets, locking
people into their platforms, and tapping sources of data (Solon, 2017).
These new places with new people provide new opportunities for data
accumulation. The same imperialist tactics are being replayed now, but
updated for the digital age. As we can see, this growing body of
research on critical data studies (Dalton et al., 2016) has shown how
the production, distribution, and use of data is situated within an
emerging political economy that has wide-ranging implications across
society: from the restructuring of cities and the state (Kitchin et al.,
2015; Leszczynski, 2012), to the (re)development of electrical and
computational infrastructure (Levenda et al., 2016; Pickren, 2018).
Equipped with the findings of this literature, this paper can be seen as
a call to go back to basics by further analysing foundational questions
in the political economy of data: What is the economic form of data? How
can value be derived from data? Why does data collection matter? Opening
back up these questions, I argue, productively reframes how we
understand the form and dynamics of data.The 'Big Data strategist' for
Oracle, one of the largest software companies in the world, has said,
'Data is in fact a new kind of capital on par with financial capital for
creating new products and services. And it's not just a metaphor; data
fulfils the literal textbook definition of capital.' (OracleANZ, 2015).
[This statement points to an emerging political economic shift in which
data is created, collected, and circulated as capital.]{.underline} The
previous section described how data has been critically analysed in the
context of capitalism -- implicitly or explicitly -- as a commodity.
However, as [businesses and government bodies begin treating data as
capital,]{.underline} there is a need for examining the characteristics
and dynamics of 'data capital.' This section aims to do so by first
reviewing two theories of capital, from Karl Marx and Pierre Bourdieu,
then using them to analyse data. In Capital, Volume 1, Marx describes
capital as a relationship between money (M) and commodities (C); namely,
the ways they circulate and transform, which he simplifies into two
general formulas. The first formula represents consumption, C-M-C: a
commodity is sold for money which is then used to buy another commodity.
Therefore, C-M-C is the cycle of using money to turn one qualitatively
different thing (e.g. labour power) into another qualitatively different
thing (e.g. coffee). The cycle of consumption is motivated by the
use-value of a commodity and it is completed when money is turned into a
commodity. The second formula represents capital, M-C-M′: money is used
to buy a commodity which is then sold for more money. 'The value \[of
money\] originally advanced, therefore, not only remains intact while in
circulation but increases its magnitude, adds to itself a surplus-value,
or is valorised. And this movement converts it into capital' (Marx,
1990: 252). The cycle of capital is motivated by exchange-value and the
cycle does not complete because capital requires continuous circulation.
When money is turned into a commodity for consumption, rather than
invested to make profit, it ceases to be capital. In addition to 'money
capital' (i.e., invested funds), Marx distinguishes between two forms of
'real capital' employed in the creation of surplus value. Constant
capital is the means of production for commodities (i.e., factories,
machinery, raw materials, etc.). Variable capital is the means of
subsistence for labour power (i.e., the costs of hiring workers).
Expanding on Marx's foundational analysis, Bourdieu theorized two new
forms of capital that are distinct from what he terms economic capital,
'which is immediately and directly convertible into money and may be
institutionalized in the form of property rights' (1986: 242). The other
forms Bourdieu theorized, cultural capital and social capital, stand
alone in their own right while also being 'convertible, in certain
conditions, into economic capital' (p. 242). They are, at their root,
'transformed, disguised forms of economic capital' (p. 251). Cultural
capital contributes to a person's status and success in ways that go
beyond the idea of 'human capital,' which focuses on monetary investment
in education and skills. Cultural capital is a representation of class
and tends to be invested by a person's family and transmitted from a
person's domestic environment. Bourdieu (1986) identifies three types of
cultural capital: embodied (e.g. character traits), objectified (e.g.
art collection), and institutionalised (university degree). Social
capital, according to Bourdieu (p. 248), 'is the aggregate of the actual
or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable
network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual
acquaintance and recognition.' This form of capital accrues by being
included in privileged groups, whether that means being inducted through
rites of passage (e.g. fraternal orders) or through rites of inheritance
(e.g. noble lineage). When people talk about the value of 'who you know'
and 'networking,' they are talking about having and developing social
capital. Building from Marx, we can now frame two common analyses of
data in terms of a debate about what economic form data represents. On
one hand, [data is cast as a digital raw material -- constant capital --
necessary in the production of commodities]{.underline}. It is hard to
read media articles and business reports about data without seeing it
called 'the new oil.' For instance, the cover of a 2017 issue of The
Economist (2017b) proclaims 'The World's Most Valuable Resource' above
an illustration of offshore oil platforms labelled with the names of
major digital platforms like Facebook, Google, and Uber presumably
drilling into an ocean of data. On the other hand, data is cast as a
commodity produced by the digital labour of people posting on Facebook,
clicking on Google, exercising with Fitbits, and all the other things we
do that create data and that data is created about (Fuchs, 2014; Till,
2012). [The cliché about the 'free' services provided digital platforms
is that, 'If you're not the customer, you're the product.']{.underline}1
Through the work of using platforms and devices, people are turned into
commodities that take the form of personal data, which is sold to
advertisers and data brokers. In the age of mass media, this was termed
the 'audience commodity' (Smythe, 1981). Now with social media it is
called the 'data double' among other coinages (Haggerty and Ericson,
2000). Therefore, at the risk of oversimplification, [these two ways of
analysing data -- as raw material and as product of digital labour --
can be recast as a debate about the relationship between real capital
and commodities in the digital economy.]{.underline} Building from
Bourdieu, I suggest a better framing of data is as a form of capital
that is distinct from, but has its roots in, economic capital. Data
capital is more than knowledge about the world, it is discrete bits of
information that are digitally recorded, machine processable, easily
agglomerated, and highly mobile. Like social and cultural capital[, data
capital is convertible, in certain conditions, to economic
capital.]{.underline} But, as the next section 'Deriving value from data
capital' shows, not all value derived from data is necessarily or
primarily monetary. [Data capital is institutionalised in the
information infrastructure of collecting, storing, and processing data;
that is, the smart devices, online platforms, data analytics, network
cables, and server farms.]{.underline} Importantly, these
characteristics of [data capital mean it can be continually captured and
circulated]{.underline}, thus data collection is driven by the logic of
capital accumulation as described by Marx. 'The circulation of money as
capital is an end in itself, for the valorization of value takes place
only within this constantly renewed movement. The movement of capital is
therefore limitless' (Marx, 1990: 253). [This unending accumulation of
capital]{.underline}, represented by M-C-M′-C-M″-C-M‴... , [is a
defining feature of capitalism. In digital capitalism, data is not a
substitute for money, but is rather elevated and put 'on the same level
as financial capital]{.underline},' as a report by Oracle and MIT
Technology Review Custom (2016: 2) states. The imperative, then, is to
constantly collect and circulate data by producing commodities that
create more data and building infrastructure to manage data. The stream
of data must keep flowing and growing. Ultimately, continuing the cycle
of data capital becomes an intrinsic motivation, a driving force, for
firms. As Marx explains, 'Use-values must therefore never be treated as
the immediate aim of the capitalist; nor must the profit on any single
transaction. His aim is rather the unceasing movement of profit-making'
(Marx, 1990: 254). The same can be said of data. The capitalist is not
concerned with the immediate use of a data point or with any single
collection, but rather the unceasing flow of data-creating. This point
is illustrated by the fact that data is very often collected without
specific uses in mind. Indeed, the practice of collecting data first and
figuring it out later is increasingly a core part of how businesses and
government bodies operate. 'It does not matter that the amounts \[of
data\] collected may vastly exceed a firm's imaginative reach or
analytic grasp. The assumption is that it will eventually be useful,
i.e. valuable' (Fourcade and Healy, 2017: 13). At a public talk in early
2017, Andrew Ng, an artificial intelligence researcher who has held top
positions at Google, Baidu, and Coursera, was candid about this
prevailing logic of data accumulation: 'At large companies, sometimes we
launch products not for the revenue, but for the data. We actually do
that quite often \... and we monetize the data through a different
product' (Stanford Graduate School of Business, 2017). The conditions
needed to convert data capital into economic capital may never arrive,
but that does not stop the cycle of accumulation. The shift towards data
capital takes advantage of the ideological and regulatory groundwork
that has been laid since at least the 1980s to create a political
economic landscape conducive to finance capitalism (Konczal and
Abernathy, 2015). Under neoliberal governance, financial capital is
treated as if it exists in transnational space beyond borders and
governance (Major, 2012). The same attitudes are directly applied to
data capital. This view was crystallised by Carl Bildt (2015), the
former Prime Minister of Sweden and chair of the Global Commission on
Internet Governance, in an op-ed for the Financial Times: 'Barriers
against the free flow of data are, in effect, barriers against trade.'
Bildt was rebuking proponents of 'digital sovereignty' rules in Europe,
which would require non-EU companies to keep data about EU citizens in
servers that are geographically based in Europe. Any restraints on the
flow of data are said to hinder economic growth and technological
innovation (Morozov, 2015). Trade deals like the Transatlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (aim to)
enshrine the free flow of data across countries and continents (Selby,
2017). [Like finance, data is now governed as an engine of growth. If
financial firms are free to shuttle capital from country to country,
then similarly technology corporations must also be free to store and
sell data wherever they want.]{.underline} This means, for example, that
a company could collect the personal information of Americans, store the
data in Taiwan, and sell it in Europe (Rossiter, 2017). The focus on
data and datafication should not be seen as usurping financialisation,
but rather as adding new sources of value and new tools of accumulation.
There is a long history of crossover between innovations in information
technology and innovations in finance (MacKenzie, 2018). Far from being
in competition with each other, Wall Street and Silicon Valley are
converging around data capital as the new frontier of accumulation and
circulation.The question of what kinds of data are collected and how
they are used is very important. So far, this paper has treated data in
a generalised way for the sake of analysing it as a form of capital. [Of
course, not all data is the same, nor is it used in the same way. The
same can be said of capital in general. Similarly, value is derived from
data in a number of different ways.]{.underline} Different industries
necessarily accumulate different kinds of data to fit their own
motivations and goals. The focus is typically put on 'user data,' such
as from exercise apps that collect data about people's physical
activity, vital signs, and geolocation. But, as the examples below show,
value can also be squeezed from many other kinds of data about things
like machinery, transportation, and moon phases. A full analysis of
different types of data and in-depth theorising of how value is derived
from data are both outside the scope of this paper. However, in this
section, I provide an outline of five major ways data is used to create
value. The list is not meant to be comprehensive. Future work is needed
about the increasing number of ways and reasons that data capital is
accumulated and valorised, especially by companies, governments, and
organisations that are not typically treated as part of the 'technology
sector.' Data is used to profile and target people. Many business models
and services in data capitalism are based on the value proposition that
knowing more about people will, in some way, translate to more profit
and/or power. Some examples include: Internet-based companies often make
their revenue by serving personalised advertisements. Data brokers
collate data to create dossiers on individuals and categorise them into
market segments. Credit bureaus crunch data so they can assign scores
meant to denote a person's financial risk and trustworthiness. Retailers
can charge different prices based on the customer's characteristics.
Political consultants analyse data to decide who is susceptible to
certain kinds of messaging and influence. Data is used to optimise
systems. Processes can become more efficient by analysing data that
reveals how to eliminate waste, improve productivity, and do more with
less. This might mean an industrial manufacturer installing sensors on
machines to monitor and adjust their operation. Or, city government
using algorithmic analysis to assess how public services should be run.
This way of deriving value is also the basis for Taylorism, starting
with time--motion studies of factory workers in the early 1900s. Now,
digital Taylorism is represented by wristbands patented by Amazon that
are strapped to warehouse workers to track where their hands are at all
times and provide 'haptic feedback' when they work inefficiently (Novak,
2018). Data is used to manage and control things. This is a
power/knowledge relationship in which data is a digital, mobile,
processable form of knowledge. The idea is that by amassing data about a
thing, then the ability to exercise power over that thing -- and, in
turn, extract more data from it -- is enhanced. This might be as mundane
as a person keeping track of their diet and exercise so they can manage
their health. Or, as worrying as police using body-worn cameras and
drones equipped with facial recognition and license plate reader
software. Or, as complex as an engineer overseeing the traffic patterns
of a city so they can manage how millions of people move through space.
Such data can be used to inform human decision-making or fed into
automated systems that respond in real-time. Data is used to model
probabilities. With enough data covering a wide range of variables over
a period of the time -- fed to the right algorithms and analysts -- many
companies promise they can predict the future. While these 'predictions'
are actually probabilities, there is a growing market for data-driven
forecasting tools. For example, police departments use 'predictive'
systems to create 'heat lists' and 'hot spots' that name who and where
has a high likelihood of criminal activity. HunchLab, a predictive
policing tool, uses data about 'dozens of other factors like population
density; census data; the locations of bars, churches, schools, and
transportation hubs; schedules for home games -- even moon phases'
(Chammah and Hansen, 2016: n.p.). Similarly, urban control rooms process
a constant stream of data to create simulations of events like disaster
response and snapshots of what the city might look like at certain times
and days in the future. Data is used to build stuff. Digital systems and
services are often built on data. They require data to operate, they use
existing stores of data, and they collect new streams of data. As
services become platforms and devices become 'smart' they also become
data-driven and Internet-connected to facilitate the flow of data. For
example, Uber would not work without real-time data about drivers and
passengers. Many upgrades to consumer goods (e.g. smart homes) and
transformations to urban environments (e.g. smart cities) are premised
on extracting and exploiting data. Advances in emerging technologies
like artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles also require
mountains of diverse data. Data is used to grow the value of assets.
Things like buildings, infrastructure, vehicles, and machinery are
depreciating assets. They lose value over time as the forces of entropy
-- or, wear and tear -- take their toll. However, upgrading assets with
smart technologies that collect data about their use helps combat the
normal cycle of deterioration. As financier Stuart Kirk (2018) states,
'Artificial intelligence combined with the internet of things will
result in physical things becoming more adaptive and responsive --
thereby extending their useful lives.' Rather than depreciating,
smartified assets can maintain and gain value. Or, if they do not grow
value, at least data can slow its decay. Data extraction When we talk
about data as being 'collected,' 'gathered,' or even 'mined', the image
conjured is one of neutral accumulation, as if data existed out in the
world as a distinct thing readily available to be harvested. However,
analysing this process in terms of extraction emphasises the people
targeted by, and the exploitative nature of, dataveillance. Much of the
valuable data capital extracted from the world is about people -- their
identities, beliefs, behaviours, and other personal information. As
Karen Gregory (2014: n.p.) puts it: 'Big Data, like Soylent Green, is
made of people.' This means that accumulating data often goes
hand-in-hand with increasingly invasive systems for probing, monitoring,
and tracking people (Schneier, 2016). Surveillance -- or,
'dataveillance' -- capabilities are integrated into everything ranging
from consumer goods to civic infrastructure. For businesses, much of the
value produced by 'smart' technologies does not necessarily come from
you buying the good, but rather from you using it. (Or, even just having
it around since many smart technologies are always in sense and record
mode.) Interacting with smart technologies -- especially ones integrated
into your everyday, personal life -- generates reams of data that would
otherwise be out of reach to the companies that want it. And, it seems,
to the [governments]{.underline} that [want]{.underline} that
[data]{.underline}: In February 2016, the then US director of national
intelligence, James Clapper, admitted to a Senate panel that government
agencies may [treat networked smart technologies as a portal into
people's homes and lives]{.underline}: 'In the future, intelligence
services might use the \[Internet of Things\] for identification,
surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for
recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials'
(Ackerman and Thielman, 2016: n.p.). A typical example of a smart update
to an everyday technology is the refrigerator. The regular refrigerator
is a passive object: it just keeps food cold. The smart refrigerator is
an active object: it keeps food cold, but it also keeps track of things
like your favourite brands, what foods you eat at what times, and when
your food is almost out or expired. The smart refrigerator can then take
that data and use it, for example, to send targeted advertisements,
recommend sponsored recipes, monitor your dietary intake, and purchase
replacement food from the grocery store. The smart refrigerator can also
be used for other purposes that are far from fridge-like, such as a
surveillance device remotely accessed by police who wish to peek into
the owner's house (Butler, 2017). This is how the logic of accumulation
works: it transforms the refrigerator into a data producing, collecting
and transmitting machine. The same logic is behind the growing stable of
smart technologies that are increasingly embedded with sensors,
processors and network connections. 'The genuine Internet of Things
wants to invade that refrigerator, measure it, instrument it, monitor
any interactions with it; it would cheerfully give away a fridge at
cost,' argues Bruce Sterling (2014: loc. 68). The pushback against
business models based on data capital are already starting to play out:
In 2017, an American appliance maker, Whirlpool, filed trade complaints
that asked the US government to impose tariffs on its Korean
competitors, LG and Samsung, because the Korean companies are selling
smart appliances at cheap prices, which is eating into the market share
of companies like Whirlpool. LG and Samsung are able to do this because
they recognize, as The New Yorker observed, 'the way to win in a
data-driven business is to push prices as low as possible in order to
build your customer base, enhance data flow, and cash in in the
long-term' (Davidson, 2017: n.p.). While Whirlpool is looking to cash in
on the purchase of an appliance, LG and Samsung are banking on the data
that comes from people using the appliance. Thus, rather than existing
only as a commodity to be sold, a smart device becomes (perhaps
primarily) a means of producing data. This logic influences the design
of systems ranging from robotic vacuum cleaners secretly mapping users'
homes so the manufacturer can exploit that data (Deahl, 2017) to the
methods of urban planning deployed to manage cities (Barns, 2017[). Data
accumulation drives many key decisions about]{.underline} technological
development[, political governance]{.underline}, and business models. As
Shoshana Zuboff explains, within the context of what she calls
'surveillance capitalism,' 'The logic of accumulation organizes
perception and shapes the expression of technological affordances at
their roots. It is the taken-for-granted context of any business model.
Its assumptions are largely tacit, and its power to shape the field of
possibilities is therefore largely invisible. It defines objectives,
successes, failures, and problems. It determines what is measured, and
what is passed over; how resources and people are allocated and
organized; who is valued in what roles; what activities are undertaken
-- and to what purpose. The logic of accumulation produces its own
social relations and with that its conceptions and uses of authority and
power.' (Zuboff, 2015: 77) When data is treated as a form of capital,
the imperative to collect as much data, from as many sources, by any
means possible intensifies existing practices of accumulation and leads
to the creation of new ones. Indeed, following in the footsteps of other
extractive enterprises through capitalism's history such as land grabs
and resource mining (Mezzadra and Neilson, 2017), many of the now common
practices of data accumulation should actually be understood in terms of
the more forceful practice of data extraction, wherein data is taken
without meaningful consent and fair compensation for the producers and
sources of that data. The terminology used to describe the ways data is
accumulated -- especially data about people -- elides the fact that this
data is often acquired in hidden ways for purposes unknown to the
targets of dataveillance (Andrejevic, 2014). The question of consent is
relatively straightforward. The problematic way technology firms treat
consent is no secret; it is an issue raised often by journalists and
academics. When companies seek consent to record, use, and/or sell a
person's data, it is typically done in the form of a contract. The most
common kind is called an end-user licensing agreements (EULA). They are
a hallmark of digital technology and account for most of the contracts
we enter into -- almost on a daily basis if you use the Internet or
software (Thatcher et al., 2016). These are the pages on websites and
applications that make you click 'agree' or 'accept' before you can use
the service. EULAs are known as 'standard-form' or 'boilerplate'
contracts because they are generically applied to all users (Zamir,
2014). They are one-sided, non-negotiated, and non-negotiable; you
either agree or you are denied access. 'It is hard, therefore, to
consider them to be free and voluntary arrangements since one party has
no power to enact their demands' (Birch, 2016: 124). Companies are
routinely caught smuggling dubious clauses into their EULAs; like, for
example, requiring users to give up rights to ownership of their data or
to restrict what kind of data is collected and how it is used (Hutton
and Henderson, 2017). Moreover, EULAs are designed to prevent even the
most enterprising person from being informed of the binding terms and
conditions. They are long, dense legal documents. One study concluded it
would take 76 days, working for 8 hours a day, to read the privacy
policies a person typically encounters in a year (Madrigal, 2012). EULAs
are the ideal-type of pro forma 'consent,' which may be better-termed
acquiescence (Pasquale, 2015). That is, EULAs are less a method of
consent in any meaningful and more a form of compliance. As Jaron Lanier
(2013: 314) argues, 'The reason people click \'yes\' is not that they
understand what they\'re doing, but that that it is the only viable
option other than boycotting a company in general, which is getting
harder to do.' Thus, even in many cases where people must actively agree
to their data being accumulated, this agreement bears little resemblance
to common meanings of consent -- let alone robust forms of informed
consent. When a thing is taken without consent we call it 'theft.' Just
because the thing taken here is information about a person, rather than
some material object, the ethical relevance should not be nullified. It
is extraction nonetheless. The question of fair compensation is more
complicated, in large part because it can be difficult to put a fair
price on personal information. Different types of data are valued
differently by different businesses. The value of data also rises
non-linearly in relation to the amount of data. The larger and more
diverse a data bank, the more information and uses can be derived from
it. So one individual's data may not be readily converted to economic
capital, but the aggregated data of hundreds, thousands, millions of
individuals can be immensely valuable. Even though it is difficult to
price data, we can judge the fairness of compensation in at least two
ways: (1) what kind of compensation, if any, is offered for data and (2)
what is the difference between the compensation for data producers and
the value obtained by data capitalists? First, compensation most often
comes in the form of access to services like Facebook's platform and
Google's search engine. Rather than charging money to use the service,
the owner collects data as payment. Even if we concede that some people
think this is perfectly fair compensation, these service providers are
outnumbered by the countless companies that collect, use, and sell
personal data often without the knowledge of -- let alone compensation
for -- those whose data they possess (Bouk, forthcoming; Crain, 2016).
Many companies fail the first test right away: receiving nothing can
hardly be seen as fair. Second, the value of data capital is massive.
Some of the wealthiest companies in the world, like Facebook and Google,
are built on data capital. The data broker industry is estimated to
generate \$200bn in annual revenue (Crain, 2016). The three biggest data
brokers alone -- Experian, Equifax and Transunion -- each bring in
billions of dollars annually. Even for relatively small data brokers,
the difference between the value of data and the compensation provided
for it is striking (Roderick, 2014). Additionally, other major sectors
like finance, insurance and manufacturing are increasingly relying on
data capital to generate value. For many of these companies the data
they use is primarily about people and created by those people doing
things. These companies are accumulating billions of dollars in surplus
value from the 'digital labour' done by people (Scholz, 2012), while
paying little to nothing in return. Thatcher et al. (2016: 994) argue
that these extractive practices go so far as to 'mirror processes of
primitive accumulation or accumulation by dispossession that occur as
capitalism colonizes previously noncommodified, private times and
places.' When a person does not receive a fair offer for the work they
have done or thing they have sold, we call it 'exploitation' -- and this
level of exploitation and inequity is indicative of extraction. Before
concluding, it is important to note that not all data extraction is
equal. There are crucial issues related to the ways identity and class
affect how, what, and why data is extracted. At times, data is
disproportionally extracted from certain groups, such as when poor
people of colour are subjected to systematic tracking by government
agencies and financial institutions (Eubanks, 2018). At other times,
certain groups are missing from data sets, such as when facial
recognition systems inaccurately identify people of colour because they
have been trained with data composed of mostly white male faces --
people who look like their programmers (Lohr, 2018). While it is beyond
the scope of this article, there is a need for further analysis of the
unevenness of data extraction. Such work should build from critical
studies of information technology; some relevant, recent books include:
Digital Sociologies (Daniels et al. 2016), The Intersectional Internet
(Noble and Tynes, 2016), Programmed Inequality (Hicks, 2017), Algorithms
of Oppression (Noble, 2018), and Automating Inequality (Eubanks, 2018).
My hope is that this article also lends theoretical support to this
future work. Conclusion [This article has centred data as a core
component of political economy in the 21st century.]{.underline} It has
analysed the way in which data is collected and circulated like capital
and is treated by governments and firms like capital. By applying the
theories of Marx and Bourdieu, data is analysed as a form of capital
that is distinct from, but has its roots in, economic capital. Data
collection is thus driven by the perpetual cycle of capital
accumulation, which in turn drives capital to construct and rely upon a
world in which everything is made of data. The supposed universality of
data reframes everything as falling under the domain of data capitalism.
All spaces must be subjected to datafication. If the universe is
conceived of as a potentially infinite reserve of data, then that means
the accumulation and circulation of data can be sustained forever. [The
imperative to capture all data, from all sources, by any means possible
influences many key decisions about business models, political
governance, and technological development.]{.underline} Following this
imperative leads to accumulation by extraction in which personal data is
taken with little regard for consent and compensation. By analysing
surveillance technology and the data economy in terms of extraction,
critical work can move beyond focusing (almost exclusively) on privacy
and security. As important as these issues are, they elide the systemic
issues of inequity and exploitation that are endemic to the contemporary
political economy of data (Coll, 2014). Moreover, conceiving of many
common practices of data collection as extraction helps lay the
normative groundwork for political and legal responses to rampant,
invasive data accumulation. Such responses could include regulations --
essentially capital controls -- on what types of data companies can
collect, how they can collect it, where they can send and store it, and
how much data a company can possess, both in aggregate and about
individuals. It could also include new models of data ownership and
governance like, for example, 'managing crucial parts of the data
economy as public infrastructure' (The Economist, 2017a: n.p.). The fact
that a featured article in The Economist would recommend that
governments take over parts of the data economy and break up
monopolistic firms like Google should be seen as a bellwether for how
powerful Big Data (as in Big Oil and Big Finance) has become. This
illustrates the need for further critical thought about the political
economy of data, as well as reforms and alternatives to data capitalism.
The analysis in this paper is not meant to mark a new epoch in political
economy wherein -- as executives and engineers in Silicon Valley are
fond of saying -- everything has changed and nothing will ever be the
same. Instead, data capitalism is more of a shift in focus; it is a
transition toward conceptualising a new kind of capital and new methods
of accumulation. This transition follows from one of the dominant
socio-economic regimes of the past few decades: finance capitalism
(Davis and Walsh, 2017; Krippner, 2005; Konczal and Abernathy, 2015). As
this article has shown, there are similarities between financialisation
and datafication. Both have significant 'implications for the production
of space, corporate governance, accumulation regimes, and everyday life'
(Fields, 2017: 1). Both seek to maximise value extraction by using
innovative methods of capital creation and circulation, whether through
complex financial instruments or complex information technologies. Both
use technically opaque systems that shield them from oversight
(Pasquale, 2015), use their political influence to skirt regulation
(Roderick, 2014), and use their powerful capabilities to engage in
exploitative and predatory practices (Taylor and Sadowski, 2015). In
addition to these similarities, there is direct overlap between the two
regimes, such as credit agencies using large sets of personal and
demographic data to create hyper-individualised policies and scores
(Hurley and Adebayo, 2017) and Wall Street traders using 'high frequency
trading' algorithms to circulate capital at hyper-speed (Arnoldi, 2016).
The institutions leading the way in data capitalism are explicit about
the connections between financial capital and data capital. They are not
calling for one to replace the other, rather they are arguing that
finance and data should be seen as different but equal forms of capital,
which supercharge each other. Datafication, like financialisation before
it, is a new frontier of accumulation and next step in capitalism.
Compared to financialisation, datafication is still in its early days,
but the level of wealth and power wielded by data capitalists is already
massive and still growing. The theories and methods used to analyse
finance capitalism and information technology must now be synthesised
and applied to studying the meaning, practices and implications of
datafication as a political economic regime.

### Data/Digital Infrastructure

#### Data collection is now a form of capital used to fuel digital capitalism

The goal of transforming everything into data and the search for new
sources of data echoes imperialist modes of accumulation (Luxemburg,
1951; Thatcher et al., 2016). In short[, as capitalism faces crises of
accumulation, there is a need to find new sources of value and new
places to offload goods]{.underline}. 'Old strategies of accumulation
are re-attempted in new spaces and new strategies are crafted through
trial and error in the never-ending quest to surpass or displace the
internal contradictions which lead to crisis' (Greene and Joseph, 2015:
224). [This could mean subjecting previously noncommodified and
non-monetised parts of life to the logic of capitalism or colonising new
territories so they are brought into the global capitalist web as sites
of extraction]{.underline} (Moore, 2015[). We can see this dynamic of
'data colonialism' when technology corporations like Facebook and Google
move into territories like India and Africa]{.underline} (Thatcher et
al., 2016). They do so under the guise of providing subsidised services
that connect marginalised people to the Internet, yet the companies also
benefit greatly by opening markets, locking people into their platforms,
and tapping sources of data (Solon, 2017). [These new places with new
people provide new opportunities for data accumulation. The same
imperialist tactics are being replayed now, but updated for the digital
age.]{.underline} As we can see, this growing body of research on
critical data studies (Dalton et al., 2016) has shown how the
production, distribution, and use of data is situated within an emerging
political economy that has wide-ranging implications across society:
from the restructuring of cities and the state (Kitchin et al., 2015;
Leszczynski, 2012), to the (re)development of electrical and
computational infrastructure (Levenda et al., 2016; Pickren, 2018).
Equipped with the findings of this literature, this paper can be seen as
a call to go back to basics by further analysing foundational questions
in the political economy of data: What is the economic form of data? How
can value be derived from data? Importantly, these [characteristics of
data capital mean it can be continually captured and circulated, thus
data collection is driven by the logic of capital accumulation as
described by Marx]{.underline}. 'The circulation of money as capital is
an end in itself, for the valorization of value takes place only within
this constantly renewed movement. The movement of capital is therefore
limitless' (Marx, 1990: 253). [This unending accumulation of capital,
represented by M-C-M0-C-M00-C-M-. . . , is a defining feature of
capitalism. In]{.underline} digital capitalism, [data is not a
substitute for money, but is rather elevated and put 'on the same level
as financial capital]{.underline},' as a report by Oracle and MIT
Technology Review Custom (2016: 2) states. The imperative, then, is to
constantly collect and circulate data by producing commodities that
create more data and building infrastructure to manage data. The stream
of data must keep flowing and growing. [Ultimately, continuing the cycle
of data capital becomes an intrinsic motivation, a driving force, for
firms]{.underline}. As Marx explains, 'Use-values must therefore never
be treated as the immediate aim of the capitalist; nor must the profit
on any single transaction. His aim is rather the unceasing movement of
profit-making' (Marx, 1990: 254). The same can be said of data[. The
capitalist is not concerned with the immediate use of a data point or
with any single collection, but rather the unceasing flow of
data-creating]{.underline}. This point is illustrated by the fact that
data is very often collected without specific uses in mind. Indeed, the
practice of collecting data first and figuring it out later is
increasingly a core part of how businesses and government bodies
operate. 'It does not matter that the amounts \[of data\] collected may
vastly exceed a firm's imaginative reach or analytic grasp. [The
assumption is that it will eventually be useful, i.e. valuable'
(]{.underline}Fourcade and Healy, 2017: 13). At a public talk in early
2017, Andrew Ng, an artificial 4 Big Data & Society intelligence
researcher who has held top positions at Google, Baidu, and Coursera,
was candid about this prevailing logic of data accumulation: 'At large
companies, sometimes we launch products not for the revenue, but for the
data. We actually do that quite often \... and we monetize the data
through a different product' (Stanford Graduate School of Business,
2017). [The conditions needed to convert data capital into economic
capital may never arrive, but that does not stop the cycle of
accumulation.]{.underline}

### Experts/Think Tanks

#### Think tanks, armed forces, and contractors work in conjunction to naturalize and expand military domination

After what seems a couple of decades of near quietude, Dwight
Eisenhower's bête noire, [the military-industrial complex, is again
fashionable.]{.underline} We see it in the 2021 outpouring of articles
and books, a (now rare) U.S. Senate hearing, and even an extended
encyclopedia entry.1 A [more accurate and meaningful term, which could
lead the inquisitive to **the structural roots of U.S. militarism**,
would be the industrial-military-congressional complex.]{.underline}
Nonetheless, it must come as some relief to those who leverage the
Pentagon, and did so with the better-named U.S. Department of War
(1789--1947), that the focus is on the military in the first instance
and not on the industrial interests that usually determine (or steer)
the larger dynamics of procurement, geostrategic diplomacy, and military
strategy.2 [An adequate encapsulation is the iron triangle, with (1)
military contractor corporations]{.underline} [forming]{.underline} one
side ([the base)]{.underline} of the equilateral triangle; (2) [the
military forces]{.underline}, intelligence agencies, expedition-ready
National Guard units, mercenary private security companies, and veteran
organizations [forming another side; and]{.underline} (3) the [civilian
national security state]{.underline} ([headed by the chief executive,
the secretary of state, t]{.underline}he National Security Council,
congressional members of key arms and security committees, NASA,
[and]{.underline} military-/contractor-funded but seemingly independent
Washington DC [think tanks]{.underline}) [on the remaining
side]{.underline}. [The complex interdependent dynamics of the iron
triangle take form as strategy, political-economy factors, and
international affairs shift and drift---with constant, but varying,
pressure]{.underline} (particularly from its base and both sides) **[to
expand the resources it commands.]{.underline}**3¶ [Certainly, the U.S.
withdrawal from Afghanistan has provoked a bit of reflection that
sometimes leads to reprising the structural interests]{.underline} and
embedded powers [that keep military expenditures rising]{.underline}, or
never falling much for long. But normally a bit of dismaying information
regarding Pentagon "waste, fraud, and abuse" is as far (and as deep) as
critics care to go. [Lodged in U.S. historical memory, the
military-industrial complex at best provides a hazy, often misleading,
construct]{.underline}. As U.S. military spending in the fiscal year
2022 reaches \$1.6 trillion for the broadly defined military sector,
[there is more]{.underline}---much more---[to consider]{.underline}.4

### NATO

#### NATO is the pinnacle of US militarist and imperial aggression- it diverts resources toward military endeavors and engages in offensive operations to secure US interests, making war inevitable

Nick **Wright in 2014**

NATO: Imperialism's key military tool; 21 Manifesto;
https://21centurymanifesto.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/nato-imperialisms-key-military-tool/

It was described as "the war to end all wars," but [today]{.underline},
a century later, [the military potential to destroy lives and a liveable
environment is at a terrifying level and continues to
rise.]{.underline}¶ [Everyday]{.underline}, all over the world, [people
suffer from armed conflicts, military build-up]{.underline}, occupation,
acts of intimidation and aggression, modernization [and proliferation of
nuclear weapons]{.underline} and other weapons of mass destruction.
**[The capitalist economic crisis is further aggravating peoples' life
while profits of the war industries are growing]{.underline}**. [The
ground for military aggressions and imperialist wars was never
determined by accidental events]{.underline} or personal decisions.¶ The
centenary of World War One should be a moment for reflection, for
strengthening peace and for encouraging international friendship and
solidarity on the basis of equality and respect for the sovereignty of
the peoples.. It must be directed toward ending economic domination of
the monopolies and multinational corporations as well as towards
aggressive military alliances. Therefore, [we should act against NATO,
the number 1 war machine in the world.]{.underline}¶ The World Peace
Council, founded shortly after the end of the World War II under the
slogan "No more War-No more Fascism" underlines the need to draw
conclusions from the period which led to the Nazi invasion to Poland on
1st September 1939 and the beginning of the second World War. [The
growing imperialist ambitions of Nazi Germany then met with the
imperialist agenda of other forces, who did not oppose the German
expansion to the East in the beginning]{.underline}. The glorious
resistance of peoples against Fascism and Nazism in combination with the
struggle and the tens of millions of victims of the USSR, led to the
liberation of Europe from fascism and the victory of the peoples. The
post war international situation, the foundation of the UN and its
charter created a new situation for the peoples and their strive for
freedom and sovereignty. All this is being fiercely challenged and
overthrown today, [efforts to substitute often the UN by NATO are at
place, neo-fascist forces are on the grow in many parts of
Europe]{.underline} serving reactionary ideologies and plans against the
peoples. [The WPC opposes the growing militarization of international
relations,]{.underline} the imperialist plans for the "Great Middle
East", the "Pivot of USA to Asia", and the interference in the sovereign
affairs of peoples and nations in Latin America.¶ NATO: Imperialism's
key military tool- 65 years of crimes against humanity **[NATO is the
largest, strongest and most aggressive military alliance in the world
today]{.underline}**. **[Firmly dominated by
US-imperialism]{.underline}**, [NATO is also a pillar of the European
Union's defense strategy]{.underline}. NATO currently has 28 member
states across North America and Europe. Another 22 countries are engaged
in the so-called Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC). Next to this
another 19 countries are engaged with NATO through programs such as the
"Mediterranean Dialogue", the "Istanbul Cooperation Initiative" or the
"Partnership for Peace" across the globe.¶ [Since 1991, NATO's has
aggressively expanded its membership and theatre of
operations]{.underline}. [This fact alone reveals its fundamental
purpose: to be a key tool of Western imperialist domination of the
globe.]{.underline}¶ NATO is an enemy of peace. [NATO is committed to
the doctrines of first strike and pre-emptive strikes]{.underline}. As
an offensive military alliance [it stands ready to intervene before
diplomacy has been given a proper chance]{.underline}, **[if such is in
the interest of Western imperialism.]{.underline}** [NATO's expansion
and provocations]{.underline} -- **[as the current crisis in Ukraine
demonstrates -- are directly responsible for destabilization, unrest,
violence and war.]{.underline}**¶ [NATO is an enemy of the peoples. When
it intervenes, its members regularly use toxic weapons]{.underline}
containing depleted uranium or white phosphor. Moreover[, NATO considers
nuclear weapons to be a fundamental part of its defense
strategy.]{.underline} **[The alliance aggressively pursues and promotes
military provocation and intervention all around the
globe]{.underline}**, **[and the results are always increased
destructio]{.underline}**n, displacement, and death. The examples of the
wars in the former Yugoslavia and the creation of the protectorate of
Kosovo, in Afghanistan and Libya, as well as the aggression against
Syria, all bear witness to the disastrous humanitarian impact of NATO's
intervention. In Iraq, where NATO took on part of the reconstruction
effort, it brought neither peace nor democracy.¶ [NATO is an enemy of
peace and of the peoples]{.underline}. Without any public debate,
[NATO's European member states are hosting U.S. nuclear weapons on their
territory.]{.underline} In 2010 a secret agreement on the deployment of
modernized versions of B61 warheads extended this presence by several
decades, not leaving any space for democratic debate on the matter.
Through its Article 5 as well, the NATO alliance imposes obligations on
member states that are incompatible with the sovereign right of states
to decide on peace and war.¶ The coming summit of NATO in Wales will
adopt and further develop the Lisbon summit decisions (2010), will use
old and new pretexts for its role as "world sheriff" securing markets,
energy resources and spheres of influence, to the detriment of the
peoples rights and needs.¶ [The dissolution of NATO must be a priority
for those defending peace, social justice and progress, along with the
right of every people to struggle for the disengagement from
it.]{.underline}

[Raising the slogans of 'No to NATO Expansion']{.underline} and 'No to

concerned. Starmer and his parliamentary whips threatened to exclude 12
Labour MPs from the Parliamentary Labour Party if they spoke at a rally
with an anti-NATO message. Starmer has repeatedly stated Labour's
complete loyalty to NATO, a message to the British capitalist class that
under him Labour can be trusted. Technically, any member of Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament (CND) could be excluded from the Labour Party
because of the campaign's anti-NATO position, although, for the moment,
this is unlikely to be implemented. In the context of Starmer's
prostration before NATO and British capitalism, it is strange to find a
left-wing website attacking Jeremy Corbyn for making 'an anti-NATO
speech.¶ In the context of the present war, it is utterly cynical for
Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to excuse atrocities committed by
Russian forces by reference to what the West did in Iraq and
Afghanistan. 'If you can commit anti-civilian atrocities, then so can
we' is unlikely to be a convincing argument as far as world public
opinion is concerned. Even worse, Russian commentators on Channel 4 News
merely say 'war is hell, this is war'. The death, pain, suffering, and
misery imposed on the Ukrainian people cannot be justified by any
reference to the crimes of the West, whether the leading Western states
were wearing their NATO hats or not. The central slogans of the Left and
all progressive forces have to be against the Russian war, for a
ceasefire and a withdrawal of all Russian troops.¶ In Britain, there is
an enormous mobilisation of ordinary people and even whole communities
to give material aid to refugees from Ukraine. Polish centres up and
down the country, as well as Ukrainian community centres, are awash with
donations of money, clothes, sleeping bags, and other necessities that
refugees might need for their onward journeys. Of course, this outburst
of social solidarity is promoted by the awful scenes of carnage and
destruction in Ukraine. [It's true that the incredible brutality of the
Western-backed]{.underline} and organised [bombing campaign]{.underline}
by the Saudi-led coalition [in Yemen has not produced such an outpouring
of solidarity because it has been barely covered]{.underline} in the
mass media, [and]{.underline} because [Ukrainians are 'people like
us.']{.underline}¶ Nonetheless, people who collect support for Ukrainian
refugees, and millions more, are rightly horrified by the Russian
attacks and their dreadful consequences. The anti-war movement cannot
turn its face away from these people but should participate, to the best
of our ability, in such actions. We must encourage people to give
material aid and demand refugees be admitted to Britain.¶ [Because of
the ongoing inter-imperialist conflict, there are **competing
narratives** about what is happening]{.underline} on a world scale. [The
overwhelming narrative in]{.underline} the [Western media is about the
defence of democracy against Russian and Chinese]{.underline}
dictatorship and [aggression]{.underline}. **[But in reality, there is a
huge and developing inter-imperialist conflict, in which the United
States is a major source of militarisation]{.underline}** and
aggression.¶ Regrettably, a lot of people on the Left internationally do
not clearly condemn the Russian invasion and champion the right of the
Ukrainian people to self-defence. It is easier, as they see it, just to
take sides with one imperialist camp or another. This we should refuse
to do. [Our understanding of the role of NATO and the United States
cannot lead us to downplay or in any way excuse the Russian
attack.]{.underline} On the morning of February 24, within minutes of
hearing the news of the invasion, I posted on Facebook condemning the
attack as an act of criminal brutality and irresponsibility; I said
thousands would die in the initial fighting. [It is this attack that
must remain the target of left-wing mobilisation and protest, despite
our understanding of the developing global inter-imperialist
conflict]{.underline}.

#### NATO is a tool for US imperial expansion- it secures global resources for American based companies

Two contradictions between the ideals professed in the Washington Treaty
and actually existing reality were present right from NATO's birth. [The
professed commitment to democracy was belied by the fact that the
original signatories included Portugal, at that time ruled by the
quasi-fascist police state of Antonio Salazar]{.underline}. Portugal did
not become democratic until Salazar's Estada Novo was overthrown by a
popular revolution in 1974, twenty-five years after NATO's
founding[.]{.underline} NATO member Greece, which joined the alliance in
1952, was ruled by a military junta from April 1967 through its
overthrow in 1974, but NATO supported the junta throughout.¶ [The
commitment to peace is likewise questionable. Consider that NATO is the
most powerful military organization on the planet, and has been since it
was founded. NATO member countries collectively spent more US\$900
billion on military expenditures in 2016 (roughly US\$600 billion of
which was spent by the United States), more than half of the
approximately US\$1.7 trillion spent globally on the military that
year.]{.underline} Even in its founding year 1949, the twelve NATO
members collectively spent an estimated US\$116 billion (in year 2000
US\$) on military expenditures, compared with the estimated US\$84
billion spent by their principal opponent the USSR. From these figures,
it is clear that NATO has enjoyed military superiority over its rivals
since its inception.¶ When one adds to this the approximately US\$218
billion spent collectively on the military by close NATO allies Saudi
Arabia, India, Japan and South Korea in 2016, the military dominance of
the alliance becomes even clearer. NATO members and these four countries
accounted for two-thirds of global military spending in 2016, compared
with the US\$66 billion spent by Russia (approximately 4% of the global
total). To put Russia's military spending into perspective, NATO member
the U.K., hardly a great power any longer and completely incapable of
launching a war on its own, spent more than US\$60 billion on its
military that year, which is 90% of the Russian figure. The U.K. is one
of 29 NATO members and not the largest military spender in the alliance,
by an order of magnitude. There is simply no comparison between the
military capacity of NATO and the military capacity of Russia. China
comes closer, but the US\$228 billion spent by China (approximately 13%
of global military spending) is still dwarfed by the amounts spent
collectively by NATO members. Even if the massive spending of the United
States is removed from the equation, NATO members still collectively
spent substantially more than China did on its military in 2016, and
approximately four times what Russia did.¶ The alliance now directly
touches Russia's borders in the Baltic, and if Ukraine and Georgia were
to join, would add thousands of kilometres of shared border in Russia's
west and south. This at a time when the Russian state probably controls
less territory than at any point in history since the reign of Catherine
the Great. As has been noted elsewhere, NATO has now achieved what
neither Hitler nor Napoleon were able to -- the encirclement of a
territorially reduced Russia by a hostile military alliance.¶ [This
policy of enlargement is not an accident, but rather a reflection of the
wider dynamic of competition in the international state
system]{.underline}. In a capitalist economy, individual firms compete
with each other for greater shares of a given market, and thus greater
profits[. The dynamic of competition in the economy compels individual
firms -- units of capital -- to constantly seek technological
innovations so as to produce their goods more cheaply and undercut their
competitors. Those firms that fail to innovate go bankrupt, with their
assets bought up by other firms.]{.underline} So there is a tendency in
a competitive economy for individual firms to become smaller in number
but greater in size over time[. Eventually, a given market becomes
dominated by a small number of very large firms. Think about internet
search, for instance -- after proliferation of different search engines
in the 1990s, a very small number of firms dominate today, with one of
them, Google, being preponderant.]{.underline}¶ [This market
'maturation' compels firms to seek out new markets elsewhere as they can
no longer grow their profits in their home market.]{.underline} So
successful firms tend to grow beyond the borders of the state in which
they're based. [This brings them into competition with firms (capitals)
based in other states, internationalizing the economic competition
between units of capital and compelling national states to compete with
each other, each defending the interests, markets and profits of their
'own' firms.]{.underline} So, the economic competition between
capitalist firms tends to become political competition between
capitalist states[. This political aspect of capitalist competition is
conducted with all the means at a state's disposal - trade deals and
regulations, tariffs, alliances both economic and military, and the
threat of or actual use of military force.]{.underline}¶ [The expansion
of NATO is best understood through this lens. Russia and China are
capitalist societies, just as are the United States and its allies,
including Canada, and the other states mentioned here, such as Saudi
Arabia and India.]{.underline} All of them are locked in a system of
competitive rivalry as each tries to out-maneuver the other to gain a
strategic advantage. There may very well be differences of approach
between this or that state, different conceptions of what the 'national
interest' is and how best to pursue it at a given moment, and different
conceptions of the ideal end-state to which they all strive. [But all of
them are locked in a competitive system of imperialism, ultimately
driven by the dynamics of capitalist competition.]{.underline}

#### NATO is a tool of U.S. imperialism -- increases U.S. military sales and provides excuses to maneuver armies

**Hassan 08** (Ghali Hassan is an independent writer living in
Australia. "NATO: A Tool Of U.S. Imperialism," 8/25/8,
https://countercurrents.org/hassan250808.htm)

The U.S.-controlled North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ([NATO) has lost
its purpose to continue as a defence alliance. However, its aggressive
expansion is endangering world peace]{.underline} and the survival of
the planet. Despite its irrelevant role, [NATO has become part of the
U.S. military]{.underline}. Instead of dismantling the once defence
alliance, the U.S. pushed to enlarge NATO and expand its boundaries. The
U.S. has lured most European nations, including former Warsaw Pact
members, the so-called "New Europe", to join its military. Poland,
Hungry and the Czech Republic joined in 1999; Bulgaria, Latvia,
Lithuanian, Estonia, Slovakia and Romania in 2004, others are waiting in
line. [Becoming a NATO member proves to be a profit bonanza for
U.S.-Israeli weapon industries]{.underline} and arm dealers. All new
[recruits into NATO are obliged to increase their "defence"
budgets]{.underline} to modernise and enlarge their military arsenals
[at the **expense** of **vital** public services]{.underline}. It is
important to bear in mind that the U.S.-NATO demands for expansion have
met with opposition from Russia, China -- with a legitimate concern
against unprovoked threat -- and nations such as Germany, the
Netherlands and France. Almost all new mini-dictators supported the
illegal U.S. aggression against the Iraqi people. They are in complete
complicity in the war crimes committed by the regime of George Bush
despite overwhelming majority of their citizens' opposition to U.S.
aggression. [From the criminal U.S. aggression against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia to the ongoing murderous occupation of
Afghanistan and Iraq, the new European armies have become U.S. foot
soldiers serving U.S. imperialist interests]{.underline}. Engineering
and using crisis in Europe and elsewhere, the U.S. cancelled the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM) in order to locate ABMs and to lure
more nations to sign up for the system, including Australia, South Korea
and Japan. Under the fraudulent pretext of defence against "rogue"
states, the [U.S. has just signed a "deal" with Poland to station on
Polish soil U.S. "interceptor missiles". The provocative deal
is]{.underline} seen by Russians as [a dangerous opportunity for the
U.S. to expand its military presence and threat across the
world.]{.underline} Poland hailed the deal as a counter to Russian
"threat". Of course Poland is fully aware that the missiles are against
Russia not Iran, as the U.S. continues to mislead the public. After
Poland, the U.S. is planning to build a twin anti-missile radar system
in the Czech Republic. Many Poles as well as Czechs are against the
deals and rightly believe their countries are becoming vassal states of
a dangerous U.S. militarism. Since the end of the so-called "Cold War",
the U.S. aim has always been a quest for imperialist domination of the
globe through U.S. militarism, including the establishment of U.S.
military bases in strategic areas of the world. The U.S. policy of
destabilising Russia and undermining Russia's integration with Europe is
aimed at controlling Eurasia's natural resources . The events of 9/11
provided the U.S. with a pretext to justify the U.S. war on Islam and a
global imperialist expansion. [It is hard to believe that the recent
unprovoked aggression by Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili against
the semi-independent district of South Ossetia wasn't engineered by the
U.S. ruling class in Washington]{.underline}. The aggression came at the
time when Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was at the Beijing
Olympics Opening Ceremony and President Dmitry Medvedev on holiday.
Georgian air force and heavy rocket and artillery indiscriminately
attacked the town of Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia at
midnight destroying schools, hospitals, homes, and even the University,
leaving much of the city in ruins. Hundreds of innocent civilians were
killed in the first hours of the attack. Saakashvili's U.S.-Israeli
trained Special Forces shot 10 Russian peacekeepers stationed there
under an international peace agreement. Saakashvili's aim was to take
control of South Ossetia and ethnically cleanse it of its majority
Russian inhabitants. Saakashvili thought that destroying Tskhinvali and
terrorising the population may go well with his plan to please
Washington and joins NATO as a new U.S. proxy army. Meanwhile, [the
aggression provides the U.S. and its vassals with a pretext to use
"humanitarian aid" deliveries to Georgia as cover for a military
build-up in the Black Sea]{.underline}. Whatever the outcome,
Saakashvili (like Bush) must be suffering from lack of rational
thinking. Saakashvili's aggression may have enhanced U.S. anti-Russian
propaganda, it has encouraged a rethinking among many European heavy
weight nations (who rightly see Russia as an important part of Europe),
that playing with fire close to Russia's border is not a very good idea.
With several European countries -- France, Germany, Netherlands,
Belgium, Spain, Italy, Norway, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg and Portugal
-- still have their doubts, Georgia's bid to join NATO may have suffered
a terminal setback as a result of Saakashvili's war crimes in South
Ossetia. Russia has a legitimate right to protect its citizens. Most
Ossetians are Russian citizens and do not want to be dominated by a
racist Georgia. Russia's response to Saakachvili's aggression was swift
and in full compliance with international laws. Saakashvili's army of
mercenaries -- trained and armed by the U.S. and Israel -- has suffered
a deserving humiliating defeat that should be a lesson to all those
"new" European vassals who think they can participate in U.S. war crimes
and count on U.S. help. Yet despite Georgia's unprovoked aggression,
[Western-Zionist mainstream media]{.underline} led by the BBC, CNN, NBC,
Fox News, New York Times and Washington Post [turned the aggressor into
a victim]{.underline}e. In a grotesque display of distortion and
dishonesty, Western media lauded Saakashvili as "democrat" defending
democracy against the "Russian Bear". Of course, forgotten are the
U.S.-staged rigged elections that brought Saakashvili to power,
Saakashvili's corrupt authoritarian rule, the banning of news
broadcasts, mass arrests of dissidents and Georgian police and masked
thugs firing on peaceful demonstrators in Tbilisi and the imposition of
marshal law. Playing on the prejudice and ignorance of their
populations, Western media is demonising Russia in order to create an
enemy and divert the public from ongoing war crimes perpetuated by
Western governments. The ongoing anti-Russian propaganda is reminiscent
of Nazis propaganda during World War II to manipulate the people and
create an anti-Russian sentiment. All of this is in accord with U.S.
quest for an imperialist control of the planet and the application of
Neocons-fascist ideology of global hegemonic control. Meanwhile, George
Bush (speaking on behalf of the "West") unashamedly condemned Russia's
legitimate response to Georgia's unprovoked aggression as
"disproportionate", and added: "\[It\] is unacceptable in the 21st
Century". The hypocrisy and double standards continued: "[This is not
1968 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia where Russia can threaten a
neighbour, occupy a capital, overthrow a government and get away with
it]{.underline}", ranted Condoleezza Rice, the tireless Secretary of
Travelling. Did Bush and his Rice forget the U.S. premeditated and
illegal invasion of and destruction of the Iraqi state, including the
murder of members of Iraq legitimate government? [Before criticising
Russia, the U.S. ruling class should take a hard look at U.S. history of
massive atrocities and serious war crimes committed around the
world.]{.underline} Indeed, the U.S. government is the only government
who get a way with any crime it commits. Hence, the U.S. ruling class
and their complicit media must be suffering from the contagious diseases
of moral bankruptcy and classic hypocrisy. The U.S. ruling class, the
Bush regime in particular, has no moral standing whatsoever to criticize
Russia for protecting Russian nationals and defending South Ossetia
against unprovoked aggression. After more than five years of murderous
Occupation, the Bush regime is directly responsible for the premeditated
killing of more than 1.3 million innocent Iraqi civilians. Hundreds of
thousands of Iraqi civilians are imprisoned and tortured on regular
basis, and at leas 5 million Iraqis have been displaced as refugees
living in appalling conditions. The entire sovereign nation of Iraq is
destroyed in a premeditated act of aggression justified by outright
lies. Moreover, despite the overwhelming majority of the Iraqi people's
opposition to the Occupation, the Bush regime refused to withdraw U.S.
troops and mercenaries from Iraq and end the murderous Occupation of
their nation. Finally, it is obvious that Western governments and their
mainstream media are demonising Russia even if Russia is not the
aggressor. As Sergei Lavrov, Russia\'s foreign minister told the media:
"NATO is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a
criminal regime - save a collapsing regime - and is taking a path to the
rearmament of the current leaders in Georgia". Saakashvili as
perpetrator of war crimes has become the victime by embarking on an
ill-advised act of aggression not dissimilar from U.S. recent acts of
aggression. World peace is greatly served by multilateralism and
international institutions without an aggressive U.S. military
expansion. [The transformation of NATO into a tool of U.S. imperialism
is endangering the survival of the planet.]{.underline}

It's unfortunate that Trump has focused on military spending,
jettisoning his original---and correct---notion that [NATO should be
obsolete]{.underline}. NATO was originally founded by the US and 11
other Western nations as an attempt to curb the rise of communism in
1949. Six years later, Communist nations, led by the Soviet Union,
founded the Warsaw Pact and through these two multilateral institutions
the entire globe became a field for the warring interests between the US
and the Soviets. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact was
disbanded, but NATO continued to exist and in fact expand\--growing from
its original 12 members to 29 member countries. [While claiming to be a
force of peace, it is clear from NATO's origin and continued actions
that the organization was created to expand Western influence using
military intervention]{.underline}. To this day, [NATO plays a key role
in military conflicts and commits human rights violations]{.underline}
around the globe under the pretense of peacebuilding. [In 1999, NATO
engaged in military operations without UN approval in Yugoslavia. Its
illegal airstrikes during the Kosovo War left hundreds of civilians
dead]{.underline}. [NATO has continued illegal military actions,
including attacks on civilians, torture of prisoners, and unauthorized
airstrikes, particularly in the Middle East region. NATO has been waging
war in Afghanistan since 2001. In 2011, it illegally invaded Libya,
destabilizing that country and creating a failed state. Even though
NATO's bombing of Libya caused masses of people to flee, NATO refused
aid to desperate migrants on the Mediterranean, causing thousands to
die]{.underline}. NATO's actions continue to destabilize the regions
they occupy, mainly through indiscriminate attacks that regularly kill
civilians. In more recent years, NATO has exacerbated Cold War-era
tensions as it has expanded to Russia's borders, despite earlier
promises not to move eastward. In response, tensions between Western
powers and Russia have been rising. This has led to multiple close calls
between military forces. It has also led both US and Russia to bolster
their nuclear arsenals, spurring a new arms race[. While organizations
like Amnesty International have accused NATO of war crimes, the
organization avoids accountability because of the shared power of its
member countries.]{.underline} It's impossible to say that NATO has
conformed to its original premise to increase freedom and security
around the globe. Instead, its role has been one of increasing
conflicts, particularly in the Middle East. In a world where people are
desperate to end war and are anxious to see a transfer of public funds
from the military to human needs , [NATO should indeed become a relic of
the past. Seventy years of militarism is enough.]{.underline}

#### NATO is a tool for neolib expansion through free market reforms

Sciences; "Security misread: A critical analysis of Ukraine\'s debate on

NATO as a Dutiful Agent of Neoliberalism While the IMF and World Bank
have been the most powerful advocates of neoliberal reforms in the
developing world over the last three decades, [NATO, WTO and the
European Central Bank joined the race to spread neoliberalism shortly
after the collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}. If Central and Eastern Europe‟s integration into
the Western Alliance‟s institutional framework was recently accomplished
and consolidated, Ukraine‟s reorientation has attained an advanced stage
in the economic and political spheres. Rachel Epstein argues that
[international institutions have had a significant influence on post
communist countries which have set themselves on **a free market reform
trajectory.**]{.underline}405 According to Epsein, the liberal, or as I
call it [neoliberal, worldview that currently prevails in the minds of
political and economic elites of Eastern and Central Europe is supported
"by a perception of where authority is grounded.]{.underline}" 406 For
most parts of Eastern and Central Europe**[, the transition to political
pluralism and free market enterprise "has been marked by a shift from
domestic sources of authority,]{.underline}** such as historical
experience and nationalist striving to international sources of
authority, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European
Union, and the Bretton Woods institutions."407 Epstein‟s claim that
"Domestic actors view international institutions as authoritative
sources of information and, as a consequence, seek their approbation,"
is very persuasive.408 [International institutions not only exercise
power over policymaking elites and consequently determine an
international orientation of states, they **also influence the "domestic
balance of power among groups in society**]{.underline}." 409
International institutions, whose main priority is to develop new policy
programs, persuade and shape the actions of domestic actors and should
be [viewed as active agents of domestic and global
change.]{.underline}410 While I realize that a number of different
theoretical approaches can be relevant for the evaluation of the role of
the state in today‟s internationalized world and extremely useful for
our understanding of how international institutions and regimes can
transform political dynamics, this section attempts only to highlight
the point that international organizations have promoted consensus
around the neoliberal policy manifestations in the countries undergoing
transition. More important, the point is that [multilateral institutions
play a key role in **regional and global processes of monitoring and
implementation** of free market-oriented knowledge structure while
disciplining alternative knowledge, ideas, policy options, and
practices.]{.underline} As previously mentioned, for Ukraine,
Euro-Atlantic integration means not only being a member of collective
security system, but fostering of economic development through a
neoliberal political and constitutional framework. [If for Walt,
Ukraine‟s participation in the transatlantic cooperative security
arrangement can increase the state‟s strength in relation to Russia and
enhance its regional influence,]{.underline} according to Brett Leed‟s
and Andrew Long‟s hypothesis, Euro-Atlantic integration means more for
Ukraine than just being an associate of military organization.411 [Leeds
and Long assert that military allies unconditionally have positive
economic consequences, and members of the collective security system are
expected to facilitate economic growth, development and
trade]{.underline}.412 For scholars**[, the security externality and the
reaction of commercial institutions are the main motives and
explanations for intensive engagement in mercantilism.]{.underline}**
[Leeds and Long conclude that "When firms feel secure]{.underline} that
conflict between their state and that of their trading partners is
unlikely to occur and that the states will work together to promote
commerce between their respective businesses, [they are more likely to
invest in trade."]{.underline}413 As determined by the liberalist
theoretical perspective of international relations, Ukraine‟s membership
in NATO will provide a well-balanced and secure framework for regional
and international economic activity, and thereby will encourage close
trading relationships and reassure the international community that
economic cooperation remains safe. Namely, the liberal view with its
ideas of complex interdependence and functionalism ascribes to NATO a
crucial role in driving states to collaborate in a much more widespread
way than they had done before. Liberal explanations for the
incorporation of Ukraine into NATO derive from the idea that all states
are bound to benefit from interdependency and cooperation. This argument
stresses that while NATO reduces the threat for nascent democracies and
thereby promotes and extends the liberal community, the Alliance also
continues to play a security role. Liberal scholars see NATO as one of
many multilateral mechanisms to promote security and transnational
cooperation through reinforcing democracy and free market economies. In
fact, my point is that the only arguments which demonstrate security
advantages for Ukraine joining NATO seem to rely more on particular
Wilsonian liberal internationalism or constructivist notions about the
constitutive role of alliances rather than realist conventional wisdom.
According to Epstein, countries who are not even members of the Alliance
yet, but have joined the path to its membership, already demonstrate
their devotion to Western political and economic models. Through the
Partnership for Peace, a program directed at creating trust between NATO
and non-members, a process of denationalization of defense planning and
foreign policy in majority of countries of Eastern and Central Europe
has already taken place.414 Furthermore, [while the partnership commits
to extend defense cooperation between a non-member state and the
Alliance, it pushes a cooperative non-member state to transform power
relations from an executive-led **model to a model of democratic
civil-military relations.**]{.underline}415 One of the main focuses of
[NATO has always been the establishment of "a system of check and
balances in which the executive, government, parliament, and
society]{.underline}, through the media and nongovernmental
organizations would share in oversight."416 Moreover, particular
transformations in defense will not only lead to further distributional
consequences, but signify a transformation of "previously contested
ideas into commonly held assumptions."417 It follows, therefore that
[NATO uses its membership requirements not only to regulate the behavior
of societies, but also to define new tasks, create new categories of
actors and shape social reality in ways that favor a market-oriented
approach]{.underline}. [Alexandra Gheciu‟s book NATO]{.underline} in the
"New Europe" The Politics of International Socialization After the Cold
War is an [analytical examination of NATO‟s role in building of
construction of Western liberal norms and practices in former Communist
states.]{.underline} While analyzing the practices of NATO in Eastern
and Central Europe, Gheciu argues that **[NATO has been deeply involved
in socializing "Central and Eastern European political, military, and
functional elites into adopting Western-defined liberal democratic norms
and building corresponding institutions in their
states."]{.underline}**418 Through NATO‟s involvement in the numerous
processes of domestic politics, the organization has "played an
important role in post-Communist efforts in Central and Eastern Europe
[to (re) draw boundaries between reasonable/unacceptable definitions of
national identity and interests"]{.underline}419 While Gheciu unifies a
great number of arguments that are useful for my study, the claim that
NATO has been deeply engaged in a relatively broad set of activities
aimed at projection of a particular kind of liberal state identity in
Central and Eastern Europe, "[while simultaneously rejecting alternative
norms and institutions as inherently flawed" is important.

### NATO Human Security

#### Even seemingly benign calls for NATO to focus on "human security" only serve to obfuscate the alliance's role in spreading militarism and securing a US led imperial order

[The NATO reflection group report has a patriarchy problem]{.underline}.
Given that NATO is primarily a military alliance, this is not
surprising. But for a report that is looking ahead for the next decade,
it offers retrogressive views not just on human security and the
so-called Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda, but also [in terms of
how it addresses concepts such as "cohesion" what it considers to be the
biggest threats to NATO, and how it thinks the alliance should best deal
with those challenges]{.underline}. Overall, the report embraces
patriarchal approaches to "security", dissention within NATO and where
the alliance should go from here. [The recommendations further entrench
NATO members in **a militarist pursuit of dominance**, rather than true
community and cooperation either internally or
internationally.]{.underline} NATO members should reject this approach.
The abolition of NATO would be the most straightforward way to allow its
individual members to pursue genuine collective security with others. In
the interim, NATO members that authentically care about peace, justice,
international law, human rights and dignity, and cooperation need to
renounce the violent masculinities1 espoused in this report, including
by rejecting nuclear weapons and working to remove all weapons of mass
destruction from NATO's doctrine. They could also withdraw from NATO and
adopt feminist foreign policies, finding common ground with other
members of the world community for the nonviolent pursuit of peace and
justice. NATO, WPS and human security A one-page section in the 67-page
report deals with "Human Security and Women, Peace and Security" (WPS).
These [subjects come across as an afterthought of the report's authors,
who were perhaps seeking to check the **'gender box' that** is
increasingly a staple of checklists within many intergovernmental
agencies.]{.underline} This suspicion deepens when reading the text, in
[which NATO both simultaneously positions itself as a progressive leader
in respecting "human dignity" while making it clear that any efforts
within these agenda items are **exclusively for public point-scoring**,
not for serious policy development.]{.underline} [The report urges NATO
members to promote the alliance's "work" on human security by including
it in public messaging, especially to the "younger
generation".]{.underline} It suggests NATO should ["leverage existing
partnerships with civil society organisations]{.underline}" in order to
"build a group of emissaries for its work in human security and in WPS,
including female role models from countries where NATO has made a
positive contribution". It goes on to assert, "The personal stories,
experiences, and engagement of such a group would provide NATO with a
strong asset in ongoing efforts to raise awareness of the Alliance's
constructive role in promoting stability and addressing drivers of
conflict" (p.43). Peace research perspectives on NATO 2030 18 February
2021 Note that [it doesn't suggest NATO actually address drivers of
conflict---just that it should spend more time telling people that it
does.]{.underline} However, [NATO does not address root causes of
conflict. **NATO members themselves drive many of the ongoing conflicts
in the world.**]{.underline} **[Their individual and collective policies
of militarism, and the violent masculinities these policies reflect and
further entrench, are part of the root causes of
conflict.]{.underline}** Rather than working within the human security
and WPS agendas in order to prevent conflict, or seek nonviolent,
non-militarised solutions to conflict, [NATO reflexively turns again and
again to weapons, war, aggression, and threats in order to promote and
protect its interests]{.underline}. The challenges posed by
institutionalising WPS The WPS agenda has, to a large extent, become
[about strategically instrumentalising women's participation in order to
legitimise existing practice.]{.underline} Academics Marie Bell and
Milli Lake have well-articulated this problem, noting that ["Adding
certain excluded groups into existing institutions will ultimately
reinforce the same patriarchal, capitalist, and militarist logics of
hierarchy and exclusion that denied those groups access to power in the
first place".]{.underline}2 While women's participation---and gender
diverse people---is imperative and should be automatic, the way that
[the WPS agenda]{.underline} has been implemented over the past twenty
years unfortunately [has reinforced rather than challenged or changed
the underpinnings of militarism throughout security discourse and
practice]{.underline}. [Rather than challenging the patriarchal
structures and systems that have created the militarised world
order]{.underline}, once inside these systems, **[most women tend to
actively maintain it in order to maintain their
positions]{.underline}**. Nor do many of these women believe they should
have to "carry the burden" of changing policies or structures. In a
study from New America about women's participation in the US nuclear
weapon complex, for example, several women interviewed felt they were
dismissed by male colleagues on the assumption that they would favour
weapon cuts or disarmament. They had to prove, as former NATO Deputy
Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller said she sought to do, that "women
aren't afraid of nuclear weapons".3 As feminist scholar Cynthia Enloe
says, "You can militarise anything, including equality".4 You can also
apparently whitewash anything, including NATO's role as an aggressor in
international politics. In its section on human security and WPS, the
reflection group's report asserts that "[emphasising the value of human
dignity and security differentiates NATO from authoritarian rivals and
terrorist groups, which are among the world's human rights
abusers"]{.underline} (p.43). Yet **[NATO members have led and been
involved in bombing raids that have killed civilians and destroyed
cities and towns leaving civilians without housing, hospitals, food,
schools, or basic water and sanitation]{.underline}**.5 **[NATO members
are also, for the most part, hostile towards or lacklustre about the
current international political process to end the use of explosive
weapons in populated areas]{.underline}**, which is essential for
protecting civilians and achieving human security.6 In keeping with this
position, [the report recommends that NATO continue to **prioritise
"military necessity" over protecting civilians**]{.underline}. [It
admits that NATO forces could perhaps improve in terms of their
"sensitivity to the need to protect vulnerable populations and
sites"]{.underline} (p.43), but **[falls far short of suggesting that
NATO stop bombing populated areas, or that its members stop leading wars
of aggression, carrying out extrajudicial killings through drone
strikes, or allowing their soldiers and military contractors to commit
war crimes with impunity.7]{.underline}** If NATO wants to legitimately
incorporate human security and WPS into its strategy, it cannot remain a
military alliance. **[Human security cannot be achieved through
militarism and violence.]{.underline}** It is built through equity,
justice and safety for all; through investments in housing, education,
food, water and sanitation, and environmental protection; it is built
through initiatives to end racism, sexism, homophobia and ableism.

### Realism

#### Realism's exclusive focus on nation-states and its belief in the universal rules governing their affairs masks the imperialist nature of international relations and re-entrenches Eurocentrism in IR

As a consequence, security studies and [IR lack a coherent]{.underline}
and developed **[body of inquiry on questions of empire]{.underline}**
(Barkawi and Laffey 2002). [There is little in the way of an ongoing
conversation traversing]{.underline} older and contemporary
[scholarship]{.underline} on which a review essay conventionally can
report. [This is a]{.underline}n astonishing but also [constitutive
absence]{.underline}. **[For many, the modern world took shape around
the imperial encounter between Europeans and the Americas, Africa, and
Asia]{.underline}** (Said 1993; Wolf 1997; Bayly 2004). From this
perspective, **[a social science of "international relations" that
failed to address empire and imperialism,]{.underline}** or in
significant measure orientate inquiry around hierarchy and domination,
**[is not adequate to the experiences and histories of most of the
peoples and places on the planet]{.underline}** (cf. Buzan and Little
2000). Alternatively, [such a social science is written by and for the
powerful]{.underline} (Hoffman 1977). **[IR]{.underline}** and security
studies scholars, **[and their]{.underline}** university departments,
research centers, **[thinktanks]{.underline}**, journals, and
publishers, **[are mostly located in the West]{.underline}**, and
chiefly in the US, **[shaping perspectives in manifold
ways]{.underline}** (cf. Tickner and Waever 2009). [Considering the
heavy traffic in the US between the academy and thinktanks,]{.underline}
policy planning staffs, and government, [there are power/knowledge
problems yet to be]{.underline} fully understood or
[confronted]{.underline} (Simpson 1998; Amadae 2003; Gilman 2003; Oren
2003; Laffey and Weldes 2008). Unlike anthropology, [IR]{.underline} and
security studies **[have not come to terms with their own implication in
imperial power]{.underline}** and what this might mean for how they
understand the world (Asad 1973; Fabian 1983). Postcolonial critiques of
Eurocentrism in social and political inquiry do not have wide currency
in the discipline (Chatterjee 1986; Chakrabarty 2000; Slater 2004;
Barkawi and Laffey 2006).¶ Of course, it is all in how one defines
"international relations." The absence of empire and hierarchy is
constitutive in that inquiry is oriented around sovereignty and anarchy
instead. [The central problematic in the discipline is that of a system
of]{.underline} independent wills, figured as [sovereign
states,]{.underline} relating to and [competing with one another in the
absence of higher authority]{.underline}. "None is entitled to command;
none is required to obey" (Waltz 1979:88). [This problematic requires
"units" that are "formally" alike,]{.underline} in that they are
sovereign entities, **[even if they differ in their relative
power]{.underline}** and capabilities. **[The inattention to hierarchy
is]{.underline}** principled and **[systematic]{.underline}**, not
inadvertent (cf. Lake 2009). [A consequence]{.underline} in IR and
security studies [is that Westphalian terms of reference
often]{.underline} occlude and **[distort imperial
relations]{.underline}**. One purpose of this essay is to reveal these
moments of misidentification and misconception, especially in the form
of broad suppositions at work in the literature, and in so doing to open
new spaces for research.¶ [The central focus of IR situates discussion
of imperialism]{.underline} and hierarchy outside the core of the
discipline, and [on its fringes where scholars from other disciplines
engage with IR and security studies literature.]{.underline} Similarly,
in respect of security studies in particular, [the focus is mostly on
major war between great powers]{.underline}, not "small wars" between
the strong and the weak. [When "small wars" are considered]{.underline},
as well as other conflicts in the global South, [inquiry is all too
often informed by sovereign conceptions of the international
system]{.underline}, as in many studies of civil war and in the
democratic peace literature (Licklider 1995; Ray 1995). In a framing
engendered by the idea of the sovereign state, "civil war" in the global
South is primarily conceived as an internal phenomenon (e.g., Holsti
1996:25--26). This is so despite the past and present role of former
imperial powers, the activities of international organizations, states,
and commercial enterprises, as well as the global economic relations
that help produce and sustain "civil wars" (Reno 1998; Duffield 2001;
Mamdani 2001; Nordstrom 2004; Gleditsch 2007). Alternatively, [much
literature on "counterinsurgency]{.underline}," "counterterror," [and
other conflicts involving Western powers is baldly written from the
perspective of "how to do it better]{.underline}"; that is, [from the
point of view of imperial power, a policy science for the
powerful]{.underline} (Pape 1996; Johnson and Mason 2008; cf. Al-Qaeda
n.d.; Mao 1937). **[Such studies are not generally placed within an
overall account of international hierarchy]{.underline}** or the long
run of imperial conflicts and histories. [Yet defeating indigenous armed
resistance and determining the conditions under which foreign peoples
are governed is the stuff of imperial power]{.underline}. So another
task for this essay is to situate existing literature on "small wars,"
"civil wars," and "low intensity conflict" within a framework of
imperialism and international hierarchy, rather than the formal
juridical categories of the sovereign state system.¶ **[Forgetting
empire is often a function of Eurocentrism]{.underline}**, of the
unreflective assumption of the centrality of Europe and latterly the
West in human affairs. **[In IR this often involves placing the great
powers at the center of analysis]{.underline}**, **[as the primary
agents in determining the fate of peoples. Too easily occluded here are
the myriad international relations of co-constitution, which together
shape societies]{.underline}** and polities in both the global North and
South. For how else would we be able to address the impact generated by
a war in far-off Vietnam on the US, and its subsequent role ever since
in shaping American society, politics, and foreign interventions?
Vietnam was neither the first nor the last "small war" to have such big
consequences, but understanding how and why requires an "imperial turn"
in IR (Doty 1996).

### Russia Threat 

#### The 1AC's claims of Russia as a security threat are means of legitimizing neoliberal power 

**Levytskyy '11**

(Andriy Levytskyy, DePaul University college for Liberal Arts and Social
Sciences; "Security misread: A critical analysis of Ukraine\'s debate on
NATO", DePaul University, 11/11,

DOA 6/21/22)//nm

The [Russian perception of the Atlantic Alliance]{.underline} and its
enlargement elicits an antagonistic reaction from Moscow and [is an
important factor in Ukraine‟s desire to join NATO]{.underline}. In the
minds of the Russian political elite as well as the average Russian, the
prospect of a new wave of NATO expansion to include Ukraine indicates [a
"continuation of the policy aimed at pushing Russia out of its
traditional spheres of influence, and a move that signifies Russia‟s
encirclement with international protectorates or mandate territories of
a Bosnia-Kosovo type."]{.underline}117 For Russia, on the basis of the
historical assumptions, [the process of NATO‟s eastward enlargement
seems to be motivated **by the Western intentions to exploit Russia‟s
weakness and should not be viewed as a peaceful process.**]{.underline}
In fact, a strong opposition to the idea of Ukrainian membership in NATO
and the Alliance‟s continuous expansion all the way to Russia‟s borders
is [a clear sign of NATO‟s dismissal of Russian interests]{.underline},
and therefore **[evokes a harsh reaction from the Russian political
establishment.]{.underline}** If the inclusion of three Baltic countries
heightened Russia‟s sense of isolation, the Ukrainian accession to NATO,
according to the average Russian, would be [decisive evidence of Western
attempts to isolate and subordinate Russians at the same
time.]{.underline}118 The point is that while Western World perhaps
views NATO as being transformed into a political organization, in
Russia**[, the Alliance is considered in purely military
terms.]{.underline}** From the Russian perspective, plans to incorporate
Ukraine into the Western military alliance along with the American
proposal to deploy anti-ballistic missile (ABM) components in Eastern
Europe are [grounded on realist reasoning and are targeted against
Russia, regardless of whether there is an authoritarian or democratic
form of government]{.underline}. Western behavior has been interpreted
as aggressive, and an extension of NATO‟s influence as a threat to
Russia‟s security Within Russian society it is generally accepted that
the process of NATO enlargement is connected to Western perceptions of
Russia as being a potential enemy.119 Such an assumption is based on
anti-Russian opinions, prevalent mostly in the United States and Eastern
Europe, which are rooted in the past dating back hundreds of years, and
which since the end of the Cold War have continued to be full of
hostility.120 [The growth of Russia‟s defense spending, its attempts to
preserve its traditional sphere of influence and its elimination of
domestic opposition have **contributed to an image of Russia as a
potential threat.**]{.underline} This view of Russia as a source of
danger was recently reinforced by the depiction of war in Georgia by the
Western mass-media. While rejecting Georgia‟s role in starting the
conflict along with ignoring the importance of the U.S. material support
to Saakashvili\'s regime, Western journalists, according to historian
Herbert Bix, "Fostered Russophobic sentiment by disseminating completely
one-sided war news, **[demonizing Russia as the evil
aggressor,]{.underline}** and championing „democratic‟, peace-loving
Georgia."121 While realizing that it is not possible to completely grasp
the objectivity and being willing to adjust myself to the relativity of
truth claims, I tend to agree with this viewpoint. Moreover, this debate
clearly demonstrates how power relations contribute to the formation of
certain knowledge and leads to conclude that [perceptions play a
critical role in the issue of Ukraine‟s incorporation into
NATO]{.underline}. As seen from Moscow, a new round of hostility towards
Russia clearly confirms that the West‟s struggle against communism and
the Soviet Union had not ideological, but exclusively geopolitical
meaning. This viewpoint finds its support in different schools of
thought regarding the strategic geopolitical importance of the area of
the former Soviet bloc precisely to the United States. Nevertheless, to
provide a clear and a strong explanation for NATO‟s engagement with the
countries of the former Soviet Union, it is necessary to refer to the
geopolitical views of one of the prominent advocates of NATO‟s
membership for Ukraine which is motivated by the resentment toward
Russia. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security advisor in the
Carter [administration, has portrayed Russia‟s exercise of its influence
on neighboring states as a extension of uncivilized and "proto-imperial
approach", and has argued for the adoption of the Western policy of
"**geopolitical pluralism"** that should seek as its primary objective
**to guarantee that Russia** **would not become a "mighty supranational
state** and a truly global power]{.underline}."122 According to
Brzezinski, the political, military and economic integration of the
newly independent states of Central and Eastern Europe should be a basic
strategy of the Western geopolitical approach.123 Furthermore, in terms
of Russian-Ukrainian relations, Brzezinski confirms this mode of
thinking by arguing that "Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an
empire, but with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated, Russia
automatically becomes an empire."124 Therefore, as it can be seen from
this realist analysis of the role and place of once-Soviet states in
Europe, it is clear that NATO‟s engagement with Ukraine is a part of a
broader policy directed to oppose Russian interests in the region.
Unfortunately, [being great supporters of Ukraine‟s NATO membership, the
majority of Western thinkers and policymakers such as Brzezinski simply
ignores both the real interests of ordinary Ukrainians]{.underline} and
their everyday reality and has been consciously pushing Ukraine into a
culturally driven conflict with Russia.125

## Impact/Turns Case/RC

### US-China War

#### Biden's imperialist expansions causes nuclear war between China and the US

**Damon '21** (Andre Damon, Writer and editor for the World Socialist
Web Site specializing in geopolitics and economics, March 16^th^ 2021
"US imperialism puts China in its sights" World Socialist Web Site,
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/03/17/pers-m17.html)

Behind the backs of the American and world population[, the Biden
administration and the US military are preparing an escalation of
military tensions against China with incalculable
consequences.]{.underline} Earlier this month, the Japanese Nikkei news
service published excerpts from the Pentagon's Pacific Deterrence
Initiative, which calls for stationing offensive missiles, previously
banned by the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, along a
string of densely populated islands that includes Japan, Taiwan and the
Philippines[. To fund this initiative, the Pentagon requested an annual
Pacific budget]{.underline}, in the words of Nikkei, [of "\$4.7
billion]{.underline}, which is more than double the \$2.2 billion
earmarked for the region in fiscal 2021." Against the backdrop of these
plans, [US Secretary of State]{.underline} Antony Blinken and Secretary
of Defense Lloyd Austin [visited]{.underline} Japan this week[,
threatening to "push back" against "aggression" by China]{.underline}.
While Blinken and other US officials habitually speak of Chinese
aggression, it has been the US under Obama, Trump and [now Biden that
has aggressively confronted China in the Indo-Pacific to prevent any
challenge to American global hegemony]{.underline}. In a brief and
tightly choreographed press conference, the two US officials and their
Japanese counterparts, together with the vetted press, ignored the
burning question: 75 years after American bombers obliterated Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, were their policies exposing the people of Japan and China
to a similar fate? While the question was not directly addressed, the
answer was clear. "[We reconfirmed the strong commitment of the United
States regarding defense of Japan, using all types of US forces,
including nuclea]{.underline}r," said Japanese Foreign Minister
Toshimitsu Motegi. Even as more than 1,000 people die from COVID-19
every single day in the United States, and the disease surges around the
world[, the US is preparing for a conflict that risks incalculable human
suffering.]{.underline} Joining this offensive is the United Kingdom,
with the highest COVID-19 death rate of the major European countries,
which announced Tuesday a massive expansion of its nuclear weapons
program, calling China a "major threat." It is not COVID-19, but China
that the US has planted firmly in its sights. As Blinken made clear,
"Several countries present us with serious challenges, including Russia,
Iran, North Korea... but the challenge posed by China is different.
China is the only country with the economic, diplomatic, military and
technological power" to "challenge" the United States. On March 10, Adm.
Philip Davidson, commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, told a Senate
Armed Services Committee hearing he believes that China is likely to
invade Taiwan within the next six years. "I think the threat is manifest
during this decade, in fact, in the next six years," Davidson said.
Given that the United States has, in the words of Defense Secretary
Austin, "commitments to support Taiwan's ability to defend itself," to
predict that China will invade Taiwan within the next six years is to
predict a major Sino-American war within that same time period. To this
end, Davidson stressed, "We absolutely must be prepared to fight and win
should competition turn to conflict." What would the world look like if
"competition turned to conflict?" A preview of this reality is provided
by Adm. James Stavridis, former supreme allied commander of NATO, who
published a book titled 2034: A Novel of the Next World War just one day
before Davidson's comments. T**[he novel depicts a nuclear conflict
between the United States and China]{.underline}**, involving the total
annihilation of major cities on both sides. Stavridis writes that after
an American nuclear attack on Shanghai, one of the largest cities in the
world, "These many months later the city remained a charred, radioactive
wasteland. The death toll had exceeded thirty million. After each of the
nuclear attacks international markets plummeted. Crops failed.
Infectious diseases spread. Radiation poisoning promised to contaminate
generations. The devastation exceeded... capacity for comprehension."
[The American survivors of a Chinese nuclear attack on San Diego are
left to live in "wretched camps,]{.underline}" where "cyclical outbreaks
of typhus, measles, and even smallpox often sprouted from the unbilged
latrines and rows of plastic tenting." What is most striking is the
contrast between these graphic depictions of mass death and the imminent
danger of what Stavridis calls a "world war," and the degree to which
the public is unaware that these preparations are even underway. How
many people in the US know that the United States is preparing to deploy
offensive missiles in highly populated areas off the Chinese coast? And
how many people in Japan? The evening news and major newspapers are
silent on these war preparations, even as they relentlessly and falsely
demonize China. Leading the charge has been the Washington Post, owned
by Amazon oligarch Jeff Bezos. In an editorial on March 14, the Post
accused China of "genocide" against its Muslim population, echoing the
declarations of the Trump and Biden administrations. The Post demanded
that the United States withdraw from the 2022 Winter Olympics in
Beijing, declaring that to attend "when the Xi regime is actively
seeking to destroy a group of more than 12 million people would be
unconscionable." At the same time, the Post has continued its campaign
to falsely assert that COVID-19 could have been created in a Chinese
laboratory. It condemns the findings of the World Health Organization,
which declared that, in the words of the Post, the "laboratory
hypothesis was 'extremely unlikely' and would not be further studied."
In response, the Post declares that the "WHO needs to start over" and
consider "both the zoonotic and laboratory hypotheses." [These efforts
to demonize China are sheer propaganda. A major aim is to divert
mounting social tensions outward toward an "external" enemy." The 20th
century's horrific wars were prepared with such propaganda, designed to
obscure the real war aims of capitalist governments. In the 21st
century, the costs of a major war are greater than ever]{.underline}. In
the 20 years of this century, despite perpetual wars and proxy
conflicts, there has never been a full-scale clash between nuclear-armed
states. But exactly such a war is threatened by the massive US military
buildup against China. [The workers of the United States and China have
nothing to gain from such a horrific conflict. It is they, not the
generals and politicians, who would bear the cost]{.underline}. If a
relapse to the bloodshed of the 20th century is to be avoided, it is the
working class that must prevent it. [The fight against imperialism and
the danger of a new world war must be developed as a revolutionary
movement of workers throughout the world, in opposition to the homicidal
policies of the ruling elites and the entire capitalist
system]{.underline}

#### US imperialism results in cold war tensions with china that could spill over

**Singh '18** (Ajit Singh, journalist and graduate student. He is a
contributing author to Keywords in Radical Philosophy and Education:
Common Concepts for Contemporary Movements, April 9^th^ 2018, "China's
rise threatens U.S. imperialism, not American people" MROnline,
<https://mronline.org/2018/04/09/chinas-rise-threatens-u-s-imperialism-not-american-people/>)

[Washington's hostility towards Beijing is rooted in the foundation of
modern U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. The fall of the Soviet Union in
1991 and end of the Cold War, ushered in an era during which the [U.S.
has sought to establish unipolar global dominance.]{.underline}
Explicitly outlined in a 1992 Defense Policy Guidance paper authored
under neoconservative Paul Wolfowitz, the principal objective of U.S.
foreign policy in this period has been "to prevent the re-emergence of a
new rival" capable of challenging U.S. aspirations for global hegemony.
In the quarter-century since, the [U.S. has aggressively pursued this
aim, engaging in endless wars, "regime change" efforts, and military
build-ups around the world, now operating over 900 military bases
globally. Despite these most destructive efforts, the U.S. has been
unable to stop China's momentous rise,]{.underline} which has emerged as
the primary obstacle to U.S. aims for unipolar dominance. Although
Washington has sought regime change in Beijing ever since the socialist
revolution of 1949, the U.S. has generally pursued a strategy of
"containment through engagement" following the normalisation of
bilateral relations in the 1970s. In part, [Washington had hoped that
China's economic reform and the fall of the Soviet Union would lead to
political reform in Beijing and the abandonment of Communist Party
leadership and socialism with Chinese characteristics, in favour of
Western-oriented neoliberalism. History has confirmed that China has no
such intention]{.underline}. Recognizing its own declining leverage and
that China will not become "more like us", Washington is attempting to
launch a new Cold War against China. [The identification of China as the
primary target of U.S. foreign policy originated during the Obama era
with the "Asia pivot" seeking to encircle China, shifting 60 percent of
U.S. naval assets to Asia by 2020.]{.underline} As Secretary of State,
Hillary Clinton argued that the U.S. must reorient the focus of its
foreign policy from the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific to ensure
"continued American leadership well into this century." The developments
under Trump, mark an escalation of this bipartisan strategy. The
unipolar-multipolar struggle The importance of U.S.-China relations
cannot be overstated, with the two countries at the core of a broader
unipolar-multipolar struggle over the shape of the international order.
While the U.S. seeks to secure global dominance, China's rise is central
to a multipolarisation trend, in which multiple centres of power are
emerging to shape a negotiated, more democratic world. [China's
political orientation has been fundamentally shaped by its history of
subjugation to foreign powers during its "century of humiliation" and
anti-imperialist struggle for national liberation.]{.underline} Under
the leadership of the Communist Party, China has always identified
itself as part of the Third World or global South and the collective
struggle of formerly colonized and oppressed nations against the global
inequality wrought by imperialism. Under the banner of "South-South
cooperation", China continues to champion this collective struggle
today, promoting greater say for developing countries in global
governance and the construction of a rules-based international order in
place of the unilateral actions of major powers, in particular the U.S.
[More than mere rhetoric, China provides crucial investment,
infrastructure construction, technology transfers, debt forgiveness, and
diplomatic support to developing countries. Most importantly, unlike the
U.S. and West which engage in destructive foreign interventions, China
abides by the principle of non-interference]{.underline} in the internal
affairs of other countries and does not impose conditions on its
relations. China's respect for the self-determination of other countries
has made it an indispensable partner for nations resisting foreign
domination and pursuing independent development, including Cuba,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Zimbabwe, Syria, Iran, and North Korea. It is for
this reason that the late Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro declared in
2004 that "China has objectively become the most promising hope and the
best example for all Third World countries ... an important element of
balance, progress and safeguard of world peace and stability."
Venezuelan foreign minister Jorge Arreaza echoed these sentiments last
December, saying "Thank God humanity can count on China," as his country
faces sanctions, economic sabotage, and threats of regime change from
the U.S. [Contributing to the declining global authority of the U.S,
China's international relations have prompted Washington to cynically
accuse China of fostering dependency in Africa and being an "imperial
power" towards Latin America]{.underline}. In fact, rather than behaving
in a predatory manner, China provides sorely needed funding, on
favorable terms, to African borrowers, and as we have seen above China
supports Latin America's struggle against imperialism. That China is
praised by fiercely independent nations of the global South and faces
such charges from the U.S.---the most powerful empire in
history---reveals the absurdity of such claims. [Anxious about its own
decline, the U.S. seeks to both drive a wedge between China and the
South, and also restrict the right of developing nations to choose their
own partners and path.]{.underline} [China has demonstrated that its
rise is compatible with the self-determination of other
nations---whether capitalist or socialist; what it comes into
contradiction with is U.S. imperialism.]{.underline} It is important to
recognize that U.S. hostility towards China is not simply a product of
narrow competition with the Asian power, it is a resistance to the
empowerment of the global South and democratization of international
relations. [China is the primary target of U.S. imperialism because of
its strategic importance at the heart of the world multipolarisation
trend.]{.underline}

[The Sino--U. S. struggle for high-tech supremacy]{.underline} and the
U. S. plan to torpedo China's state-initiated program, "Made in China
2025," which aimed to push the Chinese economy up the global value
chain, is suspected to be the real reason behind the Huawei prosecution
(Tabeta and Kawanami, 2018) and for the trade war (Zhou and Wang, 2019).
President Donald Trump, for example, has frankly admitted when speaking
to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Ajit Pai, "We cannot
allow any other country to out-compete the United States in this
powerful industry of the future. We [are leading by so much in so many
different industries]{.underline} of that type, and we just can't let
that happen. The race to 5G is a race America must win" (U. S. White
House, 2019). The U. S.' attempted takedown of Huawei [therefore
signifies a larger battle for high-tech supremacy between the two
countries:]{.underline} one is positioned as the Lockean heartland
hegemon and the other as a Hobbesian contender state challenging a
weakened American hegemon (van der Pijl, 1998). [The technology war and
the trade war have unveiled a larger geopolitical and geoeconomic
contest]{.underline}. [The United States' Pivot to Asia and China's Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI) are two grand strategies being used to counter
one another.]{.underline} The Pivot to Asia is a foreign strategy first
developed under the Obama administration **[to target the emerging China
by shifting the geographical focus from the Middle East to East
Asia]{.underline}**, [which constitutes economic as well as]{.underline}
86 SCIENCE & [SOCIETY political--military means]{.underline}. The U. S.
government has planned to deploy 60% of its naval power to Asian and
Pacific regions by 2020 (Shifrinson, 2018; Wang, 2016). The [military
reinforcement parallels arms sales to Taiwan, ongoing navy presence in
South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, soaring military budgets, and
improving state relations and deepening military cooperation with
China's neighboring countries]{.underline}. The economic arm, in
contrast, has been exercised in a less coherent but increasingly
forceful way with the regime change from Obama to Trump[. The
Trans-Pacific Partnership]{.underline} (TPP) previously constituted an
essential part of the Pivot to Asia, which, by building one of the most
massive free trade zones in history, [was also seen by the United States
and its allies as a geopolitical weapon to curb China's
rise]{.underline} (Harvey, 2018, 161). The TPP therefore aimed to
exclude rather than to engage China (de Graaff and van Apeldoorn, 2018;
Yu, 2017). Robinson (2017) cannot be more mistaken when citing the TPP
as a victory of transnational capital rather than an indicator of an
escalated Sino--U. S. geopolitical struggle. The TPP was dropped by the
Trump administration and yet the Sino--U. S. geopolitical struggle did
not cease thereafter; instead, it has been carried out on other fronts,
which involves more head-to-head combat. [The mounting trade war and
technology war (with Huawei being at the center of the storm) are
important examples of the increasingly naked confrontation]{.underline}.
Even though the Pivot to Asia is not a new invention but more a
continuation of the long-term U. S. policies to engage and
simultaneously to contain China (Rachman, 1996; Wang, 2016), it does
show signs of growing [hawkishness in the U. S.' China policy: from a
rather minimal containment approach to comprehensive
containment]{.underline} (Etzioni, 2016). Similarly, China's BRI
(complemented by the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank \[AIIB\]) was launched with both economic and
political--military ambitions. The BRI project was first proposed by
Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 with the sequential foundation of
the AIIB to allocate support funds for the project (Yu, 2017). It can be
seen as a new development as well as a continuation of China's previous
efforts --- with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership, for instance --- to deepen its
geopolitical and geoeconomic influence (Womack, 2013; Yu, 2017). On the
one hand, the BRI is aimed to cope with the country's economic
challenges, such as overcapacity, growing energy dependence, and
economic slowdown, by GLOBALIZATION AND TRANSNATIONAL CAPITAL 87
reconstructing the ancient (land and maritime) Silk Roads that allow
Chinese capital and products to go westward: a land road traversing
through central Asia and the Middle East to reach Europe, and a sea
route spanning the South China Sea through the Indian Ocean to the
Mediterranean (Shambaugh, 2018). Such an economic corridor is expected
to include over 60 countries and regions and "is believed to be the
world's most promising economic zone" (Wang, 2016, 456), which would act
as a counterbalance to the TPP. On the other hand, the BRI was also
launched with a political-- military objective: to act against the
geopolitical dimension of the Pivot to Asia by expanding China's
regional influence and deepening economic integration with its
neighboring countries through infrastructure building and cross-border
trade (Shambaugh, 2018[). Infrastructure modernization projects that
link other Asian countries with China will foster not only economic
interconnections **but also political exchanges**]{.underline}, which
can help reiterate China's win-win notion that stresses the country's
peaceful rise (Womack, 2013). The BRI therefore is rooted as part of
China's geopolitical strategy to renovate relations with its neighbors
that deteriorated over the past decade (Wang, 2016; Yu, 2017). At the
least, it is hoped to ameliorate the tensions and concerns regarding
China's rapid military expansion, including its island building in the
South China Sea which is also claimed by other countries, ballooning
defense budgets, ambitious navy modernization project, and threat of
using armed force against Taiwan.

#### US imperialism driven to constrain China's sovereign equality requires increasing nuclear arsenal and encircling the territory to assert hegemonic dominance---that explodes to war

[China's Third Revolution]{.underline} and the U.S.-Led Global
Counterrevolution In his October 18, 2017, report to the Nineteenth
National Congress of the CPC, [Xi stated]{.underline} that "the [Chinese
nation]{.underline}, which since modern times began had endured so much
for so long \[an allusion to the Opium Wars and the Century of
Humiliation\], [has achieved a tremendous transformation: it has stood
up, become better off, and grown in strength; it has come to embrace the
brilliant prospects of
rejuvenation]{.underline}."[74](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en74)
For those aware of the history of the People's Republic of China, it was
clear that Xi was speaking of the entire revolutionary process of
national rejuvenation. Mao famously declared that, with the Chinese
Revolution, China had stood up. The Deng Xiaoping era, often referred to
as the second era in the process of national rejuvenation, was just as
clearly about China becoming better off, [through rapid economic
development and integration within the capitalist world
economy]{.underline}. The New Era, in the period of Xi's leadership, has
been directed toward [constructing a strong, self-sufficient, and
sustainable Chinese system]{.underline}, aimed at "building a moderately
prosperous society in all respects" by 2021, and "of moving on to
all-out efforts to build a great modern socialist country" by
2049.[75](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en75)
Each stage in the Chinese Revolution has meant a major shift in the
revolutionary process, so that the Mao, Deng, and Xi periods are
sometimes referred to as China's First, Second, and Third
Revolutions.[76](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en76)
The "principal contradiction" in the New Era (or Third Revolution), the
surmounting of which is necessary if China is to achieve its objectives,
according to Xi, is the "unbalanced" or uneven and thus "inadequate"
nature of Chinese development, characteristic of the capitalist growth
model. This is manifested in deepening class inequality, divisions
between rural and urban areas, promotion of economic development at the
expense of cultural development, and an unsustainable human relation to
the
environment.[77](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en77)
Hence, a socialist-motivated shift toward greater economic equality,
national self-sufficiency, ecological civilization, rural
revitalization, cultural development, and the forging of a "dual
circulation" model (designed to reduce China's dependence on foreign
markets and technology) are all seen as crucial to China's emergence as
a "great modern socialist
society."[78](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en78)
The CPC leadership has continued to define China as "the world's largest
developing country," albeit one in "the primary stage of socialism,"
thus emphasizing its direct connections to the Global South of which it
sees itself a part. Its official international stance is dictated by the
"five principles of peaceful coexistence," defined as: (1) mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, (2) mutual
nonaggression, (3) mutual noninterference in each other's internal
affairs, (4) equality and mutual benefit, and (5) peaceful
coexistence.[79](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en79)
[Although China as an emerging global power has been increasingly
accused of setting a new agenda and seeking to overturn the existing
rules-based international order]{.underline} imposed by the core
capitalist states, this, rather than presaging anarchy or "might makes
right," as indicated by Blinken at the March 18 [bilateral meetings, has
largely taken the form of **a strong defense** of the concept **of
sovereign equality**]{.underline}, which necessarily goes against the
structure of the existing imperial
system.[80](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en80)
The path forward in China's Third Revolution will not of course be easy,
and what Xi has referred to as the "principal contradiction" in the form
of uneven development is evident in vast struggles taking place at all
levels in the society---and in China's external relations. [It would not
be an exaggeration to say that China's Third Revolution has been greeted
by the United States and the other core capitalist powers with **a
combination of disbelief, shock, and anger**.]{.underline} Unaccustomed
to thinking historically and dialectically, relying on mere formalistic
frames of analysis, and believing in the inevitable triumph of
capitalism, **[the dominant ideology in the West has been one quite
literally of "the end of
history]{.underline}**."[81](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en81)
[The idea that China's sovereign project would eventually lead to a
critical challenge to, rather than absorption within, the existing
capitalist and imperialist order was thus scarcely entertained in
Washington.]{.underline} As Kurt M. Campbell, former assistant secretary
of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs in the Barack Obama
administration, and Ely Ratner, Biden's nominee for assistant secretary
of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, wrote in "The China
Reckoning: How Beijing Defied American Expectations" in Foreign Affairs
in February 2018, [the notion that "U.S. power and hegemony" would fail
to "mold China to the United States' liking" was until recently
completely foreign to the U.S. establishment]{.underline}. Even more
shocking was the discovery that China's New Era, associated with Xi,
would begin to look in many ways more like the revolutionary China of
Mao than the reform era of
Deng.[82](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en82)
[The **enraged response of the U.S.** power elite to China's undeterred
pursuit of its own sovereign project **has been to launch the New Cold
War centered on China**]{.underline} (also encompassing its allies like
Russia and Iran). This is [now seen in U.S. ruling class circles **as a
new war for hegemony**]{.underline}---though minus any genuine
historical analysis, which would require an honest assessment of
imperialism past and present. Rather, Allison's Destined for War, which
directly influenced Biden, drew its supposed historical frame, not from
a conception of the capitalist world system, or [from an understanding
of the imperial imposition of unequal treaties on China]{.underline}.
Instead, [it turned to a transhistorical law of conflict associated
**with the "realist" perspective on international
relations**,]{.underline} derived from Thucydides, the ancient Greek
historian of the Peloponnesian War, who wrote in 411 BCE: "It was the
rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war
inevitable."[83](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en83)
In contrast, from a Marxian perspective, any meaningful assessment of
hegemonic transition in the context of the modern world must be seen as
a product of the internal dynamics of the capitalist world economy,
which has been characterized throughout its history by the imperialism
of the core directed at the periphery and by periodic wars over imperial
hegemony: [the only "answer" that the capitalist system is capable of
providing to the question of world
power]{.underline}.[84](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en84)
Reflecting this logic[, the New Cold War]{.underline} on China initiated
by the United [States seeks to draw together the leading imperial
capitalist states in a global alliance aimed at binding Beijing,
together with its allies and the entire periphery of the capitalist
system, to the rules-based international order controlled by the triad,
while at the same time keeping the Chinese economy, the motor of world
economic growth, going]{.underline}. China, it is recognized, is too big
simply to be conquered, and too big economically to be allowed to fail.
[What is required, therefore, according to the ruling Washington
Consensus, **is a counterrevolution unleashed by the reigning powers**
directed at reimposing a new global set of unequal treaties on
China]{.underline}, along with the bulk of the developing world. The
object is less to contain than to constrain China. **[Ultimately, such a
strategy is to be backed up by military force.]{.underline}** This was
what Bill Clinton's secretary of state Madeleine Albright was [to call
"assertive multilateralism]{.underline}." For Hillary Clinton, speaking
at Chatham House on May 6, 2021, it is essential in this context [for
the United States to "take back the means of production]{.underline}"
from China [to ensure that the latter is kept in a perpetual subaltern
state]{.underline}.**[[85](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en85)
To say that these conditions puts the world's population in an era of
almost unprecedented danger would be an understatement]{.underline}**.
**[No New Cold War can take place without a nuclear arms race and
increased danger of thermonuclear war]{.underline}**. [China, whose
nuclear warheads are in the low 200s]{.underline}, **[compared to the
1,400 deployed nuclear warheads of the United States,]{.underline}** is
[seeking to double its number of warheads by 2030]{.underline}. [The
United States, for its part, is currently committed to spending \$500
billion]{.underline} on its nuclear forces alone over the next decade,
\$50 billion a year. This includes \$100 billion on its so-called
Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, a land-based nuclear missile system
designed to replace the aging Minuteman III Intercontinental Ballistic
Missile system. T[he Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent missiles will be
capable of traveling six thousand miles with greater throw weight and
accuracy, each one carrying a warhead twenty times as powerful as the
bomb dropped on
Hiroshima.]{.underline}[86](https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/the-new-cold-war-on-china/#en86)
The world survived the Cold War. **[We do not know if it will survive

### US-Russia NW

#### Capitalism generates resource competition that makes global war inevitable- specifically causes US-Russian conflict that goes nuclear

**Williams in 2022**

Maynard Keynes, and Anwar Shaikh; A Critique of Crisis Theory;

According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the "collective
West" launched a "total hybrid war" against Russia. The shooting war in
the Donbass (1) and Ukraine is only part of it. [Thousands of dead
Ukrainian and Russian soldiers are bad enough. But this is only the
beginning of the story. The disruption of trade as well as grain and
fertilizer production]{.underline} --- of which both Russia and Ukraine
are critical suppliers --- [is threatening to create global food
shortages]{.underline} and, in some areas, full-scale famine. Food
shortages bring death to people of the Global South and beyond. Deaths
occur not only from starvation but also from weakening immune systems
making them more susceptible to COVID and other infectious diseases. But
the biggest threat is that it could end in nuclear war[. What has led to
this dangerous]{.underline}, disastrous [state of affairs]{.underline}
in the relationship between the two powers?¶ Anyone who has taken
college-level economic courses has run into the theory that claims that
comparative advantage, not absolute advantage, rules international
trade. This theory holds that free trade is equally in the interests of
all nations regardless of their degree of economic development. Yet the
governments of underdeveloped nations showing any independence from
imperialism often follow policies neoclassical economists call
neo-mercantilist. Comparative advantage supporters claim that such
policies are harmful to both developing and developed countries alike.¶
Left-wing economists who reject neoclassical economics generally support
neo-mercantilist policies for developing countries. These economists
learned the theory of comparative advantage from neoclassical teachers.
But, unlike orthodox neoclassical economists, they admit the law of
comparative advantage doesn't work out as the textbooks say it should.¶
Left economists claim that if free competition genuinely prevailed,
comparative advantage in international trade would work for the benefit
of all nations. But they and other heterodox economists believe the
growth of capitalist monopoly negates those laws. Anwar Shaikh rejects
this analysis. He says monopoly isn't necessary to explain why
comparative advantage doesn't work the way it is supposed to. He says
comparative advantage does not govern international trade under
capitalism at all. He also believes the capitalist with the lowest costs
wins the battle of competition in the home market as well as in
international trade and therefore absolute advantage prevails in
international trade as well as domestic.¶ Shaikh doesn't agree with
Lenin's theory that imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism. He
says the whole history of capitalism is imperialism. I have a lot to
cover before examining Shaikh's view that a monopoly stage of capitalism
does not exist. I will cover this at a later date.¶ [The concrete
history of capitalism is that of wars between capitalist
nation-states]{.underline}. Before Lenin developed his theory of
imperialism, Marx and Engels used another concept, that of commercial
wars. From Lenin's point of view, [modern imperialist wars are a special
kind of commercial war.]{.underline} We are not interested in the
special case of modern imperialism based on monopoly capitalism. [We
want to know why wars occur throughout capitalism's
history]{.underline}.¶ Some eras have seen more commercial wars than
others. These more peaceful eras are marked by the domination of one
powerful capitalist nation. The period between 1815 and 1914 was an era
of domination by Britain. Another relatively peaceful era is the era
since 1945. This was marked by the domination of the United States. This
relative peace now threatens to come to an end.¶ [Even in relatively
peaceful eras, wars between capitalist nations of various degrees of
capitalist development never stopped. Are these wars]{.underline}, big
or small[, the result of evil leaders]{.underline} like Adolf Hitler, or
more recently, George W. Bush? Bush ordered the invasion of capitalist,
though non-imperialist, Iraq. [Or are wars of capitalist countries the
result of false political and economic policies,]{.underline} such as
those pursued by France and Britain toward defeated Germany after World
War I?¶ If false policies and evil leaders are to blame for wars there
is hope the capitalist state can learn from history and avoid policies
giving rise both to evil leaders and wars. [If wars are the result of
capitalist production combined with the nation-state, there is little
hope of ending wars between them as long as they continue to
exist]{.underline}. [The current state of relations of the United States
and NATO with capitalist Russia makes a correct answer to this question
urgent]{.underline}.¶ If wars between capitalist states are not
inevitable, we might be able to muddle through for a while longer,
though the climate crisis makes this dubious. [If]{.underline} total
hybrid [war between U.S.-NATO and Russia is]{.underline} not due to evil
Vladimir Putin or evil Joseph Biden, but [the result of capitalism and
the nation-state, then how much longer can capitalism last before
nuclear bombs go off?]{.underline}¶ The inevitably of war between
capitalist states¶ Long before Russia launched its special military
operation on February 24, there was talk about a New Cold War between
the United States and Russia. I have never liked the term "New Cold War"
to describe the crisis in relations between the two countries. First, we
can't be sure this new war will remain cold. But a more important
reason: The original Cold War between the United States and the Soviet
Union involved a struggle between two different classes presiding over
two different economic and social systems. The U.S. capitalist class vs.
the Soviet working class ruled over two different systems. The U.S.
capitalist system vs. the Soviet socialist system under construction.
(2) That Cold War was a global class war.¶ Today, [the United States and
Russia are both ruled by the capitalist class]{.underline}, [and the
capitalist economic and social system prevails.]{.underline} Even the
political systems are similar: Both have federated republics with
presidential systems. There are only some minor differences in
constitutional details.¶ But there are important differences between the
two, that if ignored, will cause grave political errors. Russia produces
raw materials and agricultural commodities it exchanges for consumer
commodities. It has a classical colonial or neocolonial relationship
within the global capitalist economy. Economically, if not
geographically, Russia belongs to the Global South. To paraphrase
Malcolm X, the Global South begins at the north pole. (3)¶ [One thing
the two countries have in common is that both underwent the process of
deindustrialization]{.underline}. The processes have different
characters and causes in each country. Large-scale deindustrialization
in the U.S. began with the 1979-1982 Volcker Shock. The U.S.
deindustrialization has not gone as far as Russia's. There are
similarities between the conditions found in many former Soviet
industrial production centers and the rust belt of the United States.
But U.S. deindustrialization is fundamentally the product of uneven
development, a consequence of capitalism.¶ Russian deindustrialization
began at the end of the 1980s as a consequence of the 1985-1991
political and social counterrevolution (4) restoring capitalist rule in
the former Soviet Union republics. This more radical deindustrialization
reflected a transition from a higher mode of production to a lower one.
This regressive transformation of production's social relations was
achieved with the destruction of the productive forces of former Soviet
republics.¶ Both countries produce raw materials, agricultural
commodities and gold bullion. But the United States is the center of
world finance capital. The U.S. dollar remains the world's chief reserve
currency. The international monetary system can be called the dollar
system. [The Russian ruble has never been used as a reserve
currency]{.underline}. As Lenin stressed in his book "Imperialism, the
Highest Stage of Capitalism" finance capital is dominant over industrial
capital. And [while both countries have huge arsenals of nuclear
weapons, the United States spends about 12 times more than Russia on
defense.]{.underline} (Source: Military Spending by Country 2022)¶ [The
United States only maintains a high level of military spending because
it leads the world in finance capital. The U.S. dollar as the global
currency plays a key role. This allows the huge military budget beyond
Russia's financial capacity]{.underline}.¶ [Russia engages only in
defensive wars near its borders. In contrast, the United States
maintains military bases and fights aggressive wars across the
globe]{.underline}. Russia became an oppressed nation in the world
capitalist economy due to the 1985-91 political and social
counterrevolution. The United States remains the leading oppressor
nation in the world, with Britain a distant second, and France and other
imperialist powers trailing behind. However, this doesn't change the
fact that both Russia and the U.S. are capitalist countries, politically
ruled by the capitalist class.¶ Since Russia has adopted the U.S.
social, economic, and even political system, there's no basis for a
global class war between them. Yet relations are now so bad that a
shooting war is at least as close as during the Cold War.¶ [How did we
arrive at this state of affairs]{.underline} and what is behind it?
During the counterrevolution in the Soviet Union dubbed "perestroika,"
its supporters justified their policy of surrender to U.S. imperialism
on the grounds it would end the danger of global nuclear war. Newspapers
of the time quoted Soviet political scientist Georgi Arbatov, a
perestroika supporter, as saying: "We are going to do a terrible thing
to you. We are going to deprive you of an enemy."¶ Now 30 years later it
is clear the claim that the Soviet surrender to global imperialism freed
the world from the threat of nuclear war was an illusion. A study of
20th-century history should have proved that Russia's embrace of
capitalism could only increase the threat of nuclear war. Let's look at
the 20th-century's world wars.¶ [During World War II, the United States
and Britain went to war against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Both
had capitalist economies]{.underline} much like the United States and
Britain. Japan had a parliamentary system. In the late 1930s and 1940s,
Japan was imperialist, militaristic and repressive, but it wasn't a
fascist dictatorship. This did not prevent Washington and London from
claiming World War II was to defeat global fascism represented by Nazi
Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan.¶ [Going back to World War I,
there were no fascist dictatorships]{.underline}. The chief powers
involved were Britain, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, Czarist Russia
and the United States. [These powers all had similar social, economic
and political systems]{.underline}. There were differences concerning
the degree of capitalist development and the extent of the lingering
elements of feudalism. Instead of feudal remnants, the United States had
the aftermath of modern slavery. (5) This existed in the form of the
Southern states' legal Jim Crow system and second-class citizenship for
the descendants of the African slaves in all the other states.¶ France
had the least feudalism thanks to the French Revolution of 1789-94,
while Japan and Russia had the most. The United States, under racist
President Woodrow Wilson, claimed to represent democracy as opposed to
autocratic Germany. Germany had an autocratic monarchy and the feudal
remnants of the militarist caste of Prussian Junkers. It also had a mass
workers party, the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Slavery had never
existed in Germany. The U.S. Socialist Party was weak. The working class
in the U.S. was less well-organized than in Germany. And we shouldn't
forget that none of them, the democratic-republican United States,
France, monarchical-autocratic Germany, or Czarist Russia, allowed women
to vote.¶ Differences in political systems did not line up with the
alliances of the contending powers. Czarist Russia was allied with
republican France!¶ Today, the Biden administration is embarrassed by
the similarities between U.S. and Russian social, political, and
economic systems. It is reduced to claiming the current war is about
democracy and autocracy, reminiscent of the claims made by World War I's
Wilson administration. In contrast, during the Cold War, there really
were differences between the social, political and economic systems of
the two countries.¶ [The current struggle is not over forms of
government]{.underline}, nor is it ideological. It is not a class war,
since the governments and states of both countries have the same class
character. **[This struggle is about the drive of U.S. imperialism to
bring Russia's and Ukraine's colossal wealth in natural resources under
its control.]{.underline}**¶ [Both countries are rich in farmlands as
well as mineral- and fossil-fuel-bearing lands but this isn't enough for
the economic needs of U.S. imperialism that have long outstripped the
resources available]{.underline} within its borders. [U.S. imperialism
wants the resources of Western Asia, Africa, Latin America, Ukraine, and
Russia under its control]{.underline}. [Russian capitalists are forced
to fight to maintain control of their own natural
resources]{.underline}. [Russia's capitalists are too weak to control
the resources of the rest of the world. This war now threatens to turn
into a global war and a nuclear holocaust]{.underline}.

#### Militarism makes conflict with Russia inevitable- it leads to expansion that heightens Russian nationalism and encourages aggression

**Smith 4/22** (James Smith, political and historical relations analyst;
4/22/22, "Obsession with NATO expansion: a deeply ideological move
inevitable in provoking conflicts", Global Times,
<https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202204/1257438.shtml> DOA 6/21/22)//nm

Although NATO was initially a defensive alliance against the Soviet
Union, [the ideological triumphalism]{.underline} which followed the
events of 1991 [saw it orient itself into an offensive proponent of
**consolidating the \"New World Order**]{.underline}\" and these
aforementioned regime changes. Thus, even though there was no major
state adversary, [the US subsequently **violated its promises** to
post-Cold War Russia that the alliance would not be
enlarged.]{.underline} In fact[, the West subsequently began to expand
NATO eastward]{.underline}, [citing]{.underline} the self-determination
of the countries involved **[as an ideologically irrefutable
choice]{.underline}**, a position that remains to this today. [The
post-Cold War Russia was not initially an enemy of the West, and sought
to integrate itself into it.]{.underline} However, [the country
found]{.underline} that having made peace and goodwill with the West in
the late days of the USSR, [ceding influence over Western
Europe]{.underline} and gutting its own economy in favor of Western
capitalist dominion would in fact be a mistake which [would leave Moscow
inherently worse off]{.underline}. The 1990s in Russia were
characterized by poor living standards for ordinary people, where new
mega wealthy \"oligarchs\" exploited the new environment and of course
for what? For the West not to see Russia as an equal partner in a new
consensus of peace, but to effect just continue in a bid to
strategically subjugate the country anyway. [The]{.underline} expansion
of NATO [combined with Western intervention in Yugoslavia were both
critical turning poi**nts which** **promulgated a new Russian distrust**
toward the intentions of the West]{.underline}. NATO and the [EU\'s
attempts to subsequently encroach Russia\'s own periphery would prove to
be the decisive straws which \"broke the camel\'s back\" and provoked
conflict]{.underline}. It is a logical feature of international
relations theory, as reiterated by leading scholar John Mearsheimer,
that **[attempting to ensnare and encircle one country with a hostile
military alliance is a straight route to conflict]{.underline}**. [The
West]{.underline} makes no apology for it, [believing that it is **their
ideological right** and destiny to do so]{.underline}, as the \"end of
history\" logic goes. Western expansion soon provoked in the Euromaidan
crisis of 2013 in Ukraine[, sparking a tidal wave of anti-Russian
nationalism]{.underline} which then opened up a geopolitical struggle
over the future of Ukraine. The West in turn failed to acknowledge how
the ultra-nationalist assault on Russian identity and language in the
country has also been humiliating to Moscow. The [US and its allies in
their hubris refused to compromise]{.underline}, setting off a chain
reaction of events leading to the present day[. Russia\'s reactions to
this context are branded as aggression and **zero-sum moral
evil**.]{.underline} However, they are in the strategic sense necessary
for Moscow to safeguard its own national security and offset military
and political domination by an adversarial military alliance. This whole
scenario was ultimately preventable. But [Western governments and media
continue to gravely mislead the public about its causes.]{.underline}
They\'re [pushing the never-ending ideological crusade that Western
liberal **democracy, must** without any questions and at all costs for
that matter, **dominate the entire earth**]{.underline}. It\'s an
attitude the Western world has held since 1991, [and it is on that note
ironically that such an attitude become a self-fulfilling prophecy in
instigating the largest conflict in Europe since the World War
II.]{.underline} [An opportunity to build a consolidated peace and
unity]{.underline} on the continent **[was jeopardized by ideological
and strategic puritanism.]{.underline}** This is, as what Mearsheimer
titled in his signature book, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics.

### K Turns Cyber

#### K turns the aff- expanded cybersecurity industry results in technology being sold to adversaries- it undermines US national security objectives

Tech Writer at Cybernews, and has published over 6,000 articles on
technology and the workplace. His focus is the industrial and policy
aspects of cybersecurity. Adi has a masters degree in IT, specialising
in artificial intelligence. Adi currently advises the European Institute
of Innovation & Technology; Report highlights the growth in the cyber
military-industrial complex; CyberNews;
https://cybernews.com/security/report-highlights-the-growth-in-the-cyber-military-industrial-complex/

Kaspersky\'s recent advanced persistent threat report highlighted [the
growth in state-sponsored hacking groups]{.underline}, with the likes of
the Kremlin-backed APT29 and Nobelium prime examples of the willingness
of nation-states to deploy private-sector hackers for geopolitical
ends.¶ It['s]{.underline} **[part of a growing cyber military-industrial
complex]{.underline}** that is emphasized in a recent report from the
Atlantic Council, which attempts to shed some light on what has often
been a murky and secretive industry.¶ \"[State cyber capabilities are
increasingly abiding by the "pay-to-play" model]{.underline}---**[both
US/NATO allies and adversaries can purchase interception and intrusion
technologies from private firms]{.underline}** for intelligence and
surveillance purposes,\" the report says.¶ Into the shadows¶ [The murky
nature of this industry is largely something that suits both
sides]{.underline}, but it has made a detailed analysis of it hard. The
paper attempts to correct that and shed some light on both the active
players in the market and their capabilities.¶ [The researchers were
able to identify a wide range of actors offering a panoply of
interception and intrusion technologies]{.underline} before exploring
how these entities accessed the market and who they are selling to.¶ The
authors believe that [they have been able to identify a number of firms
headquartered in both the Middle East and Europe that are actively
selling their wares to adversaries of NATO and the United
States]{.underline}. What\'s more, [many of these firms are not shy in
promoting their wares,]{.underline} with an active presence at major
international trade shows, such as Security & Policing UK and Milipol
France.¶ A booming industry¶ The scale of the industry was reflected in
the finding that [75% of companies selling these technologies have done
so outside of their home continent]{.underline}. [The
companies]{.underline}, which the authors brand as \"irresponsible
proliferators\", **[have found especially willing buyers outside of NATO
and the United States.]{.underline}**¶ \"[By marketing to these parties,
these firms signal that they are willing to accept or ignore the risk
that their products will bolster the capabilities of client governments
that might wish to threaten US/NATO national security]{.underline} or
harm marginalized populations,\" the authors warn. \"This is especially
the case when the client government is a direct US or NATO adversary.\"¶
[The global nature of the industry illustrates the growing proliferation
of advanced cyber capabilities]{.underline} around the world, [with
these companies increasingly willing to use their nation-state clients
to provide them with an air of respectability and
legitimacy]{.underline}. It\'s an argument that rests on flimsy ground,
however, not least due to the fact that nation-states are willing and
able to shift the focus of attacks into other intelligence areas once
capabilities have been established.¶ In total, the researchers analyzed
over 200 firms operating in the surveillance space, including Israeli
firm Cellebrite, which develops a range of forensics and phone hacking
tools that are commonly deployed in countries such as China and Russia.
Indeed, the company's technology was used during the Chinese crackdown
of anti-government forces in Hong Kong.¶ National security concerns¶ The
authors argue that [both the nature of the technology and its customers
should trigger significant national security concerns, with the breadth
of sales signifying considerable problems with oversight,]{.underline}
especially as the firms appear to show no real willingness to
self-regulate who they sell to or for what purpose.¶ The phrase
"irresponsible proliferators" is deliberately provocative, with the
authors hoping that it will encourage lawmakers to do more to regulate
the sector and help protect what are often extremely vulnerable groups.¶
Various governments have made moves in this direction in recent years,
with the European Union adopting more stringent rules on surveillance
technology in a bid to make the industry more transparent than it
currently is. Meanwhile, the US has also introduced new licensing rules
to help regulate the sale of intrusion tools, with the likes of Israeli
spyware firm NSO Group among those who have been blacklisted.¶ "[While
some argue for an arms-control treaty for cyberspace, regulating cyber
capabilities themselves is largely ineffective]{.underline}," the
authors say. "Instead, shaping the behaviors of companies proliferating
cyber capabilities, and limiting their activities where they conflict
with national security priorities, should be the top priority."¶
Tackling the industry¶ To do this, [you first have to be aware of the
true extent of the industry]{.underline} and the behavior of those
operating in it. The authors hope that their report will be a useful
first step towards achieving this. With the UN recently warning against
the use of cyber-mercenaries, it is clear that there is growing concern
about the use of cyber-criminals to cause real damage in the real
world.¶ ["It is undeniable that cyber-activities have the ability to
cause violations both in armed conflicts and in peacetime, and thus that
a whole variety of rights are engaged]{.underline}," Jelena Aparac,
Chair Rapporteur of the Working Group on the use of mercenaries, said.
"This includes the right to life, economic social rights, freedom of
expression, privacy, and the right to self-determination."¶
[Successfully controlling the industry is made that much harder by the
obfuscation that surrounds it,]{.underline} [with various shell
companies and resellers making it hard to truly identify either the
buyers or the sellers]{.underline}. Nonetheless, **[there is a growing
appreciation that even tools developed for "friendly" regimes often end
up in unsavory hands]{.underline}**, and therefore there is a strong
need to better govern tools that can do so much harm, not least by
limiting the access to the kind of cyber-surveillance events that
allowed the researchers to examine the industry in the first place.

### War/Structural Violence

#### Militarism is the root cause of mass war and structural violence by fostering the buildup of military power in the name of securing a capitalist economic order- policy makers must prioritize structural violence over the inflated threat scenarios of the 1AC

**Acheson in 2022**

Ray Acheson is the Director of WILPF's Disarmament Programme, which
provides analysis, research, and advocacy across a range of disarmament
issues from an antimilitarist feminist perspective; Militarism Cannot
Prevent War: An urgent call for de-escalation, demilitarisation, and
disarmament in relation to Ukraine and beyond; NATO Watch;
https://natowatch.org/default/2022/militarism-cannot-prevent-war-urgent-call-de-escalation-demilitarisation-and

[Behind this current crisis lies a history of militarised]{.underline}
and economic [violence]{.underline}. [Both Russia and the United States
are settler colonial states]{.underline}, forging their countries by
expanding their "frontiers" and killing and repressing Indigenous
populations. [Both engage in imperialist actions]{.underline} outside of
their now-established borders, interfering, through military and
economic action, in countries they deem to be within their "spheres of
influence". [Both use militarism]{.underline}, aggression, and forced
economic ties [to guide their conduct in international
relations,]{.underline} and both deal with domestic inequality, poverty,
and resistance through policing and punishment.¶ The governments of both
countries critique each other for the same type of behaviour. Russia
criticises US imperialism, yet invades and occupies its neighbours,
bombs civilians, and engages in cyber-attacks against critical
infrastructure that harm ordinary people. The United States criticises
Russia as an autocracy yet overthrows democratically elected governments
if they threaten US interests, builds military bases and engages in wars
and military operations in hundreds of countries around the world, and
spends billions of dollars a year on militarism while so many of its
citizens live without health care, housing, or food security.¶ Both
countries have built up their militaries, military alliances, and
nuclear arsenals to challenge the other. The North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation ([NATO)'s expansion eastward is about constraining
Russia,]{.underline} just like Russia's invasion of countries to the
west are about constraining NATO. Ukraine, in this context, is a pawn
being used by both "sides".¶ **[This gamesmanship runs the serious risk
of mass destruction.]{.underline}** [Between them, Russia and the United
States possess more than 11,850 nuclear weapons]{.underline}. NATO
members France and the United Kingdom have a few hundred each. The US
also stations about 100 nuclear weapons in NATO members Belgium,
Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Turkey. These weapons are not remnants
of a past Cold War --- they are actively deployed right now, ready to be
used. The stockpile numbers, alarming as they are, don't convey the
sheer horror each weapon packs within it. Every single bomb is designed
to melt flesh, burn cities, decimate plants and animals, and unleash
radioactive poison that lasts for generations. Even the use of one of
these weapons would be disastrous. A nuclear exchange would be
catastrophic.¶ Russia and the United States, along with France, United
Kingdom, and China, together recently agreed that a nuclear war cannot
be won and must never be fought, echoing a statement from Gorbachev and
Reagan in 1985. Yet each of these countries has been investing billions
in the "modernisation" and expansion of their nuclear arsenals,
preparing not for nuclear disarmament but for nuclear Armageddon. Each
maintains doctrines and policies for the use of nuclear weapons. And
some within the US nuclear complex, at least, apparently believe that
nuclear war can be fought --- and won. This is an incredibly dangerous
message to be sending to those responsible for the potential destruction
of the world, but one that benefits the military-industrial complex.¶
[There are other corporate interests behind the festering conflict**,
including in relation to weapons production and sale,**]{.underline}
pipelines and "energy security," **[and access to "natural
resources]{.underline}**," **[with profits to be made at the expense of
human lives as well as the protection of the planet]{.underline}**. [In
the midst of a climate emergency, in which capitalist
extraction]{.underline} and exploitation [has decimated
biodiversity]{.underline}, ecosystems, and land, water, and air, [the
governments of NATO members and Russia continue to use fossil fuels and
refuse to embrace a degrowth economy]{.underline} that would drawdown
the use of energy, especially in the global north, and prioritise the
creation of systems of care and equality for people and planet.¶
Militarised world order and the abstraction of harm¶ There is plenty of
blame to go around when it comes to the current crisis and the
historical moments that have led us here. All parties involved have
contributed actively to this situation; [arguing that one side or the
other has been "provoked" only serves **to obscure the reality that each
of the countries involved have together**,]{.underline} deliberately,
**[built a militarised, capitalist world order that exclusively serves
the interests of the war profiteers and the political and economic
elite]{.underline}**.¶ What is happening right now over Ukraine is
bigger than Ukraine. [Tectonic shifts in global geopolitics are taking
place and Ukraine is but one field of "play" for the heavily militarised
states]{.underline}. [Gamesmanship between the United States and China
is on the rise;]{.underline} proxy wars, occupations and aggression, and
military and economic pressure is occurring throughout the world;
extraction primarily by the global north and exploitation of the
so-called global south is rampant, exacerbating and accelerating poverty
and inequalities and environmental devastation; [militarism and military
spending is on the rise globally. **Approaching the situation in Ukraine
without recognising this larger context is like applying a band aid to a
global haemorrhage.**]{.underline} **[It is a piece of a much bigger
puzzle: of a world order dictated and dominated by the militarised
elite]{.underline}**.¶ [This is a world order that sees war as a
legitimate means to an end. It celebrates]{.underline} militarised
masculinities, empowering [the culture of militarism and violence as
brave and noble pursuits]{.underline}, **[while rendering invisible the
gendered and racialised harms of militarism]{.underline}**. [It is a
world order that uses a technostrategic language to sanitise the image
of war. Think tanks and politicians]{.underline}, media, and war gamers
[act as if countries are chess pieces and people are numbers on a
page]{.underline}. US government officials, for example, have estimated
that a war in Ukraine could kill 25,000 to 50,000 civilians, 5,000 to
25,000 Ukrainian military personnel, and 3,000 to 10,000 Russian
soldiers. The fighting since 2014, in eastern Ukraine it should be
noted, has already killed more than 14,000 people and displaced
millions.¶ [Instead of seeing these people as individuals, whose lives
have value]{.underline} and meaning, who are part of families and
communities, [the number crunchers calculate "acceptable loss" and risks
of "collateral damage,"]{.underline} and look the other way as the
bodies pile up. Also accounted for is the disruption to daily life ---
the interruption of education, of food production, of supply chains; the
destruction of hospitals, homes, markets, water and sanitation
facilitations, and all of the other critical infrastructure that people
rely on to survive. [These numbers don't take into account the
psychological terror of living in conflict,]{.underline} of hearing
bombs dropped or drones hovering overhead, of being afraid to leave your
house, of watching loved ones die. [These figures also don't take into
account the environmental impacts of war]{.underline}, the toxic or
explosive remnants of weapons, the damage to land and water and
animals.¶ **[These humanitarian and environmental impacts should be at
the forefront of all policy making decisions]{.underline}**. **[Yet they
are completely ignored by those talking in board rooms in capital cities
far from where the harm will be felt, deciding what choices to make for
the sake of "geopolitical strategy" or "balance of
power".]{.underline}**

### Racialized Violence

#### Militarism results in racialized violence around the globe as the US secures its interests through the exploitation and control of other populations

To many living between its shores, the United States is a land of
freedom and¶ promise, a haven for unfettered practice of religion, a
place where the son of a¶ black man from Kenya and a white woman from
Kansas can not only dream¶ of a better future but rise to become
president. To many outside U.S. borders,¶ the torch of liberty offers a
beacon of hope for equality and opportunity.¶ But to
others---particularly people of color at home and abroad---the reality¶
is very different. [The United States]{.underline} is a country that
[has failed to]{.underline} publicly¶ acknowledge, apologize for, or
[make amends for its long history of genocide]{.underline}¶ [and
slavery]{.underline}---despite loudly proclaiming itself as a leader in
combating these¶ very evils in other countries.¶ **[It is a nation that
explicitly seeks global military primacy and conducts]{.underline}**¶
**[aggressive military operations]{.underline}** on multiple continents
with seeming disregard¶ for their impact on innocent civilians. [It is a
country whose political leaders]{.underline}¶ [are willing to spend
trillions on]{.underline} senseless foreign wars and [weapon
systems]{.underline}¶ [but not on]{.underline} building racial,
economic, and environmental [justice]{.underline}.¶ American political
culture celebrates the nation's virtues while demonstrating¶ collective
amnesia about its sins. Particularly, but certainly not exclusively,¶ in
the foreign policy and national security sphere, [elites
ignore]{.underline}, reject, [and]{.underline}¶ [rationalize the
enormous harms that the United States has caused through]{.underline}¶
[its long history of imperial expansion, structural racism,
and]{.underline} economic and¶ [military domination]{.underline}.
**[This is not accidental: it is a result of belief
systems]{.underline}**---¶ **[manifested in policies and
institutions]{.underline}**---that we refer to collectively as the¶
Racism-Militarism Paradigm.¶ [The Racism-Militarism Paradigm is a way of
looking at the world, widely]{.underline}¶ [shared among the U.S.
policymaking community]{.underline} and much of the public,¶ [that
arises from a]{.underline} largely unacknowledged **[doctrine of white
supremacy]{.underline}**¶ **[and the necessity of using violence to
uphold it]{.underline}**. [This paradigm establishes]{.underline}¶ [a
rigid hierarchy]{.underline}, based on race, [that values white lives
above all others]{.underline}---at¶ home and abroad. [It embraces
militarism as the most effective mechanism to]{.underline}¶ [guarantee
this ordering of society]{.underline} and the world.¶ The
Racism-Militarism Paradigm has a number of core theories/myths and is¶
manifested in a myriad of concrete and abstract ways. The principal
belief is¶ in [the racial superiority of whites]{.underline} and their
entitlement, exceptionalism, and¶ indispensability. This
[is]{.underline} then **[used to justify global military
domination]{.underline}** and¶ economic exploitation by the United
States. [The paradigm assumes that we]{.underline}¶ [live in a zero-sum
world defined by]{.underline} scarcity and [competition]{.underline}
over resources¶ and that humans are by nature selfish and greedy. In
such a world, each man is therefore "out for himself"---but the needs
and desires of white men are¶ viewed as synonymous with those of the
United States as a nation and are¶ thus considered more important and
more valuable than those of all others.¶ [A key component of this
paradigm is the belief that violence is effective.]{.underline}¶
[Domination through the use of military force is considered a necessity
that]{.underline}¶ [offers the ultimate guarantee of]{.underline}
protection of rights and physical [safety]{.underline} to¶ those who
wield it. For example, since 2018 the United States has engaged¶ in
combat in eight countries and conducted military counterterrorism¶
operations in 85 countries. The Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria,
Yemen,¶ and other wars have cost U.S. taxpayers at least \$6.4 trillion
and resulted in¶ the deaths of at least 800,000 mostly brown and Black
people.¶ [The Pentagon budget, nearing \$750 billion, is higher now than
at the peak of]{.underline}¶ [the Vietnam War]{.underline} or the Cold
War and is larger than the defense budgets of¶ the next ten
highest-spending countries combined. It also constitutes more¶ than half
of the discretionary funding requested by U.S. presidents and¶ approved
by Congress---for decades.¶ [A corollary to this paradigm is the old
European justification for]{.underline} colonialism¶ and [imperialism
known as the white man's burden]{.underline}, [which holds
that]{.underline} African¶ and Asian nations and [peoples
need]{.underline} European and white **[American
tutelage]{.underline}**¶ **[and discipline]{.underline}** and that the
white race has a moral obligation to civilize such¶ people. These racist
and paternalistic attitudes permeate not only official¶ U.S. diplomacy
and development efforts, but also the civilizing mission of¶ many
churches and private voluntary aid organizations.¶ The evolution of this
paradigm is not surprising, given that America's¶ economic and military
might were built on land stolen from the Indigenous¶ people of North
America and the labor of enslaved Africans. From genocide¶ and
enslavement to westward expansionism, hemispheric domination, and¶
global imperialism, [the United States has consistently relied
upon]{.underline} coercion,¶ intimidation, and [violence to enforce
white supremacy while describing it]{.underline}¶ [throughout history as
a mission of enlightenment.]{.underline}¶ With the conscious and
unconscious establishment of the Racism-Militarism¶ Paradigm in the
minds of most Americans, those who are defined as¶ others, both
domestically and internationally, are routinely marginalized,¶
dehumanized, and exploited. **[The narrow interests of wealthy and
powerful]{.underline}**¶ **[white men are mythologized and legitimized
as the national security interests]{.underline}**¶ **[of the United
States]{.underline}**. ¶ In parallel, the national faith in violence is
romanticized as patriotism, and¶ as a result, Americans treat the U.S.
armed forces and law enforcement¶ personnel with cultish devotion,
affording them unparalleled resources,¶ trust, and respect.¶ [This
addiction to militaristic solutions]{.underline} heightens the fear of
chaos, [propels]{.underline}¶ [a lust for strength in all its
forms,]{.underline} and engenders a culture of military¶ reverence. [The
military capabilities of rival countries are interpreted
as]{.underline}¶ [threats, and U.S. credibility is defined by the
ability]{.underline} and willingness [to carry]{.underline}¶ [out
violence]{.underline} to destroy others. Superior capacity for violence
is purported¶ to keep Americans safe.¶ [War crimes, police brutality,
mass incarceration, border militarization, and]{.underline}¶ [capital
punishment are excused as unfortunate but unavoidable means
of]{.underline}¶ [deterring crime and aggression]{.underline}. Other
types of coercion and intimidation---¶ often economic, but with harmful
physical impacts---are also used routinely¶ and without question.¶ It is
essential to note that [acceptance of the Racism-Militarism
Paradigm]{.underline},¶ while widespread, [is largely
unconscious]{.underline}. Few of those who have¶ internalized its
precepts recognize it as a mechanism for enforcing systemic¶ white
supremacy. Importantly, individuals need not be white, Christian,¶ male,
or avowed racists to believe that the United States has the right, the¶
responsibility, and the power to control what other nations do.¶ [The
paradigm is so pervasive throughout U.S. society that it
masquerades]{.underline}¶ [as objective truth]{.underline}, blinding
most Americans and their leaders to its origins¶ and purpose. [Because
it draws on a number of deeply held and/or widely]{.underline}¶
[promoted values]{.underline}---honor, discipline, order, loyalty,
authority---[it can seem]{.underline}¶ [like common sense rather than
the ideological construct that it is.]{.underline}

### Ukraine/US-Russia

#### The crisis in Ukraine is a symptom of the broader decay of neoliberal capitalism- underlying economic and social crises make collapse inevitable- calls to "solve Russia" are a facile attempt to paper over these structural contradictions

Alastair **Crooke**, New Cold War, **2022**

THE WORLD DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY ANYMORE; Popular Resistance;
https://popularresistance.org/the-world-doesnt-work-that-way-anymore/

[The Fixation With Ukraine]{.underline} Essentially [Is]{.underline} But
[A Gloss Pasted Over The Realities Of A Global Order In
Decomposition]{.underline}.¶ [The First World War signaled the end to a
mercantilist order]{.underline} that had evolved under the aegis of
European powers. [One hundred years later, a very different economic
order was in place]{.underline} (neoliberal cosmopolitanism). [Believed
by its architects to be universal]{.underline} and everlasting,
[globalization transfixed the world for an extended moment]{.underline},
[but then started the subsidence from its zenith]{.underline} --
precisely at the moment the West was giving vent to its triumphalism at
the fall of the Berlin Wall. [NATO]{.underline} -- as the order's
regulatory system -- [addressed its attendant 'identity crisis' by
pushing for eastward expansion toward Russia's western borders,
disregarding the guarantees it had given]{.underline}, and Moscow's
virulent objections.¶ [This radical alienation of Russia triggered its
pivot to China.]{.underline} [Europe and the U.S. however, declined to
consider issues of due 'balance' within global structures]{.underline},
and simply glossed over the realities of a world order in momentous
metamorphosis: [with the steady decline of the U.S. already
apparent]{.underline}; with a European faux 'unity' that masked its own
inherent imbalances; [and in the context of a hyper-financialized
economic structure which lethally sucked out the juice from the real
economy]{.underline}.¶ [The present war in Ukraine therefore simply is
an adjunct]{.underline} -- the accelerant [to this existing process of
'liberal order' decomposition. It is not its center]{.underline}.
Fundamentally geo-strategic in their origin, [the explosive dynamics to
today's disintegration can be seen as blowback from the mismatch from
diverse peoples' looking now to solutions tailored to suit their
non-western civilizations, and from the western insistence on its 'one
size fits all' Order]{.underline}. **[Ukraine thus is a symptom, but is
not per se, the deeper disorder itself.]{.underline}**¶ Tom Luongo has
remarked -- in connection with the 'messy', confusing events of today --
that that which he fears most, is so many people analyzing the
intersection of geopolitics, markets and ideology, and doing so with
such striking complacency. "[There is a stunning amount of normalcy bias
in the punditocracy]{.underline}, too much 'cooler heads will prevail'
and not enough 'everyone's got a plan until they're punched in the
mouth'".¶ What Luongo's retort doesn't fully explain is the shrillness,
the outrage, with which any doubting of the accredited 'punditocracy' of
the moment is met. Plainly, [there is a deeper fear stalking the lower
depths of western psyche that is not being made fully
explicit.]{.underline}¶ Wolfgang Münchau, formerly at the Financial
Times, now authoring EuroIntelligence, describes how [such a canonized
Zeitgeist implicitly has imprisoned Europe in a cage of adverse dynamics
which threaten its economy,]{.underline} its autonomy, its globalism and
its being.¶ Münchau relates how both the pandemic and Ukraine had taught
him that it was one thing to proclaim an interconnected globalism 'as
cliché', but¶ "[It is quite another to observe what actually happens on
the ground when those connections get torn apart]{.underline} ...
[Western sanctions were based on a]{.underline} formally correct, but
[misleading premise]{.underline} -- one that I believed myself -- at
least up to a point: [That Russia is more dependent on us than we are on
Russia]{.underline} ... Russia however is a provider of primary and
secondary commodities, on which the world has become dependent. But when
the largest exporter of those commodities disappears, the rest of the
world experiences physical shortages and rising prices".¶ He continues:¶
["Did we think this through? Did the foreign ministries that drew up the
sanctions discuss at any point what we would do if Russia were to
blockade the Black Sea and not allow Ukrainian wheat to leave the
ports?...]{.underline} Or, did we think we can adequately address a
global starvation crisis by pointing the finger at Putin?"¶ "The
lockdown taught us a lot about our vulnerability to supply chain shocks.
It has reminded Europeans that there have only two routes to ship goods
en masse to Asia and back: either by container, or by rail through
Russia. [We had no plan for a pandemic, no plan for a war, and no plan
for when both are happening at the same time.]{.underline} The
containers are stuck in Shanghai. The railways closed because of the war
...¶ ["I am not sure the west is ready to confront the consequences of
its actions]{.underline}: persistent inflation, reduced industrial
output, lower growth, and higher unemployment. To me, economic sanctions
look like the last hurrah of a dysfunctional concept known as The West.
The Ukraine war is a catalyst of massive de-globalization."¶ [Münchau's
response is that unless we cut a deal with Putin, with the removal of
sanctions as a component, he sees "a danger of the world becoming
subject to two trading blocs]{.underline}: the west and the rest. Supply
chains will be reorganized to stay within them. Russia's energy, wheat,
metals, and rare earths will still be consumed, but not here -- We
\[just\] keep with the Big Macs".¶ So again, 'one' searches for an
answer: Why are the Euro-élites so shrill, so passionate in their
support for Ukraine? And risk heart-attack from the sheer vehemence of
their hatred for Putin? After all, most Europeans and Americans until
this year knew next-to-naught about Ukraine.¶ We know the answer**[: the
deeper fear is that all the landmarks to liberal life]{.underline}** --
for reasons they do not understand -- **[are about to be forever swept
away]{.underline}**. And that Putin is doing it. How will 'we' navigate
life, bereft of landmarks? What will become of us? [We thought the
liberal way-of-being was ineluctable. Another value-system?
Impossible!]{.underline}¶ So, for Europeans, [the endgame in Ukraine
crucially must reaffirm European self-identity]{.underline} (even at the
cost of its citizens' economic well-being). Such wars historically,
mostly have ended with a dirty diplomatic settlement. That 'end'
probably would be enough for the EU leadership to spin a 'win'.¶ And
there was a big EU diplomatic drive to persuade Putin to do a deal, only
last week.¶ But (paraphrasing and elaborating Münchau), it is one thing
to proclaim the desirability of a negotiated ceasefire 'as cliché'. "It
is quite another to observe what actually happens on the ground when
blood is being spilled to put facts on the ground ...".¶ Western
diplomatic initiatives are premised on Russia needing a 'way out', more
than does Europe need one. But is that true?¶ Paraphrasing Münchau
again:¶ "Did we think this through? Did the foreign ministries that drew
up the plans to train and arm a Ukrainian insurgency in Donbas in the
hope of weakening Russia -- discuss at any point what effect their war
and their expressed contempt for Russia might have on Russian public
opinion? Or what 'we' would do if Russia simply opted instead to put
facts on the ground until it finished its project ... Or did we even
address the possibility of Kiev losing, and what that would mean for a
Europe loaded to the gills with sanctions that then would never end?".¶
[The hope for a negotiated settlement has given way to a more somber
mood in Europe. Putin was uncompromising]{.underline} in the talks with
European leaders. The realization is dawning in Paris and Berlin that a
fudged settlement is not something that benefits Putin, nor is one that
he can afford. The Russian public mood will not easily accept that its
soldiers' blood was spent in some vain exercise, ending in a 'dirty'
compromise -- only to have the West resuscitate a new Ukraine insurgency
against the Donbas again, in a year or two.¶ [The EU leaders must be
sensing their predicament: They may have 'missed the boat' for getting a
political 'fix'. But they have not 'missed the boat' in respect
to]{.underline} inflation, economic contraction, and of [social crisis
at home. These ships are heading in their direction, at full
steam]{.underline}. Did the EU foreign ministries reflect on this
eventuality, or were they carried along by euphoria and the credentialed
narrative issuing out from the Baltics and Poland of 'Bad Man Putin'?¶
Here is the point: [The fixation with Ukraine essentially is but a gloss
pasted over the realities of a global order in decomposition. The latter
is the source of the wider disorder]{.underline}. **[Ukraine is but one
small piece on the chess board, and its outcome will not fundamentally
change that 'reality'. Even a 'win' in Ukraine would not grant
'immortality' to the neoliberal rules-based order.]{.underline}**¶ [The
noxious fumes emanating from the global financial system]{.underline}
are wholly unconnected to Ukraine -- but are that much more significant
for they [go to the heart of the 'disorder' within the western 'liberal
order']{.underline}. [Perhaps it is this primordial unspoken fear that
accounts for the shrillness and rancor directed at any deviation from
sanctioned Ukraine messaging?]{.underline}¶ And Luongo's normalcy bias
in discourse is never more in evidence (Ukraine aside), than when
addressing the strange self-selectivity of Anglo-American thinking about
their neoliberal economic order.¶ [The Anglo-American system of politics
and economics]{.underline}, James Fallows a former White House
speechwriter has noted, like any system, [rests on certain principles
and beliefs]{.underline}. "[But rather than acting as if these are the
best principles,]{.underline} or the ones their societies prefer,
[Britons and Americans often act as if these were the only possible
principles]{.underline}: [And that no one, except in error, could choose
any others. Political economics becomes an essentially religious
question, subject to the standard drawback of any religion---the failure
to understand why people outside the faith might act as they
do".]{.underline}

#### **US militarism is not the solution to the war in Ukraine, it's the root cause**

**Petersen-Smith, '22** (Khury Petersen-Smiths, the Michael Ratner
Middle East Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies. 02-09-2022, \"
US-NATO Militarism Is the Cause, Not the Solution,\"
<https://www.commondreams.org/views/2022/02/09/us-nato-militarism-cause-not-solution)-Cayden>
Mayer

The rising tensions between Ukraine, Russia, the United States and other
NATO countries---and the resulting discourse in U.S. media---show that
American leaders love an international crisis. [In a crisis, the
American public is often discouraged from asking questions---and when
they do, militarism is usually the answer]{.underline}. Even as
Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky discourages panic and downplays
the idea that a Russian invasion is imminent, American officials are
portraying armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine as inevitable---and
U.S. military support of Ukraine as necessary. \"What\'s the
alternative?\" asked retired Brigadier General and former Defense
Attaché to Moscow Peter Zwack in an interview on NPR. ​\"Do we just let
them get invaded, or do we make the cost so high on the ground-level
military---but also the diplomatic and the economic?\" [The choice being
put forward is between military action or inaction; to opt for
​\"inaction\" is presented as an abandonment of Ukraine]{.underline}.
Zwack\'s prescription is ​\"lethal weapons\"---specifically Javelin
anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. And the U.S. is
delivering. In just over a week, [the U.S. made four shipments of
weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}---a move that has U.S. arms
manufacturers anticipating soaring profits for their shareholders. The
particular kind of crisis story that American officials are deploying in
the situation with Ukraine is a familiar one: An underdog faces a threat
from an authoritarian regime, so the United States must come to the
rescue with a military response. In an interview on NPR, [Republican
Representativ]{.underline}e and Chair of Congress\'s Ukraine Caucus
[Brian Fitzpatrick]{.underline} of Pennsylvania [offered a historical
analogy]{.underline} often invoked by American officials to justify
military action. \"[When we defended Kuwait in Operation Desert
Shield]{.underline},\" Fitzpatrick said, ​\"[we sent a
message]{.underline} to the world that you cannot violate the
territorial integrity of an independent nation. And Ukraine should be no
different. We have to send a very strong and unequivocal message to
Vladimir Putin, which would also be a message to Xi Jinping, to Kim Jong
Un and other bad actors around the world that this is not OK to do.\"
Fitzpatrick\'s interviewer didn\'t question his response. But [his
example]{.underline} of U.S. military action in Iraq in 1991 [shows
exactly why it\'s critical to question the narrative being pushed by
U.S. media, especially during times of cris]{.underline}is. In
Fitzpatrick\'s account of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the U.S. appears
to be a bystander responding to Iraqi actions. But [his story
conveniently omits the fact that just prior to its invasion of Kuwait,
Iraq counted the U.S. as an ally---one that supplied it with weapons
during the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. It also ignores that the story
did not end with Desert Shield. The U.S. quickly shifted its supposed
defense of Kuwait into its own invasion---Operation Desert Storm---of
Iraq. In that assault, the U.S. killed some 100,000 Iraqis and shattered
the countr]{.underline}y. It then imposed catastrophic economic
sanctions on Iraq, which were responsible for the deaths of another
million Iraqis. It accompanied this policy with air patrols of Iraq, and
bombed the country intermittently over the next decade. And finally, the
U.S. invaded once again in 2003, occupied Iraq after and maintains about
2,500 troops there to this day. Cherry-picking past examples of U.S.
intervention excludes vital context and falls short of telling the whole
story. Narratives like these obscure ongoing, longstanding military
operations and other policies that make the world more dangerous and
which have no end in sight. Still, there are moments when officials
share details that unintentionally reveal that U.S. involvement in the
crisis on the Ukrainian border is far more complicated than they have
been acknowledging. With 8,500 U.S. troops readied for deployment, a
journalist asked during a White House press conference if sending forces
to the countries that NATO counts as its ​\"Eastern Flank\" might
escalate the situation rather than calm it. ​\"We\'ve had troops in the
Eastern Flank countries for decades,\" Press Secretary Jen Psaki
replied. Indeed, the U.S. maintains an enormous, nuclear armed military
presence in Europe---and in the years leading up to the current crisis,
it has spent millions of dollars arming Ukraine in particular. [Since
the 2014 conflict in Ukraine, in which Russia annexed the Crimean
Peninsula, the U.S. has sent hundreds of millions of dollars\' worth of
weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}---in 2015, 2018, 2019 and
2020---including its celebrated Javelin missiles. Psaki\'s admission
begs some follow-up questions: If U.S. troops and weapons have already
been in Ukraine for years---and in Europe for decades---but their
presence has not deterred Russia from mobilizing troops to the Ukrainian
border, why does the Pentagon think that more weapons and troops will do
so now? And could it be, perhaps, that this same U.S. militarism is a
cause of rising tension in Eastern Europe, rather than its solution? It
would be wrong to minimize the potential devastation of a Russian
invasion of Ukraine should one occur. But [U.S. actions are raising
tensions rather than resolving them.]{.underline} While they speak of
Ukrainian sovereignty, it is clear that U.S. officials are primarily
preoccupied with Russian military aggression that they see as
threatening a world order that the U.S. presides over. And as
Representative Fitzpatrick makes clear, they also want to send a message
to China and other states that they consider hostile. [Ultimately,
increased U.S. militarism in Eastern Europe---as history has repeatedly
made clear---will only make the situation worse.]{.underline}

### FW- Epistemology/Research First

#### Research practices should frame your ballot---the 1AC's militarist assumptions trade off with the educational value of critical reflection in security politics

**Bellanova '20** (Rocco Bellanova, Assistant Professor Critical Data

The riches of STS We propose that one way to take the trouble is
focusing on the [devices, technologies, objects, knowledge and
materialities that shape security]{.underline}. Notably, we want to
highlight that understanding ever-evolving technologies and their
applications requires security scholars to go beyond disciplinary
boundaries. [History, ethics, law, computer sciences and media studies
all bring valuable perspectives to the study of security
politics.]{.underline} [Deploying resources from other disciplines
pushes]{.underline} the researcher away from that which feels
comfortable and [towards new modes of thinking, new analytical
distinctions and new conceptual apparatuses]{.underline}. Illustrative
of this is the rich literature from various security scholars who have
already looked to STS when developing new analytical approaches [to
issues ranging from drones]{.underline} (Leander 2013) to stoves
(Abdelnour and Saeed 2014). Our invitation, of course, does not mean
abandoning CSS, but provokes [an ongoing questioning of its dynamics and
**ontological and philosophical underpinnings**]{.underline}. Therefore,
it does imply a commitment to being curious about [the value of
approaching the study of security through a new lens]{.underline}, as a
way to gain appreciation of additional dimensions. Ultimately, this
brings the risk of becoming even further detached from more orthodox
understandings of what IR and security studies are expected to be, what
they should be concerned with, and which conceptual terms are useful.
Yet, such an apprehension would be not dissimilar to the suspicions
advanced by scholars like Stephen Walt (1991, 213) with respect to the
programme of 'broadening the notion of "security" to include topics such
as poverty, AIDS, environmental hazards, drug abuse, and the like.'
Moreover, a object-driven transdisciplinary journey may trigger worries
about CSS consistency. We believe the contributions to this Special
Issue demonstrate how these conceptual, empirical and methodological
troubles are troubles worth taking Acknowledging that science and
technology are core aspects of security studies shows great promise.
This is different from claiming that science and technology are de facto
more important today than a few decades ago. Rather it means that
[recent technological developments like the internet]{.underline} (Carr
2015; Herrera 2002), [cybersecurity]{.underline} (Dunn Cavelty 2013;
Fichtner 2018) [and new weapons (Boyle 2013; Huelss 2019) require that
we **pay attention to their (in)security politics**.]{.underline}
However, not all technology-focused research in security studies takes
its inspiration from STS, and nor do all studies of security
technologies and the intersection of science and (in)security take place
within the field of security studies. In fact, [STS scholars have had a
long-standing concern with providing analyses of security practices and
objects]{.underline}. For instance, in her contribution Lucy Suchman
(2020) engages with Donald MacKenzie's (1990, 4) work [on the 'invention
of accuracy' of ballistic nuclear missiles, to unpack the discursive and
practical effects of the increased automation of warfare.]{.underline}
She thus demonstrates the value of engaging with an STS literature that,
despite focusing on security, **[to date remains little known and
mobilised by security scholars]{.underline}**. In their chapter focusing
on STS research on security practices, Kathleen Vogel et al. (2017)
emphasise [the increasing attention to knowledge (and non-knowledge)
practices as well as the challenges of carrying out STS-informed
research in the field of security]{.underline}. Unfortunately, STS
researchers studying security pay only marginal attention to research
carried out by critical security studies scholars (Evans, Leese, and
Rychnovská 2020). Similarly, CSS has thus far shown limited interest and
engagement with STS research focusing on security practices. Besides STS
works explicitly focusing on (in)security, we insist that STS has a lot
to bring to the study of security politics. CSS researchers already
acknowledge STS as a rich source of concepts and ontological approaches,
but some of this work forgets the diverse 'genealogies of STS' (Jasanoff
2012). To put it bluntly, CSS has fallen prey to a narrow focus on
Latourianism, which has collapsed STS as a whole into Actor-Network
Theory (ANT), with the latter being understood primarily as the work of
a single author, that is, Bruno Latour (1987, 2005). Latour's work has
indeed marked most of the 'new materialist' turn mentioned above (Salter
and Walters 2016). Our suggestion to read STS beyond Latour is not to
put into question the value of ANT for the study of (in)security
practices. As Pieter Lagerwaard (2020) demonstrates in his contribution,
there is still much to be gained in engaging with Latour's works and ANT
more generally (cf. also Bellanova 2017), and to connect them with work
on 'boundary objects' (Star and Griesemer 1989). But [the success of ANT
within CSS risks failing to appreciate the differences and divergences
within ANT]{.underline} (Latour 1999; Law and Hassard 1999) and across
diverse STS approaches (Bijker and Law 1992). Importantly, [it also
risks missing the chance to take the trouble to engage with, and thus
discover, the heuristic and political potential of many other approaches
such as feminist and post-colonial technoscience]{.underline} (see
Hayles 1999; Harding 2009), those exploring the co-production of science
and society (Jasanoff 2004) as well as work on the social construction
of technology (Bijker 1995) and the design and deployment of large
technological systems (Hughes 1987). The conceptual [exchange The
growing interest of STS in IR is also due to the fact that it speaks to
adjacent trends.]{.underline} These trends include an emphasis on the
socio-political significance of [the seemingly mundane]{.underline}
(Guillaume and Huysmans 2018; Lisle and Johnson 2019), **[the conditions
of possibility for politics and contestation]{.underline}** (Mandelmaum,
Friis Kristensen, and Athanassiou 2016; Monsees 2019[), and the need for
creative methods and deeper methodological reflection
(]{.underline}Aradau et al. 2015; Naumes 2015). Recent conceptual
exchange with IR also places an emphasis on those entanglements
(Bellanova and Fuster 2013; Voelkner 2011) and processes (Jackson and
Nexon 1999; Passoth and Rowland 2010) that create both the 'state' and
the 'international', which make them look like frictionless wholes.
Advancing existing work that draws on STS to emphasise 'entanglements',
Rothe's article (2020) shows how these insights are useful in developing
an analytical framework through which to better appreciate local
entanglements that partly consist of technology, in his case, explored
through the case of jellyfish-killer robots. Rune Saugmann (2020)
discusses in his contribution how entanglements joining cameras, the
police, media and audiences play out in different contexts,
demonstrating how the assumed factuality of pictures can be contested.
This leads him to explore what it means to make claims about the agency
of the digital camera. Saugmann thereby contributes to a long-standing
debate in STS on the question of agency of objects. Although these
questions have also been discussed in IR (Hoijtink and Leese 2019,
Lindskov Jacobsen and Monsees 2019), Saugmann's original contribution
highlights the need to think about what it means politically to talk
about digital cameras' agency. Indeed, [methodological insights stemming
from STS have been used to analyse world politics beyond the realm of
science and technology]{.underline}. As contributions to this Special
Issue demonstrate, STS can be of value for a range of themes not
primarily associated with STS such as disinformation (Monsees 2020) or
financial regulations (Lagerwaard 2020). What emerges from reading
across the diverse contributions to this Special Issue is that the
relation between researchers and research objects is of special concern
when we take the trouble to analyse the roles of science and technology
in security practices (see also de Goede 2020). Besides seeking new ways
of politicising, critiquing and raising novel questions, [it is also
important to emphasise **that 'taking the trouble'** to engage with STS
also **enables us to see different things that can then be politicised
and explored critically**]{.underline} -- for example, the use of tweets
as evidence in court cases (Anwar 2020), or the role of roadblocks and
prisons in intervention practices (Schouten 2019; Lindskov Jacobsen
2020), to name but a few. [The relation between researchers and research
objects can be best understood as a dynamic process that starts with our
research apparatus]{.underline} (methods). Such an understanding invites
[us to better conceptualise the politics that are at stake in our
research and to clarify what practices we are examining]{.underline}, if
not directly partaking in, through our research. The contributions to
this Special Issue all highlight that [the encounter between STS and CSS
affects our methods, politics and practices -- i.e., the perspective we
choose, how we do research, and with which consequences. Studying
security politics and **practices requires methodological reflections**,
especially in contexts where secrecy and unknowns are **constitutive of
the dominant security and surveillance practices**]{.underline} (Balmer
2012; de Goede, Bosma, and Pallister-Wilkins 2019; Walters 2015). As a
result, this Special Issue is not only relevant because of its [analysis
of timely empirical issues -- like disinformation, terror financing and
terror fighting]{.underline} -- but also because it fosters [debate
about methodological questions and **what kind of trouble is caused by
deploying authors and concepts from**]{.underline} STS. In different
ways, these articles demonstrate how [taking the trouble with STS and
thinking with STS **enriches our methodologies and modes of critical
scholarship**]{.underline}. Two contributions in particular explicitly
show how engaging with STS insights adds to ongoing debates about doing
critique in critical security studies (Austin, Bellanova, and Kaufmann
2019; Berling and Bueger 2017; Koddenbrock 2014). de Goede (2020)
invites us to think of the '[practice' of critique as a form of
'**communing,'**]{.underline} which for Stengers [means 'participating
in an ongoing, adventurous, unguaranteed, but generative process of
making sense in common']{.underline} (Stengers 2019, 18, cited in de
Goede 2020). Suchman (2020) demonstrates how technoscientific claims
about accuracy presented as evidence of an ethical approach to warfare
are fallacious, and that their core function is legitimating further
violence.

Beyond this immediate context, [action is needed to prevent future armed
conflict]{.underline} and threats of nuclear war.¶ [Instead of
maintaining opposing military alliances]{.underline}, [all parties
should engage in building a]{.underline} common, [demilitarised security
strategy that places cooperation and the collective fulfilment of the
needs of people]{.underline} and planet [in the forefront of all
policies and actions. NATO]{.underline}, for example, **[should be
disbanded and non-militarised]{.underline}**, non-divisive alliances for
peace and cooperation should be built instead, with international
solidarity as its guiding principle. All countries should reduce their
military spending immediately, and agree to phased reductions through
the implementation of Article 26 of the UN Charter, the mandate for
which should be taken from the UN Security Council and given to the UN
General Assembly.¶ All countries should join the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and work urgently for the timebound
elimination of all nuclear weapons. Through the treaty's provisions for
disarmament, the elimination of nuclear weapons could be pursued through
verifiable process and achieved within a decade. The process of nuclear
weapon abolition could provide a foundational path to broader changes in
the world order. Eliminating nuclear weapons would help establish a new
cooperative paradigm in international relations and free up resources
help address the climate crisis. It would also help generate momentum
for broader disarmament and demilitarisation and redirection of money
and human ingenuity towards meeting human and planetary needs.¶ At the
core of our efforts, [we must put the lives of civilians and care for
the planet above perceived military]{.underline}, political, [and
economic interests]{.underline}. To this end, **[a people-centred peace
process is imperative]{.underline}**. As Almut Rochowanaski writes,"We
must apply the lessons of 21st-century peacebuilding to create a peace
process that is people-centred, women-led and rights-based." [Without
this, "patterns of exclusion and victimisation will not be
remedied]{.underline}, and memories of pain and injustice will turn into
grievance and alienation lasting generations. A broad range of
stakeholders can be heard and validated through proven peacebuilding
practices, and can go on to build a different future for their
country."¶ In the Ukraine context, we echo the call of the Ukrainian
Pacificist Movement for "open, inclusive and comprehensive negotiations
on peace and disarmament in the format of a public dialogue between all
state and non-state parties to the conflict with the participation of
pro-peace civil society actors." [This type of inclusive process, a
process that is not driven or dominated by those who created the crisis
in the first place, must be applied to other contexts]{.underline}. [We
know that more inclusive processes lead to more stable peace, yet time
after time, only men with guns dictate the terms of "peace". These
solutions invariably lead to the imposition of neoliberal economic
policies]{.underline}, gender and racial oppressions and inequalities,
**[and endless militarisation]{.underline}**.¶ [The old ways of doing
things have proven]{.underline} over and over again that [they do not
work. We need a new vision of global peace, grounded in the
intersectional experiences of people and the needs of the entire
planet.]{.underline} **[Creating and achieving that vision requires
changing who is invited to the table: out with the ruling
elites,]{.underline}** who are bound to personal interests and gains,
**[and in with everyone who stands to lose from conflict]{.underline}**.
Land and water protectors, feminists, antinuclear activists, those
organising for demilitarisation, equality, and care must lead the work
for peace, not the people who profit from conflict.¶ Abolition for
transformation ¶ **[We need a paradigm shift in international relations,
stemming from this kind of people-centred peace process.]{.underline}**
We need to alter the relations between United States and Russia, but
more broadly **[we need to dismantle the militarised global order,
militarised conceptions of security, and the dominance of the
military-industrial complex over world affairs]{.underline}**. The
hegemony of colonial-corporate extractivism must also be transformed ---
for the climate, for relations with First Nations, for the protection of
land, water, air, and animals.¶ [An abolitionist framing is useful for
cultivating such transformation]{.underline}. **[Instead of investing in
weapons and preparing for war, we must be investing instead of care for
people and planet.]{.underline}** Abolition is a tool to build a world
that works for all, instead of just a few. [The abolition of
war]{.underline}, globally, [requires]{.underline} disarmament and arms
control, systems for [demilitarisation]{.underline} [and reduction of
military spending]{.underline}. [But it also requires building
structures for peace]{.underline}, solidarity, cooperation, and
nonviolence to flourish. [It means replacing]{.underline} weapons with
renewable energy, [war with diplomacy, capitalism with a redistributive
feminist political economy that is centered on equality]{.underline},
social justice, degrowth and ecological sustainability.¶ **[Unlearning
the necessity of violence is essential to exploring what could be built
in its place]{.underline}**. **[This means turning on its head so much
of what we are taught about what's necessary for safety and security in
our world]{.underline}**. **[It means learning to reject violence as a
solution to all problems, interrogating and challenging systems of power
that assert they exist to protect while instead they persecute and
oppress.]{.underline}**¶ [Understanding and responding to the "bigger
picture]{.underline}" doesn't mean we each as individuals need to solve
every piece of it. But it [does mean we need to recognise and support
each other's efforts and reflect in our own work the analysis and
organising of various movements and projects for peace]{.underline}. The
sum of our whole is greater than our parts, and going up against the
machine of capitalist violence can feel immense --- unless we break it
down and rebuild something else, together.

#### Critical resistance in educational spaces is the key first step to raise consciousness and build alternate worlds for an egalitarian future- we must start by resisting militarism and imperialism

Although crucial, [resistance alone is not enough to stop
globalized]{.underline}¶ [neoliberalism]{.underline}, in education or
more widely across societies. Stopping neoliberal¶ reforms through
resistance is a necessary, initial step. [There is an urgent need
to]{.underline}¶ [go beyond]{.underline} such resistance [and to build a
global revolt]{.underline}, across societies, **[to]{.underline}**¶
**[struggle against the class war being waged by the ruling
class]{.underline}** on their futures,¶ [and to create]{.underline} the
[other]{.underline}, alternative, societies and [worlds, based on social
justice]{.underline},¶ that are necessary and possible. \'Critical
educators can indeed recognize that¶ [education has the potential to
fuel the flames of resistance to global capitalism]{.underline}¶ [as
well as the passion for socialist transformation\']{.underline} (Hill,
2006).¶ Peter McLaren (2003) says: [\'Schools]{.underline} consciously
and unconsciously [justify]{.underline}¶ [oppression and the tyranny of
governments]{.underline}. Government officials claim that¶ schools in
capitalist societies such as the United States are equal and that as¶
long as students remain comfortably ensconced within the cultural
hegemony of¶ consumerism, and adhere to the dictates of the
administration (which are meant¶ to be in tandem with the logic of the
market), the country can enhance the value¶ of its international capital
and can compete within the international market\'.¶ [This provides a
useful description of imperialism**, as justified and
driven**]{.underline}¶ **[through militarism in
education.]{.underline}** I agree with Saltman (2007) when he says:
[\'The]{.underline}¶ [movement against militarism]{.underline} in
education [must go beyond the schools and]{.underline}¶ [challenge the
many ways that militarism as a cultural logic enforces the]{.underline}¶
[expansion of corporate power]{.underline} and decimates public power.
**[Such a movement]{.underline}**¶ **[must include the practice of
critical pedagogy]{.underline}** and ideally, also link with other¶
movements against oppression, such as the anti-globalization, feminist,
labor, ¶ environmental, and antiracism movements. Together, we can form
the basis for¶ imagining and implementing a just future.\'¶ As
Dinerstein and Denuline (2012) suggest: [\'Hope is a fundamental
human]{.underline}¶ [driving force]{.underline}. The principle of hope
has a two-fold significance. On the one¶ hand, it informs present
individual and collective forms of resistance that intend¶ to move
beyond global capitalism. It presents an alternative vision to¶
development that will not come about through state power. Alternatives
to¶ development initiatives have put at the center not only the
significance of¶ nature, the collective use of natural resources, the
construction of a solidarity¶ economy, the idea of substantive equality
and radical democracy (Santos and¶ Rodriguez Garavito, 2006), but also
the idea that it is necessary to imagine¶ another world in order to
change this one (Acosta, 2010). By imagining we¶ mean the concrete
experience of anticipating a better future in the present.\'¶ Hannah
Arendt (1954), proposes that '[education is the point at which we
decide]{.underline}¶ [whether we love the world enough to assume
responsibility for it']{.underline}. As Freire¶ claims: [\'Man\'s
onotological vocation is to be a Subject who acts upon and]{.underline}¶
[transforms his world, and in so doing moves toward ever new
possibilities of]{.underline}¶ [fuller]{.underline} and richer
[life]{.underline} individually and collectively\' (Shaull, 2004). \'
[It is our duty]{.underline},¶ in building this better world, [to become
fully human]{.underline}".¶ Overall, as I have been arguing through this
paper, [capitalism in recent decades]{.underline}¶ [has been becoming
more aggressive and totalitarian]{.underline}. **[Education has
been]{.underline}**¶ **[suffering from imperialism and militarism along
with other sections of society]{.underline}**.¶ [In order for change to
happen, one must never abandon hope. Fear and despair]{.underline}¶ [is
the basis for an immobilized society that will passively accept the
ruling]{.underline}¶ [class's dictums. **This is something we cannot
allow for the sake of humanity**]{.underline}¶ **[itself]{.underline}**.
**[Critical Pedagogy]{.underline}**, even in the darkest times, **[is
connected to hope by]{.underline}** ¶ **[definition, since it visions
another world that is possible and struggles for it]{.underline}**. For¶
as Brecht said:¶ In the dark times¶ Will there also be singing?¶ Yes,
there will also be singing¶ About the dark times.¶ **[Critical pedagogy
is one of the strongest powers for social change, for it
builds]{.underline}**¶ **[in the minds of the future

### Alt Solves Imperialism

#### The alternative is key to countering the domination of imperialism- we must focus analysis on understanding the structures and points of crisis that legitimize the military and capital expansion- this knowledge results in effective struggles against exploitation

[Imperialism today]{.underline}, in the early twenty-first century, [has
a dual,]{.underline} contradictory [character whose dialectical
resolution is an outcome of its very nature]{.underline}---[a product of
its growth]{.underline}¶ [and expansion]{.underline} across time and
space **[within the confines of a structure that promotes
its]{.underline}**¶ **[own demise]{.underline}**. However, while the
process itself is a self-destructing one, it is important to¶ understand
that [the nature of the class struggle that these contradictions have
generated]{.underline}¶ [is such that the critical factor that tips the
balance of class forces in favor of the working]{.underline}¶ [class to
win state power is strong political organization]{.underline}, the
building of class alliances¶ among the oppressed and exploited classes,
[the development of a theoretically wellinformed revolutionary
leadership]{.underline} that is organically linked to the working class,
**[and]{.underline}**¶ **[a clear understanding of the forces at work in
the class struggle,]{.underline}** **[including
especially]{.underline}**¶ **[the central role of the state and its
military and police apparatus]{.underline}** [in defense of
the]{.underline}¶ [empire]{.underline}---the focal point of the struggle
for state power (Szymanski 1978; Knapp and¶ Spector 2011). [The success
of the working class]{.underline} and its revolutionary leadership [in
confronting the power of the imperialist state thus becomes the critical
element assuring that]{.underline}¶ [once captured, the]{.underline} new
proletarian [state can become a political instrument that
the]{.underline}¶ [workers can use to establish their rule]{.underline}
and in the process transform society and the¶ state itself [to promote
proletarian interests in line with its vision for a new
socialist]{.underline}¶ [society free of exploitation]{.underline} and
oppression---one based on the rule of the working¶ class and the
laboring masses in general.¶ [The necessity for]{.underline} change and
social [transformation]{.underline}, which is a political one,
**[demands]{.underline}**¶ **[a clear, scientific understanding of
modern imperialism]{.underline}** in its late twentieth and early¶
twenty-first century form, **[so that this knowledge can be put to use
to facilitate the]{.underline}**¶ **[class struggle in a revolutionary
direction.]{.underline}** In this context, **[one will want to know
not]{.underline}**¶ **[only the extent and depth of global capitalist
expansion, but its base of support, its linkage]{.underline}**¶ **[to
the major institutions of capitalist society]{.underline}** (above all
the state, but also other religious,¶ cultural, and social
institutions), [the extent of its ideological hegemony and control
over]{.underline}¶ [mass consciousness, and other aspects
of]{.underline} social, economic, political, cultural, and [ideological
domination. Moreover]{.underline}---and this is the most important
point---**[one must study]{.underline}**¶ **[its
weaknesses]{.underline}**, its problem areas, its vulnerabilities, its
weak links, **[and the various]{.underline}**¶ **[dimensions of its
crisis]{.underline}**---especially those that affect its continued
reproduction and survival. [Armed with this knowledge one would be
better equipped to confront capital and]{.underline}¶ [the capitalist
state in the struggle to transform capitalist globalization and
imperialism in]{.underline}¶ [the twenty-first century]{.underline}.
Together, **[these struggles have been effective in frustrating
the]{.underline}**¶ **[efforts of imperialism to expand and dominate the
world]{.underline}**, [while at the same time building]{.underline}¶
[the basis of an international working class movement]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} finally [overcomes]{.underline} national,¶ ethnic,
cultural, and linguistic boundaries that artificially separate the
workers in their¶ fight against [imperialism]{.underline}. The
solidarity achieved through [this process has helped]{.underline}
[expand]{.underline}¶ the strength of [the international working class
and increased its determination to defeat]{.underline}¶ [imperialism and
all vestiges of global capitalism throughout the world and build a
new]{.underline}¶ [egalitarian world social order that advances the
interests of the working people and ultimately all of
humanity]{.underline}.

### Alt Solves NATO/GPW

#### Capitalist imperialism provides the best framework for understanding NATO and international conflict- it is a result of the generation of economic contradictions and the necessity of countries to protect market access

Alex **Callinicos in 2022**

political theorist and activist; The great power grab---imperialism and
the war in Ukraine; Socialist Worker;
https://socialistworker.co.uk/features/the-great-power-grab-imperialism-and-war-in-ukraine/

The mainstream media present the war in Ukraine as a struggle between
"democracy", represented by Ukraine and its Western backers, and
"authoritarianism" in the shape of Vladimir Putin's regime in Russia.
But this is much too simplistic.¶ For example, probably Ukraine's most
enthusiastic backer is the far right government in Poland, which is
under investigation by the European Union for its authoritarian
tendencies. Putin is supported by India, which, despite its own brutish
fascist ­government, remains a multi-party democracy.¶ [The mainstream
way of framing the conflict is designed to equate the Western bloc of
liberal capitalist states with the "international community".It is also
a way of denying ­legitimacy to the interests of this bloc's rivals
because they are "authoritarian."]{.underline} This gets forgotten
however when it comes to, for example, the murderous Saudi autocracy.¶
So are there [better theoretical ­frameworks for understanding the
conflict?]{.underline} One resource [is provided by the idea of
imperialism]{.underline}. After all, Putin seems intent on restoring the
old Tsarist Empire that was destroyed by the Russian Revolution of
October 1917.¶ But it's important to clear about what we mean by
[imperialism]{.underline}. We can ­understand it as a phenomenon that
spans historical eras, as the way in which powerful states dominate,
­conquer, and exploit neighbouring societies.¶ This [has been a feature
of class ­societies for thousands of years]{.underline}, going back to
the ancient Persian, Chinese, and Roman empires. Now Russia is clearly
behaving like an imperialist power in this sense, seeking to batter the
Ukrainian state into ­submission and carve up its territory. But is it
enough to understand the ­conflict in these terms?¶ The Lebanese Marxist
Gilbert Achcar thinks so. He has put forward what he calls a "radical
anti-imperialist position" that focuses exclusively on the struggle
between Russia and Ukraine.¶ "A successful Russian ­takeover of Ukraine
would encourage the United States to return to the path of ­conquering
the world by force in a ­context of ­exacerbation of the new colonial
division of the world and worsening of global antagonisms, while a
Russian ­failure---adding to the US failures in Iraq and
Afghanistan---would reinforce what is called in Washington the 'Vietnam
syndrome'.¶ "Moreover, it seems quite obvious to me that a Russian
victory would ­considerably strengthen warmongering and the push towards
increased military spending in Nato countries, which has already gotten
off to a flying start, while a Russian defeat would offer much better
conditions for our battle for general disarmament and the dissolution of
Nato."¶ [It would indeed be good if the Ukrainian people were able to
drive out the Russian invaders. But there is a small problem with
Achcar's argument that this would weaken the US and Nato]{.underline}.
**[They are enthusiastically backing the Ukrainians, flooding them with
arms, and boosting their own military budgets]{.underline}**. ¶
[If]{.underline}, thanks to these efforts and the courage of the
Ukrainian fighters, [Russia were defeated, would the US and its allies
react by disarming and dissolving Nato? Of course they wouldn't.They
would celebrate]{.underline} this outcome as their victory, [and boost
Nato further]{.underline}. [The US would feel invigorated in its
world-historic competition with the]{.underline} real challenger to its
hegemony, [China]{.underline}.¶ [What is missing from]{.underline}
Achcar's approach, and that of other [leftists that duck the issue of
Nato]{.underline} such as Paul Mason, [is the more historically specific
understanding of imperialism offered by Marxism]{.underline}. We can see
this theory emerging ­originally in Karl Marx's Capital in the 1860s. But
it is developed more ­systematically in the early 20th century, around
the time of the First World War.¶ Marxists were confronted with a
­reality similar to our own. The radical liberal economist JA Hobson
wrote, "The novelty of recent Imperialism ... consists chiefly in its
adoption by several nations. The notion of a number of competing empires
is essentially modern."¶ This [geopolitical competition was expressed in
conflicts over territory]{.underline}---the colonies and semi-colonies
that the ­biggest states were striving to dominate--- [and in an
accelerating arms race]{.underline}. [The Marxist theory of imperialism
was developed to explain these ­rivalries]{.underline}, which
precipitated the two world wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45, drowning the
world in blood.¶ [It was a theory of capitalist
­imperialism.]{.underline} The Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin
called imperialism the highest stage of capitalism. His Polish-German
comrade Rosa Luxemburg wrote, "[The essence of imperialism consists
­precisely in the expansion of capital from the old capitalist countries
into new regions and the competitive]{.underline} economic and political
[struggle among those for those new areas.]{.underline}"¶ To put it
another way, [capitalist imperialism represents the ­intersection of
economic and geopolitical competition]{.underline}. **[Economic
competition is the driving force of capitalism]{.underline}**---[rival
firms]{.underline} ­[struggle against each other]{.underline}, investing
in improved and expanded production to seize a larger share of markets.¶
In the late 19th century, **[the ­geopolitical struggle among states was
subsumed under the capitalist logic of competitive
accumulation.]{.underline}**¶ [This reflected changes in both warfare
and capitalism. War was industrialised,]{.underline} as military power
came to depend on mass ­production to arm, support, and transport huge
armies. [States therefore needed to ­promote industrial
capitalism.]{.underline} ¶ **[Meanwhile capitalist firms increased in
size and started to operate globally]{.underline}**. [They depended on
state support against their rivals.]{.underline} During the depression
of the late 19th century, seizing overseas colonies ­compensated for
falling profitability.¶ So [capitalist imperialism]{.underline} isn't
just big states bullying and conquering smaller states---though there is
plenty of that. It['s a global system of inter-capitalist
­competition]{.underline}. Just as before the First World War, **[today
imperialism means geopolitical competition against the background of
global economic integration.]{.underline}**¶ The power of the
antagonists depends on their position in the capitalist world economy.
The US dominates finance and big tech, China has a vast manufacturing
machine, and Russia relies on energy exports. Today one can identify
perhaps six leading imperialist powers---the US, China, Russia, Britain,
France, and Germany.¶ [The most important antagonism is that between the
US and China]{.underline} whose leaders aim to displace Washington's
hegemony, initially in the Indo-Pacific region. [But Russian
imperialism]{.underline}, ­manoeuvring to rebuild its power, [creates a
three‑way conflict]{.underline}. ¶ [The big ­western European powers are
pulled in different directions. They depend on Russian energy and are
attracted by the vast Chinese market]{.underline}---but, as at present,
they ­ultimately line up with the US. Now this understanding of
­capitalist imperialism as involving a system of interstate rivalry is
completely missing from Achcar's analysis.¶ He denies that the Ukraine
war involves a conflict among imperialist powers. "If any war where each
side is supported by an imperialist rival were called an
inter-imperialist war, then all the wars of our time would be
­inter-imperialist, since as a rule, it is enough for one of the rival
imperialisms to support one side for the other to support the opposite
side.¶ "An inter-imperialist war is not that. It is a direct war, and
not one by proxy, between two powers, each of which seeks to invade the
territorial and (neo) colonial domain of the other." This is much too
narrow. The US waged a proxy war against the Soviet Union after the
latter tried to seize Afghanistan at the end of 1979¶ Along with allies
such as Britain, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan it armed and trained the
mujahedin fighters who resisted the Soviet occupation. The ­conflict
helped to drain Soviet resources and morale in the last decade of the
Cold War. Of course, the mujahedin had their own political agendas. This
became clear after Soviet forces withdrew in 1989, culminating in the
Taliban's ­support for al-Qaeda and its resistance to the US occupation
following the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. ¶ But the US
played a decisive shaping role in an important final episode of the Cold
War. Of course, there are huge differences between Ukraine today and
Afghanistan in the 1980s.¶ But there is an important similarity, in that
the [Western imperialist powers are instrumentalising the Ukrainian
national struggle against Russian imperialism for their own
interests]{.underline}.¶ [Inter-imperialist struggles and wars of
national defence often interweave.]{.underline} The First World War
started when the Austro-Hungarian Empire attacked Serbia, which it
blamed for the assassination of its crown prince Franz Ferdinand. Russia
then backed Serbia, leading to an escalating process of military
mobilisations that ended in a ­terrible general war.¶ The German Marxist
Karl Kautsky argued that the role played by the Serbian struggle for
national ­self‑­determination meant the conflict wasn't just an
­imperialist war. Lenin responded, "To Serbia, i.e., to perhaps one
percent or so of the ­participants in the present war, the war is a
'continuation of the politics' of the bourgeois-liberation movement. ¶
"To the other ninety-nine percent, the war is a continuation of the
politics of imperialism." Of course, the balance is ­different in the
present case since the direct ­fighting involves just Ukraine and
Russia.¶ [Nevertheless the Nato powers' efforts to stay out of the
fighting]{.underline}---above all to avoid nuclear confrontation with
Russia---**[don't alter the fact they are doing ­everything they can
short of this to defeat Russia. This too is "a continuation of the
­politics of imperialism".]{.underline}**¶ [The Marxist theory of
imperialism is important politically. Without it we are confronted
simply with a struggle between rival nation-states]{.underline}. **[But
once we see the role of ­imperialism, we can identify the class
antagonism at work]{.underline}**. [We can see the thread of class
interest that binds together not just the Russian conscripts dying in
Putin's war and their families back home being walloped economically by
the effects of Western sanctions.]{.underline}¶ [This thread also
connects with ­working people all over the world]{.underline}, hit thanks
to the war by food and energy inflation and **[threatened with nuclear
destruction]{.underline}**. It unites them all against the rival ruling
classes busy feeding this terrible war.

### At: Policy Key

#### Policy changes will not stop the impacts of militarism- only a paradigm shift that recognizes the necessity of breaking away from militarist ideology solves

[Capitalism]{.underline}, at least as it is organized and practiced in
the United States[, is]{.underline}¶ [perhaps the deepest-rooted and
widest-reaching system that perpetuates]{.underline}¶ [the
Racism-Militarism Paradigm]{.underline}. [In its prioritization of
the]{.underline} interests of¶ shareholders over workers, its
socialization of costs and privatization of¶ profits, its focus on
[short-term profits over long-term gains]{.underline}, and its failure¶
to invest in human capital, [the U.S. system of capitalism is
inextricably]{.underline}¶ [intertwined with racism and
exploitation.]{.underline}¶ [It has resulted in a carbon-based economy
that is exceptionally reliant on]{.underline}¶ [the arms]{.underline}
and extractive and carceral [industries]{.underline}; a government that
has failed¶ to address climate change or promote climate justice in any
meaningful¶ way; and a population that suffers from extreme gaps in
health, wealth, and¶ income. The constant search for new sources of
cheap labor, the competition¶ for access to natural resources, and the
need for ever-expanding markets has¶ led to human and environmental
degradation, military expansionism, and¶ the promotion of consumerism.¶
[Closely associated with the capitalist system are the
laws]{.underline}, policies, and¶ regulations [that enable its most
detrimental impacts]{.underline}. A regressive tax system¶ that
tolerates massive tax evasion and avoidance by wealthy individuals¶ and
corporations has left federal coffers without resources to spend on the
common good. [The excessive influence of the
military-industrial-carceralcongressional complex has led to
a]{.underline} massive network of prisons and detention¶ centers, a
[huge global military footprint, and an unrestrained arms
race]{.underline} and¶ bloated Pentagon budgets.¶ [War has become a
permanent and largely unchallenged reality]{.underline}, **[with arms
exports]{.underline}**¶ **[now determining many foreign policy
priorities]{.underline}**. The accelerated development¶ of weapons whose
use should be unthinkable is the new normal. The absence¶ of responsible
oversight and accountability mechanisms has given license to¶ war
profiteering, corruption, and waste---the burden of which falls upon
U.S.¶ taxpayers, disproportionately among the poor and middle class.¶
But it is not just the formal state structures and government policies
that¶ operate to maintain white supremacy and advance U.S. global
military¶ supremacy. Christian, white, male dominance and military
solutions are also¶ bolstered by nonprofit organizations, religious and
cultural institutions, the¶ media, the education system, and
multilateral institutions such as the United¶ Nations and the
International Monetary Fund (where power and influence¶ are based upon
national wealth, privileging the ruling elites of the G7¶ countries,
which combined represent only 10% of the world's population).¶ These
institutions often unwittingly perpetuate the same exclusionary and¶
exploitative practices as the U.S. government and U.S.-based
corporations,¶ and they encourage individual obedience to and compliance
with those¶ practices. They generally tell the stories that those with
power and privilege¶ want to be told. Many of them advocate, tolerate,
or commit violence;¶ replicate racialized hierarchies; and socialize
narratives and myths that¶ support the Racism-Militarism Paradigm.¶
**[Injustice of this magnitude will not be rectified by mere policy
change]{.underline}**. Even¶ though transitions of administration and
party control of Congress can¶ result in meaningful policy shifts,
**[the range of possible options is tightly]{.underline}**¶
**[constrained by this pre-existing set of beliefs and assumptions about
the]{.underline}**¶ **[world and the U.S. role in it]{.underline}**.
**[What is needed is paradigm change]{.underline}**. **[When
we]{.underline}**¶ **[speak of dismantling racism and militarism in U.S.
foreign policy, we are]{.underline}**¶ **[talking about the work of
paradigm change.]{.underline}**¶ [A paradigm is a distinct set of
concepts and rules that establish boundaries]{.underline}¶ [and dictate
behavior.]{.underline} **[It is a theoretical framework that informs the
processes]{.underline}**¶ **[of defining U.S. national
interests,]{.underline}** establishing foreign policy priorities,¶
**[determining the distribution of resources, and conceptualizing
national]{.underline}**¶ **[security. And this is what must be
changed.]{.underline}**

### Alt Solves-Imperialism

#### Centering a critical reading of imperialism is key to unite theory and praxis- it moves analysis beyond the nation-state and gives us the tools needed to carve out spaces of resistance

Anthony **Pahnke in 2021**

Associate Professor of International Relations at San Francisco State
University; Regrounding Critical Theory: Lenin on Imperialism,
Nationalism, and Strategy; International Studies Review, Volume 23,
Issue 1, March 2021, Pages 181--203;
https://academic.oup.com/isr/article/23/1/181/5850500

The argument put forward in this article is that [we need to recapture
key elements from the Critical Theoretic
tradition]{.underline}---namely, [a concern with
strategy]{.underline}---[to explore the nature of emancipation in our
current historical moment]{.underline}. I agree with others who
recognize the indispensable place of First Generation Frankfurt School
thinkers in this tradition (Yalvaç 2015), yet also see the need to
recognize that the Critical Theoretic project predates their work. [Marx
and Engels]{.underline}, for example**[, are integral, for not only
providing concepts to analyze social relations, but also for intervening
into affairs]{.underline}** in ways similar to some ethnographers
(Murphy 2007, 131--132). [Marx\'s]{.underline} often referenced eleventh
[thesis]{.underline} on Feuerbach---[philosophers have only interpreted
the world,]{.underline} in various ways; [the point is to change
it]{.underline}---[includes a proviso that sits at the center of work on
emancipation]{.underline}. Specifically, contemplation is insufficient
for changing social relations. [Emancipation]{.underline}, in following
Fraser\'s understanding of the concept, i[s rooted in ambivalent claims
of social movements to "erode" some form of domination in favor of
transformation]{.underline} (2013). [Ambivalence combines with
transformation because there are no guarantees when seeking
emancipation---collective efforts to fundamentally alter social
relations may end in defeat or reversal]{.underline}. Kevin Anderson
recognizes such qualities in Lenin\'s efforts to connect theoretic work
with practical activity, leading him to state that the Russian
Revolutionary deserves greater attention in the Critical Theory
tradition (1995).¶ [My central argument]{.underline}, in building from
Anderson\'s comment, **[foregrounds Lenin\'s work as a way to reground
Critical Theory.]{.underline}** The reason I turn to Lenin is analogous
to Fraser\'s concern that **[we cannot reckon with our many
crises]{.underline}**---political, economic, and environmental---**[with
the received thinking from the regularly cited Critical
Theorists]{.underline}** (2017). Yet, where Fraser turns to Polanyi, [I
**propose calling upon Lenin, with special attention to his theorization
of and political practice concerning imperialism**]{.underline}. [His
multi-dimensional work around the concept]{.underline}, from writing
theoretical texts and pamphlets, to organizing conferences and events
(e.g., The Third Communist International, or Comintern), [provides a way
to reconsider the Critical Theoretic tradition within International
Relations]{.underline}. [Intrinsic to Lenin\'s work]{.underline}, as I
argue, [is a way to conceive of strategy. This concept,]{.underline}
which speaks to Marxist discussions of praxis, **[ties abstract
theorizing to political and economic analysis, as well as to movement
building projects]{.underline}**. [Critical Theory]{.underline} of the
Frankfurt School variety and after [has moved steadily away from
discussions of strategy to the promotion of dialogue]{.underline}.
**[This tendency represents depoliticization]{.underline}**,
**[which]{.underline}** as Schmitt described, [elevates neutrality and
privacy as values]{.underline} (\[2008\] 1929, 89--90). This development
also characterizes some seemingly radical endorsements of civil
society.¶ This article contains five parts. In the first and the second,
I detail the Theory of Communicative Action, featuring Habermas and
Honneth, while also including the work of some International Relations
theorists. I argue that t[his popular current of thought in the
discipline depoliticizes Critical Theory by neglecting strategic
considerations on internationalism]{.underline}, while also reifying the
state/society divide. Section 3 focuses on the research of Cox and
Ashley, as well as others, locating the presence of a more
internationalist and engaged political sensibility within Critical
Theory when compared to the proponents of Habermas' discourse ethics.
Still, these works feature flawed assumptions pertaining to civil
society and political engagement. The fourth section introduces
[Lenin\'s thought as a way to address these concerns, particularly his
work on imperialism. I offer a political reading of his
work]{.underline}---both the famous pamphlet, as well as his extensive
notebooks on the concept---[detailing his preoccupation with organizers,
intellectuals, and movements]{.underline}. [I return to how nationalism
connects to liberation]{.underline} in the fourth and fifth sections.
[Lenin\'s dual understanding of nationalism]{.underline}---[as
potentially]{.underline} a [conservative]{.underline} force
[and]{.underline} an [emancipatory]{.underline} one---[moves us beyond
taking the nation as the principal unit of politics]{.underline}. I do
not argue for rejecting nationalism as a collective political project,
but with Lenin\'s insights, show how [such movements can bridge with
more emancipatory struggles]{.underline}. Ultimately, [Lenin pushes
discussions of emancipation into moving beyond the state and the
nation.]{.underline}

This article places key elements of Lenin\'s thought in discussion with

reflection---leads theorists to wall themselves off from

contemplating of affairs.]{.underline} Habermas, a principal voice in
this variety of Critical Theory, advocates for dialogue as the preferred
mode of social interaction. Such positions are blind to our historical
moment when conflict and taking sides is the norm, on the right and the
left.¶ [Central pillars of Critical Theory---a concern with emancipation
and the understanding that concepts must work against
domination---remain relevant]{.underline}. Frankfurt School theorists,
such as Horkheimer, is particularly instructive in this regard.
Fraser\'s work, as well, offers a way to conceptualize Critical Theory
as a project for emancipation that is rooted in connecting with social
movement struggles. [To further improve]{.underline} our understanding
of how [this connection]{.underline} can take place, **[turning to
Lenin]{.underline}**, as I argue, **[is crucial]{.underline}**.
[Lenin\'s thought on imperialism offers a way for us to rethink the
place of theory when it comes to the importance of making strategic
interventions in political]{.underline} [life]{.underline}, especially
concerning questions pertaining to territory. In this regard, [Lenin
highlights the central,]{.underline} [yet problematic necessity of
working with the state]{.underline}, **[while also confronting movement
divisions to build unity]{.underline}**. [In Lenin\'s hands, Critical
Theory is a tool to mobilize people]{.underline}, draw distinctions with
antagonists, [and build movement unity]{.underline}. The many ways he
practiced and theorized political action, including writing editorials,
producing abstract intellectual works, and delivering statements for
conferences, provide multiple illustrations on how to bridge social
movement activity with theory.¶ [Extreme inequality characterizes
international political economy]{.underline} and life within many
advanced capitalist states, [as we live]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
what may be considered "[a new gilded age]{.underline}." [Powerful
states and corporations are connected]{.underline}, [linked in ways that
generate uneven, global]{.underline} chains of production, exchange, and
[circulation]{.underline}. [Wars rage on]{.underline} in many parts of
the world. Global flows have brought some of us together, while at the
same time, stoked divisions within and between states. Lenin, at his
time, saw similar problems and developments. As an organizer, he worked
to build movements oriented around social transformation. He also saw
nationalist movements, on the right and the left. While supporting the
latter, he rejected the former. Furthermore, while seeing national
self-determination as a potential force, Lenin also considered its
limitations. His work on imperialism helped him reach this conclusion,
which he used to mobilize rank-and-file movement members as well as
other organizers. [Lenin\'s relevance is here]{.underline}, precisely,
**[in helping us think on how to bring people together and create unity
out of fragmentation, setting the work of emancipation on a path toward
creating new political, economic, and cultural relations.]{.underline}**

### At: War is Human Nature

#### Warfare and violence aren't a human instinct- anthropological studies prove

R. **Brian Ferguson 18** professor of Anthropology at Rutgers
University, Scientific American "War is not part of Human Nature",
<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/war-is-not-part-of-human-nature/>

[Do people]{.underline}, or perhaps just males, [have an evolved
predisposition to kill members of other groups?]{.underline} Not just a
capacity to kill but an innate propensity to take up arms, tilting us
toward collective violence? [The word "collective" is key.]{.underline}
[People fight and kill for personal reasons]{.underline}, but homicide
is not war. War is social, with groups organized to kill people from
other groups. Today controversy over the historical [roots of warfare
revolves around two polar positions.]{.underline} In one, [war is an
evolved propensity to eliminate]{.underline} any potential
[competitors.]{.underline} [In this scenario]{.underline}, humans all
the way back to [our]{.underline} common [ancestors]{.underline} with
chimpanzees [have always made war]{.underline}. [The other position
holds that armed conflict has only emerged over recent millennia, as
changing]{.underline} social [conditions provided the
motivation]{.underline} and organization [to collectively
kill]{.underline}. The two sides separate into what the late
anthropologist Keith Otterbein called hawks and doves. (This debate also
ties into the question of whether instinctive, warlike tendencies can be
detected in chimpanzees. [If war expresses an inborn
tendency]{.underline}, [then we should expect to find evidence of war
in]{.underline} [small-scale societies throughout the prehistoric
record.]{.underline} The hawks claim that we have indeed found such
evidence. "When there is a good archaeological picture of any society on
Earth, there is almost always also evidence of warfare\.... Twenty-five
percent of deaths due to warfare may be a conservative estimate," wrote
archaeologist Steven A. LeBlanc and his co-author Katherine E. Register.
With casualties of that magnitude, evolutionary psychologists argue, war
has served as a mechanism of natural selection in which the fittest
prevail to acquire both mates and resources. This perspective has
achieved broad influence. Political scientist Francis Fukuyama wrote
that the roots of recent wars and genocide go back for tens or hundreds
of thousands of years among our hunter-gatherer ancestors, even to our
shared ancestor with chimpanzees. Bradley Thayer, a leading scholar of
international relations, argues that evolutionary theory explains why
the instinctual tendency to protect one\'s tribe morphed over time into
group inclinations toward xenophobia and ethnocentrism in international
relations. [If wars are natural eruptions of]{.underline} instinctive
[hate, why look for other answers?]{.underline} If human nature leans
toward collective killing of outsiders, how long can we avoid it? The
anthropologists and archaeologists in the dove camp challenge this view.
[Humans, they argue, have an obvious capacity to engage in warfare, but
their brains are not hardwired to identify and kill outsiders involved
in collective conflicts.]{.underline} Lethal group
[attacks]{.underline}, according to these arguments, [emerged only when
hunter-gatherer societies grew in size and]{.underline} complexity and
later [with the birth of agriculture.]{.underline} Archaeology,
supplemented by observations of contemporary hunter-gatherer cultures,
allows us to identify the times and, to some degree, the social
circumstances that led to the origins and intensification of warfare. In
the search for the origins of war, archaeologists look for four kinds of
evidence. The artwork on cave walls is exhibit one. Paleolithic cave
paintings from Grottes de Cougnac, Pech Merle and Cosquer in France
dating back approximately 25,000 years show what some scholars perceive
to be spears penetrating people, suggesting that people were waging war
as early as the late Paleolithic period. But this interpretation is
contested. Other scientists point out that some of the incomplete
figures in those cave paintings have tails, and they argue that the bent
or wavy lines that intersect with them more likely represent forces of
shamanic power, not spears. (In contrast, wall paintings on the eastern
Iberian Peninsula, probably made by settled agriculturalists thousands
of years later, clearly show battles and executions.). [Debate over war
and human nature will not soon be resolved.]{.underline} The idea that
intensive, high-casualty violence was ubiquitous throughout prehistory
has many backers. It has cultural resonance for those who are sure that
we as a species naturally tilt toward war. As my mother would say: "Just
look at history!" But doves have the upper hand when all the evidence is
considered. Broadly, [early finds provide little if any evidence
suggesting war was a fact of life. People are people.]{.underline} [They
fight and sometimes kill.]{.underline} Humans have always had a capacity
to make war, if conditions and culture so dictate. [But those
conditions]{.underline} and the warlike cultures they generate [became
common only over the past 10,000 years]{.underline}---and, in most
places, much more recently than that. The high level of killing often
reported in history, ethnography or later archaeology is contradicted in
the earliest archaeological findings around the globe. The most ancient
bones and artifacts are consistent with the title of [Margaret Mead\'s
1940 article: "Warfare Is Only an Invention---Not a Biological
Necessity."]{.underline} My work [disputes the claim that chimpanzee
males have an innate tendency to kill]{.underline} outsiders,
[arguing]{.underline} instead [that]{.underline} their most extreme
[violence can be tied to]{.underline} specific [circumstances that
result from disruption of their lives by contact with
humans.]{.underline} Making that case has required my going through
every reported chimpanzee killing. From this, a simple point can be
made. Critical examination of a recent compilation of killings from 18
chimpanzee research sites---together amounting to 426 years of field
observations---reveals that of 27 observed or inferred intergroup
killings of adults and adolescents, 15 come from just two highly
conflicted situations, which occurred at two sites in 1974--1977 and
2002--2006, respectively. From comparative case studies, I conclude that
["war"]{.underline} among chimpanzees [is not an evolved]{.underline}
evolutionary [strategy but an induced response to human
disturbance.]{.underline} Case-by-case analyses will show that chimps,
as a species, are not "killer apes." This research calls into question
as well the idea that any human tendency toward bellicosity might be
driven by an ancient genetic legacy from a distant ancestor of
chimpanzees and humans. 

#### War is not part of human nature- it's only a recent social construct

[Is it in our nature to go to war?]{.underline} Should we just accept
the fact that humans have this innate tendency and are hardwired to kill
members of other groups? [No, says]{.underline} R. Brian [Ferguson,
professor of anthropology at [Rutgers
University-Newark](https://www.newark.rutgers.edu/)]{.underline}. [There
is no scientific proof that we have an inherent propensity
to]{.underline} take up arms and collectively [kill.]{.underline}In a
paper published in [Scientific
American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/war-is-not-part-of-human-nature/),
[Ferguson argues that]{.underline} war may not be in our nature at all.
[People]{.underline} might [fight]{.underline} [and
s]{.underline}ometimes [kill for personal reasons, but homicide, he
argues, is not war. Many]{.underline} scientists and scholars [believe
that humans]{.underline} as a species [are aggressive]{.underline},
brutal and bloodthirsty [and this behavior is part of our
DNA]{.underline}. Ferguson argues, [however]{.underline}, that [there is
no real indication or]{.underline} scientific [proof that humans have
been waging war for the entire history of the species."Warlike
cultures]{.underline} in some places [became common]{.underline} only
over the past 10,000 years and in most places [more
recently]{.underline} than that," Ferguson says. In his research,
Ferguson looked at cases reported as violent deaths throughout the
prehistoric record. He found that 15 percent to 25 percent of deaths
that many anthropologists and archeologists say were the result of war
may reflect cherry-picking the most violent cases, which are
contradicted by broad surveys of all archaeological sites.["Individual
killing is not the same as war on social groups]{.underline}," says
Ferguson. "[War leaves physical traces that archaeologists can
find.]{.underline} When and where it began is very different in
different places around the world, but there are stretches of even
thousands of years when there are no clear signs of war." Part of the
reason for the debate, Ferguson says, is that the evidence used to
identify prehistoric warfare -- weapons, art and cave paintings,
defensive structures and skeletal remains -- are often ambiguous and
difficult to interpret[.]{.underline} Careful examination of all
evidence typically finds no strong indication of war in early remains,
which changes to clear signs of war in later periods. Is it in our
nature to go to war? Should we just accept the fact that humans have
this innate tendency and are hardwired to kill members of other groups?
He disputes the belief of many scholars that humans may have inherited
their genetic makeup from their chimpanzee cousins millions of years
ago. After examining every reported chimpanzee killing,
[Ferguson]{.underline}, who is writing a book on the subject, [believes
that war among chimps was not an evolved evolutionary strategy but
rather a response to human contact]{.underline} and disturbances. [So
why did war become so common in more recent archaeological
finds?]{.underline} Ferguson says that [preconditions that made war more
likely became far more widespread,]{.underline} including social
hierarchy, a more sedentary existence, a growing regional population,
valuable resources and the establishment of boundaries. [These
conditions have]{.underline} sometimes [worsened]{.underline} with
severe environmental changes, he says. Ferguson, who also studies
contemporary war, brutal civil wars around the world and U.S. wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan, agrees with anthropologist Margaret Mead that
"warfare is only an invention, not a biological necessity," but does he
not see war ending."Anthropologists think about prospects for war in the
long term," Ferguson says. ["If the idea that war is part of human
nature is not scientifically supported, alternative futures open up. If
more people work for prevention, the eventual eradication of war is a
definite theoretical possibility."]{.underline}

[The emergence of the industrial revolution]{.underline} in the late
18th century, following the occupation of agrarian societies,
[was]{.underline} also [the coming of age of]{.underline} nations and
[nationalism]{.underline} (Pagano, 2013). [This]{.underline} shift
[showed the immense possibilities of]{.underline} [exploitation inherent
in cultural uniformity and war.]{.underline} The switch from having
primarily agrarian societies to industrialized communities created
differentiated access to land and its commodities, facilitating the
exercise of authority over others. [According to Pagano]{.underline}
(2013), [social mobility is hampered by cultural diversity, whereas
cultural standardization is hampered by social immobility.]{.underline}
Social mobility [and]{.underline} cultural uniformity [enabled the
exploitation of]{.underline} a wide variety of possibilities and
facilitated the powerful process of creative [destruction]{.underline}
that is a hallmark of a capitalist society (Pagano, 2013). [Societies
that were]{.underline} socially stagnant and culturally [distinct were
ultimately left behind in terms of economic growth]{.underline} and, as
a result, economic power. [Furthermore, countries that had
developed]{.underline} cultural homogeneity [were incapable of being
conquered; rather, they could]{.underline} readily
[colonize]{.underline} agrarian societies (Pagano, 2013). [People seem
to think that]{.underline} because [war]{.underline} has existed for
such a long period of time, it [must be ingrained in our
nature]{.underline} and constitute an undeniable, biological drive to
participate; as stated by the 19th Century German philosopher Friedrich
Nietzsche: "I am by nature warlike. To attack is among my instincts."
(Marlantes, 2011). [But]{.underline} this view has been rebutted ---
[war is not a drive that demands release, as food or sex do; a state
will not suffer from deprivation if it abstains from war]{.underline}
(Gat, 2019). Although battle is not a main motivation for people, this
does not imply that they are not hardwired for it. [It is hypothesized
that warfare is imprinted in humans as a tool]{.underline}, [just as
collaboration may be used to reach an agreement]{.underline} rather than
utilizing conflict or violence (Gat, 2019). Granting, cooperation would
mean working together with a different nation, which is not in our
nature, thereby possibly being an explanation for the heavy presence of
war. [Modern weaponry and extremes of money and power increase both the
costs and rewards of combat, as well as]{.underline} the extent [to
which compulsion may promote violence]{.underline} against a fighter's
self-interest (Gat, 2019). Perhaps less evident are the ramifications of
large-scale human socialization, in which people fight against one
another but also, as we know, create coalitions against other groups
(Cashdan & Downes, 2012).[Human evolution has been
influenced]{.underline} significantly [by lethal tribal
competition]{.underline}. Human social [groups have]{.underline} almost
undoubtedly [competed with one another]{.underline} throughout
humanity's civilization [for territory, food, shelter, and
mates]{.underline}. At most, the defeated communities will have lost
access to desirable territory and reserves; most unfavourably, they were
murdered by the victorious group (Clark & Winegard, 2020).

### At: Realism- Cyber

#### Realist theory is wrong- cyber power will not transform traditional power dynamics. Full blown cyber war is not a threat.

As a theory mostly concerned with issues of national security and power,
[realism would appear to be the instinctive international relations
perspective for understanding cyber conflict]{.underline}. Our analysis
suggests that realism does remain a relevant framework for identifying
important security-related issues in the cyber domain and can sometimes
provide useful insights about some enduring characteristics of
international relations. However, **[realist theories about conflict
often fall substantially short in explaining the unique dynamics of
cyber conflict.]{.underline}** In many ways, the cyber domain resembles
a realist world with its anarchical nature and lack of institutional
governance where states fear one another and develop their capabilities
in response. Yet, [it is unclear whether cyber arms races are likely to
escalate into cyber conflict]{.underline}. Realism also raises
interesting questions about cyber power, about who possesses it, and how
it relates to international stability. [In terms of whether cyber power
will transform traditional power dynamics, the evidence suggests this is
not the case.]{.underline} **[The trend]{.underline}** we have seen thus
far **[has been restrained from full-blown cyber war in favour of less
destructive forms of cyber interactions]{.underline}**. The
offense-defence balance is the clearest example of a [realist
theory]{.underline} being used to explain the cyber domain, but it
[appears empirically inaccurate in its assumptions about the cyber
domain and its predictions about cyber conflict]{.underline}.
**[Real-world cases of cyber conflict suggest the offense is not as easy
as is often assumed and the fact that we have not seen much cyber
conflict suggest the theory is misplaced]{.underline}**. Importing the
notion of deterrence from the nuclear era is furthermore ill-judged and
makes little sense in the context of the reality of cyber weapons.

#### Contrary to realist beliefs deterrence is not effective in cyber policy

For realists, the acquisition of military capabilities is key to
deterring aggression from other states and maintaining national security
(Morgenthau 1947, 14). Deterrence aims at discouraging attacks through a
demonstration of one's military capacity and willingness to respond in
kind. [Deterrence theory rose to prominence during the Cold War because
of the threat of mutually assured destruction from nuclear weapons, and
realists figure prominently in the debate arguing that nuclear weapons
have a stabilising effect on international relations]{.underline} (Waltz
1990; Mearsheimer 1990, 19-20[). Deterrence logic now appears to be
influencing cyber policy]{.underline}. For example, in its national
cyber security strategy, the US government policy is aimed at
'convincing a potential adversary that it will suffer unacceptable costs
if it conducts an attack on the United States' (Department of Defense
2015), and the UK government, too, has spoken explicitly about the need
to respond to cyber incidents with offensive actions (Elgot 2016).
Although it may seem an attractive option because of the perceived
difficulty of defence as discussed earlier, **[there are several issues
that undermine cyber deterrence]{.underline}**. First, [a state's
ability to retaliate **is not physically demonstrable** due to the
**virtual nature** of cyber weapons and the secrecy states maintain over
them. Second**, unlike nuclear weapons, cyber weapons do not have the
same destructive capacity** and so**, to have a sufficient deterrent
effect, would have to be used repeatedly and to great
effect**.]{.underline} This is difficult, however, because each cyber
weapon is designed for a specific vulnerability which could be
subsequently patched. Third, [attributing the source of cyber incidents
can be difficult and perpetrators often deny involvement. In such cases,
therefore, a state cannot be certain of whom to respond
against]{.underline} (Libicki 2009, 39-73). These arguments suggest that
**[deterring aggression through cyber means is an unworkable policy in
practice.]{.underline}**

#### Contrary to realist theory, empirics prove that cyber conflict does not turn into cyber warfare- states avoid escalation

[For some realists, arms races increase the likelihood of
war]{.underline} (Jervis 1978, 188; Van Evera 1998, 13), yet [for
others, military build-ups are a necessary means of deterring a
revisionist power]{.underline} (Glaser 2004). [A critical question is
therefore **whether security competition will escalate to actual
conflict**.]{.underline} Previous scholarship has demonstrated a
relationship between arms races and both militarised interstate disputes
and war (Sample 1997; Gibler et al. 2005). [The concern]{.underline}
here [is whether cyber arms races will lead to a similar
outcome.]{.underline} As Lord and Sharp (2011, 29) argue: 'conflict in
cyberspace is uniquely predisposed to escalation given uncertainties
about what constitutes an act of war and the growing number of state and
non-state actors seeking offensive capabilities.' [The empirical
record]{.underline}, however, [suggests that although cyber conflict is
becoming more frequent, this increase correlates with **low level
disruption and espionage tactics** rather than more destructive forms of
cyber warfare]{.underline} (Jensen, Maness, and Valeriano 2016, 17).
Moreover, the [data shows that **cyber disputes are very unlikely to
spill over into the physical domains of warfare** suggesting that,
rather than escalation, the prevailing trend is one of
restraint]{.underline} (Valeriano and Maness 2016). [Rather than live up
to the predictions of the realist-informed spiral model, **states**
appear to **avoid escalation into warfare** and **restraint** appears to
be **the prevailing norm** instead.]{.underline} It may be too early to
tell whether escalation may become a future trend, but [thirty years of
digital conflict demonstrate a remarkable degree of self-restraint in
that states have avoided outright destruction and violence in
cyberspace.]{.underline}

### At: Realism- General

#### Realism's misreadings are rooted in the desire to strengthen power politics and are justified in the name of self-interest

Misreading in IR theory and ideology critique: Morgenthau, Waltz and
neorealism, Review of International Studies / Volume 35 / Issue 02 /
April 2009, pp 327 349

DOI: 10.1017/S0260210509008547

The results from our analysis can be summarised and further developed as
follows:¶ We recognise that Morgenthau's theory cannot be understood as
a general theory;¶ also, the assumption of international anarchy cannot
be traced back to Morgenthau.¶ Furthermore, it remains a currently open
question why both neo-realists¶ and their critics hold this association
with Morgenthau. Finally, we argue that¶ classical '[realism' has to be
understood as a historically contingent way of thinking¶ which intends
to provide answers to distinct historical circumstances]{.underline} of
world¶ politics. The time of Morgenthau was a time of ideologies and of
hubristic and¶ apocalyptic national power politics. Reacting to these
challenges creates,¶ and perpetuates, his support of power politics.
Apart from that, however,¶ Morgenthau's normative demands aim at the
creation of international law and¶ organisations as well at the
strengthening of supranational ethics. Thus, according¶ to Morgenthau
any conduct of international politics is and has to be 'realist' (only)¶
insofar as it acknowledges contingent historical circumstances and
develops¶ respective practical imperatives.¶ Morgenthau explicitly
expressed this political ambition in the editions of¶ Politics Among
Nations published after 1948. Considering the notion of ideology,¶ he
writes:¶ The nation that dispensed with ideologies and frankly stated
that it wanted power and¶ would, therefore, oppose similar aspirations
of other nations, would at once find itself at a¶ great, perhaps
decisive, disadvantage in the struggle for power. That frank admission¶
would, on the other hand, unite the other nations in fierce resistance
to a foreign policy so¶ unequivocally stated and would thereby compel
the nation pursuing it to employ more¶ power than would otherwise be
necessary.70¶ Ideology or counter-ideology is therefore necessary and
justified against the horrors¶ of totalitarianism and fascism and, in
his view, the naïve policies of appeasement.¶ This book was indeed, and
could be nothing else but, a frontal attack \[. . .\] \[Morgenthau¶
addresses here the appeasement policy towards Hitler and the idealistic
'democratic-peace'-¶ vision of Woodrow Wilson as well as the Fascist and
Stalinist ideologies; the authors\]. It¶ had to be as radical on the
side of its philosophy as had been the errors on the other side.¶ With
that battle largely won, the polemical purpose can give way to the
consolidation of a¶ position that no longer needs to be attained, but
only to be defended and adapted to new¶ experiences.71¶ But the battle
continued, and [the neo-realist production of ideologies relied upon¶
misunderstood 'realist' assumptions in order to conceptualise, promote
and¶ strengthen national power politics]{.underline}, now with new
targets and against a new enemy¶ (the Soviet Union and communism). [The
graveness and idiosyncrasy of the]{.underline} above¶ analysed
[misreadings]{.underline}, including the biased selectivity of their
readings, **[seems only¶ comprehensible as an attempt to formulate and
justify a new political ideology,¶ namely that of US foreign policy
during the Cold War]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline} effort [is
accompanied¶ by an ideologisation of political thought,]{.underline}
[which seems to have become so¶ influential]{.underline} and manifest
[in a disciplinary canon that]{.underline} -- with a few exceptions --
[even¶ the critics]{.underline} of neo-realism have not revealed these
misreadings, but instead [have¶ perpetuated them]{.underline}. This is
probably the reason why some of those misreadings have¶ found their way
in most of our up-to-date textbooks and introductions.72¶ Indeed, a
plethora of neo-realists became cooks in the 'kitchen of power'.73 [The¶
initial 'realist' idea of a temporary political counter-ideology
against]{.underline} the apocalypses¶ of [nationalism and]{.underline}
fascist and **[Stalinist ideology has developed into a¶ self-contained
ideology of 'national interest']{.underline}** which has separated the
theorems of¶ (Morgenthau's) 'realism' from its original understanding of
historical contingency.¶ [In an emerging epoch of scientism]{.underline}
[when]{.underline} political science in general and¶ [International
Relations]{.underline} in particular [have borrowed their epistemologies
from¶ positivistic natural sciences]{.underline} and economy (Waltz is
an outstanding example of this),¶ 'realist' (though falsely) and
**[neo-realist theorems have become perceived as¶ scientific laws in
order to deduce axioms for political conduct as well as strategic¶
predictions of future developments]{.underline}**. Waltz's perception of
patriotism complements¶ this observation: The rationality of the state,
which domestically acts in case of¶ doubt as an authoritarian power
state and homogenises political differences,¶ dictates to oppress
opinions, movements and individuals opposing the national¶ interest.
**[Foreign policy elites have come to define political rationality in
their¶ interest and to protect those interests as some objective raison
d'état]{.underline}**. The domestic¶ production of political homogeneity
occurs through instruments of the power¶ state, like media control. A
poignant example can be seen in the historical defence¶ of national
interests in maintaining the Cold War rationale or the run up to a¶
specific war.74 This rationality of foreign policy has little, if no,
relation with¶ democratic practice: neither in decision-making, its
legitimisation, nor in its policy¶ implementation.

[Realism has been challenged for its **inability to explain state
behaviour** or offer productive policy guidance.]{.underline} For
example, [several studies point to the **lack of evidence that states
act in accordance with balance of power logic**, a prominent hypothesis
within the realist literature]{.underline} (Rosecrance and Stein 1993,
10, 17-21; Schroeder 1994). [Its contradictory predictions and lack of
empirical progress leads]{.underline} [Vasquez]{.underline} (1997) [to
condemn realism as a 'degenerative' rather than 'progressive'
paradigm]{.underline}. Furthermore, [statistical studies suggest the
factors that realists argue **increase national security**, such as
**military build-ups and alliances**, are often **counterproductive**
and **increase the likelihood of conflict**]{.underline} (Senese and
Vasquez 2008). Nevertheless, with its focus on security and conflict
issues, realism appears to be the natural go-to theory for elucidating
pressing cyber security issues.

**Realism good is a link- It naturalizes the idea that militarism is
necessary bc it says that the way states achieve their interests is all
dominated by a will for power which rationalizes suffering**

[Given the claimed inevitability of realism\'s description of
international politics, one might think that nations need not look to
expert guidance because power interests will inevitably determine
governmental policy.]{.underline} But the realists, while embracing
determinism, simultaneously argue that human nature is repeatedly
violated. One traditional claim has been that America, because of its
unique history, has been ever in danger of ignoring the dictates of the
foreign policy scene. This argument is offered by Henry Kissinger in his
avowedly Morgenthauian work Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy. 21
Realists also argue that there are idealists in all human societies who
refuse to see the reality of power. As Richard W. Cottam, a trenchant
critic of orthodox realism, explained the argument: \"Every era has its
incorrigible idealists who persist in seeing evil man as good. When they
somehow gain power and seek to put their ideas into effect,
Machiavellians who understand man\'s true nature appear and are more
than willing and more than capable of exploiting this eternal naivete.\"
22 [Cottam was referring to one of the central ideological constructs of
international relations theory]{.underline}---[the realist/idealist
dichotomy]{.underline}. First explicated in detail by Morgenthau in his
Scientific Man vs. Power Politics, 23 [this dichotomy is used to
discredit leaders who dare to consider transcending or transforming
established patterns of global competition]{.underline}. This construct
is enriched by the narratives of failed idealists---most prominently
Tsar Alexander the First, Woodrow Wilson, Neville Chamberlain, and Jimmy
Carter---men who, despite and in fact because of their good intentions,
caused untold human suffering. After World War II, realists built their
conception of leadership on a negative caricature of Woodrow Wilson. 24
As George Kennan, one of the primary architects of Cold War policy,
warned in 1945: \"[If we insist at this moment in our history in
wandering about with our heads in the clouds of Wilsonean idealism . . .
we run the risk of losing even that bare minimum of security which would
be assured to us by the maintenance of humane, stable, and cooperative
forms of society on the immediate European shores of the
Atlantic]{.underline}.\" 25 Wilson\'s supposed idealism was said by the
emerging realist scholars to have led to the unstable international
political structure that caused World War II \[End Page 6\] and now
threatened the postwar balance of forces. Despite convincing refutations
by the leading historians of Wilson\'s presidency, most recently John
Milton Cooper Jr. in his definitive study of the League of Nations
controversy, realists continue to caricature Wilson as a fuzzy-headed
idealist. 26 Idealists, in realist writings, all share a fatal flaw: an
inability to comprehend the realities of power. They live in a world of
unreality, responding to nonexistent scenes. As Riker put it,
\"Unquestionably, there are guilt-ridden and shame-conscious men who do
not desire to win, who in fact desire to lose. These are irrational ones
in politics.\" 27 [It is here that the realist expert comes in. It is
assumed that strategic doctrine can be rationally and objectively
established. According to Kissinger, a theorist who later became a
leading practitioner, \"it is the task of strategic doctrine to
translate power into policy.\"]{.underline} The science of international
relations claims the capacity to chart the foreign policy scene and then
establish the ends and means of national policy. This objective order
can only be revealed by rational and dispassionate investigators who are
well-schooled in the constraints and possibilities of power politics.
R[ealism\'s scenic character makes it a radically empirical science. As
Morgenthau put it, the political realist \"believes in the possibility
of distinguishing in politics between truth and
opinion]{.underline}---between what is true objectively and rationally
supported by evidence and illuminated by reason, and what is only
subjective judgement.\" Avowedly modernist in orientation, realism
claims to be rooted not in a theory of how international relations ought
to work, but in a privileged reading of a necessary and predetermined
foreign policy environment. 28 [In its orthodox form political realism
assumes that international politics are and must be dominated by the
will to power. Moral aspirations in the international arena are merely
protective coloration and propaganda or the illusions that move hopeless
idealists.]{.underline} What is most revealing about this assessment of
human nature is not its negativity but its fatalism. There is little if
any place for human moral evolution or perfectibility. [Like
environmental determinism---most notably the social darwinism of the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries---political realism presumes
that human social nature, even if ethically deplorable, cannot be
significantly improved upon]{.underline}. From the stationary
perspective of social scientific realism in its pure form, the fatal
environment of human social interaction can be navigated but not
conquered. Description, in other words, is fate. All who dare to
challenge the order---Carter\'s transgression---will do much more damage
than good. The idealist makes a bad situation much worse by imagining a
better world in the face of immutable realities. As one popular saying
among foreign policy practitioners goes: \"Without vision, men die. With
it, more men die.\" 70 (continued) The implications of this social
philosophy are stark. [Tremendous human suffering can be rationalized
away as the inevitable product of the impersonal international system of
power relations.]{.underline} World leaders are actively encouraged by
the realists to put aside moral pangs of doubt and play the game of
international politics according to the established rules of political
engagement. This deliberate limitation of interest excuses leaders from
making hard moral choices. While a moralist Protestant like Jimmy Carter
sees history as a progressive moral struggle to realize abstract ideals
in the world, the realist believes that it is dangerous to struggle
against the inexorable. The moral ambiguities of political and social
ethics that have dogged philosophy and statesmanship time out of mind
are simply written out of the equation. [Since ideals cannot be valid in
a social scientific sense, they cannot be objectively true. The greatest
barrier to engaging the realists in serious dialogue about their
premises is that they deny that these questions can be seriously
debated]{.underline}. First, realists teach a moral philosophy that
denies itself. There is exceedingly narrow ground, particularly in the
technical vocabulary of the social sciences, for discussing the moral
potential of humanity or the limitations of human action. Yet, as we
have seen in the tragedy of Jimmy Carter, a philosophical perspective on
these very questions is imparted through the back door. It is very hard
to argue with prescription under the guise of description. [The
purveyors of this philosophical outlook will not admit this to
themselves, let alone to potential interlocutors. \[End Page 21\]
Second, and most importantly, alternative perspectives are not admitted
as possibilities---realism is a perspective that as a matter of first
principles denies all others.]{.underline} There is, as we have seen in
the Carter narrative, alleged to be an immutable reality that we must
accept to avoid disastrous consequences. Those who do not see this
underlying order of things are idealists or amateurs. Such people have
no standing in debate because they do not see the intractable scene that
dominates human action. Dialogue is permissible within the parameters of
the presumed order, but those who question the existence or universality
of this controlling scene are beyond debate. Third, the environmental
determinism of political realism, even though it is grounded in human
social nature, is antihumanist. Much of the democratic thought of the
last 200 years is grounded on the idea that humanity is in some sense
socially self-determining. Society as social contract is a joint project
which, over time, is subject to dialectical improvement. Foreign policy
realism, as we have seen, presupposes that there is an order to human
relations that is beyond the power of humans to mediate. 71 When you add
to this the moral imperative to be faithful to the order (the moral of
the Carter narrative), then democratic forms lose a great deal of their
value. Indeed, there has been a great deal of hand wringing in
international relations literature about how the masses are inexorably
drawn to idealists like Carter and Wilson. Morgenthau states this much
more frankly than most of his intellectual descendants: \[the\] thinking
required for the successful conduct of foreign policy can be
diametrically opposed to the rhetoric and action by which the masses and
their representatives are likely to be moved. . . . The statesman must
think in terms of the national interest, conceived as power among other
powers. [The popular mind, unaware of the fine distinctions of the
statesman\'s thinking, reasons more often than not in the simple
moralistic and legalistic terms of absolute good and absolute evil.
7]{.underline}2 [Some realists, based on this empirical observation,
openly propose that a realist foreign policy be cloaked in a moral
facade so that it will be publicly palatable. Kissinger\'s mistake, they
say, was that he was too honest]{.underline}. Morgenthau concludes that
\"the simple philosophy and techniques of the moral crusade are useful
and even indispensable for the domestic task of marshaling public
opinion behind a given policy; they are but blunt weapons in the
struggle of nations for dominance over the minds of men.\" If one
believes that social scientists have unique access to an inexorable
social reality which is beyond the control of humanity---and which it is
social suicide to ignore---it is easy to see how democratic notions of
consent and self-determination can give way to the reign of manipulative
propaganda. 73 There is another lesson that can be drawn from the
savaging of [Carter in international relations scholarship for those who
seek to broaden the terms of American foreign policy thought and
practice. Those who would challenge the realist orthodoxy \[End Page
22\] face a powerful rhetorical arsenal that will be used to deflect any
serious dialogue on the fundamental ethical and strategic assumptions of
realism.]{.underline} Careful and balanced academic critiques, although
indispensable, are unlikely to be a match for such formidable symbolic
ammunition. Post-realism, if it is to make any advance against the
realist battlements, must marshal equally powerful symbolic resources.
What is needed, in addition to academic critiques aimed at other
scholars, is a full-blooded antirealist rhetoric. It must be said, in
the strongest possible terms, that realism engenders an attitude of
cynicism and fatalism in those who would otherwise engage the great
moral and political questions of our age. 74 [History is replete with
ideals that, after much time and effort, matured into new social
realities. In the not-so-distant past, republican governance on a mass
scale and socially active government were empirical impossibilities.
However halting and imperfect these historical innovations may be, they
suggest the power of ideals and the possibility of human social
transformation]{.underline}. On the other hand, fatalism fulfills
itself. The surest way to make a situation impossible is to imagine it
so. This is a tragic irony we should strive to avoid, no matter how
aesthetically fitting it may be. Imagined dominance of realism promotes
violence and conflict- alternative images are not only possible but
critical to examine in order to avoid cognitive biases dr. A. (Annette)

**[Thayer's thesis is flawed at every stage of its
construction]{.underline}**. [It rests on the assumption that offensive
realism is an accurate depiction of international relations rather than
an ideology **without much empirical support.** The same might be said
for hegemonic stability theory,]{.underline} a justification for the
American imperial project that is empirically problematic. [Thayer
insists that these approaches to international relations are successful
because they build on correct assumptions about human
nature]{.underline}. [There is no discussion whatsoever of efforts to
reduce war and ethnic conflict through conflict resolution, institution
building, development and humanitarian intervention]{.underline}. They
are presumably in conflict with our nature and doomed to failure.
[Thayer's arbitrary choice of what is human and what is not **is offered
without any evidence**, as is his claim that war as the most important
of all human activities affecting evolution]{.underline}. **[We are
given no mechanisms that would account for the increase in brain
capacity warfare that is said to stimulate.]{.underline}** Successful
warriors are assumed to breed more successfully, another claim
unsupported by evidence. We must assume that group advantages, conferred
by individual characteristics such as aggression, bravery and loyalty,
are somehow passed on through warrior genes and that natural selection
does this rest. At the outset, Thayer claims that his approach is both
scientific and readily falsifiable. I think we must accept the latter
claim. [A final word about warfare.]{.underline} [Thayer barrages us
with evidence about its near universality]{.underline} but **[offers no
nuanced discussion of its diverse causes or roles it serves for
societies]{.underline}**. He assumes a single materialist motive: the
protection of resources or the acquisition of additional ones. [There is
no recognition of the role of honor, standing, revenge, or war as a
route of upward mobility, source of group cohesion or simply an
adventure**. Thayer weds a crude model of biology to a crude realist one
of war and international relations.**]{.underline}

### State Militarism Inevitable- Evolution

#### Dominance behavior and hierarchies are evolutionarily constant across vastly different species

Evolutionary theory can also explain dominance. Like egoism, [the desire
to dominate is a trait of human nature]{.underline} (which, as with
egoism, we stress does not necessarily apply to every individual or
situation but is a statistical tendency underlying behavior). As
evolutionary economist Robert Frank has explained, [**''Evidence
suggests that we come into the world equipped with a nervous system that
worries about rank.** Something inherent in our biological
makeup]{.underline} **[motivates us to try to improve]{.underline}**,
[or at least maintain]{.underline}, **[our standing against those with
whom we compete]{.underline}** [for important positional
resources]{.underline}.''94 In the context of evolutionary theory,
[dominance usually means that particular individuals]{.underline} in a
social group [have priority of access to resources]{.underline} [in
competitive situations]{.underline}.95 A wide variety of [animals
exhibit a form of social organization called a dominance
hierarchy]{.underline}, in which members of a social group each have a
status rank descending from the alpha male down through all the other
individuals to the lowliest subordinates[. A dominance hierarchy is
created competitively]{.underline}, [often violently, **and is
maintained forcefully**]{.underline}, [but it can]{.underline} serve to
[prevent or reduce]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} within a group
[because it establishes a pecking order that is generally
respected]{.underline}. As with all things in nature, [dominance
hierarchies vary considerably]{.underline}. Hierarchies may be weak or
strong, and ''alpha'' males may sire nearly all offspring or just more
than others. However, what is striking is the prevalence and potency of
dominance in social organization, despite variations in the specifics.
[Dominance behavior]{.underline} **[occurs in thousands of taxonomic
groups ranging from fish and reptiles to birds and
mammals.]{.underline}** Of particular note regarding the impact of
dominance on human behavior are the roles of both phylogeny (a species'
ancestral lineage) and ecology (its adaptations to local conditions).
With regard to phylogeny, [most primates and all the great
apes]{.underline} (the group to which humans belong) [have strong social
dominance hierarchies, and humans are no
exception]{.underline}---**[dominance hierarchies have been extensively
documented among humans in a wide variety of settings and
eras]{.underline}**.96,97,98 With regard to ecology, dominance
hierarchies are a common form of social organization in the kind of
ecological settings in which humans evolved (social groups with
competing interests, variation in power, and finite resources). The
strength of dominance hierarchies in humans is debated and varies
empirically, but such hierarchies are always evident in some form or
other. [Even where dominance hierarchies are actively
suppressed]{.underline}, such as in more egalitarian small-scale
societies, **[suppression itself is evidence of the competition for
status that simmers beneath the surface]{.underline}**.99 In historical
and contemporary societies, **[competition for power is all too
obvious]{.underline}**, and [the quest for status, dominance, and
leadership is ancient and ever present]{.underline}.100,101,102,103
Males of most mammal species are particularly competitive with each
other over females. Indeed, the competition for mates is subject to a
special type of evolutionary selection process---sexual selection, as
opposed to standard natural selection. Reproductive access to females
tends to be highly skewed, with a few males responsible for a large
proportion of progeny. This is because a single male can reproduce with
multiple females, whereas females can usually only reproduce and rear
the offspring of one male at a time, with a long delay before becoming
reproductively available again. In some species, reproductive access is
settled by coercion, in which the strongest male defeats rivals to
dominate a harem. In other species, males cannot coerce females, but the
females are choosy about with whom they mate, leading to selection
pressures for males to demonstrate or signal their quality as attractive
partners. In either case, it is females rather than males that are the
limiting factor in sexual competition, making male competition for
available females intense. Sexual selection has led to costly biological
adaptations, such as fighting, the growth of heavy ''weapons'' (e.g.,
antlers), risky courtship displays, or adornments that signal genetic
quality (e.g., gigantic tails). These types of adaptations not only
consume precious time and energy but can also decrease survival in
other, nonreproductive domains of life (for example, the plumage of male
peacocks limits their ability to fly). Thus, the power of sexual
selection can lead to the evolution of traits that actually damage
survival in order to achieve superiority over other males.104,105
Reproduction trumps survival in evolution. [Sexual selection is
typically responsible for the hierarchical nature of group-living animal
species]{.underline}, including humans, [as males fight for rank and the
reproductive benefits in brings]{.underline}. As we would expect, [this
leads to sex differences in the desire for status.]{.underline} Both
laboratory experiments and real-world observations have identified
empirical differences between men and women in a range of social
behaviors, not least that men tend to have relative-gains, or
''zero-sum'' motivations (wanting to get ahead at the expense of
others), whereas women tend to favor payoff-maximization, or
''variable-sum'' motivations (content to do well even if others also do
well in the process).106,107,108,109 It is well established that
[dominance and statusseeking behaviors]{.underline} [in humans are based
on many of the same biochemical and neurological processes as in other
mammals]{.underline}, **[such as the secretion and uptake of
testosterone and serotonin]{.underline}**, [which modify
status-challenging behavior]{.underline}.110,111 However rational we may
like to think we are, [our judgments and decision-making are
nevertheless influenced by cognitive mechanisms and
biochemicals]{.underline} circulating in our bodies and brains that
relate to dominance behavior.112,113,114,115 Dominance hierarchies need
not only benefit those at the top. An [organized social structure can
help promote the harvesting of resources]{.underline}, [coordinate group
activity, and reduce within-group conflict]{.underline}. Although alphas
in the hierarchy tend to have the highest reproductive success, other
[males may benefit from group membership by gaining protection from
other groups]{.underline}, or by biding their time for a chance to
challenge the alpha male when they become strong enough or old enough.
**[Ethological studies have shown that hierarchical dominance systems
within a primate group's social network can reduce overt
aggression]{.underline}**, [although aggression increases again when the
alpha male is challenged]{.underline}.116,117,118 To summarize, a
species that lives communally could have two broad forms of social
organization. [The group can accept organization with some
centralization of power]{.underline} ([dominance
hierarchies]{.underline}), [or it can engage in perpetual conflict
(''scramble competition''), which incurs costs in terms of time, energy,
and injuries, as well as depriving the group of many benefits of a
communal existence,]{.underline} such as more efficient resource
harvesting.119 Among social mammals, and primates in particular,
dominance hierarchies have emerged as the primary form of social
organization. Thus far, we have emphasized [a state of ''anarchy'' in
evolutionary history]{.underline}, **[in which there was no overarching
power to provide protection from predators]{.underline}**, rivals, or
other threats. **[Egoism and dominance arose as strategies that provided
solutions to achieving survival and reproduction in this
environment]{.underline}**. However, [dominance hierarchies were in some
sense a mechanism by which this anarchy could be
suppressed]{.underline}---at least within the group---to the benefit of
all group members since they share at least some common interests (such
as avoiding conflict). [This collective benefit points to the special
and much more significant role of anarchy at a higher
level]{.underline}---**[anarchy between groups]{.underline}**. As we
show in the next section, competition between groups is especially
significant for human evolution, and for international politics,
precisely because it is at the intergroup level where anarchy reigns
supreme and is much harder to suppress.

#### States' tendencies towards aggression and selfishness are derived from the evolutionary need to maintain dominance hierarchies

**[Evolutionary theory can also explain domination]{.underline}**. Like
egoism, [the desire to dominate is a trait]{.underline}. In the context
of evolutionary theory, **[domination usually means that particular
individuals in social groups have regular priority of access to
resources]{.underline}** in competitive situations. For most social
mammals, [a form of social organization called a dominance
hierarchy]{.underline} [operates most of the time.]{.underline} The
creation of the [dominance hierarchy may be violent and is almost always
competitive]{.underline}. A single leader, almost always male (the alpha
male), leads the group. The ubiquity of this social ordering strongly
suggests that such a [pattern of organization]{.underline} [contributes
to fitness.]{.underline} Ethologists categorize two principal types of
behavior among social mammals in a dominance hierarchy: dominant and
submissive.56 [Dominant mammals have enhanced access to mates, food, and
territory]{.underline}, **[increasing their chances of reproductive
success]{.underline}**.57 **[Acquiring dominant status usually requires
aggression]{.underline}**.58 Dominance, however, is an unstable
condition; to maintain it, [dominant individuals must be willing to
defend their privileged access]{.underline} to available resources as
long as they are able. Evolutionary anthropologist Richard Wrangham and
ethologist Dale Peterson explain why an individual animal is motivated
to vie for dominant status: \"The motivation of a male chimpanzee who
challenges another\'s rank is not that he foresees more matings or
better food or a longer life.\"59 Rather, \"those rewards explain why
\... selection has favored the desire for power, but the immediate
reason he vies for status \... is simply to dominate his peers.\"60
[Dominant animals often assume behavior reflecting their
status]{.underline}. For example, [dominant wolves and rhesus monkeys
hold their tails higher than other members of their group in an effort
to communicate dominance.]{.underline} A dominant animal that engages in
such displays is better off if it can gain priority of access to
resources without having to fight for it continuously.61 [Such signaling
behavior is found among submissive social mammals as well. They often
try to be as inconspicuous as possible]{.underline} and recognize what
is permitted and forbidden given their place in the hierarchy. **[This
behavior shows that the subordinate accepts its place in the dominance
hierarchy]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}-at least temporarily-[will
make no effort to challenge the dominant animal.]{.underline}
Ethologists argue that [dominance hierarchies evolve because they help
defend against predators, promote the harvesting of resources, and
reduce intragroup conflict]{.underline}.62 A species that lives
communally has two choices. It can either accept organization with some
centralization of power, or engage in perpetual conflict over scarce
resources, which may result in serious injury and deprive the group of
the benefits of a communal existence, such as more efficient resource
harvesting.63 Ethological studies have confirmed that a hierarchical
dominance system within a primate band minimizes overt aggression and
that group aggression often increases when the alpha male is
challenged.64 For primates and especially humans, the dominance
hierarchy may have produced a fortuitous result: great intelligence.65
As cognitive psychologist Denise Dellarosa Cummins argues, it has had a
profound effect on human evolution: \"[The fundamental components of our
reasoning architectur]{.underline}e [evolved in response to pressures to
reason about dominance hierarchies]{.underline}, the social organization
that characterizes most social mammals.\"66 Her study and others have
found that dominance hierarchies have contributed to the evolution of
the mind, which in turn has contributed to fitness. According to
Cummins, [submissive individuals can detect, exploit, and circumvent the
constraints of domination. If an animal can take what it wants by
force**, it is sure to dominate the available
resources**]{.underline}-[unless its subordinates are smart enough to
outwit]{.underline} [it]{.underline}. To survive, a subordinate must use
other strategies: deception, guile, appeasement, bartering, alliance
formation, or friendship. Thus intelligence is particularly important to
the survival of subordinates. \"[The evolution of mind
emerges]{.underline},\" Cummins writes, \"**[as a strategic arms race in
which the weaponry is ever-increasing mental capacity to represent and
manipulate internal representations of the minds of
others.]{.underline}**\"67 From their studies of chimpanzee societies,
ethologists have learned that the struggle for survival is best
characterized as a struggle between those who are dominant and those
seeking to outwit them, i.e., between recognizing an opponent\'s
intentions and hiding one\'s own. The following example illustrates how
a subordinate chimpanzee, Belle, who knows the location of hidden food,
attempts to deceive Rock, who is dominant: Belle accordingly stopped
uncovering the food if Rock was close. She sat on it until Rock left.
Rock, however, soon learned this, and when she sat in one place for more
than a few seconds, he came over, shoved her aside, searched her sitting
place, and got the food. Belle next stopped going all the way \[to the
food\]. Rock, however, countered by steadily expanding the area of his
search through the grass near where Belle had sat. Eventually, Belle sat
farther and farther away, waiting until Rock looked in the opposite
direction before she moved toward the food at all, and Rock in turn
seemed to look away until Belle started to move somewhere. On some
occasions Rock started to wander off, only to wheel around suddenly
precisely as Belle was about to uncover some food \.... On a few trials,
she actually started off a trail by leading the group in the opposite
direction from the food, and then, while Rock was engaged in his search,
she doubled back rapidly and got some food. 68 [Despite the \"arms
race\" described by Cummins to outwit dominance, the subordinate members
of the group continue to participate]{.underline} in the dominance
hierarchy **[because doing so increases the chances of
survival]{.underline}**. As ethologist David Barash explains**[, if
subordinates \"are more fit by accepting]{.underline}**\"
[subordinate]{.underline} \"[ranking than by refusing to
participate]{.underline}, **[then some form of social dominance
hierarchy will result]{.underline}**.\"69 Humans and other primates
evolved a mental architecture to address the difficulties they
encountered in dominance hierarchies. These problems, which \"directly
impact survival rates and reproductive success,\" include two crucial
needs: \"the necessity to recognize and respond appropriately to
permissions, obligations, and prohibition,\" and the necessity \"to
circumvent the constraints of hierarchy by dint of guile, particularly
through successfully forecasting others\' behavior. \"70 Because [human
mental architecture was created through evolution]{.underline}, **[it
remains part of human behavior today]{.underline}**, as cognitive
psychology studies show. 71

have focused on war as]{.underline} a major or even [the primary
mechanism of change in international relations.]{.underline} Thucydides,
in The History of the Peloponnesian War, written in the fifth century
BC, and a standard reference in textbook accounts of the realist
tradition, found that '\[t\]he growth of the power of Athens, and the
alarm which this inspired in Lacedaemon, made war inevitable'
(Thucydides 431 BC, 1.23). This position is echoed in realism up until
today. For instance, in his modern classic, aptly entitled War and
Change in World Politics, Robert Gilpin asserts that 'a precondition for
[political change lies in a disjuncture between the existing social
system and the redistribution of power towards those]{.underline} actors
[who]{.underline} would [benefit most]{.underline} from a change in the
system', [and that change]{.underline} in international relations
typically [equals war]{.underline} (Gilpin 1981, 9). Likewise, John
Mearsheimer, in The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, argues that the
most war-prone regions are those characterised by unbalanced
multipolarity with a potential hegemon seeking to change the established
order in its favour by military means, and that the growth of China
constitutes the greatest danger to world peace (Mearsheimer 2001). This
does not mean that realists are unconcerned with peace. Acting as policy
advisors or foreign policy commentators, realists have often been among
the most vocal critics of war. Hans Morgenthau and Kenneth Waltz,
arguably the two most prominent realists in the latter half of the
twentieth century, were both highly critical of US military intervention
in Vietnam (Rafshoon 2001; Humphreys 2013). More recently, 'almost all
realists in the United States -- except for Henry Kissinger -- opposed
the war against Iraq' in 2003 (Mearsheimer 2005), and [realists have
been highly critical of]{.underline} the [US military]{.underline}
[interventions]{.underline} during the Obama administration from 2009 to
2017 (Walt 2016). However, [despite this concern with peace, war remains
the primary mechanism for change in realist theory]{.underline}, and
realists have been surprisingly reluctant to explore the potential for
peaceful change.

[Political Realism sees international relations]{.underline} mainly
[as]{.underline} a struggle of [self-interested, sovereign
states]{.underline} that are [involved in a game of power-politics
within a]{.underline} permanent [state of anarchy.]{.underline} The
international system, according to this school of thought, is a moral-
and value-free environment in which the state is seen as a rational and
unitary actor that finds itself in constant conflict with the other
states of the system due to the lack of an overarching world government.
Stemming from their pessimistic view on human nature, [the only way to
achieve security]{.underline} in the international system, [according to
political realism, is by creating a Balance of Power among]{.underline}
the most [powerful states]{.underline} of the system. As briefly
mentioned earlier, both [political thinkers pick up on the realist
view]{.underline} of the international system [as a value- and
moral-free place of anarchy, where states live under]{.underline} a
constant [fear of attack or betrayal]{.underline} by others and thus are
facing a Security Dilemma. Thucydides, taking up the issue of anarchy
within the international system, very much agrees with the realist point
of view, saying that [in a system where there is no overarching
authority, the only way to maintain order is through some form of
Balance of Power]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} -- in the case of
Thucydides -- [takes the form of the strong exercising their power over
the weak.]{.underline} Hobbes, in comparison, takes quite a different
look at this. Stemming from his theory about the 'State of Nature', he
admits that without a world government, the system is subject to a state
of anarchy and of "a war as is of every man against every man"\[1\].
[However, Hobbes opposes the view that under such conditions it is the
strong who determine the order]{.underline} of the international system.
[According to his theory of the 'State of Nature', every man is equal
and thus "the weakest has strength enough to kill the
strongest]{.underline}, either by secret machination or by confederacy
with others that are in the same danger with himself."\[2\]. The order,
according to Hobbes, is rather maintained by a "general rule of
reason"\[3\] which is that "every man ought to endeavour peace"\[4\] and
since every man is equal in strength and desires, there is certainty
that this principle will be followed as long as one's own security is
not endangered. This leads on to the realist claim of a moral- and
value-free international system. He also claims that [peace and security
in an international system]{.underline} without an overarching authority
[can only be achieved through cooperation between states
and]{.underline} between [individuals]{.underline}. This leads on to the
next point which has to be made about the view of Hobbes and Thucydides
on individuals and states: cooperation. [Political realism sees no
actual possibility for states to form successful alliances]{.underline},
as no state can be trusted since it only relies on its self-interest and
does not pay much attention to what would happen to other states in the
system. Thucydides takes a similar stand as he -- although not ignoring
[the possibility -- is very sceptical]{.underline} of the chances of
success of such a form of cooperation given the anarchic structure of
the international system and solely self-interested states. Hobbes, on
the other hand, does recognise the limitations mentioned above, however
he also says that due to the fact that all states are equal within the
international system, they can "create more stable forms of coexistence
among themselves"\[8\] and thus establish peace and security.

### War = Human Nature

#### **War is inevitable and a part of human nature**

**Perry 19** (Craig Perry, emerging fellow and professional futurist,
February 24 2019, "IS ANOTHER GREAT-POWER WAR INEVITABLE?" APF,
<https://www.apf.org/blogpost/1763106/318624/Is-Another-Great-Power-War-Inevitable)-Cayden>
Mayer

[A century ago, with the world embroiled in what was then naively dubbed
the "war to end all wars,"]{.underline} few people imagined a second
global conflagration igniting just a generation later. Since the end of
World War II, however, humanity has experienced over seven decades of
relative peace, with the frequency of war deaths trending sharply
downward throughout this period. This is largely attributable to the
Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, a standoff that
spawned numerous proxy conflicts but never turned truly hot. It remains
to be seen whether the ongoing reemergence of a multipolar world, with
potentially several states capable of exerting influence on a global
scale, will lead to yet more wars among these so-called great powers.
There are good reasons to fear a return to great-power conflict.
[Warfare has been endemic to the human condition since the dawn of
civilization, and remains the ultimate way of resolving conflicts among
states even in the modern era. World affairs are inherently anarchic,
with states pursuing their own advantages in a Hobbesian struggle of
each against all.]{.underline} While the weak may occasionally band
together to balance would-be hegemons, the prevailing self-help system
of international relations features no permanent friends or enemies,
just interests. "[Countries have always competed for wealth and
security, and the competition has often led to conflict]{.underline},"
the late neo-realist scholar Kenneth Waltz noted. "[Why should the
future be different from the past?"]{.underline} Indeed, war has
accompanied the rise and fall of great powers throughout recorded
history. In his classic account of the Peloponnesian War, Greek
historian Thucydides concluded that the growth of Athenian power and the
fear this inspired in then-dominant Sparta made war between these
city-states inevitable. This dynamic, which political scientist Graham
Allison calls the "Thucydides Trap," has ensnared rising and established
powers in more than a dozen wars over the last 500 years---and it
threatens to do so again as other states challenge the United States for
global influence. Such systemic, structural factors are not the only
aspects of international relations that can drive states towards armed
conflict. Marxists argue that capitalism compels the core,
industrialized powers to compete for dominance as they exploit
peripheral countries for labor and raw materials. Political scientist
Samuel Huntington suggested it is culture---rather than ideology,
politics, or economics---that is shaping patterns of conflict, with the
Western belief in the universality of its values leading to clashes with
rival civilizations. Constructivists similarly believe ideas shape
international relations, as each state perceives world events in its own
peculiar way. [So why should the future be different from the past? With
nearly 200 sovereign states around the globe, it seems inevitable that
at least some of them will come into conflict in the coming
decades]{.underline}---and great powers will occasionally intervene if
only to enforce international law or for some other ostensibly noble
purpose. Yet it is far from certain that these great powers will again
come to blows with each other, for several reasons. While anarchy will
continue to characterize international relations for the foreseeable
future, a number of developments---including nuclear deterrence,
globalization of trade and investment, relevant international
institutions, shifting social norms, and widespread competition below
the threshold of war---are incrementally reducing the likelihood of
another great-power conflict. Will these trends be enough to prevent the
eventual outbreak of World War III?

#### Aggression is [biological]{.underline} --- psychological adaptations determine reactions to conflict

\*\*we do not endorse gendered language

A number of [biosocial
[criminologists](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/criminologist)]{.underline}
have attempted to [illuminate aggression]{.underline} (as well as crime
and
[delinquency](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/social-sciences/delinquency)
more generally) [in terms of its
[heritability](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/heritability)]{.underline}.
Here, my aim will be twofold: First, to bridge behavior genetics with
the [explanatory
model](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/psychology/explanatory-model)
developed in this paper, and then to briefly discuss the evolutionary
processes that can act to generate heritable variation in traits
connected to male aggression. [Heritable variation in violent crime has
been established by behavior geneticists]{.underline} (e.g., [Barnes et
al.,
2014](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0050);

On the one hand, these studies show us how much of the variance in a
given population, at a given time, can be explained by heritable
factors. Yet on the other hand, heritability studies are largely silent
on the mechanistic and developmental details that subserve the
heritability of traits. In order to see how these two sides of the coin
are interrelated, we can start by considering the concept of reactive
heritability, which sketches how heritable traits express or magnify
themselves developmentally (e.g., [Tooby & Cosmides,
1990](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0680);

2015](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0585)).
[To illustrate how]{.underline} such [processes]{.underline} can [work,
we can consider an example germane to **aggression**, whereby an
individual inherits above **average physical strength**.]{.underline}
From the figurative point-of-view of the underlying psychological
adaptations that govern aggression (broadly speaking), and all else
equal, it is unknown what the level of physical strength is in the
organism that the adaptations are developing and operating in. However,
it is possible that [natural-selection can design]{.underline} such
[adaptations so that they can assess what the agent\'s physical strength
level is]{.underline}---perhaps, for instance, [by attending to feedback
regarding how often, and to what degree, the agent is either successful
or unsuccessful in physical [conflicts of
interest](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/social-sciences/conflict-of-interest)]{.underline}
with other agents. Given these assessments, [the underlying
psychological adaptation can then compute an overall index of the
agent\'s physical strength, and then utilize that index when judging if
and when to instrumentally mete out aggression]{.underline}. Whether
such an adaptation has actually evolved, and, if so, what its design
features are, are of course empirical questions. However,
[**evolutionary psychologists** have]{.underline} indeed [found
experimental evidence that suggests that a psychological adaptation has
evolved in men that can assess one\'s physical strength, and then use
that assessment as an "internal regulatory variable" which
governs]{.underline}, for instance, [one\'s **proneness to use anger**
as a bargaining tactic during conflicts]{.underline} of interest with
other agents ([Sell, Cosmides, et al.,
2009](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S1359178918301666#bb0620);

#### War throughout history has always been caused by human nature and greed

\*Modified for gendered language- Cayden Mayer

It is too great a task to identify a common cause of all wars, past and
present, then attribute it responsibility for their commencing. However,
what can be done is to identify certain foundations common in all "war",
and pay heed to how "states \[or other structures\] actually behave,
behind the façade of their values-based rhetoric" (Kaplan, 2012, p.1).
It will be this essay's goal to determine first, what needs be included
in the definition of "human nature", and what constitutes "war", and
second, stake the claim that all political action, including that of
states, is derived primarily from this definition of human nature. The
first task is to define what is meant by "war", and while definitions
abound, it is possible to order them into one of two categories supplied
by the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. The first is the modern
conventional view, that [war is "the state of armed conflict between
nations or state]{.underline}s" (Oxford, 2007, p.3573),
[and]{.underline} the second, considerably broader, of "[any active
hostility or struggle between living beings]{.underline}" (Oxford, 2007,
p.3573). The former accounts well for conflicts that were overwhelmingly
state-centric, such as the First World War, and marks a clear
distinction between war and individual political violence: war is the
business of states. However, is the Vietnam War to be understood---like
the Korean---as a simple north versus south conflict, despite the
northern state only assuming active involvement nine years after
indigenous fighting broke out in 1955? (Young, 1991, p. 123) The second
category, while accounting correctly for the National Liberation Front
in Vietnam, is in need of qualification, or else runs the unhelpful risk
of equating all acts with warfare. While a simple merging of the two
definitions would not suffice, there are some similarities to be
observed. Both imply in the Clausewitzian sense that war is a tool used
to achieve ends: "a continuation of politics by other means"
(Clausewitz, 1989, p. 606). A state acts in its national interest, just
as Islamist group Ansar al-Dine acts in its---and its
people's---religio-political interests in Mali (Welsh, 2013). The latter
definition will be qualified by the observation that all actors engaged
in war, be they NLF in Vietnam, or Ansar al-Dine in Mali, do so in
hierarchical groups. ["War"]{.underline} in this [essay will be
characterised by its employment by united, hierarchical structures, as a
tool to achieve politics ends]{.underline}. While it is accepted that
wars have an almost infinite number of unique causes, the pursuit of a
primary explanation has a long tradition. From Christian teachings arose
what [Neorealist]{.underline}, Kenneth Waltz, [refers to as the
"pessimistic" view of human nature, its advocates attesting to a fixed
and flawed humanity]{.underline}, man's\[1\] inherent evil (Waltz, 2001,
p. 26). Among them is Sir Norman Angell who in 1925 wrote of man, the
"fighting animal, emotional, passionate, illogical..." (Angell, p. 7).
It is their view [that while rationality is pursued, it is---and will
forever be---blighted by the underlying imperfections of humanity, among
them, the propensity to war.]{.underline} The pessimist view endures, as
do the principles established in 17th century philosopher, Thomas
Hobbes's Leviathan. That [(hu)man will essentially pursue his own
interests and this]{.underline}, in the absence of a higher power, will
lead to conflict (Hobbes, 2008, pp. xxviii-xxx). In this state of
anarchy (of no higher authority), of "war with every other man",
[societies are apparently "few, fierce, short-lived, poor, nasty, and
destroyed of all that pleasure]{.underline}, and beauty of life, which
peace and society are wont to bring with them" (Hobbes, 2008, p. xxxi).
[Examples of such existences abound from the failed states of Somalia
and the Democratic Republic of Congo]{.underline}, and it is for this
reason that man yields his freedoms to authority, the only guarantor of
peace. The philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, too observed that: "one
man cannot begin to behave decently unless he has some assurance that
others will not be able to ruin him" (Waltz, 2001, pp. 6-7); the state
provides these assurances; this is why man assembles into states or
other structures. The state assumes the role of provider, acting too as
arbitrator within its territory while its constituents obey. But what of
a world in which multiple states emerge? Waltz writes that "Among men as
among states, anarchy, or the absence of government, is \[again\]
associated with the occurrence of violence" (emphasis mine) (Waltz,
1986, p. 98). However, that is not to say these societies are "few, and
fierce", least of all "short-lived" as Hobbes predicted. Many states
have long histories, and those that fail are clearly exceptions to the
rule. What is really at fault here is the pessimist view that human
nature is irrationally inclined to violence. As Waltz notes in his
critique, "a static human nature cannot explain the differences in
political outcomes. For example, one cannot explain both war and peace
by arguing that man is wicked" (Griffiths, 1995, p. 66). Clearly there
is another variable, without which human nature cannot suffice as the
primary cause of war. This additional variable becomes apparent in
further reading of Leviathan, specifically concerning the environment
mankind inhabits. Hobbes writes of the state of nature, "[If any two
(hu)mans desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both
enjoy, they become enemies; and in the way to their end \[...\]
endeavour to destroy, or subdue one another]{.underline}" (Hobbes, 2008,
p. 83). [While it might seem this competition for resources is an
alternative to the human nature claim to war, as will be seen, it is
only by the combination of this factor and another of human nature, that
war can be given any primary cause]{.underline}. It must be argued that
the base requirements for mankind's survival are of such significance to
human nature that the competition for these be included in its very
definition. [Survival, dependent first and foremost on the securing of
these resources, and secondly on their protection, is integral to the
causation of wars.]{.underline} However, there remains another question:
[why when two actors desire the same thing, does co-operation not play a
greater role? The answer is again found deeply embedded in one of the
facets of (hu)man]{.underline}. As Hobbes observed, there is a great
distrust among men. [That a (hu)man need fear those "prepared with
forces united to dispossess and deprive them, not only of the fruit of
their labour, but also of their life or liberty]{.underline}", is cause
for him to "master the persons of all men he can so long till he see no
other power great enough to endanger him" (Hobbes, 2008, p. 57). In
Realist terms, this is known as the "security dilemma" (Waltz, 2001, p.
37), and is sourced from the knowledge that one can never know the true
intentions of another, and so can rely only on oneself. [The same is
true for states, which are again proven to be "(hu)man writ
large"]{.underline} in the words of Morgenthau (Griffiths, 1995, p. 66).
John Mearsheimer refers to this as the "uncertainty of intentions", and
as a facet of human nature it has had disastrous consequences, most
prominently in the beginning of the First World War. There had been an
arms race in 1912 and 1913 all throughout Europe (Mulligan, 2010, p.
209) and when combined with high diplomatic tensions, and the scramble
by Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia and France to mobilise (Martel,
2003, pp. 2-3), a situation arose in which, states were unsure that
"other states \[did\] not have offensive intentions to go along with
their offensive capabilities" (Mearsheimer, 2003, p. 31). The likelihood
of war here as a direct result of limitations imposed by human nature
was irreversibly heightened, and the significance of this insurmountable
fear---only dampened by defence spending---this limitation generates was
exposed. Mearsheimer's analysis, going further than the traditional
Realist's, concludes similarly to Hobbes', that the only way to maintain
security is to muster a power so great that no other can contest your
strength. Writing on German eagerness for war in 1914, he claims it was
"not a case of wacky strategic ideas pushing a state to start a war it
was sure to lose" but "a calculated risk, motivated in large part by
Germany's desire to \[...\] become Europe's hegemon" (Mearsheimer, 2003,
p. 214). Here it can be seen that no matter how complex a state's
policy, its own ability to procure and defend resources---defined in
terms of power---is always the primary aim. As Morgenthau writes on
power "whatever the ultimate aims of international politics, power is
always the immediate aim" (Morgenthau, 2006, p. 29). Now that [a
culpable human nature has been established]{.underline}, it is now time
to see where it stands among other theories of the causes of war.

#### **War is biologically engrained in human nature**

"[History is a bath of blood]{.underline}," wrote William James, whose
1906 antiwar essay is arguably the best ever written on the subject.
"Modern man inherits all the innate pugnacity and all the love of glory
of his ancestors. Showing war's irrationality and horror is of no effect
on him. The horrors make the fascination. War is the strong life; it is
life in extremis; war taxes are the only ones men never hesitate to pay,
as the budgets of all nations show us." [Our bloody nature, it can now
be argued in the context of modern biology, is ingrained because
group-versus-group competition was a principal driving force that made
us what we are.]{.underline} In prehistory, group selection (that is,
the competition between tribes instead of between individuals) lifted
the hominids that became territorial carnivores to heights of
solidarity, to genius, to enterprise---and to fear[. Each tribe knew
with justification that if it was not armed and ready, its very
existence was imperiled]{.underline}. Throughout history, the escalation
of a large part of technology has had combat as its central purpose.
Today the calendars of nations are punctuated by holidays to celebrate
wars won and to perform memorial services for those who died waging
them. Public support is best fired up by appeal to the emotions of
deadly combat, over which the amygdala---a center for primary emotion in
the brain---is grandmaster. [We find ourselves in the "battle" to stem
an oil spill, the "fight" to tame inflation, the "war" against cancer.
Wherever there is an enemy, animate or inanimate, there must be a
victory]{.underline}. You must prevail at the front, no matter how high
the cost at home. Any excuse for a real war will do, so long as it is
seen as necessary to protect the tribe. The remembrance of past horrors
has no effect. From April to June in 1994, killers from the Hutu
majority in Rwanda set out to exterminate the Tutsi minority, which at
that time ruled the country. In a hundred days of unrestrained slaughter
by knife and gun, 800,000 people died, mostly Tutsi. The total Rwandan
population was reduced by 10 percent. When a halt was finally called, 2
million Hutu fled the country, fearing retribution. The immediate causes
for the bloodbath were political and social grievances, but they all
stemmed from one root cause: Rwanda was the most overcrowded country in
Africa. For a relentlessly growing population, the per capita arable
land was shrinking toward its limit. The deadly argument was over which
tribe would own and control the whole of it. Universal conflict  Once a
group has been split off from other groups and sufficiently dehumanized,
any brutality can be justified, at any level, and at any size of the
victimized group up to and including race and nation. And so it has ever
been. A familiar fable is told to symbolize this pitiless dark angel of
human nature. A scorpion asks a frog to ferry it across a stream. The
frog at first refuses, saying that it fears the scorpion will sting it.
The scorpion assures the frog it will do no such thing. After all, it
says, we will both perish if I sting you. The frog consents, and halfway
across the stream the scorpion stings it. Why did you do that, the frog
asks as they both sink beneath the surface. It is my nature, the
scorpion explains. [War, often accompanied by genocide, is not a
cultural artifact of just a few societies]{.underline}. Nor has it been
an aberration of history, a result of the growing pains of our species'
maturation. [Wars and genocide have been universal and eternal,
respecting no particular time or culture. Archaeological]{.underline}
sites are strewn with the evidence of mass conflicts and burials of
massacred people. Tools from the earliest Neolithic period, about 10,000
years ago, include instruments clearly designed for fighting. One might
think that the influence of pacific Eastern religions, especially
Buddhism, has been consistent in opposing violence. Such is not the
case. Whenever Buddhism dominated and became the official ideology, war
was tolerated and even pressed as part of faith-based state policy. The
rationale is simple, and has its mirror image in Christianity: Peace,
nonviolence, and brotherly love are core values, but a threat to
Buddhist law and civilization is an evil that must be defeated. Since
the end of World War II, violent conflict between states has declined
drastically, owing in part to the nuclear standoff of the major powers
(two scorpions in a bottle writ large). But civil wars, insurgencies,
and state-sponsored terrorism continue unabated. Overall, big wars have
been replaced around the world by small wars of the kind and magnitude
more typical of hunter-gatherer and primitively agricultural societies[.
Civilized societies have tried to eliminate torture, execution, and the
murder of civilians, but those fighting little wars do not
comply.]{.underline} Archaeologists have determined that after
populations of Homo sapiens began to spread out of Africa approximately
60,000 years ago, the first wave reached as far as New Guinea and
Australia. The descendants of the pioneers remained as hunter-gatherers
or at most primitive agriculturalists, until reached by Europeans.
Living populations of similar early provenance and archaic cultures are
the aboriginals of Little Andaman Island off the east coast of India,
the Mbuti Pygmies of Central Africa, and the !Kung Bushmen of southern
Africa. All today, or at least within historical memory, have exhibited
aggressive territorial behavior.

[www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/owen-jones-protest-without-politics-will-change-nothing-2373612.html](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/owen-jones-protest-without-politics-will-change-nothing-2373612.html)\]

My first experience of police kettling was aged 16. It was May Day 2001,
and the anti-globalisation movement was at its peak. The
turn-of-the-century anti-capitalist movement feels largely forgotten
today, but it was a big deal at the time. To a left-wing teenager
growing up in an age of unchallenged neo-liberal triumphalism, just to
have \"anti-capitalism\" flash up in the headlines was thrilling.
Thousands of apparently unstoppable protesters chased the world\'s
rulers from IMF to World Bank summits -- from Seattle to Prague to Genoa
-- and the authorities were rattled.¶ [Today, as protesters in nearly a
thousand cities across the world follow the example set by]{.underline}
the [Occupy]{.underline} Wall Street protests, [it\'s worth pondering
what happened to the anti-globalisation movement]{.underline}. Its
[activists did not lack passion or determination. But they did **lack a
coherent alternative** to the neo-liberal project.]{.underline} [With no
clear political direction, **the movement was easily swept away**
by]{.underline} the [jingoism and turmoil that followed
9/11,]{.underline} just two months after Genoa.¶ Don\'t get me wrong:
the Occupy movement is a glimmer of sanity amid today\'s economic
madness. By descending on the West\'s financial epicentres, it reminds
us of how a crisis caused by the banks (a sentence that needs to be
repeated until it becomes a cliché) has been cynically transformed into
a crisis of public spending. The founding statement of Occupy London
puts it succinctly: \"We refuse to pay for the banks\' crisis.\" The
Occupiers direct their fire at the top 1 per cent, and rightly so -- as
US billionaire Warren Buffett confessed: \"There\'s class warfare, all
right, but it\'s my class, the rich class, that\'s making war, and
we\'re winning.\"¶ The Occupy movement has provoked fury from senior US
Republicans such as Presidential contender Herman Cain who --
predictably -- labelled it \"anti-American\". They\'re right to be
worried: those camping outside banks threaten to refocus attention on
the real villains, and to act as a catalyst for wider dissent. [But a
coherent alternative to the tottering global economic order remains, it
seems, **as distant as ever**]{.underline}. [¶ Neo-liberalism crashes
around, half-dead, with no-one to administer the killer
blow.¶]{.underline} There\'s always a presumption that a crisis of
capitalism is good news for the left. Yet in the Great Depression,
fascism consumed much of Europe. The economic crisis of the 1970s did
lead to a resurgence of radicalism on both left and right. But,
spearheaded by Thatcherism and Reaganism, the New Right definitively
crushed its opposition in the 1980s.[This time round, there **doesn\'t
even seem to be an alternative for the right to defeat.**]{.underline}
That\'s not the fault of the protesters. In truth, [the left has never
recovered from being virtually **smothered out of
existence**]{.underline}. [It was the victim of a perfect storm: the
rise of the New Right; neo-liberal globalisation; and the]{.underline}
repeated [defeats suffered by the trade union movement.]{.underline}¶
But, above all, it was the aftermath of the collapse of Communism that
did for the left[. As US neo-conservative]{.underline} Midge [Decter
triumphantly put it: \"It\'s time to say: We\'ve won.
Goodbye]{.underline}.\" From the British Labour Party to the African
National Congress, left-wing movements across the world hurtled to the
right in an almost synchronised fashion. [It was as though the left wing
of the global political spectrum had been sliced off. That\'s
why]{.underline}, **[although we live in an age of revolt, there remains
no left to give it direction and purpose.]{.underline}**

### Policy Focus Good

#### The plan's [policy-relevant]{.underline} and [consequentialist]{.underline} framing is [more effective]{.underline}

Matthew **Bolton 16**, assistant professor of political science at Pace
University; and Elizabeth Minor, researcher at UK‐based NGO Article 36,
September 2016, "The Discursive Turn Arrives in Turtle Bay: The
International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons' Operationalization of
Critical IR Theories," Global Policy, Vol. 7, No. 3, p. 385-395

Within the IR literature [there is a perennial admonition to **make
theory more 'relevant' to policy makers**]{.underline}, but this is
usually cast in problem‐solving terms: producing knowledge that solves
the problems faced by the existing political framework. (Lepgold, 1998;
Eriksson and Sundelius, 2005; Walt, 2005). Many of [those engaged in
critical theorizing resist]{.underline} such [demands to be 'useful,'
suspicious of]{.underline} the operationalization of [academic work in
oppressive systems]{.underline}, and tend towards a position of
'resistance' to the system as a whole. Critical security studies scholar
Anna Stavrianakis (2012, p. 233) for example, calls on disarmament
activists to demand 'transgressive change that fundamentally alters the
social landscape as well as generates concrete improvements' rather than
calling for 'incremental changes that leave the parameters of an issue
untouched'. Given the centrality of discourse to critical theorizing,
[resistance is often framed **not in terms of**]{.underline} taking
territory, mobilizing bodies, **[changing legislation]{.underline}**,
gaining votes or raising money. Rather [it tends to focus on
the]{.underline} critical [deconstruction of oppressive discourse and
disruption of existing norms]{.underline} (e.g. Hargreaves, 2012). As a
result, many [critical IR scholars see their academic work]{.underline}
-- undermining dominant discourses through [their
scholarship]{.underline} and teaching -- [as their primary form of
resistance]{.underline}. (Said, 1996).¶ An emerging generation of
political actors were educated by post‐positivist and critical IR
scholars and conceive of their work self‐consciously in discursive
terms. That is, they frame their intervention in the political arena as
a deliberate attempt to reshape the way society speaks about and gives
meaning to a particular phenomenon, people, group or activity. Occupy
Wall Street activists drew upon critical and discursive theories to
strategize their symbolic disruption of the neo‐liberal order (Welty,
2013). LGBTQA activists and 'third wave' feminists are trying to change
dominant discourses of gender and sexuality (e.g. St. Pierre, 2000).
However, [critical theory has had **less impact** on]{.underline} the
realm of [international military and security policy, which remains
heavily influenced by realist thought]{.underline} (Cooper, 2006).¶ As
critical theorizing has begun to be used for solving definable political
problems (e.g. Davies, 2012; Merlingen, 2013), what Brown (2013) calls
'[critical problem‐solving theory']{.underline}, it [has
eroded]{.underline} Cox\'s (1981) [boundary between 'problem‐solving'
and critical theories]{.underline}. What happens when a theoretical
paradigm that explicitly defines itself in critical opposition is
instrumentalized and used in problem‐solving ways? This question, which
we begin to explore in this article, is underexamined in the literature
(see Weizman, 2012, pp. 185--220 for an important exception).¶ According
to the epistemic community literature (e.g. Haas 2004), the [education
of policy makers can shape their later actions]{.underline} (Eriksson
and Sundelius, 2005). Most usefully for this article, it shows how [at
critical junctures policy makers will turn to experts. Policy makers
tend to be less interested in meta‐theory or broad academic
debates]{.underline} about an issue. Rather, [they look for knowledge
that can be **used instrumentally to solve a particular policy
problem**]{.underline} (e.g. Hall, 1993). [But moving theoretical ideas
from academia, through the activist community, to the policy arena,
dilutes the original ideas and reinterprets them in instrumental
ways]{.underline}. To help understand this, we draw on postcolonial
concepts of 'translation' and 'creolization' of different 'knowledge
systems' pushed into contact (Shih and Lionet, 2011, p. 30). We find
that some ICAN [campaigners]{.underline} responsible for its current
strategy [have 'translated' IR discursive theory into the world of
disarmament policy making]{.underline}. In doing so, [they selected the
aspects of critical security studies 'to transpose and
emphasize']{.underline} (cf. Tymoczko, 2000 p. 24) [as befit their
specific political goals. This creative application of critical theory
in a new setting]{.underline}, in its translation of theory into
political engagement, [may necessarily involve rendering it **less
threatening to elite audiences**, in the process of **seeking policy
changes**]{.underline} (cf. Jeffrey, 2013, pp. 107--131).

#### Policymakers must take national interest above all other interests\-\--it's the only ethical option

William F. **Felice 2008**, Professor of international political
economy, international law, international organization, and human rights
at New York University, "Moral Responsibility in a Time of War", Social
Justice/Global Options, https://www.jstor.org/stable/29768499

Ethics, also known as moral philosophy, attempts to distinguish between
right and wrong behavior[. Ethical theories have been applied to war and
violence with \"just war\" theories influencing
policymakers]{.underline}. However, [the **intellectual framework used
by** the overwhelming majority of the world\'s **foreign policy
decision-makers is** an \"amoral\" calculation of **what action best
serves the \"national interest**]{.underline}.\" [The first-rate foreign
policy expert will give absolute priority to the interests of his or her
nation, which often means neglecting and opposing the material interests
of those outside this partial community. Through this lens, **policy
options pose few moral dilemmas**, as these decisions are merely
practical solutions to real-world problems]{.underline}. Some who call
themselves \"[political realists\" share such a view of the separation
of ethics from politics. ¶]{.underline} To a classical political
realist, history demonstrates that states must focus on power and wealth
to survive in the international system. Morality has a limited role to
play in this anarchical, dangerous world. Since the time of Thucydides
in ancient Greece, states have consistently chosen power over negotiated
diplomatic agreements, with the \"logic of fear and escalation\" always
pushing out the \"logic of moderation and peaceful diplomacy.\" This
overriding priority of \"national security\" means that ethics plays an
extremely circumscribed role in the deliberations of states. Many
realists argue that in international politics \"only the weak resort to¶
moral argument\" (Smith, 1986: 6-7). ¶ [Many powerful officials in the
U.S. government have stated strongly that, in their view, moral
considerations have no place in politics.]{.underline} For example, Dean
Acheson, former secretary of state under President Harry Truman, was
asked by President Kennedy in 1962 to serve on the Executive Committee
to advise the president on an appropriate response to the Cuban missile
crisis. Acheson later wrote that during these discussions, when the
lives of millions of people were in danger, \"those involved\...will
remember the irrelevance of the supposed moral considerations brought
out in the discussions\...moral talk did not bear on the problem\"
(Acheson, 1971; Coady, 1993: 373). [Realist counsel has traditionally
excluded morality from foreign policy]{.underline} and instead focused
solely on the \"national interest.\" Yet, this does not mean that no
ethics apply to statecraft. Rather, a difference is accepted in the
morals that apply to individuals versus those that apply to the state.
An individual can base his or her conduct on principles such as honesty
and nonviolence. In contrast, the state must protect its position of
\"power\" in the international system. This means that the state should
not engage in ideological crusades for democracy and freedom that could
dilute its power. Yet key \"realist\" virtues enhance the state\'s power
position and thus must be embraced. These ethical norms are said to
include prudence, humility, study, responsibility, and patriotism. Such
an approach allows leaders to conduct a responsible and tough defense of
the national interest, but still show respect for others. The claim made
for the cosmopolitan significance of this realist approach has been
named \"ethical realism.\" \"Ethical realism,\" according to Lieven and
Hulsman (2006: 62-83), \"is therefore of universal and eternal value for
the conduct of international affairs, and especially useful as a guiding
philosophy for the United States and its war on terror.\"¶ As a
representative of the community overall, [**the government official has
a primary obligation to the national interest**, and, in particular, the
security and integrity of the state]{.underline}. The ethics of
\"humility\" and \"prudence\" can help to protect the security of the
state. However, [the necessities of national existence cannot be sorted
out through an ethical lens of right and wrong conduct]{.underline}.
Effective statecraft demands that officials act to protect the whole,
even if individual and collective moral principles are sacrificed.
**[The government official must protect the interests of the community
above all else.]{.underline}** As [a result, according to international
relations theorist Hans Morgenthau (1979: 13), there is a \"difference
in the moral principles that apply to the private citizen in his
relations with other private citizens and to the public figure in
dealing with other public figures.]{.underline}\" Many of these
\"political realists\" and/or \"ethical realists\" seem to embrace
Machiavelli's division of morality between the public and private
worlds.

## Turns

### Militarism Good Turn

#### Militarism is good- military deterrence and the willingness to use force will save more lives

Victor Davis **Hanson 04,** Professor of Classical Studies at CSU
Fresno, "The Fruits of Appeasement", City Journal, Spring 2004,
http://www.cityjournal.org/html/14_2_the_fruits.html

[The twentieth century should have taught the citizens of liberal
democracies the catastrophic consequences of placating
tyrants]{.underline}. British and French [restraint over
the]{.underline} occupation of the Rhineland, the
[Anschluss]{.underline}, the absorption of the Czech Sudetenland, and
the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia [did not win gratitude but
rather Hitler's contempt for their weakness. Fifty million dead, the
Holocaust]{.underline}, [and the near destruction of European
civilization were the wages of "appeasement"]{.underline}---a term that
early-1930s liberals proudly embraced as far more enlightened than the
old idea of "deterrence" and "military readiness."

[So too did Western excuses for the Russians' violation of guarantees of
free elections in postwar Eastern Europe]{.underline}, China, and
Southeast Asia [only embolden the Soviet Union]{.underline}. [What
eventually contained Stalinism was the Truman Doctrine, NATO, and
nuclear deterrence---not the United Nations---and what destroyed its
legacy was Ronald Reagan's assertiveness, not Jimmy Carter's
accommodation or Richard Nixon's détente]{.underline}.

As long ago as the fourth century b.c., Demosthenes warned how
complacency and self-delusion among an affluent and free Athenian people
allowed a Macedonian thug like Philip II to end some four centuries of
Greek liberty---and in a mere 20 years of creeping aggrandizement down
the Greek peninsula. Thereafter, [these historical lessons should have
been clear to citizens of any liberal society: we must neither presume
that comfort and security are our birthrights and are guaranteed without
constant sacrifice and vigilance, nor expect that peoples outside the
purview of bourgeois liberalism share our commitment to reason,
tolerance, and enlightened self-interest.]{.underline}

[Most important, military deterrence and the willingness to use force
against evil in its infancy usually end up, in the terrible arithmetic
of war, saving more lives than they cost]{.underline}. All this can be a
hard lesson to relearn each generation, especially now that we contend
with the sirens of the mall, Oprah, and latte. Our affluence and leisure
are as antithetical to the use of force as rural life and relative
poverty once were catalysts for muscular action. [The age-old lure of
appeasement---perhaps they will cease with this latest concession,
perhaps we provoked our enemies, perhaps demonstrations of our future
good intentions will win their approval---was never more evident than in
the recent Spanish elections, when an affluent European electorate,
reeling from the horrific terrorist attack of 3/11, swept from power the
pro-U.S. center-right government on the grounds that the mass murders
were more the fault of the United States]{.underline} for dragging Spain
into the effort to remove fascists and implant democracy in Iraq
[than]{.underline} of the primordial [al-Qaidist culprits]{.underline},
who long ago promised the Western and Christian Iberians ruin for the
Crusades and the Reconquista.

#### Militarism is key to leadership and preserving order to check those who threaten the world order

David **Brooks 01**, a Canadian-born American political and cultural
commentator who writes for The New York Times, "Age of conflict,"
November 5, 2001,
https://www.weeklystandard.com/david-brooks/the-age-of-conflict

Obviously nobody knows what the future years will feel like, but we do
know that the next decade will have a central feature that was lacking
in the last one: The next few years will be defined by conflict. And
it\'s possible to speculate about what that means. [**The institutions
that fight for us and defend us against disorder \-- the military, the
FBI, the CIA \-- will seem more important and more admirable. The
fundamental arguments won\'t be over economic or social issues, they
will be over how to wield power \-- whether to use American power
aggressively or circumspectly. We will care a lot more about ends \--
winning the war \-- than we will about means.**]{.underline} We will
debate whether it is necessary to torture prisoners who have information
about future biological attacks. We will destroy innocent villages by
accident, shrug our shoulders, and continue fighting. In an age of
conflict, bourgeois virtues like compassion, tolerance, and
industriousness are valued less than the classical virtues of courage,
steadfastness, and a ruthless desire for victory. \[...continues...\]
But now violence has come calling. Now it is no longer possible to live
so comfortably in one\'s own private paradise. [Shocked out of the
illusion of self-reliance, most of us realize that we, as individuals,
simply cannot protect ourselves. **Private life requires public
protection.** Now it is not possible to ignore foreign affairs, because
foreign affairs have not ignored us. It has become clear that we are
living in a world in which **hundreds of millions of people hate us**,
and some small percentage of them **want to destroy us**]{.underline}.
That realization is bound to have cultural effects. In the first place,
we will probably become more conscious of our American-ness. During the
blitz in 1940, George Orwell sat in his bomb shelter and wrote an essay
called \"England Your England.\" It opened with this sentence: \"As I
write, highly civilised human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill
me.\" What struck him at that moment of danger was that it really does
matter whether you are English or German. The nation is a nursemaid that
breeds certain values and a certain ethos. Orwell went on to describe
what it meant to be English. Now Americans are being killed simply
because they are Americans. Like Orwell, Americans are once again
becoming aware of themselves as a nationality, not just as members of
some ethnic community or globalized Internet chat group. Americans have
been reminded that, despite what the multiculturalists have been
preaching, [not all cultures are wonderfully equal hues in the great
rainbow of humanity. Some national cultures, the ones that have
inherited certain ideas \-- about freedom and democracy, the limits of
the political claims of religion, the importance of tolerance and
dissent \-- are **more humane** than other civilizations, which reject
those ideas]{.underline}. As criticism of our war effort grows in
Europe, in hostile Arab countries, and in two-faced countries like Egypt
and Saudi Arabia, which dislike our principles but love our dollars,
Americans will have to articulate a defense of our national principles
and practices. That debate in itself will shape American culture. We
will begin to see ourselves against the backdrop of the Taliban. During
the Cold War, we saw ourselves in contrast to the Soviet Union. Back
then, we faced a godless foe; now we are facing a god-crazed foe. As we
recoil from the Islamic extremists, we may be less willing to integrate
religion into political life. That would mean trouble for faith-based
initiatives and religion in the public square. On the other hand,
democracies tend to become patriotic during wartime, if history is any
guide, and this will drive an even deeper wedge between regular
Americans and the intellectual class. Literary critic Paul Fussell, a
great student of American culture in times of war, wrote a book,
Wartime, on the cultural effects of World War II. Surveying the culture
of that period, he endorsed the view of historian Eileen Sullivan, who
wrote, \"[**There was no room in this war culture for individual
opinions or personalities, no freedom of dissent or approval; the
culture was homogeneous, shallow and boring**.\"]{.underline}
\[...continues...\] Don\'t make the mistake of interpreting the events
of Sept. 11 purely in terms of terrorism and murder. . . . The
terrorists are a virulent subset of a much larger group of
anticapitalists, one that includes many politicians, bureaucrats,
writers, media types, academics, entertainers, trade unionists and, at
times, church leaders. The barbarians at the gates are more numerous
than you thought. But the most important cultural effect of conflict is
that it breeds a certain bloody-mindedness or, to put it more grandly, a
tragic view of life. Life in times of war and recession reminds us of
certain hard truths that were easy to ignore during the decade of peace
and prosperity. [**Evil exists.** Difficulties, even tragedies, are
**inevitable**. Human beings are flawed creatures capable of
monstrosity. Not all cultures are compatible**. To preserve order, good
people must exercise power over destructive people.**]{.underline} That
means that [it\'s no longer sufficient to deconstruct ideas and texts
and signifiers**. You have to be able to construct hard principles so
you can move from one idea to the next**, because when you are faced
with the problem of repelling evil, you absolutely must be able to reach
a conclusion on serious moral issues.]{.underline} This means you need
to think in moral terms about force \-- and to be tough-minded. During
the Cold War, Reinhold Niebuhr was a major intellectual figure. In 1952,
he wrote The Irony of American History. The tragedy of the conflict with
communism, he argued, was that, \"though confident of its virtue,
**[\[America\] must yet hold atomic bombs ready for use so as to prevent
a possible world conflagration]{.underline}**.\" The irony of our
history, he continued, is that we are an idealistic nation that dreams
of creating a world of pure virtue, yet in defeating our enemies we
sometimes have to act in ways that are not pure. \"We take, and must
continue to take, morally hazardous action to preserve our
civilization,\" Niebuhr wrote. \"**[We must exercise our
power]{.underline}**.\" We have to do so while realizing that we will
not be capable of perfect disinterestedness when deciding which actions
are just. We will be influenced by dark passions. **[But we still have
to act forcefully because our enemies are trying to destroy the basis of
civilization: \"We are drawn into an historic situation in which the
paradise of our domestic security is suspended in a hell of global
insecurity]{.underline}**.\" Niebuhr\'s prescription was humble
hawkishness. He believed the United States should forcefully defend
freedom and destroy its enemies. But while doing so, it should seek
forgiveness for the horrible things it might have to do in a worthy
cause. To reach this graduate-school level of sophistication, you have
to have passed through elementary courses in moral reasoning. It will be
interesting to see whether we Americans, who sometimes seem unsure of
even the fundamental moral categories, can educate ourselves
sufficiently to engage in the kind of moral reasoning that Niebuhr did.
The greatest political effect of this period of conflict will probably
be to relegitimize central institutions. Since we can\'t defend
ourselves as individuals against terrorism, we have to rely on the
institutions of government: the armed forces, the FBI, the CIA, the CDC,
and so on. We are now only beginning to surrender some freedoms, but we
will trade in more, and willingly. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the
Federalist Papers, \"Safety from external danger is the most powerful
director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will,
after a time, give way to its dictates. . . . To be more safe,
\[people\] at length become willing to run the risk of being less
free.\" Moreover, we will see power migrate from the states and Capitol
Hill to the White House. \"It is of the nature of war to increase the
executive at the expense of the legislative authority,\" Hamilton
continued. This creates rifts on both left and right, because both
movements contain anti-establishment elements hostile to any effort to
relegitimize central authorities. The splits have been most spectacular
on the left. Liberals who work in politics \-- Democrats on Capitol
Hill, liberal activists, academics who are interested in day-to-day
politics \-- almost all support President Bush and the war effort. But
many academic and literary leftists, ranging from Eric Foner to Susan
Sontag to Noam Chomsky, have been sour, critical, and contemptuous of
America\'s response to September 11. The central difference is that the
political liberals are comfortable with power. They want power
themselves and do not object to the central institutions of government,
even the military, exercising power on our behalf. Many [literary and
academic liberals, on the other hand, have built a whole moral system
around powerlessness.]{.underline} They champion the outgroups. [They
stand with the victims of hegemony, patriarchy, colonialism, and all the
other manifestations of central authority. Sitting on their campuses,
they are powerless themselves]{.underline}, and have embraced a
delicious, self-glorifying identity as the out-manned sages who alone
can see through the veils of propaganda in which the powerful hide their
oppressive schemes. For these thinkers, virtue inheres in the powerless.
The weak are sanctified, not least because they are voiceless and
allegedly need academics to give them voices. These outgroup leftists
dislike the Taliban, but to ally themselves with American power would be
to annihilate everything they have stood for and the role they have
assigned themselves in society. \[...continues...\] For Bush, the leader
of the free world, the issue is terrorism, not street crime. But now he
too is engaged in the effort to restore order so that people can go
about their lives. He is the one rounding up the posse, forsaking social
issues and other moral debates for a straightforward act of
international prosecution. He is reasserting authority to show that
under Pax Americana, the world is governable. \[...continues...\] But
history never repeats itself neatly. No one can predict the political
and cultural consequences of a war, any more than the course of the war
itself. But it does seem clear that we have moved out of one political
and cultural moment and into another. We have traded the anxieties of
affluence for the real fears of war. We have moved from an age of peace
to an age of conflict, and in times of conflict people are different.
They go to extremes. Some people, and some nations, turn cowardly or
barbaric. Other people, and other nations, become heroic, brave, and
steadfast. It all depends on what they have in them. War isn\'t only, as
Bourne said, the health of the state. It\'s the gut-check of the nation.

### Securitization Turn

#### New security frameworks and a move away from securitization causes the state to become more interventionist---turns the K

Tara **McCormack, '10**, Lecturer in International Politics at the
University of Leicester, 2010, (Critique, Security and Power: The
political limits to emancipatory approaches, page 127-129)

The following section will briefly raise some questions about the
[rejection of the old security framework]{.underline} as it has been
taken up by the most powerful institutions and states. [Here we can
begin to see the political limits to critical and emancipatory
frameworks]{.underline}. In an international system which is marked by
great power inequalities between states, the [rejection of
the]{.underline} old narrow national [interest-based security
framework]{.underline} by major international institutions, [and the
adoption of]{.underline} ostensibly [emancipatory policies]{.underline}
and policy rhetoric, [has the consequence of **problematising weak or
unstable states** and allowing international institutions or major
states **a more interventionary role**]{.underline}, yet [without
establishing mechanisms by which the citizens of states being intervened
in might have any control over the agents or agencies of their
emancipation]{.underline}. [Whatever the problems associated with the
pluralist security framework **there were at least formal and clear
demarcations**]{.underline}. [This has the consequence of **entrenching
international power inequalities** and allowing for a shift towards a
hierarchical international order in which the citizens in weak or
unstable states may arguably have even less freedom or power than
before]{.underline}. Radical critics of contemporary security policies,
such as human security and humanitarian intervention, argue that we see
an assertion of Western power and the creation of liberal subjectivities
in the developing world. For example, see Mark Duffield's important and
insightful contribution to the ongoing debates about contemporary
international security and development. Duffield attempts to provide a
coherent empirical engagement with, and theoretical explanation of,
these shifts. Whilst these shifts, away from a focus on state security,
and the so-called merging of security and development are often
portrayed as positive and progressive shifts that have come about
because of the end of the Cold War, Duffield argues convincingly that
these shifts are highly problematic and unprogressive. For example, the
rejection of sovereignty as formal international equality and a
presumption of nonintervention has eroded the division between the
international and domestic spheres and led to an international
environment in which Western NGOs and powerful states have a major role
in the governance of third world states. Whilst for supporters of
humanitarian intervention this is a good development, [Duffield points
out the depoliticising implications, drawing on examples in Mozambique
and Afghanistan]{.underline}. [Duffield also draws out the problems of
the retreat from modernisation that is represented by sustainable
development]{.underline}. The Western world has moved away from the
development policies of the Cold War, which aimed to develop third world
states industrially. Duffield describes this in terms of a new division
of human life into uninsured and insured life. Whilst we in the West are
'insured' -- that is we no longer have to be entirely self-reliant, we
have welfare systems, a modern division of labour and so on --
sustainable development aims to teach populations in poor states how to
survive in the absence of any of this. [Third world populations must be
taught to be self-reliant, they will remain uninsured. Self-reliance of
course means **the condemnation of millions to** **a barbarous life of
inhuman bare survival**.]{.underline} Ironically, although sustainable
development is celebrated by many on the left today, by leaving people
to fend for themselves rather than developing a society wide system
which can support people, [sustainable development actually leads to a
less human and humane system than that developed in modern capitalist
states]{.underline}. Duffield also describes how many of these
problematic shifts are embodied in the contemporary concept of human
security. For Duffield, [we can understand these shifts in terms of
Foucauldian biopolitical framework]{.underline}, which can be understood
as [a regulatory power that seeks to support life through intervening in
the biological, social and economic processes that constitute a human
population]{.underline} (2007: 16). Sustainable development and human
security are for Duffield technologies of security which aim to *create*
self-managing and self-reliant subjectivities in the third world, which
can then survive in a situation of serious underdevelopment (or being
uninsured as Duffield terms it) without causing security problems for
the developed world. For Duffield this is all driven by a neoliberal
project which seeks to control and manage uninsured populations
globally. Radical critic Costas Douzinas (2007) also criticises new
forms of cosmopolitanism such as human rights and interventions for
human rights as a triumph of American hegemony. Whilst we are in
agreement with critics such as Douzinas and Duffield that [these new
security frameworks cannot be empowering, and ultimately lead to more
power for powerful sta**tes**,]{.underline} we need to understand why
these frameworks have the effect that they do. We can understand that
these frameworks have political limitations without having to look for a
specific plan on the part of current powerful states. In new security
frameworks such as human security we can see the political limits of the
framework proposed by critical and emancipatory theoretical approaches.

### Interventionism Good Turn

#### US interventionism is good -- it's the [only alternative]{.underline} to [mass death]{.underline}.

Finessing the Disaster And yet [in Kosovo]{.underline} (this had almost
happened in Bosnia), [the West was finally hoist on the petard of its
own lip service to the categorical imperative of human rights. It was
ashamed not to intervene, but it lacked the will to do so with either
vision or coherence]{.underline}. Kosovo is probably a lost cause; it is
certainly ruined for a generation, whatever eventual deal is worked out,
as Bosnia, whose future is to be a ward of NATO, America, and the
European Union, probably for decades, has also been ruined for a
generation, Dayton or no Dayton. What remains are the modalities through
which this disaster can be finessed, and its consequences mitigated. [It
is to be hoped that in the wake of Kosovo, the realization that this
kind of geo-strategic frivolity and ad hoc-ism, this resolve to act out
of moral paradigms that now command the sympathy but do not yet command
the deep allegiance of Western public opinion-at least not to the extent
that people are willing to sacrifice in order to see that they are
upheld-will no longer do.]{.underline} [To say this is **not to suggest
that there are any obvious alternatives**.]{.underline} Even if one
accepts more of its premises than I do, the human rights perspective
clearly is insufficient. As for [the United Nations]{.underline}, it
[has been shown to be **incapable** of playing the dual role of both
succoring populations at risk while simultaneously acting like a
colonial power and imposing some kind of order and rebuilding civic
institutions. The important Third World countries seem to have **neither
the resources nor the ideological inclination to intervene** even in
their own regions, as Africa\'s failure to act in Rwanda in 1994
demonstrated so painfully]{.underline}. [The conclusion is
inescapable]{.underline}. At the present time, **[only the West has both
the power and]{.underline}**, however intermittently, [**the readiness
to act**. And by the West, one]{.underline} really [means the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Obviously, to say that America
could act effectively if it chose to do so as, yes, the world\'s
policeman of last resort, is not the same thing as saying that it
should. Those who argue, as George Kennan has done, that we overestimate
ourselves when we believe we can right the wrongs of the world, must be
listened to seriously. So should the views of principled isolationists.
And those on what remains of the left who insist that the result of such
a broad licensing of American power will be a further entrenchment of
America\'s hegemony over the rest of the world are also unquestionably
correct. What Is to Be Done But [the implications of not doing anything
are]{.underline} equally [clear. **Those who fear American power
are**]{.underline}-this is absolutely certain-[**condemning other people
to death**. Had the U.S. armed forces not set up the air bridge to
eastern Zaire in the wake of the Rwandan genocide, **hundreds of
thousands of people would have perished**]{.underline}, rather than the
tens of thousands who did die. This does not excuse the Clinton
administration for failing to act to stop the genocide militarily; but
it is a fact. [And analogous situations were found in Bosnia
and]{.underline} even, for all its failings, in the operation in
[Somalia]{.underline}.

### Perm Solvency -- Movements

#### Only the perm solves -- movements fail without showing credible political alternatives, and their anti-reformist ideological purity prevents true democracy.

[Being anti-something can be politically useful,]{.underline} but [only
**up to a point.**]{.underline} The [protesters]{.underline} of Seattle
and similar events [have been very effective in **pointing out**
authoritarian aspects of the capitalist world-system]{.underline}. Even
if various groups that have participated in these events do have
programmatic statements for alternative futures, [the way these events
have been staged has **not been very conducive in showing these futures
to the world**. The criticism of **not being able to show a credible
alternative**]{.underline}, or any alternative at all, [has become a
problem for the legitimacy of the protest movements.]{.underline}

In most of the post-Seattle events, [the protesters have often been
labeled as "antiglobalization,"]{.underline} and some of them have used
the expression themselves. 24 [It would]{.underline}, however, [be
**analytically faulty and politically unwise to simply define the
movements as being against** globalization, if the term is understood as
the increasing transgression of nation-state borders on a worldwide
level. Many of them are]{.underline}, I would claim, [looking for a
different kind of globalization]{.underline}, though some may prefer to
use the older term internationalism. From a democratic perspective, the
problem in some antiglobalization rhetoric is that one easily ends up
with rather strange bedfellows. [**Professing antiglobalization pure and
simple is not very helpful** in terms of making a distinction between
regulating the cross-border movements of speculative capital and those
of black immigrants.]{.underline}

Outra globalização (another globalization) is an expression that has
been emphasized by some of the key organizers of the Porto Alegre
meetings (Grzybowski 1998; de Souza Santos 2001). Despite their
insistence, the mass media in many parts of Latin America often talks of
antiglobalization activists when referring to both Porto Alegre and some
of the events inspired by it. The February 2001 protests related to a
WEF regional meeting in Mexico and the March 2001 marches around the
Inter- American Development Bank meeting in Santiago de Chile were the
first big globalization-related protest events in Latin America after
the first WSF, and the media coverage of them often referred to the
Porto Alegre event as an important moment in the antiglobalization
struggles.25

[For those who want to argue for the possibility of a different kind of
globalization, the risk of ending up with strange bedfellows is by no
means absent. It is not always easy to see the differences, if any, of
the "alternative" globalization proposals with the idea of many business
leaders that some democratization is necessary in order to make the
global expansion of capitalism acceptable]{.underline} (Falk and Strauss
2001). [Those who cling to antiglobalization discourse are often right
when they claim that the alternative globalization strategies would only
lead to very moderate changes. Often, but **not always.**]{.underline}

[It is frequently assumed that in the anti/alternative divide of
globalization debates, **being "anti" represents more radical and
revolutionary options, whereas the "alternatives" are on the side of
more superficial reforms**]{.underline}. [In terms of thinking about how
to democratize the world, **this assumption is not very
helpful.**]{.underline} [Within the alternative globalization specter,
it is possible to find and even easier to imagine such political
projects that strive for a globalization that radically transforms the
world. While antiglobalization people can be pro-capitalist,
pro-globalization people may be anticapitalist.]{.underline}

[Some of the debate and divide between the "anti" and the "alternative"
is due to **confused semantics or distorted categorizations**. In order
to fundamentally democratize the world, **people who have chosen to
regard globalization as a term that has been too polluted by its
dominant usage and those who think it can still be given more
progressive meanings can often work together**]{.underline}. In
principle, the WSF offers many opportunities for this to happen.
