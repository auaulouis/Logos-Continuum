### US-NATO Key

**US and NATO cooperation is key to counter cyber-threats**

**Alexander '12** (David, Correspondent in Jerusalem, New Delhi and
London. 20+ years in Washington, with stints at Pentagon, White House,
"Global cyber arms race engulfing web -- Defense official," Reuters,
April 10, 2012,
https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-defense-cyber/global-cyber-arms-race-engulfing-web-defense-official-idUSL2E8FADH320120411)-AT

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - [A global cyber arms race is engulfing
the Internet and the best way to counter the rapidly escalating threat
is combining the efforts of U.S. agencies, private firms and
international allies]{.underline}, cyber security officials said on
Tuesday. Cyber experts from across the U.S. government, speaking at a
conference at Georgetown University, said organized crime, espionage and
security activity on the Internet pose a rising threat to U.S.
intellectual property, military superiority and critical infrastructure.
"What we're looking at is a global cyber arms race," said Rear Admiral
Samuel Cox, director of intelligence at U.S. Cyber Command, which was
set up 18 months ago to protect Pentagon computer networks and conduct
offensive cyber operations if the president orders them. "It's not
proceeding at a leisurely or even a linear fashion but in fact is
accelerating. I wouldn't claim that it's following Moore's law, but the
curve looks kind of similar," he said, referring to a computer industry
rule of thumb that computer processing power doubles every couple of
years. Howard Schmidt, cyber security coordinator at the White House,
said more than \$8 trillion worth of transactions were carried over
wired and wireless networks each year. "This is not just a national
security issue," he told the conference. "It's a national security,
public safety as well as economic." [Officials said the most effective
way to counter the threat is to adopt an approach that promotes
collaboration among government agencies and reaches out to private
industry as well as international partners]{.underline}. TEAM SPORT. "To
really operate effectively in cyberspace \... it's really a team sport,"
said Steven Schleien, the principal director for cyber policy at the
Pentagon. That's why [the Defense Department has been working with
private companies and allies like NATO, Japan and South Korea to discuss
information sharing and coordinated responses]{.underline} to incidents
on the Internet, he said. NATO wants to bring all of the civilian and
military networks in the organization under the wing of the NATO
Computer Incident Response Capability by the end of 2012, which would
allow a coordinated response to cyber attacks. [The United States has
begun discussions]{.underline} on cyber security with Japan, South Korea
and New Zealand, and is working closely with the Britain and Australia
[on a "full spectrum" of cooperation in cyberspace]{.underline},
Schleien said. [The United States]{.underline} does not view arms
control treaties as a means of dealing with the problem but [would like
to see the international community agree on norms of behavior for
cyberspace]{.underline}, he said. "This is not an area where arms
control works. I don't know what we would monitor. I don't know how we
would verify anything in terms of cyber weapons or cyber tools,"
Schleien said. Discussions on norms of behavior would begin to address
the issue of how to fight proxies who carry out Internet attacks on
behalf of governments, and "hactivists," who attack computer networks
for their own political ends. "How do you deal with hactivists from your
soil?" Schleien asked. "Are you responsible as a sovereign nation for
what comes out of your country?" The issues are sensitive and complex. A
U.S. nonprofit group, for example, concluded Russian civilians acting
with advance notice of Russian military intentions carried out cyber
attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. Some websites used to
organize those attacks were hosted in the United States.

#### NATO using leading members tech is key

**Berger '21** (Federico Berger, Junior Fellow at NDCF, "The Alliance in
the loop: NATO and Artificial Intelligence," NATO Defense College
Foundation. 12/21.
<https://www.natofoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NDCF-Paper-Berger-NATO-and-Artificial-Intelligence-151121.pdf>)

I[n a context where an enhanced AI adoption in the defense sector seems
imminent, the NATO Defense College's paper "NATO-mation" cleary outlines
a set of priorities for the Alliance to develop a coherent approach,
with some of them that should be at the very heart of the
issue.]{.underline} First of all, the Alliance should establish ethical
principles around which the development of these systems remains in-line
with the founding principles of the transatlantic bond. This would be an
opportunity to become a trend-setter in the international arena in an
ethical approach towards R&D. Second on the list, [**NATO Allies should
work together to innovate their workforce**, as the human side of the
process becomes ever more crucial in a highly interactive work
environment. A further focus should be given to Hacking for Defense-type
initiatives, **but also to the support of creative individuals and
innovators of the sector.** Third, the Alliance needs to develop new
concepts and doctrines to establish clearly which fields of AI are more
promising and attracts investments from a defense
perspective]{.underline}. To this extent, simulations, exercises, and
wargames are essential, also to develop common standards, approaches,
and priority areas among Allies. The fourth point involves maintaining
NATO and Allies' technological edge over the adversaries. Reinvigorating
investments in R&D is the very first condition, but promoting
cooperation as well as coordination on investments and reforms must not
be forgotten. Finally, the pressing issue of arms control[. The Alliance
has historically played an important role in deterrence and defence as a
forum for discussion, and the field of AI must not be an exception. With
the adoption of AI becoming pervasive and the rise of Lethal Autonomous
Weapon Systems (LAWS), **Allies should pay attention at identifying
potential multilateral solutions which preserve international
stability**. As a matter of fact, the Alliance needs more than ever
cohesion and collaboration to face the multiple challenges deriving from
technological revolutions]{.underline}. But as Ambassador d'Aboville
precisely pointed out in the NDCF Game Changers 2020 Dossier: NATO
Defense College Foundation Paper "NATO offers proven consultative
mechanisms and a unique network for collaboration on defence and
security questions, being a natural platform for collaboration. \[...\]
[But for such a debate to be productive, one has first to convince the
decision makers and the public in the Alliance that these technologies
applied to defence have an increasing momentum on their own, and, if we
want to redirect it towards our own security interests (or convince
others that there is a potential shared interest through arms control),
we cannot be complacent or ignore facts. **Denying ourselves these
capabilities will not stop potential adversaries in pursuing them for
their own interests**."]{.underline}

#### US law limits private entities from hacking back -- have to be cautious with private sectors

chair and as assistant professor for security studies at the National
War College. He has served as a leader and aviator in the US Coast Guard
and the US Army, as advisor to the commandant of the Coast Guard, as

Limitations to Offensive Public-Private Cybersecurity Partnerships

[**US law**---specifically, 18 US Code § 1030---**prevents private
entities from hacking into another computer system**. Proponents of
hack-back policies find this law overly restrictive.]{.underline}
Indeed, frustration with current policies has led to action by the
government. [Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed
at loosening restrictions on hacking back.]{.underline} Some advocates
have gone even further by proposing modern day letters of marque
authorizing certain companies or individuals to act on behalf of the
government to disable or disrupt the attacking systems. Moreover,
**[hacking back is not as simple as it seems and there are good
arguments for a cautious approach]{.underline}**. **[While proponents of
authorizing the private sector to hack back typically also advocate for
governmental oversite, it is unclear that the government has the
capacity or the expertise to provide it.]{.underline}** Indeed, Jason
Healy and Robert Jervis have argued convincingly that US government
departments and agencies involved in cybersecurity are rarely even able
to maintain awareness of offensive cyber operations conducted by other
US government departments and agencies. Additionally, **[attribution for
cyberattacks is not easy]{.underline}**. The bad guys often originate
their attacks from innocent users' machines they have taken over,
employing bots, botnets, or zombies. Disabling or destroying the
machines hurts innocent users (they are also victims of the hackers) and
not the actual attackers. [Imagine the potential harms if an attack was
made to appear to have originated from a hospital's IT network. Hacking
back could result in real loss of life.]{.underline} Furthermore, while
there is a lot of focus on offense and the ability to strike back, too
much offense can create other problems, like instability in
international relations. **[A back-and-forth exchange of cyberattacks
between nation-states can spiral quickly beyond what either nation
intended. What started out in the cyber world can escalate into
brinkmanship and lethal force.]{.underline}** In short, the [United
States is right to be cautious with empowering private entities to act
offensively on behalf of the government]{.underline}. The past twenty
years has demonstrated that the use of [private military contractors
comes with its own issues.]{.underline} [Scandals surrounding Blackwater
and other contractors has shown what happens when government allows
privatization of inherent government functions.]{.underline}

### NATO Key

#### NATO is key for a unified response.

Security Policy, with a concentration in technology and cybersecurity\]
\"Beyond NATO's Madrid Summit: the technological challenge,\" Real
Instituto Elcano,

AL

First, it will be strategic to make a list of priorities on EDTs in two
ways. [NATO has already defined seven priority areas, but for each of
them it would be advisable to specify their level of criticality. A
distinction needs to be made between critical, significant, limited
impact and 'peripheral' technologies]{.underline}. This is no simple
task. It is an effort already developed by some allied countries, such
as the recently updated US White House list of critical technologies.
The second approach to prioritising some EDTs over others is to make an
assessment of the contribution these EDTs make to Alliance defence and
security in the short, medium and long terms. [Delineating these
timeframes can help allocate resources efficiently and avoid potential
duplication. This]{.underline} is beneficial both for NATO and for
Allies individually, and [could prevent]{.underline} the [lack of
coordination and coherence]{.underline} found in the Inspector General's
2020 audit on AI projects being developed in the US Department of
Defense. [Moreover]{.underline}, it is not only beneficial at the
tactical level: [it can also improve strategic decision-making when it
comes to determining what role NATO should play in deterring certain
technological developments by third countries.]{.underline} The second
challenge is to make innovation projects flexible and agile. The DIANA
mechanism will focus on deep technologies, which are the seven priority
areas the Alliance has already identified (artificial intelligence, big
data processing, quantum technologies, autonomy, biotechnology, novel
materials and space), making it necessary for start-ups, research teams
and technology companies participating in the network of accelerators
and testing centres in more than 20 allied countries to reinvent their
projects in the event of failure or non-delivery. Many of the partner
countries are also members of the EU. The EU-NATO Joint Declaration is
expected to be published later this year to identify lines of
cooperation. The NATO Innovation Fund, which is the world's first
multi-sovereign venture capital fund, DIANA, and the EU's European
Innovation Council should work together to enable specialised but small
start-ups to grow smoothly. Finally, perception will also be important.
Non-NATO countries from the Asia-Pacific area will attend the Madrid
Summit, including Australia, Korea, Japan and New Zealand. The first and
third cooperate bilaterally with the US through the Quad, Australia
already does so through AUKUS and the EU is working on Digital
Partnership Agreements with Korea and Japan. [Given this multiplicity of
initiatives, ensuring mutual trust and confidence in technology projects
--within NATO-- will be important for their long-term
sustainability]{.underline}. Moreover, discussions in recent years about
creating a potential NATO policy on China are still incomplete and will
be a sensitive issue, as countries have different views on how to engage
with China politically, militarily and technologically. In conclusion,
the Strategic Concept 2022 is a window of opportunity. And, as such, it
will reveal many challenges. [Working from the outset with a holistic
approach will be a necessary condition for success.]{.underline}

Social Contract Theory and Government Response

Increased **[familiarity with cyberattacks is accompanied by an
understanding of the threat they pose to all aspects of daily
life]{.underline}.** It also comes with a growing **[frustration of
what]{.underline}** many feel is an **[ineffective government response
to punish those responsible, and to thereby deter others.]{.underline}**

The United States was founded on the ideals of seventeenth-century
social contract theory, the intellectual progeny of philosophers like
Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. They argued that citizens and governments
form a contract; the people give up certain freedoms in exchange for
government guarantees of law and order. It is this contract that allows
for societies to peacefully exist. For example, if Jill is wronged by
Jack, Jill does not take the response into her own hands, but trusts the
government to represent her interests. The alternative to the social
contract is a state of anarchy where might makes right, and thus a
failure of civil society.

One of the most [understood freedoms given up to the government under
social contract theory is security]{.underline}. **[The government is
responsible for defending society against security
threats.]{.underline}** As, the early twentieth-century theorist Max
Weber noted, a monopoly on violence is a central attribute of modern
states. Concomitantly, it should not be surprising that the US
[government has vigorously sought to defend its population against
physical violence perpetrated both by state actors, as well as by a
diverse panoply of violent nonstate actors]{.underline} (e.g., terrorist
groups and violent extremists, drug trafficking organizations). However,
in broadening the aperture beyond physical security
[threats]{.underline} to also include those emanating **[from the cyber
domain, the results become far more mixed.]{.underline}** **[While the
US government almost certainly desires to be responsive to its citizens
cybersecurity needs, it lacks a firm understanding as to how to
effectively do so.]{.underline}**

### Cooperation Good

#### Maintaining balance to US China relations key to mitigate conflict and maintain US heg

**Crawford '22** (Shannon K. Crawford, 5-26-2022, \"Blinken describes
delicate balance between isolating and enabling China,\" ABC News,
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-describes-delicate-balance-isolating-enabling-china/story?id=84992791)

[In the eyes of the Biden administration, **China is a daunting rival
and an ever-present risk to global security**. **But** it\'s **also a
necessary partner** for tackling some of the world\'s most pressing
issues. During an address laying out the president\'s policy towards
China]{.underline}, Secretary of State Antony Blinken described a
delicate balance between isolating and enabling the country, calling it
the \"[**most serious, long-term challenge\" to the global balance**.
\"**China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the
international order and increasingly, the economic diplomatic military
and technological power to do it**,]{.underline}\" he said. \"Beijing\'s
vision would move us away from the universal values that have sustained
so much of the world\'s progress over the past 75 years.\" Blinken
boiled the quagmire down into a single phrase. \"Put simply, the
[**United States and China have to deal with each other for the
foreseeable future**,\" he said. \"That\'s why this is one of the **most
complex and consequential relationships** of any that we have **in the
world** today.\"]{.underline} The secretary said that while the
administration was already employing strategies to curb China\'s
influence, it would not try to limit its growth or create new Cold War.
But while Blinken maintained that peace was its core goal, he vowed the
U.S. would not compromise it own goals. \"**[Competition need not lead
to conflict. We do not seek it. We will work to avoid it. But we will
defend our interests against any threat]{.underline}**,\" he said.
Blinken acknowledged that China had undergone meteoric growth in the
past half-century, but said its own people and other countries caught in
its crosshairs had paid the price. \"Under President Xi, the ruling
Chinese Communist Party has become more repressive at home and more
aggressive abroad,\" he said, citing mass surveillance, power grabs in
the South China Sea, widespread human rights violations, the subversion
of trade rules and more. Blinken also noted the country\'s repression of
freedom in Hong Kong, its brutal treatment of religious and ethnic
minorities in Tibet and the Xinjiang region, and its indignation over
any international criticism over draconian measures employed against its
citizens. \"Beijing insists that these are somehow internal matters,
that others have no right to raise. That is wrong,\" Blinken said. The
secretary also reaffirmed the One China policy, which was called into
question earlier this week when President Biden he would defend Taiwan
militarily before walking back his statements. Blinken said the U.S.
still acknowledges only one Chinese government, but said its posture
towards Taiwan had intensified. \"What has changed is [Beijing\'s
growing coercion by trying to cut off Taiwan\'s relations with countries
around the world and blocking it from participating in international
organizations,\" he said, adding that China regularly put on shows of
force by flying military aircraft near the island. \"These words and
actions are deeply destabilizing]{.underline}. They risk miscalculation
and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.\" For all its
commitment to its own territorial integrity, Blinken argued China\'s
unwavering alliance with Russia was hypocritical. \"Even while Russia
was clearly mobilizing to invade Ukraine, [President Xi and President
Putin declared that the friendship between their countries was and I
quote, without limits]{.underline},\" he said. Blinken repeatedly
stressed that the **[aim of the administration was not exclude China
from the world market]{.underline}**. Instead, senior administration
officials say they want to make sure it \"plays by the same rules as
everyone else.\" Blinken said that by creating dependencies, Beijing was
\"seeking to make China less dependent on the world and the world more
dependent on China.\" \"For our part, we want trade and investment as
long as they\'re fair, and don\'t jeopardize our national security,\" he
added. He warned other countries to go into trade partnerships with open
eyes, wary of retaliation should they adopt a stance China disagrees
with. \"Many of our partners already had a painful experience, how
Beijing can come down hard when they make choices that it dislikes,\" he
said. The secretary predicted the ideological battle between superpowers
would be decided in the next 10 years. \"[President Biden believes
**this decade will be decisive**,\" Blinken said, outlining the
administration\'s three pronged approach. \"The Biden administration
strategy can be summed up in three words, invest, align,
compete.]{.underline}\" Invest, he said, referred to invigorating
industry, technology and research to ensure the U.S. was up to par with
China in these arenas. Align meant strengthening ties with key allies.
Blinken said efforts to do both these things were already underway
through initiatives like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and revived
geopolitical partnerships. But to truly compete, he contended that more
needed to be done \-- calling on Congress to resolve a months\' long
stalemate and send a massive spending bill aimed at ramping up the
country\'s ability to economically contend with China to the
president\'s desk. \"[Beijing is determined to lead, but given
America\'s advantages, the **competition is ours to lose** \-- not only
in terms of developing new technologies, but also in **shaping** how
they\'re used around **the world**, so that they\'re rooted in
democratic values, not authoritarian ones,\" he implored]{.underline}.

#### China will not upend the liberal world order -- It's not important to compete with China

**Williams '21** (Michael John Williams; senior fellow with the
Scowcroft Center's Transatlantic Security Initiative and associate
professor of International Affairs and director of the International
Relations Program at the Maxwell School for Citizenship and Public
Affairs at Syracuse University; September 21, 2021; Atlantic Council

DOA: 7/3/22)

The Biden administration's **[refrain of "America is
Back"]{.underline}** increasingly **[rings hollow, especially in
Europe]{.underline}**. While its decision to enter into the AUKUS pact
is logical, given its focus on China and the Asia-Pacific region, the
way it was reached [undermines the very order that the Biden team
supposedly wants to uphold]{.underline}. The **[so-called]{.underline}**
**["liberal world order"]{.underline}** (of [which the United States is
supposedly the guardian]{.underline}) **[rests upon American
hegemony]{.underline}**, which itself is premised on the consent of the
governed. The foundations of the "liberal world order" are [based on the
American hegemony in Europe and Asia established after the end of World
War II]{.underline}. Although Europe may increasingly seem less
important to many officials in Washington, it remains a fundamental base
of American legitimacy and power. Yet during a time when Washington
seeks to garner allied support to contain China, the Biden
administration needs to remember the [importance of linkages in foreign
policy]{.underline}. [France has always been one of the more
obstreperous allies]{.underline}, and thus the coarse treatment of Paris
with respect to AUKUS will set the stage for increasing discord. AUKUS
was a second strike that came on the heels of what Europeans consider to
have been a [botched withdrawal from Afghanistan]{.underline}---done
more via declaration than consultation---which incentivized European
allies to view themselves as increasingly distant from the United
States. This could have the positive effect of more European capability
development, but conversely, it [may make European allies less willing
to back the United States on other issues]{.underline}. It seems that
the Biden administration considers itself the only game in town, and
therefore it doesn't need to worry about what **[allies think, since
there's no way the European Union could reconcile itself with a
Chinese-led world order.]{.underline}** This is a dangerous assumption.
The **[American argument is]{.underline}** that **[China will upend the
liberal world order]{.underline}**. It is true that China does not place
much stock in liberal values such as human rights; it is, after all, a
market-oriented dictatorship. But t**[his doesn't mean that China is
going to upend the entire international system]{.underline}**. Instead,
it may s**[eek a global order that is more reminiscent of the past, in
which sovereignty and free-market economics reign
supreme]{.underline}**. This might not be an ideal world from a US point
of view---but it may not seem all that bad to the rest of the world.

### Competition Not Key

#### **The US doesn't need to compete with China.**

**Xu and Shen '19** (Hailin and Yi, head of Fudan University\'s
Cyberspace Governance Research Institute, "With stepped up cyberattacks
on China, US seeks online hegemony," Global Times, June 13, 2019,
https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1153909.shtml)-AT

[The US has been accusing China of being the main cybersecurity threat,
but]{.underline} based on CNCERT data, [US topped the list of sources of
such online assaults]{.underline}, Xinhua quoted an expert as saying.
[In terms of security, the US always adopts double
standards]{.underline}. In fact, it has been proved that [the US is the
**principal threat to global cybersecurity.**]{.underline} This threat
refers not only to Trojan programs that originate in the US; [it
is]{.underline} probably [the only country in the world that pursues
offensive cybersecurity strategy and considers a unipolar hegemonic
order dominated by it in cyberspace as its strategic goal]{.underline}.
What [the US is seeking]{.underline} has never been an equal order in
cyberspace, but the exclusive freedom of action and asymmetric,
[US-centered hegemonic order]{.underline}. This is the biggest threat
faced by the online world today. We should do away with assumptions that
the US is a fair, rational and responsible hegemonic power. It never
was, and that is an illusion it has tried to create. In April 2019, the
Washington D.C.-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation
found in its research that [China \"now leads the US\" in]{.underline}
some [scientific and technological areas]{.underline} compared to a
decade ago. Although there could be various motives behind the US
crackdown on Chinese high-tech enterprises that only the Americans know,
we can reasonably conclude that Washington is doing so to seek hegemony
in the internet sphere. [Washington founded the Cyber
Command]{.underline} in 2009 [and created 133 Cyber Mission Force
teams]{.underline}. Meanwhile in February, US Army General Paul
Nakasone, who also directs the National Security Agency, said he wants
to recruit more people to these teams. [These are some ways the US uses
to dominate cybespace]{.underline}, which will definitely add to its
military cyber capabilities. On the question of the US girding to launch
a cyber war, experts said there is not enough information to support the
conjecture. However, what is clear is that **[there will be no winner in
cyber warfare, and China will not be crushed given its
might]{.underline}**. Washington has listed Beijing as its main target
for cyberattacks. Such being the case, what we can do in the first place
is to improve our systematic defense capabilities at the national level.
President Xi Jinping said in his speech on cybersecurity in April 2016
that the country needs to build and perfect cyber defense and develop
its own cyber deterrence capacity. China must augment its cyber defense
and deterrence capabilities to prevent rivals from acting - just like
the nuclear sphere[.]{.underline} Such cyber capability itself is
neutral. It can be either defensive or offensive while it can be used to
either safeguard peace or dominate the world - depending on which
country masters it. As a peace-loving country, [China must have
sufficient technical capability to maintain peace and defend a just
order]{.underline}. [The US accuses China and Chinese companies of
posing a threat to its national and cybersecurity.]{.underline} In my
view, [people shouldn\'t believe]{.underline} a word of [Washington\'s
accusations]{.underline}. The US is not a conscientious hegemon but a
Janus-faced rogue. Why should we care about what the US says? The halo
of a soft power cannot preclude the US from being labeled a cyber
hegemon. US President Donald Trump\'s words and deeds have laid bare
Washington\'s real intentions.

#### [American Primacy in Asia is a waste of time and resources]{.underline}

**Roggeveen '21** (Sam Roggeveen, Director of the Lowy Institute\'s
International Security Program, "The price of American hegemony in
Asia," IPS Journal. 29/9/21.
https://www.ips-journal.eu/topics/foreign-and-security-policy/the-price-of-american-hegemony-in-asia-5449/)

[Nobody doubts that China is the driving motivation for AUKUS. If China
was not undergoing **the most rapid maritime modernisation of any
country since the US Navy under the Reagan Administration**, it is
difficult to imagine that Washington would have agreed to sell **nuclear
technology** it has only once before shared with a foreign partner (the
UK).]{.underline} Australia has been content to demonstrate its fidelity
to its alliance with the US by supporting Washington's security goals in
the Middle East and Afghanistan. Yet that still leaves open a critical
question about US grand strategy: are agreements such as AUKUS designed
to further America's ultimate aim of maintaining its status as
unrivalled strategic leader of Asia, or is the US willing to share power
with China? It is easy to make a case for the first interpretation, at
least based on what the United States says. [The Trump Administration's
Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific, declassified in January 2021,
says plainly that the uppermost challenge for US policy in the region is
'how to maintain **US strategic primacy'**. President Biden said in
March 2021 that 'China has an overall goal \[\...\] to become \[\...\]
the most powerful country in the world \[\...\] That's not going to
happen on my watch'. Yet **rhetoric has not been matched by
action**.]{.underline} America's military footprint in Asia hasn't grown
much over the last decade, especially when compared to the rapid rise of
Chinese military capacity. [Obama's 'pivot' to Asia, announced in 2011,
is widely acknowledged to have **been under-resourced**. In that
context, AUKUS can be seen a strong sign of American commitment to
containing China.]{.underline} Nuclear propulsion technology is closely
guarded, so this is much more than an ordinary arms deal; it is a major
commitment of American technology. And if primacy is the goal, then
Australia has made its clearest commitment yet to supporting it.
Australia has been content to demonstrate its fidelity to its alliance
with the US by supporting Washington's security goals in the Middle East
and Afghanistan. [China clearly means to revise what it regards as a
Western imposed rules-based order, and it would probably like to push
the US out of the region altogether. It has, however, been less
forthright when it comes to issues that directly affect Chinese
interests]{.underline}. For instance, despite American encouragement,
Australia has still not conducted freedom of navigation missions within
12 nautical miles of China's artificial islands in the South China Sea.
It joined China's international development bank while Washington
remained suspicious. And in 2019 the suggestion that the US might ask
Australia to host American intermediate-range missiles on its territory
was met with a swift denial by the Morrison Government. That period of
reticence appears to be over. As well as the submarine deal, the
Australian government is encouraging speculation about permanent
American bases in Australia[**. Is American primacy in Asia worth it?**
What's troubling about this is that it implies full confidence in
America's ability to win such a contest for leadership in Asia, and that
Australia must do what it can to ensure victory. But China is the
biggest challenger the US has ever faced.]{.underline} As former
Brookings scholar and now China adviser in the National Security Council
Rush Doshi has observed, in the last century no American adversary or
coalition of adversaries has ever reached 60 percent of US GDP. China
passed that mark as early as 2014. It's an arresting statistic, which
should encourage Australian policy-makers to ask if the maintenance of
American primacy in Asia is a realistic or even worthwhile goal. US
primacy has certainly been advantageous for Australia, but the price of
keeping America at the top is now rising dramatically. [European powers
should also be asking themselves about their interests in
Asia.]{.underline} Australia's decision to commit to either American or
British nuclear-powered submarines meant that the deal to buy French
boats had to be cancelled, leading to much introspection about France's
future role in the Pacific. Britain's involvement in AUKUS has also
raised questions about its ambitions in this part of the world[. In
June, NATO identified China as a 'systemic challenger'. But **it is
difficult to see what vital strategic interest is at stake for NATO and
the European powers in Asia**. China clearly means to revise what it
regards as a Western imposed rules-based order, and it would probably
like to push the US out of the region altogether. However, that **is not
enough reason for Europe to involve itself in a power struggle against a
nation that offers massive economic opportunity, but which poses no
military threat** to Europe.]{.underline}

As Russia threatens the largest land invasion in Europe since World War
II, the most consequential strategic question of the 21st century is
becoming clear[: How can the United States manage two revisionist,
autocratic, nuclear-armed great powers (Russia and China)
simultaneously?]{.underline} The answer, according to many politicians
and defense experts, is that Washington must moderate its response to
Russia in Europe to focus on the greater threat posed by China in the
Indo-Pacific. This would be a mistake. [**The United States** remains
the world's leading power with global interests, and it **cannot afford
to choose between Europe and the Indo-Pacific.**]{.underline} Instead[,
Washington and its allies should develop a defense strategy capable of
deterring and, if necessary, defeating Russia and China at the same
time.]{.underline} In recent weeks, Biden has sent several thousand U.S.
troops to reinforce NATO's eastern flank---and for good reason. A major
war in Ukraine could spill across international boundaries and threaten
the seven NATO allies that border Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine.
Moreover, if Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeds in Ukraine, why
would he stop there? Putin has shown a clear interest in resurrecting
the former Russian Empire, and other vulnerable Eastern European
countries---Poland, Romania, or the Baltic states---might be next. [A
successful Russian incursion into a NATO ally's territory could mean the
end of the Western alliance and the credibility of U.S. security
commitments globally.]{.underline} [The threat posed by China is also
serious]{.underline}. Adm. Philip Davidson, former commander of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, predicted China could invade Taiwan within the
next six years[. This is a war the United States might
lose]{.underline}. [If China succeeds in taking Taiwan, it would be well
on its way to disrupting the U.S.-led order in Asia, with an eye to
doing the same globally. Moreover, Russia and China are increasingly
working together.]{.underline} As this month's summit between Putin and
Chinese President Xi Jinping shows, Moscow and Beijing are forging a
closer strategic partnership, including on military matters. These
dictators could coordinate dual attacks on the U.S. alliance structure
or opportunistically seize on the distraction provided by the other's
aggression. In other words, there is a serious risk of simultaneous
major-power wars in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. To address this
problem, many have proposed answers that simply will not work. The Biden
administration initially hoped to put relations with Russia on a "stable
and predictable" footing to focus on China, but Putin had other ideas,
as the world is now seeing in Ukraine. Unfortunately, Washington does
not get to decide how its adversaries sequence their aggression. Others
have expressed hope that Washington can peel these powers apart or even
align with Russia against China, but these are not realistic solutions.
The misguided view gaining the most recent acceptance, however, is that
Washington should simply choose the Indo-Pacific over Europe.
Politicians and experts argue that the United States lacks the resources
to take on both Russia and China. They point to China's power and Asia's
wealth and argue that Asia should be the priority. While Washington
pivots to Asia, wealthy European countries, such as Germany, should step
up to provide for NATO's defense. Indeed, the Biden administration's
National Defense Strategy, which has been delayed due to the Ukraine
crisis, is expected to focus on China without offering a clear solution
to the two-front-war problem. A good strategy, however, starts with
clear goals, and Washington's objectives are to maintain peace and
stability in both Europe and Asia. U.S. interests in Europe are too
significant to let them be worked out solely between Putin and the
United States' European allies. Indeed, the European Union, not Asia, is
the United States' largest trade and investment partner, and this
imbalance is much starker when China (which the United States seeks
greater economic decoupling from), is removed from the equation.
Furthermore, China has conducted military exercises in Europe and the
Middle East. Competing with China militarily means competing globally,
not just in Asia. In addition, Xi is gauging U.S. resolve, and a weak
response in Ukraine might make a Chinese move on Taiwan more likely.
[Moreover, the United States is not France; it is not compelled to make
gut-wrenching strategic choices about its national security due to
constrained resources. In short, publishing a defense strategy that can
only handle one of the United States' great-power rivals (which is what
is expected from the forthcoming national defense strategy) is planning
to fail. Instead, the United States and its allies must design a defense
strategy capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating both Russia
and China in overlapping time frames. The pause in releasing Biden's
defense strategy provides an opportunity to go back to the drawing board
and get this right.]{.underline} To be sure[, developing such a strategy
will be challenging, but there are a number of ways to begin to square
the circle]{.underline}. First, Washington should increase defense
spending. Contrary to those who claim that constrained resources will
force tough choices, [the United States can afford to outspend Russia
and China at the same time]{.underline}. The United States possesses 24
percent of global GDP compared to a combined 19 percent in China and
Russia. This year, the United States will spend \$778 billion on defense
compared to only \$310 billion in Russia and China. Moreover, [the
United States could go so far as to double defense spending (currently
2.8 percent of GDP) and still remain below its Cold War average (close
to 7 percent of GDP).]{.underline} Indeed, given that this new Cold War
is every bit as dangerous as the last one, a meaningful increase in
defense spending, focused on the 21st century's emerging defense
technologies, is in order. Some might argue that the days of a U.S.
economic advantage are numbered due to China's rise, but China's
internal dysfunctions are catching up with it. Dictators like Xi
prioritize political control over economic performance. Xi is
undermining China's growth model by cracking down on the private sector
and rolling back liberalizing reforms, and his aggressive diplomacy is
upsetting international economic relationships. As a result, Beijing's
economy is stagnating. Russia's long-term economic outlook is even
worse. In short, even if this new strategic competition becomes a
two-versus-one arms race, Washington is likely to prevail. In addition,
[the United States can actively lead its allies in Europe and the
Indo-Pacific to develop a free world defense strategy]{.underline}. The
United States and its formal treaty allies possess nearly 60 percent of
global GDP, and together, they can easily marshal the resources to
maintain a favorable balance of military power over both China and
Russia. Preexisting formal alliances like NATO in Europe and bilateral
alliances in Asia can be supplemented with new arrangements, such as the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. European allies should invest in armor
and artillery while Asian allies buy naval mines, harpoon missiles, and
submarines. Allies do need, therefore, to step up and do more for their
defense, but they will not do it on their own if the United States
threatens to leave Europe. Instead, Washington should actively lead,
moving from a model where Washington provides defense to allies to one
where Washington contributes to allies' self-defense. This should
include incorporating key allies into military planning, sharing
responsibilities, and devising a rational division of labor for weapons
acquisition. European allies should invest in armor and artillery while
Asian allies buy naval mines, harpoon missiles, and submarines. The U.S.
Army should prioritize Europe while the U.S. Navy takes the Indo-Pacific
and a larger U.S. Air Force plays a significant role in both theaters.
In addition, the United States should provide strategic capabilities
like its nuclear umbrella; global conventional strike capabilities,
including hypersonic missiles; and intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance. Finally, if necessary, Washington could always take a
page from its Cold War playbook and rely more heavily on nuclear weapons
to offset the local, conventional advantages of its rivals. The presence
of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in Europe helped deter the massive
Soviet Red Army for decades. Similarly, the United States could rely on
threatening nonstrategic nuclear strikes to deter and, as a last resort,
thwart a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan or a Russian tank
incursion into Europe[. To be sure, there are risks associated with
nuclear deterrence, but nuclear weapons have played a foundational role
in U.S. defense strategy for three-quarters of a century---and will
likely continue to do so for decades to come. **Deterring China and
Russia at the same time will not be easy, but it is better than
pretending Washington can deal with one major-power rival or the other
at its convenience**. Thank goodness, former U.S. President Franklin
Roosevelt did not choose victory in only one theater during World War
II. **Biden should** follow his exampl**e and plan to defend U.S.
interests in Europe and the Indo-Pacific at the same
time.**]{.underline}
