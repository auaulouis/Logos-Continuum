# 1ac -- Cognitive Warfare

#### Inherency -- NATO guidelines for combating disinformation remain placed on the backburner to national-level response and relies on E.U. rapid response infrastructure.

Tackling disinformation remains an essential part of NATO's
communication strategies and day-to-day operations, which includes media
monitoring, analysis of the information space and proactive
communication in a coordinated and fact-based manner. Its goal is to
inoculate or "pre-bunk" the mediasphere rather than debunk each false
claim, i.a. through "Setting the Record Straight" narratives and
activities which counter the Kremlin's myths about NATO. In 2019, NATO
adopted an updated and systematic package of appropriate objectives and
measures to combat disinformation. The following year, NATO's Response
to Disinformation on COVID-19 became realised in an Action Plan issued
to Allies by the Secretary General. This document sought to bring
together multiple strands of work on countering hostile disinformation
surrounding COVID-19. In 2021, NATO's Toolbox for Countering Hostile
Information Activities was created; it reflects the Alliance's
twin-track model to respond to hostile information activities:
"understand" and "engage", underpinned by "coordination". The document
aims to provide Allies with a toolbox to assess hostile information
activities, including disinformation, and to assist in determining
possible courses of action. Furthermore, NATO IS staff holds biweekly
briefings on Russian and other disinformation activities at various
relevant committees. Within the Civil Emergency Planning Committee, as
part of a long-term effort, and covering resilience baselines --
spanning across many domains including communications -- Allies share
information about how prepared they are to face various key civil
security challenges, including disinformation. The organisation supports
member and partner states by providing guidance as well as co-financing
for social and scientific projects that strengthen their resilience to
disinformation. **[Rapid-reaction teams have been made available to
member states as part of NATO's strategy to fight hybrid threats. The
organisation is also cooperating more closely with the European Union to
ensure that NATO benefits from the EU's Rapid Alert System set up to
counter disinformation. At the same time, the West has yet to prepare a
coherent, comprehensive and coordinated response to Russian
disinformation.]{.underline}** **[It is up to nations to fully utilise
NATO's potential. A response practice has been developed and seen
partial success within some states and Euro-Atlantic institutions, but
it has not yet been translated into a real common policy or strategy. At
national levels, political declarations and agreed action plans are
still not fully implemented in too many instances.]{.underline}**
Western states approach disinformation in varied ways due to differences
in history, regional security, wealth, education, media quality,
political and legal culture and -- most importantly -- the current state
of their relations with Russia. As a rule, some states prefer bilateral
approaches that safeguard national prerogatives. This may change now
following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Nevertheless, the challenge
of disinformation has begun to attract higher political attention. In
the European Union, this has transpired through the adoption of the
European Democracy Action Plan4 and the presentation of new regulations
on digital services in December 2020. These regulations aim to address
the core issue of the business model developed by disinformation
organisers who instrumentalise social media platforms. The report by the
Special Committee on Foreign Interference in all Democratic Processes in
the EU, including Disinformation (INGE), has also promised that other
means of influence will be addressed5 . In an effort to combat
disinformation, the Digital Services Act (DSA)6 is a breakthrough legal
instrument that will fundamentally change the rules of the game for the
information environment in the European Union, member states and partner
countries; it will also have an impact on national approaches
worldwide.7 The DSA will impose numerous legal obligations on operators
of online platforms that are more demanding than the previous voluntary
commitments outlined in the Code of Practice for Fighting
Disinformation. Companies will be obliged to cooperate with independent
researchers and allow them to access their data. They will also
participate in complaint and appeal procedures regarding content
moderation and dispute resolution. The DSA will provide for the
companies' obligatory consultations, including with civil society
organisations. It will also introduce the institution of trusted whistle
blowers, who, among other things, will notify the companies about
suspected crimes online. The act will correspondingly establish a
European Digital Services Council and advisory body made up of national
digital service coordinators responsible for implementing legislation at
the national level. It will impose specific additional duties on
exceptionally large online platforms with more than fortyfive million
users per month. These obligations will include assessing systemic risks
resulting from their services, identifying actions to reduce such risks,
conducting independent audits, setting appropriate conditions for
algorithmic recommendations of user content and ensuring additional
transparency in advertising (including political ads). Among
international organisations and institutions, the European Union plays a
leading role in counteracting disinformation and introducing new
effective measures against it. The future regulations on transparency in
financing political parties and election campaigns gives hope for
limiting corruption and external influence in the affairs of the member
states.8 NATO and the EU share similar membership compositions and were
created based on comparable value systems, so it is reasonable to assume
that counteracting disinformation will be more prominently reflected in
NATO's new Strategic Concept. A need for this has been suggested by the
authors of the NATO2030 expert group report prepared ahead of the Madrid
Summit in June 20229 . As a result, countering disinformation could be
given a more visible place on the agenda of NATO ministerial meetings
and summits, and more proposals with clear commitments by member states
to tackle disinformation may be unveiled. NATO also has the opportunity
to strengthen the mandates of existing committees to better coordinate
national efforts.

#### Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially increase its security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the areas of biotechnology and artificial intelligence by proposing the designation of the cognitive domain as an operational arena, establishment of a counter-political warfare directorate with an Article 2 mission to coordinate anti-disinformation efforts among NATO member states, and establishment of an alliance-wide disinformation Rapid Response Unit.

## Advantage 1: 2024

#### US is outdated in terms of warfare. We refuse to innovate from Cold War era strategies.

For all its talk of great power competition, **[the US
military]{.underline}**---and the Army in particular---remains poorly
structured to help the United States maintain a decisive advantage in
contemporary strategic competition. This is largely because it [**still
subscribes to a now** outdated understanding of
warfare**.**]{.underline} Losing to a materially inferior nonstate
adversary like the Taliban is one thing, but the Army, as the joint
force's premier capability for strategic competition on land and in the
human domain, is not able to help the United States "win without
fighting," as Sun Tzu put it, against the likes of Russia and China. To
contend with the unique challenges of strategic competition, the Army
needs to think beyond doctrinal updates, techno-centric silver bullets,
and operational quick fixes---it must fundamentally change its strategic
and organizational culture. [**Rather than emphasizing geographic key
terrain, the Army needs to recognize that traditional centers of gravity
have shifted from the power of states and militaries to the**
perceptions of populations**; i**]{.underline}t has to focus on what
Maj. Gen. Robert H. Scales described nearly two decades ago as
"**[capturing the psycho-cultural rather than the geographical high
ground." As the war in Ukraine is reaffirming, war, which is as much
about people as politics, is above all a contest of
wills]{.underline}**. Ultimately, how well the Army learns from its
recent defeats, as well as from its partners in places like Ukraine,
will determine how well it performs in the "infinite game" of strategic
competition. The American Way of War is Outdated Today, the Army remains
fixated on major combat operations and deterring conventional threats as
its organizational identity. This imbalance reflects a limited
understanding of competition, if not of modern war itself---an
undervaluing of psychological factors compared to physical ones,
disregarding Napoleon's dictum that in war moral factors far outweigh
the material. The central problem is that the United States remains
heavily invested in a twentieth-century way of war involving
overwhelming force, firepower, and technological superiority. This core
playbook has remained unchanged since World War II. Despite its first
major strategic failure in Vietnam, the United States again pursued a
strategy in both Iraq and Afghanistan that tried to repurpose forces
designed for short, sharp, force-on-force battles for protracted,
people-centric, irregular warfare and stabilization, with similarly
disappointing results**[. The US military]{.underline}**, in the words
of irregular warfare expert David Kilcullen, has been "excellent at
high-end technical combat but massively [**suck\[s\] at translating
battlefield success into successful** outcomes **outside the narrow,
technological definition of warfare." As a result, it "flounders in the
human domain of conflict," and its "failure to engage with the building
blocks of humanity---culture, society, politics, economics, and
religion---leaves our strategies and plans untethered to
reality."**]{.underline} For decades now, the way to beat the Americans
has been an open secret---go asymmetric, irregular, and indirect.
Attacking this US Achilles' heel subverts both the material and moral
advantages the United States would otherwise enjoy across the
competition continuum. The United States may not like winning without
fighting, but it has also been fighting without winning, repeatedly
failing to achieve political and strategic outcomes while winning
battles and firefights on the ground. The military's demonstrated
inability to "fight and win the nation's wars" has produced what the
Quincy Institute's Andrew Bacevich calls a "yawning gap" between its
reputation and its actual performance. Its failure to win on the ground
has called into question its ability to maintain the confidence of
allies as well as deter adversaries. Many have surmised that the debacle
in Afghanistan emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade
Ukraine, as China and Russia open a new "Great Game" against the West.
The Army's cut-and-paste application of Cold War--era conventional-force
deterrence theory in its concept of competition doesn't help matters,
either. "Traditional deterrence no longer works," observes Sean McFate,
author of The New Rules of War, because US adversaries "wage war but
disguise it as peace." In complex strategic competition, deterrence
works more subtly, situationally, and regionally---and relies more on
economic than military power. Besides, as the Royal United Services
Institute's Peter Roberts has pointed out, "what deters the Kremlin
doesn't necessarily deter Tehran." This implies even more of a premium
on geostrategic and cultural understanding, which must exist long before
a crisis breaks out. Understanding the geostrategic, sociocultural, and
historical context for the war in Ukraine, for example, with its
implications for runaway escalation between nuclear-armed powers, is
even more critical than it was in Iraq or Afghanistan.

#### Russia has shifted the paradigm of 21st century warfare by information operations that have targeted American elections in the past and threaten future elections.

Warfare: The Russian Threat to Election Integrity in the Baltic

AL

[Recent years have seen a cascade of revelations regarding Russian
attempts to interfere with or **disrupt elections** in the West. While
the Russian government's influence]{.underline} campaign [in the 2016 US
presidential election is the most well-known, it was by no means an
isolated incident]{.underline}. **[Western governments are waking up the
threat that Russian]{.underline}** cyber and **[information operations
pose to the integrity of their elections]{.underline}** and the
stability of their domestic politics. However, the question of how to
counter these efforts remains unanswered. The goal of this report is to
offer an answer to two questions: How do we understand the Russian
threat to election integrity? What can governments do to counter such
efforts or mitigate their impact? Our specific focus is on Russian
election interference efforts in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, which
have a long history dealing with and responding to Russian political
interference. By studying the mechanisms through which Russia seeks to
undermine domestic political processes in the Baltic states, we can
better understand the threat that Russia poses. And by analyzing the
policies that the Baltic governments have implemented over the last
three decades, we can better assess the effectiveness of countermeasures
and determine how Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and their Western allies
should counter election interference in the future[.]{.underline} The
[current Western discourse emphasizes two vectors of malign Russian
interference in elections. The first is the cyber vector, through which
Russia uses cyber capabilities to **compromise sensitive election
systems**]{.underline} (and other government networks) with the goal of
[affecting the election outcome. The second is the information vector,
through which Russia injects disinformation, propaganda,
and]{.underline} leaked [or stolen documents]{.underline} into the
domestic political discourse in order [to inflame divisions within a
society,]{.underline} undermine its politics and institutions, and
affect the election outcome. Russian strategy emphasizes the information
vector over the cyber vector[. Russia primarily interferes in the
democratic processes of the Baltic states using information
means,]{.underline} with cyber playing a secondary, enabling role. The
Kremlin considers disinformation and information operations to be the
most effective means of affecting political outcomes in other countries.
Russia seizes on existing domestic political, social, or ethnic
divisions and instrumentalizes them to change how voters think -- and
through that how they vote. We have termed this strategy "cognitive
warfare" -- altering through information means how a target population
thinks, and through that, how they act. Russia has employed a cognitive
warfare strategy in the Baltic states for years. Russian has pushed,
through traditional and social media, narratives designed to divide
ethnic Russians and Russian-speakers from the rest of the society,
undermine domestic political stability, and break the Baltic commitment
to the EU and NATO[. Russia's cognitive warfare efforts have not always
met with success]{.underline} or improved the electoral results of
pro-Russian political forces; [however, the strategy has been consistent
since the Baltic states regained their independence in the]{.underline}
early 19[90s.]{.underline} At present, **[the threat that cognitive
warfare operations pose to election integrity is greater than the threat
posed by Russian cyber capabilities. We assess a low level of risk to
the scenario in which Russia successfully, undetectably compromises
election systems and alters an election outcome in the Baltic
states.]{.underline}** That is not to say the governments of the Baltic
states do not -- or should not -- emphasize cybersecurity
countermeasures. On the contrary, all three Baltic governments have
rightly developed robust cybersecurity protections for their election
systems and implemented monitoring or post-election auditing procedures
to protect against foreign compromise. In our view, the most significant
cyber risk to election integrity derives from inadequate cybersecurity
protections put into place by other politically-relevant actors,
particularly political campaigns, political parties, and media. Russian
hackers regularly target these organizations, stealing sensitive,
private information that the Kremlin later integrates into interference
and influence campaigns in the Baltic states. Rather than posing a
direct threat to election systems, Russian cyber actors more often work
to enable later information operations. What should governments do? We
assess that the approaches taken by the Estonian, Latvian, and
Lithuanian governments to counteract and mitigate the impact of Russian
interference efforts are sound and should continue. Responding to a
cognitive warfare strategy is not merely a technical problem -- it is a
society-wide information challenge, requiring more than simply debunking
fake news or removing fake accounts on Facebook or Twitter. We recommend
that these governments build upon their efforts in several areas: Expand
investments in election cybersecurity; Provide additional resources to
working groups on election security and disinformation; Exercise and
stress-test election-related contingency plans; Deepen sharing of
intelligence, best practices, and lessons learned with allies; Invest in
the monitoring of disinformation and explore regulatory approaches;
Expand integration policies targeting Russian minority populations; and
Craft and promote compelling, unifying national narratives. We believe
that adopting this set of recommendations will enhance the effectiveness
of the Baltic governments in responding to Russian interference in the
short-term and promote greater societal resilience to cognitive warfare
campaigns over the long-term. Other [Western governments can learn from
the experience of the Baltic states]{.underline} as well[. If the
experiences of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are a]{.underline} guide
-- and we believe that they are [-- it is Russia's cognitive warfare
strategy and information operations,]{.underline} not cyber threats[,
that pose the greater **threat to election integrity** on both sides of
the Atlantic]{.underline}. The Kremlin's goal is to undermine Western
elections by interfering with the minds of voters, not our digital
voting systems. Simply improving the security of those systems will not
be sufficient to meet this threat. Russia weaponizes our domestic
political, social, and cultural divisions, turning them against us and
using them to undermine the integrity of our electoral processes.
Western governments should also be clear-eyed in recognizing that
mitigating the impact of Russian political interference campaigns is a
long-term problem. This is the work of decades, not years. Russian
interference is not a problem that can be easily solved; instead,
Western governments will have to manage it for years to come. Just as
cognitive warfare relies on our domestic vulnerabilities to function, so
too will the Russian threat to election integrity not be fully mitigated
as long as those vulnerabilities persist

Vladimir Putin's illegal, aggressive, largescale war on Ukraine is a
horrific reminder of his deep-seated desire to attack and control the
country. The Russian government has been fixated on reasserting control
of Ukraine since the 2014 Maidan Revolution, when Ukrainians took to the
streets to oust Kremlin-friendly dictator Viktor Yanukovych.

[Yet this has also been an overlooked theme of Russian election
interference in the United States, as the authors detail in a new issue
brief for the Atlantic Council]{.underline}. For all the media attention
on the domestic political dimensions, the [Kremlin's interference in the
2016 and 2020 presidential elections (and the 2018 midterms) included a
significant focus on shaping U.S. policy toward Ukraine.]{.underline} As
Putin indicates that he is more willing than ever to use violence to
control Kyiv, American policymakers must prepare now for this influence
effort to reemerge in 2024.

In 2014, Ukrainian citizens organized and mobilized in protest against
the Yanukovych regime, and they used internet technologies to aid in
those efforts---including a EuroMaidan Facebook page and popular Twitter
accounts \@EuroMaydan and \@EuroMaydan_eng (the English-language
version). Putin already viewed opposition movements as illegitimate,
instead believing they must be covertly orchestrated by foreign powers,
and this belief had been hardened by the "color revolutions" that swept
former Soviet republics in the early 2000s. Hence, when Ukrainians
mobilized in 2014, including with the use of Western social media
platforms, the Kremlin saw foreign efforts to undermine its control of
Ukraine.

[**Moscow's burgeoning online disinformation efforts---initially focused
on delegitimizing Russian oppositionists**---turned their sights on the
post-revolution government in Kyiv. The **Russian security** services
created illegitimate "news" outlets to **smear newly elected Ukrainian
president** Petro Poroshenko and his administration, **as well as the
Barack Obama administration** supporting them---foremost, then Vice
President Joseph Biden.]{.underline} For instance, a website called
"South Front," later revealed to be a front for the Russian Federal
Security Service (FSB), ran an opinion article alleging that "the CIA
had its hands all over" the Maidan Revolution. Ukraine served as a
proving ground for tactics Russian intelligence agencies would
eventually deploy to influence elections in the United States.

During the 2016 and 2020 elections, Ukraine was a key theme of Russia's
interference activities[. Numerous Kremlin operatives had ties to
Ukraine or to past Russian interference in Ukraine]{.underline}, such as
Andriy Derkach, a Ukrainian parliamentarian, Russian intelligence agency
academy graduate, and son of Ukraine's onetime intelligence chief.
Derkach took direction from the Kremlin to offer manipulated "evidence"
of corruption between then Vice President Biden and Ukrainian President
Poroshenko. In that vein, some of the disinformation propagated by
Russia's proxy and patronage network fabricated ideas of U.S.-Ukraine
corruption. Even though Derkach and his circle were sanctioned by the
U.S. Treasury Department and exposed for these activities---and despite
Ukrainian authorities debunking these claims---members of Congress and
President Trump himself parroted these narratives.

[American policymakers should prepare now for the likelihood that
Moscow's interference in the 2024 U.S. election will have a considerable
focus on Ukraine.]{.underline} The specifics depend on the next several
months, but the Kremlin will attempt to exploit the situation no matter
the outcome; it will likely be a part of the U.S. election debate.

[To prepare for 2024, Congress and the executive branch must implement
the legislative and regulatory reforms recommended in the Senate review
of 2016 election interference, endorsed on a bipartisan
basis]{.underline}. As it wrote[,]{.underline} "Unclear laws regarding
foreign advocacy, flawed assumptions about what intelligence activity
looks like...and the freedom of expression at the root of our democratic
society became an opportunity for Russian influence to hide in plain
sight." **[Congress should update legislation on foreign espionage,
agents, and lobbying]{.underline}**---most of which is rooted in Cold
Warera thinking---**[to pre-posture for 2024]{.underline}**. In tandem,
the **[U.S. intelligence community should update its cyber and
intelligence tradecraft to account for increased Kremlin
use]{.underline}** of dark money, obscure financial webs, money
laundering, and proxy groups.

Some­times, like a Shakespeare anti­hero confiding in the audience, Donald
Trump blurts out his true motives. This week he did it again. Lawmakers
who want to tweak the Electoral Count Act, accord­ing to Trump, are
essen­tially admit­ting that "[Mike Pence did have the right to change the
outcome. And they now want to take that right away. Unfortunately, he
didn't exer­cise that power. He could have overturned the
election!"]{.underline}

All this came after Trump told a Texas rally that prosecutors
investigating him are "racist" and urged supporters to stage massive,
menacing protests in the cities where he faces legal action.

In a Q&A for Sunday's Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin asked me for the
worst-case scenario for the 2024 election. [The truth is that as bad as
2020 was, it could be worse next time around. Trump's coup try was
clownish, incompetent, chaotic.]{.underline} (Remem­ber the Four Seasons
Total Landscaping? Or hair dye mixed with flop sweat pour­ing down Rudy
Giuliani's face?) [Since then, the **professionals have taken over**.
State legislatures dominated by proponents of the Big Lie have laid the
legal found­a­tion for a genu­ine constitutional crisis in
2024.]{.underline}

How could it happen?

[**Election deniers are running for secretary of state or attorney**
general in many states. The central argument for their candidacy is that
**they would not have certified the 2020 election
results**]{.underline}, as required by law, after voters chose Joe
Biden. If elected[, they **would** not hesitate to try to **block
certification in 2024**.]{.underline} Some are seeking jobs as elections
administrators, where they could use their authority to tilt turnout.
[They **could**, for example, selectively **reject provisional ballots
from communities of color.**]{.underline}

Separately, lawmakers are scheming for the power to nullify elections.
[Some believe (bizarrely) that the Constitution itself gives them the
power to reject elec­tion results.]{.underline} In seven states,
[legislators have proposed bills to form­ally give them­selves that
authority]{.underline}. Fortunately none has passed, and, under any
reasonable reading of the Constitution, those bills would be
unconstitutional. But this disregard for constitutional norms is
alarming and dangerous.

The **smallest [tech­nical dispute could trigger a nullification
attempt.]{.underline}** In 2020, some Wisconsin legislators argued that
the results were invalid because elec­tions offi­cials offered mail-in
ballots to residents of nursing homes without first visit­ing the
facilities, as required by statute. (Of course, the pandemic made such
visits impossible.) A similar technical legal violation [could **serve
as a pretext for a state official to reject future
results.**]{.underline}

And new laws in Arkansas and Georgia recently gave state authorities the
power to remove and tempor­ar­ily replace local elec­tion offi­cials. They
could, for example, remove elec­tion offi­cials in Fulton County, Geor­gia,
on a pretext, install their own candid­ate, and throw out ballots in the
Atlanta area.

Would the Supreme Court step in to protect the sanc­tity of our
elec­tions? The Court declared most recently in 2020 that once a state
legis­lature has decided that voters choose the president, it cannot step
in and undo their votes. That's encour­aging. But in the last decade, the
justices have refused to strike down even a single restrict­ive voting
law. I would prefer not to test their commit­ment to voting rights in a
crisis.

Fixing the Electoral Count Act --- a good idea --- would not stop these
mach­in­a­tions in the states. Far more import­ant would be clear national
stand­ards on things such as vote by mail and when ballots must be
coun­ted. The Free­dom to Vote: John Lewis Act is the most import­ant step
to stop election subversion of all kinds.

**[For the first time, a national leader argues that our demo­cracy is
fake]{.underline}.** Over a year after the elec­tion, **[70 percent of
Repub­lic­ans think Trump really won.]{.underline}** That's new and scary.
But some­thing else --- some­thing more encouraging --- is also happening.
A democracy movement, galvanized by Trump's lies, mobil­ized around the
campaign for federal legis­la­tion. It's the biggest push for voting
rights in half a century --- a coali­tion of breadth, diversity, and
depth. Perhaps the story [of **the next two years will be** **the rising
righteous anger of this movement fight­ing for democracy.**]{.underline}

#### And widespread perception of a Trump victory causes U.S. civil war.

Three **[retired US army generals warned of an insurrection or even
civil war if the results of the 2024 presidential election were not
accepted by some in the military.]{.underline}**

Former Major Gen. Paul Eaton, former Major Gen. Antonio Taguba, and

Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/17/eaton-taguba-anderson-generals-military/) on
Friday.

They wrote that **[they were \"increasingly concerned\" about the 2024
election and the \"potential for lethal chaos inside our
military]{.underline}**.\" The generals highlighted the \"disturbing
number\" of veterans and active-duty members of the military that took
part in the January 6 attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters -- more
than 1 in 10 of those charged had a service record. They outlined **[a
possible situation in which, after the 2024 election, some service
members might pledge loyalty to a \"Trumpian loser\" who refuses to
concede defeat and tries to lead a shadow government. \"Under such a
scenario, it is not outlandish to say a military breakdown could lead to
civil war,\"]{.underline}** they wrote. Since the last election, the
generals warned that even more turmoil and division had emerged in the
armed forces. **[They pointed to recent resistance within the military
towards federal vaccine mandates,]{.underline}** such as a refusal to
comply led by the commander of the [Oklahoma National Guard, Brig. Gen.
Thomas
Mancino.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/11/17/vaccine-mandate-oklahoma-national-guard/)
Mancino claimed that while the Oklahoma Guard is not federally
mobilized, their commander in chief is the Republican governor of the
state and not the president. The generals wrote that they fear if 2024
is a contested election that splits loyalties, there is the \"potential
for a total breakdown of the chain of command along partisan lines.\"
\"The idea of rogue units organizing among themselves to support the
\'rightful\' commander in chief cannot be dismissed,\" they said. The
generals urged that everything must be done to prevent another
insurrection, including holding leaders who inspired the last one to be
held to account. They said there was also work to be done by the
military, such as reviewing how to deal with illegal orders and
undertaking intelligence work to identify and remove potential
mutineers.  The military should also work to identify how misinformation
spreads in the ranks. The generals also suggested that the Defense
Department \"war-game\" possible post-election scenarios to identify
weak spots and put in place \"safeguards.\"

Russia\'s attention hasn\'t just been on Ukraine lately. It\'s been
making diplomatic overtures to countries like Nicaragua, Venezuela,
Cuba, Brazil and Argentina. And last month, a top Russian diplomat said
they wouldn\'t rule out sending military assets to Cuba or Venezuela, a
comment the U.S. State Department dismissed as bluster. Joining us now
to talk about Russia\'s involvement in America\'s neighborhood is
Vladimir Rouvinski, a professor of politics and international relations
at Universidad Icesi in Colombia. Professor, thanks for being here.

VLADIMIR ROUVINSKI: Thank you very much for this invitation.

GONYEA: OK, so Russian President Vladimir Putin has made highly visible
diplomatic overtures to various leaders in Latin America. But I
understand there\'s also been a huge disinformation campaign aimed at
Spanish speakers. Can you explain that?

ROUVINSKI: Yes. First of all, RT in Spanish, which is Russia\'s
government-sponsored TV channel, extended its presence everywhere in
Latin America. I mean, literally, if you go to one or another Latin
American countries and you turn on TV, you will see RT in Spanish
broadcasting to you directly from Moscow. They have the presence
everywhere in Latin America. They have presence in Caribbean, as well.
But it\'s also a high presence on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, which
is especially important now because Russians are telling a lot of things
that are not true, and they expose Latin Americans to this information.

GONYEA: **[Some of the countries that Russia is trying to engage more
with have complicated relationships with the U.S. But others, like
Brazil and Argentina, have historically had much closer ties to the U.S.
So what does Russia stand to gain in places like that]{.underline}**?

ROUVINSKI: This is a very interesting development, and I think it has to
do, on the one hand, with the fact that Latin Americans here are
concerned about what is happening on the international arena. **[The
United States sort of diminished its presence in Latin America, and it
seems that Latin America is no more important for the United States. So
when some of Latin American leaders, like Brazilian President Bolsonaro
or Argentinean President Fernandez, pay a visit to Vladimir Putin, they
try to send a message to Washington saying, look.]{.underline}** We are
still here. We are important. So please pay attention to us.

GONYEA: The Cold War is over, but it does seem like we\'ve been here
before. In the era of the Soviet Union. The Soviets were very involved
in Central America, and then there was that thing known as the Cuban
Missile Crisis when? John F. Kennedy was in office. Is this an echo of
that? Or is this significantly different in many ways?

ROUVINSKI: It is different for several reasons. First of all, Russia
today is not the Soviet Union. Today\'s Russia is much more weaker in
terms of the economy. So they are not prepared to build the same type of
relations like they used to have, for example, with Cuba because Cuba
survived because the Soviet Union was actually supplying all the aid,
all the financing and actually managed the Cuban economy. It was 100%
satellite of the Soviet Union. Today, Russia is not prepared to do this.
So if **[Putin will try to expand its aid - tangible aids to the regimes
like Venezuela, Nicaragua or Cuba, it means that Russia perhaps will be
facing additional problems to its economy, and people will not be happy.
So what Putin is doing instead is making these really strong statements
about potential possibilities for Russia to expand its presence in Latin
America]{.underline}**. But I don\'t see, really, any significant
tangible actions in that sense. So this is very different from the Cold
War time.

GONYEA: I wonder if you could help us understand how this Russian
strategy in Latin America fits into its broader geopolitical ambitions
more generally.

ROUVINSKI: **[For Vladimir Putin and the Russian elites - because it\'s
not only Vladimir Putin, but there are a lot of people in Russia do
share the same vision. They believe that the world should be divided
into spheres of influence]{.underline}**. And for Russia, they say it\'s
kind of natural that Ukraine, Belarus and even Central Asian republics
should belong to the Russian sphere of influence, which in practical
terms mean that if someone like the United States want to establish some
independent policy towards Ukraine or Belarus, they should first consult
Vladimir Putin and ask him for permission. Very similarly, they view
Latin America still as the United States\' sphere of influence. And they
say, well, if you do something in Ukraine, then we go to Latin America,
and we will show you that we also can do something in your sphere of
influence.

#### And Russian disinformation campaigns in Latin America are aimed toward building support for the Ukraine War.

David **Klepper**, 4-1**-2022**, \"Russia aims Ukraine disinformation at

Washington (AP) --- Though Russia is the country that invaded its
neighbor Ukraine, the Kremlin's version relentlessly warns social media
users across Latin America that the U.S. is the bigger problem. "Never
forget who is the real threat to the world," reads a headline,
translated here from Spanish. The article, originally posted in late
February on Twitter by RT en Español, is intended for an audience half a
world away from the fighting in Kyiv and Mariupol. **[As that war rages,
Russia is launching falsehoods into the feeds of
Spanish-]{.underline}**speaking social media users in nations that
already have long records of distrusting the U.S. The aim is to gain
support in those countries for the Kremlin's war and stoke opposition
against America's response. **[Though many of the claims have been
discredited, they're spreading widely in Latin America and helping to
make Kremlin-controlled outlets some of the top Spanish-language sources
for information about the war.]{.underline}** Russian outlet RT en
Español is now the third most shared site on Twitter for
Spanish-language information about Russia's invasion. "RT's success
should be concerning to anyone worried about the success of democracy,"
said Samuel Woolley, a University of Texas professor who researches
disinformation. "**[RT is geared toward authoritarian control and,
depending on the context, nationalism and xenophobia. What we risk is
Russia gaining control of an increasingly large market share of
eyeballs." U.S.-based tech companies have tried to rein in Russian
outlets' ability to spread propaganda following the invasion, by banning
apps linked to the outlets, demoting the content and labeling state-run
media outlets]{.underline}**. The European Union has banned RT and
Russian state-owned Sputnik, **[Yet the content thrives on
Spanish-language websites, message boards and social media pages. While
Russia also creates propaganda in languages including English, Arabic,
French and]{.underline}** German, it's found particular success with
Spanish-speaking users, according to recent research by Esteban Ponce de
Leon, a Bogota, Colombia-based analyst with the Atlantic Council's
Digital Forensic Research Lab, a Washington think tank that receives
funding from the U.S. and other governments. Russia's discredited claims
about Ukraine and the U.S. include allegations that the invasion was
necessary to confront neo-Nazis, or that the U.S. has secretly backed
biological warfare research in Ukraine. In fact, the U.S. has long
publicly provided funding for biological labs in Ukraine that research
pathogens with the hope of curbing dangerous disease outbreaks. That
type of disinformation can easily flow from Latin America into other
countries --- including the U.S. --- that have large Spanish-speaking
communities. Sometimes it's passed between relatives who might be
sharing the claims across continents with one another. It's another
potential entry point for Russia, and a reminder of the sophistication
of the Russians' efforts. 'There's different avenues where RT is
actively engaging communities across Latin America and the United
States," said Jacobo Licona, a researcher at the Democratic firm, Equis
Labs. "That's part of the reason RT has been so effective, they've been
building this network or community ahead of time." As one of the world's
most-spoken languages, Spanish is of obvious interest to any government
or organization intent on shaping global public opinion. But Russia's
focus on the Spanish language goes further, reflecting the historic and
strategic importance of Central and South America during the Cold War,
said analyst Ponce de Leon of the Atlantic Council. For decades, the
Soviet Union sought to exploit historic tensions between the U.S. and
Latin America by supporting communist factions and larger allies
including Cuba. Russia has sought to portray the U.S. as a colonizing
empire, even as the Kremlin has worked to strengthen its own ties to the
hemisphere.

#### **Russian efforts to gain Latin American support directly trades off with American soft power and opens the possibility for Russian military bases.**

Although Russia's efforts to engage Latin America are largely
overshadowed by the U.S. and Chinese presence,
**[Moscow]{.underline}**'s propaganda outlets are **[working to stoke
anti-U.S. sentiment and support populist]{.underline}**
**[figures]{.underline}** in upcoming elections. **[Moscow is
also]{.underline}** **[using its military and commercial ties
to]{.underline}** **[establish a meaningful presence]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** thus **[enhance its image as a global
power]{.underline}**. As Russia-U.S. relations continue to deteriorate,
**[Russia will likely turn to the Western Hemisphere as an important
symbol of its global]{.underline}** **[reach and]{.underline}** to
**[challenge the United States.]{.underline}** Cuba, Nicaragua, and
Venezuela are poised to serve as the cornerstones of this effort but do
not on their own provide enough critical mass to allow Moscow to shape
the region's overall direction. Moscow's reach in Latin America is
limited by its modest resources. Russian military deployments there are
costly and complicated, and Moscow lacks the financial resources to meet
Latin America's need for foreign investment or to serve as an important
market for exports. Yet **[Moscow has been adept at promoting its
presence]{.underline}** at a low cost**[, and it can
sustain]{.underline}** this approach for a long time. When combined with
China's growing role in Latin America, **[this puts U.S. leadership and
dominance at risk.]{.underline}** Over time, Washington faces the
prospect of losing ground with important economic and political allies.
In the political realm, **[Russia is looking to]{.underline}** draw on
its ties with countries in the region to **[promote its international
agenda]{.underline}**. **[Over the past]{.underline}** ten **[years, it
has received]{.underline}** political **[support]{.underline}**
**[from]{.underline}** a handful of countries---**[Bolivia, Cuba,
Nicaragua, and Venezuela]{.underline}**---across a host of issues
important to Russia, such as Georgia, Syria, and Ukraine. Bolivia's
Morales tweeted upon Putin's reelection that it "guarantees geopolitical
equilibrium and world peace before the onslaught of imperialism." In the
economic realm, **[Russia is ready to capitalize on the fallout from
NAFTA renegotiations]{.underline}**, and while it cannot economically
replace the United States as a consumer or an investor, it is well
positioned to respond to Latin American nations' eagerness to diversify
away from what they see as an unreliable, uncooperative United States.
In terms of security, **[the United States faces potential military and
intelligence challenges]{.underline}** if Moscow is able to establish a
greater physical presence in the region. Short of establishing its own
bases, **[Moscow could pursue agreements with key countries that would
provide it with the option of placing its assets and forces in the
United States]{.underline}**' backyard. Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela
have hosted Russian ships in their ports and have engaged in joint
exercises.

#### Latin America is key to successful sanctions on Russia. Russian influence in the region allows them to evade and also opens up the option for forward missile deployment.

**[As the tensions over Ukraine continue to rise between Russia and the
West]{.underline}** (defined by the Kremlin here as the US, NATO and the
EU), **[Moscow has hinted at plans to deploy military forces in Latin
America, specifically in Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua]{.underline}**.
The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Ryabkov, recently
remarked that 'I don't want to confirm anything... or rule anything
out'. **[The Kremlin's thinly veiled threat to send troops (or perhaps
even a more substantial deployment) highlights the importance of
understanding the role played by Latin America in Moscow's
strategy.]{.underline}** **[Such declarations can be interpreted as a
way of setting boundaries for Washington, sending a clear signal on the
need for mutual respect and to refrain from meddling in each other's
respective sphere of influence. If the US continues its expansion in the
former Soviet republics, Russia will respond by increasing its presence
in Washington's own back yard.]{.underline}** Against the backdrop of
rising tensions with the US and the EU, in January 2022 the Russian
government announced it was strengthening strategic cooperation with
Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua 'in all areas'. The Russian Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, communicated that Vladimir Putin had
agreed to reinforce bilateral ties in recent conversations with the
three countries' leaders, citing Russia's 'close relations and strategic
cooperation in all areas: economic, cultural, education and
technical-military'. The rivalry between Russia and the US in their
respective geographic neighbourhoods shares the same underlying dynamic,
based on a strategy of 'supporting resilience'. Since the end of the
Cold War, Washington has cultivated relations with countries in the
post-Soviet space, supporting their sovereignty and independence from
Russia. For its part, Moscow has sought to preserve and increase its
influence among the historic allies of the USSR (Cuba and Nicaragua) and
--much to Washington's chagrin-- has become a fundamental source of
support for the regimes of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and Daniel Ortega
in Nicaragua**[. Even if the Biden Administration believes Russia lacks
the military capacity to follow through on its threats in the
region]{.underline}** (National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has
accused the Kremlin of grandstanding), **[there are nonetheless historic
and modern precedents that mean they must be taken seriously. During the
2008 conflict in Georgia, for the first time, Moscow sent two
nuclear-capable Tu-160 bombers to Venezuela, alongside four warships,
including the nuclear battlecruiser Peter the Great.]{.underline}** This
pattern was repeated in 2013 and again in 2018, when the Russian
government declared its intention to establish an air base on the
Venezuelan island of La Orchilla. In an increasingly globalised and
interconnected world, it is impossible to ignore events on the other
side of the globe, especially when one of the parties involved (in this
case Russia), threatens to deploy troops in Cuba and Venezuela,
alongside other 'technical and military measures'. Going by past
experience, such measures could range from the deployment of military
specialists and technical experts (as has been the case in Venezuela)
through support for new hybrid forms of warfare (including
cyber-attacks) and even the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba,
Venezuela or potentially Nicaragua, mirroring the situation in
Kaliningrad and other border zones. The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962
shows this threat must be taken seriously, even if the Treaty of
Tlatelolco in 1967 sought to avoid a repeat of the crisis by
transforming Latin America into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Moreover,
this is not the only nuclear option available to Moscow: another, less
costly alternative (in financial terms) would be to deploy its Zircon
hypersonic missiles in submarines stationed off the US coast. **[The
spectre of a nuclear deployment in Latin American territory would bring
an end to over half a century of regional consensus on the need to avoid
the presence of nuclear arms.]{.underline}** If there is one lesson that
can be learned from the Cuban Missile Crisis, it is that when two major
powers negotiate to avoid war, the associated allies --voiceless players
like Castro's Cuba-- have no say in the final outcome. Castro was
incensed when he discovered that the USSR had agreed behind his back to
withdraw its missiles in exchange for the US doing likewise Turkey.
However, **[governments in the region should not need the
materialisation of a nuclear threat to spur them into action. They must
stand up and be counted on their immediate concerns, a case in point
being rising energy costs, which --except in producer countries--
increase the burden on families and are forcing governments to increase
fiscal spending via subsidies]{.underline}**. The truth is that a
coordinated regional response is simply not feasible at present, not
only because it would be unprecedented, but also because of the level of
fragmentation and divergence, the broad spectrum of positions on the
crisis, and the preferences of the parties involved.

Familiar faces and emerging powers: China, Russia, Iran, India and
Turkey on the Latin American chessboard

Latin America plays a bit part on the global chessboard. Even if it is
not fully removed from the Ukraine crisis, it nonetheless occupies a
peripheral position. This can primarily be attributed to the paralysis
of the regional integration process, limiting Latin America's presence
on the global stage and preventing it from speaking up with a single
voice in multilateral forums. Let us not forget that the majority of
countries in the region do not have a robust and coherent foreign policy
(Brazil, Chile and Mexico are a few rare exceptions). In general,
foreign policies are focused on regional relations, especially with
neighbouring countries, largely leaving Latin America's international
presence to be scripted by the world's major powers. This was
particularly evident during the Cold War, from the 1950s to the 1980s.
Latin America was a key stage for the conflict between the US and the
USSR (Guatemala in 1954, Cuba since 1959, South America in the 1960s and
Central America in the 1980s) but in the bigger picture the region was
just another battleground in the clash between capitalism and communism.
Its role in this global struggle was driven by historical continuity and
its relations with the various international centres of power. However,
since the 1990s, particularly in the wake of the 2007-08 Financial
Crisis and repeated signs of weakness in the US presence in the region,
powers from outside it have sought to bolster their role and even
challenge US hegemony. The process has been facilitated by the
anti-imperialist and post-colonial policies of the countries of the
Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA, Alianza
Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra América) and its partners. The
consolidation of a multipolar world, particularly in the aftermath of
2008, has had a number of consequences for Latin America. In economic
terms, the region has diversified its markets, allowing China to
consolidate its position as a major trading partner since the start of
the 21st century. In geopolitical terms, some emerging international
players have spotted the opportunity to gain influence, economic power,
prestige and allies at the expense of traditional powers like the US,
the EU and Spain. This gradual erosion of the presence, influence and
reputation of old powers has allowed the rise of new ones (China), as
well as the resurgence of familiar faces (Russia). Beginning in the
first decade of the 21st century, and intensifying in the second, China
and Russia have both expanded their presence in Latin America, alongside
Iran and, to a lesser extent, Turkey. India is also present, with its
own agenda, for now less pronounced but with greater capacity for
expansion in the medium term. Almost all these countries are acting in
support of a multipolar world, challenging US hegemony and trying to
displace it economically, technologically, militarily and commercially.
China's strategy was consolidated under the presidency of Hu Jintao,
when the country produced its first White Book on regional policy. Xi
Jinping has furthered its Latin American projection, presiding over a
quantitative and qualitative leap forward in Beijing's presence in the
region, transforming the Asian Giant into its second trade partner
overall and the main partner of some countries. Despite its limited ties
to Latin America, Turkey has also sought to expand not only its economic
and commercial projection but its political one too. An increasingly
authoritarian President Erdoğan is seeking allies to counterbalance his
isolation on the global stage. El Salvador, which is also opposed to the
US, has made advances to Ankara in search of support for its decision to
make Bitcoin an official currency. Turkey is following the path of Iran,
which has had a strong trade and political presence in the region since
the 1990s, including murky links to terrorist attacks. Iran has become a
key international ally for Venezuela under the presidencies of both Hugo
Chávez and Nicolás Maduro. In January this year, the two countries'
Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Denis Moncada and Hossein
Amir-Abdollahian, agreed in a phone call to strengthen ties between
their governments. Latin America has provided Iran, whose shadow has
hung over the 1994 terrorist attack on the Argentine Israelite Mutual
Association (AMIA, Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina), with space to
break free from its international isolation. A key factor has been its
entente with regimes such as that of Chávez in Venezuela and Ortega in
Nicaragua. Venezuela has signed over 270 agreements with Iran and the
death of Chávez in 2013 prompted Ahmadinejad to label him a messiah. It
is an unlikely alliance, forged in the first decade of the 21st century
between the ultra-conservative regime of the ayatollahs and the
'Bolivarian socialists', grounded in oil and the rejection of US
hegemony. Shared anti-imperialist sentiment has also led to close
relations between the Iranian regime and Bolivia.

Putin's objective: key aspects and methods of the international strategy
of post-soviet Russia

In stark contrast to China, the Kremlin's Latin American policy is
linked to the personality-driven and authoritarian leadership of
Vladimir Putin. Since his rise to power in 1999 and particularly over
the past decade, one of Putin's objectives has been to restore Russia's
status as a global power, lost with the collapse of the USSR. His path
to restore this status has gone beyond his country's immediate
neighbourhood comprising the former Soviet republics to seek out new
strategic niches. The countries of Latin America have offered fertile
ground for this expansion. However, Russia's strategy lacks the
ideological conditioning of the USSR and is more pragmatic in its
approach to diversifying the country's foreign relations. Its roots can
be traced back to the Primakov Doctrine (named after Yevgeny Primakov,
who served first as Foreign Minister and then as Prime Minister between
1996 and 1999). Primakov was highly critical of Boris Yeltsin's idea of
'abandoning' regions like Latin America, where Russia had exerted
significant influence during the Cold War, in favour of closer ties with
the West. His ideas constitute a common thread running through Putin's
'assertive' strategy in Syria, his rapprochement with Beijing and his
support for Maduro and Ortega. **[Russia's influence in Latin America is
different from China's. One of the key factors that explains this
difference is historic precedent]{.underline}**. In some senses, Russia
is the heir to the USSR, whose presence in the region grew during the
Cold War, especially after the Cuban Revolution. Although its behaviour
may have changed --more in form than in substance-- there is nonetheless
a certain continuity. The ideological factor of communism may no longer
be present but other elements remain, such as the geopolitical rivalry
with the US and a longstanding Soviet aspiration to be a world power,
first by the tsars and now by Russia. **[Moscow is using Latin America
to counter US influence in other areas. If Washington seeks to expand
its presence in zones of Russian influence, such as Ukraine, the Kremlin
will increase its military presence in the Caribbean. The region is just
another part of Putin's global strategy. As a revisionist power, Russia
is challenging the idea of a 'unipolar' world, led by the US and backed
by the EU.]{.underline}** Together with NATO, the US and the EU are the
main obstacles to rebuilding Russian influence in its hinterland
(Georgia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan) and restoring its status as a regional
and global power. **[This has led the Kremlin to seek out foreign
partners to build other alliances, both geopolitical, to counter US
hegemony, and economic and commercial, to offset the sanctions imposed
by Washington and Brussels following the crises in
Georgia]{.underline}** (2008) **[and Ukraine]{.underline}** (2014 and
2022). Three main reasons explain why Latin America is important to
Russia: (1) the potential of alliances with Venezuela, Cuba and
Nicaragua to undermine US hegemony; (2) as a tool to allow Putin to
present himself as a global actor (instead of just a local one), using
Latin America as a platform to build a new, multipolar order (for
example, Nicaragua was the first Latin American country to bestow
diplomatic recognition on South Ossetia and Abkhazia following their
separation from Georgia in 2008); and (3) as part of a strategy of
deterrence towards further US advances into Russia's hinterland. The
Ukraine crisis has shown how US imposition in zones that are key to
Russian interests, such as Ukraine, will be met with shows of strength
or threats to do likewise in Latin America. Through its pragmatic,
non-ideological stance, Russia is seeking to expand its presence in
Latin America, strengthening its position in various areas, including
trade, energy and arms sales. The Kremlin initially sought to take
advantage of Bolivarian regional integration initiatives, such as ALBA,
to forge alliances against the US. In 2014 Putin sent a message to the
ALBA summit, expressing his desire to deepen ties and expand 'our
dialogue and practical interaction, both bilaterally and
multilaterally'. However, like Bush's attempts to push the Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA) in 2005, he soon discovered how regional
division, lack of leadership and patchy integration prevent the
achievement of regional goals. Similarly, the paralysis of ALBA
following the loss of Chávez' leadership and Venezuelan petrodollars
laid bare its limitations.

**[The West has struggled to pursue a strategy of coercive diplomacy to
persuade Russia to end its war in Ukraine because most of the conditions
which favor success are not present. However, the prospects for coercive
diplomacy can be revived if Washington and its allies can pursue
smaller, more achievable goals through exploiting the economic and
military costs it has already imposed on Russia]{.underline}**, while
avoiding a wider confrontation with Moscow. Many of the challenges to
coercive diplomacy cannot be addressed because they are inherent or
deep-seated. For example, the type of provocation (a **[fait
accompli]{.underline}** invasion) that undermines coercive diplomacy has
already occurred. Likewise, Russia's advantages in motivation, sense of
urgency, and escalation tolerance (which are inherent to the psychology
and perception of Russia's leader and regime) make coercive diplomacy
more difficult. The West's fear of escalation---another challenge---is
mostly inherent, given Russia's willingness to brandish nuclear threats
as well as public polling against direct intervention. Equally, the West
has little choice but to isolate Putin and treat him as an international
pariah. But this isolation may be exploited in favor of coercive
diplomacy through a negotiated compromise, especially since Putin may
feel an increasing desperation to have something to show for his
adventure. This prospect may have taken on new life with Russia now
downgrading its military goals within Ukraine to focus on the south and
east.[^\[39\]^](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn39)
**[The most promising area for reviving the prospects of coercive
diplomacy concerns the current objectives of the international
anti-Russia coalitio]{.underline}**n. To date, these have been varied,
ambitious, and unrealistic, given Russia's obvious political and
military commitment to the invasion and battlefield prospects that are
still alive (despite significant
losses).[^\[40\]^](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn40) That
situation is now changing. Ukraine's highly effective
resistance---supported and armed by the West---has forced Russia to
reduce its own aims and ambitions. For Ukraine and the West, this
development may be an opportunity to define clearer goals in response to
Russia's retreat---as Zelensky has now started to
do.[^\[41\]^](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn41) Recently,
Western officials have followed the same script, with U.S. Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz calling for an
immediate
ceasefire.[^\[42\]^](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn42)
The most crucial factor in setting diplomatic goals, according to
George, is "that the strength of the opponent's motivation not to comply
is highly dependent on what is demanded of
him."[\[43\]](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn43) In
other words, the greater the demand, the less likely the opponent is to
comply. Hence the choice of objective is crucial: "it affects the
motivation of both sides and the balance of motivation between
them."[\[44\]](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn44) Coercive
diplomacy will be more difficult if the coercer conveys ambitious
objectives that "infringe on vital or very important interests of the
adversary."[\[45\]](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn45) For
example, during the Cuban missile crisis, American demands were limited
to the removal of missiles rather than the Castro regime or the Soviet
presence in Cuba. The temptation for the West to expand their goals as
they see Russia on the back foot will be strong as they appear more
achievable. But this may be misleading. While many increasingly think
Ukraine can win the war, it is also possible that Russia's rot may well
stop in south and east Ukraine as its forces consolidate and refocus on
this smaller
area.[^\[46\]^](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn46) **[Moreover,
broader, longer-term goals---such as weakening Russia---may embolden
Moscow's resistance and jeopardize short-term efforts to end the war
through coercive diplomacy]{.underline}**. Maximalist goals could also
intensify the zero-sum nature of the confrontation between Russia and
the West---another key challenge to successful coercive diplomacy. So to
give coercive diplomacy the best chance, immediate goals should focus on
smaller, more achievable steps, led by Ukraine. More broadly, a return
to focusing on strategic stability as an end in itself---through
conventional and nuclear arms control, robust dialogue on a new security
architecture for Europe, and cooperation on areas of mutual interest
such as international terrorism or nuclear proliferation---would
alleviate to some extent the zero-sum nature of the relationship which
currently dominates. **[The United States and Russia have shown they can
still conduct bilateral diplomacy, despite the war, such as arranging a
prisoner exchange and a call between their defense
ministers.]{.underline}****[[^\[47\]^](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn47) Aiming
for a post-conflict relationship based on stability and pragmatism may
also reveal mutually acceptable outcomes to the
war]{.underline}**.[^\[48\]^](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn48) However,
the gravity of Russian atrocities in Ukraine, the lack of consensus over
Western war aims, and the variety of approaches to dealing with
Putin---contrast Biden labeling him a genocidal war criminal with others
such as French President Emmanuel Macron encouraging restraint for fear
of
escalation[\[49\]](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn49) ---indicates
how difficult this will
be.[^\[50\]^](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn50) Nonetheless,
finding a way to limit the wider Russian-Western confrontation may
increase the chances for coercive diplomacy to stop the war in the short
term**[. The prospects for ending the war on favorable terms for Ukraine
and the West can also be improved by building on Ukraine's success and
Western solidarity to exploit Russia's losses on the battlefield and the
damage to its economy. Much of this simply relies on the West to keep
pursuing this course of action: maintain unity while ratcheting up
sanctions and international pressure on Russia, and support Ukraine
militarily and politically.]{.underline}** This means maintaining the
current trajectory that has already frustrated Russia's war aims and
undermined the viability of a drawn out campaign across Ukraine. This
constant pressure through economic and military attrition may force
Russia into a situation where its imperatives to negotiate or compromise
rise to the fore and the exit ramp becomes more
attractive.[^\[51\]^](https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/reviving-the-prospects-for-coercive-diplomacy-in-ukraine/#_ftn51) Again,
Russia's regional refocus within Ukraine shows this is already happening
to some extent. This provides an opportunity for coercive diplomacy
targeted at a negotiated agreement to end the war---or at least small
steps towards that goal. The challenge will be achieving Ukraine's
stated war aims of returning to the Feb. 23 **[status quo
ante]{.underline}** in spite of the intensifying zero-sum
Russian-Western confrontation.

#### Russia war in Ukraine an ongoing form of structural violence.

**BBC** News 31 May **2022** \"Ukraine reports 15,000 suspected war
crimes,\" https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61652467

Around 15,000 suspected war crimes have been reported in Ukraine since
the war began, with 200 to 300 more reported daily, its chief prosecutor
said. Some 600 suspects have been identified and 80 prosecutions have
begun, Iryna Venediktova told reporters in The Hague. The list of
suspects includes \"top military, politicians and propaganda agents of
Russia\", she added. Russia has denied targeting civilians or
involvement in war crimes.

What is a war crime?

**[Of the 15,000 alleged war crimes, Ms Veneditkova said several
thousand had been identified in the eastern Donbas region - the scene of
fierce fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops.]{.underline}**
Alleged war crimes in the region include the possible forcible transfer
of people - including cases of adults and children - to different parts
of Russia, Ms Venediktova said. **[Torture, the killing of civilians and
the destruction of civilian infrastructure are also suspected war
crimes]{.underline}**, she added. Though investigations relating to the
eastern region have started, Ukrainian authorities do not have access to
Russian-held areas, AFP news agency reports Ms Venediktova as saying.
They were, however, interviewing evacuees and prisoners-of-war, she
added. \"Investigations are very difficult when fighting is going on at
the same time,\" she is quoted as saying by German news agency DPA.
Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia have also joined the investigation efforts,
Ms Venediktova said. Poland and Lithuania were already helping. **[The
International Criminal Court described Ukraine as a \"crime scene\" and
has despatched its largest team of investigators ever to Ukraine to
assist in the investigations]{.underline}**. It said it was also hoping
to open an office in Ukraine\'s capital Kyiv. The announcements came as
two Russian soldiers were jailed for 11 and a half years in Ukraine on
Tuesday for shelling civilian areas. The first Russian soldier to be put
on trial in Ukraine, Sgt Vadim Shishimarin, was sentenced to life in
prison for killing a civilian last week. Ukraine\'s ombudsman for human
rights, Lyudmila Denisova, was also sacked by Ukraine\'s parliament. She
was criticised for not organising humanitarian corridors and
facilitating prisoner exchanges, as well as her handling of alleged rape
cases against Russian soldiers, according to local media reports. Ms
Denisova said she would appeal the decision. On the ground, Ukrainian
and Russian forces battled for control of the eastern city of
Severodonetsk in the Luhansk region.

The city is said to be divided between the two sides - but not equally.
Regional governor Serhiy Haidai said \"70%-80% of the city is controlled
by the Russian army\".

An explosion also reportedly hit a nitric acid container in the city,
which is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Mr Haidai said. He
told the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air following the
explosion, but only in a small area. Russia now occupies almost all of
Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk. Away from
the fighting, European Union leaders reached political agreement to ban
90% of oil imports from Russia, excluding pipeline oil, which Hungary
had opposed. But EU members remain split over Russian gas exports.
Russian oil giant Gazprom also announced it would be cutting gas
supplies to Denmark\'s Orsted, as well as Shell Europe for its supplies
to Germany, after both companies failed to make payments in roubles -
something Russia has demanded.

## Advantage 2: Ukraine Scenario - Poland

#### NATO commitment to Ukraine through cyber and conventional forces strong now.

Pierre **Morcos and** Sean **Monaghan** 3-29-**2022**, \"NATO and the
European Union Show Unity and Resolve in Brussels,\" No Publication,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/nato-and-european-union-show-unity-and-resolve-brussels

**[The leaders of NATO and the European Union met in Brussels last
week,]{.underline}** along with G7 leaders, for an extraordinary trio of
summits one month after Vladimir Putin began his invasion of Ukraine.
While Russia continued its devastating assault across Ukraine, leaders
from Europe, North America, and Japan reinforced their united front
against Moscow's war of aggression, repeating demands for Russia to end
the conflict and withdraw its forces from Ukraine while increasing the
economic and international pressure against the Kremlin.
**[They]{.underline}** also **[stood firm with the people of Ukraine,
committing to further economic, humanitarian, and military support.  On
economic sanctions, leaders focused on fully implementing existing
sanctions against Russia and Belarus, with the United Kingdom
adding [new targeted
sanctions](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/foreign-secretary-announces-65-new-russian-sanctions-to-cut-off-vital-industries-fuelling-putins-war-machine)]{.underline}**.
The European Union, NATO, and G7 all
announced [new measures](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/55082/2022-03-2425-euco-conclusions-en.pdf) to
"close loopholes and target actual and possible circumvention." NATO
called
specifically [on China](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_193719.htm) "to
abstain from supporting Russia's war effort in any way, and to refrain
from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions." The EU-China
summit at the end of this week provides another opportunity to make this
point. Energy security was prominent, with European nations doubling
down on
their [pledge](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1511) to
reduce reliance on Russian fossil fuels, adding
to [previous commitments](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-phase-out-russian-oil-imports) by
the United Kingdom and the United States to phase out Russian oil
imports this year. EU leaders accelerated their [energy
divorce](https://www.csis.org/analysis/europe-russia-energy-divorce-begins) with
Russia, assisted by the United States, which will send more natural gas
to Europe. However, with some nations more reliant than others on
Russian energy sources and domestic consumers increasingly affected,
energy politics may be the biggest test of Europe's unity and resolve in
the coming weeks and months. On the humanitarian front, the European
Union is
directly [supporting](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_22_2020) Ukraine
and its neighbors, which already host 3.5 million Ukrainian refugees.
Washington [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/24/us/ukrainian-refugees-biden.html) \$1
billion in new humanitarian aid and will admit 100,000 Ukrainians
fleeing the war. As the dire siege of the city of Mariupol continued,
President
Macron [announced](https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-france-spearhead-exceptional-operation-evacuate-mariupol/) that
France, together with Turkey and Greece, was planning an "exceptional
humanitarian operation" to evacuate civilians. With a major food crisis
looming, France also launched---in its role as current chair of the
Council of the European Union---an international [food security
plan](https://www.rfi.fr/en/international/20220325-france-proposes-food-security-crisis-plan-to-avoid-famine-stoked-by-ukraine-war-africa-egypt-wheat) with
the African Union to avert famines in vulnerable countries dependent on
Russian and Ukrainian crops.In providing military support to Ukraine,
NATO and the European Union continue to walk the tightrope between
helping Ukraine defend itself and avoiding escalation into a direct
conflict with Russia. **[NATO
allies [committed](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_193613.htm?selectedLocale=en) to
provide Ukraine with more defensive weapons, plus new "cybersecurity
assistance" and "equipment to help Ukraine protect against biological,
chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats."]{.underline}** The
European
Union [agreed](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/03/23/eu-support-to-ukraine-council-doubles-funding-under-the-european-peace-facility/) to double its
support to the Ukrainian Armed Forces through the European Peace
Facility to €1 billion**[. Beyond their immediate assistance to Ukraine,
NATO and the European Union are revising their military plans to deal
with a more intense and persistent period of confrontation with
Russia. In the short term, NATO
has [established](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_193719.htm) four
new multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and
Slovakia---adding to its four existing missions in Poland and the three
Baltic states, which have also been bolstered]{.underline}**. There are
now 40,000 forces from all allies under the direct command of NATO,
concentrated in Eastern Europe. These are supported by air and naval
forces positioned from the High North to the Mediterranean Sea,
including an unprecedented five carrier strike groups. In the longer
term, NATO leaders looked
to [reset](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_193719.htm?selectedLocale=en%22%20\h%20%20HYPERLINK%20%22https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_193671.htm) their
collective defense and deterrence, stating, "We will now accelerate
NATO's transformation for a more dangerous strategic reality, including
through the adoption of the next Strategic Concept in Madrid." In the
days before its summit, the European Union also adopted its first
defense and security concept, named the "[Strategic
Compass](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/03/21/a-strategic-compass-for-a-stronger-eu-security-and-defence-in-the-next-decade/),"
designed to "make the EU a stronger and more capable security
provider."  **[Last week's summits demonstrated once again the unity and
resolve shown by the nations of NATO and the European Union in the face
of Russia's challenge to Ukrainian sovereignty and European security. As
a [new
phase](https://warontherocks.com/2022/03/a-new-phase-of-the-russo-ukrainian-war-begins/) of
the war begins, NATO and the European Union will need to keep this
momentum while addressing the many long-term aftershocks of the conflict
on the humanitarian, energy, food, and defense fronts.]{.underline}**
With this in mind, the road to NATO's summit in Madrid at the end of
June will be critically important.

#### Ukrainian refugees and historical animosity between Poland and Ukraine are a unique target for Russian disinformation campaigns.

Vanessa **Gera** 4-10-**2022,** \"Poland-Ukraine ties seen as target of
Russian disinformation,\" ABC News,
https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/poland-ukraine-ties-target-russian-disinformation-83992663

WARSAW, Poland \-- Days before Poland's [Independence
Day](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/FourthOfJuly) in November, vandals
painted the blue-and-yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag on monuments in
Krakow. The vandalism, which took place as Russia massed troops near
Ukraine's border, looked as if Ukrainians were defacing memorials to
Polish national heroes.

Yet some clues suggested otherwise.

The flag\'s colors were reversed, with the yellow on top of the blue and
one offensive message was in an unnatural mix of Russian and Ukrainian.
Though prosecutors are still investigating, Polish and Ukrainian
authorities believe it was most likely a Russian-inspired attempt to
trigger ethnic hostility between Ukrainians and Poles.

Polish and Ukrainian authorities have for years accused Russia of trying
to provoke hostility between their neighboring nations as part of a
broader effort to divide and destabilize the West --- and the concerns
have gained greater urgency since Russia invaded Ukraine. **[Poland and
Ukraine are neighbors and allies but they share a difficult history of
oppression and bloodshed, and those historical traumas sometimes rise to
the surface. Poland has also accepted large numbers of Ukrainian
refugees, creating fears that could become another wedge issue that
Russia could exploit.]{.underline}**

**["The Russian efforts to sow divisions between the Poles and
Ukrainians, particularly by means of exploiting historical issues, are
as old as time," said Stanislaw Zaryn, the spokesman for Poland's
security services.]{.underline}** "**[Russia has redoubled them since
the war began," he said. "And they are more dangerous now because the
war is going on and it can affect more people than
before.\"]{.underline}** Reacting to the November incident, the
Ukrainian Embassy in Warsaw immediately denounced it as "shameful" and
"a provocation aimed at harming the good neighborly relations between
Ukraine and Poland."

**[More than 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Poland since
the war began, and while some move on to other countries more than half
have remained. Poles have reacted with an outpouring of help and
goodwill and the government has extended to the Ukrainians the same
rights to education and health care that Poles have.]{.underline}**
Never Again, an anti-racism association in Poland, has documented
several attempts to stoke aversion to the Ukrainian refugees and even to
openly justify Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion. In some
cases those behind the messages are far-right Polish activists or
politicians with pro-Kremlin views, according to a report the
organization published Thursday. "These groups do not enjoy widespread
public support, but they do their best to make Poles and Ukrainians
quarrel, spread hateful content, conspiracy theories and false
information, primarily in the internet space," it said. Larysa Lacko,
**[an expert on countering disinformation at NATO, said Russia is known
to exploit refugees as a wedge issue because it touches on the economy,
race and other sensitive issues, and that she has also observed Russian
"disinformation talking about historical grievances."]{.underline}**

#### But Poland is key to containing the Ukraine war. 

**The Economist 12 March 2022**, \"Why Poland has become NATO's linchpin
in the war in Ukraine,\"
https://www.economist.com/europe/poland-will-play-an-outsized-role-in-western-efforts-to-assist-ukraine/21808064

Polish leaders have long pushed their partners in nato and the eu to
forge closer ties with Ukraine, warning of the risk of Russian
aggression, only to be dismissed as paranoid. Russia's murderous and
unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has proven them entirely right. **[Polish
denunciations of Russia's imperial ambitions, which Americans and
western Europeans once pooh-poohed as post-communist stress disorder,
have now become standard nato talking points. But it is not just
Poland's view of Russia that is being taken more seriously; it is
Poland's role in the world. In a matter of a few weeks, the country has
become the linchpin of the Western effort to defend Ukraine and deter
Russia, a task as important as it is dangerous. Hundreds of Stinger
missiles, Javelin anti-tank weapons and other munitions have already
poured into Ukraine through Poland and Romania, part of America's \$350m
package to assist the besieged country]{.underline}**. **[Poland itself
has dispatched an ammunition convoy to Ukraine, and plans to send
mortars, small drones and man-portable missile systems, known
as manpads, from its own supplies. Weapons deliveries from other
countries]{.underline}**, including a €450m (\$490m) consignment
financed by the eu, **[are on the way, too]{.underline}**. "The biggest
share of military equipment, both lethal and non-lethal, will go through
Poland," says Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, a military-analysis
firm. "Like it or not," says Stanislaw Koziej, a former
brigadier-general in Poland's army, "we are going to be the main link in
the chain connecting Ukraine and the West." **[Poland is nearer the eye
of the storm than any other nato member. It risks being drawn in
further]{.underline}**. For days the country mooted giving its mig-29
fighter jets to Ukraine in exchange for f-16s from America. The
Americans, who initially pushed the plan, balked when Poland asked to
send the jets via an American airbase in Germany. On March 9th they
backed out, saying transferring the jets risked escalation. Poland wants
to do as much as possible, say officials in Warsaw, without being
dragged into the war. **[The crisis has also turned Poland, almost
overnight, into the country with the second-largest refugee population
in Europe. At least 2m people have escaped Ukraine since the start of
the invasion, the most extensive and rapid movement
of [refugees](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/05/a-new-refugee-crisis-has-come-to-europe) in
Europe's post-war history. Over 1.3m have reached Poland. The country
has coped remarkably well with the influx. But its resources are
stretched.]{.underline}** Poland was already home to Europe's largest
Ukrainian diaspora, over a million strong, and so is an important
recruiting ground for Ukraine's resistance. In the first ten days of the
war, Polish border guards recorded 217,000 crossings into Ukraine. A
large share were Ukrainians heading back home to fight. "Our people are
waiting," says Aleksandr, who arrived at the border by bus from Estonia.
"They're going to tell us what to do, give us ammunition and guns, and
then we're off to work." **[Poland's size, location and infrastructure
make it the West's most important gateway to Ukraine. The two countries
share a 530km]{.underline}** (330-mile) **[border,]{.underline}**
punctuated by over a dozen crossings. The airport in Rzeszow, about an
hour's drive from the border, is the closest big airport to Ukraine
on nato territory. Flight radar data show an uptick in military
aircraft, almost certainly involved in weapons deliveries, flying in and
out of Rzeszow since the start of the war. Were Kyiv to fall to the
Russians, which is still far from guaranteed, Ukrainian troops and
volunteers would probably regroup in the west of the country, in or
around Lviv, only 80km from the Polish border. This would further raise
Poland's importance for Ukraine. The war has already strengthened
Poland's position in nato. The alliance is increasing its presence in
Poland dramatically. America had deployed nearly 5,000 new troops to
Poland in February, even before the Russian invasion, bringing the total
to some 9,000. It also recently approved the sale to Poland of 250
Abrams tanks. Poland also hopes to reconcile with the rest of the eu.
The bloc has repeatedly chided Poland's nationalist government for
stacking its top court with cronies, threatening judges who rule against
it and harassing the media. The stand-off prompted the eu to freeze
€36bn in pandemic recovery funds earmarked for Poland and to fine it for
ignoring rulings by the European Court of Justice. Poland has moved to
meet some eu demands, and its efforts in the face of Russia's aggression
may earn it a more sympathetic hearing. But there are incalculable risks
involved, too. **[Analysts say Russian retaliation of one kind or
another against Poland is a near certainty. The longer the war lasts,
the more desperate Russia will be to destroy the supply lines connecting
Poland to Ukraine.]{.underline}** "I'm afraid that Russian rocket
attacks against those supply lines are something we have to take into
account in the coming days and weeks," says Wojciech Kononczuk of the
Centre for Eastern Studies, a think-tank in Warsaw. America clearly
takes the possibility seriously: it is sending Patriot missile-defence
batteries to Poland. Others mention the threat of Russian sabotage and
cyberattacks inside Poland. A social-media monitoring group has already
uncovered a Russian disinformation campaign intended to spread panic and
drive up resentment towards refugees from Ukraine. Vladimir Putin's
threats against countries that interfere in Ukraine are not to be taken
lightly. But for Poland and nato, the only risk bigger than that of
Russian retaliation is the risk of Western inaction. "There's no
alternative, because we're in the same boat," says Mr Kononczuk. "The
only difference is that Ukraine's in the front, and we're in the back."

#### Without Polish support, war in Ukraine spills out into Western Europe

**Michael Baranowski 3-16-2022**, \"Secure NATO's Borders Before Putin's
War Spills Over,\" GMFUS,
https://www.gmfus.org/news/secure-natos-borders-putins-war-spills-over

Viewed from Warsaw, Russia's war in Ukraine is getting closer to our
borders.

President Vladimir Putin, frustrated with the slow progress of his land
operation and heavy losses, is indiscriminately destroying cities and
killing civilians. **[Russia bombed a military base barely ten miles
from the Polish border over the weekend, sparking fears that the war may
soon spill onto NATO territory. At the same time, Russia threatened to
target convoys with Western weaponry coming across the border from
Poland to Ukraine. These actions are meant as a warning to
NATO]{.underline}**: "Keep out!" The alliance should do no such thing.
Now is the time to prepare for the possibility that this war enters NATO
territory, and today's meeting of NATO's ministers of defense is the
perfect opportunity to do so. In recent weeks, the United States doubled
its troop numbers in Poland from 5,000 to 10,000 and delivered two
batteries of anti-missile Patriot systems. Other allies buttressed the
Baltic states and Romania with additional soldiers. And NATO activated
its response force and their contingency plans, granting the Supreme
Allied Commander Europe greater flexibility to act in an emergency.
**[NATO has already reinforced its eastern members. But more must be
done to ensure our security and deter Russia from expanding this
conflict.]{.underline}** Placing two Patriot batteries in Poland is a
good beginning, but they cannot cover the entire length of Poland's
border with Ukraine---or Romania's, or Slovakia's. The alliance's force
posture in the northeastern flank is a real problem. Belarusian
territory has become de facto Russian military space. That means that
the Baltic states are surrounded by Russia to the south and east, and
only the narrow "Suwalki Gap" corridor between Poland and Lithuania
connects them to the rest of NATO territory. Poland now has over 700
miles of border vulnerable to Russian military operations. And Russia's
military is ready. The most militarized corner of Europe is Kaliningrad,
a Russian region bordering Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus, where 30,000
troops and 300 tanks sit ready to reach Poland, the Baltic states, and
Germany. Since the Russian build-up for this war started, Russia placed
an additional 30,000 troops in Belarus and brought a force of 190,000 to
fight the war in Ukraine itself. Even this brief overview shows that
NATO's current reinforcements do not begin to address the existing
imbalance in military power. **[NATO needs to correct this imbalance,
and its members' defense ministers should consider the following at
today's meeting: how best to support Ukraine militarily in the war
against an aggressive Russia; how to immediately shore up the
air-and-missile defenses of frontline states; and how to begin to change
NATO's force posture on the eastern flank. Given that Putin already
crossed many "uncrossable" lines, the alliance must now move from a
force posture that relies on "deterrence by presence" to "deterrence by
defense]{.underline}**." There is a long way to go to get there.

#### Broader Western Europe war collapses the current world order. 

Robin **Wright 3-10-2022**, \"The Growing Fear of a Wider War Between
Russia and the West,\" New Yorker,
https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-growing-fear-of-a-wider-war-between-russia-and-the-west

Since Russia's invasion, the besieged Ukrainian President, [Volodymyr
Zelensky](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/03/14/volodymyr-zelensky-leads-the-defense-of-ukraine-with-his-voice),
has repeatedly warned the West about the danger that Putin would target
other European nations. "Everyone thinks that we are far away from
America or Canada. No, we are in this zone of freedom," [Zelensky
said](https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-putin-news-03-08-22/h_6bc0265765f5a9e14f0ab124e1cc906b) in
a television interview, on Monday. "And, when the limits of rights and
freedoms are being violated and stepped on, then you have to protect us.
Because we will come first. You will come second. Because, the more this
beast will eat, he wants more, more, and more." The U.S., however,
pushed back this week on key military requests
from [Ukraine](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ukraine), for fear of
Russia's reaction. Putin's reckless offensive has forced the U.S. to
adopt awkward policy positions. On March 5th, Zelensky [made an
impassioned
appeal](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/05/zelenskyy-plea-congress-aid-00014419) to
members of the House and Senate for more military aid, notably help in
obtaining Soviet-era warplanes that Ukrainian pilots are trained to fly
and that could balance Russia's air superiority. On Wednesday, the
Pentagon rejected an offer from Poland to turn over twenty-eight MIG-29
fighter jets to U.S. custody---flying them to a base in Germany---for
transfer to Ukraine. U.S. intelligence officials assessed that an
American role in a transfer "may be mistaken as escalatory and could
result in significant Russian reaction that might increase the prospects
of a military escalation with ***[[nato]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}***,"
the Pentagon spokesman, John Kirby, [told
reporters](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2961705/us-doesnt-want-warfare-in-ukraine-to-escalate-says-dod-official/).
U.S. involvement was deemed to be "high risk." The majority of Ukraine's
warplanes are still intact, a senior Defense Department official added,
while acknowledging that Russia's surface-to-air missiles now have an
"umbrella" that covers virtually all of Ukraine. The Administration
cited the same fears about Zelensky's request for help
from ***[[nato]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}*** in establishing a no-fly
zone over part of Ukraine to protect civilians. "We also have to see to
it that this war does not expand," [Blinken
said](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-uk-foreign-secretary-elizabeth-truss-at-a-joint-press-availability) on
Wednesday, at a joint press conference with his British counterpart.
"Our goal is to end the war, not to expand it, including potentially
expand it to ***[[nato]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}*** territory."
Otherwise, he warned, "it's going to turn even deadlier, involve more
people, and I think potentially even make things harder to resolve in
Ukraine itself." On Thursday, Avril Haines, the director of National
Intelligence, acknowledged that the U.S. is now in a uniquely
challenging position. "We are obviously providing enormous amounts of
support to the Ukrainians, as we should and need to do," she told the
Senate Intelligence Committee. "But at the same time trying not to
escalate the conflict into a
full-on ***[[nato]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}*** or U.S. war with Russia.
And that's a challenging space to manage." Yet, at each of his four
stops in ***[[nato]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}*** countries near Russia,
Blinken heard dire predictions about the broader Russian threat beyond
Ukraine---and the need for the U.S. to do more. In Riga, on Monday, the
Latvian Foreign Minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs, [lamented to
Blinken](https://www.state.gov/secretary-of-state-antony-j-blinken-and-latvian-foreign-minister-edgars-rinkevics-at-a-joint-press-availability/),
"We have no illusions about Putin's Russia anymore." In Vilnius, the
Lithuanian President, Gitanas Nauseda, turned to Blinken
and [said](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-lithuanian-president-gitanas-nauseda-before-their-meeting/),
"Deterrence is no longer enough. We need more defense here, because
otherwise it will be too late here, Mr. Secretary. Putin will not stop
in Ukraine; he will not stop." And in Tallinn, on Tuesday, the Estonian
Prime Minister, Kaja
Kallas, [said](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-and-estonian-prime-minister-kaja-kallas-at-a-joint-press-availability/) that ***[[nato]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}*** countries
"need to adapt to the new reality" of a "very aggressive Russia" and
permanently strengthen their defenses in the air, on land, and at sea.
Pressed on what specifically countries on Russia's borders needed, she
replied, "Everything." **[Eastern European countries---notably those
once allied with, or part of, the former Soviet Union's empire---have
long warned of the potential for Russian aggression]{.underline}**. "We,
the Poles, are already tired of reminding everyone: 'We told ya so,' "
Marek Magierowski, Poland's Ambassador to the U.S., told me in an
interview this week. He cited the forewarning by the late Polish
President Lech Kaczynski during the Russian invasion of Georgia, in
2008. "Today Georgia, tomorrow Ukraine, the day after tomorrow---the
Baltic states and later, perhaps, time will come for my country,
Poland," Kaczynski had said. Magierowski added, "We have never had any
doubts whatsoever about Vladimir Putin's neo-imperial ambitions."
**[Putin has been waiting for this "window of opportunity" for years, he
said. "He convinced himself that the West is weak, divided, wallowing in
a decadent mood]{.underline}**. He thought the free world wouldn't care
about Ukraine's fate, as it didn't care about Czechoslovakia's in 1938,"
when Europe tolerated Nazi Germany's annexation of the Sudetenland.
**[Putin]{.underline}**, he told me, **[is similarly "emboldened"
because the West was "tragically lenient" and "outrageously complacent"
after Russia [murdered the defector Alexander
Litvinenko](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/01/29/kremlin-inc),
in 2006; [invaded and annexed
Crimea](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-creeping-annexation-of-crimea)]{.underline}**,
in 2014; [helped destroy the Syrian city of
Aleppo](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-battle-for-aleppo-syrias-stalingrad-ends),
in 2016; reportedly used chemical weapons to [poison the former spy
Sergei
Skripal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/sergei-skripal-russia-and-the-salisbury-conundrum) and
his daughter, in 2018; and poisoned the opposition leader [Alexey
Navalny](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/alexey-navalny), in 2020. Over
the past three decades, Eastern Europeans have often encountered
skepticism of their view of Putin as the U.S. and Western Europeans,
notably the former German Chancellor [Angela
Merkel](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/angela-merkel-leaves-politics-on-her-own-terms),
advocated dealing pragmatically with Russia.

During his European trip, Blinken repeatedly promised
that ***[[nato]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}***, this time, would prevent
further Russian expansion. "We will defend every inch
of ***[[nato]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}*** territory with the full force
of our collective power," he vowed, in Estonia. But U.S. **[experts
worry, too, about an unintended incident triggering a wider war, like
the spark that ignited the First World War, a conflict that dragged on
for four years and killed tens of millions. Russia's invasion of Ukraine
"could easily escalate into a larger conflict stretching from the Baltic
to the Black Sea and further west into Europe,]{.underline}**" Thomas E.
Graham, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, [warned in a new
report](https://www.cfr.org/report/preventing-wider-european-conflict) issued
on Tuesday. It might not matter what the U.S. does, he wrote. Crippling
sanctions "could provoke Putin to lash out with greater violence,"
Graham cautioned. But, [**if ***[nato]{.smallcaps}*** appeared
restrained, Moscow could be "tempted to press militarily even further
into Europe" to enlarge its sphere of influence. The rippling impact of
broader Russian aggression would stress "the geopolitical, economic, and
institutional foundations" of the international order created after the
Second World War,**]{.underline} Graham wrote. Given the Russian
leader's history, Angela Stent, a former National Intelligence officer
and the author of "[Putin's World: Russia Against the West and with the
Rest](https://www.amazon.com/Putins-World-Russia-Against-West/dp/1455533025),"
is worried about a miscalculation. "[**The concern we have to have
immediately is that the war in Ukraine doesn't inadvertently spread to
Poland or Romania by some unforeseen clash, which would then have to
involve ***[nato]{.smallcaps}*** in a war with Russia,"**]{.underline}
she told me. Stent also worries about Putin's intentions short of war.
"You can use nonmilitary means to disrupt societies. And he's already
been doing that for the past couple of decades." As the Russian leader
grows increasingly cornered, she added, he will seek to exploit popular
sentiment in countries like Serbia, where a pro-Russia march to support
the war was held last week. The new U.S. intelligence assessment warns
that Russia will employ "an array of tools" to undermine the interests
of the U.S. and its ***[[nato]{.underline}]{.smallcaps}*** allies. "We
expect Moscow to insert itself into crises" whenever it sees an
opportunity, it concludes. On Wednesday, the Biden
Administration [issued a forceful
denial](https://www.state.gov/the-kremlins-allegations-of-chemical-and-biological-weapons-laboratories-in-ukraine/) after
Russia's bizarre claim that the U.S. and Ukraine were developing
chemical and biological weapons. The State Department spokesperson, Ned
Price, said that Moscow has a long track record of accusing the U.S. of
the very crimes that Russia is perpetrating. These tactics are "an
obvious ploy" by Russia to try to justify "further premeditated,
unprovoked, and unjustified attacks," he said. Russia, as the aggressor,
still has the upper hand. But, for the U.S. and its allies, the one
positive sign is that the performance of the Ukrainian military has
exceeded expectations. Russian forces have fallen far short of Putin's
goal of a swift seizure of Kyiv and the ouster of Zelensky's government.
The first two weeks have, instead, been grinding for Moscow. U.S.
intelligence estimates that between two thousand and four thousand
troops fighting for Russia---not all of them Russian---have died in the
first two weeks. The bravery of Ukrainians, so far, has prevented the
worst-case scenario.

[Forging common approaches among NATO allies and partners on political
warfare is no easy task]{.underline}. Political warfare is a complex
beast; by design it is hard to notice, identify, call out, and grapple
with. There is a reason that allies and partners, for now, have largely
approached political warfare as distinct issues---including
disinformation, election interference, political coercion, and economic
pressure---with varying degrees of effort and success. It is challenging
to put our heads around the entirety of the problem set. Nevertheless,
the very nature of the problem is that it is cross-cutting, interlinked
with other types of warfare and tools, and that it plays out and pulls
levers in multiple actors' jurisdictions. For that reason, and for NATO
to really grapple with political warfare---to achieve deterrence,
mitigation, management of the effects, and to mute the impact---it must
tackle the whole, holistically and comprehensively. It is helpful that
NATO has both an Article 2 Washington Treaty strategic mandate and
operational experience and lessons learned to help allies and partners
grapple with these challenges. Indeed[, NATO has tackled multi-sector,
multi-actor problems before; its prior Comprehensive Approach in
Afghanistan and Iraq provides a robust framework to forge a collective
and effective response to political warfare]{.underline}. [A
Comprehensive Approach 2.0 would enable NATO to bring together multiple
layers of actors, including government agencies]{.underline} (defense,
foreign affairs, treasury, homeland security, law enforcement, etc.);
[the public, civil society, and private sector actors]{.underline}; NATO
member states and partner nations; and different multinational
institutions like the EU and the UN. [Such groups can work to forge a
multi-vector approach to threat assessments of, consensus building on,
and coordinating responses to Russian, Chinese, and other authoritarian
political warfare.]{.underline} Partners across multiple countries and
sectors are critical to the success of a Comprehensive Approach 2.0 and
enable NATO to extend its understanding, situational awareness, and
learn best practices from others. [The urgency of this problem should
not be understated]{.underline}. [While NATO allies and partners are
coming to grips with aspects of Russian and Chinese political warfare
tactics, they have fallen behind and remain on the back foot in
effectively responding to this challenge]{.underline}. [NATO is still
not far enough along in recognizing threats in existing and emerging
areas]{.underline} like predatory economic practices and subversive
energy investments. Allies and partners' approaches to hybrid warfare,
while laudable for their developments in some areas of disinformation
and cyber defense, have overall been insufficient to match the evolution
of the threat landscape. NATO's current approaches to hybrid warfare can
be stiflingly broad, preventing effective tailoring of strategies to
match the threat. There is still an overreliance on NATO's military arm
and a lack of focus and intent on how to employ its political toolkit
and nonmilitary competencies. [Ultimately, a strategic shift is needed
within NATO for the Alliance to play a more advanced role in countering
political warfare]{.underline}, enabled by its Article 2 mandate. A
utilization of NATO's nonmilitary actors, toolkit, and responses will
enable a more nimble and effective Alliance posture to the political
warfare side of the hybrid spectrum. As China, Russia, and other
authoritarian actors seek to thwart international institutions from
within and undermine them from the outside, this is an urgent problem.
Mitigating political warfare over the next decade will be critical to
upholding the value and integrity of the very institutional
underpinnings that provide security for transatlantic peoples. It is the
only way for NATO to avoid the sad fate of the orb spider and build
resilience against the coopting and subversion of the liberal world
order upon which our shared security relies. In other words, [NATO must
protect the transatlantic web.]{.underline} NATO has managed challenges
like this before. With the right strategic focus and approach it can
more effectively counter political warfare and forge a more secure
future for like-minded allies and partners.

#### AI is key

Counter-Disinformation Framework,\" No Publication,
https://www.rand.org/blog/2021/03/towards-an-ai-based-counter-disinformation-framework.html

Though the majority of malign information on social media is spread by
relatively simple bot technology, [[existing
evidence]{.underline}](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/01/08/130983/were-fighting-fake-news-ai-bots-by-using-more-ai-thats-a-mistake/) suggests
that AI is being leveraged for more sophisticated online manipulation
techniques. The extent of the use of AI in this context is difficult to
measure, but many information
security [[experts ]{.underline}](https://gizmodo.com/hackers-have-already-started-to-weaponize-artificial-in-1797688425)believe
**[that AI is already being leveraged by malign actors, for example to
better determine attack parameters]{.underline}** (e.g., \'what to
attack, who to attack, \[and\] when to attack\'). This enables more
targeted attacks and thus more effective information threats, including
disinformation campaigns. **[Recent advances in AI techniques such
as [Natural Language Processing (NLP)
(PDF)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf) have also given rise to
concerns that AI may be used to create more authentic synthetic
text]{.underline}** (e.g., fake social media posts, articles, and
documents).
Moreover, [[Deepfakes ]{.underline}](https://cset.georgetown.edu/research/deepfakes-a-grounded-threat-assessment/)(i.e.,
the leveraging of AI to create highly authentic and realistic
manipulated audio-visual material) represent a prominent example of
image-based AI-enabled information threat. **[AI also provides various
opportunities for strengthening responses to increasingly sophisticated
and democratised disinformation threats. Aside from [increased

which AI models can detect pieces of false or misleading information or
recognise
the [tactics](https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/using-machine-learning-to-detect-malign-information-efforts.html) used
by social media bots in spreading disinformation]{.underline}** (e.g.,
the rhetorical tools they adopt), **[AI models also represent
more [cost-effective](https://thenewstack.io/deep-learning-ai-tool-identifies-fake-news-with-automated-fact-checking/) avenues
for countering disinformation by reducing the time and resources needed
for detection. AI-based solutions have been adopted, for example, to
identify social media bots]{.underline}** through [[automated

or bot-labelling (i.e., detecting and labelling fake social media
accounts). The pace and scale of disinformation on social media is also
increasingly challenging the reliance on manual fact-checking,
indicating that a level of automation may indeed be required to
effectively address the social media-based disinformation challenge. AI
can also play an enabling role in efforts to foster wider institutional
and societal resilience to disinformation. This can include
the [[integration ]{.underline}](https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/using-machine-learning-to-detect-malign-information-efforts.html)of
AI-based detection into toolkits and applications that flag false or
misleading content on social media to users while also educating them
about various information manipulation techniques, thus advancing
digital literacy.

### 2024 Election

#### Russia is more willing to take drastic action for 2024 elections

**Bertrand, Cohen, Lillis & Lyngaas**, **'22**, \"US assesses Putin may
increase efforts to interfere with US elections,\" CNN,
<https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/11/politics/us-russia-election-interference/index.html>,
4-11-2022\-- AL

The intelligence community has made understanding Putin's mindset a
priority since early in the invasion, sources familiar with internal
deliberations told CNN. [Raw assessments have pointed to his
increasingly unpredictable behavior, and US officials believe Putin is
more willing to consider taking risks due to his anger over Russia's
failures in Ukraine -- something his advisers, who officials say have
not been telling him the full truth, did not prepare him
for.]{.underline} The Associated Press reported on Saturday that [Putin
may use US support for Ukraine as a pretext to interfere in US
elections]{.underline}. Lawmakers were briefed by intelligence officials
last week on Putin's calculus on potential influence operations,
according to another US official familiar with the briefing. The
briefing acknowledged that, should Putin shift his focus to inflicting
harm outside of Ukraine, US midterm elections this year present one
possible target for Russian operatives, according to the US official.
[Russian actors also attempted to influence the 2016 and 2020
elections.]{.underline} The briefing did not suggest there was specific
intelligence saying that the Kremlin would target US elections,
according to the official, but rather that [elections are one of
multiple areas that the Russian government could target for influence
operations in response to the war in Ukraine.]{.underline} Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley testifies before the House
Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill, April 5, 2022 in Washington,
DC. US readies for long-term European security ramp-up after Russia\'s
invasion "If Putin feels backed into a corner he may turn his cyber
forces in any number of directions," the US official said, adding that
officials are on heightened alert given US midterm elections this year.
While it would be difficult for Russia to tamper with voter tallies,
another source noted that Russia would not need to change many, if any,
votes "to throw the security of the entire voting enterprise into
question." [Even if Russian hacking efforts did not affect the outcome
at all, sowing chaos and distrust in the voting systems could be enough
of a victory]{.underline}, another source said. When asked about the
assessments, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
declined to comment. "Our Election Threats Executive continues to lead
the Intelligence Community's efforts against foreign threats to US
elections," ODNI spokesman Nicole de Haay said in a statement to CNN.
Elections are not the only target Russia could have in mind. The US
government has begun warning about the possibility that Russia could try
to attack US critical infrastructure, urging private sector owners and
operators to be prepared. "All businesses, all critical infrastructure
owners and operators need to assume that disruptive cyber activity is
something that the Russians are thinking about, that are preparing for,
that are exploring options, as the President said," Jen Easterly,
director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,
told CNN late last month.

#### **Russia has been making the first move, causing a ton of destructions**

**MILLER '22** (MAGGIE MILLER, a cybersecurity reporter for POLITICO,
"Russian hackers targeting U.S., other Ukraine allies," newsletter,
issue, 06/22/22,
https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/22/russian-hackers-target-u-s-00041342)-KN

**[Russian intelligence agencies have been hacking into scores of
organizations in the U.S. and other Ukraine-allied
countries]{.underline}**, according to a Microsoft report that shows
Russia waging a global cyberwar alongside its attacks in Ukraine.

In the report released Wednesday, Microsoft said that **[Russian hackers
have attempted to infiltrate networks at more than 100 organizations in
the U.S.]{.underline}** and dozens across 42 other countries since
Russia invaded Ukraine in February. [Targets have included the foreign
ministries of NATO states, humanitarian organizations, think tanks, IT
groups and energy suppliers.]{.underline} The hackers successfully
infiltrated these networks in almost 30 percent of the attempts, and
managed to steal data in about a quarter of those instances. "**[The
destructive cyberattacks have been underreported because in a way, they
are invisible to the naked eye, you only know they happen when they
succeed]{.underline}**," Microsoft President Brad Smith said during
remarks at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute. "But
what we see from our perspective at the Microsoft Threat Intelligence
Center and the literally 24 trillion signals a day is that it has been a
formidable, intensive, even ferocious set of attacks." [The U.S. has
been the main target]{.underline}, but [Russian hackers
have]{.underline} also [directed attacks at Polish groups helping
deliver humanitarian aid to Ukraine, along with organizations in Baltic
nations and Turkey.Ukraine has also been widely targeted]{.underline}.
Microsoft found evidence that the Russian military conducted
cyberattacks against 48 Ukrainian government agencies and other
organizations, though Ukraine has been able to successfully repel most
of these attacks. These have included cyberattacks coordinated with
missile strikes on railroads and other transportation systems, and an
attempt to breach the network of the nuclear power company in
Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine in early March --- the day before it was occupied
by Russian troops.

[Ukraine has suffered a slew of cyberattacks in the runup to the Russian
invasion and during the fighting. Just prior to the Russian
invasion]{.underline}, Ukrainian banking and government websites were
temporarily taken offline by hackers who overwhelmed the networks with
traffic in so-called distributed denial of service attacks. Last month,
[the U.S., the United Kingdom and the European Union formally blamed
Russia for a cyberattack in February that took out a major Ukrainian
satellite provider]{.underline}, and Ukrainian officials said in April
that the country had repelled a **[Russian cyberattack on its energy
sector that would have knocked out power for millions of
Ukrainians]{.underline}**. And in May, Ukrainian authorities accused
Russia of trying to cause a "humanitarian disaster" in the country
through aiming cyberattacks against humanitarian operations. Russian
influence operations have also come to the forefront during the ongoing
conflict. [Microsoft reported that Russian disinformation operations are
concentrated on domestic audiences to help maintain support for the war,
the Ukrainian population to undermine morale, and American and European
countries to undermine unity. **The disinformation is also
aimed**]{.underline} at what Microsoft described as "nonaligned
countries," including through attempting to blame Western nations for
global food shortages resulting from the invasion of Ukraine.

#### Try or die for the affirmative -- disinformation campaigns are only going to become more sophisticated in the 2024 election cycle.  

Ashley **Parker**, 9-28-**2021**, \"As Trump hints at 2024 comeback,
democracy advocates fear a 'worst-case scenario' for the country,\"
Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-trump-hints-at-2024-comeback-democracy-advocates-fear-a-worst-case-scenario-for-the-country/2021/09/28/ee357558-1a47-11ec-914a-99d701398e5a_story.html

In recent weeks, Trump has maneuvered to firmly establish himself as the
predominant and most powerful figure in Republican politics. He has
injected his voice into federal and state campaigns, endorsing several
secretary of state candidates who embraced his false fraud claims and
worked to overturn the results of the 2020 election. And while still
banned from Twitter, he has issued a flurry of angry tweet-like
statements through his political action committee.

He has also reemerged at rallies, appearing last Saturday in Perry, Ga.,
with another rally planned for Oct. 9, at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in
Des Moines. Speaking in Perry, the former president promised to "make
America great again" and called for "an earth-shattering win in November
2022," before looking ahead to the next presidential election. "We're
not forgetting 2020," Trump said. "The most corrupt election in the
history of our country. Most corrupt election in the history of most
countries, to be followed by an even more glorious victory in November
of 2024." **[In some ways, the concerns among Democrats, constitutional
scholars and democracy advocates about what the return of Trump could
mean are simply one side of a coin, with Trump supporters representing
the flip side]{.underline}**. A majority of Republicans still support
Trump leading their party, according to polls. [A CNN
poll](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/15/politics/cnn-poll-most-americans-democracy-under-attack/index.html) released
in September found that 68 percent of Republicans and those who lean
Republican say democracy is under attack, with about 7 in 10 of them
believing that President Biden didn't win the 2020 election. One side's
nightmare scenario --- **[Trump running in 2024 and reclaiming the
presidency --- represents to the other side simply the democratic system
working as it should. The threats to democracy that Trump critics
envision are largely twofold. One real risk, they say, is that four
years after the failed Jan. 6 insurrection, Trump and his supporters
emerge in 2024 more sophisticated and successful in their efforts to
steal an election]{.underline}**. "For me, **[the scary part is, in
2020, this was not a particularly sophisticated misinformation or
disinformation campaign,"]{.underline}** **[said Matt Masterson, who ran
election security at the Department of Homeland Security between 2018 to
2020.]{.underline}** Referring to some of the outlandish conspiracy
theories of ballot fraud posited in the wake of the 2020 election by
Trump's allies, he added: "We're talking about bamboo ballots and
Italian satellites and dead dictators." **[In the future, Masterson
said, these sorts of falsehoods are going to become more advanced and
nuanced --- exploiting genuine areas of confusion in the electoral
system --- and thus harder to combat.]{.underline}**

your own thing. I think that approach is one that frightens other
members of NATO, and [**they wonder are we committed to NATO, and to our
mutual defense, or are we all going to go off on our own?** And so they
wonder. - Are they ever going to get over that, do you
think?]{.underline} - Well, they wonder whether we\'re going to return
to the\-- if you will\-- the policies that we\'ve had for the last 70
years, or whether we\'re instead going to take the turn that Donald
Trump represented. If he were to come back as the US President I think
it would represent a pretty dramatic departure for the world, and they
would rethink whether they can count on the United States to lead NATO,
and to lead other nations as they push back against China and against
Russia. - So you think that the 2024 election will decide this question?
About permanent damage to Nato? - I think if President Trump were to
return as president, that the nations of the world would say that they
have to really rethink. \[MUSIC PLAYING\]

#### Russia wont deploy hypersonic missiles

nowhere fast,\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
<https://thebulletin.org/2020/01/hypersonic-missiles-new-arms-race-going-nowhere-fast/>
//jsam

Speaking on December 24, 2019[, Russian President Vladimir **Putin
marked the deployment of Russia's first nuclear-capable hypersonic
missile system**]{.underline}, noting, "Today, we have a unique
situation in our new and recent history. \[Other countries\] are trying
to catch up with us. **[Not a single country possesses hypersonic
weapons]{.underline}**, let alone continental-range hypersonic weapons."

The question that is now facing policy makers in Washington, Beijing,
London, and elsewhere is whether and how this deployment reshapes
strategic stability.

The answer, perhaps counterintuitive amid the hand-wringing over
Moscow's announcement, is not much. In reality, [the systemic
**consequences of hypersonic missiles will be minimal to nil,** and the
narrative that Washington is "behind" in a hypersonic arms race fails to
take into account the different strategic challenges facing China,
Russia, and the United States---not least that the United States need
not overcome an adversary's missile defense systems.]{.underline}

Maneuverable missiles. [Hypersonic missiles travel faster than Mach
5]{.underline} (approximately 3,800 miles per hour) and have the ability
to maneuver during flight. [Existing research and design efforts
associated with hypersonic weapons have focused on two types of missile
technologies.]{.underline} The first, a boost-glide vehicle, is designed
to sit on top of an existing ICBM and to be launched on a normal
ballistic trajectory before being released and maneuvering to a target
without any additional propulsion. [Russia's recently-deployed Avangard
system serves as an example of this type of hypersonic weapon. The
second type, perhaps more complex to develop and deploy, is a hypersonic
cruise missile.]{.underline} This type of weapon involves a supersonic
combustion ramjet or turboramjet engine that would provide in-flight
propulsion, and this feature would allow it to travel at significantly
lower altitude than its boost-glide counterpart. In both cases, though
these missiles are named for their speed, it is their potential
maneuverability that represents the central concern surrounding the
effects of their deployment.

Hypersonics and missile defense. Just as missile defense systems
represent an antidote to traditional nuclear missiles that travel on a
ballistic trajectory, hypersonic weapons represent an innovation to
overcome these defenses. As a result**, [it is difficult to discuss the
strategic effects of hypersonic weapons without taking into account the
current state missile defense capabilities.]{.underline}**

Among those who frame hypersonic weapons as a strategic game-changer,
there are three aspects of missile defense that are too often ignored.
[First, missile defense technologies remain in their infancy, with the
United States the only country possessing significant numbers of
deployed missile defense systems. Second, US capabilities are explicitly
deployed to deter North Korea and Iran---not peer or near-peer
competitors like Russia or China. As the 2019 Missile Defense Review
notes, "Today's US missile defenses provide significant protection
against potential North Korean or Iranian ballistic missile strikes
against the US homeland, and will improve as necessary to stay ahead of
missile threats from rogue states." Finally, amid a mixed test record
with debates surrounding the appropriateness of test conditions, it
remains **unclear whether existing US missile defense technologies are
as successful as policy makers might like.**]{.underline}

In light of the above and in the near term, Moscow's deployment of
hypersonic nuclear weapons changes little. Given [that **US missile
defense systems are not designed to address the threat posed by peer
competitors**]{.underline} with large numbers of nuclear weapons, the
vulnerability of the United States to a nuclear attack from Russia is
the same in January 2020 as it was in November 2019, prior to Russia
fielding this class of weapon. The fact that both Washington and Moscow
rely on their respective mutual vulnerability---not missile defense
technologies---to deter nuclear warfare remains unchanged. Among those
who theorize that missile defense itself is destabilizing, hypersonic
missiles may actually strengthen strategic stability by reinforcing
rather than degrading the mutual vulnerability upon which nuclear
deterrence rests.

#### Russian hypersonic missiles are defective in current war but they still have extravagant number

John **Grady, 5-19-2022**, John Grady, a former managing editor of Navy
Times, retired as director of communications for the Association of the
United States Army. His reporting on national defense and national

The **[Kremlin's most advanced missile systems are not operating
effectively in Russia's conflict with Ukraine]{.underline}**, U.S.
Northern Command chief Air Force Gen. Glen VanHerck said Wednesday
before the Senate Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee.

The Russians have "had challenges with some of their hypersonic missiles
as far as accuracy," he told the panel.

"I will tell you, originally, we thought they weren't working at a rate
that was as good as ours. But what I would say is, they're on par with
our capabilities, not all of them, specifically their cruise missiles,"
VanHerck said.

**[Despite Russia's overall inaccuracy in firing all of its
missiles]{.underline}**, John Plumb, the assistant secretary of defense
for space policy, said "the sobering reality" is that the **[estimated
1,500 missiles Russia has fired since the Feb. 24
invasion]{.underline}** targeted Ukrainian civilians.

The witnesses agreed it was the largest employment of missile systems
since World War II.

As the fighting in Ukraine has evolved, Army Lt. Gen. Daniel Karbler
said Kyiv needs offensive and defensive missile systems for a layered
defense and to stymie maneuvers on the ground. Among the systems he
mentioned were Patriot, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and
specialized mortars.

Characterizing the hypersonic "arms race." **[Alongside concerns
surrounding strategic stability, US policy makers have also expressed
concern that the United States is "behind" in a hypersonic arms
race---with deployment of US hypersonic capabilities
currently [slated](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/us/politics/russia-hypersonic-weapon.html) for
2022.]{.underline}** To the extent to which there is a "race"
surrounding hypersonic weapon systems at all, Russia and China do enjoy
an [advantage](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/380364-china-russia-eclipse-us-in-hypersonic-missiles-prompting-fears) in
the development of hypersonic technology---measured by the number of
successful hypersonic weapon tests. Prior to Putin's announcement,
China's DF-ZF boost-glide vehicle
had [achieved](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/170421_Cancian_PONI2016_Web.pdf?nwHMP3v85oG_fo1GB6E.w9aqWw7.SsvK#page=142) the
most success in testing, while India and France
are [reported](https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/03/hypersonic-missiles-a-new-proliferation-challenge.html) to
be close behind. Against the backdrop of a historical record in which
Moscow has long had more [diverse nuclear
options](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00963402.2019.1580891?needAccess=true) compared
to the United States, what should military analysts make of the US
failure to develop and deploy hypersonic weapons first? The answer: very
little. As noted above, **[the United States is the primary developer of
missile defense technologies, with Moscow and Beijing registering their
objections to various US deployments in Europe and East Asia over the
past two decades. Amid concerns that US missile defense systems might
eventually be used against them---and particularly in the absence of
their own missile defense capabilities---investment in hypersonic
weapons makes sense for both Moscow and Beijing. In the language of
strategists, research and development of hypersonic weapons represent a
"hedge" against future advancements in US missile defense technologies.
This driver is [not
present](https://nuclearnetwork.csis.org/hypersonic-hysteria-examining-hypersonic-hammer/) for
the United States. As such, nuclear-armed hypersonic weapons would
provide [few if
any](https://thebulletin.org/2019/12/hypersonic-missiles-three-questions-every-reader-should-ask/) appreciable
benefits to the existing US nuclear capabilities encapsulated in the
nuclear triad.]{.underline}** This reality is also reflected in the fact
that the current research and development programs in the United States
focus
on [conventional](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2019/11/7/doe-official-say-us-is-not-pursuing-nuclear-hypersonic-weapons) rather
than nuclear payloads for hypersonic weapon systems. Others have
also [noted](https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/10/04/china-s-ballyhooed-new-hypersonic-missile-isn-t-exactly-game-changer-pub-79998) that
this conventional focus increases the accuracy requirements of US
hypersonic weapons---which may explain some of the delay in their
deployment. Commentary suggesting that increased US investment in
hypersonic weapons is needed to "match" or "lead" are also incongruous
with the various offset strategies used by the United States to engage
in military competition over the past six decades. For example, faced
with superior Russian conventional forces in Europe in the 1950s,
Eisenhower [armed](https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/role-offset-strategies-restoring-conventional-deterrence) a
much smaller US ground force with battlefield nuclear weapons---using a
technological solution to asymmetrically compensate for a strategic
disadvantage. More recently, the third offset
strategy [sought](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/991434/deputy-secretary-third-offset-strategy-bolsters-americas-military-deterrence/) to
"include autonomous learning systems for handling big data and
determining patterns, human-machine collaboration for more timely
relevant decision making, and assisted human operations"---and using
these technological capabilities as a force multiplier. In both cases,
military planners did not seek to match an adversary capability for
capability. Instead, they sought a policy solution that addressed the
underlying strategic threat. These offset strategies offer benefits both
in terms of flexibility and reducing the resource cost of strategic
competition, and it is unclear why this logic would be abandoned in the
context of hypersonic missile threats.

## Latin America

#### Russia/Venezuela partnership destabilizes latin America

Latin America,\" Diálogo Américas,
https://dialogo-americas.com/articles/russia-venezuela-military-partnership-a-threat-to-latin-america/#.YrQEn3bMLrd\--AL

The [Venezuelan]{.underline} regime's [support for]{.underline} the
Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} government [amid Russia's invasion of
Ukraine is a destabilizing factor for Latin America.]{.underline}
"Russia has the full support of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,"
Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro said, upon receiving Russian Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Borisov at the Miraflores Palace on February 16, 2022. "We
have ratified the path of powerful military cooperation between Russia
and Venezuela," he added. [Russia and China are the Venezuelan regime's
main weapon suppliers.]{.underline} According to Rear Admiral (ret.)
Carlos Molina Tamayo, former head of Armament for the National
Bolivarian Armed Force, who lives in exile in Spain, following his
participation in the coup against Hugo Chávez in 2002[, Moscow has
delivered weapons systems worth more than **\$15 billion** to Venezuela
since the 2000s]{.underline}. In addition, "the Venezuelan NGO Control
Ciudadano detailed in 2021 Venezuela's purchase from Russia of an
unspecified quantity of Orlan 10, an unmanned aerial vehicle for
reconnaissance operations," Voice of America said on January 18. [But
this connection goes much further. Julio Borges,]{.underline} former
foreign envoy for Interim President Juan Guaidó[, warned that Maduro and
Putin's goal is to **destabilize the region**,]{.underline} with the
partnership of Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega and Cuba's Miguel Díaz Canel.
"They have opened the region's doors for Putin to import a conflict that
is not ours, putting hemispheric security at risk. Our region cannot be
part of Russia's international chess game," Borges said via Twitter on
February 24, as Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. [Days
before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei
Riabkov said he could not confirm nor rule out the possibility of
sending Russian military assets to Venezuela,]{.underline} Voice of
America reported. Weapons for guerrillas At present, however, the
greater concern is that irregular armed groups could get their hands on
light weapon systems Russia delivered to the Venezuelan regime.
According to Molina Tamayo, these weapons range from AK-103 rifles to
the Igla-S surface-to-air missile systems. "Chávez's purchase of AK
rifles was in the interest of getting closer to Russia," he said. [The
most serious issue has to do with the Igla-S system. In 2017, Reuters
reported that, according to a military document its teams were able to
review, the Maduro regime would have some 5,000 Russian-made
surface-to-air missiles. Since then, government officials of the
region]{.underline} and foreign affairs experts have [expressed concerns
that these weapons could be **slipping out of the regime's hands** and
into those of irregular armed groups, such as the National liberation
Army,]{.underline} and dissident groups of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia. In February 2019, the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration warned about increasing risk to U.S. civil aviation of
flying "into, out of, within or over the territory and airspace of
Venezuela," due to the concern that the regime could lose control some
its man portable air defense systems, which could in turn be used by
non-state armed actors. Amid the conflict over the invasion of Ukraine,
Molina Tamayo says that Putin's plan is to cement Venezuela, as well as
Cuba and Nicaragua's, "'pro-Russian,' \[stance\] in order to annoy the
United States."

#### Russia is increasing influence in Latin America to counteract US influence.

[Russians still believe that Latin America is a backyard of the United
States]{.underline} and that it should be considered their exclusive
area of influence,\" Rouvinski said. \"[So they want to reach out to
this area precisely to carry out reciprocal actions.]{.underline}\" He
explains that many [Russian elites see the world in terms of spheres of
influence, and believe the United States is encroaching on theirs with
unpopular actions in countries like Belarus and Ukraine]{.underline}.
\"Vladimir Putin and the Russian elites believe that parts of Eastern
Europe and some Central Asian countries naturally belong to the Russian
sphere,\" Rouvinski said. \"They believe that nothing should happen
there without the explicit or implicit permission of Russian
authorities,\" he added. American involvement in these places has led
the Kremlin to plan their own retaliation. [But instead of exploring
direct military interventions or investing billions into local
infrastructure projects, Russian officials have relied on trade,
diplomacy and media savvy to expand their influence in Latin
America.]{.underline} [Russian trade in the region has increased by 44%
since 2006]{.underline} to nearly \$12 billion in 2020. Over the past
year, [high-ranking Russian and Latin American officials have met much
more frequently to discuss collaboration and negotiate bilateral trade
agreements]{.underline}. Just last week, Brazilian President Jair
Bolsanaro visited Moscow to discuss a strategic partnership between the
nations. \"We jointly strive to develop political, economic and
humanitarian ties,\" Putin told a news conference at the conclusion of
the meeting. \"We closely cooperate on the international stage.\"

#### Russia gaining ground in Latin America but U.S. can push back.

By Vladimir Rouvinski, 2-13-2017, \"Kennan Cable No.20: Understanding
Russian Priorities in Latin America,\" Wilson Center,
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/kennan-cable-no20-understanding-russian-priorities-latin-america

For Russia, the key value of Latin America and the Caribbean is its
geographical proximity to the United States. In the eyes of the Kremlin,
it is Washington's "near abroad."  Moscow believes that its own "near
abroad," the territory of the former Soviet Union, to be a region where
Russia's interests must be taken into consideration by all other states.
The Russian government further believes that the United States
consistently ignores Russian interests, and for this reason Russia must
amplify its presence in Latin America in response. As early as 1997, the
then-Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, while visiting Latin America,
reportedly said that if Russia maintains a presence in the region, it
might help Russia deal with the West in Russia's neighboring
territories.[\[vi\]](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/kennan-cable-no20-understanding-russian-priorities-latin-america#_edn6) This
vision was only reinforced in the following years: in 2013, Moscow
declared its relations with Latin America were of "strategic"
importance.[\[vii\]](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/kennan-cable-no20-understanding-russian-priorities-latin-america#_edn7)

During the crisis in Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine in 2014, Russia
displayed hesitation in part because of the presence of the U.S. Navy in
the Black Sea and by Washington's support for Tbilisi and Kyiv. From
this perspective, the flashy but brief sword-rattling in South and
Central America can be explained as a kind of logic of reciprocity:
Moscow first sent its war planes and navy ships to the Western
Hemisphere soon after the Russian-Georgian 2008 war, while signs of
increased military cooperation with Nicaragua coincided with the
deterioration of the situation in Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea.
But the notion of reciprocity in the "U.S. near abroad" extends far
beyond the military sphere. Latin America occupies a particular place in
the political spectacle underway on Russian television. The
extraordinary popularity of Vladimir Putin in Russia stems mainly from a
common perception in Russia that he has restored Russia's role as a
world power, with the United States reemerging as Russia's most
important rival. **[Russian activities in Latin America provide the
Russian mainstream media with opportunities to portray Russia as a
rising world power capable of establishing its presence even in the
United States' "backyard."]{.underline}** The regular visits by Russia's
president and other top officials receive prominent coverage on major
Russian TV channels and popular print media. This coverage particularly
increased after 2008, when the joint declarations of Russian and Latin
American political figures from the ALBA countries, Argentina, and
Brazil began to include references to the imperative role Russia will
play in constructing a new "just" world political order against the
wishes of Washington and America's allies. With the continuing Ukrainian
crisis and Russia's direct involvement in Syria, Russian
government-controlled media now often reports on how Latin American
leaders support the Russian position. Other activities that get covered
include, but are not limited to, joint celebrations of events such as
the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War (a high-level
delegation from Moscow took part in the festivities in Cuba), joint
opening of memorials to local iconic leaders (such as the Chavez
Memorial Museum in Venezuela), or Vladimir Putin and Kristina Fernandez
launching Russia Today's Spanish-language broadcasting as a national
public channel in Argentina. When they visit Russia, Latin American
heads of state are taken to the Great Patriotic War memorials or are
shown paying respect to Russian national traditions (for example, Hugo
Chavez was awarded the title of Honorary Cossack). **[As a result of the
efforts by the Russian media, today the Russian general public is much
better aware of Latin America and its importance for Russia than in the
recent past: According to Russian surveys asking to name nations
friendly to Russia, not a single Latin American nation was listed in
2006; by 2008 several started to appear]{.underline}**; and, by 2016,
Cuba, Venezuela, and Brazil made it to the top 10 list of countries
friendliest to
Russia.[\[viii\]](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/kennan-cable-no20-understanding-russian-priorities-latin-america#_edn8)

#### Latin American relations vulnerable due to Trump era trade policy.

The Financial Times Editorial Board 6-8-2022, \"The US's lack of
ambition risks losing Latin America,\" No Publication,
https://www.ft.com/content/5e579b12-e0c1-41c0-8600-ae394ef48c8f

The United States this week hosts a summit of leaders from across the
Americas for the first time in 28 years. What should be a golden
opportunity for Washington to show leadership risks instead highlighting
the decline of US influence close to home. The president of Mexico, the
most important US ally and its biggest regional trading partner, will
not attend the summit. Andrés Manuel López Obrador ruled out going after
Washington refused to invite the leaders of Cuba, Nicaragua and
Venezuela because they were not democracies. Honduras and Bolivia also
shunned the summit over the selective guest list. The presidents of El
Salvador and Guatemala, both smarting from US criticism, appeared
unlikely to go. Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro only agreed to show up after
extracting the promise of a first bilateral meeting with Joe Biden.
Caribbean nations successfully lobbied to stop the US from inviting
Venezuela's opposition chief Juan Guaidó. The squabbling is unfortunate
because **[Latin America matters. A major fuel and food producer, the
region could help fill the gap in global supply left by the war in
Ukraine and the boycott of Russia]{.underline}**. Latin America has the
world's biggest reserves of lithium and is rich in other metals. It has
excellent locations for generating wind and solar power. Less happily,
it is also the source of most of the world's cocaine. When Bill Clinton
convened the inaugural Summit of the Americas in 1994, he did not need
to cajole presidents into coming. On offer was a bold initiative: the
promise of a free trade area stretching from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.
Those negotiations ended in failure but the idea remains a high water
mark for US ambition in the region. Judged against that yardstick, this
week's promised offerings look meagre. Washington is touting a
"partnership for economic prosperity", a migration declaration and the
promise of \$300mn in assistance. These are poor substitutes for
ambitious trade deals and major infrastructure investment, which could
transform Latin America's growth prospects and stimulate US companies to
relocate manufacturing closer to home. The no-shows from Mexico and
Central America and the non-invitation of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela
are particularly awkward for the migration declaration. It will not bear
the signatures of the presidents of countries behind the biggest
increase in illegal US border crossings in two decades**[. The Biden
administration's aversion to new trade treaties has robbed it of what
should be a trump card. Ecuador and Uruguay's pro-US governments are
among those frustrated at the difficulty of engaging Washington to
negotiate on commerce and investment. There have been other
disappointments. Little has been done to change the Trump-era punishment
policies which have failed to bring democracy to Cuba, Venezuela and
Nicaragua.]{.underline}**

#### Latin America key to solve sanctions

Council, "Upcoming Summit Could Begin to Heal US-Latin America Ties,"

[The **Biden administration should** use the Summit to describe the
region's importance to key White House priorities]{.underline}, from
Build Back Better to the Indo-Pacific Strategy, **[including strategic
competition with Beijing and the recently unveiled Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework]{.underline}**. U.S. officials have indicated that they intend
to discuss issues related to the Framework at the Summit. But **[they
should]{.underline}** also **[explicitly invite Latin American countries
to participate in it]{.underline}**, following the precedent of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which includes Mexico, Chile, Peru,
and Canada. U.S. officials should come prepared to explain how **[Latin
American can help counter Chinese and Russian efforts to upend
international norms and promote authoritarian practices]{.underline}**.
As part of this, they should describe and explicitly criticize China's
support for Russia's Ukraine invasion to counter propaganda and false
messaging from Beijing and Moscow.

The **[Biden administration]{.underline}**, which recently designated
Colombia a major non-NATO ally along with Brazil and Argentina, should
invite more **[Latin American partners to cooperate with the
alliance]{.underline}**. Here again, [Russia's invasion of Ukraine and
Beijing's support would be a timely topic of discussion.]{.underline}
One specific area of cooperation might be migration---**[NATO is
currently dealing with the forced displacement of Ukrainians, while
Latin America faces similar challenges, such as the massive displacement
of Venezuelans, largely to Colombia.]{.underline}** Another useful topic
to discuss would be alternative sources of critical goods. Brazil,for
example, has been reluctant to punish Moscow with sanctions because its
food supply depends on Russian fertilizer.

Still another would be safeguarding data networks. **[The Clean Network
provides a helpful framework]{.underline}**, **[which a few Latin
American countries---Brazil, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic---have
already signed on to]{.underline}**.By highlighting the hemisphere's
importance to global challenges, the White House would signal that it is
prioritizing ties with its neighbors---and not solely to advance U.S.
interests. [Acknowledging the extra-hemispheric dynamics that compound
regional challenges is important, but rather than harp on the risks of
engagement with China, Washington should propose better alternatives,
framing them in terms of advancing the region's security and economic
interests.]{.underline}

follow Biden's lead. That means --- [at least in

Putin can still rely on [some west­ern

war posture. Moreover, Russia has found recept­ive trad­ing part­ners
beyond the West. India, for instance, has begun snap­ping up [discoun­ted

extend­ing Russi­a's economic viab­il­ity.

In the mean­time, ordin­ary Russi­ans will exper­i­ence the sharp sting of

sanc­tions nomin­ally targeted at govern­ing elites often exact the most
severe toll on the people most atten­u­ated from govern­mental
decision-making. These sanc­tions on Russia --- issued in response to
brazen viol­a­tions of inter­na­tional law --- will likely be no excep­tion.
Indeed, that might be the point. Rather than an unin­ten­ded byproduct of
sanc­tions aimed at govern­ment actors, mass hard­ship might repres­ent an

popu­lar [pres­sure](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/us/politics/russia-sanctions-ukraine.html),
force Putin's atten­tion inward,
and [sap](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-02-28/new-russian-sanctions-playbook) the
energy and resources required for war. This is "sanc­tions from the
bottom up," and it appears to be a larger part of the United States'
play­book with each passing day. Biden's advisors had previ­ously
disclaimed "even the appear­ance of target­ing" ordin­ary Russi­ans.

"any leader, whether you're an auto­crat or a small-'d' demo­crat, has to
pay atten­tion to the living stand­ards of your coun­try. And already,
we're seeing the effects of these meas­ures." It is clear that spillover
effects will not be limited to the Russian people. The uncer­tainty
induced by war and the shock of sanc­tions have
already [driven](https://time.com/6155581/russia-sanctions-global-economic-impact/) a

prices, [raised](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/business/economy/russia-ukraine-sanctions-economy.html) the

disrup­tions. In the longer term, sanc­tions might fuel infla­tion
and [curtail](https://time.com/6155581/russia-sanctions-global-economic-impact/) economic

#### Even if sanctions aren't effective in general, they can be effective on Russia.

Brian **O'Toole and** Daniel **Fried** 6-24-**2022**, \"Sanctioning
Russia is a long game. Here's how to win.,\" Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/sanctioning-russia-is-a-long-game-heres-how-to-win/

As the G7 considers these crucial near-term policy actions, it will also
need to consider how to keep the pressure on Russia now that the initial
flurry of sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has
given way to what will likely be a longer war---and an even longer
effort to isolate and weaken Putin and his regime. An effective policy
is one that ramps up pressure on Moscow while deepening its political
isolation, highlighting Russian atrocities in Ukraine. Here are several
additional measures policymakers should consider along those lines:

1.  **Restrict additional Russian exports. **After oil and gas,
    major [Russian exports
    include](https://www.worldstopexports.com/russias-top-10-exports/) gems,
    gold, and other precious metals; iron and steel products; aluminum;
    and wood. The EU has already imposed restrictions on many of these;
    the United States should follow suit. Both the United States and the
    EU, as well as the United Kingdom, could also use sanctions (some of
    which are already imposed) to target Russian shipping and insurance
    sectors and thwart Russian efforts to redirect exports otherwise
    intended for the United States or Europe. Market impact, however,
    may augur against action targeting big Russian companies, such as
    Rusal, that have dominant global positions---since sanctions would
    likely cause further inflation or supply-chain disruptions. 

2.  **Extend export controls and bans on products and technologies to
    Russia. **One of the more impactful economic steps taken in the
    initial package of post-invasion measures was the Biden
    administration's use of the Foreign Direct Product Rule to ban
    exports of semiconductors to Russia that are based on US parts,
    technology, or licensing. That amounted to an effective ban and has
    had a negative impact on Russian production of automobiles, tanks,
    and other sophisticated manufactured products. It will take some
    effort to properly enforce this ban over time, since the Russians
    will seek to circumvent it. The United States, EU, United Kingdom,
    and G7 partners should additionally seek to identify other niche
    export bans to continue pressuring Russian manufacturing. To
    institutionalize export controls, the United States should also
    reestablish the Cold War-era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
    Export Controls, which proved effective in planning and executing
    export controls on the Soviet Union. 

3.  **Step up enforcement against sanctions evasion. **The massive
    sanctions imposed on Russia since February 24 will inspire massive
    efforts at evasion. The Russian government, Russian companies, and
    sanctioned individuals already [appear to be
    considering](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/russian-exports-commodities-traders-dubai-switzerland-sanctions-ukraine-moscow-war-2022-6) using
    non-EU countries, such as Turkey and Middle East nations, to
    establish sanctions-evasion operations or otherwise provide
    "material support" for sanctioned persons (a step that would leave a
    "material supporter" vulnerable to their own sanctions). Such
    actions could include helping sanctioned Russian banks raise
    capital, supporting sanctioned individuals (even those in Putin's
    inner circle), or helping Russia evade the EU's oil restrictions.
    China, however, may be taking earlier US cautions seriously and,
    according to US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, has [not
    yet engaged in sanctions
    evasion](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-says-china-has-not-crossed-lines-russia-beijing-offers-closer-ties) on
    Russia's behalf. But this will bear continued scrutiny and warnings
    to governments considering assisting Russia in sanctions evasion,
    steps that Biden administration sources tell us they are already
    starting to take.

4.  **Impose additional corporate and individual sanctions. **The EU,
    United States, and United Kingdom have continued to impose full
    blocking or other sanctions against Russian banks and companies,
    including Russian oligarchs. These should continue with an emphasis
    on quality, not quantity, when it comes to individual sanctions; it
    is best to target those close to Putin and his circle rather than
    impose individual sanctions by the thousands. This means continuing
    to expose Putin's wallets and agents, such as Yevgeny Prigozhin,
    believed to be the financier for key Kremlin operations such as the
    Internet Research Agency troll farm and the Wagner mercenary group.
    While Russian businesses and businessmen may not hold much sway over
    Putin's decision making, freezing yachts and million-dollar
    properties is an important symbol in the pressure campaign against
    Russia---and an easier success story to explain than more
    complicated, even if strategic, economic measures. 

5.  **Institute transparency standards for doing business with
    Russia.** The United States, United Kingdom, and EU, possibly in
    concert with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
    Development, could develop transparency standards with respect to
    doing business with Russia, including disclosure standards for
    investments, trade, and ownership. This could include disclosure of
    Western business relations with Russian firms, equity holdings in
    Russian companies, and Russian equity holdings in Western companies;
    and an inventory of Russian investment, both direct and indirect, in
    Western countries. The Trump administration did the much-needed work
    to provide additional transparency and power to regulate foreign
    investment in the United States; a similar effort to address US
    investment abroad would be welcome. Transparency could prevent
    situations in which Russia gained control over key European or US
    economic assets or industries. (The Stanford University-led Russian
    sanctions working group, an informal set of experts from the United
    States and Europe led by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael
    McFaul, has been working on such ideas.)

Taken together, the economic steps suggested above amount to a shift
from the frantic, though understandable, post-invasion ratcheting up of
pressure to a mature punishment regime that seeks to isolate the Russian
economy for as long as Russia remains an aggressor nation. While Putin
remains Russia's leader, Moscow's relations with Washington, Brussels,
and other G7 governments will likely remain hostile. This state of
affairs will resemble the Cold War isolation of the Soviet Union,
pre-détente. Also as in the Cold War, Russia [will not be
isolated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/24/business/russia-oil-china-india-ukraine-war.html) from
China or from many countries in the Global South. While this continues
to dishearten many supporters of Ukraine, they should also remember:
Such relations did not help the Soviet Union in the end.

[Zarate says sanctions could play two important roles in the ongoing
peace talks. For one, they help shape how Russia feels the **costs of
its actions**]{.underline}, something he says should play into the
calculus of negotiators at the bargaining table. In other words, he
says, [they should understand that things are only going to get worse
for Russia as its economy continues to feel the effects of
sanctions]{.underline}. The conversation could also come to include the
lifting of certain sanctions, such as restrictions on trade or
investment. \"Every sanction that is used as a stick can also be used as
a carrot,\" Zarate says, adding that he has seen this in the case of
Iran and other countries that are seeking to get out from under the
pressure of economic sanctions. Zarate says a \"classic dilemma\" [with
the application of sanction is that if you\'re putting maximum pressure
on an economy, you\'re ultimately harming ordinary people and their
ability to operate commercially]{.underline}. \"[Whether or not the
regime leadership feels it directly, or whether or not they even care
about the effects on their population is a different
question]{.underline},\" he said, pointing to examples like Iraq\'s
Saddam Hussein and the Castros in Cuba. [Zarate says the sanctions
targeting **Russian oligarchs** have been a way to try to get at
Putin\'s assets.]{.underline} He sees them as an attempt to (at least
psychologically ) impact Putin\'s level of comfort and warn him that the
international community won\'t let him rest --- even if the Russian
people are bearing that cost.

The head of the President\'s Office, Andriy Yermak, has said that
sanctions against Russia should be tougher, with the need to include a
gas embargo in the new EU sanctions package. He wrote this on Telegram,
Ukrinform reports. \"The [G7 summit **must respond to
Russia**]{.underline}**\'**s strikes on Kyiv. [**Sanctions should be
more aggressive**. An embargo on gold exports is good, but a gas embargo
is needed in the new EU sanctions package]{.underline},\" Yermak said.

should be the **answer** to the **food crisis** orchestrated by
Russia]{.underline}. \"**[Recognition of Russia as a sponsor of
terrorism is very necessary]{.underline}**,\" he said. He also
reiterated that Ukraine needs more heavy weapons. \"More heavy weapons
for Ukraine is the way to victory over an enemy who understands only
force,\" Yermak said. Early on Sunday, June 26, several explosions
rocked Ukraine\'s capital Kyiv, with one missile hitting a nine-storey
residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district, partially
destroying the 7th, 8th and 9th floors. A three-day summit of the Group
of Seven countries began in the Bavarian Alps on Sunday, with world
leaders expected to discuss critical global challenges largely caused by
Russia\'s all-out invasion of Ukraine. In addition to the heads of state
and government of Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom,
France, Canada, Italy and Japan, European Commission President Ursula
von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel are taking
part in the summit.

members announced that they would ban imports of Russian gold, denying
President Vladimir Putin the revenue he needs to fund the war against
Ukraine. Penalties for the Kremlin could amount to tens of billions of
dollars, President Biden tweeted Sunday morning. Blinken, speaking
Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union," said the sanctions are having a
"dramatic" effect. "Well, first, let's take gold, the thing that we're
just announcing. That is the second-most-lucrative export that Russia
has after energy. It's about \$19 billion a year. And most of that is
within the G-7 countries," he said. Blinken added that [**Russia cannot

particular shortage has sent the wealthy elite into a spin: beauty
clinics are running out of Botox.]{.underline}** The business daily
newspaper Kommersant reported this month that Botox imports saw a
threefold drop to 74,500 units in the period between January and March
compared with the same time last year, after one western manufacturer
stopped exporting to Russia. [While the beauty industry is a small cog
in the machine**, the decision by western allies to sever financial and
trade ties with Russia has plunged the country's economy into a deep
recession, with the OECD forecasting a 10% contraction this year and a
fall of more than 4% in 2023. Sanctions** have not halted the military
assault, but some **are now asking whether a promise to lift them could
bring Russia to the negotiating table: a return to global markets, in
exchange for peace in Ukraine.**]{.underline} The British foreign
secretary, Liz Truss, held out such a prospect in March, when she
suggested Britain could lift sanctions if Russia commits to a full
ceasefire and withdrawal, with a promise of "no further aggression".
Some of the allies have closer links to Russia than others. Last week,
Germany's former premier Angela Merkel defended her decision to increase
trade links with Russia, and Germany's reliance on Russian hydrocarbons,
after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. "It is a great tragedy that it
didn't work, but I don't blame myself for trying," she said. But Tim
Ash, a Russia expert at the Chatham House thinktank, says Germany
underestimated Putin for a long time. He says sanctions, which should
have been tougher in response to Crimea, are working and should remain
in place. "**[The sanctions have exceeded most people's expectations and
they have exceeded Putin's as well,"]{.underline}** he says. "The
self-sanctioning by the likes of McDonald's has also hit the Russian
economy, with around 1,000 major businesses pulling out of the country
when they didn't need to. They weren't on any sanctions list." [**Output

[**The momentum behind Western sanctions against Vladimir Putin is

yet against the Russian war machine ---]{.underline} including a partial

crude to removing Putin's favorite cleric from the sanctions list.
Hungary's Viktor Orban, an admirer of Putin, is clearly playing a big
role in splintering the united front. But the risk of fatigue and waning
morale goes well beyond Budapest. The cost of hitting Putin where it
hurts --- energy --- is preying on many leaders' minds at a time of high
inflation and economic slowdown, as is the grim sight of Russia's
advance regaining momentum after 100 days of fighting. Along with
differences of opinion percolating inside and outside the EU over what
an endgame might look like, this doesn't bode well for the near term.
Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, who now must reassemble her

counterpart, Alexander De Croo, puts it. There's no easy fix for
sanctions fatigue. [**The "financial weapon" is an imperfect tool** that
is prone to patchy enforcement and unintended consequences]{.underline}.
The unprecedented scale of sanctions against Putin's inner circle, as
well as Russia's financial system, airlines and trade, will contribute
to an estimated 10% decline in Russian gross domestic product this year.
But it has not deterred or dislodged Putin. Worse, there have also been
some counterproductive effects. The rising price of energy has lined
Putin's pockets while impoverishing importers. Russia's oil-and-gas
revenue will be about \$285 billion this year, according to Bloomberg
Economics estimates. Throw in other commodities, and that more than
offsets \$300 billion in Russian foreign reserves frozen as part of the
sanctions. And while seizing the yachts and villas of wealthy oligarchs
feels good, [it's jarring to see Western firms leaving Russia sell
assets to those billionaires who are effectively too big to be
sanctioned. **Even if the long-term answer here will be to go harder and
faster against Russia, it will be vital to shore up economic defenses at
home first**.]{.underline} Barclays Plc estimates a full embargo on
Russian natural gas may reduce euro-area GDP by 4% compared to a
baseline scenario; without extra economic support for households, the
rhetoric of Orban --- who tastelessly compares energy sanctions to an
economic "nuclear bomb" --- will spread. Already, a YouGov survey from
April found European public opinion somewhat conflicted: More than 30%
of respondents in seven countries including Spain and Italy advocated
investing in trade and diplomacy with Russia, rather than defense and
security. [W**ithout light at the end of the economic tunnel, the public
mood might turn.** If this war drags on and becomes a test of morale,
**the West and the EU have the advantage in terms of resources and human
capital, a**s Miguel Otero Iglesias of the Elcano Royal Institute has
noted.]{.underline} But that comes with a need to protect the most
vulnerable in society; fiscal support should be "inevitable," he rightly
adds. Pandemic-style support measures should inspire Europe's next
policy steps, whether via the joint borrowing structure of the EU's
recovery fund or "SURE" loans offered to member states to protect
employment. Unity really will be strength at a time of rising interest
rates and fragile public finances --- especially as Putin starts to
throttle gas supplies to countries that don't play by his rules. It is
easy to assume, as some have, that the dividing line in this conflict is
between those who want to accommodate Putin and those who are on
Ukraine's side. This is neither accurate nor helpful. The journey of
Italy is especially instructive: Before Putin's invasion, Mario Draghi
was mulling deeper gas ties with Russia. He has since supported an oil
ban and backed sending heavy weapons to Ukraine despite domestic
political resistance.

[**The most dangerous scenario for the future of Europe and the global
order is one in which the Ukraine conflict sets the stage for a direct
military conflict between NATO and Russia.** There are multiple pathways
toward such an outcome, including:]{.underline}

[**NATO could decide to escalate its involvement in Ukraine** by, for
example, attempting to implement a no-fly zone or another form of direct
intervention. **For now, the United States and other NATO allies have
rejected implementing a no-fly zone---but that calculus could change if
Russia continues to escalate its bombardment of civilians.** Russia
would be forced to decide whether to back down or directly engage
alliance military forces. If it chooses the latter, the risk of an
escalating armed conflict between NATO and Russia would increase
substantially.]{.underline}

[**Russia could inadvertently strike a NATO member's territory**---for
example, through imprecise targeting or erroneous identification of
friend and foe---prompting countermeasures from the alliance. (Russia
already has attacked targets close to the Polish border.) As the Russian
military's stock of precision-guided munitions starts to dwindle, the
risk of such an accident leading to an inadvertent escalation with NATO
rises. **This scenario would see the beginnings of direct conflict,
perhaps air-to-air or air-to-ground, in border regions of Ukraine. In
turn, this could set off a tit-for-tat cycle of strike and counterstrike
leading to open hostilities.**]{.underline}

[A fearful prospect concerns the possibility that Putin has broader
designs well beyond Ukraine. If **Russian forces make rapid progress in
Ukraine** and achieve effective control over the country, Putin may turn
his attention to states that he covets as part of a desire **to
reconstitute a sphere of influence that broadly aligns with the
territory of the former Soviet Union**. The obvious candidates to test
his designs, and the resolve of NATO itself, would be the Baltic states
(all of which are members of the Alliance). Putin might harbor a belief
that NATO will back down if pushed; **NATO insists it will fight any
Russian military incursion on a member state.**]{.underline}

#### Signaling is an independent deterrent to Russia

**Grady 22** John Grady U.S., NATO in for a 'Long Haul' Conflict with
Russia, Says Polish PM John Grady, a former managing editor of Navy

Morawiecki praised the United States for its "stepped-up presence" on
NATO's eastern flank to signal to Russia that the alliance is serious
about defense. Mark Brzezinski, American ambassador to Poland, said that
in Warsaw, there are now 12,600 American soldiers on Polish bases.
Either arriving with them or coming soon are M1A2 Abrams main battle
tanks, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and F-35
Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters. "We are being tested, and Poland is
under threat," he said when explaining the reasoning behind the U.S.
troop levels there. Former ambassador to Poland, Daniel Fried, said, "we
don't know who will win" in Ukraine, but the Ukrainians "have a
reasonable chance of success." He said [**the West has to keep the
pressure on Moscow**.]{.underline} "We can't screw this up." Brzezinski
added that the movement of so many U.S. forces and so much equipment
eastward from the U.S. and other bases in Europe "allow\[s\] NATO to
stand firm." He said the American build-up and similar moves by the
United Kingdom further underscore Washington's and London's commitment
to the alliance. "Sanctions will not stop Russia today," Katarzyna
Pisarska, chair of the Warsaw Security Forum, added. "But we need more
of them" to weaken Putin, his coterie and the nation's economy over
time. Europeans also need to become more energy independent from Moscow
to cripple Putin's ability to wage war by cutting off revenues from his
largest source of foreign revenue, said Georgette Mossbacher, who also
served as an ambassador to Poland. By building liquified natural gas
terminals and exploring nuclear energy, Mossbacher said Warsaw took
these steps when Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Foreign
energy sales provided revenue for 36 percent of Russia's released 2022
budget, according to a Reuters report from earlier this year. Pisarska
said the Russian leader has been steering his country into
"self-isolation" since 2008 to consolidate power. [A large part of
self-isolation is playing out in domestic propaganda to build support
for the regime's war, which it calls a "special military operation," and
in other propaganda denigrating Ukraine, Poland and other eastern and
central European nations as ruled by Nazis. The unrelenting stream of
stories and postings on these points also makes the Russian audience
more accepting of crimes and atrocities committed by its soldiers, she
added. For years, the Russian public has been fed a steady diet that
"mass genocide has been carried out in Donbas"]{.underline} by the
Ukrainians. Days before the invasion, Putin recognized two provinces in
Donbas, where there are large numbers of Russian speakers, as
independent of Kyiv. Separatists in the two provinces, backed by the
Kremlin, have been engaged in a civil war with the Ukraine government
for eight years. The secretary general of the United Nations said
Russia's claim violated Ukraine's sovereignty and integrity as a nation.
[When the disinformation and propaganda turn outward, Pisarska said it
plays on nationalist feelings that oppose allowing more Ukrainian
refugees to enter Poland]{.underline} [and other NATO and European Union
countries.]{.underline} "You see that in the comment lines" on social
media, and this digital campaign "never stops," despite constant
monitoring by social media firms, said Marta Poslad, director of central
and eastern European public policy for Google[. "The technology is
constantly changing," and that makes removing hated-filled
disinformation even more difficult]{.underline}, she added. Despite the
Russian propaganda aimed at Poland's nationalists, Brzezinski called
Warsaw "a humanitarian superpower." He cited citizens driving to the
border to greet and help refugees and others opening their doors to
house them as examples of how ordinary Poles have responded to the
invasion. Rafal Trzaskowski, Warsaw's mayor, estimated that the Polish
capital was now housing 300,000 Ukrainian refugees.NATO and
**[the]{.underline}** [**West must be "in the fight for the long
haul**"]{.underline} **[economically, diplomatically and militarily in
supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression,]{.underline}** Poland's
prime minister said Tuesday. Although drawing the line at direct
military confrontation, Mateusz Morawiecki, in prepared remarks
delivered by a Polish chancellery official at the Atlantic Council,
said, "[it's up to us to win the battle" of protecting Ukrainian
sovereignty and blunting possible Kremlin moves against alliance
members]{.underline}. "[**Ukraine is fighting this war not only for its
security but ours**."]{.underline} He said the Feb. 24 invasion
"[**turns out to be a wake-up call" to all of Europe about President
Vladimir Putin's ambitions in eastern and central Europe**.]{.underline}
In response to the invasion, the prime minister added, "we, the
Europeans, have to step up our defense spending." Poland already meets
the NATO threshold of spending 2 percent of its gross domestic product
on security. In light of the war in Ukraine, Warsaw intends to raise
that percentage in coming years.

#### Article V doesn't check Russia mistargeting

<https://abcnews.go.com/International/natos-article-pull-us-allies-russia-ukraine-conflict/story?id=83108600>)

President Joe Biden repeatedly has said the United States will not be
sending troops to fight Russia in Ukraine, but vowed that the [U.S.
would defend its NATO allies.]{.underline} \"As I made crystal clear,
the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full
force of American power,\" he reiterated in an address Thursday. The
main goal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\'s founding in 1949
was to foster mutual assistance in response to the Soviet Union\'s
expansion in Europe. A key component of the treaty, Article 5, covers
\"collective defense,\" which means that an attack on one ally is
considered an attack on all allies. Amid the current crisis, [**Article
5 could mandate a more direct response** from the U.S. and other treaty
members if Russian aggression escalates beyond Ukraine]{.underline}.
NATO announced last week it launched its response force, a deployment of
about 40,000 troops to provide land, air and naval assistance across the
alliance. This is the first time the force has been deployed for a
\"deterrence and defence role,\" a NATO spokesperson said. Charles
Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and
professor of international affairs at Georgetown University, told ABC
News it is possible Article 5 could be invoked while the U.S. and its
allies are providing military aid to Ukraine. "Let\'s say that Russia
succeeds in toppling the government. And it then tries to occupy and
pacify Ukraine[. Assuming that the **U.S.** **and** its **allies attempt
to get arms to a Ukrainian resistance** movement, there\'s a not
in**significant risk that Russia might try to interdict that
flow**]{.underline}. [And that whether by design or by accident, an
**artillery** shell or a missile or a bomb **could land in Poland or
another NATO country**]{.underline}," Kupchan said. "And then we\'re
looking at **the [prospect of an attack on NATO territory and the
potential trigger of the Article Five collective defense
guarantee]{.underline}**[, which then **raises** the prospect of
**potential military conflict between NATO and Russia**]{.underline},"
Kupchan said. All participating countries agree to the form of
solidarity outlined in the article, making it a key component of the
alliance. While Ukraine is not a member of NATO, it borders Poland,
Hungry, Slovakia and Romania, which are members. Ukraine has been moving
toward the West and away from Russia, attempting to join both NATO and
the European Union. Kupchan said its geographical location could be
strategic during this conflict. "In the current moment, Ukraine\'s
border with four NATO countries affords it two important advantages,"
Kupchan said. "One is refugees are able to seek asylum in NATO
countries, and we\'re seeing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians head
west. And the other is that now that Ukraine\'s airspace is ...
dominated by Russia, the long border between Ukraine and NATO affords an
opportunity to continue to funnel weapons and other sources of support
to Ukraine.\" The first time Article 5 was invoked was after the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The alliance had already identified
terrorism as a risk affecting its security in 1999. In response to the
attack, NATO engaged in the fight against terrorism, launching its first
operations outside the Euro-Atlantic area to patrol the skies over the
U.S. In 2008, NATO appeared to open the door for Ukraine\'s membership
saying it would become a member of the alliance, despite a lack of
consensus between members, Kupchan said. NATO did not specify a pathway
or timeframe for Ukraine to join the alliance. "In 2008, the Bush
administration wanted to proceed with what\'s called a Membership Action
Plan for Ukraine and Georgia. And European partners were reluctant, in
part because neither Ukraine nor Georgia was ready to join NATO and
because of concern that NATO\'s enlargement to Georgia and Ukraine would
be seen as provocative in Russia," Kupchan said. "Given the lack of
consensus within NATO, the alliance agreed to issue a generic statement
that Georgia and Ukraine would become NATO members, but didn't specify a
timeframe or a pathway," Kupchan said. [Russian President Vladimir Putin
linked the current crisis to Russia\'s NATO demands, including a
guarantee that NATO will stop expanding to the East, in a video address
days before Russia invaded Ukraine. **Putin accused** the **U.S. and
NATO of ignoring his demands and blamed the West for the Ukraine
crisis**. \"\[Putin\] has **said explicitly** that he **wants to see
NATO\'s military presence** \[**reduced**\] **in the eastern flank** and
that would include the three Baltic countries, Poland, Romania, Hungary,
Slovakia, \" Kupchan said. \"He wants to see NATO pull its capability
back]{.underline}.\" \"One of the tragic dimensions of this conflict is
that the [**Russians knew full well, that Ukrainian membership in NATO
was not under consideration**.]{.underline} It was not on the table. And
NATO governments were quite explicit about that. Nonetheless, Putin
decided to invade the country,\" Kupchan said. Its unlikely Putin would
launch an attack on a NATO ally because he would be looking at a
\"full-scale war,\" he said. \"My guess is that he understands that this
is a non-starter,\" Kupchan said. In addition to NATO\'s deployment of
its response force, it also said it was deploying a quick response
brigade of 3,500 troops that could deploy on short notice while the
larger unit gathers its troops from various member nations. \"**[Our
measures are and remain preventive, proportionate and
non-escalatory]{.underline}**,\" a statement from NATO said last week.
Kupchan said it is still [**unclear how far** west **Russia will go**
into Ukraine]{.underline}. \"It\'s conceivable that there could be a
rump in Ukraine that Russia does not try to grab hold of and Western
Ukraine has generally been much more integrated into Europe, than into
Russia,\" Kupchan said.

### Solvency

#### Cooperating with Nato can effectively address solve cognitive warfare with Russia and China

[**While tensions flare up at times, NATO's success has been its
flexibility and adaptability to meet both emerging security challenges**
as well as the political demands of its members and
partners.]{.underline} [Now is a critical time]{.underline}, once again,
for NATO to answer the call, in this instance by embracing and acting
upon its important role in countering nonmilitary coercion strategies.
Traditional and nontraditional security[, economics, trade, diplomacy,
and emerging technologies can no longer be considered discretely, nor
can the interrelationships be ignored to satisfy preferences for
bureaucratic stovepiping.]{.underline} As a matter of urgency[, NATO
must help its member states and partners grapple with how to think about
authoritarian coercion strategies and develop holistic responses to
them. **Failure to do so risks the possibility of the international
system, upon which NATO allies rely, being hollowed out from
within**---commercially, technologically, socially, or otherwise---and
allies being unable to either defend themselves or contribute to the
common defense.]{.underline} Responding to political warfare is arguably
the most important geopolitical challenge of our time. NATO can, and
must, help address it.

The concept of conducting synchronized activities short of overt warfare
to achieve strategic ends has subsequently been expressed by policy
makers through terms such as "gray zone competition" and "comprehensive
coercion." **[Hybrid warfare is conceptually distinct but related to
political warfare and authoritarian coercion as it describes the
application of these hostile activities and strategies across the
conflict spectrum during times of war and peace]{.underline}**.
Political warfare refers to these coercive activities outside the
context of overt hostilities[. In the strategic calculations of both
Moscow and Beijing, political warfare appears to be a critical---if not
decisive---line of effort in hybrid warfare campaigns.]{.underline}
NATO's work to date on hybrid warfare---[coordinating with the European
Union (EU) and other partners and providing support to NATO allies on
critical areas upon request]{.underline}---represents crucially
important steps in the right direction. Further, **[NATO's Public
Diplomacy Division (PDD) counters disinformation and propaganda every
day.]{.underline}** Still, by framing NATO's response as one of hybrid
warfare, its conceptual strength may also be a fundamental limitation.

Crucially, because of the interplay between external and domestic
threats to regime survival, the activities of Beijing and Moscow are
best conceived as part of concerted, comprehensive, whole-of-society
strategies to weaken adversaries and undermine many of the key
institutions of the liberal international order. As Mahnken, Babbage,
and Yoshihara argue: "These authoritarian states practice a form of
political warfare that is notable in three respects. First, [due to
their long history of using political warfare to consolidate and
maintain Communist Party control during the 20th century, **Moscow and
Beijing continue to lean heavily on influence campaigns and view them as
a core element of their competitive toolkit.**]{.underline} Second,
because [these regimes remain deeply insecure and fearful of both
internal challengers and external threats, they often eschew restraint
and conduct a particularly aggressive form of political
warfare]{.underline}. Lastly, thanks to their centralized governments,
**[Russia and China enjoy a significant unity of effort and can engage
in highly coordinated whole-of-nation campaigns to manipulate public
opinion and political debate.]{.underline}** Considering the inherent
vulnerabilities of open democratic societies and decentralized
governments against which these efforts are utilized, these attributes
make comprehensive coercion an especially appealing strategy for
authoritarian nations.

[NATO would benefit from initiatives to prepare for, govern, and
regulate AI-related policy priorities. From developing capabilities to
building consensus on the challenges mentioned above, **NATO needs new
mechanisms to tackle emerging threats** and continuously adapt to the
dynamism of AI-led developments]{.underline} Comprehensive collective
initiatives are known to be effective in the cybersecurity field. [The
alliance should establish an AI task force to review policies and
strategic issues]{.underline}. On the policy level, [NATO should
initiate a **continuous and meaningful conversation among
decisionmakers, industry, civil society, and the scientific research
community.**]{.underline} The alliance has a long way to go in
developing algorithmic warfare capabilities and adopting an AI-enabled
C4ISR structure.14 Because most innovations in AI and robotics come from
outside the military-industrial complex, some studies have encouraged
the alliance to cooperate closely with big tech or develop ties with
promising start-ups.15The interdisciplinary conversation needs to go
beyond tech companies. [AI and other modern disruptive technologies
relate to a multitude of scientific fields, from computer science to
behavioral biology, neuroscience, psychology,]{.underline}
anthropology[, robotics, nanotechnology, and many others. **NATO nations
have relied on these scientific communities** to lead AI
innovations]{.underline}. [However, the level of **integration** of
these sectors is still significantly **below** what is
required]{.underline}, [in part because of a populist backlash against
experts among parts of the political class]{.underline}. [The
transatlantic community needs to]{.underline} build a culture to
[overcome such **communication issues** and ensure a continuous
conversation]{.underline}. NATO must test its social-cognitive and
digital-security vulnerabilities systematically. Ideally, red
teaming---in which a group adopts an adversarial point of view to
challenge an organization to improve its effectiveness or detect a major
weakness---and experimentation efforts should cover both allied
exercises and more isolated, peacetime activities to test defenses in
national security apparatuses. Inputs from the interdisciplinary and
multisectoral conversation, as well as continuous exercises, may provide
significant information for new concepts. A new international and
interdisciplinary research center, as an analytical hub and in the form
of a center of excellence, would enable effective solutions for all the
challenges mentioned above. The proposed institution would blend the
high-level techno-scientific outputs of existing NATO bodies, such as
the Science and Technology Organization, the Innovation Hub, and centers
of excellence with state-of-the-art scientific contributions from member
states and in-house experts.

**[One of the dominant challenges of contemporary statecraft is the
"cylinders of excellence" problem: the stovepiping of key policies,
activities]{.underline}**, and even worldviews by bureaucracies that,
practically speaking, limits the ability of nations to design and
implement holistic strategies to address current and emerging threats.12
To date, **[NATO allies and partners have generally muddled through on
countering political warfare with discrete efforts to identify and
counter disinformation, improve cyber defenses, and sanction Russia and
other actors in response to below-threshold attacks]{.underline}**.
**[Yet, these counterefforts have been mixed in terms of effectiveness,
scope of response, and the actors involved]{.underline}**. China and
Russia's authoritarian political warfare campaigns are neither siloed,
piecemeal, nor singular in nature. **[Accordingly, these challenges
demand a much more robust and comprehensive approach from NATO allies
and---crucially---they require a reimagined response that better
incorporates external partners]{.underline}** (including partner states,
multilateral organizations, civil society, and private sector actors).
Ultimately, political warfare is a matter that NATO allies and partners
must attend to with more urgency and intentionality lest they be at risk
of becoming the orb spider: having mindlessly, inadvertently contributed
to the design of a world that is no longer compatible with transatlantic
security and the democratic values and freedoms that are central to our
way of life. This paper argues that **[NATO has both a designated
strategic role to play due to its mandate in the 1949 Washington Treaty,
and an operational-level toolkit to utilize,]{.underline}** when it
comes to developing and implementing an urgently needed Comprehensive
Approach to countering authoritarian political warfare.13 Political
warfare can be difficult to pinpoint, as both malign and non-malign
activities can be blended together as part of an ultimately coercive
influence campaign. Political warfare is, therefore, most readily
discerned at the strategic level, where a clearer picture of overall
behaviors and trends can be aggregated and analyzed---a task that NATO
headquarters is well positioned to take on. NATO convenes not only heads
of state and government, military leaders, and ministers of defense, but
also ministers of foreign affairs and others civilian leaders 13 This
paper uses the terms political warfare, authoritarian political warfare,
coercion, and authoritarian coercion interchangeably. The key difference
this paper highlights is the distinction between hybrid and political
warfare/coercion. Parsing these terms from the overall conceptual
umbrella of "hybrid warfare" enables an analysis of what, specifically,
NATO might do to counter the political warfare components of hybrid
warfare. on a regular basis. With multiple divisions and directorates,
NATO headquarters has the ability to engage with outside actors,
including nongovernment actors and civil society**[. NATO has the
platform to further dialogue and coordinate action among multiple
stakeholders in a way that is necessary to spur cross-national and
multinational counter-political warfare efforts in the transatlantic
community. For NATO to get a handle on countering political warfare, it
can also benefit from its various partnership frameworks to learn from
and employ the capabilities of partner nations and nongovernment
actors]{.underline}**. Partners like Finland and Sweden have often led
the way on countering political warfare nationally, while partners like
Georgia and Ukraine have much experience to share. Civil society and
commercial actors also have a part to play in any proposed
counterstrategies and in developing potential solutions. A
whole-of-system approach is required to combat whole-ofsystem attacks.
NATO is well positioned to help build that holistic approach and it
should do so with greater urgency.

technologies](https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/using-machine-learning-to-detect-malign-information-efforts.html) can
provide significant opportunities in this context through enhancing
AI-based detection models by analysing potential false or misleading
information in the context of the wider rhetorical battlefields of
social media discourse. **[The development of new technical, AI-based
approaches for countering disinformation could be sufficiently \'future
proof\' in considering the potential impacts of an AI-based
counter-disinformation framework on digital human rights such as freedom
of expression online. It could also regard the adoption of AI as an
enabler of a more comprehensive response to disinformation, rather than
an isolated, overly technology-centric solution]{.underline}**.
**[Future efforts could therefore also focus on fostering societal
resilience to information threats through [digital
literacy](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA112-12.html).]{.underline}**
This could include strengthening the understanding of social media users
of the potential impacts of technologies such as AI on social media
content and strengthening their ability to recognise malign information
while engaging in informed discourse with others. The integration of AI
in counter-disinformation frameworks could go hand in hand with
comprehensive organisational capacity-building. The adoption of
more [shallow but
interpretable](https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/using-machine-learning-to-detect-malign-information-efforts.html) models
can, for example, foster institutional capacity for using AI-based
disinformation detection models. Beyond detection, institutions
particularly in the public sector might explore specialised AI training
for technical personnel to be able to leverage innovative AI-based
solutions for countering disinformation.

## 2AC China Trade-Off

#### NATO is pivoting toward checking China AI now.

[Europe's growing skepticism of China can]{.underline} also [be observed
in NATO's recent history]{.underline}. [In 2019, China was included for
the first time in a NATO statement]{.underline} -- but only in a single
sentence [saying Beijing "presents both opportunities and
challenges.]{.underline}" [By 2021, NATO's tone had
shifted]{.underline}. [A joint communique]{.underline} issued in
Brussels [said China presents "systemic challenges to the rules-based
international order." The statement also slammed China's "**coercive"
policies**, "**opaque" military** modernization, use of
"**disinformation,**" and military exercises with Russia]{.underline} in
the Euro-Atlantic area. A major reason for [NATO's more combative tone
is the Ukraine war]{.underline}, which [coincided with Beijing and
Moscow declaring a "**no limits" partnership**]{.underline}. Just weeks
before Russia invaded Ukraine, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin
met in Beijing, where they announced a broad plan to counter Western
influence around the world. Since Russia's invasion, China has attempted
to portray itself as a neutral party. But many European observers are
not convinced, noting [China has consistently defended Russia from
global criticism and instead blamed Washington for engaging in a \"Cold
War mindset\" that provoked Moscow]{.underline}. Pierre Morcos, a
visiting fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
said the Ukraine conflict has "confirmed the growing strategic
rapprochement between China and Russia." "The war in Ukraine has also
demonstrated that the Euro-Atlantic area and the Indo-Pacific region are
deeply inter-connected. A crisis in a region can have deep impacts on
the other one," he said. That explains why like-minded Asian countries
are eager to play an active role in supporting Ukraine and pushing back
against Russia, Morcos said. "I think that we will see growing
coordination and consultations between NATO and these countries in the
future notably to discuss the aftershocks of the war in Ukraine but also
exchange about China's capacities and activities," he added. Speaking at
a forum earlier this week, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg
insisted the alliance does not regard China as an adversary. However, he
suggested the coming summit would result in a statement acknowledging
"China poses some challenges to our values, to our interests, \[and\] to
our security." [China has responded angrily to NATO's eastward focus. At
a Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry briefing Thursday, spokesperson Wang
Wenbin accused NATO of engaging in a "**highly dangerous"**]{.underline}
[effort to create hostile blocs in Asia.]{.underline} "NATO has already
disrupted stability in Europe," he said. "It should not try to do the
same to the Asia-Pacific and the whole world."

#### Link turn - China developing cognitive warfare now with the intention to control the highest decision-makers' will.

The United States and its allies may have built the Maginot Line of the
information age. But just as the German armored units broke through the
Ardennes Forest in ways the French did not expect, so the Chinese
People's Liberation Army may break through the United States'
information-age arsenal, no matter how cutting-edge, if the technology
remains tied to the operational concepts of a previous era. [China is
developing a new concept of warfare]{.underline}, which they call
[intelligentized]{.underline} warfare (智能化战争). First mentioned by
the government in 2019, [it is an innovative military concept with a
**focus on human cognition**]{.underline}, which Beijing intends to use
to bring Taiwan under its control without waging conventional
warfare[.]{.underline} However, only a few of the many studies on
intelligentized warfare have focused on this aspect of human cognition.
[Chinese thinkers have clearly stated that the core]{.underline}
operational [concept]{.underline} of intelligentized warfare [is to
directly **control the enemy's will**.]{.underline} The idea is to [use
AI to]{.underline} directly [control the will of the **highest
decision-makers, including the president**,]{.underline} members of
Congress, and combatant commanders[, as well as citizens]{.underline}.
"Intelligence dominance" or "control of the brain" will become new areas
of the struggle for control in intelligentized warfare, putting AI to a
very different use than most American and allied discussions have
envisioned[.]{.underline} This article analyzes the essence of China's
intelligentized warfare, its possibilities, and limitations, and
suggests measures that the United States and its allies should take.

#### Link turn -- U.S. and allied AI capabilities key to forecasting China offensive. 

**Takagi, '21**, \[Koichiro Takagi is a visiting fellow with Hudson
Institute's Japan Chair. His research areas include future warfare,
cognitive warfare, and the relationship between emerging technologies

[The United States and its allies should analyze intelligentized
warfare]{.underline} [more to avoid surprise attacks]{.underline} in
future wars. [They should also designate the cognitive arena as a **new
operational arena**]{.underline}, along with land, air, sea, space, and
cyberspace, [to raise awareness and invest resources]{.underline}.
Furthermore, it is necessary to consider how to win the "battle of
narratives" to counter the manipulation of public opinion in wartime.
[Future warfare comes from innovative theory and **cannot** be derived
from existing weapons.]{.underline} In the 1920s, when Germany developed
the concept of blitzkrieg warfare, the country did not have any tanks,
as the Treaty of Versailles banned them. Even in 1939, when Germany led
the blitzkrieg, less than 10 percent of the German troops were armored
forces. Most of China's colossal military still has outdated equipment,
and only a tiny percentage of its troops have modern intelligence
equipment. The vision of future warfare lies not in existing equipment,
but in military thought[. The United States and its allies have to
evaluate hypotheses about the future, **rigorously and
effectively.**]{.underline} Regardless of whether China's
intelligentized warfare succeeds or not[, it is important to pay
attention to the cognitive domain in warfare and consider the means to
win in it.]{.underline} The idea of directly influencing human cognition
is not new, but with the development of AI, it may be more feasible.
Intelligentized warfare uses AI to intimidate the enemy's
decision-makers and manipulate public opinion. Dealing with the direct
manipulation of public opinion requires a complex operation. There are
many studies about the manipulation of public opinion by China and
Russia in peacetime, but there have been few analyses on wartime
efforts. In warfare, both sides will use their own narratives. For
example, in the case of the Taiwan-China conflict, the Chinese narrative
will be something like, "These are China's domestic problems that other
countries should not be involved in." In contrast, the narrative of the
United States and its allies will likely be about the defense of
democratic society. Many sub-narratives will support these narratives.
There will be a battle of the narratives to determine which narratives
will penetrate and gain support in the international community. [China's
intelligentized warfare is a far cry from the information age wars that
have been waged in the past and is not simply the use of AI or unmanned
weapons systems in warfare. Its feasibility is unknown and may have been
overestimated, out of political necessity. But with its goals of
**influencing human cognition** directly and controlling the enemy's
will, it is a revolutionary idea]{.underline}

#### Not unique and only risk of link turn - China is using cognitive warfare now on Taiwan

**Huang '21**, \"China Using 'Cognitive Warfare' Against Taiwan,
Observers Say,\" VOA,

A Taipei think tank and observers in Taiwan say [China is trying to
influence residents with "cognitive warfare," hoping to reverse
opposition to Beijing's desired takeover of Taiwan so it can be
accomplished without having to go to war]{.underline}. Taiwanese
attitudes have been drifting away from the mainland, especially among
the younger generation, whose members see themselves "born independent"
with no ties to China. [China's effort]{.underline}, these analysts say,
[includes tactics ranging from military intimidation and propaganda to
misinformation spread by its army of online trolls in a bid to
manipulate public opinion.]{.underline} They say the complexity and
frequency of the effort puts Taiwan on a constant defensive. "Its
ultimate goal is to control what's between the ears. That is, your brain
or how you think, which \[Beijing\] hopes leads to a change of
behavior," Tzeng Yi-suo, director of the cybersecurity division at the
government-funded Institute of National Defense and Security Research in
Taipei, told VOA. Cognitive warfare is a fairly new term, but the
concept has been around for decades. China has never stopped trying to
deter the island's separatists, according to Tzeng, who wrote about the
Chinese efforts last month in the institute's annual report on China's
political and military development. [Liberal democracies such as Taiwan,
that ensure the free flow of information, are vulnerable to cognitive
attacks by China]{.underline}, while [China's tightly controlled media
and internet environment makes it difficult for democracies to
counterattack]{.underline}, according to Tzeng. [China's campaign has
intensified since the outbreak of COVID-19, using official means such as
flying military jets over Taiwan, and unofficial channels such as news
outlets, social media and hackers to spread misinformation. The effort
is aimed at dissuading Taiwan from pursuing actions contrary to
Beijing's interests]{.underline}, the report said. [China has used these
tactics to attack Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's administration,
undermine support for democracy and fuel Taiwan's social tensions and
political divide,]{.underline} it said. [The South China Situation
Probing Initiative, for example, a project run by Najing University in
China, has disseminated information about Chinese military activities in
the region through its Twitter account,]{.underline} but some of the
[posts have been found to be false, apparently aimed at intimidating
Taiwan\'s public and weakening Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party
government's resolve]{.underline}, according to the report. Tzeng said
China's efforts didn\'t work in Taiwan's presidential election last
January, when Tsai won a landslide victory. The island's growing
anti-China sentiments -- seem further strengthened by disapproval of
China's brutal suppression of pro-democracy Hong Kong protests. China
"set out to \[actively\] promote the island's reunification with the
mainland, its identity as ethnic Chinese or favorable views toward the
CCP \[Chinese Communist Party\]. But now all it can hope for is to curb
Taiwan's \[growing\] pro-independence sentiments" -- a trend Beijing has
found it difficult to contain, he said. Tzeng added that he believes
[China is biding its time and experimenting with new tactics, which it
hopes will succeed in influencing the island's future
elections.]{.underline} For example, the report said that China's
Communist Party is believed to have played a role in hacking Tsai's
office in May to discredit her. Reporters covering her office at the
time claimed to have received minutes of internal meetings from an
anonymous email account, which accused the president of corruption.
Tsai\'s administration responded by saying that the documents had been
doctored and contained fabricated content. Taiwan should, Tzeng said,
stay alert and establish a comprehensive fact-checking system to prevent
fake news and misinformation from subverting public opinion. Taiwan
should also "work with regional and global liberal democracies to
establish a common defense mechanism" as China's influencing attacks
have a global outreach and aren't limited to Taiwan. They constitute the
most serious challenge facing democratic societies today, Tung Li-wen,
former head of the ruling DPP's China affairs department, wrote in a
2019 essay. Chinese citizen journalist and blogger Zhou Shuguang, who
now lives in Taiwan, said many Chinese have taken to the internet to
spread China's narrative. Two groups of such online promoters of China's
narrative are known as "Little Pink" and "50 Cent Party," The groups, he
said, have formed China's sizable army of online trolls to spread fake
news, for example, rumors about Tsai's academic background. Despite
repeated clarifications, many kept circling rumors that the president's
1984 doctorate degree from the London School of Economics was fake. A
2016 study, led by Harvard University data scientist Gary King, found
that 50 Cent Party produced 488 million "fake" social media posts a year
to distract other internet users from news and online discussions
painting the Communist Party in a negative light.

#### US already focused on China -- Hot topic at 2022 NATO Summit

China in a crisis?,\" POLITICO,
<https://www.politico.eu/article/g7-conundrum-push-china-crisis/> \--MV

[**For China, the main concerns** about **western countries\'
pronouncements in the days ahead** focus on what\'s brewing at next
week\'s NATO summit,]{.underline} rather than any tough talk at the G7.
**[For the first time ever, NATO will consider China to be a challenge
in its upcoming 10-year blueprint,]{.underline}** the Strategic Concept,
to be adopted next week. [**According to NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg**, the 30 leaders in the military bloc **will \"address
China and the consequences for our security\" at the Madrid
summit**]{.underline}. \"I expect that allies will state that China
poses some challenges to our values, to our interests or to our
security. And this, of course, has an impact also on how NATO should
react in a more competitive world,\" Stoltenberg told POLITICO this
week. In a last-minute appeal to head off that kind of designation, Wang
Lutong, head of European affairs at China\'s Foreign Ministry, wrote
that China \"is not an adversary to NATO and should not be regarded as
one. China poses no challenge, and its rise is for delivering better
lives to the Chinese people, and has brought economic opportunities to
the world, including NATO members.\" China\'s close alliance with Russia
during the Ukraine war is, however, already posing big questions about
how rich Western nations should deal with the broader G20 format, in
which high-income nations engage with a broader group representing the
wider global economy, including China, Russia, Mexico and Indonesia.
Russia\'s presence has raised the prospect that some Western nations
could boycott to avoid being in the same room as Putin. But a senior EU
official said that the a widening divide between the G7 nations and
developing economies made the G20 all the more important. "The G20 takes
on all the more relevance as a bridge to constituents who may not have
an identical world view," the senior official said. \"The worst thing we
could do is break that format. \... Diplomacy is not about having just
cozy chats with your like-minded friends."

#### US already focused on measures against Chinese AI

Amy **Hudson, 7-13-2021,(** news editor of Air Force Magazine) \"DOD\'s
Artificial Intelligence Efforts Gain Momentum as US, Allies, and

\--MV

The Defense Department's push to operationalize artificial intelligence,
which leaders say will change the way the military conducts war but not
the laws of war, is gaining momentum. [**More than 600 AI efforts are in
progress across the department**, "significantly more than just a year
ago," Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III told a live audience at The
National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence's Global
Emerging Technology Summit in Washington, D.C.,]{.underline} on July 13.
AI is "one of the top technology priorities" in the department's \$112
billion research, development, test, and evaluation budget request for
2021---the largest RDT&E request ever, he added. "In today's department,
innovation cannot be an afterthought. It is the ballgame," Austin said.
"As President Biden has noted, we're going to see more technological
change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50. And we know that
some of our competitors think that they see an opening, but we're
determined ... to develop and dominate the products and technologies of
the future." All the conference speakers, which included senior members
of Congress and the U.S. national security team as well as leaders from
India, Japan, Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, NATO, and the
European Union, agreed that China is the pacing threat. China already
has stated it intends to be globally dominant in AI by 2030. Sen. Mark
Warner (D-Va.), chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,
opened the full-day conference with a stark warning: "China has reared a
generation of innovative technologists, and let's not underestimate the
enormous skills and talents of the Chinese people," he said. "In many
areas, we're now seeing Chinese competitors launch both products and new
technologies in advance of all Western competitors." Warner said China
is expanding its global influence by offering other authoritarian
regimes a chance to monitor dissidents. [**"China**, I believe, **is
hoping to control the next generation of technological innovation** and
digital infrastructure and hopes to impose its values on those
developments,"]{.underline} Warner said. "All of this again, I think,
puts into question principles of transparency, accountability,
sovereignty, \[and\] free, fair, and reciprocal relations." [**That's
why the Defense Department is focused on responsible artificial
intelligence, which Austin said is the culmination of "cutting-edge
technology" and "timeless values.**"]{.underline} He emphasized that the
U.S. will not choose between the two. National Security Adviser Jake
Sullivan agreed, saying the U.S. and its allies and partners need to
"muster the will, the energy, and the resources to alter the course of
the digital revolution." [He outlined **three waves to this
revolution**. **The first was based on the premise** that technology
would favor democracy and human rights, while the second was the
authoritarian counter to that revolution. "So, the question before us
today is whether we have the will and determination to usher in that
third wave of this digital revolution---whether we can reboot and ensure
that critical and emerging technologies work for, not against, our
democracies and our security,"]{.underline} Sullivan said. "I believe
that third wave is within our reach, if across party lines, across the
public and private sectors, and across borders to allies and partners,
we invest in our enduring advantages, we promote our shared values, we
protect our technological ecosystem, and we mobilize and organize the
rules of the road for the 21st century with our partners and allies."
Austin said the Defense Department is "working with other like-minded
friends to advance global norms grounded in our shared values," noting
DOD leaders meet several times a year with representatives from 15
allied and partner nations on the topic. He said he expects that number
to "mushroom, going forward." [Austin said artificial intelligence is a
"transformative technology" that will require new processes, policies,
and procedures. Last year, DOD adopted ethical principles for AI
development and use and in June it announced the creation of the Rapid
Defense Experimentation Reserve, which "helps us get promising tech
across the so-called 'Valley of Death' and into new prototypes,
capabilities, and concepts," Austin said. The Department also recently
launched a new AI and data acceleration initiative aimed at harnessing
data at scale and speed. "We're going to compete to win, but we're going
to do it the right way. We're not going to cut corners on safety,
security, or ethics ...]{.underline} We don't believe for a minute that
we have to sacrifice one for the other," Austin said.

#### US Presence in China not as large as though

Van **Jackson, 10-26-2021**,( senior lecturer in international relations

Reached a Dead End,\" Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/09/us-southeast-asia-china-biden-economic-strategy-geopolitics/>
\--MV

In December 2021, the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific coordinator,
Kurt Campbell, detailed the shape of U.S. thinking about China and Asia
during a conference on Indo-Pacific security. He hit all the familiar
notes: the importance of alliances, weapons sales to counter China, the
centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and
the optimistic view that Sino-U.S. relations could be at once
competitive and stable. In any other era, such talk might have been
comfort food for regional experts and policymakers. But absent from
Campbell's remarks at the conference, which was organized by Australia's
Lowy Institute, was any meaningful statement about political
economy---the single aspect of statecraft most crucial to the
Indo-Pacific region's stability. [It is in this arena of policy that
**China has done more to displace the United States than in any other**,
and it remains the glaring hole in Washington's attempts to craft an
Indo-Pacific policy.]{.underline} When pressed on this by his host,
Campbell acknowledged that defense initiatives were not enough. But he
could mention no concept, policy, or action to suggest economics was
anything more than a throwaway gesture in a speech. Grand references to
a forthcoming "economic framework" that would be "cutting-edge" lacked
all specifics and stated no purpose other than wanting the United States
to "design" the region's standards. To the extent Campbell's remarks
reflect Washington's view of Asia, they are at once modestly reassuring
and highly troubling. Reassuring because Campbell's bland rhetorical
restraint is a refreshing departure from the volatility and
pugnaciousness of the Trump administration. [Troubling, however, because
**the ideas powering U.S. President Joe Biden's Asia policy are as bland
as the rhetoric itself**]{.underline}. U.S. policy toward the world's
most important region is no more than a mashup of the residual inertia
from Trump's military-first Asia policy with a revival of then-U.S.
President Barack Obama's well-intentioned but ill-fated "pivot to Asia,"
which also had a heavily militarized agenda. [Consequently, **the United
States is misallocating its attention and influence relative to what
would actually benefit the region most**.]{.underline} Economic policy,
not defense policy, is the only way to address the interrelated problems
of development, pandemic recovery, and adaptation to climate
change---issues that plague policymakers throughout Asia and threaten to
derail the region's peace and prosperity. [This is precisely **the
trouble with U.S. engagement in Asia to date: The United States has no
economic strategy for the region**]{.underline}---at least not since
Obama's ill-fated attempt to negotiate a new U.S.-Asia trade agreement,
the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And it is unrealistic to expect any
economic strategy beyond the free-trade pabulum so sharply at odds with
U.S. domestic political constraints. First, Washington must obviously
prioritize economic statecraft and stop thinking with its missiles. [It
is clear from **the way U.S. leaders talk about their country's role in
Asia that trade, aid, finance, and development are not as privileged in
their minds as the Pentagon;**]{.underline} economic equality outside
U.S. borders does not even appear to register as a problem needing
attention. If that does not change, the United States will continue to
place itself on the wrong side of trends---including defense spending,
naval expansion, nuclear modernization, and missile proliferation---that
are turning the region into a powder keg, which serves no one except the
defense industry. Second, Washington needs an economic policy for
Asia---one that tries to do actual good for the region instead of
furthering only abstract U.S. interests. And there is much the United
States can do to do right by Asia. For instance, U.S. officials could
use the United States' privileged position in the global economy to
negotiate various forms of debt relief on behalf of low- and
middle-income countries in the region that have been hit particularly
hard by the pandemic, such as the Philippines and Malaysia. (The United
States did this for Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion.) Washington could
also grant these countries preferential trade access, which would be a
boon to Asia's export-dependent economies.

## 2AC Diplomacy CP

#### Diplomatic solution doesn't work

**Snider '22** (Ted Snider, a regular columnist on U.S. foreign policy
and history at Antiwar.com, "Is the US hindering much-needed diplomatic
efforts?," report, issue, 04/09/22,
https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/04/09/is-the-us-hindering-much-needed-diplomatic-efforts/)-KN

[Years prior to the war, when diplomatic avenues were open to prevent
war, the United States already seemed to be setting up
roadblocks.]{.underline}

In [**2014**, **Ukrainian President** Viktor Yanukovych was **faced
with** the choice of **economic alliance** with the European Union **or
with Russia**]{.underline}. In a country that was nearly evenly split,
the choice of either partner was divisive and dangerous. But there was a
way out of the dilemma: **[compromise was possible]{.underline}**.
Ukraine doesn't have to choose, Putin offered. **[Both Russia and the EU
could work economically with Ukraine.]{.underline}**

**[There didn't need to be a dangerous dilemma]{.underline}**. But
Washington and the EU rejected Putin's peace offering. The late Stephen
Cohen, Professor Emeritus of Politics and director of Russian Studies at
Princeton, reminded in a 2014 interview that "it was the European Union,
backed by Washington, that said in November to the democratically
elected president of a profoundly divided country, Ukraine, '[You must
choose between Europe and Russia]{.underline}.'" **[There was a
diplomatic solution to the catalyst of today's crisis. The U.S. rejected
it.]{.underline}** That rejection led to the coup that led to the civil
war between Western Ukraine and the Donbas region in the east and set
the stage for the current crisis. In 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky was
elected on a platform that featured making peace with Russia and signing
the Minsk Agreement. The Minsk Agreement offered autonomy to the Donetsk
and Lugansk regions of the Donbas that had voted for independence from
Ukraine after the coup. It offered the most promising diplomatic
solution.

**[Facing domestic pressure]{.underline}**, though, Zelensky would need
U.S. support. He did not get it and, in the words of Richard Sakwa,
**[Professor of Russian and European Politics at the University of Kent,
he was "thwarted by the nationalists.]{.underline}**" Zelensky stepped
off the road of diplomacy and refused to talk to the leaders of the
Donbas and implement the Minsk Agreements. Having failed to support
Zelensky on a diplomatic solution with Russia, Washington then failed to
pressure him to return to the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Sakwa told this writer that, "as for Minsk, neither the U.S. nor the EU
put serious pressure on Kyiv to fulfill its part of the agreement."
Though the U.S. officially endorsed Minsk, Anatol Lieven, senior
research fellow on Russia and Europe at the Quincy Institute for
Responsible Statecraft, told this writer, "they did nothing to push
Ukraine into actually implementing it."The Ukrainians gave Zelensky a
mandate for a diplomatic solution. **[Washington did not support or
encourage it.]{.underline}**

[Having inhibited diplomatic solutions prior to the war, the United
States has been absent from negotiations since the invasion last
month.]{.underline} **[The empty U.S. seat at the table is
striking.]{.underline}** Sakwa said that, "in the Cold War the U.S.
would have taken the lead on diplomacy in a situation of the sort that
we have today. Instead, now **[the U.S. is clearly not interested in
peace negotiations]{.underline}** --- it is waiting for a Russian
defeat, however many Ukrainian lives are lost in the process."

In **[the direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, and even in the
Turkish mediated talks, the United States seems
invisible.]{.underline}** Ambassador Chas Freeman, who served 30 years
as a U.S. diplomat, told me that "**[it is the opposite of statecraft
and diplomacy that the U.S. is not involved in any
negotiations."]{.underline}**

that an invasion of Ukraine would almost certainly be preceded by
renewed cyberattacks on Ukraine's electric grid, its communications
systems and its government ministries. All of those systems have been
Russian targets in the past six years. Ukraine has often been President
Vladimir V. Putin's testing ground for Russia's arsenal of cyberweapons.
"We have been warning for weeks and months, both publicly and privately,
that cyberattacks could be part of a broad-based Russian effort to
destabilize and further invade Ukraine," the White House said in a
statement announcing Ms. Neuberger's arrival at NATO headquarters in
Brussels. After speaking with the North Atlantic Council, NATO's main
policy body, she will go on to Poland, where she will meet with Baltic
officials responsible for cyberdefense. Ms. Neuberger will tell NATO
members that over the last few years they [have **witnessed** a lot of
**cyberskirmishes**]{.underline}, but no cyberwar. She will say,
according to a White House statement, "that [the kinds of disruptive or
destructive cyberactions possible during a conflict **are different in
scope, kind and sophistication from** the types of incidents we have
seen during **peacetime**."]{.underline} In January, hackers brought
down dozens of government websites in Ukraine, and Microsoft warned that
it had detected a dangerous form of malware in government and private
computer networks in the country. The U.S. government has been quietly
sending teams into Ukraine in recent weeks to help shore up the
country's defenses, and it is preparing to do the same with NATO
countries on the alliance's eastern flank. But those experts are
reporting back to Washington that [there is **relatively little they can
do** to fundamentally harden Ukraine's networks in a few
weeks.]{.underline} Ukraine poses some unique cyberdefense challenges.
The electric grid is still connected to Russia's own electric supply
network, a huge vulnerability that Ukrainian officials vowed to fix
after attacks that turned out the lights in 2015 and 2016. Those
incidents were later blamed on Russian hackers, though it was never
clear if they were working at the government's behest. Ukraine is
scheduled to conduct some long-planned experiments in coming weeks that
involve disconnecting from Russian electric supply networks and linking
to other European power grids. But the effort is preliminary, and
American officials doubt it will be of much help in any near-term
confrontation with Russia. There are also concerns about how easy it
would be to shutter the Ukrainian internet and communications throughout
the country. A blog post this week from the Atlantic Council noted that
by slicing a single undersea cable in the Kerch Strait that was
installed in 2014 by Russia's state-owned telecommunications company,
Russia could disrupt much of Ukraine's internet traffic --- but at the
cost of also cutting off Crimea and other Russian-speaking territory.
"It could create panic in the rest of Ukraine and limit the
international community's visibility into further Russian actions,"
wrote Justin Sherman, a fellow at the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the
Atlantic Council. Such an action would echo a move taken by Russia when
it annexed Crimea nearly eight years ago and would be "well in line with
the Kremlin's willingness to accept some costs to invade and forcibly
exert control over Ukraine." Many of these scenarios have been mapped
out by United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, and
they have been part of war game exercises overseen by the White House[.
Ms. Neuberger's trip is largely **focused on how to coordinate a NATO
response should Russia again attack** parts of the power grid in
**Ukraine or take out communications** in an effort to destabilize the
government of President Volodymyr Zelensky.]{.underline}

## 2AC Feminist IR

### No solvency

#### Recent literature published about Fem IR is fundamentally flawed by ignoring significant events. This means that the alternative cannot solve the affirmative.

**Crilley '18** (Rhys Crilley, any qualifications, "International
relations in the age of post-truth politics," March 2018,
https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rhys-Crilley-2/publication/323645901_International_relations_in_the_age_of\_%27post-truth%27_politics/links/5c7d09df299bf1268d36ba2f/International-relations-in-the-age-of-post-truth-politics.pdf)

Undoubtedly, many of these things have played a role in creating the
conditions of possibility for the 'post-truth' present. Yet while
interesting, these authors' analyses are [rendered **problematic by
their definition of 'post-truth' as something novel and
contemporary**.]{.underline} This is not to say that the authors present
ahistorical accounts of recent events. Rather, it is to suggest that
[the **understanding of 'posttruth'** politics itself---collectively
**deemed to be the victory of emotion over reason in contemporary
politics and society---is flawed**]{.underline}. This is because there
has been [**no sudden shift** towards people making decisions and voting
with their hearts rather than their heads. **Emotions have always been
importan**t in politics, economics and society. Feminists, critical
theorists and others outside the mainstream of academic inquiry have
argued so for decades]{.underline}.1 What is new is the recognition,
both within the study of these respective fields and within wider public
discourse, that emotions matter. And it is not that emotions matter at
the expense of rationality. Seeing them in opposition to one another is
to construct a false dichotomy that ignores the ways in which emotions
are pervasive and interlinked with rationality.2 Subsequently, what
marks the 'post-truth' age is not an actual shift in politics from an
age of reason to an age of emotion, but an analytical one whereby the
likes of d'Ancona, Ball and Davis---and the popular psychology, economic
thinking and political studies that they draw on---have begun to realize
that emotions matter. The point is underlined by their engagement with
psychology. The dynamics of confirmation bias, the prioritization of an
in-group at the expense of an out-group and the notion that humans are
more convinced by narratives than by statistics, are important. They
are, however, not new. In the social sciences, and indeed in
International Relations (IR), many critical theorists, feminists,
post-colonial theorists and post-structuralists have highlighted the
importance of these phenomena throughout history. While integrating the
insights of multiple disciplines into accounts of the political present
is important, it also has to be recognized that those insights can help
explain the past. Claims about psychology suddenly helping us understand
an epochal shift from a world of truth to one of 'post-truth' are
therefore to be approached with caution. They do not tell us about the
specifics of the modern-day moment, but instead they illuminate general
tendencies of human psychology. This is not to say that human psychology
is universal across time and space, but it is to [**point out that what
is lacking in the authors' accounts of psychology as a cause of
'post-**truth' politics is a sense of what exactly, if anything**, has
recently changed** in **how people think about politics**.]{.underline}
If, as Davis asserts, 'we are willing accomplices to bullshit peddlers'
(p. 158), one is left wondering how, exactly, this is a novel
development that has led to a shift towards 'post-truth' politics.
Ultimately, these concerns create further limitations within these
works. The first is an avoidance of contextual specifics when talking
about a condition of 'post-truth' politics instead of engaging with the
complexities of events such as Brexit and the election of Trump. The
second is the proclamation that [we, collectively, are to blame for
buying into 'post-truth' politics, rather than fully interrogating how
**political actors are at fault for strategically lying and playing on
people's prejudices**]{.underline}. As a consequence, the authors pay
scant attention to the role of racism, sexism and xenophobia in
'post-truth' politics. Although the suggestions that the new age of
'post-truth' politics has been ushered in because of our psychology is
unconvincing, the sections of these books that do engage with the
historical and contextual specifics leading up to the events they are
concerned with are much better. This is where Ostrovsky's work is
strongest. The invention of Russia is a detailed history of the
evolution of Russian media after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
Vladimir Putin's rise to power, and how television has come to be a key
tool for the Kremlin. As such, it provides insights into Putin's
approach to television and media coverage, and more specifically into
how he has used the media as a scapegoat in the wake of national
disasters, such as the sinking of the Kursk submarine. Then, Putin
proclaimed to relatives of the dead submariners: 'Television? They are
lying! They are lying! They are lying!' (p. 299). Ostrovsky also
documents how television and the media have come to be interwoven with
Russian military activities, labelling the Russian--Georgian conflict of
2008 as 'Russia's first fully televised war' (p. 321). Although the
addition of a new preface does attempt to bring the original 2015 book
up to date with the current climate of 'the new Cold War', the book only
touches on certain issues that are worthy of more attention. Ostrovsky
suggests that Putin emerged as Russia's president as a result of the
public's loss of trust in and disillusionment with the pro-western elite
in the wake of the 1998 Russian financial crisis and the NATO bombing of
Belgrade. He compares these with recent events in the UK and the US,
noting that Russia's turn to Putin was 'a manifestation of the
frustration and distrust of many people with their own establishment'
(p. xviii). This observation is important because it serves to place
specific events in context and highlights the role that they, and
politics more broadly, have played in causing the emergence of a
so-called 'post-truth' condition. Ball's work is at its strongest when
discussing how the current media ecology has led to the rise of Trump
and Britain's vote to leave the European Union. He deftly highlights how
traditional media business models are failing, and draws attention to
how PR companies, tech companies and major news sites all play a role in
creating a broken media environment whereby almost everyone profits from
'outright fake news or articles of very dubious quality' (p. 212). This
culture of sensationalism and a focus on gaining clicks and views,
alongside the public's dissatisfaction with mainstream media reports
reflecting the status quo, are indeed important contextual factors that
have contributed to Brexit and Trump (Posttruth: how bullshit conquered
the world, p. 225). In a similar vein, Davis is right to point to the
rise of marketing, PR, spin and disinformation in leading to the events
of 2016. Yet there is a tension between his suggestions that there have
been 'genuine changes in the way public discourse was conducted' (p.
xiii) and his claims that a deep-seated culture of bullshit (that is
hard to change) led to the ruptures of 2016. Oddly, for a book that
draws heavily on insights from different academic fields, the chapter on
'culture and norms' does not engage with cultural studies or the study
of culture. D'Ancona points out how trust in politicians and the
establishment has been undermined by crisis after crisis in prominent
public institutions. He suggests that bank bailouts after the financial
crisis of 2008, the MPs' expenses scandal, child sex scandals at the BBC
and the phone hacking scandal at the News of the World have led to 'an
age of institutional fragility' (p. 41) where people no longer trust
political, economic and social institutions. These events no doubt
played a role in determining how people felt towards, and ultimately
bought into, the anti-establishment narratives of the Trump and Brexit
movements, and they warrant more discussion than is present in
d'Ancona's book. This is because, like Davis, d'Ancona also struggles
when it comes to discussing culture. However, this is not because he
ignores theorists of it, but because he dedicates a whole chapter to
blaming them for causing the 'post-truth' politics of today. The notion
that post-modern and post-structural philosophers 'paved the way for
post-truth' (Post-truth: the new war on truth and how to fight back, p.
96) has become a rather tedious refrain. This argument is based on a
caricature of post-structural thought and fails to reflect on the
fundamental fact that the likes of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida,
Judith Butler and Jean Baudrillard are not advocating for politi- cians
to lie and play fast and loose with the truth. Rather, what these
post-structuralists, and the critical scholars of IR that they
influence, are interested in is how truths are mobilized. For example,
when Baudrillard was writing about the Gulf War, he was not encouraging
politicians and the military to provide a sanitized view of conflict to
the media. He was critiquing how such a sanitized media representation
of the war led to western audiences failing to fully comprehend the
violence taking place in Iraq.3 As such, Baudrillard was challenging
politicians', militaries' and the media's deployment of untruths, and
was essentially critiquing the 'post-truth' view of the Gulf War. In
fact, one of the key takeaways from Baudrillard and other
post-structural philosophers is that we should always be sceptical of
claims made by politicians, the media and businesses---a point that is
remarkably similar to d'Ancona's suggestion that in order to combat
'post-truth' politics 'we must all become editors: sifting, checking,
assessing what we read' (p. 113). Furthermore, the critical ethos
presented by post-structuralists, as well as their associated
methodological tools of deconstruction and genealogy, can be used to
address and challenge the issues most apparent in 'post-truth'
politics---the lies, xenophobia and misogyny.4 These books also suffer
in their tendency to suggest that a collective 'we' are to blame for the
'post-truth' politics of Brexit and Trump. This argument leads the
authors to focus on human psychology and blames us, the public, for the
current ills of political discourse. As Davis argues: 'we live in a
post-truth age because significant numbers of gullible people are taken
in by fake news and false narratives that are put about by those who
play to our disposition to believe' (p. 125). Indeed, Britain's vote to
leave the EU and the election of Donald Trump would not have happened if
people didn't turn out and vote for them. However, such a view that
people did so because they are 'gullible' or psychologically disposed to
believe bullshit falls short not only because it is perhaps borderline
insulting, but also because it lets those who strategically stretched
the truth off the hook. Each author does suggest that the events of
Brexit and Trump happened because of their respective campaigns and the
narratives they strategically deployed---whether that be claims about
the UK's National Health Service spending painted on the side of a big
red bus or Trump's promise to 'drain the swamp'. However, what would
benefit these works is a deeper engagement with the strategies, actions
and narratives of these campaigns and how they created the effects they
did. It is high time that people stopped suggesting that 'post-truth'
politics and 'fake news' can be explained by broad generalizations about
psychology and our propensity to believe lies. Instead, the focus should
be on the role of actors who intentionally deceive for political
purposes, and the people who have actually been influenced by them. This
brings us to the authors' recommendations about countering 'post-truth'
politics. Ball provides a detailed range of sensible suggestions for
politicians, the media, and for readers and voters. By far his most
convincing recommendations concern the media. He argues that media
literacy needs to be taught in schools and that politicians should work
to bring targeted social media advertising into the public eye.
D'Ancona's claim that tech companies should 'acknowledge their
responsibility as the world's most powerful distributors of information'
(p. 117), and act on this, is also important. In comparison, Davis's
recommendations seem rather broad, and in suggesting that the media
'should do its job with the usual rigour and set out the facts as it
always would' (p. 289) he not only provides a rosetinted view of the
media (one wonders if he has ever seen a copy of the Daily Mail or
watched Fox News), but he also fails to reflect on the role that the
media have played in the Brexit and Trump campaigns. Trump
simultaneously used the media to great effect in garnering coverage of
his campaign while also latching on to people's anger that the
mainstream media failed to reflect their views and life experiences.
Herein lie the implications of these works for scholars and
practitioners of global politics. The most serious of these include a
need to engage with the everyday lived experiences of people, pay
greater attention to the role of racism, sexism and xenophobia in global
politics and interrogate the role of the media in our analyses---and how
this is being transformed by developments of digital technology. For
d'Ancona, Ball and Davis, people's motivations for being
antiestablishment are often obscured by generalizable claims about
psychology. D'Ancona does highlight how real events such as the
financial crisis have led to people losing trust in politicians and
public institutions, but more could be said about the importance of
Iraq, propaganda and anti-establishment sentiment. One recent study
found that in the US, one of the clearest indicators of a community's
support for Trump was the number of people from that community who had
died fighting for the US in the 'war on terror'.5 Studies like this make
clear that actual politics---such as the propaganda, decisions and
actions of past governments---are implicated in the rise of populist
movements. IR as a discipline must place greater focus on understanding
the everyday lived experiences of people, and take these as a serious
source of inquiry. Such an approach would help to make sense of the
actual reasons behind people's support for Brexit and Trump beyond the
generalizations drawn from pop psychology presented in these books. In
addition, [these books **engage only in a limited way with blatantly
important societal ills such as racism, sexism and xenophobia** and
their role **in** both **Brexit and the election of
Trump**]{.underline}. Research has demonstrated that the most consistent
evidence for support of populist movements is cultural values, and that
antiimmigrant sentiment as well as right-wing cultural beliefs explain
why people support the populism of Trump and Brexit.6 But the authors of
these works on 'post-truth' barely recognize this, let alone address
what can be done about it. [Others have been much more attentive to the
role that racism and misogyny have played in movements such as the
alt-right,7 and it is **imperative that scholars of IR pay greater
attention to the insights of scholars working in the areas of
postcolonial and feminist theory**.]{.underline} Not only do they help
understand how and why racism and sexism serve political interests in
the way that they do, but they have also spent decades grappling with
many of the issues which seem to be suddenly so important. [**The
starkest omission from these books on 'post-truth' politics is any
engagement with gender.**]{.underline} This is rather unforgivable in
any work that discusses the election of Donald Trump who, of course, ran
against the first female US presidential candidate nominated by a major
party, Hillary Clinton. [Neither d'Ancona, nor Ball nor Davis explores
in detail how sexism and misogyny were at the heart of Trump's rhetoric
and how he was still elected despite being caught on tape bragging about
sexual assault.]{.underline} **[Scholars of IR should avoid being so
gender-blind, and would be wise to place gender at the heart of their
analysis of Trump, Brexit and other populist 'post-truth'
phenomena.]{.underline}** Indeed, if emotion is at the heart of the
'post-truth' condition, as d'Ancona, Ball and Davis all suggest, they
would do well to remember that 'feminist scholarship has a very long
history with "the emotional"'8 , and is therefore a valuable source of
insight. Finally, these works on 'post-truth' politics all demonstrate
that [IR needs to take the media and popular culture
seriously.]{.underline} There are well-developed literatures on
political communication and on popular culture and world politics, which
are perhaps no longer on the margins of IR scholarship. As Ostrovsky
makes clear, Trump and Putin have many differences, yet 'both men are,
in their own way, a product of the media rather than of traditional
politics, and both are TV personalities' (p. xviii). This highlights the
importance of recognizing how politics is mediatized: a process whereby
politicians and institutions increasingly adopt media logics.
Furthermore, since the mid-2000s, social media platforms, algorithms and
targeted advertising have reconfigured power, legitimacy and authority
in global politics and, in the wake of 2016, it is clear that they need
to be integrated into our studies. On the whole, the works reviewed here
are worth reading. While certain claims---such as the main argument that
we have transitioned from an age of reason to an age of emotion---rest
on shaky foundations, they are important as they provide an insight into
how journalists themselves think about the current ills that face their
industry and the world they write about. [The books **struggle to
articulate both what is novel about the current 'post-truth' moment, and
what caused it**.]{.underline} D'Ancona's, Ball's and Davis's works
would benefit from a more sustained engagement with the contextual
histories of the events they purport to cover---as Ostrovsky does.
However, Ostrovsky also could benefit from a further interrogation of
the political present in Russia and elsewhere. Perhaps it is too harsh
to expect these journalistic works to reflect a level of critical
engagement one might hope to find in academic inquiry, yet what they
lack---such as a sustained discussion of sexism and gender, particularly
in the context of Trump's election victory---is jarring. That said,
these books do highlight several important issues IR scholars should
take up for further research. Davis and d'Ancona are optimistic about
addressing the problems of contemporary politics, suggesting that 'the
truth will out' (Posttruth: the new war on truth and how to fight back,
p. 149) and that 'good sense normally prevails in the end' (Post-truth:
why we have reached peak bullshit and what we can do about it, p. 302).
Such platitudes are misplaced in the face of populism informed by racism
and sexism. If, as some suggest, IR and security studies are facing a
crisis of ethics, we would be wise to place the ethical imperative of
our work on challenging the underlying global social and political ills
that make the victories of xenophobes and misogynists possible.
