**[Security Cooperation]{.underline}** The US military shapes the global
security environment and safeguards US interests through military
engagement with foreign militaries. Since the fall of the Soviet Union,
threats to US security have shifted from a two-power major theater war
to regional, ethnic, and religious conflicts. To counter these threats,
the US military found it necessary to interact with foreign militaries
using special operations forces which are best suited to handle these
new relationsbuilding efforts.11 Therefore, in 1991 Congress granted DOD
direct authority for special operations forces to train with foreign
militaries.12 Seeing benefit from building these relationships, the US
military continued to promote its engagement strategy which shifted
towards working with new and emerging democracies. In 1998 DOD
institutionalized planning for military engagements by requiring
geographic combatant commanders to publish Theater Engagement Plans.13
Military engagement maintained a narrow, regional focus until former
[Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld introduced Security Cooperation Guidance
in 2003 to unify guidance and prioritize department
efforts]{.underline}. Today's DOD guidance reflects changes since 2005
requiring all combatant commanders to publish engagement plans and
outlining [a broad range of peacetime activities]{.underline} that [fall
under DOD security cooperation efforts]{.underline}. [These include all
DOD funded engagements with foreign militaries such as combined
exercises, training, and education, military-to-military contacts,
humanitarian assistance, and information operations]{.underline}.
**[Security cooperation also includes security assistance programs which
fall under State Department funding and policy direction]{.underline}**,
[namely]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales and Foreign Military
Financing ([FMS/FMF]{.underline}) and International Military Education
and Training ([IMET]{.underline}).14 After 9/11 security cooperation
efforts grew rapidly mostly due to DOD activities in Iraq and
Afghanistan, but threats from global terrorism necessitated significant
changes be made to US security assistance efforts.

### No Solvency

#### Diplomatic assistance causes political backlash\-\--that wrecks solvency

**Kralev '20** (Nicholas, Executive Director @ the Washington
International Diplomatic Academy (WIDA), "Why Politicians Don't Trust
Diplomats,"
<https://diplomaticacademy.us/2020/06/14/kralev-why-politicians-dont-trust-diplomats/)//BB>

[So politicians' lack of trust in the Foreign Service is based on
perceptions that are largely divorced from reality]{.underline}. Like
most Americans, [they know very little about our diplomats]{.underline}.
In a challenge to such a conclusion, previous administrations have often
pointed to entrusting a few senior Foreign Service officers, including
William J. Burns and Thomas R. Pickering, with top State Department
posts as an example of the respective president's reliance on
professionals. That may speak of these officers' capabilities, but it
doesn't make up for sidelining or ignoring the service as an
institution. At least Bush and Obama understood that having held a
prominent position under an administration of the other party is also a
part of a career diplomat's job. For example, Bush appointed R. Nicholas
Burns ambassador to NATO and later undersecretary of state, even though
Burns had been State Department spokesman under Clinton. And Obama
appointed Victoria Nuland an assistant secretary of state despite her
earlier role as a close adviser to Dick Cheney, Bush's vice president.
In contrast, Trump has retaliated against officers who held key
positions during the Obama administration. [Politicians' **decades-long
distrust** of the Foreign Service has significantly undermined the
authority of the **professionals and ultimately weakened U.S. diplomacy
globally**]{.underline}. [The very real danger that there won't be
enough properly trained diplomats to **restore America's clout in the
future worries us**]{.underline} at the independent Washington
International Diplomatic Academy. So much so that, although we were set
up to offer short-term courses, we've decided to start a one-year
post-graduate practical training program for people who aspire to become
diplomats --- the first such effort outside government. Our instructors,
all former senior Foreign Service officers, have a lot to teach.

### Department of State Fails

#### The Department of State is structurally inept and incapable at effective diplomacy

**Zeya** and Finer **20**, \*American diplomat who has served as the
Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human
Rights in the Biden Administration since July 2021, \*\*American
journalist and diplomat who serves as Deputy National Security Advisor
under National Security Advisor (Uzra and Jon, "Revitalizing the State
Department and American Diplomacy," *Council Special Report* No. 89)//BB

It has become an article of faith among policymakers that principled
American leadership has waned but remains in demand around the world.
Moreover, America's network of international relationships is its
foremost strategic asset, even as the agency charged with advancing U.S.
interests through diplomacy---[the Department of State]{.underline}
(DOS)--- [has fallen into a deep and sustained period of
crisis]{.underline}. However, there is a third framing assumption: that
the current crisis offers an opportunity to address this predicament and
revitalize American diplomacy. Despite the decades-long failure to
implement essential reforms---and even in the face of sustained
hostility from the current administration---diplomacy remains the best
tool the United States has to advance its foreign policy interests. [The
role of the State Department has received heightened attention amid the
onslaught it has suffered under]{.underline} the Donald J.
[Trump]{.underline} administration, [which has treated American
diplomats and diplomacy with a mix of neglect and disdain. But many of
the challenges facing the DOS have existed for **decades**]{.underline}.
[Deficits in diversity, institutional culture, and professionalization
are **endemic** to the State Department as an institution, and a
diminished policy role for career officials persisted under previous
administrations]{.underline}. Too often, leaders from both major parties
have taken public support for U.S. leadership in the world for granted
without making a strong enough case to the American public for why it is
essential. Concrete steps can, and should, be taken solely through
executive action in the first year of an administration committed to
revitalizing American diplomacy, with thought to cementing change
through legislation. [The most pressing challenges facing the State
Department include a twenty-first-century policy environment that has,
in some priority areas, evolved beyond the core competencies of most
Foreign and Civil Service officers and an institution **hollowed out**
by three years of **talent flight**, **mired** in excessively layered
structure, and **resistant to reform**]{.underline}. Perhaps most
important, [they include the multigenerational challenge of a diplomatic
workforce that falls woefully short of reflecting the diverse country it
serves, particularly at the senior-most ranks, compromising its
effectiveness and fostering a homogeneous and risk-averse culture that
drives out rather than cultivates fresh perspectives]{.underline}. [The
State Department today risks losing the "war for talent," not only to
the private sector but increasingly to other government agencies, due to
inflexible career tracks, self-defeating hiring constraints, and a lack
of commitment to training and professional development]{.underline}.
Finally, [DOS is **hampered** by Congress's failure over many years to
pass authorizing legislation, leading to budgetary pressures and
diminishing DOS's status in the hierarchy of national security agencies
rather than reinforcing the nation's paramount foreign policy
institution]{.underline}.

#### State Department assistance fails

**Sadler 21**, Senior Fellow for Naval Warfare and Advanced Technology
at Heritage, and Janae Diaz, Fall 2020 member of the Young Leaders
Program at The Heritage Foundation ("Don't Shift Security Cooperation to
State Department," *The Heritage Foundation*,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/dont-shift-security-cooperation-state-department)//BB>

[America spends billions each year on security cooperation and
assistance programs, but the results do not match the
investment]{.underline}. To help improve efficiencies, [the Center for
American Progress recently proposed consolidating **all** these programs
within the State Department]{.underline}. [**That would be a big
mistake**, because it would minimize the Pentagon's role in shaping and
directing security assistance and, ultimately, the program's military
objectives would be subordinated to State Department
interests]{.underline}, such as judicial reform and humanitarian
programs. Those are not the values by which such security assistance
programs should be solely judged. [Security sector assistance programs
deliver arms, military training, and other defense-related services to
allies and partner nation governments]{.underline} via grants, loans,
credit, cash sales, or leasing. [By definition, these programs
**should** prioritize national security. To this end, reforms should
enhance joint State and Defense authorities so programs are evaluated in
terms of America's national strategic goals]{.underline}.

### AT: Militarization Impact

#### No link to militarization -- plenty of checks. 

**Early '11** (Billy, Lt Col, USAF, "IMPLICATIONS OF THE MILITARIZATION
OF US FOREIGN POLICY THROUGH SECURITY ASSISTANCE," A Research Report
Submitted to the Faculty, Air War College, 16 February 2011,
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1018707.pdf)

**[Conclusion]{.underline}** [Building the capacity of foreign
military]{.underline} forces to counter terrorism and conduct stability
operations [is DOD's strategy to promote the security of the United
States.]{.underline}63 DOD's direct authority to train and equip
military partners promotes US national security, but it risks moving the
United States toward a more militarized US foreign policy. [Risks are
mitigated because the State Department's ability to implement US foreign
policy remains strong through its close relationship with DOD and direct
involvement in security assistance programs]{.underline}. [Congress also
remains engaged with yearly debate over the appropriate whole of
government approach to promoting US security interests]{.underline}.
**[Militarization]{.underline}** of US foreign policy through security
assistance exists but [**is managed** through the continuous interaction
and teamwork between DOD, the State Department, and
Congress]{.underline}.

### Military Cooperation Good

#### Military-to-military contacts are necessary to build trust and avoid miscalculation

**Ebitz 19**, graduate of the Federal Bureau of Investigation National
Academy, and holds master's degrees in Military Studies, from the U.S.
Marine Corps Command and Staff College, and Strategic Studies, from the
U.S. Marine Corps War College (Amy, "The use of military diplomacy in
great power competition," Brookings Institute,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/02/12/the-use-of-military-diplomacy-in-great-power-competition/)//BB>

[Within the main elements of national power]{.underline} (diplomacy,
informational, military, and economic, or DIME), [the military is often
considered the last resort. However, the U.S. military has been a **key
player** in, for instance, the **spread of democracy, building partner
countries' strength through military-to-military
relationships**]{.underline} (including in the form of bi- and
trilateral exercises to support standing Operation Plans, NATO, the
United Nations, and Theater Security Cooperation), [personnel exchange,
and humanitarian assistance operations. Through these efforts, among
others, the U.S. military helps to carry out the diplomatic mission of
the United States]{.underline} ([military diplomacy paved the way for
NATO]{.underline}, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization,
[for instance]{.underline}). [When military units participate in
bilateral or multilateral exercises]{.underline} with other countries,
for example, [the purpose is several-fold: The interaction **increases
interoperability** between the militaries, provides for **cultural
exchange and understanding**, and offers an opportunity to expand each
nation's capabilities while exercising potential contingencies. The
importance of military diplomacy in foreign engagement is to **build
dialogue** that may facilitate **further communication and, during a
crisis, avoid confusion between cultures**]{.underline}.

#### [Military-first]{.underline} should be the objective for all security assistance

**Sadler 21**, Senior Fellow for Naval Warfare and Advanced Technology
at Heritage, and Janae Diaz, Fall 2020 member of the Young Leaders
Program at The Heritage Foundation ("Don't Shift Security Cooperation to
State Department," The Heritage Foundation,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/dont-shift-security-cooperation-state-department)//BB>

[Another report published this month by the Center for a New American
Security rightly suggests that security assistance]{.underline} in the
Middle East [should be guided by strategy and applied narrowly to
military effects]{.underline}. However, the report's recommendations are
limited to counterterrorism activities and a strategy of deprioritizing
the Middle East in favor of the Indo-Pacific. If limiting security
assistance to [**military** **purpose**]{.underline}s would make
programs more effective in a region of waning emphasis, it stands to
reason that this [**should be the formative basis** for all security
assistance programs, especially when strategy calls for increased
investment in the security capacities of partner nations]{.underline}.
[Reforms to security assistance should push the agencies in this
direction, encouraging---or compelling---State to design its programs in
closer **coordination with the Pentagon** and in support of Defense
Department's operational needs, such as improving military forward
presence, wartime resilience and interoperability]{.underline}.

### AT: Diplomatic Cred Impact

#### No diplomacy impact and too many alt causes

C. Richard **Neu 13**, senior economist at the nonprofit, nonpartisan
RAND Corporation, 2/8/13, "U.S. \'Soft Power\' Abroad Is Losing Its
Punch,"
<http://www.rand.org/blog/2013/02/us-soft-power-abroad-is-losing-its-punch.html?utm_campaign=rand_socialflow_twitter&utm_source=rand_socialflow_twitter&utm_medium=socialflow>

This is a small example of what may be a troubling trend: [[America\'s
fiscal predicament]{.mark} and the]{.underline} seeming [inability of
its political system to resolve these matters [may
be]{.mark}]{.underline} [[taking a toll on]{.mark} the instruments of
[U.S. "soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}[" [and]{.underline}]{.mark} on
[the]{.underline} country\'s [[ability to shape international
developments]{.mark} in ways that serve American interests]{.underline}.
The most potent instrument of U.S. soft power is probably the simple
size of the U.S. economy. As the biggest economy in the world, America
has a lot to say about how the world works. But the economics profession
is beginning to understand that high levels of public debt can slow
economic growth, especially when gross general government debt rises
above 85 or 90 percent of GDP. The United States crossed that threshold
in 2009, and the negative effects are probably mostly out in the future.
These will come at a bad time. The U.S. share of global economic output
has been falling since 1999---by nearly 5 percentage points as of 2011.
As America\'s GDP share declined, so did its share of world trade, which
may reduce U.S. influence in setting the rules for international trade.
And it\'s not just the debt itself that may be slowing GDP growth.
Economists at Stanford and the University of Chicago have demonstrated
that uncertainty about economic policy---on the rise as a result of
political squabbling over U.S. fiscal policy---typically foreshadows
slower economic growth. [[Investors]{.mark} may be [grow]{.mark}ing
[skittish about U.S.]{.mark} government [debt levels]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the [disordered]{.mark} state of U.S. [fiscal
policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline}. From the beginning of 2002, when U.S.
government debt was at its most recent minimum as a share of GDP, to the
end of 2012, the dollar lost 25 percent of its value, in price-adjusted
terms, against a basket of the currencies of major trading partners.
This may have been because investors fear that the only way out of the
current debt problems will be future inflation. [[The dollar
has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[given up]{.mark} a bit of its
[dominance]{.mark} as the preferred currency]{.underline} for
international reserves among advanced economies. And [the renminbi
appears to have replaced the dollar as the "reference currency" for most
of East Asia]{.underline}. (The good news is that in recent years U.S.
banks have increased their share of deposits from foreigners, mostly at
the expense of banks in London.) More troubling for the future is that
[private domestic investment]{.underline}---the fuel for future economic
growth---[shows a strong negative correlation with government debt
levels]{.underline} over several business cycles dating back to the late
1950s. Continuing high debt does not bode well in this regard. But
perhaps the worst consequences of U.S. debt are actions not taken.
[[U.S.]{.mark} international [leadership has been
based]{.mark}]{.underline}, in part, [[on
contributions]{.underline}]{.mark}---political and financial---[[to
major institutions and initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark} ---International
Monetary Fund, World Bank, General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (and
later World Trade Organization), NATO, North America Free Trade
Agreement, the Marshall Plan, and so on. These served U.S. interests and
made the world better. But [what have we done lately?]{.underline} The
[[Doha]{.underline}]{.mark} round of trade negotiations has
[[stalled]{.underline}. [Ditto]{.underline}]{.mark} efforts at
coordinated international [action on [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Countries of the Arab Spring need
rebuilding]{.underline}. [[Little progress is apparent on]{.mark} the
[T]{.mark}rans[p]{.mark}acific [P]{.mark}artnership]{.underline}, a
proposed new free-trade area. And [[warnings from the
U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} treasury secretary [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
his [European counterparts about]{.underline} the dangers of failing to
resolve [the fiscal crisis in [the eurozone met]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[with public rebukes]{.underline}]{.mark}: Get your own house in order
before you lecture us. [Have [U.S. fiscal problems undermined
America\'s]{.mark} self confidence and [external credibility to the
extent that it can no longer lead]{.mark}?]{.underline} And [what about
unmet needs at home]{.underline}---healthcare costs, a foundering public
education system, deteriorating infrastructure, and increasing
inequality? [[A strained fiscal situation]{.mark} that limits resources
for action and [absorbs so much political energy]{.mark}]{.underline}
[cannot be helping with any of these matters]{.underline}. But [without
progress on such things]{.underline}, [[what becomes of the social
cohesion necessary for unified]{.mark} [action abroad or]{.mark} the
[moral authority to lead]{.mark} other nations by example?]{.underline}
America\'s fiscal predicament is serious. The problem has become obvious
in the last few years, but it has been building for decades, largely the
result of promises of extensive social benefits without a corresponding
willingness to pay for them. Putting U.S. government financing on a
sustainable path will require painful adjustments over a number of
years---increased government revenue and painful reductions in
government outlays, almost certainly including outlays for defense and
international affairs. [During the necessary period of fiscal adjustment
and constrained government resources]{.underline}, [[U.S. international
influence may decline yet further]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### Single instances of action do not change international perceptions of the US.

**Fettweis 8** (Christopher -- professor of political science at Tulane,
Credibility and the War on Terror, Political Science Quarterly, Winter)

Since Vietnam, [[scholars have been]{.mark} generally [**unable to
identify** cases in which]{.mark} high [credibility helped the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[achieve its
goals]{.mark}. The shortterm aftermath of [the Cuban Missile
Crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [[did not
include]{.underline}]{.mark} a string of [Soviet
[reversals]{.mark}]{.underline}, or the kind of benign bandwagoning with
the West that deterrence theorists would have expected. In fact, the
perceived reversal in Cuba seemed to harden Soviet resolve. As the
crisis was drawing to a close, Soviet diplomat Vasily Kuznetsov angrily
told his counterpart, \"You Americans will never be able to do this to
us again.\"37 Kissinger commented in his memoirs that \"the Soviet Union
thereupon launched itself on a determined, systematic, and long-term
program of expanding all categories of its military power \.... The 1962
Cuban crisis was thus a historic turning point-but not for the reason
some Americans complacently supposed.\"38 The reassertion of the
credibility of the United States, which was done at the brink of nuclear
war, had few long-lasting benefits. The Soviets seemed to learn the
wrong lesson. [[There is]{.mark} actually [**scant evidence** that other
states ever learn]{.mark} the right [lessons. Cold War history contains
**little reason** to believe that]{.mark} the [credibility]{.mark} of
the superpowers [had very much effect on their ability to **influence
others**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the last decade, [[a series
of]{.mark} major [scholarly studies]{.mark} have [cast further **doubt**
upon the **fundamental assumption**]{.mark} of interdependence across
foreign policy actions]{.underline}. Employing methods borrowed from
social psychology rather than the economics-based models commonly
employed by deterrence theorists, Jonathan [Mercer argued that threats
are far more independent than is commonly believed and]{.underline},
therefore, [that [reputations are **not likely** to be formed on the
basis of **individual actions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.39 While
policymakers may feel that their decisions send messages about their
basic dispositions to others, most of the evidence from social
psychology suggests otherwise. [[Groups]{.mark} tend to
[interpret]{.mark} the [actions]{.mark} of their rivals [as situational,
**dependent** upon the constraints of **place** and
**time**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, [[they are not likely to form
**lasting impressions**]{.underline}]{.mark} of irresolution [[from
**single**]{.mark}, independent **[events]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Mercer
argued that the interdependence assumption had been accepted on faith,
and rarely put to a coherent test; when it was, it almost inevitably
failed.40

### AT: Democracy/HR Impact 

#### Democracy doesn't solve war \-\-- increases hostility.

Libraries\]

[Conclusion]{.underline}

[It has become a **stylized fact** that dyadic democracy lowers the
hazard of armed conflict]{.underline}. While [the Democratic Peace has
faced many challenges]{.underline}, we believe [the most significant
challenge has come from the argument that [the pacifying effect of
democracy is **epiphenomenal to territorial issues**]{.mark},
specifically the external threats that they pose]{.underline}. [This
argument sees the lower hazards of armed conflict among democracies
**not** as a product of shared norms or institutional structures, but as
a **result of settled borders**]{.underline}. Territory, though, remains
only one geo-political context generating threat, insecurity, and a
higher likelihood of armed conflict. Strategic rivalry also serves as an
environment associated with fear, a lack of trust, and an expectation of
future conflict. [[Efforts to assess democratic pacifism]{.mark} have
largely **[ignored rivalry]{.mark}** as a context conditioning the
behavior of democratic leaders]{.underline}. To be sure, research
demonstrates rivals to have higher probabilities of armed conflict and
democracies rarely to be rivals. But [fundamental to the Democratic
Peace is the notion that even in the face of difficult security
challenges and salient issues, dyadic democracy will associate with a
lower likelihood of militarized aggression. But the presence of an
**external threat**, be that threat disputed territory or strategic
rivalry, may be the key mechanism by which [democratic leaders]{.mark},
owing to **audience costs**, **resolve** and **electoral pressures**,
**[fail to resolve problems nonviolently]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[This study has sought a ''hard test'' of the Democratic Peace by
testing the conditional effects of joint democracy on armed conflict
when external threat is present]{.underline}. We test three measures of
threat: territorial contention, strategic rivalry, and a threat index
that sums the first two measures. [For robustness checks, we use two
additional measures of our dependent variable: fatal MID onset, and
event data from the Armed Conflict Database]{.underline}, which can be
found in our Online Appendix. As most studies report, democratic dyads
are associated with less armed conflict than mixed-regime and autocratic
dyads. In every one of our models, when we control for each measure of
external threat, joint democracy is strongly negative and significant
and each measure of threat is strongly positive and significant. Here,
liberal institutions maintain their pacific ability and [external
threats clearly increase conflict propensities]{.underline}. However,
[[when we test the **interactive relationship** between democracy
and]{.mark} our measures of [external threat, the pacifying
effect]{.mark} of democracy [is **less visible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Park and James (2015) find some evidence that when faced with an
external threat in the form of territorial contention, the pacifying
effect of joint democracy holds up. This study does not fully support
the claims of Park and James (2015). [Using a longer timeframe, [we
find]{.mark} more [**consistent evidence** that]{.mark} when faced with
an external threat, be it territorial contention, strategic rivalry, or
a combination, **democratic [pacifism does not
survive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What are the implications of our study?
First, while it is clear that we do not observe a large amount of armed
conflict among democratic states, if we organize interstate
relationships along a continuum from highly hostile to highly friendly,
we are probably observing what Goertz et al. (2016) and Owsiak et al.
(2016) refer to as ''lesser rivalries'' in which ''both the frequency
and severity of violent interaction decline. Yet, the sentiments of
threat, enmity, and competition that remain---along with the persistence
of unresolved issues---mean that lesser rivalries still experience
isolated violent episodes (e.g., militarized interstate disputes),
diplomatic hostility, and non-violent crises'' (Owsiak et al., 2016).
Second, our findings show that [[the pacific benefits of **liberal
institutions** or]{.mark} externalized [**norms** are **not**]{.mark}
always [able to lower the likelihood of]{.mark} armed [conflict]{.mark}
when faced with external threats, whether those hazards are disputed
territory, strategic rivalry, or a combination of the two]{.underline}.
The structural environment clearly influences democratic leaders in
their foreign policy actions more than has heretofore been appreciated.
[[**Audience costs**, **resolve**, and **electoral pressures**]{.mark},
produced from external threats, [are **powerful forces**]{.mark} that
are [present even in jointly democratic
relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} forces [make it
difficult for leaders to **trust one another**, which **inhibits
conflict resolution** and facilitates persistent
**hostility**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It does appear]{.underline}, then,
[that there is a **limit** to the Democratic Peace]{.underline}.

#### Democracy is [resilient]{.underline}, but it solves [nothing]{.underline}.

**Doorenspleet 19** Renske Doorenspleet, Politics Professor at the
University of Warwick. \[Rethinking the Value of Democracy: A
Comparative Perspective, Palgrave Macmillan, p. 239-243\]

[The value of democracy has been **taken for granted**]{.underline}
until recently, but this assumption seems to be under threat now more
than ever before. As was explained in Chapter 1, democracy's claim to be
valuable does not rest on just one particular merit, and scholars tend
to distinguish three different types of values (Sen 1999). This book
focused on the instrumental value of democracy (and hence not on the
intrinsic and constructive value), and investigated the value of
democracy for peace (Chapters 3 and 4), control of corruption (Chapter
5) and economic development (Chapter 6). [This study was based on a
search of **an enormous academic database**]{.underline} for certain
keywords,6 [then pruned **the thousands of articles**]{.underline} down
to a few hundred articles (see Appendix) [which **statistically
analysed** the connection between the democracy and the four expected
outcomes]{.underline}. The frst fiding is that [[**a reverse wave away
from democracy** has not happened]{.underline}]{.mark} (see Chapter 2).
Not yet, at least. [Democracy is not doing worse than
before]{.underline}, at least not [in comparative
perspective]{.underline}. While it is true that there is a dramatic
decline in democracy in some countries,7 [[a general trend downwards
cannot yet be detected]{.underline}]{.mark}. It would be better to talk
about 'stagnation', as not many dictatorships have democratized
recently, while democracies have not yet collapsed. Another fnding is
that the instrumental value of democracy is very questionable. The feld
has been deeply polarized between researchers who endorse a link between
democracy and positive outcomes, and those who reject this optimistic
idea and instead emphasize the negative effects of democracy. [There has
been **'[no consensus']{.mark}** [in **the quantitative literature** on
whether democracy has]{.mark}]{.underline} instrumental value which
leads some [**[beneficial general outcomes]{.mark}**. Some scholars
claim there is a consensus, but they only do so by ignoring **a huge
amount of literature** which rejects their own point of
view]{.underline}. After undertaking a large-scale analysis of carefully
selected articles published on the topic (see Appendix), [this book can
conclude that the connections between democracy and expected benefts are
**not**]{.underline} as **[strong]{.underline}** as they seem. Hence, we
should not overstate the links between the phenomena. [[**The overall
evidence** is **weak**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Take the expected impact of
democracy on peace for example. As Chapter 3 showed, the study of
democracy and interstate war has been a fourishing theme in political
science, particularly since the 1970s. However, there are four reasons
why democracy does not cause peace between countries, and why the
empirical support for the popular idea of democratic peace is quite
weak. [**Most statistical studies** have not found **a strong
correlation** between democracy and **interstate war** at **the dyadic
level**]{.underline}. They show that [[there are other---**more
powerful**---explanations for war]{.underline}]{.mark} and peace, and
even that [the impact of democracy is **a spurious one**]{.underline}
(caveat 1). Moreover, [[the theoretical foundation of the democratic
peace hypothesis is **weak**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and [the causal
mechanisms are **unclear**]{.underline}]{.mark} (caveat 2). In addition,
[democracies are not]{.underline} necessarily **[more peaceful in
general]{.underline}**, and [the evidence]{.underline} for the
democratic peace hypothesis [at **the monadic level** is
**inconclusive**]{.underline} (caveat 3). Finally, the process of
[democratization is **dangerous**]{.underline}. Living in a
democratizing country means living in a less peaceful country (caveat
4). With regard to peace between countries, we cannot defend the idea
that democracy has instrumental value. [Can the]{.underline}
(instrumental) [value]{.underline} of democracy [be found in the
prevention of civil war?]{.underline} Or is the evidence for the
opposite idea more convincing, and does democracy have a 'dark side'
which makes civil war more likely? The findings are confusing, which is
exacerbated by the fact that different aspects of civil war (prevalence,
onset, duration and severity) are mixed up in some civil war studies.
Moreover, defining civil war is a delicate, politically sensitive issue.
Determining whether there is a civil war in a particular country is
incredibly diffcult, while measurements suffer from many weaknesses
(caveat 1). Moreover, [there is **no linear link**: civil wars are
**just as unlikely** in democracies as in dictatorships]{.underline}
(caveat 2). Civil war is most likely in times of political change.
[Democratization is **a very unpredictable**, **dangerous process**,
increasing the chance of civil war significantly]{.underline}. Hybrid
systems are at risk as well: the chance of civil war is much higher
compared to other political systems (caveat 3). More specifcally, both
the strength and type of political institutions matter when explaining
civil war. However, [the type of political system (e.g. democracy or
dictatorship) is **not the decisive factor at all**]{.underline} (caveat
4). Finally, democracy has only limited explanatory power (caveat 5).
[Economic factors are far more significant than political
factors]{.underline} (such as having a democratic system) when
explaining the onset, duration and severity of civil war. To prevent
civil war, it would make more sense to make poorer countries richer,
instead of promoting democracy. [Helping countries]{.underline} to
[democratize would **even be a very dangerous idea**]{.underline}, as
countries with changing levels of democracy are most vulnerable, making
civil wars most likely. It is true that there is evidence that the
chance of civil war decreases when the extent of democracy increases
considerably. The problem however is that most countries do not go
through big political changes but through small changes instead; those
small steps---away or towards more democracy---are dangerous. Not only
is the onset of civil war likely under such circumstances, but civil
wars also tend to be longer, and the confict is more cruel leading to
more victims, destruction and killings (see Chapter 4). A more
encouraging story can be told around the value for democracy to control
corruption in a country (see Chapter 5). Fighting corruption has been
high on the agenda of international organizations such as the World Bank
and the IMF. Moreover, the theme of corruption has been studied
thoroughly in many different academic disciplines---mainly in economics,
but also in sociology, political science and law. Democracy has often
been suggested as one of the remedies when fghting against high levels
of continuous corruption. So far, the statistical evidence has strongly
supported this idea. As Chapter 5 showed, dozens of studies with broad
quantitative, cross-national and comparative research have found
statistically signifcant associations between (less) democracy and
(more) corruption. However, there are vast problems around
conceptualization (caveat 1) and measurement (caveat 2) of 'corruption'.
Another caveat is that [democratizing countries are **the poorest
performers** with]{.underline} regard to [controlling
corruption]{.underline} (caveat 3). Moreover, it is not democracy in
general, but particular political institutions which have an impact on
the control of corruption; and a free press also helps a lot in order to
limit corruptive practices in a country (caveat 4). In addition,
democracies seem to be less affected by corruption than dictatorships,
but at the same time, there is clear evidence that economic factors have
more explanatory power (caveat 5). In conclusion, more democracy means
less corruption, but we need to be modest (as other factors matter more)
and cautious (as there are many caveats). The perceived impact of
democracy on development has been highly contested as well (see Chapter
6). Some scholars argue that democratic systems have a positive impact,
while others argue that high levels of democracy actually reduce the
levels of economic growth and development. Particularly since the 1990s,
statistical studies have focused on this debate, and [the empirical
evidence is **clear**: [there is **no direct impact** of
democracy]{.mark} on development]{.underline}. Hence, both approaches
cannot be supported (see caveat 1). The indirect impact via other
factors is also questionable (caveat 2). Moreover, [[there is **too much
variation**]{.mark} in]{.underline} levels of economic
[growth]{.underline} and development [among the dictatorial
systems]{.underline}, and there are huge regional differences (caveat
3). Adopting a one-size-ftsall approach would not be wise at all. In
addition, in order to increase development, it would be better to focus
on alternative factors such as improving institutional quality and good
governance (caveat 4). There is not suffcient evidence to state that
democracy has instrumental value, at least not with regard to economic
growth. However, future research needs to include broader concepts and
measurements of development in their models, as so far studies have
mainly focused on explaining cross-national differences in growth of GDP
(caveat 5). Overall, [[**the instrumental value of democracy**
is]{.underline}]{.mark}---at best---tentative, or---if being less
mild---[**[simply non-existent]{.mark}**. Democracy is **not necessarily
better** than **any alternative form of government**. With]{.underline}
regard to [many]{.underline} of the expected [benefts---such as less
war, less corruption and more economic development---democracy **does
deliver, but so do nondemocratic systems**]{.underline}. High or low
levels of democracy do not make a distinctive difference. Mid-range
democracy levels do matter though. Hybrid systems can be associated with
many negative outcomes, while this is also the case for democratizing
countries. Moreover, other explanations---typically certain favourable
economic factors in a country---are much more powerful to explain the
expected benefts, at least compared to the single fact that a country is
a democracy or not. The impact of democracy fades away in the powerful
shadows of the economic factors.8 . Moreover, other
explanations---typically certain favourable economic factors in a
country---are much more powerful to explain the expected benefts, at
