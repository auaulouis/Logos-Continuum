The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, in
its [final report to Congress and the Biden
administration](https://www.nscai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Report-Digital-1.pdf) last
year, warned artificial intelligence will soon become "weapons of first
resort in future conflicts.") CL

That warning, as well as the commission's recommendation for the federal
government to increase spending on basic research and development,
remains urgent for the U.S. to remain AI-ready in the coming years, even
though the commission no longer remains. The commission disbanded in
October 2021, but many of its leading experts have shifted to a
private-sector entity, the [Special Competitive Studies
Project](https://www.scsp.ai/) (SCSP). The name stems from the
Rockefeller Special Studies Project, launched in 1956 by Nelson
Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger following the Soviet Union's launch of
the satellite Sputnik. SCSP chief executive officer Ylli Bajraktari,
NSCAI's former executive director, said Rockefeller and Kissinger saw
their project as a way for the U.S. to further define its national
objectives when it came to defense, security and foreign policy. "This
is not the first time that we're seeing technology playing a critical
role in great power competition," Bajraktari said. That mission, he
added, remains urgent in the present day. Unlike the Cold War era,
however, when [the federal government played a leading role in research
and development**, the private sector is now the driving force in R&D
spending.**]{.underline} Bajraktari said [**the private sector's R&D
spending has obvious impacts on society and the public**, but also holds
major implications for national security.]{.underline} "That's why this
is such a critical time, because of the diffusion of power, the
diffusion of technologies and accessibility. Not just the United States
government has access to these technologies. Anybody can purchase these
kinds of capabilities off the shelf or online. This is a new momentum in
how conflicts are waged, how geopolitics will be formed," Bajraktari
said. To prepare for the next era of great power competition, Bajraktari
said the federal government will need to increase its level of spending
on basic R&D. [NSCAI in its final report urged Congress to double
federal R&D spending for AI each year, until it reached \$32 billion in
fiscal 2026. The Biden administration**, [in its fiscal 2023 budget
request](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ap_18_research_fy2023.pdf),
proposes increasing the federal R&D budget to more than \$204 billion, a
28% increase from FY 2021 enacted levels**.]{.underline} Part of that
funding would support new and existing National AI Research Institutes.
These institutes bring federal, state and local agencies together with
the private sector, nonprofits and academia to tackle AI research and
workforce development challenges. "If we don't outmaneuver and not
out-innovate China, we will not be in the lead position when it comes to
these emerging technologies. The lead position in emerging technologies
ensures that our economy keeps progressing, that our society is using
all the benefits from these technologies, and ultimately, our military
has the latest and greatest capabilities, if they need to utilize it for
warfighting purposes," Bajraktari said. Meanwhile, the National Science
Foundation's National Science Board finds the U.S. remains strong in
terms of global R&D competition, but global competitors are catching up.
Victor McCrary, NSB's vice chairman and the vice president for research
and graduate programs at the University of the District of Columbia,
said the U.S. "still outpaces everybody in terms of overall global R&D."
However, McCrary said South Asian and Southeast Asian countries,
particularly China, have been increasing R&D spending in recent years.
"While the U.S. leads, that margin between us and our nearest
competitors is starting to close, and I think that's a concern from the
White House to the Congress, to many of our business, universities, as
well as the military," McCrary said. McCrary said [**basic R&D serves as
the foundation for breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum
information systems, 5G, biotechnology and advanced
manufacturing**.]{.underline} The National Science Board, under the
National Science Foundation Act, is required to send Congress and the
president a report on the state of science and engineering every
even-numbered year. This [year's report
shows](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20221) that in addition to being a
top global spender on R&D, the U.S. maintains a competitive advantage by
still drawing the best talent to its universities and companies. McCrary
said this talent pool gives the U.S. an international advantage. "We
still have the best companies in the world when it comes to AI
applications and integration of these things," he said. Bajraktari said
maintaining a high level of R&D spending is also a vital part of
developing the STEM workforce necessary to remain competitive. "If these
are our comparative advantages, then I think basic R&D can help towards
incentivizing students and Ph.D. candidates at universities to come up
with next-generation AI capabilities," Bajraktari said. However,
Bajraktari said federal agencies need to do a better job of ensuring
private-sector tech experts have opportunities to lend their expertise
to the government through short-term tours of duty. Meanwhile, he said
the Defense Department and the intelligence community need to develop
clearer career pathways for AI and emerging tech experts to stay in
federal service. "The career path inside a federal agency is not
clear-cut if you have a technology background. Until yesterday, this was
considered an IT issue, but this is no longer an IT issue. [**We need
the military to understand** that if somebody comes with a coding
background, **you have to incentivize** them and create a career pathway
**for them to stay there and get promoted and get incentivized** --- not
move them around every two-to-three years, like we do right
now.]{.underline} Because otherwise, you will lose the benefit of these
individuals coming with these skills," Bajraktari said.

#### Public-private partnership is key to AI 

**Sayler 20,** (Kelley M. Sayler, Analyst in Advanced Technology and
Global Security, November 10 2020, Congressional Research Service,
"Artificial Intelligence and National Security",
https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R45178.pdf)

Some reports indicate that DOD and the defense industry also face
challenges when it comes to recruiting and retaining personnel with
expertise in AI due to research funding and salaries that significantly
lag behind those of commercial companies.121 Other reports suggest that
such challenges stem from quality-of-life factors, as well as from a
[belief among many technology workers that "they can achieve large-scale
change faster and better outside the government than within it." 122
This sentiment echoes the findings of the National Security Commission
on Artificial Intelligence, which notes that]{.underline} ["AI experts
would be willing to serve in government if officials could create a more
compelling sense of purpose and a technical environment within
government that would maximize their talents]{.underline}." 123
Regardless, observers note that if DOD and defense industry are unable
to recruit and retain the appropriate experts, military AI applications
could be delayed, "deficient, or lacking in appropriate safeguards and
testing." 124 To address these challenges, the Obama Administration
launched the Defense Digital Service [in 2015 as a means of recruiting
private sector technology workers to serve in DOD for one to two year
assignments---a "tour of duty for nerds," according to former director
Chris Lynch.]{.underline} 125 Similarly, former Deputy Secretary of
Defense Bob Work has proposed an "AI Training Corps," in which [DOD
"would pay for advanced technical education in exchange for two days a
month of training with government systems and two weeks a year for major
exercises." Participants in the program could additionally be called to
government service in the event of a national emergency.]{.underline}126
Other analysts have recommended the establishment of new military
training and occupational specialties to cultivate AI talent, as well as
the creation of government fellowships and accelerated promotion tracks
to reward the most talented technology workers.

The [Defense Department believes that artificial intelligence will
transform warfare, and failure to adopt AI technology could hinder
national security.]{.underline} DOD is making organizational changes and
investing billions of dollars to incorporate AI technology. We found
that [DOD\'s AI-related strategies could be more comprehensive, such as
by including full descriptions of the resources needed for developing
AI-enabled technologies.]{.underline} In addition, DOD has not yet
issued guidance that clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of
components that participate in AI activities. Our 7 recommendations
address these and other issues. The 2018 Department of Defense (DOD)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy defines AI as the ability of
machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. The
strategy and associated plans include some, but not all, characteristics
of a comprehensive strategy. For example, DOD\'s nine AI-related
strategies and plans do not include full descriptions of resources and
investments and risk associated with adoption of AI-enabled
technologies. Issuing guidance to include all characteristics of a
comprehensive strategy in future AI-related strategies could help DOD be
better positioned to help managers ensure accountability and responsible
use of AI. Assessment of DOD Artificial Intelligence-Related Strategies
and Plans Assessment of DOD [Artificial Intelligence-Related Strategies
and Plans DOD has begun to identify and report on its AI activities, but
limitations exist in its AI baseline inventory, such as the exclusion of
classified activities.]{.underline} DOD officials said these limitations
will be addressed in subsequent phases of the AI inventory
identification process. However, DOD has not yet developed a high-level
plan or roadmap that captures all requirements and milestones. Such a
plan would provide DOD with a high-level, end-to-end view of all the
features necessary to accomplish the program\'s goal to provide a
complete and accurate inventory of AI activities to Congress and to DOD
decision makers. [DOD organizations collaborate on AI activities, but
can more fully incorporate leading collaboration practices. DOD uses a
variety of formal and informal collaborative mechanisms that GAO\'s
prior work has identified, such as interagency groups. DOD has partially
incorporated leading collaboration practices, such as identifying
leadership. However, DOD officials told us they are in the process of
developing guidance and agreements that clearly define the roles and
responsibilities of DOD components that participate in AI activities. By
finalizing and issuing such guidance, DOD could help ensure all
participants agree upon responsibilities and decision making on AI
efforts across the department.]{.underline} Why GAO Did This Study DOD
strategies state that AI will transform the character of warfare, and
failure to adopt AI technology could hinder the capability of
warfighters to defend our nation. DOD is making organizational changes
and investing billions of dollars to incorporate AI technology, such as
establishing the Joint AI Center to accelerate the delivery of
AI-enabled capabilities across DOD. House Report 116-442 accompanying
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021, includes a
provision for GAO to assess DOD\'s resources, capabilities, and plans
for AI technology. This report evaluates the extent to which (1) DOD\'s
AI Strategy and associated plans include characteristics of a
comprehensive strategy; (2) DOD has identified and reported AI
activities across the department; and (3) DOD collaborates on its AI
activities. GAO reviewed relevant laws and DOD strategies that outline
plans and processes to manage AI across the department, interviewed
officials, and conducted a department-wide survey. [This is a public
version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in February 2022.
Information that DOD deemed sensitive has been omitted.]{.underline}

WASHINGTON: A new artificial intelligence fund tucked away in the \$1.5
trillion fiscal 2022 spending package signed by President Joe Biden this
week could aid the Pentagon in its efforts to increase adoption of AI at
the combatant command level. [The \$200 million Artificial Intelligence
and Development Fund]{.underline} is meant to [improve tactical AI at
combatant commands.]{.underline} However, according to budget documents,
congressional defense committees want a briefing by Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin on an "execution plan" before the Pentagon can lay hands on
any of the funding. The [new fund aligns with the Defense Department's
AI efforts]{.underline}, notably the AI and Data Acceleration initiative
announced last year by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks. Under
the effort, [operational data and AI flyaway teams of technical experts
are being sent to the military's 11 COCOMs]{.underline} to help them
better understand their data and create AI tools to streamline
decision-making. [DoD wants to use the information gathered]{.underline}
from the teams and COCOMs [to "update its network infrastructure, remove

[which is developing a joint operating system for COCOMs build and field
AI algorithms rapidly]{.underline}. This "integration layer" will be the
first of its kind for DoD, JAIC Director Lt. Gen. Michael Groen told
Breaking Defense in February. The Navy also revealed its own involvement
in the effort at the WEST 2022 conference in San Diego in February.
Duncan McCaskill, the Navy's chief analytics officer, told the audience
the service had sent one of its data engineers out to a shipyard to help
personnel at EUCOM work through a use case for three months. As of
February, DoD had completed its first round of assessments at the
COCOMs. The \$1.5 trillion funding package also contains \$50 million to
improve recruitment and development of AI talent, \$70 million to
increase DARPA's AI, cyber and data analytics efforts, \$23 million to
improving training at US Cyber Command and \$62 million to strengthen
DoD networks from cyber threats.

### S -- Cyber

#### Public-private relationship is critical for protecting critical infrastructures against cyber attacks

**Brooks 19** (Chuck Brooks - President of Brooks Consulting
International. "Public Private Partnerships And The Cybersecurity
Challenge Of Protecting Critical Infrastructure." Forbes. May 6, 2019.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/05/06/public-private-partnerships-and-the-cybersecurity-challenge-of-protecting-critical-infrastructure/?sh=134a6ca25a57.)

In the U.S., most of the critical infrastructure, including defense, oil
and gas, electric power grids, health care, utilities, communications,
transportation, education, banking and finance, is owned by the private
sector (about 85 percent according to DHS) and regulated by the public
sector. [The **public and private relationship** in operating and
protecting **critical** infrastructure requires a strong working
partnership]{.underline}. [Protecting the critical infrastructure poses
a difficult challenge]{.underline} because democratic societies by their
nature are interactive, open and accessible. Because of the growing
digital connectivity (and interdependence) of both IT and industrial
control systems, critical infrastructure is facing an evolving and
sophisticated array of cybersecurity challenges. A recent survey of
professionals in industries using industrial control systems (ICS) and
operational technology (OT) commissioned by Tenable from the Ponemon
Institute found that 90 percent of respondents say their environment has
been damaged by at least one cyberattack over the past two years, with
62 percent experiencing two or more attacks. The survey of security
professionals also revealed that nine in 10 critical infrastructure
providers have experienced cyberattacks that rendered their systems out
of action in the last two years. Director of National Intelligence Dan
Coats recently stated that "[the threat was growing for a devastating
cyber assault on critical U.S. infrastructure]{.underline}, saying the
'warning lights are blinking red again' nearly two decades after the
Sept. 11, 2001, attacks". Critical infrastructure is the core of our
nations' prosperity and well-being and addressing the threats to it
requires incorporating a robust calculated security strategy of public
and private sector partnering. Cybersecurity relies on the same security
elements for protection as physical security: layered vigilance,
readiness and resilience. For example, energy security and the power
grid requires private public cooperation and regulatory coordination
among industry and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of
Energy (DOE), and the Department of Defense (DOD). The power grid and
other industrial infrastructure have been increasingly subjected to both
physical and cybersecurity attacks in recent years. According to Israel
Barak, CISO at Cybereason, \"most countries are still vulnerable to
cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure because the systems are
generally old and poorly patched. Power grids are interconnected and
thus vulnerable to cascading failures." Protecting critical ICS, OT, and
IT systems from cybersecurity threats is a difficult endeavor. They all
have unique operational frameworks, access points, and a variety of
legacy systems and emerging technologies. The explosion of connected
devices comprising the Internet of Things and the Industrial Internet of
Things is daunting. The trends of integration of hardware and software
combined with growing networked sensors are redefining the surface
attack opportunities for hackers across all digital infrastructures.
According to the DHS Alert (TA17-293A) threat actors have targeted
government entities and the energy, water, aviation, nuclear, and
critical manufacturing sectors since at least 2017 and, in some cases,
have leveraged their capabilities to compromise victims' networks.
Historically, cyber threat actors have targeted the energy sector with
various results, ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt
energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict. Analysis by DHS, FBI,
and trusted partners has identified distinct indicators and behaviors
related to this activity. It\'s a global threat not just against the
United States. In 2017, Hackers use Triton, a specialized malware to
compromise critical safety systems at Schneider Electric. The malware is
still being used to target industrial systems. [Because of]{.underline}
[the sensitivity to the threats to national security and changing threat
matrix of hackers augmented by newer technologies]{.underline} such as
machine learning and artificial intelligence, [the government is
prioritizing the importance of the risk management approach to defend
against more sophisticated malware and automated attacks targeting
critical infrastructure.]{.underline} [An effective risk management
approach necessitates information sharing that helps allow government
and industry to keep abreast of the latest viruses, malware, phishing
threats, ransomware, insider threats, and denial of service
attacks.]{.underline} Information sharing also establishes working
protocols for lessons-learned and resilience that is critical for the
success of mitigating incidents. A cornerstone of that approach is
creating Public Private Partnerships (PPP) based upon risk management
frameworks. [A high level of **public-private collaboration** is needed
to address growing cyber-threats]{.underline}. [Preparation and
commitment from both government and **industry leadership** is
critical]{.underline}. [Industry should collaborate with government to
best utilize risk management models and prepare resiliency
plans.]{.underline} The specifics of an industry security approach may
vary according to circumstances, but the mesh that connects the elements
is situational awareness combined with systematic abilities for
operational management and critical communications in cases of
emergency. In the federal civilian sector DHS's new agency, Critical
Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) puts a keen focus on DHS's
integral role in cyber preparedness, response and resilience for
critical infrastructure. DHS has identified 16 infrastructures deemed
critical because their physical and digital assets, systems, and
networks are considered vital to national economic security, safety and
national public health. CISA's stated role is to coordinate "security
and resilience efforts using trusted partnerships across the private and
public sectors, and deliver training, technical assistance, and
assessments to federal stakeholders as well as to infrastructure owners
and operators nationwide." At DOD, Former Commander of the U.S. Cyber
Command and former Director of the National Security Agency hailed the
importance of the public-private cybersecurity partnership stating that
"collaboration is critical given growing threats to everyone from
cyberspace." DOD and the National Security Agency (NSA) are working
closely with the private sector in information sharing and in developing
solutions to evolving threats. Whether the U.S. critical infrastructure
protection security mission includes DHS, DOD, DOE, the intelligence
community, or other government agencies, [a public/private security
strategy to meet growing challenges needs to be both comprehensive and
adaptive]{.underline}. The same formula applies to other democratic
nations sharing operations across industries and infrastructure.

#### **Public-private partnership is the key to preventing future cyber attacks**

**Reilly 21** (Dan Reilly -- journalist and editor. "Cybersecurity
experts say public-private partnership is the key to preventing future
attacks." Fortune. November 16, 2021.
https://fortune.com/2021/11/16/cybersecurity-future-government-corporation-partnership-data-breach/)

The number of data breaches through the third quarter of 2021 is up 17%
over the previous year combined, according to the Identity Theft
Resource Center. A study by IBM and the Ponemon Institute says the cost
of the average data breach is up to \$4.24 million, up from \$3.86
million in 2020. [Some estimates say cyberattacks could cost businesses
and government agencies \$6 trillion in 2021 alone, with that number
rising dramatically in the years to come.]{.underline} With hacks coming
from foreign governments and small groups of cybercriminals alike, a
question remains---who's responsible for preventing these attacks, the
government or the corporations? According to Kiersten Todt, the Chief of
Staff of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a federal
agency operating under the Department of Homeland Security, the only way
forward is to have businesses and the government fighting this digital
war together. That's why CISA launched the Joint Cyber Defense
Collaborative initiative in August, a public-private partnership to help
boost cybersecurity with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all taking part.
"What this is doing is sort of taking that approach and turning it on
its side because it\'s really about operational collaboration," Todt
said at the Fortune CEO Initiative conference in Washington, D.C. on
Tuesday. "I\'ve had a lot of thinking around, \'Is this a concept that
could have succeeded a few years ago?\' and I\'m not actually sure that
it could have because one of the things that SolarWinds demonstrated was
that the private sector has enormous intelligence capability on each of
its own companies. Government has capabilities in understanding
nation-state activity." Todt noted [the marriage of government and
corporate capabilities to detect, prevent, and share information about
an attack before it happens is at the heart of operational
collaboration]{.underline}. "This operational collaboration has already
been put into effect and has had some successes, and it is going to
expand out to different companies," said Todt. [This **public-private
partnership is crucial**]{.underline}, according to Christian Brose, the
Chief Strategy Officer of the defense tech company Anduril Industries.
"When I was in government three years ago, the thing that we were all
struggling with was, \'Who is responsible for what?'" he said. "'When is
a private company responsible for defending itself in this kind of gray
zone? Is it really responsible for defending itself when it\'s being
attacked by a pure adversary with nation-level capability?\' At what
point does the government really have to take responsibility for that?
So the ability to actually begin marrying \[these efforts\], in an
operational sense, is super important." "That\'s so important, because
when we were just talking about this before, a few years ago,we
recognized that cyber is the only domain where we ask industry to defend
itself," Todt added. "Having that type of pre-event work so that you\'re
not, in a time of crisis, trying to figure out where the marks are for
who does what but there\'s actually a benefit to working together and
it\'s not seen as a penalty is an important step in progress." [It's an
urgent development]{.underline}, Brose said, [because we're past the
time to be worrying about eventualities in cybersecurity]{.underline}.
"The thing that I would sort of underscore here is the future is now,
the future is not coming," he said, noting that there are cheap drones
and A.I.-enabled weapons being used in conflicts around the world. "We
oftentimes talk about getting ready for the future, and I would argue
we\'ve actually already been ambushed by it."

//jsam

A whole-of-nation [**strategy needs to have clear objectives** that are
easily understood and actionable by the public and private sectors for
the good of the American people]{.underline}. These objectives should
include resiliency, redundancy, hardening, investigation, and sharing of
information as a minimum. To meet those objectives a **[whole-of-nation
strategic framework requires: True public-private
partnership.]{.underline}** This requires not only the **[private sector
to trust the government]{.underline}** with information that they
consider vital, but also that the **[government must trusts the private
sector with the information it needs]{.underline}**. **[This means an
equal exchange of information]{.underline}**. **[Sharing ideas,
techniques, and technology.]{.underline}** Shared information about
attacks themselves is only part of it. Allowing for a sharing of ideas,
techniques, and technology is just as important. The [government cannot
afford to attract all the cyber experts into government jobs, nor should
it want to; it needs the innovation and energy of the private
sector]{.underline}. Bringing that innovation into the fold creates
resources to counter our adversaries. Many in the private sector see the
government as the enemy and their employees, shareholders, and customers
protest when they partner with the government. [This must be overcome by
establishing a trusting environment. **Shared action. The strategy may
limit offensive cyber activities to government agencies, or it may
include a limited licensing to a few trusted companies.**]{.underline}
This would not be as much a letter of marque as an avenue to seek
permission to take one-time action on a target. Either way, all involved
need to have visibility on actions taken and a voice---especially when
it is the private sector that might take the brunt of any retaliation.
**[Regulations.]{.underline}** Although it is not popular with the
private sector**[, government regulation will be
required]{.underline}**. Without it, incentives will not change and
information sharing and investment in sound defenses will be hampered.
**[Other nations will continue to see cyberattacks on both government
and private sector targets as a cheap and effective way to counter the
United States.]{.underline}** The current whole-of-government response
is full of noble intent, but it is not a winning strategy. It fails to
take advantage of the resources and expertise in the private sector that
a whole-of-nation response can. The United States' free economy, and the
incentives it brings, gives it a **[competitive advantage over its
adversaries, but only if it actively engages with private sector
actors]{.underline}** and convinces them that a whole-of-nation response
is in their best interest.

Response [Companies are pressuring government officials for a solution,
or at least more freedom to act themselves]{.underline}. The government
is not ignoring the problem, but [countering cyberattacks requires not
only the technical capability to hack back; it also involves
understanding a complex web of attribution and considerations governing
the use of force, law enforcement, policy, and obligations to protect
the innocent.]{.underline} While many companies would like to take a
more active role in punishing those caught hacking their systems, this
might cause more harm than good. However, discounting private companies
is also a mistake. Subscribing to social contract theory does not mean
that private citizens do not have a role to play in ensuring societal
well-being[. Juries are made up of everyday citizens and private think
tanks routinely advise the government on security issues. The social
contract in a democracy must be participatory.]{.underline} In fact, it
is this participation in the government that gives democracies their
strength. Participation brings new ideas, energy, and accountability.
**[A successful cyber posture that both defends against attacks and
punishes those that are successful will take a concerted effort by
government and the private sector.]{.underline} [The government needs to
take a lead in developing and executing a competitive strategy that
bridges the public-private divide and increases the United States'
advantage]{.underline}**. But what form should that partnership take?
Ought offensive or defensive approaches be prioritized?

estimated that 90 percent of company chief information security officers
make cybersecurity decisions based on outdated intelligence data. And
[**since there is very little information sharing, cyberattackers are
often able to exploit the same vulnerability over and over**
again]{.underline} to inflict damage on thousands of enterprises around
the world. Since companies are not basing their purchase decisions on an
accurate assessment of risks, there is little incentive for software
providers to emphasize cybersecurity. Software products that are
designed with enhanced security features are rarely able to command a
premium, and many [software companies have made the rational calculation
that putting expensive resources into cybersecurity will not be rewarded
by the market.]{.underline} Nor do they tend to suffer when their
products are attacked. After all, as computer scientists Ross Anderson
and Tyler Moore have pointed out, the clients of software
companies---not the software companies themselves---are the ones that
bear most of the costs of a cybersecurity failure. Meanwhile, companies
are often reluctant to disclose cyberattacks when they occur, for fear
of damaging their reputations----or worse, subjecting themselves to
litigation. That reticence allows malicious hackers to reuse the same
methods elsewhere. And cyber insurers, firms who write insurance
policies to cover financial losses sustained by data breaches and
digital disruptions, are similarly unwilling to share information about
the efficacy of particular security defenses, which they view as
proprietary. [As a result, many **companies make critical cybersecurity
investment decisions based on marketing or word of mouth rather than
hard data**. **If information about threats were quickly shared around
the world, cyberattacks would immediately lose much of their
potency**.]{.underline} [Companies would be able to quickly prioritize
and address urgent security flaws within their digital networks or
operating systems and malign actors would no longer be able to exploit a
single vulnerability to attack a large number of targets]{.underline}.
But to date, the government has struggled to overcome built-in
resistance in the private sector to information-sharing about
cyberthreats.

Defensive Public-Private Cybersecurity Partnerships

[**Given the limitations inherent to engaging the private sector in
offensive cyber operations, defensive options** ought to be more
carefully **considered**. Like any successful defense, early preparation
and **information sharing is critical**.]{.underline} Building robust
defenses and communicating information about vulnerabilities, where the
enemy is likely to attack, any early indications of an attack, and how
to support and reconstitute areas attacked are key to strengthening
defensive measures and limiting damage. In 2017, global shipping company
Maersk was the victim of a cyberattack that affected its terminals,
ports, and ships around the world, costing the company at least \$200
million. **[Maersk's willingness to share information allowed the US
Coast Guard to warn other companies, focus resources, and limit cost to
maritime infrastructure. The cooperation by Maersk is a great example of
what is needed, but it is the exception, not the norm.]{.underline}**
The administrations of both the Donald Trump and Joe Biden issued
**[executive orders to address cyber vulnerabilities, but these orders
were for federal systems and did not include the private sector, mainly
due to strong industry resistance to government regulation.
Companies]{.underline}** exhibit a natural **[prefer]{.underline}**ence
for a strong, [**government-led offensive cyber response to deter
would-be attackers**, instead of paying for expensive defensive
measures]{.underline}. Nevertheless, protecting networks needs to be the
first step in a successful competitive strategy, and communicating
threats is integral to shoring up cyber defenses. Consequently,
**[information sharing is crucial to successful public-private
cybersecurity partnerships.]{.underline}** A physical attack is easy to
observe, and attribution is usually much easier, allowing for a timely
and appropriate response by the government. However, for cyberattacks
the [government is often dependent on third parties to
inform]{.underline} [them of not only the occurrence, but also the
breadth of the attack.]{.underline} **[Increasing reporting requirements
is one way to help raise awareness and possible attribution, but
mandates alone are insufficient.]{.underline}** Currently, there is a
hodgepodge of [reporting requirements that vary considerably by industry
and oversight agency]{.underline}. Recently, there has been a move to
standardize reporting requirements, giving the government better
visibility and information to decide appropriate actions. This is not
without controversy. [Many in industry do not want their victimization
made public,]{.underline} because it could reduce revenue, as well as
investors' and customers' confidence. For instance, the 2013 attack on
Target exposed forty-one million of its customers' payment card
information and resulted in a substantial drop in revenue, lost
customers, and a large settlement agreement. Moreover, many companies do
not view reporting as useful due to a perceived lack of leadership,
responsiveness, and assistance provided by the government in response to
cyber incidents. Although companies are reticent to provide this
information, the government cannot develop a coherent response to these
attacks without awareness. There must be coordinated government action
that changes incentives and increases trust. Trust, of course, works
both ways. **[Just as the private sector must trust the government to
represent its best interests in responding to cyberattacks, the
government must also be able to trust private sector entities in order
to effectively partner on cybersecurity]{.underline}**. Engaging private
entities on national security interests is not unprecedented. Besides
the obvious defense contractors, there are also occasions when private
industry is allowed to see behind the curtain. [Government must be
willing to do this more often]{.underline}. (Admittedly, though, complex
ownership and investment structures that often involve non-US persons
and financial interests in today's globalized economy can make this even
more challenging.) This goes beyond just setting up additional advisory
boards under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. These boards are often
just cursory, given little information, and paid little attention to by
relevant US government departments and agencies. On the other hand, the
[boards' efficacy is limited as they are too often populated with
members that have long since retired from industry and no longer occupy
influential positions. Instead of building trust between government and
industry, they create frustration. Advisory boards need to be populated
with current industry leaders and trusted with information and
decisions. The government needs to show the private sector how it is
part of the nation's strategic competition with its
adversaries.]{.underline}

### S - Russia

#### The CP is key to deterring Russian cyber attacks

**Huggins '22** (Katherine Huggins -- Reporter, Medill News Service.
"U.S. lawmakers hope to bolster infrastructure\'s cyber defenses amid
Russian threat." UPI. 4/6/22.
https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2022/04/06/Russian-hackers-Senate-committee-hearings/3571649273861/)

Top federal cybersecurity officials and members of Congress said this
week that [the invasion of Ukraine increases the **risk of Russian
hackers** targeting critical infrastructure]{.underline}, and [they
urged **more coordination between the government and private companies**
to combat the threat]{.underline}. The United States \"desperately needs
to revamp the playbook it uses for critical infrastructure
cybersecurity,\" Rep. Yvette Clark, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House
Homeland Security committee\'s Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection
and Security Technologies subcommittee, said Wednesday. \"Our nation\'s
critical infrastructure is vulnerable to cyberattacks, and [the federal
government has resources it can bring to bear in closing security gaps,
but we\'ve been reluctant to make the private sector come to the
table]{.underline},\" she said. Subcommittee members on Wednesday heard
from experts who outlined how the United States could work to strengthen
public-private partnerships in the cybersecurity sector. On Tuesday, the
full House Homeland Security Committee discussed securing critical
infrastructure against Russian cyber threats. That committee\'s vice
chair, Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., said that as the United States continues
to impose sanctions on Russia and its leaders over its invasion of
Ukraine, \"we must consider the potential risk to the homeland.\" \"Over
the past decade, [Russia has demonstrated its ability and willingness to
use cyber tools to advance its global agenda.]{.underline} It has used
its neighbors in Eastern Europe as testbeds for deploying its cyber
capabilities to interfere with elections, spread disinformation, and
disrupt critical infrastructure,\" Torres said. He cited Russia\'s
[attacks on Ukraine\'s power
grid](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-38573074) in 2015 and 2016 and
the [NotPetya
attack](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-military-was-behind-notpetya-cyberattack-in-ukraine-cia-concludes/2018/01/12/048d8506-f7ca-11e7-b34a-b85626af34ef_story.html)
in 2017, which wiped computer data from Ukrainian banks, energy firms,
government officials and an airport. For several lawmakers, [the
question is not whether Russia will orchestrate a cyberattack, but what
it will target and when]{.underline}. \"I am very worried. I think it\'s
more likely than not that Russia will start using cyber attacks against
the West,\" Rep. [Bill Foster](https://www.upi.com/topic/Bill_Foster/),
D-Ill., said in a March interview. \"And when that happens, we have to
understand how we\'re going to avoid a retaliatory spiral.\" A Russian
cyberattack most likely would come in the form of ransomware, as SWIFT
sanctions have encouraged a reliance on cryptocurrency to access foreign
capital, according to Adam Levin, former director of the New Jersey
Division of Consumer Affairs and host of the \"What the Hack with Adam
Levin\" podcast. SWIFT is is a Belgian cooperative society that provide
services related to the execution of financial transactions and payments
between banks worldwide. \"Because of all of the sanctions, ransomware
becomes a very big deal for \[Russia\], because it can actually help
them by way of cryptocurrency make up some of what they\'re losing by
all the sanctions,\" Levin said in an interview. The top Republican on
the subcommittee, [Rep. Andrew Garbarino]{.underline} of New York, said
that \"cyberthreats posed by foreign adversaries are only becoming more
potent.\" \"Potential for malicious Russian cyber activity, as well
attacks by other adversarial nations like China, Iran and [North
Korea](https://www.upi.com/topic/North_Korea/), is only increasing,\" he
[said, **calling on Congress to continue facilitating public-private
partnerships** **to curb threats**]{.underline}. Specifically, concerns
about water infrastructure being targeted have grown since the cyber
attack on a treatment facility in Oldsmar, Fla., last February, Levin
said. According to investigators, the hacker used remote access software
to raise the levels of sodium hydroxide \-- a chemical compound used in
small amounts to remove metals from water \-- from about 100 parts per
million to more than 11,000 ppm. An employee noticed something was wrong
before anyone was hurt. The Oldsmar hack was mentioned in both hearings,
but Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., brought up a separate instance of water
infrastructure being targeted through a ransomware attack in [Atlantic
County,
N.J.](https://pressofatlanticcity.com/news/local/cyber-incident-brings-down-acua-website/article_a8432eeb-ce75-54b5-86d9-2a7d1e8bac7f.html)
(A similar attack also occurred in [Jersey
City](https://www.nj.com/hudson/2021/01/3-months-after-cyberattack-that-threatened-public-health-crisis-jersey-city-mua-computer-systems-still-not-fully-restored.html).)
\"Services like utility authorities are vital to day-to-day life, and it
is imperative that Congress and the administration continue to invest in
protecting critical infrastructure everywhere small or large in every
way,\" Van Drew said. \"It affects every aspect of our life.\" While
water facilities remain a top potential target, communication
infrastructure and financial infrastructure also could be hit, Levin
said. \"What if they attacked the ability of financial institutions to
provide cash through ATM machines?\" he said. \"Or what if they were to
do something that would disrupt the free flow of credit card
transactions?\" [The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
was repeatedly mentioned in both hearings as a conduit for combating
cyber threats across sectors by increasing information sharing and
coordination across private industry and the federal
government.]{.underline} \"I can\'t say enough [how encouraging it is to
see that CISA is developing those really trusted and treasured
partnerships in the private sector]{.underline},\" said New York Rep.
John Katko, the top Republican on the full committee. \"[It\'s so
critical to their mission and the more we develop that trust and the
trusted exchange of information]{.underline}, by far we are going to
make the whole cyber landscape safer.\" Crowdstrike\'s senior vice
president for intelligence credited CISA\'s Joint Cyber Defense
Collaborative for \"disrupt\[ing\] Russian infrastructure preparing for
cyber operations.\" Based in Austin, Texas, Crowdstrike provides cloud
workload and endpoint security, threat intelligence and cyberattack
response services. \"We actively participate in public-private
partnerships such as CISA\'s JCDC, through which we have worked with
select industry partners to disrupt Russian infrastructure preparing for
cyber operations,\" Adam Meyers said Tuesday. The White House\'s acting
principal deputy national cyber director, Robert Knake, said the biggest
asset the federal government can provide to private sector companies to
curb cyber threats is increased intelligence. \"We\'ve heard from every
private sector company we\'ve talked to is to make sure we provide the
one thing private companies can\'t do on their own, which is
intelligence,\" he said. \"Only the U.S. government can collect
intelligence and only the U.S. government can provide it back.\"
[**Lawmakers from both parties appeared motivated** to strengthen
infrastructure security by improving coordination between the government
and private sector to reduce cyber threats,]{.underline} in part
evidenced by the passage of the Fiscal Year 2022 Omnibus, which included
the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act. The
legislation, deemed a \"game-changer\" in a [statement by
CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/news/2022/03/11/statement-cisa-director-easterly-passage-cyber-incident-reporting-legislation),
set two new reporting obligations and timeframes for critical
infrastructure operators. The agency expressed gratitude for receiving
an \"unprecedented level of funding.\"

#### Public-private collaboration is key to countering Russia's cyber attacks

**Fort Mead '18** ("Russian attack on U.S. election highlights need for
public-private cyber security efforts." *Fort Meade Alliance.* Feb 2018.
https://www.ftmeadealliance.org/2018/02/russian-attack-on-u-s-election-highlights-need-for-public-private-cyber-security-efforts/)

Reflecting on Russia's meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, U.S. Senator
Ben Cardin said Fort George G. Meade and its tenants -- including the
National Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. Cyber Command -- constitute "our
frontline defense to what I think is the greatest threat to America."
Speaking to a gathering of government officials and private sector
executives, [Cardin stressed the need for heightened public-private
collaboration to resist increasingly sophisticated cyber assaults on
American democracy]{.underline}. The gathering, organized by the Fort
Meade Alliance (FMA), focused on ways to improve America's cyber
defenses and included insights from NSA Executive Director Harry Coker,
Jr. and Leidos Chairman and CEO Roger Krone. The 2016 election
demonstrated how [the Russian government has become highly skilled at
using asymmetric tools -- including cyber attacks, propaganda and social
media bots -- to impact other countries]{.underline}, Cardin said. But
the election was "just a small part of the overall design that \[Russian
President Vladimir\] Putin has for an all-out assault on democratic
institutions" in the U.S., Mexico and Europe," he said. The Central
Intelligence Agency has already warned that Russia will be "extremely
active" in the 2018 mid-term elections, Cardin added. The United States
faces "a diverse set of national security challenges from a diverse set
of adversaries, both state and non-state actors," Coker said.
Furthermore, the technology employed by those adversaries "will continue
to grow exponentially," he said. "One thing I have noted in my decades
within national security is there are plenty of very bright adversaries
and they are paying attention ... so they are a tough challenge." A
report released in January by the Democratic staff of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee detailed two decades of Putin's attacks on
democratic institutions and called for policy changes to protect the
2018 and 2020 elections. The report "is fascinating and terrifying all
at the same time," said Steve Tiller, FMA President. "It emphasizes that
the U.S. and its European allies are still extremely vulnerable to cyber
attacks and it recommends a commitment to mutual defense both in Europe
and the U.S. against state-sponsored cyber attacks through rapid
reaction teams, international treaties and other resources." Tiller
asked what can the private sector do to facilitate those defense
efforts? "[In America, we still have not figured out how the government
and the private sector can work together in cyber]{.underline}," Cardin
said. [Collaboration is challenged by a "mindset that we can't just
freely share information about cyber threats and vulnerabilities between
the public and private sector,"]{.underline} Coker said. "We need to
look at things differently." **[Public and private
sectors]{.underline}**, Cardin and Coker said, **[need to hone methods
of sharing cyber threat information that are safe, productive and
trusted by the public.]{.underline}** [Leaders in cyber, both from the
public and private sectors, need to increase efforts to develop and
employ a highly skilled workforce,]{.underline} Krone said. In addition
to supporting relevant courses in schools and universities, and offering
internship programs, cyber leaders need to re-examine labor categories
for cyber jobs, he said. "We probably don't have enough categories at
the entry level. Most start at five years of experience as an analyst,"
Krone said. That requirement makes it difficult to make good use of new
college graduates and often results in contractors being "slow to staff"
federal projects, Krone said. "We have to take more risk on our people,"
Coker said. "Typically, in the public sector we hire on demonstrated
performance... We need to take a look at ability to learn and if the
individual is in line with the institution's core values. We lose out on
too many good people because we say, you haven't done X, Y or Z." The
cyber sector, Krone said, could increase its workforce and staff
projects faster if it could make greater use of retiring military
personnel who have conditional security clearances and can start work
while they complete their permanent clearances. [Cyber companies could
strengthen America's cyber defenses by focusing more on "the fidelity of
information we get through the digital media]{.underline}," Krone said.
"The attacks in the last election really went to that core where we
didn't know if an article was fake news or not. We didn't know what
messages to believe... That really tears apart the fabric of society."
"We really need to get to the point where we are doing information
assurance \[to prevent cyber attacks\] and not forensics and reactions
to cyber events," Krone said. **[Information-assurance
efforts,]{.underline}** Cardin said, **[would counter one of Russia's
primary attack strategies.]{.underline}** "Part of Putin's design is to
discredit all news...and \[argue\] that no elections are totally free,"
Cardin said. "[We need to work together to restore confidence in our
system, in our independent media]{.underline}... We need to build up the
institutions that strengthen our democratic country."

RIGHT OF BOOM CYBER DEFENSE NETWORK"
<https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/building-a-regional-right-of-boom-cyber-defense-network/>)
CL

The invasion of Ukraine thrust the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency into public consciousness as the nation's key cyber
security risk advisor during a time of heightened risk. Congress
recently passed legislation requiring critical infrastructure operators
to notify the agency of security breaches, bringing it into closer
contact with the private sector. This development builds on positive
momentum for the agency, following a series of executive orders that
expanded its authority and created **[a specific [Joint Cyber Defense
Collaborative](https://www.cisa.gov/jcdc)]{.underline}** to share
information about threats between the public and private sectors. Nearly
four years after its creation, the agency **[now has more visibility
into the risks the country is facing and more resources at its disposal
to combat them. But to capitalize on this momentum toward greater
public-private partnership, the agency should deepen its engagement with
smaller organizations]{.underline}** in the private sector and at the
state and local levels. In
our [research](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/toward-collaborative-cyber-defense-and-enhanced-threat-intelligence-structure),
many private sector stakeholders described difficulties working with the
federal government on cyber security issues: They didn't know whom to
speak with, and, even when they had a point of contact, did not always
get the results they hoped for. What's more, they sometimes worried
about sharing information with federal law enforcement that would
subject them to liability. The federal government also has concerns of
its own. Private companies and state or municipality-run utilities often
lack the resources and financial incentives to implement needed cyber
security measures. These systemic issues were highlighted in a recent
three-hour phone call between senior Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency officials and over 13,000 private-sector cyber security
professionals. Both agency director Jen Easterly and the stakeholders on
the
call [noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/28/public-gets-peek-into-tensions-between-us-cyber-officials-industry/?utm_campaign=wp_the_cybersecurity_202&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_cybersecurity202) the
urgent need to better work with local and regional partners. And while
the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative is bringing the largest companies
together with Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, it is
still only virtual collaboration. In short, there is still a degree of
distrust and distance preventing the government and private sector from
working together to defend America's cyber infrastructure. To overcome
this, we recommend a more regional focus. The agency should start by
bolstering its 10 existing regional offices with the \$8 million in
funding recommended for the agency's FY2023 budget. This would bring
more capabilities and presence into the field to build trusted
relationships, increase information sharing, and focus on right of boom,
or post-disaster, mitigation efforts. [**Enhancing the agency's
[regional
offices](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/toward-collaborative-cyber-defense-and-enhanced-threat-intelligence-structure#toc-2-0-0)**
would **capitalize on** its **current momentum** and bring it closer to
the end user.]{.underline} To do this[, the agency should **transform
its [regional offices](https://www.cisa.gov/cisa-regions)** from
advisory posts **to collaborative** defensive and analysis
**centers**]{.underline}. As former commander of Joint Special
Operations Gen. (ret.) Stanley McChrystal has
[said](https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/02/21/it-takes-a-network/), "It
takes a network to defeat a network." The physical network
infrastructure exists in the form of regional offices --- with added
support from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's field offices. But
those offices could be bolstered by creating additional private and
public sector capacity to work alongside the current cadre of cyber
security advisors, physical security advisors, emergency communications
coordinators, and chemical security inspectors. Borrowing some concepts
from the [U.S. military's Joint Operations
Centers](https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Doctrine/fp/jtf_hq_org_fp.pdf),
[**these** collaborative defense and analysis centers **could bring
together cross-functional teams of analysts** and operators **from the
public and private sectors**.]{.underline} These would include
representatives from federal regulatory and law enforcement agencies,
critical infrastructure sectors, major municipal regions, businesses
with cyber defense capability, and [Information Sharing and Analysis
Centers,](https://www.nationalisacs.org/about-isacs) which serve to
share threat intelligence in specific sectors. We also recommended
hosting regular "operations and intelligence" briefings that would hold
all these nodes in place. While asking people to physically sit together
may seem archaic in the age of COVID, [ultimately, we believe that
**such a model would bring greater unity, physical breadth, and
functional diversity**.]{.underline} They would also make the field
office a more accessible touchpoint for businesses and state governments
operating within their region. Enabling the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency to pour more resources into those offices
and bring more participants would boost visibility, sustainability, and
scale across the country. [It would also combat local threats and build
deeper trust by improving information sharing with local businesses and
the general population]{.underline}. [This can help address the
challenges facing smaller utilities like [municipal water
systems](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/its-time-regulate-water-and-wastewater-cybersecurity-heres-how),
which have struggled to secure their networks.]{.underline} And [**there
are resources to do this**. The congressional commissioners who served
on t**he [Cyber Solarium Commission](https://www.solarium.gov/home)
recommended \$8 million** in additional funding for regional offices in
the agency's 2023 budget.]{.underline} The former executive director of
the commission, Mark Montgomery, recently told us that "in locations
that are home to a high density of critical infrastructure, a single
coordinator will be insufficient to meet the requirements to provide a
more mature risk analysis and measurements capability outside of the
federal network and provide an increased ability to support special
projects and national level events." The Australian Example Deep,
institutionalized regional engagement between the U.S. government and
private sector on cyber security would constitute a significant new
development. Australia's network of [Joint Cyber Security
Centres](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/programs/joint-cyber-security-centres)
provides one good model to emulate. Established in 2017 and located in
hubs like Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney, these have
succeeded in embedding resources at the local level and building
expertise for public-private collaboration. Run by Australia's
Cybersecurity Directorate, the Joint Cyber Security Centres "bring
together businesses and the research community, along with state,
territory and Australian Government agencies, in an open and cooperative
environment" to drive collaboration and information-sharing. Since their
establishment, the centers have worked to build trust and better
relationships between the government and private sector by offering
access to sensitive information and facilitating more rapid and
effective responses to cyber threats. Additionally, in order to provide
threat intelligence calibrated to an organization's capabilities and
requirements, the centers offered tiered security clearance programs
which allow varying levels of access to information and facilities.
Right of Boom Enhanced regional offices similar to the Joint
Cybersecurity Centres can be particularly valuable in disaster planning
and response. As Juliette Kayyem writes in her
[book](https://juliettekayyem.com/the-devil-never-sleeps/), The Devil
Never Sleeps, we must focus on "left of boom" and "right of boom"
planning. The Joint Cybersecurity Centres focus on the left of boom,
that is, staving off attacks by raising our collective level of security
and implementing cyber security standards through regulations. But, as
Kayyem notes, disasters will happen, again and again --- like many of us
[warned](https://hbr.org/2022/02/the-cybersecurity-risks-of-an-escalating-russia-ukraine-conflict?utm_campaign=hbr&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter)
U.S. businesses in the lead-up to and during the Russian war in Ukraine.
So we should also focus on mitigating the worst of the disaster's effect
after it happens to make it less severe. Strengthened Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency regional offices, therefore, could build
on the Australian model to support planning for the right of boom. One
of the most important aspects of disaster continuity planning is the
establishment and maintenance of personal relationships, especially
face-to-face ones. Under [Presidential Policy Directive
41](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/26/presidential-policy-directive-united-states-cyber-incident),
the Department of Homeland Security is tasked with coordinating the
government's "Asset Response" leg of the Cybersecurity National Action
Plan, which involves assessing risk and providing guidance for recovery
and damage mitigation. The best way to do this is at the local level,
with easily accessible offices that invite companies and organizations
to come in and meet and speak with their government counterparts
regularly. While some states are working on [Continuity of
Economy](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2022/01/21/lawmakers-plan-continuity-of-the-economy/)
plans, disaster recovery is far too important of a national priority for
this patchwork approach. The 2021 National Defense Appropriations Act
[stipulated](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2022/01/21/lawmakers-plan-continuity-of-the-economy/)
the president must create a plan to address this within two years ---
and the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act
[appropriated](https://www.fedscoop.com/senate-infrastructure-bill-cyber/)
\$20 million for the Cyber Response and Recovery Fund to be used during
a significant cyber incident. With money, authority, and vision the
United States has a real opportunity move the needle on cyber
resiliency. An effective plan should bring the states and their homeland
security and emergency management offices together with the federal
Department of Homeland Security. It should also involve funding, regular
exercise at a regional and national level, and the collection of lessons
learned. Building out the regional offices would be powerful because at
the regional level, there is intimate knowledge of business, critical
infrastructure, and the general risk landscape. But it requires even
more people, money, and systems connectivity, as well as a mechanism for
regular situational awareness. Trust Is Key [Going out to the where its
customers are located would dramatically expand the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency's effectiveness]{.underline}. Additional
representatives --- leaders, analysts, and advisors --- should be
embedded at the local levels to build relationships, broker trust, and
ensure that businesses that participate in public private partnerships
see a return on their investment. [For the system to work, **regional
offices should bring in cybersecurity analysts and operators from
surrounding state and local governments and members of the private
sector to create mission-driven teams with their own esprit de
corps**]{.underline}. They should give non-federal entities seats at the
table as equals and better access to government leaders and timely
intelligence. Teams that know and trust each other will have an easier
time sharing intelligence and responding to incidents together. Right
now, collaboration isn't happening at the scale the country requires
because the structures are simply not in place. Build the structures and
the culture, unify the effort, and results will follow. [While the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's **recent outreach
efforts have elevated public awareness of available resources, there
still remains work to be done in ensuring that America has timely access
to the necessary federal resources in the case of a
cyberattack.**]{.underline} As former agency director Chris Krebs
[noted](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/toward-collaborative-cyber-defense-and-enhanced-threat-intelligence-structure),
"the future of CISA is in the field." To defend the networks on which
the country relies and recover quickly from inevitable attacks, America
needs nodes that can aggregate and share threat information and promote
effective responses at the local and regional levels.

Aware of the "strategic atrophy" induced by information and cyber
warfare, particularly by China and Russia, the [U.S. Army proffered the
concept of multi-domain operations, to include cyberspace as one of its
defining arenas.]{.underline} It outlines measures to beef up the
integration of technologies and cyber domains with its allies. The U.S.
army chief of staff envisages enhanced "military-to-military exchanges,"
further "intelligence sharing" and more overseas exercises, and mutual
procurement of services among allies. The AUKUS deal, a defense pact to
ramp up the exchange of nuclear and cyber technology between Australia,
the U.K., and the U.S., and the Quad alliance intended to contain China
are the most recent trendsetters. Regardless of the necessity of
presenting a unified resolve, [however, more integrated alliances will
multiply access points for hackers to tap into the collective pool of
security]{.underline} in the absence of robust cybersecurity postures
among all the parties involved. Despite the tech pomp, Kim Won-jong, an
AI researcher at the Korea Army Research Center for Future and
Innovation, observes that ["their timeline for AI application outpaces
adequate cyber defense."]{.underline} In addition, the allies' haphazard
distribution of intelligence and technology, along with inept cyber
defenses, augur ill. The consequences can be dire. ["Once the
adversaries successfully hack our AI systems]{.underline}," Kim
continues, "[they control our modus operandi however they want by
injecting their own commands into our machinery." Under those
circumstances, system failure is the best-case scenario]{.underline},
while a "reversal between control and subjection" means bedlam. Yet
[cooperation to secure cutting-edge technologies has lagged behind the
development of these systems.]{.underline} Even with the increasing
level of research and intelligence exchange between South Korea and the
United States, the first-ever Cyber Cooperation Working group will
convene as of 2022. Although state direction and the sheer volume of
research outputs do not necessarily guarantee quality and creativity,
developments in military cyberspace paint a picture of China as a real
cyber threat. Enshrined as one of [China's main strategic priorities,
technology espionage through hacking offers "a cheaper and easier path
to threatening America's sources of military power]{.underline}." China
employs machine learning and AI algorithms to replicate a defense model
of the target, quarrying the ideal attack sequence and rehearsing
optimized forms of hacking. Then, it parlays the information gained
through the cyberattack into military capabilities. Conversely, "[there
has not yet been a uniform effort to integrate AI assurance across the
entire U.S. national security enterprise]{.underline}," according to a
report by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
In October 2021, Nicolas Chaillan resigned from his post as chief
software officer for the U.S. Department of Defense, citing the
"technology stale" approach that plagues the United States' cyber
defense. "Outdated" bureaucratic principles deprive the workforce of its
capacity to leverage "diversity of options." His desire to upend a work
environment where DOD employees are "unempowered to fix basic IT issues"
jives with the call from In Jun-beom for cybersecurity forces to be
allowed to think outside the box and make breakthroughs in their
country's defense paradigm. Considering the bullish Chinese assertion of
its cyber capability and the incompetence of technology "laggards" on
the U.S. part, Chaillan remarks that the [U.S. and its allies "will have
no chance competing" against China unless it adopts a culture of
"agility, rapid prototyping and innovation.]{.underline}" As NSCAI puts
it in its sobering assessment, "the U.S. government is not prepared to
defend the United States in the coming artificial intelligence (AI)
era."

[Revitalizing the U.S. alliance system will also require operational
innovation]{.underline}. Despite talk of creating an "Indo-Pacific
Charter" or transforming the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or "Quad"
(which includes the U.S., Australia, Japan, and India) into a formal
alliance, such musings are little more than a pipe dream. It is neither
practical nor useful to imagine variations on a NATO model for the
Pacific. However, deterring China must be understood as a multilateral
task that will require the collective capacity of the U.S. and key
allies in both Europe and Asia. They will also need to adopt a broader
understanding of collective defense, addressing deterrence requirements
across a continuum that includes new sub-conventional and non-kinetic
threats alongside conventional military challenges. There may be lessons
learned from the NATO context that could provide insight into how best
to build new operational models more suited to the Indo-Pacific[. This
could include multi-national staff colleges akin to the NATO Defense
College to foster exchanges on joint doctrine and strategic planning, or
an expanded use of allied liaisons within national defense institutions
or command structures]{.underline}. It could include multi-national
training centers that allow allies to engage in high-end deterrence
exercises, or international logistics hubs similar to NATO's Strategic
Airlift Capability (SAC) in Hungary. In these and other areas, there are
opportunities to build coalition capability in the Pacific that adapt
NATO functions without replicating its form. Beyond building collective
capacity to operate more seamlessly in response to today's crises, [the
U.S. must also think more closely about building alliance innovation
ecosystems for the future. With China set to overtake the U.S. in
research and development spending --- it already spends more on R&D than
Japan, Germany, and South Korea combined]{.underline} [--- the U.S. and
its allies will need to treat defense innovation as a combined
task]{.underline}. Rising techno-nationalism and the lack of allied
innovation networks will make this difficult absent intentional policy
leadership. Looking forward, [Washington should further expand new
bureaucratic mechanisms such as allied R&D pools or defense innovation
hubs that could better harness emerging technologies being developed
across allied capitals]{.underline}. While the Defense Department is
focused on initiatives that will improve America's sclerotic acquisition
and innovation processes, these efforts need an alliance-centric
approach from inception, rather than treating allies as an add-on to
existing American plans. NATO, for example, might consider establishing
an allied version of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA), in which key allies could collaborate on emerging technologies,
as proposed by the 2017 GLOBSEC NATO Adaptation Initiative. Indo-Pacific
allies such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea could be incorporated
in this initiative through their role as NATO "global partners."

#### NATO stretched too thin - should focus on Russia and terror instead

https://www.brookings.edu/research/retooling-americas-alliances-to-manage-the-china-challenge/

As the United States and its allies explore the best way to meet the
China challenge, they will need to grapple with three existential
questions: Does NATO have a role to play in dealing with China? Because
no other military institution provides the same degree of multinational
interoperability and capacity, NATO has become a first responder on the
global stage many times since the end of the Cold War: delivering
humanitarian and medical assistance after the 2004 Indonesian tsunami
and during the current COVID-19 pandemic; conducting counterterrorism
operations in the Mediterranean and counterpiracy operations in the
Indian Ocean; using military force to protect civilian populations in
the Balkans in the 1990s and in Libya in 2011; overseeing post-conflict
stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan; and
deterring Russian aggression against Eastern Europe. [The plethora of
missions]{.underline} is in large part due to the lack of alternatives
globally. It [has also led to concerns]{.underline}, however[, that
**NATO is stretched too thin.**]{.underline} China has now been added to
the alliance's ever-expanding agenda, providing a surprising point of
agreement in an otherwise contentious December 2019 NATO summit, at
which NATO members committed the alliance for the first time to deal
with China's "growing influence and international policies." In April
2020, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg charged an independent
"Reflection Group" with preparing a report eyeing the future; released
in November, the "NATO 2030" document put the challenge in stark terms:
"China is... best understood as a full-spectrum systemic rival, rather
than a purely economic player or an only Asia-focused security actor."
Obvious questions remain about the precise role NATO should play
vis-à-vis China. There are certainly a host of global security concerns
--- ranging from China's presence in Africa and South Asia to its
influence in space and cyberspace --- where NATO coordination would be
valuable[. It is unclear]{.underline}, however[, what role NATO could,
or would, play in an Asian military crisis with Beijing. NATO allies
have limited military capabilities they could bring to bear in the
Pacific, and few European partners would be eager to be pulled into a
conflict in places like Taiwan or the South China Sea]{.underline}.
Given that Article V of the 1949 Washington Treaty refers to "an armed
attack against one or more \[NATO members\] in Europe or North
America[," a **Pacific** conflict, even involving U.S. forces,
would]{.underline} technically **[fall outside NATO's
scope]{.underline}**. But in a spiralling crisis that would implicate
Europe's strategic and economic interests, could NATO afford to remain
on the sidelines? At a minimum, Europe could play a valuable role in the
political, economic, or even cyberspace arenas. As European allies seek
a bigger role in the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. needs to engage them in more
frank discussions about these types of scenarios, creating clearer
expectations about how different parties might respond before any such
conflict appears on the horizon, rather than after one has erupted.
Beyond the question of NATO's role in Asia[, there are also tradeoffs
associated with European partners seeking a more prominent role in the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} Encouraging more regular European military
deployments to the Indo-Pacific, while they would be welcomed in Asia,
[could **detract from NATO's focus** on Eastern Europe to **deter
Russian aggression** or in the Middle East to engage in
**counterterrorism missions**.]{.underline} These are areas where
Europeans will need to shoulder more of the burden in the coming years
as the U.S. continues to rebalance its foreign policy to Asia.

### CP Key

#### CP is crucial to surpassing China in AI.

Security. April 7, 2021.

R&D = research and development

In order to improve U.S. A.I. policy, it is vital that the Biden
administration understands two points. First, [**greater R&D spending**
is **necessary to ensure that the United States can keep up with China
on A.**I.]{.underline} For the most part, the new administration has
embraced this: Biden's campaign
[reiterated](https://fortune.com/2020/11/10/biden-harris-administation-artificial-intelligence/)
former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's assertion that the United States must
boost tech R&D because ["China is on track to surpass the U.S. in R&D."
It even went on to claim that China's main reason for investing in new
technologies was to "overtake American technological primacy and
dominate future industries]{.underline}." Second, [because American
allies are themselves investing heavily into A.I., **it is prudent to
adopt multilateral solutions which leverage the United States' historic
alliances as opposed to unilateral "America first"
responses**]{.underline}**.** For instance, Germany's "A.I. Made in
Germany" plan has
[allocated](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/cognitive-technologies/ai-investment-by-country.html#endnote-17)
€3 billion to A.I. research over the next five years, while France's
"A.I. for Humanity" initiative has injected €1.5 billion into the
sector. To balance against China's advancements, the United States
should take advantage of these alliances and ensure that global
investments go into developing A.I. capabilities across the broader
liberal democratic sphere. This second necessity does not appear to have
received as much attention from the Biden administration so far. Despite
its general recommitment to multilateralism through rejoining the Paris
Climate Accord, reprioritizing NATO, and [calling
for](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2021/02/19/the-democracy-summit-must-be-paired-with-a-democracy-strategy/)
a "Summit for Democracy," the Biden administration has largely
overlooked the idea of multilateral cooperation on A.I. research. To
match the Chinese technological challenge, the United States must
establish research initiatives alongside its historic allies which will
benefit U.S. A.I. development. This will have the effect of protecting
U.S. national security long into the future by guaranteeing that the
United States retains the edge over China in crucial A.I. innovations.
At the center of this policy should be an upgraded equivalent of China's
"thousand talents" scheme that would be run as a joint initiative
between America and its allies. The European Union, United Kingdom,
Australia, and Japan's determination to invest heavily into A.I., paired
with their historic ties to the United States, suggests potential for
large-scale multilateral research collaboration led by the United
States. The Biden administration should therefore suggest the foundation
of a multilateral research program---call it "One Thousand and One
Talents"---with the aim of attracting the best A.I. specialists from
around the globe. Participating governments would funnel their annual
A.I. budgets into the scheme in order to fund research projects with
important military and commercial applications. The program would ensure
that salaries would be directly competitive with China's "thousand
talents" program and that incentives would be put in place to make the
Western alternative more attractive than the Chinese one. [Like NATO,
U.S. leadership would be justified by its status as the main benefactor
of the scheme. **The emphasis on multilateralism as a response to
U.S.-Chinese competition should come as no surprise**.]{.underline} As
Princeton professor John Ikenberry
[writes](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2008-01-01/rise-china-and-future-west),
the key thing for U.S. leaders to remember when dealing with China is
that "[it may be possible for China to overtake the United States alone,
but it is **much less likely that China will ever manage to overtake the
Western order**."]{.underline} It is no different with A.I. The new
technological challenges facing America call for a far-sighted and
judicious foreign policy worthy of the world's greatest superpower.
While [China]{.underline} may have the advantages of unrestricted State
investment and well-planned incentive programs, it [[lacks
alliances](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/07/08/5-reasons-china-has-no-friends/)
that run as deep as the NATO friendships the United States has long
depended on. To overcome current Chinese advancements in A.I., the
**United States** must **unite with its partners** around the world in
order to **increase the talent, funding, and skill available** to
it.]{.underline} The proposed "Thousand And One Talents" research scheme
would boost the United States' competitiveness vis-a-vis China by
pooling the resources of some of the wealthiest and most technologically
advanced nations into U.S.-led A.I. development. Given the inevitability
of China's rise, multilateral cooperation with like-minded democracies
is the only way of ensuring that the U.S. does not face an existential
security threat in the future. The Biden administration must rise to the
challenge by uniting with U.S. allies to compete with China on A.I. It
is too risky to go it alone.

https://www.brookings.edu/research/retooling-americas-alliances-to-manage-the-china-challenge/

The first step in creating more capable 21st century alliances is to
return to basics: focusing on the defense of allied sovereignty. While
allies can and should play important roles addressing violent extremism
in the Middle East or engaging in partner capacity-building efforts in
Africa[, the principal focus of U.S. alliances in Europe and Asia should
be to maintain a credible deterrence and self-defense capability. This
will require greater investments by U.S. allies in their own defense,
but it will also require a greater willingness in Washington to **allow
allies to take the lead in their own regions.**]{.underline} Despite
Europe's continued dependence on the United States, it is time for a
reconceptualization of the trans-Atlantic relationship. NATO's
continuation after the end of the Cold War was a way of keeping America
in charge of European security during an uncertain period after the
Soviet collapse. Europe's failure to stop genocide in the former
Yugoslavia in the early 1990s was another reminder of the continent's
dependence on Washington, which finally put an end to the killings[.
Moving forward, NATO's success should be measured by its ability to
shift from serving as a vehicle for U.S. dominance over European
security to an entity that enables the U.S. to assist European-led
defense efforts in a more balanced partnership.]{.underline} In October
2020, German Minister of Defense Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer spoke of
Germany's continued dependence on the U.S. for nuclear deterrence, but
declared that her country's defense budget would continue to rise
despite pressures caused by the pandemic. She argued it was time for
Germany, and Europe, to do more: ["We Europeans will have to do
ourselves much of what America has largely done for us so far, by
diplomatic and by conventional military means. Securing NATO's eastern
flank. Crisis management operations in our immediate neighborhood
outside of Europe. Air and sea surveillance... **We stay dependent, but
at the same time, we must come into our own."**]{.underline} If [the
U.S]{.underline}. is going to succeed in rebalancing its defense posture
toward Asia, it [needs a stronger Europe able to take the lead in its
broader neighborhood. Fears that European efforts to build greater
capacity will undermine NATO are overblown and only relevant in a world
in which U.S. dominance over European security --- rather than the
capacity of European allies to manage their own security challenges with
less reliance on the United States --- is the primary goal. The U.S.
needs to continue encouraging its allies to move out of a supporting
role in the Indo-Pacific as well.]{.underline} In light of the rapidly
advancing military threat from both China and North Korea, [U.S. allies
will need to **play a larger role in not only their own self-defense**,
but also in the region]{.underline}. An increasing tempo of allied air
and maritime presence operations will be particularly valuable in the
coming decade as the United States looks to address needed modernization
requirements that may reduce its bandwidth for steady state operations.
If the U.S. wants to "shift" the defense burden and credibly deter
Beijing, it should also explore new ways to make it easier for U.S.
allies to obtain the capabilities they need. This should include
breaking down outdated bureaucratic hurdles, export control rules, and
technology transfer restrictions that can make it difficult for U.S.
allies to compete more effectively with Beijing. Equally important, many
of these restrictions often incentivize U.S. allies to pursue autonomous
capabilities outside of the alliance, rather than in tandem with
Washington. Finally[, focusing on domestic resilience in space,
**cyberspace**, and technological systems will create additional
incentives for allies to work together. The threat **China** poses in
these arenas as it **seeks to take the lead in** 5G and artificial
intelligence **(AI)** is becoming more apparent to allies in Asia and
Europe:]{.underline} this is one area that can foster greater consensus
despite allied disagreement on the political and economic challenges
that Beijing poses.

### China Leading Now

#### American hegemony is dependent on wire-thin margins of error in tech; China poised and ready to surpass in AI

**Javers 21** (Eamon Javers, Eamon is the Senior Washington
Correspondent for CNBC, OCT 22 2021, "America must protect these 5
technologies if it wants to remain a superpower, intelligence officials
warn," CNBC,
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/22/america-must-protect-5-crucial-technologies-to-remain-superpower-officials-warn.html)

WASHINGTON -- U.S. intelligence officials have issued a stark warning:
[**America's status as a global superpower depends on maintaining a lead
in five key tech**nologies]{.underline} -- and America's **[rivals are
trying to steal every one of them]{.underline}**. Officials said they
are concerned that [**foreign theft** of American technologies **could**
not only **rob the U**nited **S**tates **of econ**omic **leadership** in
the key sectors, but could **threaten the country's ability to** even
**remain active in the industries** at all]{.underline}. The five
technologies identified by intelligence officials are: [**A**rtificial
**i**ntelligence Quantum computing **Bioscience** Semiconductors
**Autonomous systems**]{.underline} Officials cited legal and illegal
activities, particularly those conducted by China, that have crippled
competitiveness in sectors such as steel and solar panels. They also
pointed to China's wipeout of the Australian rail industry as an
example. "We don't want what happened in those other industries to
happen here," said Michael Orlando, acting director of the National
Counterintelligence and Security Center, which falls under the Director
of National Intelligence. When asked what the impact would be if the
U.S. loses supremacy, he said: "It could be severe. We've got to focus
on these industries because we can't afford to lose them." Has the U.S.
already lost the AI battle to China? In a new report, the NCSC wrote
that "these sectors produce technologies that may determine whether
America remains the world's leading superpower or is eclipsed by
strategic competitors in the next few years." In each area, officials
said, [**adversary nations** have **used** a blend of **legal and
illegal methods** -- ranging from **hiring talent to mergers** and
acquisitions **to hacking** and old-fashioned **spycraft** -- **to steal
and replicate American tech**nology.]{.underline} Over the past several
months, officials have briefed a small group of executives and academics
on the dangers to their research. Now that the report is public,
officials plan on a more aggressive outreach to industry and
universities. Officials said many private sector business leaders fail
to appreciate that the outreach they get from Chinese and Russian
entities for everything from joint ventures and partnerships to mergers
and acquisitions is part of a national strategy by those governments to
acquire those technologies and replace the American firms that are
producing them. [**Intel**ligence **agencies fear** that **U.S. firms
will** not only **lose their edge**, but will be **entirely pushed out
of the tech**nology **sectors** crucial to the 21st
century.]{.underline} "Its not just the loss of intellectual property,
but the loss of a complete business model" said Edward You, NCSC's
national counterintelligence officer for Emerging and Disruptive
Technologies. He said vulnerability is particularly acute in health
technology. "Because of our short sightedness, we may wake up one day
and discover that we have become health care crack addicts and China has
become our pusher." Their goal is to explain to companies and
universities that they are on the receiving end of a sophisticated, and
often devious, effort by foreign governments to make off with valuable
technology --- and that some transactions that appear to be simple
business deals are more dangerous to the country. "People are having
trouble understanding the bigger picture here and the ways that legal
and illegal come together," Orlando said. Any particular deal could be
attractive on the individual merits, but American business leaders
should recognize that these offers aren't coming on the merits. "It
wasn't just because it was a good investment," he said. "It was because
it was part of this larger plan." Intelligence officials, however,
stopped short of recommending "decoupling" the U.S. and Chinese
economies or of stopping the flow of students and employees from China
and Russia, citing an awareness that collaboration can be mutually
beneficial. An overall area of concern is the United States losing its
ability to develop and manufacture its own supply chain of biological
and health care supplies --- a vulnerability that became all too clear
during the Covid-19 pandemic and could be even worse during the next
one, according to You. "We're dependent on them," he said. "They could
develop a countermeasure before anybody else does. An effective defense
is the equivalent of an offense. They can withhold supply like they did
with masks. They have all the strategic advantages." The report found
[that **China** "possesses the might, talent and ambition to
**potentially surpass the U.S. as the world's leader in AI in the next
decade if current trends do not change**]{.underline}**.**" Officials
cited the 2020 U.S. indictment of two Chinese hackers working with the
Chinese Ministry of State Security for their part in a 10-year hacking
campaign against a wide range of Western targets, including a UK-based
AI firm. Officials also expressed concern about Russia, citing MIT's
2019 announcement that it would extend its partnership with Russia's
Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology and the Skolkovo
Foundation. MIT said the partnership would focus on "strengthening
research collaborations between individual faculty members at the two
institutions." American officials pointed out that the U.S. Treasury
Department imposed sanctions on Viktor Vekselberg, who headed the
Skolkovo Foundation, in 2018. (The university removed him from its Board
of Trustees after the sanctions announcement.) The intelligence
community report found that quantum computers --- which can, in
principle, use the unique properties of atoms and photons to solve
certain problems much faster than ordinary computers --- will pose
national security and economic challenges. "A large scale quantum
computer could potentially allow for the decryption of most commonly
used cybersecurity protocols, putting at risk the infrastructure
protecting today's economic and national security communications," the
report said. In the race to develop practical quantum computers, the
officials said, the winner will have a tremendous strategic advantage.
The report noted that foreign competitors are recruiting American
experts to advance their own quantum programs. "Whoever acquires a
quantum computer can break every encryption system we have here," said
Orlando. "And quantum radars can detect our stealth aircraft and
submarines." Officials were particularly critical of China's WuXi
Biologics, which purchased Bayer's manufacturing plant in Germany,
Pfizer's manufacturing plant in China and CMAB Biopharma Group in China.
The Chinese company is also building manufacturing plants in
Massachusetts and Ireland. "We're building or acquiring manufacturing
capacities in Ireland, the U.S., and Germany in response to growing
customer demand around the world, which are supported by local
government and communities as well," said Yixin Zhang, the assistant
director of corporate communications and public affairs at WuXi
Biologics. "Growing customer demand for biologics has required our
company, like many others in the industry, to build new facilities and
acquire existing ones in various markets." Another company, the former
parent of WuXi Biologics, has announced a plant in Delaware through a
subsidiary. Because of WuXi Biologics' enormous manufacturing capacity,
American bioscience companies that produce vaccines and other biotech
products may find themselves using Chinese controlled plants by default.
"They don't have to steal our intellectual property anymore," said You.
"If you want to scale manufacturing, we're dependent on Chinese
manufacturing, so we're going to have to give them the IP \[to produce
the products\]." The fragile nature of the semiconductor supply chain is
well known, but the report found that the U.S. is heavily dependent on a
single company in Taiwan. It also found that adversaries can get access
to the supply chain and put compromised chips in U.S. commercial and
defense systems. Officials singled out a wave of Chinese acquisitions in
the space, including Chinese private equity firm Wise Road Capital March
purchase of South Korea-based MagnaChip for \$1.4 billion. The report
concluded that autonomous systems also present a potential security
threat, by expanding the type of target hackers will be able to go after
in the future and by gathering an enormous amount of data on drivers in
the Unites States. Officials cited a September report that the Chinese
had illegally purchased an Italian-based military drone company in an
effort to gather autonomous technology. Officials flagged the 2019
arrest of a former Apple employee who was charged with stealing
autonomous vehicle secrets from Apple with plans to pass them to a
Chinese competitor.

#### China is winning the AI race -- the US [can win]{.underline} BUT it'll require a massive effort

Combining decades of experience advancing frontier technologies, on the
one hand, and analyzing national security decisionmaking, on the other,
we have been collaborating over the past year in an effort to understand
[the national security implications of China's great leap forward in
artificial intelligence (AI). Our purpose in this essay is to sound an
alarm over China's rapid progress and the current prospect of it
overtaking the United States in applying AI in the decade ahead; to
explain why **AI is for the autocracy led by the Chinese Communist
Party** (hereafter, the "Party") **an existential
priority**]{.underline}; to identify key unanswered questions about the
dangers of an unconstrained AI arms race between the two digital
superpowers; and to point to the reasons why we believe that **[this is
a race the United States can and must win.]{.underline}** We begin with
four key points. First, [most Americans believe that U.S. leadership in
advanced technologies is so entrenched that it is unassailable.
Likewise, many in the American national security community insist that
in the AI arena China can never be more than a "near-peer competitor."
Both are wrong.]{.underline} In fact, **[China stands today as a
full-spectrum peer competitor of the United States in commercial and
national security applications of AI. Beijing is not just trying to
master AI---it is succeeding.]{.underline}** Because [AI will have as
transformative an impact on commerce and national security over the next
two decades as semiconductors, computers and the web have had over the
past quarter century, this should be recognized as a matter of grave
national concern]{.underline}.1,2,3 Second, [China's zeal to master AI
goes far beyond its recognition that this suite of technologies promises
to be the biggest driver of economic advances in the next quarter
century]{.underline}. For the Party**[, AI is mission
critical]{.underline}**. [**The command of 1.4 billion citizens by a
Party-controlled authoritarian government is a herculean challenge**.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Americans have been confident that
authoritarian governments are doomed to fail---eventually. But AI offers
a realistic possibility of upending this proposition]{.underline}. [AI
could give the Party not just an escape hatch from the "end of
history,"4 but a claim to advance a model of governance---a national
operating system---superior to today's dysfunctional
democracies]{.underline}. As one former Democratic presidential
candidate put it**[: "China is using technology to perfect
dictatorship]{.underline}**."5 It's a value proposition that resonates
with many leaders around the world. As former Google ceo Eric Schmidt
has argued: "[if the Soviet Union had been able to leverage the kind of
sophisticated data observation, collection and analytics employed by the
leaders of Amazon today, it might well have won the Cold
War."]{.underline} Third, while we share the general enthusiasm about
AI's potential to make huge improvements in human wellbeing, [the
development of machines with intelligence vastly superior to humans will
pose special, perhaps even unique risks.]{.underline} In 1946, Albert
Einstein warned, "the unleashed power of the atom has changed everything
save our modes of thinking, and thus we drift towards unparalleled
catastrophe." We believe the same could be said of AI. Henry Kissinger
has identified these risks in what we call "Kissinger's Specter." In his
words, AI threatens an unpredictable revolution in our consciousness and
our thinking, and an "inevitable evolution in our understanding of truth
and reality."6 In response to Einstein's insight, the technologists and
strategists who had built and used the bomb to end World War II joined
forces to find ways to prevent a nuclear World War III. Meeting the
challenges posed by AI will require nothing less. Fourth, [China's
advantages in size, data collection and national determination have
allowed it over the past decade to close the gap with American leaders
of this industry**. It is currently on a trajectory to overtake the
United States in the decade ahead.**]{.underline} Nonetheless[**, if the
United States will awake to the challenge and mobilize a national
effort**, we believe that **it can develop and execute a winning
strategy**]{.underline}. For many readers, AI is just the latest bright,
shiny object on the technology horizon. A brief explainer to provide
some further context may be helpful. AI encompasses big data, machine
learning and multiple related technologies that allow machines to act in
ways humans describe as "intelligent" when we do the same thing.7 For
example, consider gps navigation app Waze locating the best route
through heavy traffic; Amazon's eerily relevant product suggestions; or
the programmed machines that now regularly defeat world masters in
chess. Today's leading information technology companies---including the
faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) and bats (Baidu,
Alibaba and Tencent)---are betting their r&d budgets on the AI
revolution. As Amazon's Jeff Bezos said this year, "We're at the
beginning of a golden age of AI."8

\--MV

BOSTON AND LONDON - The rivalry that has been simmering between China
and the United States, [**the world's two leaders in developing
artificial intelligence (AI) technology, is now nearing the boiling
point** as the two countries' lines of battle become drawn ever more
clearly in policy documents, white papers, and intelligence
bulletins.]{.underline} [**The US has advantages such as leading
hardware, research, and talent, whereas China has unparalleled masses of
AI-ready data at its disposal** to drive technological
development]{.underline}, a strong will to succeed in its quest for
primacy, and a head start in its already widespread deployment and
adoption of many digital technologies. Since 2017, [**China has been
producing more AI scholarly research than the US**. But in 2020, for the
first time**, China also surpassed it in AI-related journal
citations**]{.underline}, according to last year's Stanford University
AI Index Report. "Citations measure whether the ideas you're putting out
are novel and have impact - not just that you have a lot of researchers
pumping out publications," said Michael Sellitto, Stanford University
Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence deputy director and a member of
its AI Index steering committee. "The data suggests that China is making
more contributions to basic AI knowledge now, a qualitative
improvement," per the Stanford report. "I don't think they'll be number
one, because I think there's still a level of genius and creativity in
Silicon Valley that persists and will always persist," Breyer Capital
founder Jim Breyer told CNBC, likening the two superpowers' AI rivalry
to the US-Soviet space race of the 1950s. In June 2020, San
Francisco-based independent AI research lab OpenAI announced the launch
of its GPT-3, the third generation of its massive Generative Pre-trained
Transformer language model, which can write computer code, poetry, and
everything in between, various media reported at the time. A year later,
with considerably less ballyhoo, Tsinghua University's Beijing Academy
of Artificial Intelligence unveiled an even larger model, Wu Dao 2.0,
with 10 times as many parameters - the neural network values that encode
information. GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, whereas Wu Dao 2.0's
creators claim that their model has 1.75 trillion. Not only can it
generate text as GPT-3 does, but it can also generate images from text
descriptions like OpenAI's 12-billion parameter DALL-E model.
Furthermore, it has a scaling strategy that is similar to Google's 1.6
trillion-parameter Switch Transformer. Even as AI thus fuels the rivalry
between China and the US, it also is driving the two countries far ahead
of the rest of the world in innovation, economic growth, and national
power, according to the Brookings Institution, a think tank based in
Washington, DC. **[China's official statements promoting the
military-civil fusion of technological development to erode America's
competitive edge also prompt unease]{.underline}**, which is further
amplified by China's grand trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI) infrastructure program that spans nearly 140 countries and is
central to its plan to extend its global influence. The Digital Silk
Road (DSR) is a key component of the BRI and seeks to reach into the
digital sphere through the DSR's main assets - fifth-generation wireless
network communications technologies, mega data centers, AI, and
satellite navigation systems - all of which have critical ramifications
for data privacy, national security, and global cyberspace governance,
and which will endow the Chinese with the power to access, analyze, and
exploit the data of BRI recipient nations. [Some worry this will also
enable China to set global technological standards, according to the
Brookings Institution]{.underline}. China's actions have fed what Dean
Garfield, president and chief executive of the Information Technology
Industry Council, has denoted a new "hysteria" in Washington that
America is ceding its innovation edge to China. Apropos of which,
ex-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also said, "When we see
\[China\]\... say, 'We're going to do whatever it takes to surpass the
United States'\... you're going to get a response from the United
States," per the Brookings report. Much of that response has been
seeking to slow or arrest China's progress by tightened screening of
foreign investments in core technologies, scrutinizing academic
exchanges, imposing tariffs to reduce China's competitiveness in key
sectors, increasing prosecutions of Chinese for economic espionage, and
greater investment in counterintelligence. Arguments for 'decoupling'
the economic relationship between the US and China by collapsing ICT
supply chains would do just that. The US technology sector is deeply
intertwined with China's, with high-level collaboration between
researchers and engineers and rising tallies of co-authored academic
papers, and joint investments by US and Chinese venture capital firms
into AI-related firms in both countries, Brookings said. [In AI
implementation in the civil sphere, **China has greatly outpaced the
West**, open media platform China-US Focus reported last
month.]{.underline} China instituted its Social Credit System in 2014 to
monitor ordinary citizens and confer benefits or restrict privileges.
The system is run on facial recognition and Big Data analysis powered by
AI algorithms. [**China's device market is also driving innovation, most
notably in smartphones, cameras, robots, wearables, smart speakers,
automotive, smart mirrors, and computer processors. With respect to
US-China competition in the AI space, many US officials,** among them
Nicolas Chaillan, ex-chief software officer of the Air Force, **fear the
US may lose the AI race against China because the US is not funding
critical AI projects as aggressively, per the China-US Focus
report**.]{.underline} In comparison to the more centralized Chinese
research and development (R&D), most innovation in the US occurs in the
private sector and is not directly aided by the government. This
'decoupling' or disconnect often creates delays and information gaps.
[The US still leads in military AI, but this may soon change as China
continues to propel innovation with Big Data, digital surveillance, and
cloud computing. **The US holds leads in talent, research, development,
and hardware, while China surpasses in implementation, as well as data
quantity and quality, but in recent years China has** succeeded in
slowly leapfrogging the US and seems **well positioned to overtake it in
future.**]{.underline} The first country to acquire an AI 'strategic
weapon' will have a huge advantage in both security and the global
economy, per the report. China's cabinet the State Council announced a
bold plan to push its AI sector in 2017, aiming to make the country the
world\'s "major AI innovation center" by 2030. The slew of policies
which various government departments have since issued on that basis
have now coagulated into the edifice of the nation's AI governance and
support infrastructure.

### AT: Cooperation with China

#### Cooperation with China does not mean that there's no competition

Fifth, [while competing vigorously with the intention of sustaining U.S.
leadership, we must recognize at the same time the necessity of
cooperation in areas where neither the United States nor China can
secure its own minimum vital national interests without the help of the
other.]{.underline} The consequences of human energy consumption on the
climate offers a vivid illustration. If either the United States or
China keeps emitting greenhouse gases at the current rate, in one
hundred years, this could produce a biosphere in which neither nation
can survive[.]{.underline} Thus there is no viable alternative to
cooperation. The same is true in other realms including preventing third
party provocations---for example, in North Korea or Taiwan---from
dragging the United States and China into a catastrophic war; and
cooperation to prevent recurring financial crises like the Great
Recession of 2008 from cascading into another Great Depression. We
suspect there may be an analog in limiting the unconstrained advance of
AI. [**The possibility that nations could simultaneously compete
ruthlessly, on the one hand, while cooperating intensely, on the other,
sounds to diplomats like a contradiction. In the world of business,
however, it is called life**. While no one has yet developed a
felicitous term for what is sometimes called "coopetition," Apple and
Samsung offer a powerful example. The two are ruthless rivals in the
global market for smartphones (where, in fact, over the past five years
Samsung has become number one). But who is Apple's largest supplier of
components for smartphones? Samsung. Managing a relationship that is
simultaneously competitive and cooperative requires vigilance, judgment
and agility in adapting. But if, as we believe the evidence shows,
technologies on a small globe have left the United States and China with
two---and only two---options, we believe they can find ways to coexist,
however uncomfortably, if their only alternative is mutual
destruction.]{.underline}

[**The ability of the United States to compete in the 21st century
depends on U.S. leadership in data and artificial
intelligence**]{.underline} (AI). In response, [the Department of
Defense (DoD) is taking a new and much-needed approach to U.S. defense
efforts in data and AI.]{.underline} David Spirk, the departing Chief
Data Officer of the Pentagon, [made
clear](https://www.fedscoop.com/david-spirk-cdo-departing-dod/)
yesterday that the office of the Chief Digital and AI Officer (CDAO), in
addition to its other functions, will be [the successor organization
for](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Dec/08/2002906075/-1/-1/1/MEMORANDUM-ON-ESTABLISHMENT-OF-THE-CHIEF-DIGITAL-AND-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-OFFICER.PDF)
and replace DoD's
[much](https://www.fedscoop.com/jaic-dod-ai-authorities-bob-work/)-[touted](https://breakingdefense.com/2021/03/jaics-lt-gen-groen-if-we-want-ai-to-be-our-future-then-ai-has-to-be-our-present/)
Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC). While the JAIC symbolized
DoD's efforts to get smart on AI beginning in 2018, the integration of
data and AI represents a maturation of the U.S. AI approach---one that
elevates the importance of AI in national defense. The JAIC itself was
not as important as what the JAIC stood for---DoD's commitment to U.S.
defense AI leadership. In paving the way forward and getting AI on the
agenda, the JAIC succeeded. From this point on[, a more cohesive
approach to AI and data through the CDAO is more likely to accelerate AI
adoption throughout the U.S. military because it links DoD's AI efforts
with data, the fuel AI requires]{.underline}. For U.S. defense AI
adoption, in particular, [aligning these organizations could be
game-changing]{.underline}. Addressing DoD's [siloed
data](https://media.defense.gov/2021/May/10/2002638551/-1/-1/0/DEPUTY-SECRETARY-OF-DEFENSE-MEMORANDUM.PDF),
[standardizing and improving its quality and access]{.underline}, is a
precondition to having the data necessary to train algorithms for many
defense uses, and any future technologies that rely on collecting,
processing, and using information. Implementation will be critical and
heavily dependent on two things. First, to catalyze AI adoption, [**the
CDAO will need to develop close relationships with the military services
and combatant commands.** Second**, the CDAO will need to coordinate
with DoD's research and development organization**]{.underline}s, such
as the Defense Innovation Unit, leading on AI experimentation and
research. There is hard work ahead, but the new organizational design is
promising. [The office of the
CDAO](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Feb/02/2002931807/-1/-1/1/MEMORANDUM-ON-THE-INITIAL-OPERATING-CAPABILITY-OF-THE-CHIEF-DIGITAL-AND-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE-OFFICER.PDF)
brings together previously independent components of DoD: the JAIC, the
office of the Chief Data Officer, the Defense Digital Service (DDS), and
the Office of Advancing Analytics (ADVANA). The office of the Chief Data
Officer is in charge of data management and coordination, DDS finds
digital solutions for internal data and security issues, and ADVANA
aggregates data and conducts data analytics. The combination of these
offices raised questions about whether an independent JAIC was necessary
for U.S. defense AI leadership. Departing CDO Spirk [says
that](https://www.fedscoop.com/david-spirk-cdo-departing-dod/) the CDAO
will be "taking the best parts of all the organizations it is overseeing
and redistributing them for faster and better decision-making." We
agree. At present, not only is DoD's data siloed but its AI efforts and
initiatives are as well. According to the company Govini, in FY21[,
**fifteen separate departments and organizations funded and worked on AI
and AI-adjacent technologies**, often without formal coordination or
throughlines. **This has led to redundancies, gaps, inconsistencies in
application and access to data and resources,** and an overall
hodge-podge of AI efforts]{.underline}. DoD has acknowledged this and is
making organizational changes necessary to accelerate AI adoption even
more by restructuring its AI approach from the ground up. Now, [CDAO
will have teams working on policy and governance, technology
development, and rolling out data and AI for the Pentagon and the
military services, to avoid bureaucratic duplication and confusion that
could undermine the CDAO's overall authority.]{.underline} In
particular[**, bringing the data and AI teams together will improve the
data DoD needs for AI development**.]{.underline} Some might fear that
the reorganization of the JAIC's functions within the CDAO means the
United States is not as committed to the role of AI in the future of
U.S. national defense. Based on current information, this concern is
misplaced. First, the JAIC was created so the U.S. military could
effectively take advantage of the way AI will shape the future of war.
It succeeded in many ways. Recognition of the importance of AI for the
future of U.S. defense, and national security in general, is much more
widespread. The JAIC made headway on AI adoption and data literacy, with
initiatives like "[AI
101](https://www.fedscoop.com/jaic-piloting-artificial-intelligence-education-for-dod/),"
and on the data integration issue, as part of the [Artificial
Intelligence and Data
Initiative](https://breakingdefense.com/2022/02/jaic-developing-first-of-its-kind-integration-layer-for-ai-algorithms/)
(AIDA). The military services are investing more in AI and related
technologies such as autonomous systems. This, ironically, makes an
independent JAIC less necessary. Second, [**the JAIC has also faced
challenges** that the CDAO approach can address. The JAIC had multiple
missions, **including advising DoD on AI adoption, funding AI research,
and building AI tools itself.**]{.underline} The [JAIC also lacked the
authority to advance military service adoption of AI on its own, or to
itself transform the connection between AI and overall DoD policy and
strategy]{.underline}. The JAIC ended up arguably not policy-focused
enough to lead on policy, and not technically equipped enough to lead on
algorithm development. While the JAIC encouraged AI investment within
DoD, [**its existence also highlighted how the uncoordinated DoD AI
portfolio required even more organization**.]{.underline} The CDAO
approach will address some of these issues by fusing DoD data and AI
efforts, as will a growing focus on AI in other DoD components, from
Research & Engineering on the technology development side to OSD-Policy
(Office of the Secretary of Defense Policy) on the strategy and
governance side. Third, [**it is difficult to get things immediately
right when it comes to converting emerging technologies into adopted
innovations, especially for conservative institutions like**
**militaries**]{.underline}. We think about experimentation as a
critical part of how the technology invention process works, but the
same is true when it comes to transforming organizations. Given the way
data access and integration are essential to innovation, consolidating
data and AI, rather than having a specific JAIC only focused on AI, will
make technological adoption across DoD more likely. While it will
hopefully spur AI forward within the department, subsuming the JAIC into
the CDAO does come with some risks. Currently, there is a widespread
understanding that AI is essential for U.S. success in strategic
competition and defense leadership. However, we may be taking the
prioritization of AI for granted, and future DoD leaders might have a
different perspective even if the capabilities of AI tools continue to
mature and advance. If that were to happen, the absence of an
independent JAIC could lead to a withering of focus on AI, and a
downplaying of its importance and relevance, just at the key moment
advances in algorithms become more relevant for many military functions.
Reward requires risk, especially when it comes to innovation with
emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. Technology
development is not a linear process and often [involves
failure](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-04-06/perils-overhyping-artificial-intelligence)
along the way. Innovation becomes even more challenging when it requires
organizational change to facilitate adoption. Saying goodbye to the JAIC
will be bittersweet---the JAIC played a critical role in advancing the
U.S. military's emphasis on AI and set the table for what is next.
Moving forward, however, bringing the JAIC into the CDAO will create a
more integrated approach to AI and data that is likely to help the
United States achieve defense AI leadership.

### US-NATO Key

**US and NATO cooperation is key to counter cyber-threats**

**Alexander '12** (David, Correspondent in Jerusalem, New Delhi and
London. 20+ years in Washington, with stints at Pentagon, White House,
"Global cyber arms race engulfing web -- Defense official," Reuters,
April 10, 2012,
https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-defense-cyber/global-cyber-arms-race-engulfing-web-defense-official-idUSL2E8FADH320120411)-AT

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - [A global cyber arms race is engulfing
the Internet and the best way to counter the rapidly escalating threat
is combining the efforts of U.S. agencies, private firms and
international allies]{.underline}, cyber security officials said on
Tuesday. Cyber experts from across the U.S. government, speaking at a
conference at Georgetown University, said organized crime, espionage and
security activity on the Internet pose a rising threat to U.S.
intellectual property, military superiority and critical infrastructure.
"What we're looking at is a global cyber arms race," said Rear Admiral
Samuel Cox, director of intelligence at U.S. Cyber Command, which was
set up 18 months ago to protect Pentagon computer networks and conduct
offensive cyber operations if the president orders them. "It's not
proceeding at a leisurely or even a linear fashion but in fact is
accelerating. I wouldn't claim that it's following Moore's law, but the
curve looks kind of similar," he said, referring to a computer industry
rule of thumb that computer processing power doubles every couple of
years. Howard Schmidt, cyber security coordinator at the White House,
said more than \$8 trillion worth of transactions were carried over
wired and wireless networks each year. "This is not just a national
security issue," he told the conference. "It's a national security,
public safety as well as economic." [Officials said the most effective
way to counter the threat is to adopt an approach that promotes
collaboration among government agencies and reaches out to private
industry as well as international partners]{.underline}. TEAM SPORT. "To
really operate effectively in cyberspace \... it's really a team sport,"
said Steven Schleien, the principal director for cyber policy at the
Pentagon. That's why [the Defense Department has been working with
private companies and allies like NATO, Japan and South Korea to discuss
information sharing and coordinated responses]{.underline} to incidents
on the Internet, he said. NATO wants to bring all of the civilian and
military networks in the organization under the wing of the NATO
Computer Incident Response Capability by the end of 2012, which would
allow a coordinated response to cyber attacks. [The United States has
begun discussions]{.underline} on cyber security with Japan, South Korea
and New Zealand, and is working closely with the Britain and Australia
[on a "full spectrum" of cooperation in cyberspace]{.underline},
Schleien said. [The United States]{.underline} does not view arms
control treaties as a means of dealing with the problem but [would like
to see the international community agree on norms of behavior for
cyberspace]{.underline}, he said. "This is not an area where arms
control works. I don't know what we would monitor. I don't know how we
would verify anything in terms of cyber weapons or cyber tools,"
Schleien said. Discussions on norms of behavior would begin to address
the issue of how to fight proxies who carry out Internet attacks on
behalf of governments, and "hactivists," who attack computer networks
for their own political ends. "How do you deal with hactivists from your
soil?" Schleien asked. "Are you responsible as a sovereign nation for
what comes out of your country?" The issues are sensitive and complex. A
U.S. nonprofit group, for example, concluded Russian civilians acting
with advance notice of Russian military intentions carried out cyber
attacks in the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict. Some websites used to
organize those attacks were hosted in the United States.

#### NATO using leading members tech is key

**Berger '21** (Federico Berger, Junior Fellow at NDCF, "The Alliance in
the loop: NATO and Artificial Intelligence," NATO Defense College
Foundation. 12/21.
<https://www.natofoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NDCF-Paper-Berger-NATO-and-Artificial-Intelligence-151121.pdf>)

I[n a context where an enhanced AI adoption in the defense sector seems
imminent, the NATO Defense College's paper "NATO-mation" cleary outlines
a set of priorities for the Alliance to develop a coherent approach,
with some of them that should be at the very heart of the
issue.]{.underline} First of all, the Alliance should establish ethical
principles around which the development of these systems remains in-line
with the founding principles of the transatlantic bond. This would be an
opportunity to become a trend-setter in the international arena in an
ethical approach towards R&D. Second on the list, [**NATO Allies should
work together to innovate their workforce**, as the human side of the
process becomes ever more crucial in a highly interactive work
environment. A further focus should be given to Hacking for Defense-type
initiatives, **but also to the support of creative individuals and
innovators of the sector.** Third, the Alliance needs to develop new
concepts and doctrines to establish clearly which fields of AI are more
promising and attracts investments from a defense
perspective]{.underline}. To this extent, simulations, exercises, and
wargames are essential, also to develop common standards, approaches,
and priority areas among Allies. The fourth point involves maintaining
NATO and Allies' technological edge over the adversaries. Reinvigorating
investments in R&D is the very first condition, but promoting
cooperation as well as coordination on investments and reforms must not
be forgotten. Finally, the pressing issue of arms control[. The Alliance
has historically played an important role in deterrence and defence as a
forum for discussion, and the field of AI must not be an exception. With
the adoption of AI becoming pervasive and the rise of Lethal Autonomous
Weapon Systems (LAWS), **Allies should pay attention at identifying
potential multilateral solutions which preserve international
stability**. As a matter of fact, the Alliance needs more than ever
cohesion and collaboration to face the multiple challenges deriving from
technological revolutions]{.underline}. But as Ambassador d'Aboville
precisely pointed out in the NDCF Game Changers 2020 Dossier: NATO
Defense College Foundation Paper "NATO offers proven consultative
mechanisms and a unique network for collaboration on defence and
security questions, being a natural platform for collaboration. \[...\]
[But for such a debate to be productive, one has first to convince the
decision makers and the public in the Alliance that these technologies
applied to defence have an increasing momentum on their own, and, if we
want to redirect it towards our own security interests (or convince
others that there is a potential shared interest through arms control),
we cannot be complacent or ignore facts. **Denying ourselves these
capabilities will not stop potential adversaries in pursuing them for
their own interests**."]{.underline}

Limitations to Offensive Public-Private Cybersecurity Partnerships

[**US law**---specifically, 18 US Code § 1030---**prevents private
entities from hacking into another computer system**. Proponents of
hack-back policies find this law overly restrictive.]{.underline}
Indeed, frustration with current policies has led to action by the
government. [Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed
at loosening restrictions on hacking back.]{.underline} Some advocates
have gone even further by proposing modern day letters of marque
authorizing certain companies or individuals to act on behalf of the
government to disable or disrupt the attacking systems. Moreover,
**[hacking back is not as simple as it seems and there are good
arguments for a cautious approach]{.underline}**. **[While proponents of
authorizing the private sector to hack back typically also advocate for
governmental oversite, it is unclear that the government has the
capacity or the expertise to provide it.]{.underline}** Indeed, Jason
Healy and Robert Jervis have argued convincingly that US government
departments and agencies involved in cybersecurity are rarely even able
to maintain awareness of offensive cyber operations conducted by other
US government departments and agencies. Additionally, **[attribution for
cyberattacks is not easy]{.underline}**. The bad guys often originate
their attacks from innocent users' machines they have taken over,
employing bots, botnets, or zombies. Disabling or destroying the
machines hurts innocent users (they are also victims of the hackers) and
not the actual attackers. [Imagine the potential harms if an attack was
made to appear to have originated from a hospital's IT network. Hacking
back could result in real loss of life.]{.underline} Furthermore, while
there is a lot of focus on offense and the ability to strike back, too
much offense can create other problems, like instability in
international relations. **[A back-and-forth exchange of cyberattacks
between nation-states can spiral quickly beyond what either nation
intended. What started out in the cyber world can escalate into
brinkmanship and lethal force.]{.underline}** In short, the [United
States is right to be cautious with empowering private entities to act
offensively on behalf of the government]{.underline}. The past twenty
years has demonstrated that the use of [private military contractors
comes with its own issues.]{.underline} [Scandals surrounding Blackwater
and other contractors has shown what happens when government allows
privatization of inherent government functions.]{.underline}

### NATO Key

#### NATO is key for a unified response.

AL

First, it will be strategic to make a list of priorities on EDTs in two
ways. [NATO has already defined seven priority areas, but for each of
them it would be advisable to specify their level of criticality. A
distinction needs to be made between critical, significant, limited
impact and 'peripheral' technologies]{.underline}. This is no simple
task. It is an effort already developed by some allied countries, such
as the recently updated US White House list of critical technologies.
The second approach to prioritising some EDTs over others is to make an
assessment of the contribution these EDTs make to Alliance defence and
security in the short, medium and long terms. [Delineating these
timeframes can help allocate resources efficiently and avoid potential
duplication. This]{.underline} is beneficial both for NATO and for
Allies individually, and [could prevent]{.underline} the [lack of
coordination and coherence]{.underline} found in the Inspector General's
2020 audit on AI projects being developed in the US Department of
Defense. [Moreover]{.underline}, it is not only beneficial at the
tactical level: [it can also improve strategic decision-making when it
comes to determining what role NATO should play in deterring certain
technological developments by third countries.]{.underline} The second
challenge is to make innovation projects flexible and agile. The DIANA
mechanism will focus on deep technologies, which are the seven priority
areas the Alliance has already identified (artificial intelligence, big
data processing, quantum technologies, autonomy, biotechnology, novel
materials and space), making it necessary for start-ups, research teams
and technology companies participating in the network of accelerators
and testing centres in more than 20 allied countries to reinvent their
projects in the event of failure or non-delivery. Many of the partner
countries are also members of the EU. The EU-NATO Joint Declaration is
expected to be published later this year to identify lines of
cooperation. The NATO Innovation Fund, which is the world's first
multi-sovereign venture capital fund, DIANA, and the EU's European
Innovation Council should work together to enable specialised but small
start-ups to grow smoothly. Finally, perception will also be important.
Non-NATO countries from the Asia-Pacific area will attend the Madrid
Summit, including Australia, Korea, Japan and New Zealand. The first and
third cooperate bilaterally with the US through the Quad, Australia
already does so through AUKUS and the EU is working on Digital
Partnership Agreements with Korea and Japan. [Given this multiplicity of
initiatives, ensuring mutual trust and confidence in technology projects
--within NATO-- will be important for their long-term
sustainability]{.underline}. Moreover, discussions in recent years about
creating a potential NATO policy on China are still incomplete and will
be a sensitive issue, as countries have different views on how to engage
with China politically, militarily and technologically. In conclusion,
the Strategic Concept 2022 is a window of opportunity. And, as such, it
will reveal many challenges. [Working from the outset with a holistic
approach will be a necessary condition for success.]{.underline}

Social Contract Theory and Government Response

Increased **[familiarity with cyberattacks is accompanied by an
understanding of the threat they pose to all aspects of daily
life]{.underline}.** It also comes with a growing **[frustration of
what]{.underline}** many feel is an **[ineffective government response
to punish those responsible, and to thereby deter others.]{.underline}**

The United States was founded on the ideals of seventeenth-century
social contract theory, the intellectual progeny of philosophers like
Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau. They argued that citizens and governments
form a contract; the people give up certain freedoms in exchange for
government guarantees of law and order. It is this contract that allows
for societies to peacefully exist. For example, if Jill is wronged by
Jack, Jill does not take the response into her own hands, but trusts the
government to represent her interests. The alternative to the social
contract is a state of anarchy where might makes right, and thus a
failure of civil society.

One of the most [understood freedoms given up to the government under
social contract theory is security]{.underline}. **[The government is
responsible for defending society against security
threats.]{.underline}** As, the early twentieth-century theorist Max
Weber noted, a monopoly on violence is a central attribute of modern
states. Concomitantly, it should not be surprising that the US
[government has vigorously sought to defend its population against
physical violence perpetrated both by state actors, as well as by a
diverse panoply of violent nonstate actors]{.underline} (e.g., terrorist
groups and violent extremists, drug trafficking organizations). However,
in broadening the aperture beyond physical security
[threats]{.underline} to also include those emanating **[from the cyber
domain, the results become far more mixed.]{.underline}** **[While the
US government almost certainly desires to be responsive to its citizens
cybersecurity needs, it lacks a firm understanding as to how to
effectively do so.]{.underline}**

### Cooperation Good

#### Maintaining balance to US China relations key to mitigate conflict and maintain US heg

**Crawford '22** (Shannon K. Crawford, 5-26-2022, \"Blinken describes
delicate balance between isolating and enabling China,\" ABC News,
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-describes-delicate-balance-isolating-enabling-china/story?id=84992791)

[In the eyes of the Biden administration, **China is a daunting rival
and an ever-present risk to global security**. **But** it\'s **also a
necessary partner** for tackling some of the world\'s most pressing
issues. During an address laying out the president\'s policy towards
China]{.underline}, Secretary of State Antony Blinken described a
delicate balance between isolating and enabling the country, calling it
the \"[**most serious, long-term challenge\" to the global balance**.
\"**China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the
international order and increasingly, the economic diplomatic military
and technological power to do it**,]{.underline}\" he said. \"Beijing\'s
vision would move us away from the universal values that have sustained
so much of the world\'s progress over the past 75 years.\" Blinken
boiled the quagmire down into a single phrase. \"Put simply, the
[**United States and China have to deal with each other for the
foreseeable future**,\" he said. \"That\'s why this is one of the **most
complex and consequential relationships** of any that we have **in the
world** today.\"]{.underline} The secretary said that while the
administration was already employing strategies to curb China\'s
influence, it would not try to limit its growth or create new Cold War.
But while Blinken maintained that peace was its core goal, he vowed the
U.S. would not compromise it own goals. \"**[Competition need not lead
to conflict. We do not seek it. We will work to avoid it. But we will
defend our interests against any threat]{.underline}**,\" he said.
Blinken acknowledged that China had undergone meteoric growth in the
past half-century, but said its own people and other countries caught in
its crosshairs had paid the price. \"Under President Xi, the ruling
Chinese Communist Party has become more repressive at home and more
aggressive abroad,\" he said, citing mass surveillance, power grabs in
the South China Sea, widespread human rights violations, the subversion
of trade rules and more. Blinken also noted the country\'s repression of
freedom in Hong Kong, its brutal treatment of religious and ethnic
minorities in Tibet and the Xinjiang region, and its indignation over
any international criticism over draconian measures employed against its
citizens. \"Beijing insists that these are somehow internal matters,
that others have no right to raise. That is wrong,\" Blinken said. The
secretary also reaffirmed the One China policy, which was called into
question earlier this week when President Biden he would defend Taiwan
militarily before walking back his statements. Blinken said the U.S.
still acknowledges only one Chinese government, but said its posture
towards Taiwan had intensified. \"What has changed is [Beijing\'s
growing coercion by trying to cut off Taiwan\'s relations with countries
around the world and blocking it from participating in international
organizations,\" he said, adding that China regularly put on shows of
force by flying military aircraft near the island. \"These words and
actions are deeply destabilizing]{.underline}. They risk miscalculation
and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.\" For all its
commitment to its own territorial integrity, Blinken argued China\'s
unwavering alliance with Russia was hypocritical. \"Even while Russia
was clearly mobilizing to invade Ukraine, [President Xi and President
Putin declared that the friendship between their countries was and I
quote, without limits]{.underline},\" he said. Blinken repeatedly
stressed that the **[aim of the administration was not exclude China
from the world market]{.underline}**. Instead, senior administration
officials say they want to make sure it \"plays by the same rules as
everyone else.\" Blinken said that by creating dependencies, Beijing was
\"seeking to make China less dependent on the world and the world more
dependent on China.\" \"For our part, we want trade and investment as
long as they\'re fair, and don\'t jeopardize our national security,\" he
added. He warned other countries to go into trade partnerships with open
eyes, wary of retaliation should they adopt a stance China disagrees
with. \"Many of our partners already had a painful experience, how
Beijing can come down hard when they make choices that it dislikes,\" he
said. The secretary predicted the ideological battle between superpowers
would be decided in the next 10 years. \"[President Biden believes
**this decade will be decisive**,\" Blinken said, outlining the
administration\'s three pronged approach. \"The Biden administration
strategy can be summed up in three words, invest, align,
compete.]{.underline}\" Invest, he said, referred to invigorating
industry, technology and research to ensure the U.S. was up to par with
China in these arenas. Align meant strengthening ties with key allies.
Blinken said efforts to do both these things were already underway
through initiatives like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and revived
geopolitical partnerships. But to truly compete, he contended that more
needed to be done \-- calling on Congress to resolve a months\' long
stalemate and send a massive spending bill aimed at ramping up the
country\'s ability to economically contend with China to the
president\'s desk. \"[Beijing is determined to lead, but given
America\'s advantages, the **competition is ours to lose** \-- not only
in terms of developing new technologies, but also in **shaping** how
they\'re used around **the world**, so that they\'re rooted in
democratic values, not authoritarian ones,\" he implored]{.underline}.

#### China will not upend the liberal world order -- It's not important to compete with China

**Williams '21** (Michael John Williams; senior fellow with the

professor of International Affairs and director of the International
Relations Program at the Maxwell School for Citizenship and Public
Affairs at Syracuse University; September 21, 2021; Atlantic Council

DOA: 7/3/22)

The Biden administration's **[refrain of "America is
Back"]{.underline}** increasingly **[rings hollow, especially in
Europe]{.underline}**. While its decision to enter into the AUKUS pact
is logical, given its focus on China and the Asia-Pacific region, the
way it was reached [undermines the very order that the Biden team
supposedly wants to uphold]{.underline}. The **[so-called]{.underline}**
**["liberal world order"]{.underline}** (of [which the United States is
supposedly the guardian]{.underline}) **[rests upon American
hegemony]{.underline}**, which itself is premised on the consent of the
governed. The foundations of the "liberal world order" are [based on the
American hegemony in Europe and Asia established after the end of World
War II]{.underline}. Although Europe may increasingly seem less
important to many officials in Washington, it remains a fundamental base
of American legitimacy and power. Yet during a time when Washington
seeks to garner allied support to contain China, the Biden
administration needs to remember the [importance of linkages in foreign
policy]{.underline}. [France has always been one of the more
obstreperous allies]{.underline}, and thus the coarse treatment of Paris
with respect to AUKUS will set the stage for increasing discord. AUKUS
was a second strike that came on the heels of what Europeans consider to
have been a [botched withdrawal from Afghanistan]{.underline}---done
more via declaration than consultation---which incentivized European
allies to view themselves as increasingly distant from the United
States. This could have the positive effect of more European capability
development, but conversely, it [may make European allies less willing
to back the United States on other issues]{.underline}. It seems that
the Biden administration considers itself the only game in town, and
therefore it doesn't need to worry about what **[allies think, since
there's no way the European Union could reconcile itself with a
Chinese-led world order.]{.underline}** This is a dangerous assumption.
The **[American argument is]{.underline}** that **[China will upend the
liberal world order]{.underline}**. It is true that China does not place
much stock in liberal values such as human rights; it is, after all, a
market-oriented dictatorship. But t**[his doesn't mean that China is
going to upend the entire international system]{.underline}**. Instead,
it may s**[eek a global order that is more reminiscent of the past, in
which sovereignty and free-market economics reign
supreme]{.underline}**. This might not be an ideal world from a US point
of view---but it may not seem all that bad to the rest of the world.

### Competition Not Key

#### **The US doesn't need to compete with China.**

**Xu and Shen '19** (Hailin and Yi, head of Fudan University\'s
Cyberspace Governance Research Institute, "With stepped up cyberattacks
on China, US seeks online hegemony," Global Times, June 13, 2019,
https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1153909.shtml)-AT

[The US has been accusing China of being the main cybersecurity threat,
but]{.underline} based on CNCERT data, [US topped the list of sources of
such online assaults]{.underline}, Xinhua quoted an expert as saying.
[In terms of security, the US always adopts double
standards]{.underline}. In fact, it has been proved that [the US is the
**principal threat to global cybersecurity.**]{.underline} This threat
refers not only to Trojan programs that originate in the US; [it
is]{.underline} probably [the only country in the world that pursues
offensive cybersecurity strategy and considers a unipolar hegemonic
order dominated by it in cyberspace as its strategic goal]{.underline}.
What [the US is seeking]{.underline} has never been an equal order in
cyberspace, but the exclusive freedom of action and asymmetric,
[US-centered hegemonic order]{.underline}. This is the biggest threat
faced by the online world today. We should do away with assumptions that
the US is a fair, rational and responsible hegemonic power. It never
was, and that is an illusion it has tried to create. In April 2019, the
Washington D.C.-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation
found in its research that [China \"now leads the US\" in]{.underline}
some [scientific and technological areas]{.underline} compared to a
decade ago. Although there could be various motives behind the US
crackdown on Chinese high-tech enterprises that only the Americans know,
we can reasonably conclude that Washington is doing so to seek hegemony
in the internet sphere. [Washington founded the Cyber
Command]{.underline} in 2009 [and created 133 Cyber Mission Force
teams]{.underline}. Meanwhile in February, US Army General Paul
Nakasone, who also directs the National Security Agency, said he wants
to recruit more people to these teams. [These are some ways the US uses
to dominate cybespace]{.underline}, which will definitely add to its
military cyber capabilities. On the question of the US girding to launch
a cyber war, experts said there is not enough information to support the
conjecture. However, what is clear is that **[there will be no winner in
cyber warfare, and China will not be crushed given its
might]{.underline}**. Washington has listed Beijing as its main target
for cyberattacks. Such being the case, what we can do in the first place
is to improve our systematic defense capabilities at the national level.
President Xi Jinping said in his speech on cybersecurity in April 2016
that the country needs to build and perfect cyber defense and develop
its own cyber deterrence capacity. China must augment its cyber defense
and deterrence capabilities to prevent rivals from acting - just like
the nuclear sphere[.]{.underline} Such cyber capability itself is
neutral. It can be either defensive or offensive while it can be used to
either safeguard peace or dominate the world - depending on which
country masters it. As a peace-loving country, [China must have
sufficient technical capability to maintain peace and defend a just
order]{.underline}. [The US accuses China and Chinese companies of
posing a threat to its national and cybersecurity.]{.underline} In my
view, [people shouldn\'t believe]{.underline} a word of [Washington\'s
accusations]{.underline}. The US is not a conscientious hegemon but a
Janus-faced rogue. Why should we care about what the US says? The halo
of a soft power cannot preclude the US from being labeled a cyber
hegemon. US President Donald Trump\'s words and deeds have laid bare
Washington\'s real intentions.

#### American Primacy in Asia is a waste of time and resources

**Roggeveen '21** (Sam Roggeveen, Director of the Lowy Institute\'s
International Security Program, "The price of American hegemony in
Asia," IPS Journal. 29/9/21.
https://www.ips-journal.eu/topics/foreign-and-security-policy/the-price-of-american-hegemony-in-asia-5449/)

[Nobody doubts that China is the driving motivation for AUKUS. If China
was not undergoing **the most rapid maritime modernisation of any
country since the US Navy under the Reagan Administration**, it is
difficult to imagine that Washington would have agreed to sell **nuclear
technology** it has only once before shared with a foreign partner (the
UK).]{.underline} Australia has been content to demonstrate its fidelity
to its alliance with the US by supporting Washington's security goals in
the Middle East and Afghanistan. Yet that still leaves open a critical
question about US grand strategy: are agreements such as AUKUS designed
to further America's ultimate aim of maintaining its status as
unrivalled strategic leader of Asia, or is the US willing to share power
with China? It is easy to make a case for the first interpretation, at
least based on what the United States says. [The Trump Administration's
Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific, declassified in January 2021,
says plainly that the uppermost challenge for US policy in the region is
'how to maintain **US strategic primacy'**. President Biden said in
March 2021 that 'China has an overall goal \[\...\] to become \[\...\]
the most powerful country in the world \[\...\] That's not going to
happen on my watch'. Yet **rhetoric has not been matched by
action**.]{.underline} America's military footprint in Asia hasn't grown
much over the last decade, especially when compared to the rapid rise of
Chinese military capacity. [Obama's 'pivot' to Asia, announced in 2011,
is widely acknowledged to have **been under-resourced**. In that
context, AUKUS can be seen a strong sign of American commitment to
containing China.]{.underline} Nuclear propulsion technology is closely
guarded, so this is much more than an ordinary arms deal; it is a major
commitment of American technology. And if primacy is the goal, then
Australia has made its clearest commitment yet to supporting it.
Australia has been content to demonstrate its fidelity to its alliance
with the US by supporting Washington's security goals in the Middle East
and Afghanistan. [China clearly means to revise what it regards as a
Western imposed rules-based order, and it would probably like to push
the US out of the region altogether. It has, however, been less
forthright when it comes to issues that directly affect Chinese
interests]{.underline}. For instance, despite American encouragement,
Australia has still not conducted freedom of navigation missions within
12 nautical miles of China's artificial islands in the South China Sea.
It joined China's international development bank while Washington
remained suspicious. And in 2019 the suggestion that the US might ask
Australia to host American intermediate-range missiles on its territory
was met with a swift denial by the Morrison Government. That period of
reticence appears to be over. As well as the submarine deal, the
Australian government is encouraging speculation about permanent
American bases in Australia[**. Is American primacy in Asia worth it?**
What's troubling about this is that it implies full confidence in
America's ability to win such a contest for leadership in Asia, and that
Australia must do what it can to ensure victory. But China is the
biggest challenger the US has ever faced.]{.underline} As former
Brookings scholar and now China adviser in the National Security Council
Rush Doshi has observed, in the last century no American adversary or
coalition of adversaries has ever reached 60 percent of US GDP. China
passed that mark as early as 2014. It's an arresting statistic, which
should encourage Australian policy-makers to ask if the maintenance of
American primacy in Asia is a realistic or even worthwhile goal. US
primacy has certainly been advantageous for Australia, but the price of
keeping America at the top is now rising dramatically. [European powers
should also be asking themselves about their interests in
Asia.]{.underline} Australia's decision to commit to either American or
British nuclear-powered submarines meant that the deal to buy French
boats had to be cancelled, leading to much introspection about France's
future role in the Pacific. Britain's involvement in AUKUS has also
raised questions about its ambitions in this part of the world[. In
June, NATO identified China as a 'systemic challenger'. But **it is
difficult to see what vital strategic interest is at stake for NATO and
the European powers in Asia**. China clearly means to revise what it
regards as a Western imposed rules-based order, and it would probably
like to push the US out of the region altogether. However, that **is not
enough reason for Europe to involve itself in a power struggle against a
nation that offers massive economic opportunity, but which poses no
military threat** to Europe.]{.underline}

As Russia threatens the largest land invasion in Europe since World War
II, the most consequential strategic question of the 21st century is
becoming clear[: How can the United States manage two revisionist,
autocratic, nuclear-armed great powers (Russia and China)
simultaneously?]{.underline} The answer, according to many politicians
and defense experts, is that Washington must moderate its response to
Russia in Europe to focus on the greater threat posed by China in the
Indo-Pacific. This would be a mistake. [**The United States** remains
the world's leading power with global interests, and it **cannot afford
to choose between Europe and the Indo-Pacific.**]{.underline} Instead[,
Washington and its allies should develop a defense strategy capable of
deterring and, if necessary, defeating Russia and China at the same
time.]{.underline} In recent weeks, Biden has sent several thousand U.S.
troops to reinforce NATO's eastern flank---and for good reason. A major
war in Ukraine could spill across international boundaries and threaten
the seven NATO allies that border Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine.
Moreover, if Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeds in Ukraine, why
would he stop there? Putin has shown a clear interest in resurrecting
the former Russian Empire, and other vulnerable Eastern European
countries---Poland, Romania, or the Baltic states---might be next. [A
successful Russian incursion into a NATO ally's territory could mean the
end of the Western alliance and the credibility of U.S. security
commitments globally.]{.underline} [The threat posed by China is also
serious]{.underline}. Adm. Philip Davidson, former commander of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, predicted China could invade Taiwan within the
next six years[. This is a war the United States might
lose]{.underline}. [If China succeeds in taking Taiwan, it would be well
on its way to disrupting the U.S.-led order in Asia, with an eye to
doing the same globally. Moreover, Russia and China are increasingly
working together.]{.underline} As this month's summit between Putin and
Chinese President Xi Jinping shows, Moscow and Beijing are forging a
closer strategic partnership, including on military matters. These
dictators could coordinate dual attacks on the U.S. alliance structure
or opportunistically seize on the distraction provided by the other's
aggression. In other words, there is a serious risk of simultaneous
major-power wars in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific. To address this
problem, many have proposed answers that simply will not work. The Biden
administration initially hoped to put relations with Russia on a "stable
and predictable" footing to focus on China, but Putin had other ideas,
as the world is now seeing in Ukraine. Unfortunately, Washington does
not get to decide how its adversaries sequence their aggression. Others
have expressed hope that Washington can peel these powers apart or even
align with Russia against China, but these are not realistic solutions.
The misguided view gaining the most recent acceptance, however, is that
Washington should simply choose the Indo-Pacific over Europe.
Politicians and experts argue that the United States lacks the resources
to take on both Russia and China. They point to China's power and Asia's
wealth and argue that Asia should be the priority. While Washington
pivots to Asia, wealthy European countries, such as Germany, should step
up to provide for NATO's defense. Indeed, the Biden administration's
National Defense Strategy, which has been delayed due to the Ukraine
crisis, is expected to focus on China without offering a clear solution
to the two-front-war problem. A good strategy, however, starts with
clear goals, and Washington's objectives are to maintain peace and
stability in both Europe and Asia. U.S. interests in Europe are too
significant to let them be worked out solely between Putin and the
United States' European allies. Indeed, the European Union, not Asia, is
the United States' largest trade and investment partner, and this
imbalance is much starker when China (which the United States seeks
greater economic decoupling from), is removed from the equation.
Furthermore, China has conducted military exercises in Europe and the
Middle East. Competing with China militarily means competing globally,
not just in Asia. In addition, Xi is gauging U.S. resolve, and a weak
response in Ukraine might make a Chinese move on Taiwan more likely.
[Moreover, the United States is not France; it is not compelled to make
gut-wrenching strategic choices about its national security due to
constrained resources. In short, publishing a defense strategy that can
only handle one of the United States' great-power rivals (which is what
is expected from the forthcoming national defense strategy) is planning
to fail. Instead, the United States and its allies must design a defense
strategy capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating both Russia
and China in overlapping time frames. The pause in releasing Biden's
defense strategy provides an opportunity to go back to the drawing board
and get this right.]{.underline} To be sure[, developing such a strategy
will be challenging, but there are a number of ways to begin to square
the circle]{.underline}. First, Washington should increase defense
spending. Contrary to those who claim that constrained resources will
force tough choices, [the United States can afford to outspend Russia
and China at the same time]{.underline}. The United States possesses 24
percent of global GDP compared to a combined 19 percent in China and
Russia. This year, the United States will spend \$778 billion on defense
compared to only \$310 billion in Russia and China. Moreover, [the
United States could go so far as to double defense spending (currently
2.8 percent of GDP) and still remain below its Cold War average (close
to 7 percent of GDP).]{.underline} Indeed, given that this new Cold War
is every bit as dangerous as the last one, a meaningful increase in
defense spending, focused on the 21st century's emerging defense
technologies, is in order. Some might argue that the days of a U.S.
economic advantage are numbered due to China's rise, but China's
internal dysfunctions are catching up with it. Dictators like Xi
prioritize political control over economic performance. Xi is
undermining China's growth model by cracking down on the private sector
and rolling back liberalizing reforms, and his aggressive diplomacy is
upsetting international economic relationships. As a result, Beijing's
economy is stagnating. Russia's long-term economic outlook is even
worse. In short, even if this new strategic competition becomes a
two-versus-one arms race, Washington is likely to prevail. In addition,
[the United States can actively lead its allies in Europe and the
Indo-Pacific to develop a free world defense strategy]{.underline}. The
United States and its formal treaty allies possess nearly 60 percent of
global GDP, and together, they can easily marshal the resources to
maintain a favorable balance of military power over both China and
Russia. Preexisting formal alliances like NATO in Europe and bilateral
alliances in Asia can be supplemented with new arrangements, such as the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. European allies should invest in armor
and artillery while Asian allies buy naval mines, harpoon missiles, and
submarines. Allies do need, therefore, to step up and do more for their
defense, but they will not do it on their own if the United States
threatens to leave Europe. Instead, Washington should actively lead,
moving from a model where Washington provides defense to allies to one
where Washington contributes to allies' self-defense. This should
include incorporating key allies into military planning, sharing
responsibilities, and devising a rational division of labor for weapons
acquisition. European allies should invest in armor and artillery while
Asian allies buy naval mines, harpoon missiles, and submarines. The U.S.
Army should prioritize Europe while the U.S. Navy takes the Indo-Pacific
and a larger U.S. Air Force plays a significant role in both theaters.
In addition, the United States should provide strategic capabilities
like its nuclear umbrella; global conventional strike capabilities,
including hypersonic missiles; and intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance. Finally, if necessary, Washington could always take a
page from its Cold War playbook and rely more heavily on nuclear weapons
to offset the local, conventional advantages of its rivals. The presence
of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in Europe helped deter the massive
Soviet Red Army for decades. Similarly, the United States could rely on
threatening nonstrategic nuclear strikes to deter and, as a last resort,
thwart a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan or a Russian tank
incursion into Europe[. To be sure, there are risks associated with
nuclear deterrence, but nuclear weapons have played a foundational role
in U.S. defense strategy for three-quarters of a century---and will
likely continue to do so for decades to come. **Deterring China and
Russia at the same time will not be easy, but it is better than
pretending Washington can deal with one major-power rival or the other
at its convenience**. Thank goodness, former U.S. President Franklin
Roosevelt did not choose victory in only one theater during World War
II. **Biden should** follow his exampl**e and plan to defend U.S.
interests in Europe and the Indo-Pacific at the same
time.**]{.underline}
