1.2. THE ETHICS OF EXISTENTIAL RISK In his book Reasons and Persons,
Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit advanced an influential argument about
the importance of avoiding extinction: I believe that if we destroy
mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people
think. [Compare three outcomes: (1) Peace. (2) A nuclear war that kills
99% of the world's existing population. (3) A nuclear war that kills
100%.]{.underline} (2) would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse
than (2). Which is the greater of these two differences? [Most people
believe that the greater difference is between (1) and (2).]{.underline}
[I believe that the difference between (2) and (3) is very much
greater]{.underline}. \... [The Earth will remain habitable for **at
least another billion years**.]{.underline} [Civilization began only a
few thousand years ago.]{.underline} [If we do not destroy mankind,
these few thousand years may be only **a tiny fraction** of the whole of
civilized human history.]{.underline} [The difference between (2) and
(3) may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the
rest of this history.]{.underline} [If we compare this possible history
to a day, what has occurred so far is only a **fraction of a
second**.65]{.underline} In this argument, it seems that Parfit is
assuming that the survivors of a nuclear war that kills 99% of the
population would eventually be able to recover civilisation without
long-term effect. As we have seen, this may not be a safe assumption --
but for the purposes of this thought experiment, the point stands. [What
makes existential catastrophes especially bad is that they would
"**destroy the future**," as]{.underline} another Oxford philosopher,
Nick [Bostrom, puts it.]{.underline}66 [This future could potentially be
extremely long and full of flourishing, and would therefore have
extremely large value.]{.underline} In standard risk analysis, when
working out how to respond to risk, we work out the expected value of
risk reduction, by weighing the probability that an action will prevent
an adverse event against the severity of the event. [Because the value
of preventing existential catastrophe is so vast, even a tiny
probability of prevention has huge expected value.]{.underline}67 Of
course, there is persisting reasonable disagreement about ethics and
there are a number of ways one might resist this conclusion.68
Therefore, it would be unjustified to be overconfident in Parfit and
Bostrom's argument. [In some areas, government policy does give
significant weight to future generations.]{.underline} For example, in
assessing the risks of nuclear waste storage, governments have
considered timeframes of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even a
million years.69 Justifications for this policy usually appeal to
principles of intergenerational equity according to which future
generations ought to get as much protection as current generations.70
Similarly, widely accepted norms of sustainable development require
development that meets the needs of the current generation without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs.71 [However, when it comes to existential risk, it would seem that
we fail to live up to principles of intergenerational
equity.]{.underline} [Existential catastrophe would not only give future
generations less than the current generations; **it would give them
nothing**.]{.underline} Indeed, [reducing existential risk plausibly has
a quite low cost for us in comparison with the huge expected value it
has for future generations.]{.underline} In spite of this, relatively
little is done to reduce existential risk. [Unless we give up on norms
of intergenerational equity, they give us a strong case for
significantly increasing our efforts to reduce existential
risks.]{.underline} 1.3[. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE SYSTEMATICALLY
UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY]{.underline} [In spite of the importance of existential risk
reduction, it probably receives less attention than is
warranted.]{.underline} As a result, concerted international cooperation
is required if we are to receive adequate protection from existential
risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be underinvested in
[There are several reasons why existential risk reduction is likely to
be underinvested in.]{.underline} [Firstly, it is a global public
good.]{.underline} [Economic theory predicts that such goods tend to be
underprovided.]{.underline} [The benefits of existential risk reduction
are widely and indivisibly dispersed around the globe from the countries
responsible for taking action.]{.underline} Consequently, a country
which reduces existential risk gains only a small portion of the
benefits but bears the full brunt of the costs. Countries thus have
strong incentives to free ride, receiving the benefits of risk reduction
without contributing. As a result, too few do what is in the common
interest. [Secondly]{.underline}, as already suggested above,
[existential risk reduction is an intergenerational public good: most of
the benefits are enjoyed by future generations who have no say in the
political process.]{.underline} [For these goods, the problem is
temporal free riding: the current generation enjoys the benefits of
inaction while future generations bear the costs. Thirdly]{.underline},
many [existential risks]{.underline}, such as machine superintelligence,
engineered pandemics, and solar geoengineering, [pose an unprecedented
and uncertain future threat.]{.underline} Consequently, it is hard to
develop a satisfactory governance regime for them: there are few
existing governance instruments which can be applied to these risks, and
it is unclear what shape new instruments should take. In this way, our
position with regard to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we
faced when nuclear weapons first became available. [Cognitive biases
also lead people to underestimate existential risks.]{.underline} [Since
there have not been any catastrophes of this magnitude, these risks are
not salient to politicians and the public.]{.underline}72 [This is an
example of the misapplication of the availability heuristic, a mental
shortcut which assumes that something is important only if it can be
readily recalled. Another cognitive bias affecting perceptions of
existential risk is scope neglect.]{.underline} In a seminal 1992 study,
three groups were asked how much they would be willing to pay to save
2,000, 20,000 or 200,000 birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The
groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88, respectively.73 In this case, the
size of the benefits had little effect on the scale of the preferred
response. [People become numbed to the effect of saving lives when the
numbers get too large.]{.underline} 74 [Scope neglect is a particularly
acute problem for existential risk because the numbers at stake are so
large.]{.underline} [Due to scope neglect, decision-makers are prone to
treat existential risks in a similar way to problems which are less
severe by many orders of magnitude.]{.underline} A wide range of other
cognitive biases are likely to affect the evaluation of existential
risks.75

### Consequentialism Good

#### Refusing to assume responsibility for the consequences of their \[ontological/epistemological/whatever\] starting point enables political [disaster]{.underline}---their args about ontological entanglement with the rest of the world [prove this]{.underline}

**Zanotti 17**

Associate Professor Department of Political Science, Virginia Tech
(Laura, "Reorienting IR: Ontological Entanglement, Agency, and Ethics,"
International Studies Review, January 13, 2017

In this article, I have argued that in order for IR to remain
politically relevant and critical, we must rethink and reflect on the
ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions of the
discipline. I then explored how [onto-epistemologies, ethics, and
political agency are **interlinked**]{.underline}. Ontologies of
entanglement tend to embrace complex conceptualizations of causality and
the morphogenetic properties of what exist. In a quantum world,
ontological cuts happen in practices. [This]{.underline} worldview
[invites a **reconsideration** of the way we **justify**]{.underline}
and address [**political decisions** and **ethical action** beyond the
**universalism** supported by atomistic ontologies and the **stifling
limits** imposed by substantialist-structuralism]{.underline}. As Nick
Onuf has argued, "In a straightened world, as [in a world in turmoil,
talk of universal principles **rings hollow**]{.underline}... [In such a
world, positional ethics is the **best we can hope for**]{.underline}"
(Onuf forthcoming, quoted with permission). [A quantum
reconceptualization of our being in the world and our relation to matter
calls for a **profound sense of modesty**, as well as for the **central
role of responsibility** for taking political decisions. In an entangled
world that is **not governed** by **theoretically detectable**,
**linear**, and **immutable laws** of history, but instead by
**intra-agential processes**, the conditions of possibility for
political agency are rooted in]{.underline} the morphogenetic properties
of **[practices]{.underline}**. Taking responsibility for critically
questioning what exists without the hubris of assuming our ability to
ordain outcomes displays an affinity with Foucault's methodological and
political project. In this vein, [ethical guidelines **may not be
grounded on abstractions** stemming from the solitary ruminations of an
individual's mind]{.underline}. [Prudence, responsibility]{.underline},
and practices of cultivation of the self [offer pathways to **overcome
the limitations** of]{.underline} the Kantian categorical imperative by
which **[universal prescriptions]{.underline}** are the main way of
validating ethical choices. As Patomäki has shown, [universalism may
elicit **exclusionary** and **violent practices**]{.underline}.
Moreover, as Connolly has argued, [the nostalgia for a slowly moving
world regulated by **linear relations of causality** and characterized
by **certainty** and **stability** may be the **root of
fundamentalism**.]{.underline} Furthermore, [if we accept]{.underline}
Barad's position [that we are "**of the world**" and not **above the
world**, theorizing looks more like a practice endowed with
**performative political effects** than a **quest** for the discovery of
the "**true nature**" of what exists]{.underline}. Therefore,
[intellectual undertakings are a **form of political agency** and come
with **great responsibility**. Such responsibility **requires** the need
for **exercising prudence** in making truth statements about what is
**universally good** or **naturally inevitable**. Assumptions
about]{.underline} linearity of causal relations,
**[universal]{.underline}** laws of history, or **[ontological
properties]{.underline}** of entities [yield]{.underline} two
[**problematic effects**. On the one hand, they may **stifle political
imagination**; on the other hand, they could encourage actions based
upon **abstract prescriptions** rather than upon **careful diagnosis**
of the forces that obtain in the situation at hand. In an entangled
world, **there are no externalities**. Arguments that **divert
responsibility** by basing political choices upon **abstract
principles** or **aspirations** and]{.underline}, as a result, [that
treat **what happens on the ground** as "**unintended consequences**" or
"**collateral damage**," are **ethically thin** and **politically
dangerous**.]{.underline} In fact, [**unintended consequences** may well
be the result of **irresponsible political decision-making** that does
not include a **competent assessment** of the **practical
configurations** that constitute the **context of action** and the
**means necessary** to achieve stated goals. Such
attitudes]{.underline}, Amoureux and Steele (2014) have suggested, [have
led to **disastrous initiatives**, such as the **Bush administration's
invasion of Iraq**]{.underline}. Likewise, Kennedy (2006) has shown that
[the]{.underline} bland [rhetoric]{.underline} of jus in bello that
provides standardized criteria regarding the number of acceptable
civilian casualties (conveniently called collateral damage) [produces
the effect of **diverting responsibility** from those who conduct war
while **assuaging their consciences** concerning the injuries and deaths
their choices are inflicting]{.underline}. Kennedy (2004) has also shown
that [as a result of the preference for **universal normativity**,
the]{.underline} human rights [profession]{.underline} (which he calls
"the invisible college") [is more concerned with **protecting abstract
norms** than with **acting politically** so as to **devise viable
solutions** to **specific problems**.]{.underline} Universal norms and
bureaucratic routines play a major role in prescribing and justifying UN
peacekeeping interventions. As Jean Marie Guehénno argued more than a
decade ago, strategies of international intervention based upon
assumptions of causal linearity and invariance may amount to hubris.
Norms and rules can also offer grounds for appeasement. The massacres
that occurred in Rwanda and Srebrenica in the 1990s provide examples of
how, by uncritically following institutionalized rules, United Nations
peacekeepers permitted atrocities. UN employees are not cold-blooded
monsters or extremely callous individuals. They follow norms and rules,
key examples of which include the principle of "impartiality," Security
Council mandates, and "rules of engagement." By doing so, however, they
have often fallen short of considering the possible consequences of
decisions in specific situations. The United Nations' failure to take
action to prevent the Rwanda and Srebrenica genocide testifies to the
fact that following universal norms (i.e., the imperative to preserve
impartiality) and bureaucratic reasoning (i.e., the rules of engagement
prescribing not to intervene to disarm any party of the conflict) set
the stage for avoiding a careful assessment of what was at stake on the
eve of the massacres. These ways of reasoning also appeased consciences
for not making decisions accountable to the people in danger (Zanotti
2014). Significantly, [the **lack of prudence** that derives from
**broad overgeneralizations** and **reliance on abstractions**,
**rather** than **careful consideration** of **what the case demands**,
threatens **more self-defeating outcomes** in peacekeeping and
international politics. This is why a **careful reflection** of the ways
our political choices are **validated ontologically** and
**epistemologically** is of **paramount practical
importance**]{.underline}. Seven decades ago, Carr (1946) advocated the
need for conceptualizing political agency and ethics in a way that
addresses both the limits of the idealist illusion regarding the
possibility to transform reality through acts of will as well as the
realist persuasion about the inescapable subordination of actors to
external conditions. Both of [these positions]{.underline}, Carr pointed
out, [lead to **self-defeating outcomes** and **stifle political
imagination** because they **focus on general abstractions**,
**failing** to take into consideration what conditions and political
opportunity **actually obtain** in **specific historical
configurations**]{.underline}. Here I have proposed that [an ontology of
entanglement fosters an **ethic of engagement** and
**activism**]{.underline} along the lines suggested by Foucault and
opens up possibilities for political action. In this ontological
horizon, [what qualifies as meaningful agency is **not stifled**
by]{.underline} the structuralist commitment to the stabilizing effects
of structures (like in Waltz's) or by [the **inescapable features** of
an **oppressive** and **alienating social order** that **dispossess
subjects of their humanity** and **reduces them to "bare
life"**]{.underline} (as in Agamben). Instead, [micropolitical
interventions]{.underline}, parrēsia, and the cultivation of a
particular kind of character, [**while not revolutionizing the status
quo**, may be relevant to **triggering social change**]{.underline}.
Importantly, [ontologies of entanglement also **raise the bar** for
**adjudicating** the **ethical validity of political choices**. Radical
assumption of responsibility **drastically limits what is acceptable**
as "**unintended consequences**." This is **important** for]{.underline}
the way international organizations make decisions regarding
international peacekeeping interventions and for [**the way politicians
decide to wage war**. **Ethically** and **politically sound**
decision-making **cannot** be based mainly upon]{.underline} the
apodictic recognition of universal rules of behavior, [**abstract
aspirations**, or **overarching theories** of the functioning of
society. They must also include **careful analysis** of how]{.underline}
clusters of [causes may **generate effects** in the **specific
contexts** at hand and **take responsibility** for]{.underline} the
ontological cuts [our initiatives]{.underline} operate [and for
the]{.underline} morphogenetic [processes they may set off.]{.underline}

### NATO Good -- Gendermen

#### No link---NATO's WPS agenda has disrupted gender hierarchies

[And yet, engaging in gender work can offer opportunities for a more
'genderconscious' masculinity to develop]{.underline} (Hurley, 2018a).
In Chapter 1, we highlight how change in institutions of hegemonic
masculinity is, at least theoretically, possible[. In her discussion of
change in hegemonic masculinity, Duncanson (2013, 2015) highlights the
dangers of dismissing any form of positive change in the way men
construct, understand and enact their masculinities as simply the
'flexibility of the machinery of rule' (Duncanson, 2015: 232). Positive
change is not always co-option, and as Connell and Messerschmidt (2005:
840) argue, the concept of hegemonic masculinity was never meant to mean
a 'toxic assemblage' of negative traits: though, as we have discussed,
co-option and hybridisation can be ways in which particular forms of
masculinity retain their hegemonic status]{.underline} (Messner, 2007;
Demetriou, 2001). Duncanson argues that positive change and the
'unravelling of hegemonic masculinity' is possible and that it must
begin with men being encouraged: not so much to change their ways as to
change the way in which they negotiate their identities in relation to
others. [Rather than forge their identities through relations of
opposition or domination, men and subjects in general need to construct
their identities through recognition of similarity, respect,
interdependence, empathy and equality with others.]{.underline}
(Duncanson 2015: 233, emphasis in original) [There was evidence of this
(re)negotiation in the accounts of NATO's gendermen. Those with whom we
spoke to articulated a great deal of respect for their
colleagues]{.underline}. Witnessing the mutual admiration and respect
the men and women of the Executive Committee of the NCGP had for each
other whilst working together to advance gender issues within NATO was
further testament to this. [Yet, doing gender work and putting on your
gender glasses (a point returned to in Chapter 5) also afforded an
opportunity to increase mutual respect between men and women both inside
and outside of NATO:]{.underline} In the armed forces as well as in
civil society, it is not just a matter of having the same salaries,
having the same access to work; it is having the same mentality. Once
you get this mentality, especially in men, seeing life with your gender
glasses, I think the lives of many people will change ... you apply the
gender glasses to everything and your level of respect for the other
gender is much better. Interview with NATO Official, 2012 in Hurley
(2018) [In addition to the fostering of respect, there was also a sense
of empathy, both for women within NATO and those external to it, those
affected by war and conflict that was articulated:96 NATO women and
gendermen]{.underline} We try to find believers \[in gender\] and you
find believers everywhere, they don't need to be women, most of them are
women. I can tell you, unfortunately, because I feel really alone in
this world. I feel the same as when women joined the armed forces and
they were just one or two and it is really hard, I can tell you, it is
really hard. You have to behave because they are watching you ... they
are watching you, they are paying attention to what you do because you
are, let's say an alien in their world. You have to introduce this
issue, but in a serious way. You have to explain to them basic gender
concepts, very basic gender concepts, but you have to go deeper. It is
not just: 'What is gender mainstreaming?', 'What are gender
perspectives?' It is more. It applies to people suffering the effects of
wars and operations. You have to listen to them, understand how they
feel, how the operations affect them and in which ways; ask how you can
help them. Interview with NATO Official, 2012 in Hurley (2018) [As
highlighted above, gendermen are in a distinct position within NATO,
they find themselves in a minority position vis-à-vis women when working
on gender. Doing this work makes men highly visible and this brings with
it feelings of being out of place; this can prompt a form of empathy
with women who occupy a minority position vis-à-vis men within NATO writ
large (Hurley, 2018a).]{.underline}

### NATO Good -- Gender Advisors

#### NATO's WPS agenda proves state action can be good---Gender Advisors materially improve the lives of marginalized people globally

[NATO's own external presentation of the work of its Gender Advisors is
largely extremely positive.52]{.underline} The most comprehensive
reviews of their work have been upbeat overall. Egnell, Hojem, and
Berts' presented Gender Advisors' as having 'made a gender perspective a
real and permanent feature of Swedish contributions to international
operations'53 We asked Gender Advisors what they felt had been their key
successes. Their responses are scrutinized in two directions: first,
internal: in terms of changing mindsets within their military structures
as regards women and the relevance of gender (an aspect of regendering,
discussed above) and changing their colleagues' working practices;
second, external: in terms of impacts upon communities -- improving
security for women and men, and increasing women's participation.
Changes in Military Practice and Mindsets [Overwhelmingly, Gender
Advisors tended to describe their success in terms of
'institutionalization' and 'integration' of procedures to include gender
perspectives. The Gender Advisors generally conveyed a sense of slow but
steady progress in acceptance of the relevance of gender to militaries,
and processes to facilitate consideration of it in military
operations]{.underline}. Lackenbauer and Langlais' 2013 review had found
that ISAF Gender Advisors had little structure for their work, having to
decide on their own focus and tasks. The more recently deployed Gender
Advisors we interviewed described established processes for Gender
Advisors' engagement in planning, identification of goals and
indicators; more access to command; and fuller staffing of Gender
Advisor posts. Those who been involved in the Resolute Support Mission
in Afghanistan, which commenced in January 2015, described gender as
integrated in the Mission's indicators and reporting mechanisms;
operational plans and standard operating procedures; facilities,
activities, budgets; and focusing not only upon women but upon
influencing men. [Some Gender Advisors describe a key mark of progress
as the recognition by the command that integrating gender perspective is
their responsibility, advised and supported by their Gender Advisor,
rather than the responsibility of the Gender Advisor]{.underline}. When
it started in 2008 ... they put a lot of responsibility on the Gender
Field Advisor. And then it was very easy to criticise the work because
it's very difficult to be successful if you're, like, alone and ... no
one really knows what is this about ... now the organisation has a full
understanding and acceptance of this, and that is that the work of
integrating a gender perspective should always be the Commander's ... So
absolutely, absolutely it has evolved. (Agnes) Another ISAF Gender
Advisor recounted being in a senior staff meeting in which the commander
asked who was going to a conference organized by Afghan women. When eyes
slid to the Gender Advisor, the commander said, 'I am on board. We will
push this button. And if I do it, you have to do it too' (meaning they
all had to go to the conference). Although describing gender as a
'button' raises questions, the Gender Advisor interpreted this as the
commander reiterating the importance for all parts of the Mission of
engaging with Afghan women. [As evidence of institutionalization through
the headquarters or operation, a number of Gender Advisors described
colleagues independently including gender in planning documents or
analyses]{.underline}. Many highlighted changing their colleagues'
mindset as regard the relevance of gender. Security and Women's
Empowerment [A number of Gender Advisors gave examples of how their
advice had been used to mitigate the harm that NATO's own activities
might pose to women. Some mentioned using a gender perspective in
analysing intelligence so as to mitigate 'collateral damage' in NATO
targeting]{.underline}. One described broadening consultation with local
communities to include women, so to understand what roads they used, to
be able to avoid them. One spoke of 'prevent\[ing\] an American General
killing some women' by advising on how funding might be provided to
community projects without inflaming local rivalries. [Gender Advisors,
however, most often described their successes as hoped-for impacts of
their individual contacts with local women: having facilitated their
coming together, inspiring them to join the security forces, motivating
them.]{.underline} The first thing I wrote was a zero ... \[but\] I met
Afghan women and would see them six months later with burkhas off,
talking to soldiers, trying to negotiate for funds ... maybe a little
drop that fills up the bucket, for me, that is enough. (Workshop
participant) I hope that I have motivated one woman to not give up and
keep fighting for women's rights. (Workshop participant) [A number of
Gender Advisors had worked to support Afghan security forces in
integrating women, and felt that their advocacy with the Afghan
authorities to emphasize the importance of women's participation had
been successful. One talked about directly supporting female police
through helping them to set up their own network; another about Gender
Advisors' support to centres and protection units dealing with gender
based violence. Others talked about being role models for Afghan women
to join the security forces]{.underline}. We noticed that, although the
description of a Gender Advisor's role in Bi-Strategic Directive 40-1
refers to gender analysis and collection of data, none identified
progress by reference to measured changes in, for example, prevalence of
acts of violence or community perceptions of security.54 [They did not
claim systematic positive impacts upon the lives of communities affected
by conflict or by NATO operations; rather small wins and hopeful
signals.]{.underline}

### NATO Good -- A2 Imperialism

#### NATO's engagement is not unidirectional imperialism, but a collaborative process with members and allies---UNSCR 1325 proves

UNSCR 1325 has proven a useful diplomatic tool for NATO's EAPC partners
to further their engagement and influence at NATO, incommensurate with
status. [The role of partner states in NATO's adoption of UNSCR 1325 has
challenged assumptions that NATO partnerships are (solely) a means
through which NATO can influence the aspirations of non-members by
setting the parameters of the relationship. This challenges assumptions
that NATO partnerships are (solely) outward-facing and that NATO sets
the parameters of the relationship]{.underline} (Holmberg, 2011: 534;
Webber, Hallams and Smith, 2014: 776; Simón, 2014: 18; Wallander, 2000:
729). For example, the NATO/EAPC Policy calls for NATO partners to be
involved in the development of the Military Concept (what would become
Bi-Strategic Command Directive 40--1), 'to the maximum possible extent'
given 'their important contributions of Partner nations to NATO-led
operations' (NATO, 2007). [This has demonstrated that norm sharing can
be a multi-directional process with NATO partners having had a
significant role in putting UNSCR 1325 onto NATO's agenda and in
continuing to support it. This challenges understandings of NATO
partnerships as unidirectional, both as a means through which NATO can
influence the aspirations of non-members by setting the parameters of
the relationship]{.underline} (Wallander, 2000: 729) and as a
'functional tool for burden sharing' (Hallams, 2013: 119). This is
significant given the widening and broadening of NATO partnerships,
including into Asia and the Middle East, necessitates a reassessment of
the value of partnerships (for NATO and partners), even if NATO has yet
to fully resolve the purpose of partnerships (Moore, 2012: 57). As this
chapter goes onto discuss, the broadening of the actors involved within
NATO's engagement with WPS has strengthened both the latest iterations
of the NATO/EAPC Policy on UNSCR 1325 applicable to the civilian
structure and the accompanying military Bi-Strategic Command Directive
40--1. The actors involved include, but are not limited to, NATO
Officials, member states, partner states, civil society, NATO Special
Representative on WPS, IMS Office of the Gender Advisor, NATO Committee
on Gender Perspectives and most recently Angelina Jolie. [The alliance's
engagement with WPS has created new gender policy machinery in the form
of the NATO Special Representative and the recreation of the IMS Office
of the Gender Advisor and NCGP]{.underline}. It has also garnered
attention from external actors who were not present and did not
contribute to NATO's initial engagement with WPS (civil society,
Angelina Jolie). So, while the role of NATO partners, namely Austria and
Sweden, and the Friends of 1325, was crucial in putting WPS onto NATO's
agenda, we need to consider if these new actors have influenced the
ideas and practices underpinning WPS at NATO.

### Liberalism Good

#### The perm is best \-\-- the alt fails alone but combining strategies provides meaningful routes for change 

**Paris, 10** -- (Roland, Associate Professor, Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs, University of Ottawa, "Saving Liberal
Peacebuilding," February 17, 2010,
<http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~rparis/Saving_Liberal_Peacebuilding_FINAL.pdf>)
// kt \*\*modified for ableist language

**[If there is no realistic or preferable alternative to broadly liberal
approaches, what can be done in the face of the current "crisis" of
liberal peacebuilding]{.underline}**? The first step is to question the
extent to which this crisis is real or imagined. In this article, I have
attempted to show that some of the most sweeping [critiques of liberal
peacebuilding have rested on dubious claims and logic]{.underline},
[including the conflation of post-conquest and post-settlement
peacebuilding; unnuanced analogies of peacebuilding and colonialism or
imperialism; definitions of the liberal peace that are too broad;
mischaracterizations of the peacebuilding record; and
oversimplifications of the moral complexity of
peacebuilding]{.underline}. Considered in this light, [**the purported
crisis of liberal peacebuilding appears to be less severe and less
fundamental than some have claimed.** The challenge today is not to
replace or move "beyond" liberal peacebuilding, but to reform existing
approaches within a broadly liberal framework]{.underline}. **[This
enterprise has both conceptual and policy elements]{.underline}**.
**[Peacebuilding remains ripe for theoretical treatments that shed light
on the meaning and effects of these operations]{.underline}**. In other
words, [the peacebuilding literature need not, and should not, be
limited to narrowly policy-oriented]{.underline} or "problem solving"
[analyses]{.underline}. In the 1990s, most of the peacebuilding
literature was preoccupied with practical policy issues and paid little
attention to the relationships between peacebuilding and larger
phenomena in international politics. The rise of more [critical
analysis]{.underline} since then has been part of a welcome broadening
of the field, which now [places greater emphasis on exploring the
theoretical underpinnings and implications of these
missions]{.underline}. The great strength of critical approaches has
always been their focus on exposing and dissecting widely held
assumptions and orthodoxies. But **[critical scholarship can lose its
intellectual and empirical moorings if it fails to be self-reflective
and self-critical --]{.underline}** that is, [if its logic, evidence and
implications are not themselves subject to scrutiny and
challenge]{.underline}. **[Nothing in the recent critical literature
offers a convincing rationale for abandoning liberal peacebuilding,
rather than reforming it]{.underline}**. If anything, the rise of what I
have called [hyper-critical scholarship]{.underline} -- and particularly
its dubious yet seemingly ritualized rejection of liberal peacebuilding
-- [has served to cloud rather than clarify our understanding of what
peacebuilding is, and what it does.]{.underline} 38 Of course, there is
no single "best" way of analyzing these missions or the broader
phenomenon of international peacebuilding. [This field of research is --
and hopefully will remain -- a diverse bazaar of different theoretical
and empirical approaches, open to discussion and debate across
intellectual traditions and methodologies]{.underline}. This article has
sought to contribute to this debate by arguing for a rethinking and
rebalancing of liberal peacebuilding critiques. In contrast to the
unconvincing hyper-criticism of today, or the irrational exuberance of
earlier [years, a more constructively critical approach might build on
the recognition that: (1) both liberalism and liberal peacebuilding are
deeply problematic concepts]{.underline} -- in theory and application --
[and their internal contradictions play themselves out in peacebuilding,
sometimes in troubling and destructive ways; (2) liberally-oriented
peacebuilding can,]{.underline} in principle, [accommodate]{.underline}
a great deal of internal [variation and adjustment,
**including**]{.underline} many of **[the specific changes proposed
by]{.underline}** many [**critics**; (3) scholars who]{.underline}
repudiate liberal peacebuilding or [call for "alternative" strategies
should be **expected to reflect carefully on the normative
underpinnings** of their own arguments, and to **clarify the
alternatives they may be proposing**, including the moral and practical
implications of pursuing these alternatives]{.underline}. The third
point should be particularly important for those who believe that
critical peacebuilding scholarship has an important contribution to make
to the field -- and that the recent turn towards a reflexive
anti-liberalism has diminished the force of these critiques. **[Adopting
a constructively critical orientation does not mean accepting the
current practices of peacebuilding.]{.underline}** **[It does not mean
that peacebuilding must be "top-down" instead of
"bottom-up"]{.underline}** -- that is a criticism of centralism, not
liberalism. **[It does not mean that peacebuilding should be fixated on
formal institutions to the exclusion of informal or customary methods of
governance]{.underline}** -- that is a criticism of formalism, not
liberalism. It [does not mean that peacebuilders should adopt a "fixed,
non-negotiable concept of what the state should eventually
look]{.underline} [like]{.underline}"117 -- that is a criticism of
institutional isomorphism, not liberalism. [Nor does it mean that
peacebuilders should assume that liberalization will necessarily foster
peace]{.underline} -- that is a criticism of naïve Wilsonianism, one
variant of liberalism.118 **[Addressing all of these real problems may
entail probing the internal tensions of liberalism, but it does not
require a sweeping rejection of liberal peacebuilding.]{.underline}** In
fact, [there are many recent examples of constructively critical
research that raise important theoretical and practical questions, some
of which challenge liberal premises without making the mistake of
discarding the baby with the bathwater]{.underline}. [For
instance:]{.underline} [What are the sources and dynamics of
"legitimacy" in international peacebuilding]{.underline}?119 What
obligations, if any, do international actors have in rebuilding
societies after conflict?120 What are the limits of external democracy
promotion efforts?121 [How might "non-elite" populations of host states
be included more directly into peace negotiations and post-conflict
institutional reform]{.underline}?122 What is the relationship between
power-sharing arrangements and peace?123 [How might ideas of "local
ownership" be developed in a manner that avoids simplistic bromides
about the need for greater local ownership or
emancipation?]{.underline}124 Other examples include: [How do
"discursive frames" and organizational procedures shape the design and
conduct of peacebuilding in practice]{.underline}?125 How can
peacebuilding agencies learn from experiences across missions without
falling into the trap of assuming that "technical" knowledge is readily
transferrable across diverse local circumstances?126 Why does the UN
seem to make peacebuilding commitments that it subsequently fails to
fulfill in practice?127 [What are the economic impacts of
peacebuilding]{.underline} operations?128 What is the relationship
between "peace conditionalities" in economic assistance and the
durability of the ensuing peace?129 How can economic liberalization be
pursued in ways that minimize the dangers of strengthening black
markets?130 Under what circumstances should peacebuilding missions end,
and how should they "exit"?131 This is just a small sampling of research
questions that represent a broad mix of normative approaches. They point
to even larger unresolved questions, including the crucial issue of how
one should define peacebuilding "success."132 Many of these research
efforts also offer the possibility of making peacebuilding operations
more effective, and more just, in the future. Whichever research paths
one may chose to follow, those engaged in constructively critical
analysis have an immense task ahead of them: peacebuilding is
tremendously complex and prone to unanticipated consequences, yet it is
also too important to lose or abandon. [As long as both scholars and
practitioners embrace an open, critical discussion]{.underline} of
peacebuilding's merits and flaws, [without descending into unwarranted
hyper-criticism]{.underline}, [there is still hope of
improving]{.underline} both the conception and delivery of
[international]{.underline} assistance to [societies]{.underline}
embarking on difficult transitions from war to peace.

#### Liberalism is inevitable and a transition would cause escalating conflict -- the alt excludes the aff but the aff doesn't exclude the alt 

**Paris, 10** -- (Roland, Associate Professor, Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs, University of Ottawa, "Saving Liberal
Peacebuilding," February 17, 2010,
<http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~rparis/Saving_Liberal_Peacebuilding_FINAL.pdf>)
// kt \*\*modified for ableist language

In fact, **[there seems to be no viable alternative to some version of
liberal peacebuilding.]{.underline}** Consider, [first, the question of
whether international peacebuilding should be continued at
all.]{.underline} As we saw, some commentators including Jeffrey Herbst
and Jeremy Weinstein have suggested that conflicts should sometimes be
allowed to burn themselves out, and that large-scale "impartial"
intervention (even after a ceasefire agreement) risks locking in
conditions that are not sustainable or compatible with long-term peace.
There is some logic to this approach, since wars ending in military
victory may produce longer-lasting peace than those ending in negotiated
settlements. But [this strategy could also involve huge risks and costs:
The victors might decimate the losers, or alternatively some wars might
grind on for years or decades without resolution, all the while
producing humanitarian crises before one side finally achieves
victory.]{.underline} In the meantime, [conflicts could spread to
neighbouring territories]{.underline}, as several have done in Africa in
recent years. On balance, then, **[failing to provide assistance when it
is possible to do so, and when it is requested by local parties, would
seem a short-sighted and dangerous solution to the shortcomings of these
operations;]{.underline}** **[just as suspending the practice of
post-conflict peacebuilding would be a significant overreaction to the
various problems that these missions have experienced and
caused.]{.underline}** Nor is there any sign of declining demand for new
operations, given the increased trend for civil conflicts to end in
negotiated settlements in recent years.97 But [why, in this case, must
peacebuilding be liberal]{.underline}? **[The simple answer is that
alternative strategies -- that is, strategies not rooted in liberal
principles -- would likely create more problems than they would
solve]{.underline}**. One approach, for example, might be for
international agencies to establish permanent trusteeships over war-torn
states -- that is, externally run governments that have no intention of
ceding their authority to local actors. This option is not unlike the
formula proposed by Stephen Krasner, who called for direct international
governance of dangerously fragile states "for an indefinite period of
time."98 The main problem with this approach is that it would come very
close to colonial-type control -- indeed, much more so than even the
most longlasting and interventionist post-settlement missions that have
been conducted to date. Maintaining such an arrangement over the long
term would likely require permanent suppression of domestic political
activity within the host state. As David Edelstein points out, even when
foreign military deployments are made at the invitation of local
parties, they face a problem of an "obsolescing welcome" whereby
elements of the local population tend to grow increasingly resentful of
a powerful external presence in their society.99 Continuing to embrace
the objective of transferring full sovereign powers to local actors may
thus be the single most important strategy for addressing this problem
and for widening the "window" of time available for peacebuilders to
assist in strengthening domestic institutions within the host state. By
contrast, establishing permanent foreign rule would reduce the time
available for peacebuilders to do their work before local resentment
begins to build and the peacebuilding mission becomes an obstacle to,
rather than a facilitator of, consolidating a stable peace. A second
alternative to liberal peacebuilding might be for international agencies
to identify local leaders who could rule as undemocratic strongmen over
their society. This would, at least, provide a means for peacebuilders
to scale back their presence quickly, as long as they continued to offer
various types of support (financial, material, etc.) to the ruling
person or party. Indeed, this was roughly that strategy that the United
States and Soviet Union pursued with their respective patrons in many
parts of the world during the Cold War. However, one of the practical
problems with this approach is that authoritarian regimes created and
sustained by external parties have often turned out to be more fragile
than they appear, in part because they tend to lack domestic legitimacy
and therefore remain in power only by repressing or buying off their
internal rivals. This was one of the lessons learned at the end of the
Cold War, when a reduction or cessation of immense flows of superpower
assistance led to the collapse of authoritarian regimes in Somalia,
Zaire/Congo and elsewhere, followed by a violent scramble for power.
Furthermore, in a country just emerging from civil war, where two or
more factions were engaged in large-scale killing, a postconflict
"strongman strategy" would risk alienating unrepresented groups that
might choose to resume violence rather than living under the new regime.
Some measure of power-sharing, or at least a reasonable prospect of
gaining power through an unrigged political process, generally helps to
mitigate this danger.100 A third **[alternative to liberal peacebuilding
might be to rely on traditional or indigenous practices of peace-making
and governance, rather than elections and other accoutrements of liberal
democracy.]{.underline}** Roger Mac Guinty has usefully highlighted the
limited space provided for such approaches in existing peacebuilding
models, which tend to be "highly standardized" and rooted in a sense of
the "superiority of Western approaches to peace-making."101 In contrast
to the more formalistic and legalistic approaches, traditional and
indigenous methods tend to focus on "consensus decision-making, a
restoration of the human/resource balance, and compensation or gift
exchange designed to ensure reciprocal and ongoing harmonious relations
between groups."102 Because they reflect local customs, he adds, these
techniques may "hold the potential to achieve a grass-roots legitimacy
that may be lacking from more technocratic 'alien' forms of dispute
resolution that form the mainstay of Western-funded and designed
peacesupport programs and projects."103 [While]{.underline} [Mac Guinty
makes a strong case for adapting policies to local conditions and
traditions]{.underline} (using examples such as Afghanistan's Loya
Jirgas, or tribal [assemblies, which played an important role in that
country's initial transition from Taliban rule), he does not recommend
relying exclusively on such techniques]{.underline}. On the contrary, he
wisely warns of **[the danger of romanticizing traditional or indigenous
practices]{.underline}** -- not least **[because they may serve to
reinforce "the authority of existing power-holders" and to impose
"social conformity," sometimes in brutal ways]{.underline}**.104 Tanja
[Chopra's analysis of local peacebuilding initiatives in Kenya offers
cautionary tale illustrating these dangers]{.underline}. Efforts to tap
into traditional conflict-resolution techniques through community-level
"peace committees" in Keyna have shown some success, but in some cases
they have also served to "deepen existing rifts between communities" and
"reinforce divisions" while also undermining concurrent efforts to
strengthen respect for the rule of law at the national level.105
**[Traditional and bottom-up approaches,]{.underline}** in other
words**[, should be part of peacebuilding, but they are no
panacea.]{.underline}** There are other reasons to be cautious before
embracing traditional governance methods. Those who believe that doing
so will eliminate or reduce the intrusion of foreign peacebuilders in
the domestic affairs of the host state fail to recognize that
peacebuilders will still need to make crucial choices, whether they wish
to do so or not. [**No society has a single, unambiguous set of
governance structures (traditional or otherwise) that can be
automatically activated.** Consequential decisions must therefore be
made to privilege some structures and not others -- and, as much as
peacebuilders might view themselves as referees in such decisions, in
fact they will always be "players" simply by virtue of their relative
power in the domestic setting of a wartorn state]{.underline}.106 In any
event, **[some measure of external influence may be necessary and
desirable:]{.underline}** if the post-conflict society could organize
its own governance arrangements without international assistance, there
would have been no need or demand for peacebuilding in the first place.
Given all this, consider the implications [if international agencies
were to adopt a general policy of relying on indigenous governance
structures in post-conflict countries]{.underline}. Very likely, [any
political outcomes]{.underline} of this process [would be questioned and
contested due to perceived international "interference,"]{.underline}
[no matter how well-meaning and diligent the peacebuilders were in
seeking to remain neutral]{.underline}. Further, in cases where one
individual or group dominated such a process, the result could be the
equivalent of the second alternative to liberal peacebuilding discussed
above -- strongman rule -- with all the problems associated with that
option. These are all real concerns that counsel caution, but in spite
of the risks and complexities, experience in Afghanistan, Cambodia and
elsewhere suggests that much more research attention needs to be devoted
to the topic of hybrid arrangements in countries recovering from
conflict, or approaches those that blend formal, informal, modern and
customary methods of governance and conflict resolution.107 It is also
interesting that Mac Guinty argues that one of the benefits of customary
arrangements could be to enhance "political participation," while he
also warns against the dangers of authoritarianism. Such arguments
suggest that Mac Guinty, like other commentators discussed above, is
less concerned with the liberal orientation of current peacebuilding
approaches than he is with their relative rigidity and lack of
adaptability to local conditions. In fact, [**there is nothing in the
idea of the "liberal peace" or "liberal peacebuilding" that mandates
such inflexibility.** Liberal polities come in many different styles and
forms, from group-based "consociational" proportional representation
arrangements to Anglo-American-style plurality systems, and there is
nothing to prevent liberalism from accommodating new models**. Nor does
support for liberal political principles stand in the way of pursuing
any number of complementary initiatives and goals**]{.underline},
[including those focusing on]{.underline} post-conflict
[reconciliation]{.underline},108 [social welfare and
justice]{.underline},109 [extensive public deliberations]{.underline} at
the national and local levels,110 [or the empowerment and inclusion of
women and other marginalized groups]{.underline}.111 The **[key
principles of liberalism -- individual freedoms, representative
government, and constitutional limits on arbitrary power -- offer a
broader canvas for institutional design and creative policymaking.
Without clear alternatives, some version of liberalism therefore remains
the most sensible foundation for post-conflict
peacebuilding]{.underline}**. [The overarching goal of such missions
should be to create the conditions for representative self-government,
not only because such an outcome is the least morally objectionable goal
for peacebuilding, but also for the practical purpose of facilitating
the eventual departure of peacebuilders through the restoration of
domestic sovereignty over the territory.]{.underline} Further, while the
importance of [elections]{.underline} alone should not be exaggerated,
they [remain a crucial tool for populations to constitute their own
governments, not only during the period of peacebuilding, but on an
ongoing basis]{.underline}.112 While it is true that encouraging
elections itself involves an external intrusion in the internal affairs
of the host state, surely we can differentiate between more and less
acceptable intrusions -- including the fact that [elections are meant to
facilitate the society's ability to shape its own destiny and exercise
self-government,]{.underline} so that the peacebuilders themselves can
leave. Elections alone cannot achieve this goal, nor do elections equal
democracy. But of all the possible ways in which international actors
can influence the domestic politics of a country, the idea of promoting
self-government is one of the least morally objectionable -- and, from
the standpoint of not overstaying an "obsolescing welcome," it may be a
pragmatic necessity. Similarly, [while certain economic liberalization
strategies can be destabilizing]{.underline},113 [is there really an
alternative to some version of market-oriented reform]{.underline} in
states emerging from war? The second half of the twentieth century
demonstrated that centrally planned and state-dominated development
strategies -- including not only Soviet-style communism but also import
substitution strategies pursued in many parts of Latin America and
Africa -- generally produced lower levels of economic growth than
market-oriented development strategies. Debates continue about the
appropriate balance between the market and the state in economic
development, including greater regulation of financial institutions and
the like, but there is near-universal agreement today that
non-market-oriented economic policies (or those that do not give the
market a primary role in allocating scarce resources) are too
inefficient to generate sustained economic growth. Most of those who
have criticized the economic dimensions of liberal peacebuilding
(including this author) have called for less aggressive adjustment
strategies in order to reduce the destabilizing effects of rapid
marketization, but have not rejected the idea of economic liberalization
itself -- in part because economic growth is important to the long-term
success of peacebuilding.114 **[Although there is no guarantee that
states pursuing market-oriented development policies will become richer,
there is a near guarantee that those pursuing nonmarket-oriented
strategies will stay poor.]{.underline}** There is no
universally-applicable, market-oriented model appropriate for all
peacebuilding cases. Rather, [there are countless variations of liberal
economic policies that can be explored and pursued]{.underline},115 [but
all share]{.underline} one thing in common: [a primary orientation
toward markets as a foundation for long-term growth.]{.underline} If
existing economic policies have been ill-suited to the needs of war-torn
states, it is not because these policies have been "liberal" or
market-oriented in the broad sense of these terms, but rather, because
they have paid too little attention to the particular vulnerabilities of
countries just emerging from destructive and divisive conflicts,
including the potentially destabilizing effects of "shock therapy"
adjustment policies.116 Addressing such problems primarily involves
altering and customizing, not abandoning, the economically liberal
elements of peacebuilding.

### Policy Good

#### Policy reforms have created meaningful changes to NATO's gender initiatives

Pg 55-58. LJS

Bi-Strategic Command Directive 40--1 (Bi-SCD 40--1) represents NATO's
military structure's engagement with WPS. Here we consider Bi-SCD 40--1
as an integral part of NATO's gender architecture and a key moment in
NATO's initial engagement with UNSCR 1325 and later WPS. It was adopted
in 2009 and has since been revised twice, in 2012 and most recently in
20175 (NATO, 2009, 2012a). [The latest version represents a significant
development in the sophistication of NATO's understanding of WPS and
gender perspectives, it also outlines a clear line of accountability. In
a move away from previous versions, the Commander is clearly identified
as the responsible person for its implementation, with gender advisors
providing support and advice and gender focal points acting as a
facilitators (NATO, 2017b). As Chapter 5 will go onto argue, examining
these policies demonstrates both the changes in NATO's understanding of
the value of a gender perspective, but also the
continuities]{.underline}. Here, we provide an important context for
this discussion and consider the institutional actors responsible for
shaping it. Following the call in the 2007 NATO/EAPC Policy for NATO's
Military Authorities to lead on its implementation, Bi-SCD 40--1 was
adopted in 2009. As we go on to highlight in Chapter 5, the NATO
Strategic Commands -- Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the
Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) -- jointly drafted
Bi-Strategic Command 40--1 'Integrating UNSCR 1325 and Gender
Perspective into the NATO Command Structure', with the aim of providing
'guidance for the integration of Resolutions, Conventions, Protocols and
gender perspective into the planning and conduct of NATO-led operations'
(Colao, 2013: 19). The document is binding on all International Military
Headquarters and any entity under the ACO or ACT chain of command, which
includes partner states. This represents another way in which NATO acts
as a 'teaching machine' (Enloe, 1981; Wright, 2016), with both member
and partner states deployed on NATO operations learning the value
Bi-Strategic Command 40--1 ascribes to the WPS agenda. [Bi-SCD 40--1 is
not military doctrine (doctrines are approved by the nations in the
Military Committee), but rather the core document for implementing a
gender perspective in NATO military operations. Bi-SCD 40--1 integrates
UNSCR 1325 and Related Resolutions as well as a gender perspective in
the NATO Command Structure, including measures for protection during
armed conflict.]{.underline} It is founded upon the three UNSCR 1325
'P's': prevent disproportionate impact on women and children in armed
conflict; protect women and children; and foster the participation of
women in all aspects of operations and levels of command. [The directive
introduces standards of behaviour and concepts inherent in EU and UN
policy]{.underline} (e.g. gender advisors, incorporating gender
perspectives in operational planning development). [The integration of
gender into Allied Joint Doctrine is now the responsibility of the
Gender Advisors at ACO and ACT (NATO ACT, 2015). Bi-SCD 40--1
contributes to standardising operations and establishing common ways of
accomplishing military tasks between different military actors under the
Allied Joint Doctrine version 1 in respect to gender perspectives and
WPS (NATO, 2017a).]{.underline} We return to Bi-SCD in Chapter 5 where
we consider what a 'gender perspective' means for NATO. Institutional
actors: supporting WPS at NATO In 2009, the Committee on Women in NATO
Forces was renamed the NATO Committee on Gender Perspectives (NCGP) and
its remit expanded to provide advice on gender issues, including the
implementation of UNSCRs 1325 and 1820 and future related UNSCRs under
the remit of WPS. We discuss the role of the NCGP in further detail in
the following chapters, including its important role in supporting
NATO's engagement with WPS. Here, our focus turns to the other
institutional actors who have supported UNSCR 1325 at NATO, particularly
in NATO's political structure. This provides important context for
understanding how the NCGP has supported WPS and how NATO's engagement
with gender issues transgresses across the military and political
structures. In 2013, UN Women commissioned a Global Review of 1325 to
mark the 15th anniversary of since the adoption of UNSCR 1325 in 2015.
In the subsequent report, NATO's Secretary General's Special
Representative on WPS was identified as an example of good practice for
the implementation of the agenda because the position was high profile
and reports directly to the Secretary General (Coomaraswamy, 2015). The
Special Representative has since been invited to address the UN Security
Council, and regularly meets with counterparts in the EU, OSCE and AU
and works with civil society on the issues. The position has been held
by two career diplomats Mari Skåre (2012--14) and Marriët Schuurman
(2014--17) and in 2018, Clare Hutchinson, a highly experienced and
accomplished gender advisor, took over the role. The creation of the
role has provided an important cornerstone of NATO's engagement with
WPS, yet it was not a foregone conclusion that it would be created and
considering how NATO came to have such a position is important for
understanding how NATO functions as a gendered institution. The creation
of the post of NATO Secretary General's Special Representative for WPS
was approved at NATO's 2012 Chicago Summit (WIIS, 2012) and marked a
watershed moment in the implementation of UNSCR 1325 at NATO. The move
to appoint an individual to support NATO's implementation of UNSCR 1325
stemmed from the 2007 NATO/EAPC Policy, which called for consideration
to be given to the appointment of a gender advisor at NATO HQ (NATO,
2007). [However, a Special Representative was a far more senior role,
whose position has the potential to support the advancement of the WPS
agenda at NATO. In considering the significance of the appointment of a
Special Representative on WPS it is important to distinguish such a role
from that of a gender advisor. A gender advisor acts as a means through
which to incorporate a gender perspective and in this sense can come to
represent an institution's gender expertise]{.underline}. In operational
situations and organisational departments, a gender advisor can provide
a useful means for incorporating a gender perspective, in particular
where specialised knowledge is required. Nevertheless, at a wider
organisational level, a gender advisor would symbolise an institution's
gender expertise and this would be likely to hinder attempts to
mainstream a gender perspective throughout the organisational structure,
particularly where they lack the seniority to report directly to the top
of the organisational command. For example, the appointment of a gender
advisor within the EU External Action Service has been criticised
because the position does not report directly to the High-Representative
and as such lacks sufficient authority (Guerrina and Wright, 2016). [A
high-level Special Representative on the other hand provides
institutional leadership and is able to hold the organisation account
for the implementation of WPS. This is why NATO's creation of the post
of Secretary General's Special Representative on WPS has been recognised
as an example of best practice for regional organisations.]{.underline}
The Global Review of UNSCR 1325 recommended that regional organisations
follow NATO's best practice and appoint high-level WPS representatives
in order to drive the implementation of the agenda (Coomaraswamy, 2015:
409).

### Reforms Good

#### Legal reforms challenge essentialist notions of gender

**Williams, 13** (Dr. Juliet A., associate professor in the Department
of Gender Studies at UCLA, \"Girls can be anything\...but boys will be
boys: discourses of sex difference in education reform debates,\" Nevada
Law Journal, Vol. 13, 5-17-13,
scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1472&context=nlj)

\*In this context the "gender essentialists" that Williams is talking
about are those who think that masculine behavior is innately tied to
their biological sex. Meaning that she is arguing we need to challenge
notions that boys are and will always be aggressive, etc. She is also
talking about sex stereotyping in the context of promoting single gender
education environments\*

**[Law has an important role to play]{.underline}** in opening up space
[to contest gender essentialism]{.underline}. One way [this may
happen]{.underline} is [through rigorous application of]{.underline} the
still-evolving [anti-stereotyping]{.underline} principle in
constitutional equal protection analysis. The determination of whether a
classification constitutes stereotyping generally has been understood to
pivot on the question of whether an overbroad generalization is at play.
As a result, the judicial account of sex difference has been
characterized as a form of "sexual realism."67 As Katherine Franke
argues, in constitutional jurisprudence, "the wrong of sex
discrimination is premised upon a right of sexual differentiation, that
is, a fundamental belief in the truth of biological sexual
difference."68 From this perspective, ["\[d\]iscrimination occurs when
false or stereotypical differences are mistaken for real
differences]{.underline}."69 More recently, however, legal scholar Cary
Franklin has demonstrated that the anti-stereotyping principle is being
applied even in cases in which a biological sex difference is
recognized. 70 Reflecting on the significance of the 1996 decision U.S.
v. Virginia, in which the Supreme Court [found the male-only admission
policy at a state-supported military college
unconstitutional]{.underline}, Franklin finds growing judicial [support
for the view that "equal protection law should be particularly alert to
the possibility of sex stereotyping in contexts where 'real' differences
are involved, because these are the contexts in which sex
classifications have most often been used to perpetuate sex-based
inequality."71 In other words, the anti-stereotyping principle is now
invoked to engage the question of the social meaning attributed to sex
differences by a classification.]{.underline} In so doing,
[anti-stereotyping analysis thrusts the social construction of
masculinity to the fore, a development that creates critical leverage
for future challenges to essentialist pedagogies in court.]{.underline}
The evidence rallied to support sex segregation must be carefully
reviewed to ensure that sex stereotyping does not take the place of
meaningful education reforms.72 Responding to legal challenges,
proponents of "gender-friendly" educational initiatives portray their
detractors as feminist ideologues unwilling to accept the simple facts
of nature. But rhetorical warfare is no substitute for a fair and
impartial review of existing evidence. Indeed, [an
important]{.underline} [legacy of feminist legal reforms]{.underline} of
the past several decades [has been a progressive]{.underline}
[strengthening of the anti-stereotyping principle in sex-discrimination
law]{.underline}.73 The [vigorous application]{.underline} of a robust
anti-stereotyping principle [in law has played a]{.underline} [critical
role in defeating essentialist]{.underline} [justifications for policies
that promote the subordination of girls and women]{.underline}.74 But
[in the case of boys]{.underline} and men, **[essentialist discourses
are proving more resilient]{.underline}**. No doubt [law]{.underline}
once again [**has a central role to play** in challenging essentialist
policies]{.underline} [that insist we accommodate rather]{.underline}
[than interrogate the basis for masculine]{.underline}
[behavior]{.underline}. VI. GIRLS CAN BE ANYTHING . . . BUT BOYS WILL BE
BOYS After two decades of concerted gender advocacy in the United
States, girls' advocates and boys' advocates are sharply divided when it
comes to questions of gender difference. Building on [legal]{.underline}
[reforms]{.underline} of the 1970s that [were designed]{.underline} [to
curtail sex discrimination]{.underline} [and gender bias in the
classroom]{.underline}, [advocates]{.underline} for girls traditionally
[have emphasized]{.underline} [the need to challenge social
attitudes]{.underline} and practices that stand in the way of girls'
success. Where at one time the dominant social view of girls emphasized
inherent limitations, [there is now a flourishing]{.underline}
[discourse of possibility and "the sky's the limit" thinking about
girls]{.underline}.75 [The same cannot be said in the case of gender
advocacy for boys]{.underline}, where essentialist claims have risen to
the forefront. Indeed, [among boys' advocates]{.underline}, [there is a
growing]{.underline} [demand]{.underline} [to **adjust educational
environments and expectations to accommodate boys' innate capacities and
interests.** What emerges]{.underline}, then, [is a]{.underline}
[divergent discourse]{.underline} about kids, one [which]{.underline}
[simultaneously]{.underline} [proclaims]{.underline} that [girls can do
anything **but boys will be boys**]{.underline}.76 In this way,
contemporary gender discourse in education suggests a striking shift in
what anthropologist Sherry Ortner has called the "underlying logic of
cultural thinking" about sex and gender.77 In a now classic essay, Is
Female to Male as Nature is to Culture?, Ortner declared "the secondary
status of woman" to be "one of the true universals" of human
societies.78 Ortner attributes this "stubborn" fact to the universal
association of woman with nature and man with culture, an attribution
derived from "woman's greater bodily involvement" with reproduction.79
But the message emerging from boys' advocates today suggests a
significant reversal in the familiar terms of gender discourse. In
contemporary education reform debates, it is in [discussions of
girls]{.underline} that we most often [encounter]{.underline} [a
transcendent rhetoric of possibility.]{.underline} [In
contrast]{.underline}, [we are]{.underline} much more likely to be
[warned of the damaging]{.underline} [effects]{.underline} [of pushing
boys beyond biologically-determined cognitive and emotional
limits.]{.underline} One should not presume, however, that this shift
indicates a reversal in the gender hierarchy, for [the]{.underline}
[appropriation of an essentialist discourse]{.underline} [by boys'
advocates]{.underline} may in fact **[serve to reinforce male
privilege.]{.underline}** Today, [appeals]{.underline} to nature
[function]{.underline} [as an implicit rejoinder]{.underline} to the
suggestion [that boys' troubles]{.underline} [emanate]{.underline} in
practices [of gender socialization that reward aggression and
discourage]{.underline} the expression of emotional
[vulnerability]{.underline} in boys and men. Indeed, in the
education-reform debates, [the]{.underline} [assertion of boys'
fixed]{.underline} [and immutable nature]{.underline} **[has emerged as
a powerful tool to subvert interrogation of masculinity]{.underline}**.
From this perspective, among [the most]{.underline}
[important]{.underline} items of [unfinished business]{.underline} for
feminism today **[is a more serious reckoning with the effects of
essentialized masculinity]{.underline}**.80

### A2 No Policy W/O Activism

#### NATO's adoption of WPS was independent of activists---top-down politics solve

The eight WPS resolutions, which make-up the WPS agenda, each have their
own strengths and weaknesses, but it is clear that the greater
engagement there was with the NGO Working Group, the better the outcomes
in terms of aligning with feminist goals. [The continued feminist
engagement with the resolutions is evidenced in the strengthening of the
feminist content in the WPS resolutions. The adoption of the WPS
resolutions has had a number of positive effects, including challenging
the Security Council's conservative approach to gender (Otto, 2010: 98).
The WPS agenda embodied in the resolutions has created a 'snowball
effect' on institutional activity backed by the power of the Security
Council]{.underline} (Otto, 2010: 103). Many parts of the UN structure
have become involved in the implementation of the WPS agenda, for
example, the InterAgency Network on Women and Gender Equality (IANWGE)
established a task force on WPS to coordinate the mainstreaming of WPS
into the UN bureaucracy (Otto, 2010: 103). [The WPS agenda has utility
for a range of actors and settings beyond that envisaged by those who
supported the passage of UNSCR 1325 through the Security
Council]{.underline}. For example, McLeod's (2012: 137) research on
Women in Black in Serbia finds that after learning about UNSCR 1325, the
group conceived ways in which the Resolution could be used strategically
to support their existing goals. Prior to their engagement with the WPS
agenda in 2005, Women in Black did not articulate 'security' as one of
their core values. The use of 'mainstream' language on security to
express feminist goals therefore became a strategy to achieve their
pre-existing objectives. In understanding WPS as a 'travelling concept'
we see how it has moved from transnational feminism to formal acceptance
by the UN Security Council, to national and local engagement by
grassroots civil society actors. NATO's adoption of the WPS agenda adds
an additional dimension to this journey. [NATO did not engage with the
WPS as a response to pressure from feminist civil society nor did it
formally consult civil society until the 2014 iteration of the NATO/EAPC
Policy]{.underline}. Despite the initial NATO/EAPC Policy on WPS adopted
in 2007 calling for civil society consultation, this did not occur
formally until seven years later. [Rather, NATO's initial engagement was
the result of state-level advocacy of the issue which framed WPS as part
of NATO's existing concern with the status of women in the military, as
a tool to increase operational effectiveness and also to engage partner
states. This journey served to remove WPS from a direct link to feminist
advocacy.]{.underline} This leaves open the possibility that NATO's
interpretation of UNSCR 1325 has shaped the WPS agenda itself. This is
something we consider further in Chapter 5 where we discuss how the
concept of a 'gender perspective', initially articulated in UNSCR 1325,
has travelled to and been embraced by NATO.

## Perms

[So far, cybersecurity, defined as "the preservation -- through policy,
technology, and education -- of the availability, confidentiality, and
integrity of information and its underlying infrastructure to enhance
the security of persons both online and offline," has been a key focus
for policymakers and defense institutions. Weaponising a civilian space
has enormous implications for human rights, especially for women who are
already disadvantaged in conflict settings]{.underline}. While national
security matters, we suggest that cybersecurity needs to take human
rights seriously by centering people's empowerment and well-being. [We
see a need to extend the WPS agenda, including 1325 National Action
Plans (NAPs), to the cyber realm to achieve sustainable peace. The WPS
agenda promotes human security by encouraging the participation of women
in peace and security governance.]{.underline} We envision 1325 as
protecting women, girls, trans, queer, and other sexual and gender
minorities from online GBV and ensuring equal access to cybersecurity
both in terms of access to cyber technologies and participating in
cybersecurity governance. [The WPS agenda could be used in cyberspace
to: • Ensure women from diverse backgrounds are in decision-making
positions in cybersecurity governance and expanding the number of women
in cybersecurity across the board, as well as women's equal access to
cyber technologies]{.underline}. As Brown and Pytlak explain,
participation in cyber is critical to representation. [Without women's
full and equal participation, their perspectives are unlikely to be
represented within cyber policy or their perspective taken seriously in
cyber policy.• Provide for the application of a feminist intersectional
approach regarding cyberspace to understand how women, girls, and
diverse gendered categories experience cyberspace
differently]{.underline}. Cyberspace is not equal, and a
one-size-fits-all policy does not work for everyone, particularly, women
and girls in conflict-affected contexts, who might face unique
challenges while using the cyber realm due to weak cyber laws. • Launch
gender-disaggregated data collection on cyber-space tools and resources
countries and businesses in the private sector (Facebook, Twitter,
Tok-tok) are creating and utilising to make cyberspace safer by
protecting the data privacy and security of marginalised groups,
including women and girls as well as trans, queer, nonbinary and other
sexual and gender minorities face in cybersphere. • [Promote training
for cybersecurity professionals, scholars and policymakers on
gender-specific issues in cybersecurity and recognise that achieving
sustainable peace requires achieving a safe cyberspace.]{.underline} We
build on recent work by Feminist IR scholars who have made a case for
using 1325 and the WPS agenda beyond conflict settings. For instance,
Laura Shepherd argues that since no country is violence-free or full of
gender equality, there is a need to apply 1325 beyond war and postwar
contexts. Similarly, in this piece, we try to expand the scope of
application for the WPS agenda to include cyberspace in all contexts,
with a focus on conflict-affected countries. To do so, more feminist
analysis is needed to help us understand how complex social identities
in the cyber realm shape users' experiences and their interaction with
power structures. [Feminist analysis can shed light on how gender and
other inequalities operate in cyberspace and impact human rights and
uniquely impact women and other marginalised groups living in
conflict-affected countries. We see the WPS agenda as a starting point
for scholarly and policy-focused feminist cyber engagement.]{.underline}

### Perm Do Both -- Critical Friend

#### Perm do both---the aff acts as a critical friend to NATO which is key to nuanced understandings that change institutions and avoid co-optation

Much to the benefit of the feminist IR, there are numerous critical
engagements and conversations between feminists on approaches to the
study of security, war and the institutions that wage them. Sylvester
(2013) and Duncanson (2013) acknowledge a tension between what can be
broadly described as an 'anti-militarist' feminism and what Sylvester
calls 'new' feminist war studies that seek to centralise the accounts of
women as agents within institutions of war (2013: 49) (see also Lobasz
and Sjoberg, 2011: 574). [Sylvester notes unease between women who
self-identify as feminists but depart from common advocacy of peaceful
conflict resolution, or a strident anti-militarism. Similarly, Duncanson
(2013) identifies a tension between feminists who view militaries as
useful in the pursuit of peace (Olsson and Tryggestad, 2001; Kaldor,
2012; Kronsell, 2012) and those who are much more sceptical about the
role and place of militaries and militarism (Whitworth, 2004); between
those whom she calls 'feminist sceptics of military intervention' and
'feminist sceptics' (Duncanson, 2013: 2).]{.underline} This tension
becomes acute when considering sites of feminist research and the role
of feminist researcher: as Sylvester (2013: 39) notes: 'Gender and war
is a very fraught coupling and the men and women who join the
institution of war or work within it can put observers in a conundrum:
to support them, take no position, look the other way?[' What Sylvester
is commenting on is the notion that by centralising institutions of war
and the individuals that choose to work within them as a site of
feminist analysis, this somehow promotes, reinforces and legitimates
those structures. Yet, Kronsell (2005, 2006, 2012) highlights how solely
focusing on women at the 'margins' of International Relations, on those
'outside of hegemonic institutions' such as the military, tends to
underestimate the significance of the transformative work of those women
who work 'inside' such organisations (Kronsell, 2005: 289). In advancing
a 'revitalised' standpoint theory, Kronsell (2005: 289) also argues that
a reluctance to engage with women within hegemonic institutions
perpetuates certain assumptions about them:]{.underline} Women within
such institutions have been perceived as either co-opted or too few to
be representative of women's knowledge or standpoint. Standpoint
theory's tendency to emphasise knowledge generated by women only in
particular 'women's spaces' has led to the implication that an
occasional woman with power is either a male in disguise or a mere
token. It is not our intention to promote, reinforce or legitimate NATO
as an international actor through this book. But it is our intent to
offer a feminist critique of its gendered institutional norms, practices
and structures by centralising the experience of those women who have
worked and continue to work within it. [We see our role as 'critical
friends'.]{.underline} In introducing this concept of a 'critical
friend' we build on the work of Rech et al. (2015: 56). [They contend
that the study of the military, of militarism, and of processes of
militarisation, should not be undertaken solely for its own sake, but
should also be guided by the possibility of engagement with the forces
and institutions responsible, and should not be bashful about doing so.
This is because such institutions are ultimately accountable to the
civilian world, and understanding how they function is necessary to
critique them (rather than dismiss them) (Enloe, 1993; Rech et al.,
2015: 56).]{.underline} Being a 'critical friend' means rejecting
problem-solving approaches which 'takes the world as it finds it' and
aims 'to makes these relationships and institutions work smoothly by
dealing effectively with particular sources of trouble' (Cox, 1981:
128--9). Rather, it means adopting a critical approach which calls these
institutions into question and accounts for the possibility of their
change. [In so doing it opens up the possibility for research to be
normatively guided]{.underline} (Cox, 1981: 129--30). [Being a 'critical
friend' to military institutions therefore entails engaging in complex
and nuanced arguments and situating these in broader political
considerations and in more nuanced ways than simplistic 'pro-military'
or 'anti-military' positions are able to accommodate]{.underline} (Rech
et al., 2015: 56). [It means a commitment to praxis, which necessities
engagement. Military institutions are often secretive, complex and
contradictory, this means critical agendas can be vulnerable to
co-option (as we discuss in Chapter 4). Researchers as 'critical
friends' therefore need to engage in an ongoing process of reflexivity
from the outset of any project.]{.underline}

## Impacts

### A2 Extinction

#### Gender is not the root cause of violence or ontological and cant explain the case \-- violence is constructed by many axes of oppression

Olena **Hankivsky 12**, Professor in the School of Public Policy, Simon
Fraser University, June 2012, Women's health, men's health, and gender
and health: Implications of intersectionality, Social Science &
Medicine,
http://www.sciencedirect.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/science/article/pii/S0277953612000408

Using an intersectionality framework, [researchers have
noted]{.underline} the [explanatory limitations of single axis designs
centered on]{.underline} sex and [gender]{.underline}. Cole (2009) has
warned that [analyses that focus on gender are problematic because they
often "implicitly assume a host of other social statuses that usually go
unnamed in American culture: middle-class standing, heterosexuality,
able-bodiedness and White race]{.underline}" (p. 173). Others have
explicated similar limitations. For example, [studies in the field of
violence]{.underline} (Bent-Goodley, 2007; Craig-Taylor, 2008; Crenshaw,
1995; Nixon & Humphreys, 2010; Sandelowski, Barroso, & Voils, 2009)
[show that violence against women is not only a matter of gendered power
relationships but is co-constructed with racial and class
stratification, heterosexism, ageism, and other systems of oppression,
some of which may be more salient within such interactions. Research on
cardiovascular disease (CVD)]{.underline} (Brister, Hamdulay, Verma,
Maganti, & Buchanan, 2007; King, LeBlanc, Carr, & Quan, 2007; King,
LeBlanc, Sanguins, & Mather, 2006) [shows that focussing on sex and
gender often obscures the fact that CVD is disproportionately
experienced by racial ethnic and low-income groups whose lives are
shaped by intersecting processes of differentiation along the lines of
age, sex, ethnic group affiliation, socioeconomic class, and
geography]{.underline}. Finally[, HIV/AIDS research]{.underline}
(Dworkin, 2005; Elford, Anderson, Bukutu, & Ibrahim, 2006; Jackson &
Reimer, 2008; Meyer, Costenbader, Zule, Otiashvili, & Kirtadze, 2010;
Young & Meyer, 2005) [demonstrates that gender and sexuality cannot be
separated from other axes including race, class, age, religious
affiliation, and immigration status and the structural economic,
political, and social processes that shape them.]{.underline} For
example, in her analysis of surveillance categories for HIV, Dworkin
(2005) argues that **[pushing beyond a singular]{.underline}**
[sex/gender **system**]{.underline} [to explore the simultaneity of
race, class, and shifting gender relations is vital to the future of the
HIV epidemic and in particular, for making visible bisexual and lesbian
transmission risks]{.underline}. Emerging research thus demonstrates
that **[there are many groups which "do not necessarily identify gender
oppression as the primary frame through which they understand their
lives"]{.underline}** (Nixon & Humphreys, 2010, p. 150). In Canada, as
in many other jurisdictions, this is especially apparent with growing
[immigrant populations]{.underline} whose [health is primarily affected
by dislocation, isolation, loss of identity, culture, and meaningful
employment and Aboriginal/Indigenous populations whose health and
well-being is largely determined by unresolved colonial injustices and
ongoing experiences of racism and poverty]{.underline} (Alfred, 2005;
Waldrum, Herring, & Young, 2006).¶ Further, the emphasis on gender (and
sex) often leads to a focus on differences between women and men. This
helps to explain why so much data continues to be collected, organized,
and presented solely around sex and gender differences even when
similarities between women and men are demonstrated (e.g. Hyde, 2005;
Petersen, 2009), differences among women and among men are often as
significant if not more than between women and men (Crawshaw & Smith,
2009; Varcoe, Hankivsky, & Morrow, 2007), and men are sometimes
subordinate to some women and some women exercise power over some men
(Pease, 2006). Nevertheless, numerous reviews of sex based and gender
differences continue to be produced (Gochfeld, 2010; Read & Gorman,
2010). Moreover, even in some frameworks that seek to include
considerations of both sex and gender, as in the sex and gender based
analysis (SGBA) tool developed in Canada (e.g. Clow et al., 2009),
proposed guides construct lines of interrogation that prioritize
examinations of similarities and differences between women and men. As
Clow et al. (2009) state, "SGBA reminds us to ask questions about
similarities and differences among women and men, such as: Do women and
men have the same susceptibility to lung disease from smoking? Are women
at the same risk as men of contracting HIV/AIDS through heterosexual
intercourse? Are the symptoms of heart disease the same in women and
men?." (p. 1). Within this type of construct, [differences that are
shaped and formed by factors outside of sex and gender are treated as
secondary in importance, if at all.]{.underline}

While [feminists]{.underline} usually try to ground the meanings that
they study, [theorizing the mundane or]{.underline} the [everyday
may]{.underline} very [well represent a]{.underline} detour ---or even a
**[dead end]{.underline}**---[if bread-and-butter issues related
to]{.underline} the [security]{.underline} and economic well-being of
ordinary women and men [are ignored]{.underline}. [What value does
feminist theorizing]{.underline} (even if it draws from women's lived
experiences) [have in war-affected contexts where meeting **immediate
needs** is **paramount**?]{.underline} [At what point does the
theorizing of the body under such circumstances become a means to
satisfying **intellectual fetishes**?]{.underline} Theorizing the
everyday is messy because it has to contend with the immediate social
setting in which popular culture is inseparable from the economic
materiality of the conditions of oppression. In response to this
dilemma, my aim is to argue for a productive rather than a reductive
relationship between Feminist Security Studies (FSS) and Feminist
(International) Political Economy (FPE), achieved through a reframed
relationship between discursive subjectivity and a structure-centred
materiality. I argue for a more systematic feminist analysis that
reunites FPE and cultural FSS critiques. This analytical synthesis is
based on an understanding of the co-constituted agency of discourse and
materiality underpinned by a postcolonial-feminist attention to the
politics of space. After the Cold War, security became a catch-all
concept for critical variants of IR, but instead of working against
disciplinary fragmentation, "security has settled into each new camp in
particularistic ways" (Sylvester 2013, 618). For FSS the main concern is
to underscore the conceptual necessity of gender to understanding
security. Although scholars have also emphasized the theoretical and
methodological diversity of FSS, I contend that [there is an implicit
hierarchy]{.underline} of sorts [when it comes to which critical
tradition matters more theoretically or
epistemologically]{.underline}---[with a]{.underline} subtle but
**[distinct privileging of the discursive]{.underline}** as evidenced by
the influential contributions of, among others, Judith Butler (1993),
Karin Fierke (2013a), Lene Hansen (2006), and Laura Shepherd (2008).
[FSS]{.underline} thus [tends to focus on the gendered, discursive
construction of forms of violence with **less attention paid to
materialities of**]{.underline} economic **[insecurity]{.underline}**.
In contrast, FPE tends to avoid the security frame and its discursive
implications and concentrates more on gender as a social relation of
inequality and the gendered effects of capitalism or economic
globalization. Poststructuralist scholarship in FSS insists that the
discursive is not privileged over the material and that objects in the
material world and human subjects both take their forms and agencies
relationally, as they are embedded within particular locations.
Similarly, gendered and embodied security is theorized to be the outcome
of relational processes ---performed in, by, and through those
relations. Theory thus makes practice (Foucault 1972). Yet, [thinking
about our bodies as cultural constructs, produced as objects in security
discourse, has a high level of abstraction]{.underline}. [Before we can
analyze discourse about bodies, shouldn't we first make the bodies from
"other worlds,"]{.underline} rooted in everyday struggles of human
insecurity, [feature in IR?]{.underline} [How is attention to
contextualized discourses of individuals or groups without considering
their basic needs different from what liberal feminists are
doing]{.underline}, namely [treating those whose security is at stake as
abstract, silent, rights-bearing individuals with no
culture?]{.underline} Moreover, [for all this talk about interactions
between language and matter (as if they were equal), "**language"
remains the star of the show**]{.underline}, as evidenced in Karin
Fierke's claim that "embodied security is . . . fundamentally bound up
in the interaction between humans and their material environment, both
of which are constituted in and through language" (Fierke 2013b, 16).
Theoretically, materiality should gain agency through the fact that it
cannot ontologically be separated from discursive forces but in practice
discourses treat material practices (bodies) as effects (objects) rather
than causes (subjects), and consequently maintain agency (Wilcox 2012).
**[A subtle hierarchy is]{.underline}** therefore
**[imposed]{.underline}**. Reversing the starting point of the inquiry
may succeed in troubling dualistic thinking but does not transcend it.
[We may have thrown the baby out with the bathwater when we privileged
the effects of cultural constructions of gender difference at the
expense of the **material effects of**]{.underline} bodies, economic
justice, and **[security]{.underline}** (see Fraser 2013). **[There are
clearly limits to discursive analysis]{.underline}**, [especially when
it comes to connecting physical insecurity and the materiality of
insecurity linked to structures]{.underline}. We must therefore look to
the so-called "new materialisms" on posthumanist agency (Connolly 2013),
material feminisms (Hughes 2013), and Feminist IPE. Feminist IPE as a
diverse body of scholarship studies structures, social practices, and
the meanings of the global political economy (Griffin 2010; Peterson
2007). The emphasis falls on specifically gendered bodies while also
foregrounding differences that are based upon material and structural
inequalities as well as intersectional relations of disadvantage (e.g.,
gender, institutionalized racism, or ethnicity). In this regard, FPE may
find itself closer than FSS to a radical definition of human security as
everyday life experiences embedded in global structures of inclusion and
exclusion and can keep FSS honest by guiding it back to a concern with
everyday (economic) insecurities.

The basic task of dismantling and decentering the current theoretical
paradigms of mainstream IR by challenging its "western" origins served
as the foundation to call into question the supposed objectivity of
knowledge developed within the boundaries of this discipline (Sign
Systems, and Knowledge). [This ultimately leads to deconstruction of the
masculinities]{.underline}, and consequently, [the femininities derived
from mainstream IR]{.underline}, which challenges the universalism of
its principles. These principles are the basis under which knowledge is
disseminated within the field and they dominate the ways in which we
think about the world. [Thus, to deconstruct and challenge these
principles then "problematizes" all of the concepts and practices
derived from them]{.underline}. When considering how feminist IR
challenged and problematized development, this served as the basis for
the building tasks of practices and politics. [While international
relations and the international system advocate for development as
benevolent, in practice, this concept has been enacted (]{.underline}at
times[) with various self-interested outcomes by those in positions of
power.]{.underline} Tickner pointedly referred to development as a
"western project" and other theorists critiqued the western frame of
development models and practices. Furthermore, if one thinks about the
politics of development, this concept is complexly used to withhold
social goods such as foreign aid or development assistance.¶ [The
buildings tasks of relationships, identities, and connections are
closely intertwined and dependent upon each other, especially in
feminist IR. The literature also challenged]{.underline}, developed,
[and weaved together]{.underline} the various [aspects of identity of
women]{.underline} around the world. Challenging the views of women in
the developing world also involved challenging how women in the
developed world view their own status and position. [Take]{.underline},
for example, [the concepts of complicity and insider/outsider
identities]{.underline}. [The feminist IR literature strongly asserted
that through actions such as underpaid household labor or unfair labor
practices used to produce]{.underline} 57 [globally-shipped goods
(]{.underline}e.g[. buying items produced in sweatshops]{.underline})
[women have participated in aspects of patriarchy that disadvantage
others]{.underline}. Another example is "femocrats" or women in power
who condone---or even advocate---certain policies that are steeped in
hegemonic masculinity, such as war. These are women that have upheld
certain aspects of patriarchy because it is beneficial to maintaining
their own power. Thus, it forces women in the developed world to think
about their relationship and connection to their counterparts in
developing countries, particularly in ways that do not create them as
abstract figures. If these women are oppressed, if they are "third
world"; if they are disadvantaged, then, those in the "first world" are
not disconnected from their position. This oppression did not---and does
not---happen by coincidence. Women in the First World/developed
countries/Global North bear some responsibility, whether implicitly or
explicitly, in maintaining the disadvantaged social status of those
outside the west.¶ Furthermore, an interesting aspect of this analysis
of feminist IR literature was not in how these pieces talked about women
in developing countries or the "Third World," but in how these women
weren't spoken about. Not in terms of making them invisible, but in not
attempting to describe them; not attempting to speak for them, but
straying away from one-dimensional or homogenized views of their lives.
It seemed that the goal was simply to "trouble" the existing images and
ways in which we think about these women and their lives. The task was
not necessarily to describe, but instead, to deconstruct. Perhaps, this
was a method to counter existing, problematic narratives, but without
co-opting the stories of marginalized women for scholarly purposes.¶ The
previously identified themes and categories will be carried forward to
the second part of the discourse analysis on policy literature. The
purpose of the next chapter is to see if any of 58 these objects in
feminist IR literature have influenced and/or appear in the discourse of
international women's development policy.¶ Summary When looking at the
overall discourse of feminist IR literature, [the not only stresses the
idea of adding women to IR, but which women are added and whose voices
are heard]{.underline}. [This is disruptive to the discipline because of
its agendered assumptions]{.underline}. [The texts repeatedly and
purposefully situate gender and international relations **within a
western context**]{.underline}, to serve as a reminder that the
international system has a specific sociocultural frame. [This creates
situated identities within this frame that may have been imposed upon
individuals]{.underline}, **[particularly women in the "Third World"/
"Developing" world/ "Global South]{.underline}**." [By giving examples
of women's agency]{.underline}, particularly in reference to women's
movements and civil society, [it serves to uncover and build an image of
these women]{.underline} [separate from "western" created
concepts]{.underline}. Often, images of marginalized individuals are
depicted in relation to those in power, highlighting the (hierarchical)
differences. Telling a plurality of stories decenters the singular frame
in which one can see the world.¶ [Despite these attempts at
disruption]{.underline}, [the use of dichotomies shows the power of
language and that one can only exist so far "outside the
system"]{.underline} (even when aware of its pitfalls). This "discursive
slippage" is a result of unconscious, habitual, and inherited language
(Hooper, 2001; Runyan & Peterson, 2010). [The continued use of
western-imposed, hierarchical dichotomies means that uncovering new ways
to view international relations requires new language to speak about
international relations.]{.underline} [**Otherwise, feminist IR will**
**disrupt discourse in one context, while entrenching it in
another**.]{.underline}

The field of feminist security studies highlights how "security" is
interrelated to issues of gender and sex in many important ways (Wibben
and Stern 2014; Hudson 2011, 586; see also Sjoberg 2009; Sjoberg and
Martin 2010). [Although feminist security studies strongly challenges
the dominant, repressive, and invariably patriarchal ways in which
national security, international security coalitions, foreign policy
priorities, and defence mechanisms are conceived, it is a considerably
"restrictive" field]{.underline}. Publications in journals such as
Politics and Gender demonstrate that the near-totality of contributors
are cis, white, able-bodied women in Western academia. [Feminist
security studies focuses invariably on the gender binary, thereby
limiting its brand of feminism to cis (and largely white) able-bodied
women. It is a field that seldom accommodates a diversity of
perspectives or includes voices of women of color, Indigenous women, or
Trans and queer feminist scholars and activists]{.underline}. This
approach to feminist security studies perpetuates a cycle of exclusion
and exceptionalism, adjudicating on who gets to articulate what in the
field, and who gets academic credence as a "feminist." [Concluding an
article on feminist security studies, Hudson (2011, 589) calls upon
fellow academics in that research area to avoid inflicting unto others
what has been done unto them in the past in the form of exclusionary
practices and in defining the boundaries of feminist security studies to
say who is in and who is out. In terms of theorizing, critical voices on
the potential of feminist security studies to engage with and
destabilize gendered power relations are receiving increasing scholarly
attention]{.underline} (see, e.g., Åhäll 2016). Yet even such critical
voices take a considerably cisgender feminist turn, with subjective and
restrictive interpretations of what is implied by "feminist." In
Practice: The Gender Binary as the Status Quo in International Politics
The consequences of mostly whitefeminist theorizing of international
relations and security studies can be observed in the agendas and
targets of supranational organizations, regional bodies, and powerful
governments. The UN's gender policies and strategic goals, as well as
those of powerful governments, are structured in a way that perpetuates
gender-related conservatisms and norms, which, to borrow from Ahmed
(2016, 23), are also heteronorms. The UN's concept of gender
mainstreaming involves ensuring that the goal of gender equality is made
central to all activities---policy development, research, advocacy,
legislation, resource allocation, planning, implementation, and
monitoring of programs and projects (UN Women, n.d.). Many scholars of
feminist IR have explored challenges and inconsistencies in the way in
which gender mainstreaming is perceived by the UN and other
supranational bodies (see, e.g., Youngs 2008; Daly 2005; Rees, 2005;
Walby 2005; Perrons, 2005; Beveridge and Nott 2002; Hafner-Burton and
Pollack 2002; True 2003, 2009, 2010). [Gender mainstreaming, as it is
practiced by the international community, persistently interprets
"gender" around the "heteronormative binary" (see Zalewski 2010, 21--22)
and consequently regularly ignores interfaces between race, sex, gender,
nationality, ethnicity, sexuality, and power]{.underline} (25; see also
Jauhola 2010). Today, [UN bodies have begun to pay increased attention
to Transgender issues through their emphasis on sexual orientation,
gender identity/expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC),
especially in collaboration with platforms such as the International
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Association (ILGA).
However, the overall ethos of such engagements continues to be somewhat
inconsistent, in that they fail to acknowledge the salient reality that
anti- Trans discrimination---if not discrimination against gender
identities that do not fall within the binary---is inherently linked to
misogyny, patriarchal oppression, and inequities that are at the heart
of gender-related oppression, which especially take their toll on
underprivileged cis women of color in the Global South, Indigenous
peoples across the world, and also women from ethnic minorities in the
West.]{.underline}10 In a similar vein, the UN's women, peace, and
security (WPS) agenda is also essentially founded not only upon a narrow
and restrictive understanding of gender(s) fixed on the gender binary,
but also on the basis of stereotyping (cisgender) women as the
vulnerable "other." [Even when discussing women affected by armed
conflict, WPS resolutions locate the (cisgender) male soldier as the
ultimate referent]{.underline} (Jansson and Eduards 2016, 12). A
fast-growing body of work examines the rationale and problems of
implementing WPS resolutions (Olonisakin, Barnes, and Ikpe 2011; Gizelis
and Olsson 2015; Farr 2011; Barnes 2011; Harrington 2011; Reeves 2012;
Adrian-Paul 2012). Scholars of feminist security studies have also
critically engaged with the WPS agenda (Pratt and Richter-Devroe 2011;
Schnabel and Tabyshalieva 2012; Boyd 2014). Critics highlight that
Resolution 1325 does not confront the structural roots of gender
inequalities, including entrenched understandings of patriarchy,
masculinity, and militarized power (Barnes 2011). Resolution 1325 and
the subsequent WPS resolutions (including Resolution 2122 of 2013)
largely perceive women through a prism of wartime victimhood (see, e.g.,
Meger 2016). This logic locates the cis male soldier as the agent of
preventing violence against women, and, as scholars have repeatedly
pointed out, legitimizes military activity once sexual violence against
women is addressed. In sum, the UN's conception of gender equates cis
women and cisnormative femininity with peace and is entrenched in
cisnormative gender stereotypes (Shepherd 2008). This reading of women
in contexts of armed conflict fails to identify patriarchy as the
primary cause of violence against women, which prevents UN resolutions
from consistently addressing the exclusion of women and gender-plural
people from conflict management initiatives. It also prevents
supranational bodies (and governments) from focusing on a logic of
addressing the visceral excesses of patriarchal attitudes and developing
a consistent logic of women's empowerment, especially in post-war
contexts in the Global South. The problems inherent in the WPS agenda
and gender mainstreaming primarily stem from the fact that the very
authority that drafts these policy guidelines is also one that is
largely spearheaded by influential states with power acquired through
centuries of colonization, and by white settler-controlled authorities
that are squarely responsible for the human, socioeconomic, cultural,
and linguistic genocide of First Peoples, especially women and
gender-plural peoples of Turtle Island and elsewhere. Since its
inception, the UN has proved to be incapable of addressing atrocities
committed by these powers upon non-white peoples. Western superpowers
have carte blanche on the international sphere, often justifying their
military aggressions and violence in foreign lands on the basis of
protectionist discourses along (cis)gender faultlines, such as the
often-repeated "objective" of protecting "women and children," echoing a
discourse of masculinist protectionism built upon a patriarchal and
hence patronizing understanding of democratic citizenship and world
politics. In the face of such discourses, the UN has been conspicuously
silent and partaking in the agendas of Western powers. This calls into
question the UN's capability, in its present form, of addressing the
challenges facing women/gender minorities in contexts of armed conflict
and natural disaster. [An effective strategy must be grounded in the
recognition of a broader understanding of gender beyond the binary, and
a decolonizing logic of empowering cis and Trans women and all other
gender-plural people]{.underline}. Most importantly, such an approach
must profoundly challenge the logics of warfare as articulated by
powerful states and ensure that women and gender-plural people occupy
frontline roles in all aspects of conflict management and resolution
initiatives. It is in articulating a policy perspective of this nature,
with decolonizing, equity, justice, and empowerment at the center, that
a Transfeminist approach to IR will gain prime significance. As outlined
below, [key ideas in Transfeminism, when applied to IR, provide a
promising avenue to develop a strongly intersectional, feminist, Global
South(s)-focused and decolonizing twenty-first-century perspective on
world politics]{.underline}.
