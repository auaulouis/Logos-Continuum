# CHINA TRADEOFF DA

### Notes

#### Overview:

Simple argument that an increased military focus on NATO trades-off with
efforts to deter China. Budget, personnel, and time are all finite so
investments in security cooperation are "zero-sum." The "Asian Pivot"
has been a priority for a while now because China is revisionist and is
the number one threat to US interests. Ukraine complicated that switch,
but the US is back to prioritizing China and deterring aggression
against Taiwan (and the rest of Asia). The plan both physically and
perceptually detracts from US efforts and invites aggression from China.
A war over Taiwan goes nuclear and is arguably a bigger threat than
anything in Ukraine.

#### Pros:

There is a big debate on the necessity for an Asian Pivot and solid link
evidence about the inability for the US to fight on two fronts, so the
trade-off lit is pretty good. The impacts are comparatively bigger. The
risk of escalation in Ukraine is lower now and Russia was exposed as
less of a threat than expected. China on the other hand has the same
aggressive intentions but more power. There's ev in the file that
actually makes the comparison, so if you win a unique link, you can
outweigh.

#### Cons:

Weak uniqueness. Ukraine is going to thump a lot of DAs. All the link
evidence about the trade-off is descriptive of the status quo
(suggesting that Biden is failing by getting too involved in NATO and
not enough in Asia). It's also possible for the military to "chew gum
and walk" at the same time.

NATO,' defense secretary says," 2022.06.11,

The U.S. defense secretary emphasized partnership as the main priority
for the American security strategy in the Indo-Pacific during a keynote
speech in Singapore on Saturday, but stressed that the U.S. was not
seeking to create "an Asian NATO." [The United States remains "deeply
invested" and committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific]{.underline},
Lloyd Austin said in a 30-minute speech during the first plenary session
of the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum here. "We do not seek
confrontation and conflict and we do not seek a new Cold War, an Asian
NATO or a region split into hostile blocs," the U.S. defense chief said,
referring to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Russian President
Vladimir Putin had cited Ukraine's interest in joining the regional
inter-governmental alliance as a reason for launching an invasion of the
smaller country next-door in late February. [The United States and its
allies in the Indo-Pacific have recently expressed concern over China's
increasingly assertive military posture in the region]{.underline}, and
that the war in Ukraine might encourage Beijing even more. Beijing, for
its part, has been complaining about what it sees as attempts by the
U.S. and its partners to form a defense alliance in the region. When
leaders from the U.S., Japan, India and Australia met last month for a
summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, China cried
foul. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Washington was "keen to gang up with
'small circles' and change China's neighborhood environment," making
Asia-Pacific countries serve as "pawns" of the U.S. hegemony. "I think
Secretary Austin made it very clear that there's no appetite for an
Asian NATO," said Blake Herzinger, a Singapore-based defense analyst.
"The U.S. values collective partnerships with shared visions and
priorities, without the need to form a defense alliance," he told
BenarNews. 'A region free from coercion and bullying' [The U.S will
"continue to stand by our friends as they uphold their
rights,"]{.underline} said Austin, adding that the commitment is
"especially important as the People's Republic of China adopts a more
coercive and aggressive approach to its territorial claims." He spoke of
the Chinese air force's almost daily incursions into Taiwan's Air
Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) and an "alarming" increase in the
number of unsafe and unprofessional encounters between Chinese planes
and vessels with those of other countries. Most recently, U.S. ally
Australia accused China of conducting a "dangerous intercept," of one of
its surveillance aircraft near the Paracel Islands in the South China
Sea. On Friday, Austin met with his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, on
the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue. During the meeting that lasted
nearly an hour, the two sides discussed how to better manage their
relationship and prevent accidents from happening but did not reach any
concrete resolution. Austin used his speech on Saturday to remind
Beijing that "big powers carry big responsibilities," saying "we'll do
our part to manage these tensions responsibly -- to prevent conflict,
and to pursue peace and prosperity." [The Indo-Pacific is the U.S.
Department of Defense's (DOD) "**priority theater**,"]{.underline} he
noted, [adding that his department's fiscal year **2023 budget request**
calls for one of the largest investments in history to preserve the
region\'s security. This includes the U.S. \$6.1 billion for the Pacific
Deterrence Initiative to strengthen multilateral information-sharing and
support training and experimentation with partners.]{.underline} [The
budget also seeks to encourage innovation across all domains, including
space and cyberspace, "to develop new capabilities that will allow us to
deter aggression even more surely]{.underline}," he said. [The U.S.
military is expanding exercises and training programs with regional
partners, the]{.underline} defense secretary said. Later in June, [the
Pentagon will host the]{.underline} 28th Rim of the Pacific ([RIMPAC)
naval exercise]{.underline} with forces from 26 countries, 38 ships and
nearly 25,000 personnel. Next year, a Coast Guard cutter will be
deployed to Southeast Asia and Oceania, he said, "the first major U.S.
Coast Guard cutter permanently stationed in the region." [Protecting
Taiwan]{.underline} "Secretary Austin offered a compelling vision,
grounded in American resolve to uphold freedom from coercion and oppose
the dangerously outmoded concept of aggressively-carved spheres of
influence," said Andrew Erickson, research director of the China
Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College, speaking in a
personal capacity. [**"The key will be for Washington to match Austin's
rhetoric with requisite resolve and resources** long after today's
Dialogue is over]{.underline}," Erickson said. "It is that
follow-through that will determine much in what President Biden rightly
calls the 'Decisive Decade'," he added. Last month in Tokyo, Biden
announced a new Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness
(IPMDA) that Austin said would provide better access to space-based,
maritime domain awareness to countries across the region. [The U.S.
defense secretary spoke at length about his government's policy towards
Taiwan, saying "we're determined to uphold the status quo that has
served this region so well for so long."]{.underline} While remaining
committed to the longstanding one-China policy, the U.S. categorically
opposes "any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side." "We
do not support Taiwan independence. And we stand firmly behind the
principle that cross-strait differences must be resolved by peaceful
means," Austin said. [The U.S. continues assisting Taiwan in maintaining
self-defense capability]{.underline} and this week approved the sale of
U.S. \$120 million in spare parts and technical assistance for the
Taiwanese navy.

#### b. Link: Security cooperation is zero-sum. Focus on Europe trades-off with Asia. The aff escalates US involvement in NATO at the expense of deterring China.

Ability to Counter China," The Strategist, MAR 16, 2022,
<https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/op-ed-war-in-ukraine-threatens-america-s-ability-to-counter-china>)

As the United States slides deeper into a proxy war with Russia,
Indo-Pacific countries are increasingly concerned about the long-term
implications of the Ukraine crisis for America's power and position in
this part of the world. And so they should be. While President Joe
[Biden's initial approach to Ukraine struck the right
**balance**]{.underline} of resolve and restraint---marshalling global
allies in support of sanctions against Russia and funnelling military
and humanitarian aid to Ukraine---the war is now sapping more and more
American attention and defence resources. [A dangerous tit for tat is
taking hold. Washington's lethal military aid and economy-breaking
sanctions signal an investment in the war that could slip beyond Biden's
original articulation of limited interests.]{.underline} Russia's
nuclear threats and increasingly brutal operations have triggered
further US involvement, including the deployment of advanced F-35
fighters and expensive Patriot missile-defence systems to NATO
frontlines in Eastern Europe, and a massive \$13.6 billion Ukraine
emergency bill passed by Congress last week. Calls are getting louder
for a 'limited no-fly zone' which, though rebuffed so far, may become
politically harder to resist. All this is understandable given the
humanitarian carnage. But hot on the heels of the release of Biden's
Indo-Pacific strategy, [it's unsettling to watch Washington's
**strategic gaze** drift]{.underline}, once again, [away from a robust
\"pivot to Asia.\"]{.underline} As we argue in a new United States
Studies Centre report, these developments are especially worrying given
that the Biden administration has so far failed to deliver on key
defense components of its regional strategy. [Senior US officials insist
that events in Europe will not see the Indo-Pacific or efforts to
balance Chinese power deprioritised]{.underline}. Earlier this month,
the White House's Indo-Pacific coordinator, Kurt Campbell, again
promised that Washington was capable of sustaining \"deep commitments\"
in both theaters simultaneously, even at great cost, just as it had in
the past. [But while America can]{.underline}---and must---c[ontinue to
buttress European security, it doesn't enjoy the luxury of riches or
unchallenged military primacy required to underwrite an expansive global
strategy against two great-power rivals. Matching ends with means in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}---America's so-called 'priority
theatre'---[requires difficult **trade-offs** between **competing
priorities**, including in Ukraine]{.underline}. A more sustainable
division of US and allied defense responsibilities in Europe and Asia is
urgently required. Biden understands this and deserves credit for
attempting to match US global interests and commitments in his first
year. [Poor execution aside, his Afghan withdrawal showed a willingness
to make tough, politically unpopular trade-offs]{.underline}. [His
initially **restrained approach** to the Ukraine crisis suggested he
would keep it in global strategic perspective]{.underline}. But
Washington won't be able to sideline Moscow from its foreign policy
agenda the way it had hoped. Delays to the publication of the US
national defense strategy and national security strategy suggest that
Russia is forcing a hurried reassessment of Biden's global priorities.
[In a worst-case scenario for the Indo-Pacific, it's possible these
documents will return US military strategy to an equally weighted focus
on Asia and Europe---contradicting hard-fought efforts in recent years
to make **China the Pentagon's outright priority.**]{.underline} This is
not a callous point to make. [America simply doesn't have the military
resources required to prosecute an effective multi-theater strategy in
an era of great-power rivalry]{.underline}. [Nor is it spending enough
to change this equation]{.underline}: while the 2018 national defence
strategy recommended three to five percent real growth in defense
spending annually to keep pace with China and Russia, not a single
defense budget since has met these targets. Biden's budget continues
this unsatisfactory trend. And in contrast to the stark warnings from
top brass at US Indo-Pacific Command, who see conflict with China as a
possibility this decade, the administration's defense budget prioritizes
long-term military modernization in anticipation of high-end conflict in
the 2030s - leaving the US underprepared to deal with Chinese military
coercion over the next few years. Budget shortfalls are mirrored by
slow-moving efforts to realign US forces globally. [Efforts to empower
US allies are even more important as Washington is once again pulled in
conflicting global directions]{.underline}. Indo-Pacific allies should
advocate for more. As a priority, Australia should caucus with Japan and
other close security partners to push for overdue reforms to US export
controls on defense technology. [Indo-Pacific allies should also press
Washington for greater insight and input into its regional military
planning. A credible collective defence strategy requires clarity on
when, where and how to address shared defence challenges. Biden's effort
to build support among regional allies for a Taiwan contingency is a
step in this direction]{.underline}. But while [Taiwan is the Pentagon's
\"pacing challenge]{.underline},\" regional countries face Chinese
military coercion across a far wider range of lower intensity scenarios,
as China's intimidation of an Australian military aircraft in the
Arafura Sea last month attests. New strategic planning initiatives must
reflect these realities. In the end, however, these initiatives can't
change the strategic physics of the Indo-Pacific. A favorable balance of
power with China can only be upheld with unprecedented US support.
Alliance modernization is a necessary component of this strategy, but
it's not a substitute for a robust US military posture and presence in
the Indo-Pacific. As the conflict in Ukraine grinds on, [America's
capacity to deliver an effective defense strategy for the region **will
depend on its ability to keep its escalating involvement in check** and
in global strategic perspective.]{.underline}

#### c. Impact:

#### 1. A failed Asian Pivot emboldens China to invade Taiwan. 

**Sacks '22** (David, research fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations, where his work focuses on U.S.-China relations, U.S.-Taiwan
relations, Chinese foreign policy, cross-Strait relations, and the
political thought of Hans Morgenthau, "Don\'t Pivot From the Pivot to
Asia," Council on Foreign Relations,
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/dont-pivot-pivot-asia)//BB>

[With]{.underline} Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline}, major
[war has returned to Europe and with it calls for the United States to
prioritize countering the present threat posed by Russia
over]{.underline} the threat [China]{.underline} could one day pose.
[But Russia's ineffectiveness on the battlefield, paired with the
increasing investments European nations are making in their defense,
gives the United States a better opportunity than ever **to finally
pivot to Asia** and **focus on the more formidable challenge China
represents**]{.underline}. [A failure to do so could **embolden China**
and give Beijing an **opening to increase its influence**, to the
detriment of U.S. security and prosperity]{.underline}. Over a decade
ago, President [Obama announced the "pivot]{.underline}" or "rebalance"
to Asia in a speech to the Australian Parliament, declaring "the United
States is turning our attention to the vast potential of the Asia
Pacific region." The president's speech followed an essay by Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton entitled "America's Pacific Century," where she
argued for a "strategic turn to the region." All too often, however, the
United States has failed to pair this ambitious rhetoric with policies
that reflected the region's importance. Now, Putin's aggression against
Ukraine has led to a growing consensus that the United States needs
[**to**]{.underline} view Russia as its primary geopolitical challenge
and **[shift resources to Europe]{.underline}**. But such a
reorientation of U.S. strategy **[would]{.underline}** again [**delay
the pivot** to Asia just when it is both **more necessary and more
viable than ever**]{.underline}. The reasoning may be counterintuitive
but holds all the same. The [war in Ukraine has revealed Russia's
military is incapable of waging modern warfare and does not have the
ability to fundamentally threaten NATO]{.underline}. Russia failed to
establish air superiority over Ukraine, its logistics are in shambles,
and morale among its soldiers is reportedly dangerously low. The
defining image of this war thus far is of a stalled Russian convoy
stretching forty miles on a road leading to Kyiv. Overcoming these
issues will take years and require a fundamental overhaul of Russia's
military culture and doctrine. Russia will have to undertake these
difficult reforms with its military in tatters. While it is difficult to
know exactly how many casualties Russia has suffered in Ukraine, it is
well into the thousands, and the Russian military will likely suffer far
greater losses if it attempts to take Kyiv. [Russia has lost some of its
most advanced fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, and artillery, while
depleting its munitions. It will take a long time for Russia to rebuild
its material strength, a prospect that will be even more daunting given
the sanctions that are in force]{.underline}. [The crisis in Ukraine has
also forced European countries to awaken from their slumber, and they
are now willing to shoulder a greater burden for their
defense]{.underline}. Most consequentially, Germany has announced it
will increase its defense spending to 2 percent of GDP and purchase 35
F-35 fighter jets, which will increase interoperability with NATO
forces. Sweden is also looking to increase its defense spending to 2
percent of GDP, while support for joining NATO has surged in the
country. Denmark has pledged to meet the 2 percent target, while Latvia,
Poland, and Romania have signaled they will boost defense spending to
exceed that target. [A depleted and exhausted Russian military and
increased European investments in their defense mean the United States
can meet its obligations to its NATO allies while **shifting resources
to Asia**]{.underline}. As such, [the Department of Defense should
continue to identify China **as the pacing challenge** given its
military might and its regional ambitions.]{.underline} [Taiwan **should
remain the pacing scenario**, as it is the most difficult one for the
United States to address and therefore if the United States gets that
right it will be well-positioned to respond to other regional
contingencies]{.underline}. [**Capabilities**]{.underline} most relevant
[**for** a **Taiwan scenario should be prioritized**]{.underline}, in
particular long-range missiles and submarines, while the United States
should continue to distribute its military presence throughout the
region. With NATO's conventional capabilities set to improve, once this
crisis passes the United States should withdraw the seven thousand
troops it sent to Europe following Russia's invasion and review its
force posture on the continent, where it currently has ninety thousand
service members based. [While Putin has upended European security,
nothing has occurred since the war in Ukraine began that reduces the
challenge that China poses for the United States]{.underline}. China's
military spending shows no sign of slowing down and is projected to
increase by over 7 percent this year. It is continuing to invest in
capabilities designed to prevent the United States from successfully
intervening on behalf of its allies and is rapidly expanding its nuclear
arsenal. China's economy is set to grow by 5.5 percent this year and it
is pulling additional economies into its orbit with the entry into force
of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and ongoing Belt and
Road Initiative investments. While [the United States]{.underline}
certainly needs to deal with the urgent threat to European security, it
[cannot lose sight of the more serious and multidimensional challenge
coming from Beijing]{.underline}. Indeed, [if the **perception takes
root** that the United States is pivoting away from Asia and **toward
Europe** this could prompt China to conclude it has a **window of
opportunity** for remaking the regional order]{.underline}.

#### 2. That war goes nuclear -- conventional and nuclear forces are intermingled.

[As China\'s power has grown]{.underline} in recent years,
[so]{.underline}, too, [has the **risk of war** with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Under]{.underline} President
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping, [China]{.underline} has
[increased]{.underline} its [**political** and **economic** pressure on
Taiwan and built military installations]{.underline} on coral [reefs in
the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, [fueling
Washington\'s fears]{.underline} that [**Chinese expansionism** will
threaten U.S. allies and influence]{.underline} in the region. [U.S.
destroyers]{.underline} have [transited the **Taiwan Strait**, to loud
protests from Beijing. American policymakers]{.underline} have
[wondered]{.underline} aloud [whether they should send an **aircraft
carrier** through the strait]{.underline} as well. [Chinese fighter jets
have intercepted U.S. aircraft in the skies above the **South China
Sea**.]{.underline} Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has brought
long-simmering economic disputes to a rolling boil. A war between the
two countries remains unlikely, but [the prospect of a **[military
confrontation]{.mark}**-resulting]{.underline}, for example,
[[from]{.mark} a [Chinese campaign **against Taiwan**-no longer]{.mark}
seems]{.underline} as **[[implausible]{.underline}]{.mark}** as it once
did. And [the [odds of]{.mark}]{.underline} such [a confrontation
[**going nuclear** are high]{.mark}er than most
policymakers]{.underline} and analysts [**think**.]{.underline} Members
of China\'s strategic community tend to dismiss such concerns. Likewise,
U.S. studies of a potential war with China often exclude nuclear weapons
from the analysis entirely, treating them as basically irrelevant to the
course of a conflict. Asked about the issue in 2015, Dennis Blair, the
former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific, estimated the
likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as \"somewhere between nil
and zero.\" This assurance is misguided. [If deployed **against China**,
the Pentagon\'s]{.underline} preferred [style of **conventional
warfare** would be a]{.underline} potential [recipe for **nuclear
escalation**]{.underline}. Since the end of the Cold War, [the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates\' [signature
[approach to war has been]{.mark} simple: punch deep into enemy
territory]{.underline} in order [to rapidly [knock
out]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[opponent\'s]{.mark} **key [military
assets]{.mark}** at **minimal cost**. But the Pentagon developed this
formula in wars against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Serbia, none of
which was a **nuclear power**. [China]{.mark}]{.underline}, by contrast,
[not only [has nuclear weapons]{.mark}; it has]{.underline} also
[**[intermingled]{.mark} them** [with]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[[conventional]{.mark} military [forces, making it difficult to **attack
one** without]{.mark} **attacking [the
other]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} This means that [a major
U.S.]{.underline} military [campaign targeting China\'s conventional
forces would]{.underline} likely also [threaten its **nuclear
arsenal**.]{.underline} Faced with such a threat, [Chinese leaders could
decide to use their nuclear weapons while]{.underline} they were
[**still able to**.]{.underline} As U.S. and Chinese leaders navigate a
relationship fraught with mutual suspicion, they must come to grips with
the fact that [a conventional war could skid into]{.underline} a
**[nuclear confrontation]{.underline}**. Although this risk is not high
in absolute terms, its consequences for the region and the world would
be devastating. [As long as the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and China]{.underline} continue to [pursue their **current grand
strategies**, the risk is likely to **endure**.]{.underline} This means
that leaders on both sides should dispense with the illusion that they
can easily fight a limited war. They should focus instead on managing or
resolving the political, economic, and military tensions that might lead
to a conflict in the first place. A NEW KIND OF THREAT There are some
reasons for optimism. For one, China has long stood out for its
nonaggressive nuclear doctrine. After its first nuclear test, in 1964,
China largely avoided the Cold War arms race, building a much smaller
and simpler nuclear arsenal than its resources would have allowed.
Chinese leaders have consistently characterized nuclear weapons as
useful only for deterring nuclear aggression and coercion. Historically,
this narrow purpose required only a handful of nuclear weapons that
could ensure Chinese retaliation in the event of an attack. To this day,
China maintains a \"no first use\" pledge, promising that it will never
be the first to use nuclear weapons. The prospect of a nuclear conflict
can also seem like a relic of the Cold War. Back then, the United States
and its allies lived in fear of a Warsaw Pact offensive rapidly
overrunning Europe. Nato stood ready to use nuclear weapons first to
stalemate such an attack. Both Washington and Moscow also consistently
worried that their nuclear forces could be taken out in a
bolt-from-the-blue nuclear strike by the other side. This mutual fear
increased the risk that one superpower might rush to launch in the
erroneous belief that it was already under attack. Initially, the danger
of unauthorized strikes also loomed large. In the 1950s, lax safety
procedures for U.S. nuclear weapons stationed on nato soil, as well as
minimal civilian oversight of U.S. military commanders, raised a serious
risk that nuclear escalation could have occurred without explicit orders
from the U.S. president. The good news is that these Cold War worries
have little bearing on U.S.-Chinese relations today. Neither country
could rapidly overrun the other\'s territory in a conventional war.
Neither seems worried about a nuclear bolt from the blue. And civilian
political control of nuclear weapons is relatively strong in both
countries. What remains, in theory, is the comforting logic of mutual
deterrence: in a war between two nuclear powers, neither side will
launch a nuclear strike for fear that its enemy will respond in kind.
[The bad news is]{.underline} that [one]{.underline} other [trigger
remains: a **conventional war** that threatens China\'s **nuclear
arsenal**. Conventional forces can threaten nuclear forces in ways that
generate **pressures to escalate**- especially when]{.underline} ever
[more capable U.S. conventional forces face adversaries
with]{.underline} relatively [small]{.underline} and fragile [nuclear
arsenals, such as China. If U.S. operations **endangered**]{.underline}
or damaged [China\'s nuclear forces, [Chinese]{.mark} leaders
[might]{.mark}]{.underline} come to [[think]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[Washington]{.mark} had aims **beyond winning** the conventional
war]{.underline}- that it might be [seeking to]{.underline} disable or
[[destroy China\'s nuclear arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark} outright,
perhaps [as a **prelude to regime change**. In the fog of war, [Beijing
might]{.mark}]{.underline} reluctantly [[conclude]{.underline}]{.mark}
that **[limited [nuclear escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**- an initial
strike small enough that it could avoid full-scale U.S. retaliation-
[[was a **viable option**]{.mark} to defend itself.]{.underline} STRAIT
SHOOTERS [The most worrisome flash point for a U.S.-Chinese war is
**Taiwan**. Beijing\'s]{.underline} long-term [objective of **reunifying
the island** with]{.underline} mainland [China is]{.underline} clearly
[in conflict with Washington\'s]{.underline} longstanding [desire to
**maintain the status quo**]{.underline} in the strait. It is not
difficult to imagine how [this might lead to war.]{.underline} For
example, [[China could]{.mark} decide]{.underline} that [the political
or military window for **regaining control** over the island was closing
and launch an [attack, using]{.mark} **air** and **naval** [forces to
blockade Taiwanese harbors]{.mark} or **bombard the
island**.]{.underline} Although U.S. law does not require Washington to
intervene in such a scenario, the Taiwan Relations Act states that the
United States will \"consider any effort to determine the future of
Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes,
a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of
grave concern to the United States.\" [[Were Washington to
**intervene**]{.mark} on Taipei\'s behalf, the world\'s]{.underline}
sole [**superpower** and its]{.underline} rising [**competitor** would
find themselves in the first **[great-power war]{.mark}** of the
twenty-first century. In the course of]{.underline} such [a war, U.S.
**conventional military operations** would]{.underline} likely
[threaten, disable, or outright eliminate]{.underline} some [Chinese
nuclear capabilities- whether doing so was Washington\'s]{.underline}
stated [objective]{.underline} or not. In fact, [if the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [engaged in the style of
warfare it]{.underline} has [practiced over]{.underline} the [**last 30
years**, this outcome would be]{.underline} all but
[**guaranteed**.]{.underline} Consider submarine warfare. [China could
use]{.underline} its [conventionally armed]{.underline} attack
[submarines to **blockade Taiwanese harbors** or **bomb the
island**,]{.underline} [or]{.underline} to [attack U.S. and allied
forces]{.underline} in the region. [If that happened, the U.S. Navy
would]{.underline} almost certainly [undertake an **antisubmarine
campaign**, which would]{.underline} likely [threaten China\'s
\"boomers,\"]{.underline} the four [nuclear armed ballistic missile
submarines]{.underline} that form its naval nuclear deterrent. [China\'s
conventionally armed and nuclear-armed submarines share the
same]{.underline} shore-based [communications system; a U.S. attack on
these **transmitters** would]{.underline} thus not only disrupt the
activities of China\'s attack submarine force but also [cut
off]{.underline} its [boomers from contact with Beijing, leaving Chinese
leaders **unsure** of]{.underline} the [fate of]{.underline} their
[naval nuclear force.]{.underline} In addition, [nuclear ballistic
missile submarines depend on attack submarines for
**protection**]{.underline}, just as lumbering bomber aircraft rely on
nimble fighter jets. [If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[started sinking Chinese attack submarines, it would be sinking
the]{.underline} very [force that protects China\'s ballistic missile
submarines, leaving the latter]{.underline} dramatically [**more
vulnerable**.]{.underline} Even [more dangerous, U.S. forces hunting
Chinese **attack submarines** could **inadvertently sink** a Chinese
boomer]{.underline} instead. After all, at least some Chinese attack
submarines might be escorting ballistic missile submarines, especially
in wartime, when China might flush its boomers from their ports and try
to send them within range of the continental United States. [Since
**correctly identifying** targets remains one of the **trickiest
challenges** of undersea warfare, [a U.S. submarine]{.mark} crew might
come within **shooting range** of a Chinese submarine]{.underline}
without being sure of its type, especially [in a crowded, noisy
environment like the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline} Platitudes about
caution are easy in peacetime. [In wartime, when Chinese attack
submarines might already have launched]{.underline} deadly [strikes, the
U.S. crew might [decide to **shoot first** and **ask questions
later.**]{.mark} Adding to China\'s]{.underline} sense of
[vulnerability, the **small size** of its nuclear armed submarine
force]{.underline} means that just [two]{.underline} such [incidents
would eliminate half of its **sea-based deterrent**.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, [any Chinese boomers that escaped this fate
would]{.underline} likely [be **cut off** from communication with
onshore commanders, left without an escort]{.underline} force, [and
unable to return to **destroyed ports**.]{.underline} If that happened,
[China would]{.underline} essentially [have no **naval nuclear
deterrent**.]{.underline} The situation is similar
[onshore]{.underline}, where [any U.S. military campaign would have to
**contend** with China\'s growing **land based** conventional ballistic
missile force.]{.underline} Much of [this force is within range of
Taiwan, ready to launch **ballistic missiles** against the island
or]{.underline} at [any allies coming to its aid.]{.underline} Once
again, [[U.S. victory]{.mark} would [hinge on]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[ability to **degrade**]{.underline}]{.mark} this [conventional
[ballistic missile]{.mark} force.]{.underline} And once again, [it would
be]{.underline} virtually [**impossible** to do so while leaving
China\'s nuclear ballistic missile force **unscathed**. [Chinese
conventional and nuclear]{.mark} ballistic [missiles]{.mark}
are]{.underline} often [[attached to the **same base**]{.mark}
**headquarters**, meaning]{.underline} that [they]{.underline} likely
[share **transportation** and **supply networks**, patrol routes, and
other]{.underline} supporting [infrastructure. It is]{.underline} also
[possible that they share]{.underline} some [**command-and-control
networks**, or that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[would be unable to **distinguish**
between]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**conventional** and
**nuclear**]{.mark} networks]{.underline} even [if]{.underline} they
were physically [**separate**. To add to the challenge]{.underline},
some of [China\'s ballistic missiles can carry either a **conventional**
or]{.underline} a [**nuclear** warhead, and the two versions
are]{.underline} virtually [**indistinguishable** to U.S.]{.underline}
aerial [surveillance. In a war, targeting]{.underline} the [conventional
variants would]{.underline} likely [mean destroying]{.underline} some
[**nuclear ones** in the process.]{.underline} Furthermore, sending
manned aircraft to attack Chinese missile launch sites and bases would
require at least partial control of the airspace over China, which in
turn would require weakening Chinese air defenses. But [degrading
China\'s coastal air defense network]{.underline} in order [to fight a
**conventional war** would]{.underline} also [leave]{.underline} much of
[its nuclear force **without protection**.]{.underline} Once China was
under attack, its leaders might come to fear that even intercontinental
ballistic missiles located deep in the country\'s interior were
vulnerable. For years, observers have pointed to the U.S. military\'s
failed attempts to locate and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles during the
1990-91 Gulf War as evidence that mobile missiles are virtually
impervious to attack. Therefore, the thinking goes, China could retain a
nuclear deterrent no matter what harm U.S. forces inflicted on its
coastal areas. Yet recent research suggests otherwise. Chinese
intercontinental ballistic missiles are larger and less mobile than the
Iraqi Scuds were, and they are harder to move without detection. The
United States is also likely to have been tracking them much more
closely in peacetime. As a result, China is unlikely to view a failed
Scud hunt in Iraq nearly 30 years ago as reassurance that its residual
nuclear force is safe today, especially during an ongoing, highintensity
conventional war. China\'s vehement criticism of a U.S. regional missile
defense system designed to guard against a potential North Korean attack
already reflects these latent fears. Beijing\'s worry is that this
system could help Washington block the handful of missiles China might
launch in the aftermath of a U.S. attack on its arsenal. That sort of
campaign might seem much more plausible in Beijing\'s eyes if a
conventional war had already begun to seriously undermine other parts of
China\'s nuclear deterrent. It does not help that China\'s real-time
awareness of the state of its forces would probably be limited, since
blinding the adversary is a standard part of the U.S. military playbook.
Put simply, [the favored U.S. strategy to ensure]{.underline} a
[conventional victory would]{.underline} likely
**[endanger]{.underline}** much of [China\'s nuclear arsenal in the
process]{.underline}, at sea and on land. [Whether the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [**actually intended** to
target]{.underline} all of [China\'s nuclear weapons would be
**incidental**. All that]{.underline} would [matter is that Chinese
leaders would consider them **threatened**.]{.underline} LESSONS FROM
THE PAST At that point, the question becomes, How will China react? Will
it practice restraint and uphold the \"no first use\" pledge once its
nuclear forces appear to be under attack? Or will it use those weapons
while it still can, gambling that limited escalation will either halt
the U.S. campaign or intimidate Washington into backing down? Chinese
writings and statements remain deliberately ambiguous on this point. It
is unclear which exact set of capabilities China considers part of its
core nuclear deterrent and which it considers less crucial. For example,
if China already recognizes that its sea based nuclear deterrent is
relatively small and weak, then losing some of its ballistic missile
submarines in a war might not prompt any radical discontinuity in its
calculus. The [danger lies in **wartime developments** that could shift
China\'s **assumptions** about U.S. **intentions**. [If Beijing
interprets]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[erosion of]{.underline}]{.mark}
its [sea- and land-based [nuclear forces as]{.mark} a **deliberate
[effort]{.mark}** [to destroy]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[nuclear
deterrent]{.mark}, or]{.underline} perhaps even [as a **prelude**
to]{.underline} a [nuclear attack, [it might see **limited nuclear
escalation** as a way to]{.mark} **force an [end]{.mark}** to the
[conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, [China could use nuclear
weapons to **instantaneously destroy**]{.underline} the [U.S. air bases
that posed the **biggest threat** to its arsenal.]{.underline} It could
also launch a nuclear strike with no direct military purpose-on an
unpopulated area or at sea-as a way to signal that the United States had
crossed a redline.

Asian nations at the White House to detail new investments in clean
energy and maritime assets, part of an effort to prevent China from
dominating the Indo-Pacific.

### U -- Long Term

#### Long-term efforts still point to China -- time and resources are zero-sum.

politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/05/18/can-united-states-focus-china-while-countering-russia/)-mikee

It is worth remembering that in the year before Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, [President]{.underline} Biden sought a "stable" relationship
with Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin. The reason he [wanted
stability]{.underline} in that relationship was [so the United States
could **shift its attention toward China**]{.underline} and the
Indo-Pacific region. Indeed, in the week before Biden's June 2021 summit
with Putin, the Group of Seven and NATO communiques focused more on
building a coordinated response to China. [The U.S. withdrawal from
Afghanistan was also keyed on a reorientation toward China]{.underline}.
Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine obviously pushed "countering
Russia" to the top of the policy queue. Putin's continual ratcheting
down of war aims from "regime decapitation and occupation of Kyiv" to
"let's take the entire Donbas region" to "let's take Luhansk oblast"
suggests that U.S. support of Ukraine has been a foreign-policy success.
The war in Ukraine raises the awkward question of whether the United
States can still reorient toward the Indo-Pacific region, however.
[Biden]{.underline} administration [officials]{.underline} sure think
so. Many of them told Bloomberg News's Peter Martin earlier this month
that they "[see]{.underline} the conflict's toll and the slew of
sanctions placed on Moscow as leaving [Russia hobbled for years to
come]{.underline}. [Combined with bolstered European defense spending,
that means the U.S. may have a freer hand to accelerate its **long-term
shift toward China,** viewed as America's biggest future
challenge]{.underline}." Such a supposition holds up in theory. Russia's
actions in Ukraine have caused a sea change in European perceptions of
Russia. [This explains Germany's increased military
spendin]{.underline}g, Sweden's and Finland's applications for NATO
membership, and even Switzerland's flirtation with more cooperation with
NATO. [A better-armed Europe and a depleted Russia should **free up U.S.
time and resources to focus on the Indo-Pacific.**]{.underline} And
China [experts]{.underline} such as Andrew Nathan [argue that the Biden
administration has the necessary strategic acumen to counter
China.]{.underline}

WASHINGTON --- President [Biden]{.underline} on Thursday [began hosting
the leaders of Southeast Asian nations]{.underline} at the White House
for a two-day visit, [delivering a message of solidarity --- and aiming
to provide a bulwark against Chinese influence in the
region]{.underline} --- even as much of his administration remains
focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The summit, which concludes on
Friday, is intended to cover an array of topics, including trade, human
rights and climate change. But it is also part of an effort by Mr.
Biden's foreign policy team to highlight one of [the president's primary
goals: assembling a united front against China]{.underline} as it
increasingly demonstrates its economic and military might around the
world. As a candidate, Mr. [Biden promised to make China a central focus
of his foreign policy]{.underline}. Instead, a senior administration
official acknowledged to reporters this week that the war in Europe had
created daily demands that had consumed the time and energy of the
president and his team. But the official, who requested anonymity to
discuss preparations for the summit, said Mr. Biden remained concerned
about, and focused on, the need to prevent China from dominating the
Indo-Pacific. [The gathering of Mr. Biden and the other world leaders in
Washington is an opportunity to demonstrate that
commitment,]{.underline} the official said. On Thursday evening, the
White House announced new investments of about \$150 million in the
region as part of a series of agreements between the United States and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. The investments by
the United States include \$40 million for clean energy projects in
Southeast Asia. A senior White House official said the administration
estimated that the money would be used to help raise or finance as much
as \$2 billion for the construction of the projects. The United States
also pledged to invest \$60 million to deploy additional maritime assets
--- led by the Coast Guard --- to the region, and to perform training
and other activities in coordination with other countries aimed at
enforcing maritime laws. And the administration said it would spend \$15
million to expand health surveillance programs in Southeast Asia and
better detect Covid-19 and other airborne diseases in the region. [The
president is also traveling to Japan and South Korea]{.underline} from
May 20 to May 24, [a trip that will focus in large part on
China.]{.underline} White House officials have not provided details
about the trip, but the president is expected to meet with fellow
leaders of the other so-called Quad countries: Australia, India and
Japan. On Thursday, the leaders from the ASEAN countries met with
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers before gathering at a
Washington hotel to discuss business opportunities with Gina Raimondo,
the commerce secretary, and executives from American industries. Mr.
Biden welcomed the leaders to the White House on Thursday evening in a
brief ceremony on the South Lawn. The group posed for a picture before
walking into the White House for dinner. On Friday, the Asian leaders
will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State
Antony J. Blinken in the morning, and then with Mr. Biden at the White
House later in the day. According to the administration official, the
group will discuss trading opportunities; transit through disputed
waterways, including the South China Sea; and other topics. One of those
topics is likely to be Myanmar, an ASEAN member, where Daw Aung San Suu
Kyi was ousted as the country's civilian leader last year when the
military staged a coup. The administration official said the United
States and countries in the region were focused on the situation and
frustrated by it. An American national security official said the United
States and the other nations agreed to leave a chair empty during the
summit for Myanmar as a way of registering their disapproval of the
actions by its military. The official also said the United States
supported the decision by ASEAN to prevent a military representative
from Myanmar from attending the summit. [The gathering is also intended
to be an opportunity for Ms. Harris to demonstrate her focus on the
region.]{.underline} She led an American delegation to Asia last summer,
using a speech in Singapore to denounce China's "unlawful claims" over
the South China Sea, which she said "undermine the rules-based order and
threaten the sovereignty of nations." The administration official said
Ms. Harris planned to use Friday's meeting with the Asian leaders to
focus on climate action, clean energy and sustainable infrastructure.

#### Pivot to Asia is high now. But it's not permanent.

**Wilkinson '22** (Tracy, covers foreign affairs from the Los Angeles
Times' Washington, D.C., bureau "Remember the 'pivot' to Asia? U.S.
wants to reassure Pacific allies it's still on," Los Angeles Times,
<https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-09/us-pivot-asia-reassure-pacific-allies>)

Like many U.S. governments before it, the [Biden]{.underline}
administration [intended a foreign policy "pivot" toward
China]{.underline} and Asia. [Instead, Washington quickly faced war
in]{.underline} Gaza, a chaotic pullout from Afghanistan and a possible
Russian invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline}. **[On
Wednesday]{.underline}**, Secretary of State Antony J.
**[Blinken]{.underline}** **[arrived]{.underline}** in Melbourne,
Australia, [for a regional tour that will see him try to reassert U.S.
influence in the Indo-Pacific against a rising China and to reassure
allies worried that their issues are being given less priority in
Washington]{.underline}. Blinken is scheduled to meet with his
Australian, Indian and Japanese counterparts, whose nations, together
with the U.S., form the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, an
on-again, off-again group established as a counterbalance to Beijing.
Speaking to reporters traveling with him, [Blinken insisted that the
Biden administration has maintained a "sustained focus" on the region
despite]{.underline} an all-consuming and urgent mission to prevent
Russia from invading [Ukraine]{.underline}. He said he was on the phone
in consultations over Ukraine during the long flight from Washington to
Australia --- the latest of some 200 engagements in recent weeks --- and
acknowledged that video-conferences and calls between Washington and
European capitals on the crisis would continue to hum in the background
of the talks in Melbourne. "Having said that, the world is a big place,
our interests are global and [you all know very well the focus that we
have put on the Asia-Pacific]{.underline} and the Indo-Pacific region,"
Blinken said. [Blinken]{.underline} and the Quad representatives [will
tackle an "increasingly broad and deep agenda]{.underline}," he said. It
will be **[dominated by]{.underline}** what most other countries in the
region see as **[Chinese aggression on]{.underline}** land and sea, as
well as other issues such as **[emerging tech]{.underline}**nologies
that can also be threatened by Beijing. Australian Foreign Minister
Marise Payne welcomed Blinken's arrival and that of the other Quad
ministers, saying that by gathering here they were "voting with their
feet in terms of the priority that they accord to \[Indo-Pacific\]
issues." Target fine lines and wrinkles while visibly firming skin with
our anti-aging treatment for men. Kiehls first all-in-one anti-aging
moisturizer for men is specifically formulated for men\'s thicker,
coarser skin. This revitalizing anti-wrinkle\... U.S. officials tacitly
acknowledge a pep talk is in order. Blinken "will demonstrate the
strength and the credibility of America's commitment to the Indo-Pacific
region," Daniel Kritenbrink, the assistant secretary of State for East
Asia and Pacific affairs, said ahead of the trip. "We intend to
demonstrate that our partnerships deliver, and they deliver practical
and real benefits to our own peoples and to the peoples of the region."
Some in Asia expected greater interaction with President Biden, who
campaigned on a shift to "strategic competition" with China as a pillar
of his foreign policy. During Biden's eight years as vice president, the
Obama administration had also promised a "pivot" to Asia as its
diplomatic focus. Instead, as crises erupted around the world, full-on
engagement was delayed. In the meantime, Chinese President Xi Jinping,
who has converted himself into leader for life, continued to claim
Beijing's sovereignty over disputed islands in the South China Sea;
pushed its massive "Belt and Road" program, which spends billions of
dollars in development money to gain influence in Europe, Africa and
Latin America; and ignored international criticism of its treatment of
the Muslim Uyghur minority, which the U.S. has called a genocide. This
week, China again took the global center stage by hosting the Winter
Olympics. The U.S. and several Western countries refused to send
government delegations, but Russian President Vladimir Putin attended,
striking a masterfully symbolic pose with Xi as the leaders of a new
post-democratic alignment. The two men issued statements lavishing
support on one another. "A much more powerful and assertive Xi
government increasingly sees U.S. geopolitical strategy and activities
in Asia through a very similar lens as \[the one through which\] Putin
has long viewed American activities in Europe," Ian Bremmer, president
of the Eurasia Group, said in an analysis of Blinken's tour. "To China,
the Quad feels a lot like NATO encroachment does to Putin." [One
potential flashpoint is China's claim on Taiwan]{.underline}, which
Beijing considers a breakaway republic much as Putin views post-Soviet
Ukraine. Despite its stated focus on the region, the [Biden
administration still seems to **be seeking its footing** in Asia
policy]{.underline}, said Michael Green, an Asia expert at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration [receives credit for designating
China as a strategic competitor]{.underline}, Green said, although it
did not follow through with policy. **[Biden "has picked up and
amplified" that decision]{.underline}**, "but has essentially no
economic strategy for Asia."

### U -- Taiwan Focus

#### US increasing its involvement with Taiwan now. 

**Hass '22** (Ryan, Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy, Center for East Asia

reading the moment is essential," June 13, 2022, Order From Chaos report

[Standing firm to support Europe does not equal diminishment of focus on
Asia]{.underline}. In the past several weeks alone, President [Biden has
hosted leaders from]{.underline} the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN[)]{.underline} in Washington for the first time. [He
traveled to Seoul and Tokyo, where he met with leaders from the
Quadrilateral Groupin]{.underline}g (Australia, India, Japan, the United
States), in addition to strengthening bilateral and trilateral relations
in Northeast Asia. [He launched the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.
Importantly for Taiwan, the Biden administration also committed to the
Initiative on 21st Century Trade,]{.underline} a new effort to break the
logjam and invigorate U.S.-Taiwan economic ties. President Biden also
signed legislation to push for Taiwan's observer status at the World
Health Assembly and [Secretary]{.underline} of State Antony [Blinken
rallied other countries to lend support for Taiwan's
participation.]{.underline} In other words, [the Biden administration is
**deepening its investments** in Asia and upping its **focus on
Taiwan**.]{.underline} [The more pressure Beijing has placed on Taiwan,
the more visible America's **support for Taiwan has
grown.**]{.underline} President [Biden's statement that the United
States would come to Taiwan's defense should be understood as an insight
into his state of mind]{.underline}, rather than a signal of a
significant policy shift. [Biden clearly feels strongly about defending
Taiwan and deterring Beijing's aggression.]{.underline} He is not an
activist who is seeking to radically alter the cross-Strait status quo,
though. His administration remains committed to deterring unilateral
changes to the status quo. This longstanding American position reflects
America's guiding focus on upholding peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait. Secretary Blinken's May 26 speech provided a clear,
well-coordinated articulation of America's interests relating to China
and Taiwan. The State Department's decision to update its website on
Taiwan policy following ​Blinken's remarks reflects the authoritative
nature of the speech. [Beijing's growing military capabilities clearly
are focusing minds in Washington]{.underline}, Taipei, and elsewhere [on
taking steps to **strengthen deterrence**]{.underline}. At the same
time, I do not detect enthusiasm in Washington or elsewhere for dramatic
shifts in government policies on Taiwan, barring an aggressive move by
Beijing that compels countries to respond. Given these dynamics,
Taiwan's best path for gaining greater international support for its
political autonomy, economic dynamism, and dignity on the world stage is
by continuing to demonstrate its steady, principled, and practical in
its approach to cross-Strait tensions. The more Taiwan does so, the more
it stands to benefit by contrast from Beijing's pressure. Taiwan also
would be well-served to seize the opportunity the Initiative on 21st
Century Trade presents. A strong coalition of countries already has made
clear the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait to
global security and prosperity. [American]{.underline}, European,
Japanese, and other countries' [interests will dictate their further
involvement in cross-Strait issues if Beijing ratchets up tensions
further.]{.underline}

#### US-Taiwan security cooperation is increasing, and there are plans to expand it further, but only with sufficient resources and dedicated effort.

MILITARY ASSISTANCE ADVISORY GROUP-TAIWAN," JANUARY 7, 2022,
https://warontherocks.com/2022/01/reestablish-the-u-s-military-assistance-advisory-group-taiwan/)

The United States has a nasty habit of firing resources at a military
problem first and asking questions about effective implementation later
--- as recently demonstrated in Iraq and Afghanistan --- but that does
not have to be the case with Taiwan. [U.S. officials are starting to get
more serious about supporting Taiwan's ability to defend itself. They
debate competing policy stances on defending Taiwan (ambiguity versus
clarity) but largely agree that "bolstering Taiwan's self-defenses is an
urgent task and an essential feature of deterrence,"]{.underline} as
recently stated by the Pentagon's top official for Asia. Experienced
U.S. officials are raising the alarm that China may attempt forceful
unification with Taiwan later this decade if deterrence continues to
erode. In the 1970s, the United States used triangular diplomacy to gain
leverage over the Soviet Union by opening relations with China and
eventually switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei, which
Washington had previously recognized as the seat of the legitimate
Chinese state and government, to Beijing. Prior to this switch in 1979,
the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group-Taiwan was the central hub
for planning, coordinating, and executing defense cooperation
initiatives. It served as the eyes, ears, and voice of the U.S. military
to the Taiwanese armed forces. It possessed the requisite staff and
planning horsepower to facilitate the large-scale military arms
transfers, training, and advising that contributed to decades of
Taiwanese military superiority over China, which has since evaporated.
BECOME A MEMBER **[U.S.-Taiwanese defense initiatives are ramping
up]{.underline}** --- to levels unseen since 1979 --- [due to legitimate
concerns about Chinese designs on the island.]{.underline} However, the
thick military organizational connective tissue that existed prior to
1979 is no longer in place to facilitate this cooperation. [Without a
military organization focused on the island, the U.S. personnel,
funding, and materiel poured into supporting Taiwan may be inefficiently
applied and generate limited return on investment]{.underline} ---
defined in terms of deterrence and lethality in conflict. To help to
deter Chinese aggression, the United States should establish a 21st
century version of this often forgotten advisory group to provide the
staff capacity, synchronization, and interagency integration required to
facilitate increasingly robust U.S.-Taiwanese military collaboration,
bolster Taiwan's defenses, and strengthen its will to fight. Despite
inevitable Chinese government counterpressure, reestablishing this
organization would probably not trigger military conflict and would be
consistent with the U.S. commitment to the One China policy, guided by
the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint Communiques, and the Six
Assurances. The Original Organization The original U.S. Military
Assistance Advisory Group-Formosa (this last word was later changed to
"Taiwan") operated from 1951 to 1979 and was instrumental in
professionalizing and modernizing Taiwan's military. During the Cold
War, the United States established military assistance advisory groups
in South Korea, Japan, South Vietnam, Europe, and the Middle East to
strengthen allies threatened by communism. The group in Taiwan was a
reincarnation of the similarly named organization that operated in China
from 1947 to 1949, until the Republic of China was defeated by the
Communists and withdrew to Taiwan. From 1951 to 1955, this group was
responsible for all U.S.-Taiwanese defense matters. In 1955, upon
ratification of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty, the U.S. Taiwan
Defense Command was established and absorbed many personnel, resources,
and responsibilities that had previously been aligned to the advisory
group. The original advisory group was established in 1951 to facilitate
large-scale arms transfers and provide military training and assistance
to deter Chinese aggression. The impetus for establishing the
organization was a U.S. military aid package worth \$300 million ---
equivalent to over \$3 billion today --- that would have overwhelmed the
small U.S. military staff in Taiwan at the time. In 1950, after North
Korea invaded South Korea, the United States shifted its policy to
support Taiwan and sent a small team to the island to prepare a
comprehensive report on Taiwan's military that was the basis for the aid
package. Once established, the advisory group was led by a major general
and initially manned with 116 U.S. servicemembers, but later grew to
over 2,000 personnel. The group established a comprehensive
American-type military school system for Taiwan's officer corps, helped
the country to implement conscription, trained and advised the military,
and oversaw military aid. The U.S. advisory group deeply understood the
Taiwan military, shaped its defense concepts, and built complementary
U.S. war plans. Lessons from previous U.S. security cooperation efforts
--- including recent failures in Iraq and Afghanistan --- suggest that
Washington's willingness to influence higher-order issues of mission,
organizational structure, and leadership is critical. The original
advisory group had offices in the same building as the Taiwan Ministry
of National Defense and U.S. staff sections were directly attached to
their Taiwanese counterparts. It embedded advisers in all major
Taiwanese training units and at the regimental level and above. All of
the group's initiatives were informed by the in-depth understanding of
Taiwan's military that was gained through this integration. The group
also influenced Taiwan's defense concepts. It translated hundreds of
U.S. military training manuals into Chinese, which shaped Taiwan's
warfighting approach. In the early 1950s, U.S. advisors helped Taiwan to
adjust its defense concept from static to mobile defense. The United
States later helped Taiwan to shift from a defensive approach to an
offensive posture, to hasten an end to the Korean War by implicitly
threatening a second front in China's southeastern underbelly. Prior to
the establishment of the Taiwan Defense Command, the advisory group
developed U.S. war plans that complemented Taiwan's own. It also planned
U.S. support to the island's wartime logistical requirements. As part of
the U.S. strategy to leverage Taiwan to help to end the Korean War, the
organization planned to help to deploy 25,000 Taiwanese military
personnel to the Korean front by the end of 1954. A reestablished
advisory group could similarly improve Taiwan's defenses today while
creating regional security benefits for the United States and its
interests. The Requirement: Control the Increasing Flow of U.S. Military
Resources to Taiwan [A new advisory group would ensure that increased
U.S. defense support provided to Taiwan is synchronized and woven into a
holistic plan that enables a credible defense of the island and helps to
reverse the erosion of cross-strait deterrence]{.underline}. China has
rapidly modernized its fleet and increased its inventory of major naval
combatants since 2005, while the U.S. fleet has aged and shed major
combat vessels. The U.S. Navy still leads --- 213 major combatants to
China's 145 --- but China is expected to reach rough parity in major
combatants and surpass the U.S. Navy in total submarines by 2030.
Further, China's navy is deployed almost entirely in the Indo-Pacific
while America's is dispersed around the globe. [There is ample
opportunity to bolster Taiwan's deterrence to help offset declines on
the U.S. side of the equation]{.underline}. This organization would help
to fulfill the legal mandate in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. The law
requires the United States to "make available to Taiwan such defense
articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to
enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capacity." The group
would ensure that the growing volume and complexity of "defense
articles" and "services" being provided to Taiwan arrive in a timely
manner and are "sufficient" to deter Chinese aggression. [Bilateral
military initiatives are reportedly **expanding**]{.underline}, in
accordance with the growing threat posed by China. [Washington
is]{.underline} reportedly [**considering** using special operators to
help Taipei to conduct irregular warfar]{.underline}e, including
establishing resistance networks and countering an amphibious landing.
This could support Taiwan's grassroots efforts to mount a
whole-of-society defense of the island, integrating civilian militias
with active-duty and reserve military personnel. [Earlier this year, the
United States and Taiwan signed a coast guard cooperation
agreement.]{.underline} Taiwan is fielding coast guard vessels capable
of carrying anti-ship missiles and envisions its coast guard as a second
navy during wartime. Taiwan is also revamping its military reserve
system. **[These are complex undertakings that would benefit from
substantial U.S. advice and assistance]{.underline}** --- especially if
they are to be realized this decade. [Congress is also pushing for more
**tangible U.S. support** to Taiwan's defensive
preparedness]{.underline}, beyond routine U.S. arms sales. The recently
introduced Taiwan Deterrence Act and Arm Taiwan Act would authorize \$2
billion and \$3 billion a year respectively in foreign military
financing for Taiwan. This could help Taipei to purchase relevant
defense articles like survivable communications systems, coastal defense
cruise missiles (including in shipping containers), small missile boats,
sea mines, loitering munition swarms, and mobile air defenses. The
Taiwan Partnership Act would establish a partnership between the U.S.
National Guard and Taiwan's military. Taiwan's plan to spend an extra
\$9 billion on domestically manufactured missiles and other capabilities
may also generate demand for increased U.S. military assistance. [Unless
it reestablishes a dedicated Taiwan-focused organization, U.S. military
**staff planning capacity**]{.underline} --- rather than U.S. policy ---
[**may soon become the limiting factor** that slows the momentum of
expanding U.S.-Taiwanese defense initiatives.]{.underline} U.S. Forces
Korea and U.S. Forces Japan headquarters are staffed with hundreds of
personnel dedicated to bilateral military cooperation and supporting the
defense of their host-nation allies. The U.S. military lacks an
equivalent organizational headquarters focused on military cooperation
with Taiwan. [The United States needs an integrated organization that is
dedicated to military deterrence and tightly networked with other
elements of national power]{.underline}. It should be flush with U.S.
interagency personnel and allies --- especially from Australia, the
United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan. To have credibility with Taiwan's
senior officers, it should be led by a U.S. general or flag officer who
is empowered to speak authoritatively on military matters on behalf of
the U.S. government. It should start with 100 to 200 personnel and grow
as additional initiatives come online or scale-up. It should also
maintain well-staffed satellite offices in U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and
Washington. The advisory group would facilitate training for Taiwanese
personnel beyond the borders of Taiwan, in the United States and
throughout the Indo-Pacific region. This [**new security cooperation**
and assistance organization should be headquartered in
Taiwan]{.underline} to enable integration with Taiwanese counterparts.
Consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, it should be affiliated with
the American Institute in Taiwan --- the non-profit organization
responsible for U.S. relations with Taiwan. This new organization would
not be a military "command" --- like the old U.S. Taiwan Defense Command
--- and placing it in Taiwan would not constitute "basing" troops on the
island. Most of its personnel should be contractors and retired military
personnel, with a smaller contingent of active-duty liaisons and
interagency personnel to fill key leadership and staff positions. These
personnel would serve in an unofficial capacity, consistent with how the
institute is currently staffed in order to maintain Washington's
adherence to the One China policy. If placing this new organization on
the island is deemed politically infeasible, it could be headquartered
elsewhere --- perhaps Palau, Guam, Japan, or Australia --- with forward
elements in Taiwan.

### U -- Resolve High Now

#### Resolve high now because Biden is prioritizing Asia above Europe

**Erlanger '21** (Steven, chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe,
based in Brussels, "The Sharp U.S. Pivot to Asia Is Throwing Europe Off
Balance," *New York Times*, 9-28-2021,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/world/europe/biden-china-europe-submarine-deal.html>)

[Until this week, the so-called "pivot to Asia" by the United States had
been more of a threat than a reality for Europe. But that changed when
the Biden administration announced a new defense alliance against
China]{.underline} that has left Europe facing an implicit question:
Which side are you on? It is a question [that European leaders
have]{.underline} studiously [sought to avoid]{.underline} since former
President Barack Obama first articulated [that]{.underline}
[America]{.underline} should "**[pivot]{.underline}**" [resources and
attention to Asia as part of its rivalry with China]{.underline}.
European leaders hoped that the relationship between the two superpowers
could remain stable and that Europe could balance its interests between
the two. Then the Trump administration sharply raised the temperature
with China with tariffs and other trade barriers. And now the Biden
administration on Wednesday announced an alliance between the United
States, Britain and Australia that would help Australia deploy
nuclear-powered submarines in the Pacific --- and, in doing so, also
tore up a \$66 billion deal for Australia to buy a French fleet of
diesel-powered subs. "Europeans want to defer the moment of truth, to
not make a choice between the two," said Thomas Gomart, director of the
French Institute of International Relations, or IFRI. "The
**[Biden]{.underline}** administration, like the Trump one, **[is
provoking]{.underline}** the moment of **[choice]{.underline}**." France
was enraged. Yet if it was a humiliation --- as well as the cancellation
of a lucrative defense deal --- it possibly did have a silver lining for
France's broader goals. President Emmanuel Macron of France has been
Europe's loudest proponent of "strategic autonomy," the idea that Europe
needs to retain a balanced approach to the United States and China. "We
must survive on our own, as others do," said Josep Borrell Fontelles,
the European Union's foreign policy chief, echoing the French line. The
French embarrassment --- the Americans also announced the submarine deal
with little if any warning --- came after the disastrous fall of
Afghanistan. European allies were furious with the Biden administration,
blaming the Americans for acting with little or no consultation and
feeding Mr. Macron's argument that the United States is no longer an
entirely reliable security partner. "The submarines and Afghanistan, it
reinforces the French narrative that you can't trust the Americans,"
said Ulrich Speck of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. Emmanuel
Macron's Second Term as President of France With the reelection of
Emmanuel Macron, French voters favored his promise of stability over the
temptation of an extremist lurch. Cabinet: President Macron's new
government combines continuity with change, as newcomers at the foreign
and education ministries join first-term veterans. New Prime Minister:
Élisabeth Borne, the minister of labor who previously was in charge of
the environment, will be the second woman to hold the post in France.
Overcoming Tragedy: Ms. Borne's father, a World War II resistance member
and a Holocaust survivor, killed himself when she was 11, an experience
she has rarely discussed in public. Rape Allegations: Two women have
accused Damien Abad, the newly appointed minister for solidarity and for
disabled people, of raping them. Mr. Abad has denied the allegations.
But whether France will succeed in turning this bilateral defeat into a
way to promote strategic autonomy is doubtful, analysts suggest. "Many
Europeans will see this as a transparent way for the French to leverage
their own interests," said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, the
London-based research institution. Even so, there seems little doubt
that Europe's balancing act is becoming trickier to maintain. "Europe
needs to think hard about where it sits and what it does," said Rosa
Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe. A Europe that spends more on
defense is to be desired, but it also needs allies --- including Britain
and the United States, she said. And a Europe that does more to build
its own security capacity "is the best way to be listened to more by its
partners," she added. The new alliance, known as AUKUS, is an effort to
integrate Australia and Britain into the broader American effort to
create a security deterrent to China. For Australia, which has seen its
once-strong relations with Beijing deteriorate, America and Britain
provide a much stouter deterrent to China in the Indo-Pacific, analysts
agree, than could the deal with France. "[It's **sending a very big
signal to Beijing**, which is useful for the U.S]{.underline}., but
especially useful to Australia," said Ian Lesser, acting director of the
German Marshall Fund and head of its Brussels office. "[And the weight
of that signal is important]{.underline} because of who the partners
are."

### AT: Ukraine

#### Biden is reducing involvement in Ukraine-- China is the top-priority now

**Ferguson '22** (Niall Ferguson is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. The
Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford
University, "Dust Off That Dirty Word Detente and Engage With China,"

To his credit, [Biden **dialed back his**]{.underline} administration's
**[goals]{.underline}** in a measured op-ed for the New York Times on
May 31. "We do not seek a war between NATO and Russia. ... \[T\]he
United States will not try to bring about \[Putin's\] ouster in Moscow.
So long as the United States or our allies are not attacked, [we will
not be directly engaged in this conflict.]{.underline} We are not
encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. [We do not
want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia.]{.underline}"
But the reality is that the administration has become the arsenal of
Ukraine's democracy, not the broker of a peace that it is leaving to
Ukraine to define. [Three of Europe's most important
leaders]{.underline} --- French President Emmanuel Macron, German
Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi ---
[are]{.underline} distinctly [uneasy]{.underline} about this. [They
would much prefer to see an imminent ceasefire and the start of peace
negotiations]{.underline}. But to speak of compromise in the current
febrile atmosphere of Ukrainophilia is to invite charges of appeasement.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reacted angrily to Kissinger's
argument for a peace based on the status quo ante. "I get the sense that
instead of the year 2022," Zelenskiy snapped, "Mr. Kissinger has 1938 on
his calendar." Yet Zelenskiy himself has said repeatedly --- most
recently in an interview on May 21 --- that he would regard as "victory"
a return to the territorial position on Feb. 23, which was what
Kissinger plainly meant by the status quo ante. That would mean Ukraine
taking back Kherson and the ravaged city of Mariupol. It would mean
pushing Russia out of its "land bridge" from Crimea to Russia. And it
would mean completely reversing all the gains the Russians have made in
the eastern Donbas region. Zelenskiy knows, and so should we, what a
daunting task that represents. In a speech last week, he acknowledged
that Russia has seized around a fifth of Ukraine's territory. In an
interview with Newsmax, he admitted that Ukraine was losing "60 to 100
soldiers per day as killed in action and something around 500 people as
wounded in action." Even with an open-ended commitment from the US to
supply them with weapons, do the Ukrainians have the trained manpower to
drive Russia out of all the territory it has occupied since Feb. 24? And
if this brutal war continues through the summer, and is still being
fought as the year wanes and the temperatures begin to fall in Europe,
what then? Vladimir Putin is surely counting on the usual divisions
within the Western alliance and within American politics to resurface
sooner or later. [The most remarkable thing about the foreign policy of
the Biden administration is that **helping Ukraine defeat Russia is not
even its top priority**]{.underline}. "Even as President Putin's war
continues," declared Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a speech at
George Washington University on May 26, "[we will remain focused on the
most serious long-term challenge to the international order --- and
that's posed by the People's Republic of China." Blinken's speech repays
close study. About one-tenth of it was conciliatory]{.underline}. "We
are not looking for conflict or a new Cold War," he declared. "We do not
seek to transform China's political system. ... We will engage
constructively with China wherever we can." [But the rest
was]{.underline} as [**hawkish**]{.underline} a speech **[on
China]{.underline}** as the one delivered by then Vice President Mike
Pence in October 2018, which for me was the moment Cold War II got going
in earnest. In Blinken's words: Under President Xi, the ruling Chinese
Communist Party has become more repressive at home and more aggressive
abroad. We see that in how Beijing has perfected mass surveillance
within China and exported that technology to more than 80 countries; how
its advancing unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea,
undermining peace and security, freedom of navigation, and commerce; how
it's circumventing or breaking trade rules ... and how it purports to
champion sovereignty and territorial integrity while standing with
governments that brazenly violate them. Blinken spelled out how [the US
intends to "shape the strategic environment around
Beijing]{.underline}," citing the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework
for Prosperity, announced by Biden on his recent Asia tour, and the Quad
of the US, Australia, India and Japan, with its new Indo-Pacific
Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, not forgetting AUKUS, the US
deal on nuclear submarines with Australia and the UK. But the most
startling lines in Blinken's speech were the ones on "the genocide and
crimes against humanity happening in the Xinjiang region"; on US support
for "Tibet, where the authorities continue to wage a brutal campaign
against Tibetans and their culture, language, and religious traditions";
on Hong Kong, "where the Chinese Communist Party has imposed harsh
anti-democratic measures under the guise of national security"; on
"Beijing's aggressive and unlawful activities in the South and East
China Seas"; and --- the coup de grace from a Chinese vantage point ---
on "Beijing's growing coercion" and "increasingly provocative rhetoric
and activity" toward Taiwan. The response of the Chinese Foreign
Ministry to this confrontational speech was, I thought, surprisingly
restrained. [Taiwan is,]{.underline} of course, [the key
issue.]{.underline} As if to confirm Xi Jinping's darkest suspicions,
Biden went off script again at a press conference in Tokyo with Japanese
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on May 23. A reporter asked if the United
States would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack. "Yes," the
president answered. "That's the commitment we made. We agree with a
one-China policy. We\'ve signed on to it and all the intended agreements
made from there. But the idea that, that it (Taiwan) can be taken by
force, just taken by force, is just not, is just not appropriate."
Almost immediately, US officials, led by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin,
walked this latest gaffe back. But when is a gaffe not a gaffe? When the
president of the United States says it three times. By my count, that is
the number of occasions Biden has pledged to come to Taiwan's defense
since August last year. What are the practical implications of ditching
the half-century-old policy of "strategic ambiguity" on Taiwan, which
dates to Kissinger's compromise with Zhou Enlai in 1972? In his book
"The Strategy of Denial: American Defense in an Age of Great Power
Conflict," Elbridge Colby argues that the US can and must prioritize the
defense of Taiwan. Colby was deputy assistant secretary of defense for
strategy and force development under Donald Trump. His book has been a
hit with China hawks precisely because it gets specific about how the US
could cope with a Chinese attempt to seize Taiwan. "Defending forces
operating from a distributed, resilient force posture and across all the
war-fighting domains," Colby writes, "might use a variety of methods to
blunt the Chinese invasion in the air and seas surrounding Taiwan." The
US and its allies might "seek to disable or destroy Chinese transport
ships and aircraft before they left Chinese ports or airstrips. The
defenders might also try to obstruct key ports; neutralize key elements
of Chinese command and control ... And once Chinese forces entered the
Strait, US and defending forces could use a variety of methods to
disable or destroy Chinese transport ships and aircraft." ["There's a
very real chance of a major war with China in the coming years," Colby
tweeted last month]{.underline}. ["Everyone with influence should be
asking themselves: Did I do \*everything\* I could to deter
it?]{.underline} And make it less costly for Americans if it does
happen? ... China has the will, the way, and increasingly a sense of
urgency to take us on over stakes that are genuinely decisive for us
(and the world, for that matter)."

#### Aid to Ukraine doesn't trigger perception of abandonment in Asia, yet. But, further moves to solidify US presence in Europe would

Institute and a former staff member on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, "Biden Must Do Better Than Obama on Ukraine," Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/01/27/biden-obama-russia-ukraine-military-strategy-nato/>)

The Winter Olympics are just around the corner. Russian President
Vladimir Putin has Ukraine on his mind. In Washington, the [Pentagon is
preparing a new defense strategy]{.underline} that looks beyond the
Middle East [to focus on the Pacific and China. The White House,
meanwhile, is concerned about costs and wants to rein in military
spending]{.underline}. Sound familiar? Well, this is exactly what the
world looked like once before---in 2014. When the Obama administration's
defense strategy was released in March 2014, the document was obsolete
the day it was published. It did not mention Ukraine, even though
Putin's little green men had already seized Crimea. It did not mention
the Islamic State by name, though the group's fighters had already
captured Fallujah. With the defense budget under spending caps and the
threat of sequestration, the Pentagon had to spend tens of billions of
dollars in contingency funds to rebuild European deterrence following
Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine and to defeat the Islamic
State in the Middle East. Meanwhile, the Obama administration's attempt
to pivot to Asia stalled, and the U.S. military edge over China
continued to shrink. As history threatens to repeat itself, U.S.
President Joe Biden---who served under Barack Obama as vice
president---looks perilously close to following in his predecessor's
footsteps. [Biden faces the same question as in 2014: How can the United
States stay focused on China while dealing with]{.underline} the crisis
in [Ukraine]{.underline}? Just as it was then, prioritizing the
Indo-Pacific and countering China will not be strategically effective or
politically sustainable if it is premised on sacrificing the commitment
to credible NATO deterrence and defense. But [given **finite
resources**, the United States **cannot** confront China, the most
powerful adversary it has ever faced, without **substantially changing**
how it achieves strategic ends in
Europe]{.underline}---[especially]{.underline} when it comes to
**[military power]{.underline}**. That's not just an urgent strategic
question to answer now, as Washington decides how to deal with Russia's
threatened invasion of Ukraine. It also needs to be at the core of the
Pentagon's strategy that is set to be published as early as March.
**[The administration must resist calls]{.underline}** for a return to a
strategy designed **[to win on two fronts simultaneously]{.underline}**
or in sequence. [**Right now,** the United States can do a lot to
support Ukraine]{.underline}, impose costs on Russia,
**[and]{.underline}** [assure NATO allies without compromising its
strategy to counter China]{.underline}. At the top of the list are
accelerated deliveries of defensive military equipment to
Ukraine---especially anti-armor, anti-ship, and air defense
capabilities---as well as intelligence support and humanitarian
assistance. If Russia does invade, Biden should get much more serious
about sanctions than Obama was in 2014. Washington should target the
wealth of Putin's cronies in Western financial hubs, terminate Russian
access to the SWIFT global payment system, prohibit transactions in
Russian sovereign debt, sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and cut off
access to U.S. technology critical for industries favored by Putin,
including defense. The Trump administration's technology sanctions that
have seriously hobbled the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei are
an excellent precedent for this. The United States should also join NATO
efforts to reinforce its eastern flank, including contributing U.S.
troops to support the temporary activation and deployment of NATO's
Response Force. For this eventuality, the Biden administration has
placed up to 8,500 U.S. military personnel on alert.
**[But]{.underline}** even as Washington reacts to Moscow's threats to
overturn the European security order, **[China]{.underline}** and the
Indo-Pacific **[must remain the primary focus of the United States'
strategic calculus]{.underline}**. To that end, the administration
should ensure sanctions do not inflict collateral damage on Indo-Pacific
allies and partners. In particular, ensnaring India in Russia-focused
sanctions for New Delhi's planned purchase of the Russian S-400 air and
missile defense system would be a mistake. Sanctions won't stop the
S-400 deal, but they would play into the narrative pushed by Moscow and
Beijing that Washington is not a trustworthy partner for New Delhi. [To
keep its focus squarely on the Indo-Pacific, the United States must
exercise **restraint** in what]{.underline} forces **[it sends
to]{.underline}** reinforce **[NATO]{.underline}** should Putin invade
Ukraine, and from where. Forces should not be taken from the Pacific.
They should be relocated within Europe, from the United States, or from
lower-priority theaters. For example, air and ground forces stationed in
the Middle East could be moved to southeastern Europe to bolster NATO
while remaining close enough to respond to any contingency. Deployment
of an additional U.S. Army brigade combat team---of limited utility
vis-à-vis China---may be sensible. But the Pentagon should avoid new,
long-term deployments of assets in low supply, such as missile defense
systems and advanced platforms for intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance. The Biden administration should also remember that
allies provide the bricks, while the United States provides the mortar.
[NATO allies should contribute the bulk of any new forces]{.underline}
deployed to guard the alliance's eastern flank while the United States
provides key military enablers such as command and control, logistics,
and combat medicine. The good news is that allies are in fact stepping
up: Denmark, France, Spain, and the Netherlands have all recently
announced or proposed reinforcements of ships, fighter aircraft, and
ground forces. Even as it responds to the crisis in Europe, Washington
can take parallel steps to bolster deterrence in the Pacific---so that
the current attention on Europe is not interpreted as a sign of weakness
and distraction, as it was in 2014. For example, the Biden
administration could announce plans to station a fifth and eventual
sixth attack submarine in Guam. It could also back legislation on
Capitol Hill to increase security assistance to Taiwan. Taking these
steps during a crisis in Europe would send a powerful signal to Beijing
and allied capitals that the United States' priority on the Pacific
perseveres. The **[Biden]{.underline}**
administration**['s]{.underline}** new defense [strategy needs to
confront the question of overstretch head-on. Given **limited
resources** and the strength of the United States'
adversaries---**especially China**---the U.S. ability to prevail in a
great-power conflict cannot be taken for granted]{.underline}. [That's
why the administration must resist calls for a return to a strategy
designed to win on two fronts simultaneously]{.underline} or in
sequence. [Such a force sizing is simply not realistic and **would
dilute the U.S. military's focus on the Indo-Pacific as its priority
theater**, China as its pacing threat, and Taiwan as **its pressing
scenario**]{.underline}. Critically, [staying on track in the Pacific
requires matching any new military commitments in
Europe]{.underline}---even temporary ones---[with new
resources]{.underline}. [The United States **must not ask its military
to do more with less** or pretend that China]{.underline} and Russia
[can be deterred]{.underline} and confronted [on the cheap]{.underline}.
Now is not the time to cut defense spending as the Biden administration
has proposed. Not when the U.S. military edge relative to China has so
dangerously eroded. Not when inflation, aging platforms, rising
personnel costs, and the failure to pass a budget on time are sapping
the Pentagon's buying power. The Biden administration and the U.S.
Congress must provide the military with the sufficient, timely, and
predictable funding demanded in these perilous times, and which U.S.
service members deserve.

#### Biden is shifting from Ukraine to focus resources on China now

The past couple of months marked a rallying moment for the geopolitical
West. [The Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a sweeping, united
response from Europe and its allies across the Atlantic]{.underline}. It
led to far-reaching, coordinated sanctions on Moscow. [It provoked a
new, steely approach from many Europeans to diplomatically and
militarily confront Russia. And it spurred the imminent expansion of
NATO]{.underline}, an alliance cast by critics not long ago as an
obsolete relic of the Cold War. [The United States and its E.U. partners
are flooding Ukraine with weaponry and aid]{.underline}. By some
accounts, the Biden administration alone has mustered more funding for
Ukraine in recent weeks than it is committing in the next fiscal year
for fighting the planetary peril of climate change. [Yet]{.underline} in
Washington, **[there remains a large elephant in the room:
China.]{.underline}** New battles with the Kremlin have energized the
doyens of the city's foreign policy establishment, many of whom cut
their teeth during the Cold War. But the [Biden]{.underline}
administration is trying to show that it **[hasn't lost sight of its key
21st century "strategic competitor."]{.underline}** And it recognizes
that its contest with China requires closer partnerships well outside
Europe. **[A new push started this week]{.underline}**. On Thursday
evening, the White House hosted a dinner with eight leaders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as a part of a major
U.S.-led summit with the regional bloc. On Friday, the Southeast Asian
delegations are slated to continue discussions at the State Department
before a plenary session with President Biden. Next week, [Biden will
embark on a five-day trip to South Korea and Japan, culminating in
another meeting of the "Quad" grouping with Australia, Japan and
India]{.underline}. U.S. officials recognize that a decade of talk about
a strategic "pivot" to Asia has yet to yield concrete results. "Several
administrations in succession in the United States have tried ... to
launch more fundamental efforts, policies, frameworks in Asia, East
Asia, Indo-Pacific, and found themselves stymied or misdirected or
directed toward other pursuits," said Kurt Campbell, the White House's
lead official on Indo-Pacific policy, in a speech this week at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "And that
has been something that I think all of us are deeply aware of in the
formulation and execution of policy." The [Biden]{.underline}
administration aims to show that its heavy [involvement in]{.underline}
the **[Ukraine]{.underline}** war **[is not a distraction from its
priorities to the East]{.underline}**. But it is climbing an uphill road
with ASEAN countries, where many officials lament a lack of American
engagement, especially during the years of the Trump administration.

In the long run, **[the United States can't contain both Russia and
China]{.underline}**. Europe's resolute opposition to Putin's war
provides an opening for a strategic shift. When a great power takes a
gamble, the world shakes. By ordering an attack on Ukraine, Russian
President Vladimir Putin has unleashed a chain of reactions whose
endpoint no one can yet foresee. Already apparent, however, is one
consequence for the United States. Overstretched to begin with, America
has just seen its strategic burden increase. Just as suddenly, however,
a new solution is coming into view: Europe is ready to take on greater
military duties. Before the war, many Americans, including some
political leaders, had determined to be more realistic about their
country's strategic ambitions in an increasingly competitive world.
Sensibly, President Biden had sought to stabilize relations with Russia
and reduce U.S. war-making in the greater Middle East while turning
attention and resources toward managing a rising China. But Putin's
Russia has refused to be sidelined. By invading Ukraine, it has caused
NATO's eastern flank, with four countries bordering Russian territory,
to demand reinforcements --- and the United States has risen to the
task. Biden has sent 14,000 American troops to Europe since the crisis
began, bringing the total to 100,000. [Providing **temporary**
reinforcements is the right decision today]{.underline} in the face of
Russia's bald aggression. [But the United States **should resist the
inclination** to revive its role as the military protector of
Europe]{.underline}, especially [since Europe is awakening to its
responsibilities]{.underline}. Britain is sending troops to the Baltic
states and Poland. France is pushing "strategic autonomy" for the
European Union. And days after halting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline
supplying natural gas from Russia, Germany reversed a long-standing ban
on providing military assistance and sent weapons to Ukraine. Germany
also vowed to spend more than 2 percent of its economy on defense,
finally committing to meet NATO's target. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz
declared his country, and Europe, to have reached a "historic turning
point." Both Americans and Europeans would benefit if Scholz's words
prove true. [In the coming years, European states should move to take
the lead in their collective defense, and the United States should do
everything possible to encourage them.]{.underline} To stake the defense
of Europe on the United States, over the next decade and beyond, would
be to answer Putin's rash gamble with a slow-moving gamble of our own.
It might seem as though the United States will remain able and willing
to protect all of NATO's 28 European countries far into the future.
After all, America has orchestrated Europe's defense for the past eight
decades. Yet it did so under two markedly different conditions. During
World War II and the Cold War, the United States sought to stop
totalitarian powers from conquering the region. An Axis or Soviet
takeover of Europe would have closed off the entire continent to
liberal, American-style interaction and influence, and put the Western
Hemisphere on the defensive. After the Cold War, however, as the Soviet
threat collapsed, the United States recommitted to Europe not because
the stakes were high but arguably because they were low. Threats were so
negligible that it seemed U.S. leadership could keep things that way
through modest exertion --- and spread democracy to boot. Expanding NATO
eastward, American officials convinced themselves that what had been a
military alliance was more comparable to a political club, one that need
not become an adversary of Russia. Russia's assault on Ukraine ends that
chapter and begins a new one. The prospect of further Russian aggression
in Eastern Europe cannot be dismissed as negligible, as it was in the
1990s or 2000s. At the same time, Russia poses far less a threat to
overrun Europe and threaten American security or prosperity than the
Soviet Union did. After all, the Russian economy is roughly one-fifth
the size of that of the European Union, and that was before the severe
sanctions of the past week. Although Russia has built a formidable
military, one that enables it to launch wars like that in Ukraine,
NATO's European members collectively outspend Russia on defense. During
the Cold War, by contrast, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact boasted land
forces superior in number to those of NATO (including the U.S. share),
and the gap between its economic output and that of Western Europe was
several times smaller than Russia's shortfall today. In the security
environment now emerging, with Russia menacing Eastern Europe, the
United States is set to face major costs and the ultimate risk:
great-power war between nuclear peers. Yet [the threat Russia poses
remains one that **Europeans could handle themselves**, with America
acting as a supporter **rather than the leader**]{.underline}. The
United States remains a superpower. Why shouldn't it be the main
counterweight in Europe to Moscow? [There are]{.underline} two [reasons
both the United States and Europe would be better off if it declined
this role]{.underline}. One lies in [Beijing]{.underline}, and the other
in Washington. [The United States has already identified China as its
primary rival,]{.underline} embarking on "strategic competition" with
the world's number-two power. [Taking on China and Russia at once would
be **unwise and likely impossible**]{.underline}. True, the Pentagon has
previously planned to fight two wars at once, but those wars were
envisioned as "regional" conflicts against small states like Iran, Iraq
or North Korea. In practice, the United States had difficulty
prosecuting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan simultaneously. [China and
Russia represent challenges of a far greater magnitude]{.underline},
which explains why the Pentagon abandoned its two-war standard in 2018,
even as its budget has grown. [If the United States **doubles down** on
European security while leading the charge in Asia, it may either **fall
short in both places** or default on its commitments in Europe just when
they come due]{.underline}. America's domestic divisions must also be
taken seriously. The Republican front-runner for 2024, former president
Donald Trump, initially called Putin's invasion of Ukraine a "genius"
move. How reliable, then, is America's commitment to Europe? Even in
better times, it would remain uncertain whether a U.S. president would
place the American people in peril for the sake of repelling a Russian
attack in Eastern Europe --- for example, potentially trading a nuclear
attack on Boston to protect the Estonian capital of Tallinn. Under
present circumstances, it would be folly for Europe to trust its fate to
doubtful promises, and wise for the Biden administration to Trump-proof
American alliances. [Today, even smaller European countries like
Belgium, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are ferrying arms to
Ukraine]{.underline}, while perpetually neutral Switzerland is freezing
Russian assets. Yet proclamations of a "new Europe" are premature. [If
the United States does not **galvanize and incentivize its allies to
step up**, they are unlikely to make the profound changes needed to
build a European security architecture that can last.]{.underline} In
the coming months, the administration could formulate a multiyear but
time-limited plan to transition to a European defense led by Europe.
Such a plan would build on the work of the British-Baltics-Polish
coalition that reinforced Eastern Europe before the war, but it must
also involve the major Continental powers of Germany and France, whose
participation is key to forging a durable order. By publicizing the
plan, and doing so while passions remain high, the United States and its
allies could create a credible commitment on both sides of the Atlantic.
Europe would have to act quickly to redress its [strategic deficits
relative to Russia, which are real but too often
exaggerated.]{.underline} The European members of NATO already possess
around two dozen armored and mechanized brigades, enough to make a
Russian offensive difficult in the early stages and allow Europe to
prevail through its overwhelming economic and demographic advantages.
The most urgent task is to improve the readiness and sustainability of
European forces. German determination and funding will go a long way
toward that end. In particular, Europe must develop certain critical
capabilities, such as surface-to-air missile batteries, combat-support
assets, and air-refueling systems --- all essential for high-end
operations, and at present possessed mostly by the United States. During
the transitional period, U.S. military would continue to provide
command-and-control functions and logistics support so as not leave an
opportunity for Moscow to exploit. The Biden administration would,
however, begin to shift command of NATO to European leadership, and
deepen its support for E.U. defense efforts, which previous
administrations sought to suppress. As European forces steps up, the
United States could bring most of its personnel home, with some air and
naval forces remaining. [Europe would also need to grow its
defense-industrial base, both to develop cutting-edge technologies and
to create enduring political support for higher spending.]{.underline}
Since 2017, the E.U. has implemented promising new measures to increase
and coordinate investments in defense. If the E.U. could borrow 750
billion euros to fund pandemic recovery, it could borrow billions more
to finance new defense capabilities. [Here, as elsewhere, the United
States would have to take concerned action just to keep from getting in
its allies' way]{.underline}. [To allow European industry to grow, the
White House]{.underline} and Congress **[ought to be less aggressive in
facilitating sales of U.S.-made military equipment]{.underline}**. The
profits of domestic contractors should yield to the vital defense needs
of the United States and Europe. In another era, the prospect of letting
Europeans lead Europe's defense would have caused an outcry in some
quarters of Washington. Even today, it will cause controversy. But
political reality suggests it is necessary. [Biden has a
once-in-a-generation chance to realign America's strategic priorities
while demonstrably strengthening Europe's defenses]{.underline}. By
doing so, he could inspire bipartisan unity. He could forge a path that
his successors could follow, regardless of party or personality, by
building a Europe-led, U.S.-supported order to preserve the next decades
of peace and prosperity across the Atlantic.

### L -- Budget Resources

#### Security cooperation with NATO trades off with commitments to Asian allies

**Bowne '18** (Andrew, Major, Judge Advocate in the US Air Force,
"Defending The New Fulda Gap: Deterring Russian Aggression Against The
Baltic States Through Fiscal Legislation," *Military Law Review*,
226.3)//BB

Although it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the precise
amount of expenditures the United States commits directly to NATO,
estimates by RAND Corporation and the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) place the total costs of keeping U.S.
forces in key industrial nations at less than \$10 billion a year, or
less than two percent of the total defense budget.58 While the United
States increased defense spending by over eighty percent since 2001,
"virtually none of that increase was generated by NATO commitments."59
When compared to the defense posture the United States fielded in Europe
during the Cold War, [the resources currently obligated to defending
Europe are remarkably low.]{.underline} In 1990, approximately fifteen
percent of the total worldwide active strength was stationed in Europe,
whereas only three percent of a significantly smaller total active force
remains in Europe in 2017.60 Thus, despite the political rhetoric and
fact that the United States spends more on defense than all other NATO
members combined, it is clear [the]{.underline} actual [contribution to
NATO is a relatively small portion of the overall U.S. defense budget.
It is critical to understand the parameters of the United States'
contribution to NATO because the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has **finite resources**, and, since enactment
of the Budget Control Act]{.underline} (BCA) of 2011, [**legally binding
caps** on funding]{.underline}.61 [Every dollar spent towards the
objectives of NATO is]{.underline}, in theory, [**a dollar less**
going]{.underline} to fight the Islamic State or **[towards the Pacific
pivot]{.underline}**. However, the misunderstanding of the true costs of
the United States' role in NATO could have dangerous consequences. If
the U.S. budgets and plans for NATO operations based on the false
premise that it already spends too much and its partners do not
contribute enough, U.S. leadership will likely make decisions that
adversely affect its own national security interests.

### L -- Focus 

#### The plan distracts US from deterring China.

[There has been a lot of global media frenzy about Taiwan's security in
recent weeks]{.underline}. Experts have debated what lessons China might
be drawing from Russia's military setbacks in Ukraine. Pundits grew
excited when President Joe Biden declared in Tokyo that the United
States would intervene militarily if Taiwan was attacked. Yet, below
this exuberant froth, policy discussions in the United States, Asia, and
Europe have remained relatively steady. I have had an opportunity to
interact with [senior officials and diplomats from all three of these
regions]{.underline} in recent weeks, as well as a range of business
executives. They all [have unanimously said **they are paying heightened
attention to developments in the Taiwan Strait**]{.underline} and
thinking methodically through how best to adjust to shifting
circumstances. Contrary to what daily newspaper headlines would suggest,
though, they are not considering radical shifts in approach[. They are
responding]{.underline} to evolving circumstances by doing the
equivalent of adjusting a light dimmer rather than flipping a light
switch​. [Some American experts fear that **Ukraine will distract the
U.S**. from preparing for the principal arena of potential conflict ---
Asia.]{.underline} They argued early in Russia's invasion of Ukraine
that [the United States should not allow itself to get **bogged down in
a European** conflict that did not implicate America's vital
interests.]{.underline} They suggested instead that [the United States
should accelerate its transition in focus and military resources to the
Indo-Pacific and strengthen America's deterrent posture against
China]{.underline}.

#### US leadership in Europe undermines effective deterrence of China

**Mearsheimer '22** (John, Professor of Political Science at U Chicago,
"Why John Mearsheimer Blames the U.S. for the Crisis in Ukraine," The

I'm talking about the raw-power potential of Russia---the amount of
economic might it has. Military might is built on economic might. You
need an economic foundation to build a really powerful military. To go
out and conquer countries like Ukraine and the Baltic states and to
re-create the former Soviet Union or re-create the former Soviet Empire
in Eastern Europe would require a massive army, and that would require
an economic foundation that contemporary Russia does not come close to
having. [There is **no reason** to fear that Russia is going to be a
regional **hegemon**]{.underline}y [in Europe]{.underline}. [Russia is
not a serious threat to the United States. We do face a serious threat
in the international system. We face a peer competitor. **And that's
China**]{.underline}. Our policy in [Eastern Europe is **undermining our
ability** to deal with the most dangerous threat that we face
today]{.underline}. What do you think our policy should be in Ukraine
right now, and what do you worry that we're doing that's going to
undermine our **[China]{.underline}** policy? [We should be **pivoting
out** of Europe to deal with China in a **laser-like fashion, number
one**]{.underline}. And, number two, we should be working overtime to
create friendly relations with the Russians. The Russians are part of
our balancing coalition against China. If you live in a world where
there are three great powers---China, Russia, and the United
States---and one of those great powers, **[China, is a peer
competitor]{.underline}**, what you want to do if you're the United
States is have Russia on your side of the ledger. Instead, what we have
done with our foolish policies in Eastern Europe is drive the Russians
into the arms of the Chinese. This is a violation of Balance of Power
Politics 101.

### L -- Cyber

#### The plan would demand significant resources and attention -- guarantees a trade-off.

Effective **[cyber threat information sharing requires planning,
long-term investment, and sustained commitment]{.underline}**. For
example, technical cyber threat information sharing is not merely a
matter of adopting a technical standard and installing software. [It
takes engineering and analytic time on an ongoing basis as well as
maintenance of the technology and processes]{.underline}. Similarly,
[consuming cyber security best practices is not a one-time endeavour;
organisations must incorporate regular review and implementation into
their business processes]{.underline}. [Absent a **long-term
commitment** from organizational leadership]{.underline}, sharing
usually withers after an initial burst of enthusiasm. Cyber security
should take on the same status as other business enablers, such as
accounting, legal affairs, and communications; like these areas, [cyber
security should be a function that all organisations budget for and
sustain over the long-term]{.underline}. Cyber threat information
sharing has bedevilled the cyber security community for at least two
decades. Faulty assumptions have prevented this fundamentally sound
concept from achieving its potential. But while information sharing is a
tough problem, it is not an insoluble one. If the cyber security
community adopts different underlying assumptions for information
sharing then the volume, quality, and utility of the exchanged
information can increase. In turn, more effective, relevant information
sharing will enable defenders to better understand and anticipate
adversaries, develop mechanisms to disrupt adversary activities more
strategically, and raise the level of cyber security across the digital
ecosystem. Under these circumstances, cyber threat information sharing
can finally live up to its promise to enable better cyber security for
everyone. [For NATO, updating programmes to reflect these revised
information sharing assumptions would require **significant changes** to
current operation]{.underline}s. [First, overcoming the technical,
economic, legal, and cultural barriers to sharing relevant, actionable
information across member countries and economic sectors **will require
sustained attention, prioritisation, and funding from NATO's senior
leadership**]{.underline}. Absent such attention, the barriers will
likely prove insurmountable. Second, NATO should build on its existing
MISP \[Malware Information Sharing Platform\] use to create a more
comprehensive system of information sharing that broadens the types of
information shared and widens the number of recipients. Third, NATO
should consider how to better leverage industry for technical
information, while enriching that information with government-derived
information about context, attribution, and intent. If NATO shifted its
approach to information sharing as suggested, the Alliance would have
the opportunity to assume a leadership position in this area. If not,
NATO will continue to struggle to make information sharing live up to
its promise.

#### NATO cyber-defense is enormously expensive

**Sanger '16** (David, White House and national security correspondent,
and a senior writer @ NYT, "As Russian Hackers Probe, NATO Has No Clear
Cyberwar Strategy," *New York Times*,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/world/europe/nato-russia-cyberwarfare.html)//BB>

[At United States Cyber Command]{.underline}, which has [expanded
rapidly]{.underline} since the United States carried out cyberattacks
against Iran in 2010, Russia's networks are a regular target of
surveillance. By next year, Cyber Command will have more than 130 teams
fully in operation around the world, integrated into Army, Navy, Marine
and Air Force units, in addition to teams that work alongside the
National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md. It has built up a vast early
warning network, placing tens of thousands of "implants" --- sensors
that can also be used to insert malware --- into networks around the
world. [But NATO is **only beginning** to explore what it delicately
calls "active defense,"]{.underline} and says it is not focused on
offensive cyberweapons. [The Russians have no such
compunctions]{.underline}. But it is unclear what Russian hackers hope
to achieve here in the Baltics, other than to make the point, as they
did in 2007 when they brought Estonia to an electronic halt, that they
can get into any system, anytime. "Whatever the Russians have in mind
--- mostly intimidation --- it usually fails," said Estonia's president,
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who grew up in New Jersey before coming here to
turn this small NATO country into a pioneer in introducing new web-based
technology for governing a nation. The 2007 attacks backfired, he noted,
because they drove Estonians far more solidly into the European and NATO
camps. In Sweden and Finland, neutral nations in the Cold War, the
politics are more complex. As the NATO exercise began in Finland last
week, the Finnish foreign minister was in Moscow, meeting his Russian
counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov. The more Sweden and Finland turn to NATO,
the more their networks, their news sites and their government
ministries come under cyberattack. As Adm. John Richardson, the chief of
United States naval operations, said at an event at the Council on
Foreign Relations in May, "[The fact is it's a pretty hot war in the
cyber domain going on right now." A hot war, but a kind that suits
Russia well: It is part of what military strategists call "gray zone"
combat.]{.underline} [For]{.underline} Mr. [Putin]{.underline},
[cyberespionage and cyberattacks keep NATO and its partners off
balance]{.underline}. **[They are enormously difficult and expensive to
defend against]{.underline}**, and, at least for now, they have operated
below the line that is likely to prompt a military or economic response.
"It stays below the radar," Martin Libicki of the RAND Corporation told
a conference sponsored this month by the NATO cyber center here,
officially known as the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of
Excellence. For the Russians, Mr. Libicki said, cyberespionage and
weaponry are part of a larger strategy of information warfare and a
blitz of propaganda that makes sorting out fact from fiction --- say,
the causes of the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine --- all the more
difficult. But the attacks also remind the smaller nations here of their
vulnerability, even if Russia's troops stay on their side of the border.
[So far, NATO has found few effective means of deterring
attacks]{.underline}.

#### The plan is resource intensive. It would require long and drawn-out negotiations

**Lonergan and Moller '22** (Erica D. Lonergan is an assistant professor
in the Army Cyber Institute and a research scholar at the Saltzman
Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. Sara B.

<https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/04/27/nato-credibility-cyber-defense-pledge-russia-ukraine-00027829>)

[NATO has achieved some strategic ambiguity with its current cyber
policy,]{.underline} which may help to deter high-stakes Russian
assaults during the present crisis. However, rather than an all-out
Russian cyberattack, a far more plausible scenario is a lower-level
attack carried out by the Russian government or a proxy group against
one or more allies. In this case, the alliance's interests --- not to
mention transatlantic security --- would be better served by adopting
nationally-tailored responses rather than pulling the Article 5 lever.
Additionally, to prevent further escalation and reinforce the implicit
firebreak that currently exists between cyber and conventional military
operations, [NATO allies should also agree to restrict any retaliatory
response against Moscow to the cyber realm or non-military instruments
of power]{.underline}. With little chance of improved NATO-Russian
relations any time soon, time is of the essence to get this right. [The
allies should begin the **hard political legwork** now to ensure members
get on the same page]{.underline} before NATO's June summit, if not
sooner. **[Achieving consensus on significant cyber issues has
previously taken time]{.underline}**. [NATO's attribution of the
Microsoft Exchange hack last summer to China was an important
step]{.underline} for the alliance and sent a strong signal to our
adversaries. [But it took months to reach agreement on the statement;
the hack was uncovered in March 2021 and the NATO statement was not made
public until July]{.underline}. In the current crisis, the alliance will
not have the luxury of waiting four (or more) months to agree on a
response. To avoid incurring damaging costs to NATO's credibility and
its deterrent powers, the allies should refine their cyber policy, now.

#### Enhanced cybersecurity requires modified procurement standards. Makes all weapons more expensive

**Schneier and Wheeler '21** (Bruce, fellow at the Belfer Center at the

<https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/hacked-drones-and-busted-logistics-are-the-cyber-future-of-warfare/)//BB>

An updated GAO report from earlier this year found some improvements,
but the basic problem remained: "[DOD is still learning how to contract
for cybersecurity in weapon systems,]{.underline} and selected programs
we reviewed have struggled to incorporate systems' cybersecurity
requirements into contracts." [While DOD now appears aware of the issue
of lack of cybersecurity requirements, they're still not sure yet how to
fix it]{.underline}, and in three of the five cases GAO reviewed, DOD
simply chose to not include the requirements at all. Militaries around
the world are now exploiting these vulnerabilities in weapons systems to
carry out operations. When Israel in 2007 bombed a Syrian nuclear
reactor, the raid was preceded by what is believed to have been a cyber
attack on Syrian air defenses that resulted in radar screens showing no
threat as bombers zoomed overhead. In 2018, a 29-country NATO exercise,
Trident Juncture, that included cyberweapons was disrupted by Russian
GPS jamming. [NATO does try to test cyberweapons outside]{.underline}
such [exercises, but has limited scope in doing so]{.underline}. In May,
Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary-general, said that "NATO computer
systems are facing almost daily cyberattacks." The war of the future
will not only be about explosions, but will also be about disabling the
systems that make armies run. It's not (solely) that bases will get
blown up; it's that some bases will lose power, data, and
communications. It's not that self-driving trucks will suddenly go mad
and begin rolling over friendly soldiers; it's that they'll casually
roll off roads or into water where they sit, rusting, and in need of
repair. It's not that targeting systems on guns will be retargeted to
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue; it's that many of them could simply turn off
and not turn back on again. **[So, how do we prepare]{.underline}** for
this next war**[?]{.underline}** First, militaries need to introduce a
little anarchy into their planning. Let's have wargames where essential
systems malfunction or are subverted---not all of the time, but
randomly. To help combat siloed military thinking, include some
civilians as well. Allow their ideas into the room when predicting
potential enemy action. And militaries need to have well-developed
backup plans, for when systems are subverted. In Joe Haldeman's 1975
science-fiction novel The Forever War, he postulated a "stasis field"
that forced his space marines to rely on nothing more than Roman
military technologies, like javelins. We should be thinking in the same
direction. NATO isn't yet allowing civilians not employed by NATO or
associated military contractors access to their training cyber ranges
where vulnerabilities could be discovered and remediated before
battlefield deployment. Last year, one of us (Tarah) was listening to a
NATO briefing after the end of the 2020 Cyber Coalition exercises, and
asked how she and other information security researchers could volunteer
to test cyber ranges used to train its cyber incident response force.
She was told that including civilians would be a "welcome thought
experiment in the tabletop exercises," but including them in reality
wasn't considered. There is a rich opportunity for improvement here,
providing transparency into where improvements could be made. Second,
[it's time to take cybersecurity seriously in military procurement, from
weapons systems to logistics and communications contracts]{.underline}.
In the three year span from the original 2018 GAO report to this year's
report, cybersecurity audit compliance went from 0% to 40% (those 2 of 5
programs mentioned earlier). We need to get much better. DOD requires
that its contractors and suppliers follow the Cybersecurity Maturity
Model Certification process; it should abide by the same standards.
Making those standards both more rigorous and mandatory would be an
obvious second step. Gone are the days when we can pretend that our
technologies will work in the face of a military cyberattack. [Securing
our systems will make **everything we buy more expensive**---**maybe a
lot more expensive**]{.underline}. But the alternative is no longer
viable.

### IL -- Zero-Sum

#### Resources are zero-sum, the plan forces a trade-off. 

**Blackwill and Fontaine '22**, (Robert is senior fellow at the Council
of Foreign Relations, Richard is Chief Executive Officer of the Center
for a New American Security, "Ukraine War Should Slow But Not Stop the
U.S. Pivot to Asia," Bloomberg, March 8, 2022,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-09/russia-s-ukraine-invasion-should-slow-not-stop-u-s-pivot-to-china)-mikee

Until recently, a wide bipartisan consensus held that China, not Russia,
represented America's greatest national security challenge and that
Asia, not Europe, was the region in which this century's fortunes would
be determined. The long-delayed "Pivot to Asia" would recognize these
realities, as the U.S. devoted greater attention and resources to the
Indo-Pacific. Russian President Vladimir Putin's brutal and unprovoked
invasion of Ukraine has upended this approach. Now Washington must deal
with revisionist great powers in two regions, while the Middle East also
continues to demand attention. [The U.S. should continue a long-term
shift to Asia]{.underline}, but in a way that better balances resources
and engagements across the three strategic theaters. Paradoxically,
Putin's aggression demonstrates how this should be done. First, [policy
makers should absorb the enduring strategic logic behind a pivot to
Asia. China combines the greatest capability and will to upend the
international order. The Indo-Pacific represents the
**primary**]{.underline}, but not the only, regional [theater in which
U.S.-China competition takes place]{.underline}. But a sustainable pivot
to Asia is possible only in the absence of serious national security
crises in Europe and the Middle East. No U.S. president will ignore a
Russian-induced emergency in Europe, a major terrorist threat, or a
nuclear and/or hegemonic Iran. America remains a global and not a
regional power. [The central challenge is all**ocating national security
resources** across]{.underline} all three [regions, without either
weakening vital U.S. national interests in one or imagining that America
can do everything, everywhere]{.underline}. [That problem is most acute
in the military sphere. An increase in defense **spending will be
required**, but how that money is spent is equally
importan**t**]{.underline}. In the Middle East, for example, regular
troops should relieve the burden placed on elite special operations
forces in security cooperation missions. Washington should move
expensive military equipment --- like F-35 and F-22 aircraft --- to the
two arenas of great-power competition, employing less-capable aircraft,
including unmanned systems, for counterterrorism missions. A combination
of regional diplomacy and continued deterrence could limit Iran\'s
regional ambitions, freeing up some of the forces that have deployed to
the Middle East in recent years to deter a potential Iran threat. In
Europe, the U.S. should build on its allies' newfound willingness to
enhance their military capabilities and deter further Russian
aggression. This should involve moving American troops currently
stationed in Europe further east, to countries such as Poland, Romania
and the Baltics. Washington should also capitalize on the recent
increase in intelligence sharing -- including to NATO non-members -- by
eliminating barriers to sharing defense technology with allies newly
willing to invest. [For the Indo-Pacific, **Washington should reserve
the lion\'s share of military resources that matter most**,]{.underline}
including smaller naval surface ships, long-range missiles and
next-generation fighter aircraft. Building on efforts like the Aukus
security arrangement with Australia and the U.K. would give regional
allies more leverage to strengthen their own defense, helping them
better deter China and serve as the frontline in daily competition with
it. **[Diplomatic resources are less zero-sum than military
power]{.underline}**, and economic engagement less still. [Intense
diplomatic work in Europe]{.underline} and the Middle [East could
bolster the coalitions in each that are willing and able to deal with
threats there, and potentially reduce some of the threats
themselve**s**]{.underline}. Washington should couple this with an
affirmative economic agenda, beginning with re-entry to or renegotiation
of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. Over the next several
years, the U.S. must adopt a slower, less-intense pivot to Asia than it
intended before Putin\'s war. That is, however, preferable to no pivot
at all, or to pretending that the crisis in European security does not
alter American plans. [The long game will be all-important]{.underline}.

<https://time.com/6152096/us-support-ukraine-china-priority/>)

[How should America respond to]{.underline} Russia's abominable invasion
of [Ukraine]{.underline}? This is a question of immense importance.
Right now, there is more heat than light in the discussion. Given the
momentous stakes, Americans must respond to this crisis [with clarity of
mind and sobriety]{.underline}. Moscow's invasion is likely to be a
hinge point in history. If nothing else, it lays to rest the idea that
history is over, that power politics and the threat of war are gone from
the developed areas of the world. This is sad, but it is a reality. In
developing our response to Russia's brazen act, we must face and adapt
to this reality. For too long, we have discounted the hard facts of
international politics. But now America must look at the world situation
much more soberly and strategically, proceeding from these hard facts
rather than ignoring them or wishing them away. Above all, [our response
must be strategic---it must match our response to the threats we face in
light of our resources and the risks we are willing to take
on]{.underline}. [The reality is that we face multiple serious threats
in different parts of the world]{.underline}. The danger Russia poses,
including to our NATO allies, is now very clear. But others have not
gone away. We also must consider Iran, North Korea, transnational
terrorists like al Qaeda, and, above all, the threat of a China that
seeks first hegemony over Asia and then global preeminence. So far this
is familiar. Less familiar but [absolutely critical is the fact that we
do not have a military large or capable enough to fight major wars
against Russia and China in even roughly concurrent
timelines]{.underline}. It is true that Europe is mainly a land theater
and the Western Pacific is mainly a maritime one. But many of the things
our [forces]{.underline} would need [to defeat Russia or China are
needed in both theaters]{.underline}---like heavy penetrating bombers,
attack submarines, advanced munitions, air defenses, and survivable
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems. Even
certain assets once thought most appropriate or necessary for Europe may
well play a critical role in a fight against China, such as Army
long-range missiles and artillery. These and other capabilities like
them would be just as vital for beating back a Russian assault as they
would be for denying a Chinese fait accompli against Taiwan---and are
already in short supply. Unfortunately, this is not a problem that we
can solve easily, quickly, or cheaply. We should seek to redress it,
but, even if we muster the will, it will take years and a significantly
larger defense budget to build more of the things we need to fight a
major war, like penetrating heavy bombers and nuclear-powered attack
submarines. In the meantime, **[what we do have can only be used in one
place at a time]{.underline}**. A missile used in Europe can't be used
in Asia, and a bomber lost over Europe will take years to be replaced.
We do also have an unparalleled network of allies. But a similar problem
confronts us here. In theory our alliance network is far stronger than
the threats we face. But in reality few of our allies have significant
militaries, and it will take those that don't significant time to
develop their armed forces even if they gather the resolve. Over the
long term, then, our strategy should be clear. We should reshape our
military to field far more of the kinds of systems needed to fight a
great power war and, with a few exceptions like sustaining our ongoing
counterterrorism efforts, dispense with those elements that are
ill-suited for it. Meantime, we should press and encourage our allies,
especially Japan, Germany, and Taiwan, to build up their conventional
defenses, and fully enable those, like Poland, Australia, and the United
Kingdom, willing to do more for their and others' defense. But this
strategy will take time to bear fruit. This is the strategy the 2018
National Defense Strategy called for---yet four years later, due to
factors ranging from inertia through political and bureaucratic
resistance to allied footdragging, we still have a long way to go. [In
the coming years]{.underline}, then, [we face]{.underline} what Henry
Kissinger called "**[the necessity for choice]{.underline}**." [We don't
have enough of the right military might to cover all the threats to our
interests. **So we must prioritize**]{.underline}. This is far from
unprecedented. The U.S. and Britain faced this dilemma in 1941, and
elected a "Europe first" strategy, prioritizing defeating much stronger
Nazi Germany before Imperial Japan. Similarly today, **[America must
prioritize]{.underline}** addressing **[the threat China poses in
Asia]{.underline}**. [Asia is the world's "decisive theater" and China
by far the most powerful other state in the world]{.underline}. If China
attains its goal of becoming dominant over Asia, it will control over
half of the global economy. Americans' fundamental liberties and
prosperity will suffer grievously. [This is the most dangerous outcome
for Americans, and preventing it **must be the priority of our foreign
policy**]{.underline}. [In practical military terms, this means that we
must ensure enough of the right military forces]{.underline}---bombers,
submarines, munitions, ISR, and the like---[are ready and available to
defend Taiwan, and on relatively short notice]{.underline}. Taiwan is
China's best target for breaking apart the anti-hegemonic coalition that
is the only way we can prevent Beijing from dominating Asia. If China
seizes Taiwan, it will deal this coalition a huge---possibly
mortal---blow. We cannot allow this. And, crucially, [this is a problem
right now.]{.underline} We don't know Beijing's assessment of the
People's Liberation Army's ability to seize Taiwan. But we do know that
[America's ability to defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan has eroded
very substantially in recent years, that it is continuing to erode, and
that Beijing's perceptions of its ability to take the island **would
rise dramatically** if it knew we had expended]{.underline} or tied down
**[critical parts of our military in or for Europe]{.underline}**. In
other words, [we are in]{.underline} or very close to [the window
**where a successful Chinese attack on Taiwan is possible**, and we
**must hedge against this risk**]{.underline}.

#### Washington has internalized a zero-sum relationship between Europe and Asia. They will trade-off resources, even if it's not legally required.

Strategy," *Strategic Studies Quarterly*,

First, [to]{.underline} influence and [maintain]{.underline} a favorable
balance of [power in Europe]{.underline}, [Washington has traditionally
relied on]{.underline} a strategy of forward [military]{.underline}
presence coupled with economic and diplomatic [engagement]{.underline}.
[But US resources are limited, and increasing demand for them in Asia
raises new questions about whether Washington can preserve
a]{.underline} favorable [European regional balance]{.underline} at a
lower cost than in the past. In this context, Washington must consider
how much influence it is willing to cede to European actors, including
Germany, Russia, Britain, France and the European Union (EU). Second, as
Europe becomes a secondary theater in US grand strategy, Washington is
compelled to ensure that Europe's key powers and institutions support US
interests when it comes to competition with Beijing, or at least that
they do not undermine US efforts in this regard. In reframing its
relationship with Europe, the US is paying increasing attention to
Europe's positions toward China and Asia. Washington recently warned
Europeans, for example, about China's efforts to leverage investments
and trade to gain technological and related strategic advantages
relative to the United States.9 China-related considerations are also
likely to gain relevance in the context of America's calculations
vis-à-vis Russia, a country that can play a direct---if
limited---strategic role in China's immediate periphery: Central Asia,
Northeast Asia, and the Western Pacific. For now, the US continues to
look at Russia (primarily) through a European lens and worries about
Moscow's potential to threaten US regional interests and upset the
European balance. However, as competition with China becomes the focus
of US grand strategy, Washington may increasingly consider how Russia
can affect that competition---whether through its relationship with
China, its ability to strain the European balance of power, or its
propensity to create challenges elsewhere in the world. [While it is
certainly conceivable that the United States could retain such
overwhelming advantages vis-à-vis all its peer competitors, or that
China's rise could organically slow or reverse]{.underline}, **[the US
does not seem to be betting on either scenario]{.underline}**.10 [The
centrality of China in US grand strategy appears to be structural,
driven by the broader eastward shift in the distribution of]{.underline}
global economic [power]{.underline}. It is therefore unsurprising that
[as the United States becomes increasingly preoccupied with China's
rise, it **adjusts strategy in other regions accordingly**]{.underline}.
The fact that Washington has labelled China as a "global" competitor
makes it difficult to isolate SinoAmerican competition in Asia and the
broader Indo-Pacific area from what happens in other theaters,
particularly Europe.

## Impacts

### ! -- Asia War

#### Asia war outweighs, threatens extinction

**Mead 10**, senior fellow @ the Council on Foreign Relations (Walter,
*American Interest*, "Obama in Asia,"
<http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2010/11/09/obama-in-asia/>)

The decision to go to Asia is one that all thinking Americans can and
should support regardless of either party or ideological affiliation. 
[East and South Asia are the places where the 21st century]{.underline},
for better or for worse, [will most likely be shaped]{.underline};
economic growth, environmental progress, the destiny of democracy and
success against terror are all at stake here.  American objectives in
this region are clear.  While convincing China that its best interests
are not served by a rash, [Kaiser
Wilhelm-like](http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/wrm/2010/09/26/in-the-footsteps-of-the-kaiser-china-boosts-us-power-in-asia/)
dash for supremacy in the region, the US does not want either to isolate
or contain China.  We want a strong, rich, open and free China in an
Asia that is also strong, rich, open and free.  Our destiny is
inextricably linked with Asia's; Asian success will make America
stronger, richer and more secure.[  **Asia's failures** will reverberate
over here, threatening our prosperity, our security and perhaps even
**our survival**.]{.underline} [The world's two most mutually hostile
nuclear states, India and Pakistan, are in Asia.  The two states most
likely to threaten others with nukes, North Korea and aspiring rogue
nuclear power Iran, are there.  The two superpowers with a billion plus
people are in Asia as well]{.underline}.  This is where the world's
fastest growing economies are.  It is where the worst environmental
problems exist.  It is the home of the world's largest democracy, the
world's most populous Islamic country (Indonesia --- which is also among
the most democratic and pluralistic of Islamic countries), and the
world's most rapidly rising non-democratic power as well.  Asia holds
more oil resources than any other continent; the world's most important
and most threatened trade routes lie off its shores.  East Asia, South
Asia, Central Asia (where American and NATO forces are fighting the
Taliban) and West Asia (home among others to Saudi Arabia, Israel,
Turkey and Iraq) are the theaters in the world today that most directly
engage America's vital interests and where our armed forces are most
directly involved.  The world's most explosive territorial disputes are
in Asia as well, with islands (and the surrounding mineral and fishery
resources) bitterly disputed between countries like Russia, the two
Koreas, Japan, China (both from Beijing and Taipei), and Vietnam.  From
the streets of Jerusalem to the beaches of Taiwan [the world's most
intractable political problems are found on the Asia]{.underline}n
landmass and its surrounding seas. [Whether you view the world in terms
of geopolitical security, environmental sustainability, economic growth
or the march of democracy, **Asia is at the center of your
concerns**]{.underline}.  That is the overwhelming reality of world
politics today, and that reality is what President Obama's trip is
intended to address.

### China Outweighs

#### China poses a larger and more probable risk than Russia

**Colby '20** (Eldridge, co-founder and principal of The Marathon
Initiative, a policy initiative focused on developing strategies to
prepare the United States for an era of sustained great power
competition. "How NATO Manages the "Bear" and the "Dragon"," Elbridge A.
Colby and Ian Brzezinski in Conversation with Nikolas Gvosdev, Orbis,
https://www.themarathoninitiative.org/2020/12/how-nato-manages-the-bear-and-the-dragon/)

Nikolas Gvosdev: **[Which is the bigger challenge, China or
Russia?]{.underline}** Or are they equivalent? Elbridge Elbridge Colby:
[**China is by a very considerable margin** the more significant
challenge to U.S. interests. The fundamental U.S. interest abroad is in
denying another state the ability to dominate a key region like Asia or
Europe. This could allow such a state to prejudice or deny our trade,
access to markets, and so forth. China is a much greater threat on both
of these scores: it is a far larger economy and thus can mount a much
more plausible challenge to establish hegemony over its region than
Russia can over Europe, and Asia is the world's largest
economy]{.underline}. **[So, the top priority must be to deny China
hegemony over Asia]{.underline}**. That said, Russia remains a challenge
in Europe, and, in particular, is a concrete military threat in Eastern
NATO; ensuring Russia does not see a plausible "theory of victory" in
this area needs to be the priority focus for the Atlantic Alliance.

### Taiwan Risk High

#### Threat of Taiwan invasion is high now -- uncertainty and force capabilities means the US needs to be extra committed. 

**Toosi & Seligman '22** (Nahal and Lara are Politico reporters, "The
U.S. overestimated Russia's military might. Is it underestimating
China's?" 06/15/2022,
https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/15/china-military-00039786)-mikee

Island of uncertainties Under China's President Xi Jinping, who has
consolidated power within the communist apparatus to an unusual degree,
B[eijing has been increasingly clear that it wants to bring Taiwan under
control of the mainland by 2050, and that any threat to that goal could
lead it to use force.]{.underline} "[Taiwan is clearly one of their
ambitions. \... And I think the threat is manifest during this decade,
in fact, in the next six years,"]{.underline} Adm. Philip Davidson,
then-commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told Congress last year.
Beijing's statements suggest that **[China could move on Taiwan at any
moment]{.underline}**, [if it believes the conditions are
right.]{.underline} "[It's dangerous to say that 2027 or
2030]{.underline} or 2035 is some heightened date," the former Defense
Department official said. "[You are actually ignoring the risk that
tomorrow something could happen."]{.underline} An invasion of Taiwan
would likely begin with an air assault and amphibious landing, analysts
and former officials say, but what happens next is a mystery. How long
can China continue launching missiles and aircraft, for example? What
capacity does Beijing have to maintain and repair equipment in a fight?
How will China's military fare if the conflict turns into urban warfare?
How will Beijing grapple with mass casualties or displaced civilians?
Unlike with Russia, which has been fighting in Ukraine and Syria over
the past decade, [there is less recent history to draw from for
China]{.underline}. Beijing has not fought a war since 1979, and its air
force has not participated in a major conflict since 1958, Garafola
noted. ["The harder thing to measure, of course, is how they would
perform in combat in a complex environment where things don't go
entirely as planned]{.underline}," said Randy Schriver, a top Asia
policy official in the Pentagon during the Trump administration. "It's
questionable that, even as they've improved their training, whether or
not they are training at complex enough levels to be able to handle
unintended or unknown developments." The United States also has limited
insight into how the different arms of the Chinese military apparatus
would work together in a high-end campaign, analysts said. The U.S.
military long ago began emphasizing "jointness" in its training
exercises and operations, meaning integrating its air, sea, space,
maritime and cyber capabilities. It's unclear Beijing can do the same in
a real-world operation. "There's a lot of talk about cyber --- we know
how they use cyber for theft of information and intelligence, but we
know less about how they might use cyber integrated into a war plan,"
Schriver said. [One area which the current reviews of foreign military
assessments are paying close attention to is China's supply lines if it
attacks Taiwan]{.underline}, the Biden administration official said.
Taiwan is an island, making resupplying invading forces a tougher task
than what Russia faces in its overland routes to Ukraine. China's
economic and diplomatic initiatives across the Pacific also offer
puzzles for American officials wondering if the efforts have a military
angle. Chinese military officers and diplomats recently gathered
alongside their Cambodian counterparts for a groundbreaking ceremony at
Cambodia's Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand. China has pledged to
upgrade the base, which sits near the South China Sea, in exchange for
the Chinese military having access to part of it, a Chinese official
confirmed to The Washington Post. Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang
Wentian said at the ceremony that the work was "not targeted at any
third party, and will be conducive to even closer practical cooperation
between the two militaries." The deal recalls Beijing's 2017
establishment of a logistics port in Djibouti in eastern Africa, a
facility leased close to an American base in the tiny country at the
mouth of the Red Sea. China has about 2,000 troops manning the base,
which is a logistics hub for wider Chinese interests on the continent.

from Planet Labs PBC shows a Cambodian naval base in Ream, Cambodia,

week on the expansion of a port facility that the U.S. and others have
worried will be used by Beijing a naval outpost on the Gulf of Thailand.
\| Planet Labs PBC via AP Photo Wrong now, right later? The U.S.
intelligence community's misjudgments of Russian and Ukrainian troops'
performance stood in stark contrast to what appeared to be far more
accurate forecasts about Vladimir Putin's plans to invade and some of
the disinformation tactics he intended to use. The United States appears
to have better intelligence about top-level Russian decision-making than
it has for China. President Joe Biden and his aides also chose to
publicize some of the intelligence in a bid to thwart Putin's plans. FBI
Director Christopher Wray testifies during a Senate Intelligence
Committee hearing about worldwide threats. When asked about why one
aspect of the intelligence --- Putin's intentions --- was right, while
the other --- his military's battlefield performance --- was off-base,
some U.S. and foreign officials said it's likely because it's a safer
bet for an analyst to forecast that a military will do well and be wrong
than to say it will do poorly and be wrong. And until that military is
actually fighting, it's impossible to know with absolute certainty how
it will do. "You err on the side of caution when it comes to defense
intelligence," James Cleverly, a top British official, said when
POLITICO asked about the issue earlier this year. Putin appeared to
believe he could quickly take out Ukraine's government, while his troops
would be greeted as liberators as they stormed the whole country. His
entire battle plan appeared premised on such notions. But in the face of
Western-backed Ukrainian resistance, he's had to recalibrate, focusing
on Ukraine's east and south for now. Some Russia-focused analysts, while
acknowledging that early expectations that Moscow would defeat Ukraine
quickly were wrong, say that, as the war drags on, Russia could get its
act together and ultimately prove correct some of their predictions
about its capabilities. "We overestimated the Russian military, but the
jury is still out on the lessons from this war," said Michael Kofman, a
Russia analyst with CNA. If anything, [the United States should **avoid
the trap of underestimating Chinese abilities** after overestimating
that of the Russians,]{.underline} some foreign affairs hands say.
During the hearing earlier this year, senators asked Haines and Lt. Gen.
Scott Berrier, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, what lessons
China was taking away from Russia's war in Ukraine. "We're not really
sure what lessons Xi Jinping is taking away from this conflict right
now. We would hope they would be the right ones," Berrier said, adding
later that one lesson could be "just how difficult a cross-strait
invasion might be and how dangerous and high risk that might be." Sen.
Josh Hawley, however, wondered if that was optimistic. After all,
efforts to deter the Russian invasion didn't work. "We pretty
dramatically overestimated the strength of the Russian military," the
Missouri Republican acknowledged. He added, however, "Don't you think
we're dealing with a significantly more formidable adversary in China?"
To which Berrier replied: "I think [China is a formidable
adversary]{.underline}."

### ! -- Taiwan 

#### Taiwan draws-in everyone -- extinction

[A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to
escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world
war]{.underline}, therefore, [many countries]{.underline} other than the
primary actors [could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan,
both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great]{.underline} [Britain,
if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the
world that participate in the global economy, in which the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China are
the]{.underline} two [most dominant]{.underline} members. [If China
were]{.underline} able [to]{.underline}successfully [annex
Taiwan]{.underline}, [the possibility exists that they could then plan
to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive
expansionism]{.underline} in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the
Pacific and even into India, [which could in]{.underline} [turn create
an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain
the threat]{.underline}. In any case, [if China and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates engage [in a full-scale
conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not
be]{.underline} economically and/or militarily [affected]{.underline} by
it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in
this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome,
therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.

@ AG

2019 has not been a good year for China. General Secretary [Xi Jinping's
ambitions and the Communist Chinese Party's **imperious means** to
achieve them have become **transparent**. The current situation in the
Asia-Pacific is **illustrative**. Two [Chinese actions defined this past
year\'s]{.mark} regional news [cycle]{.mark}. First, [China\'s reaction
to Hong Kong]{.mark}\'s peaceful pro-democratic protests **[escalated to
a full-scale military crackdown]{.mark}**. The Beijing Government
deployed [12,000 People\'s Armed Police]{.mark} -- a 1.5-million strong
army dedicated to internal security -- to the island, beating protestors
and besieging the democracy movement\'s university
strongholds]{.underline}. Most remarkable has been the resilience of
average Hong Kongers. [[The opposition lacks a designated leader and
organizational structure]{.mark}, a clear demonstration of **widespread
rage at China\'s dishonoring the Basic Law that protects Hong Kong\'s
freedoms** and to which **the CCP agreed** before Hong Kong\'s
sovereignty passed from the U.K. to China]{.underline} in 1997. [Second,
[China has **escalated its campaign against**]{.mark} **Uighur
[Muslims]{.mark}** in the country\'s West]{.underline}. **[[Internal
party documents]{.underline}]{.mark}** [have [confirmed]{.mark} that
Premier [Xi]{.mark} and his confidants [have **no qualms about**
]{.mark}**executing** the largest instance of [ethnically-targeted mass
internment]{.mark} since the Holocaust. [Beijing]{.mark} has
[constructed]{.mark} a **Stasi-style [police
state]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Xinjiang [and deported 1.5 million
Uighurs to \"reeducation\" camps.]{.underline} The more horrific
accusations -- that China harvests organs from Uighur men, and that
Chinese soldiers are raping the wives of interned Uighur men in the form
of extermination-by-forced-breeding -- are unconfirmed. However, the
situation merits a serious independent examination of these accusations.
[**[Only with the context of these events]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
combined with China's escalating aggression towards the United States
and its Pacific allies, [**[can]{.mark} the importance of [Beijing's
pressure against Taiwan be grasped]{.mark}. [Global dominance is China's
ultimate ambition]{.mark}**. A **toxic combination of [paranoia]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [imperial longing propels China's rulers]{.mark} --
[reclaiming the Middle Kingdom]{.mark}'s place at the center of the
world [requires destroying America's international position]{.mark}**,
while---as [China's rulers]{.mark} apparently [believe]{.mark}---**[its
security entails monopolizing the Western Pacific]{.mark}, eliminating
any ethnically or politically distinct entities within China, and
[ensuring Chinese access to resources and markets
abroad]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[Chinese pressure on Taiwan, therefore,
stems from the same desires that prompt repression in Hong Kong and
savagery in Xinjiang]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, [Taiwan poses a
unique problem for Beijing]{.underline}. Its links with the United
States make it a potential forward operating base for China's
adversaries, frustrating Beijing's ambitions to control the Western
Pacific. [Taiwan's democratization after decades of military rule proves
that it can govern itself without Beijing's imperial management.
Bringing Taiwan to heel, therefore, is the **inexorable result of
China's ambitions**.]{.underline} Its actions this past year demonstrate
Beijing's multi-spectrum approach to achieving this end.

Using the occasion of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore this month,
Chinese Minister of National Defense and State Councilor Gen.
[[Wei]{.underline}]{.mark} Fenghe, [[delivered a sharp message]{.mark}
to the United States, **[which may be termed the "Xi Doctrine"]{.mark}**
on China's use of force, after Chinese premier Xi]{.underline} Jinping.
[Wei declaring both China's resolve to aggress to advance its interests
and a rationalization for the use of force]{.underline}. [Wei's **de
facto threat of war** should not be lost in his nuances, deliberate
ambiguity, or in translation]{.underline}. [His remarks were so
bellicose that the world has noticed, as was certainly intended by the
leadership of the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party
([CCP]{.underline}). [[Empirical evidence of China's aggression is
increasingly common, from]{.mark} its attempt to dominate [the South
China]{.mark} Sea, the neo-imperialist effort to gain control of states
through [the Belt and Road Initiative]{.mark}, to its [technological
imperialism to control 5G and artificial intelligence
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}. What is rather less frequent are
[statements from high-level Chinese officials proclaiming the country's
intent to be aggressive and offering an attempted legitimizing principle
justifying that aggression]{.underline}. While much of the content of
Wei's remarks were in keeping with the gossamer pronouncements on
China's peaceful intentions, as well as a paean to Xi Jinping's
leadership, **[[they still conveyed that China is ready and willing to
resort to war]{.underline}]{.mark}** if the United States stands in its
way of global expansion; and they made clear that China must go to war,
or even a nuclear war, to occupy Taiwan. Specifically, [there are four
elements that comprise the Xi Doctrine and are indications of China's
signaling its willingness to use force]{.underline}. The first component
is a new and alarming proclamation of the undisguised threats to use
force or wage an unlimited war. [China is becoming bolder as its
military power grows]{.underline}. This is evidenced in Wei's muscular
remarks on the People's Republic of China's approach against Taiwan, his
explicit statement that China does not renounce the use of force against
Taiwan, and his effort to deter the United States and its allies from
intervention should an attack occur. Wei forcefully stated: "[If anyone
dares to separate Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice
but must go to war, and **must fight** for the reunification of the
motherland **at all costs**]{.underline}." "At all cost" means that
[[China will not hesitate to use nuclear weapons or **launching another
Pearl Harbor**]{.underline}]{.mark} to take over Taiwan. This is a clear
warning of an invasion. Second, [[the Xi Doctrine legitimizes
territorial expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}. Through his remarks, [Wei
sought to convince the rest of the world that China's seizure of most of
the South China Sea is an accomplished fact that cannot be
overturned]{.underline}. He made bogus accusations, which included
blaming the United States for "raking in profits by stirring up
troubles" in the region. [He insisted that only ASEAN and China must
resolve the issue]{.underline}. He claimed that [China's militarization
on South China Sea islands and reefs were an act of
self-defense]{.underline}. Should this be allowed to stand, then **[[the
Xi Doctrine will set a perilous precedent of successful territorial
expansion, which will further entice China and jeopardize the peace of
the region]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Third, **[[the doctrine]{.mark}
targets the United States as a cause of the world's major problems and
[envisions a powerful China evicting the United States from the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Wei obliquely identified the United
States as the cause wars, conflicts, and unrest, and sought to convey
that the United States will abandon the states of the South China Sea
(SCS) when it is confronted by Chinese power, a typical divide and
conquer strategy used by the CCP regime. [The Xi Doctrine's fourth
element is the mendacity regarding China's historical use of force and
current actions]{.underline}. While the distortions of history were
numerous, there were three major lies that should be alarming for the
states of the region and the global community. First, [Wei said that
China had never invaded another country, which is a claim so
transparently false it can only be a measure of the contempt he held for
the audience]{.underline}. [China has a long history of
aggression]{.underline}, including against the Tibetans and Vietnamese,
and perhaps soon against the Taiwanese. Second, Wei argued that hegemony
does not conform to China's values when, in fact, [China proudly was
Asia's hegemon for most of the last two thousand years]{.underline}.
Lastly, he claimed that the situation in the SCS is moving toward
stability---from China's perspective this stability is caused by its
successful seizure of territory. In fact, [the SCS is far less stable as
a result of China's actions. Efforts to counter this grab are denounced
by Wei as destabilizing, which is a bit like a thief accusing you of a
crime for wanting your property returned]{.underline}. Wei's belligerent
rhetoric is an indication that the CCP regime faces deep external and
internal crises. Externally, [the Trump administration]{.underline} has
shocked the CCP with the three major steps it has taken. First, it [has
shifted the focus of the U.S. national-security strategy and now
identifies China explicitly as its primary rival---abandoning the far
more muted policies of previous administrations]{.underline}. Second,
Trump has acted on this peer competitive threat by advancing tangible
measures, such as arms sales to allies and the ban of Huawei. Third,
[the [administration has made credible commitments to]{.mark} assure
partners and allies **to [counter China's aggression and
bullying]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These have unbalanced the CCP regime,
and its natural reaction is to bully its way out. Additionally, [the CCP
regime has perceived that [the world today has begun to consider **the
negative implications of China's rise**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the
United States is determined to prevent what heretofore had been
considered China's unstoppable rise. From the perspective of CCP,
conflict is increasingly seen as inevitable and perhaps even imminent.
[Wei's bellicosity should be seen in this light, and the PLA is tasked
with fighting and winning the war]{.underline}. Internally, Xi's
anti-corruption campaign that selectively targets his political
rivalries, and his abandoning the established rules such as term limited
of presidency, have introduced deep cleavages into the unity of the
regime unity. China's economic slowdown, made worse by the U.S. trade
war, is a fundamental challenge to the regime's legitimacy. Xi's
repression and suppression of the Chinese people, particularly
human-rights defenders, Christians, Kazakhs, Uighurs, and other
minorities, have miscarried. Drawing from the pages of unfortunate
history, in a classic social-imperialist move, [the regime wants to
direct these internal tensions outward]{.underline}. At the same time,
the nationalistic fervor advanced by the CCP's propaganda and by the
rapid military modernization have made many young militant officers in
the PLA overconfident. This is infrequently noticed in the West. [They
can hardly wait to fight an ultimate war to defeat the
arch-enemy]{.underline}. [This plainly dangerous mentality **echoes the
Japanese military's beliefs before Pearl Harbor**]{.underline}. The
bellicosity evinced in Wei's speech is serious and is not bluster
intended to deter. [The United States cannot meet China's threat with
half-measures, which are likely to further encourage China's aggressive
behavior]{.underline}. **[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must
respond to China's belligerence with greater strength]{.mark},
adamantine [determination, and more vigorous diplomatic and military
measures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With the Xi Doctrine, [[China has
proclaimed and rationalized its aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[A
Trump Doctrine forged in response has to reveal]{.mark} to all global
audiences, most importantly the CCP leadership, the recklessness of the
Xi Doctrine and [the]{.mark} supreme [folly of
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### A historical legacy of dominance and the way the Chinese view their role in the world confirms revisionism.

Available through ProQuest)

\"**[[Sino-centrism]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" that is related to this
historical reality [[has]{.mark} long [governed the mentality of Chinese
people.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[According to this]{.underline}]{.mark}
hierarchical [[world view]{.mark}, [China]{.mark}, as the most advanced
civilization, [is a]{.mark}t [the **center of**]{.mark} **East Asia and
[the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [and all China\'s neighbors are
vassal states]{.underline}]{.mark} (Kang 2010). This mentality was
openly revealed by the Chinese foreign minister\'s recent public
statement that I quoted previously: \"China is a big country . . . and
other countries are small countries and that is just a fact\" (Economist
2012). This view is related to Chinese people\'s ancient superiority
complex that developed from the long history and rich cultural heritage
of Chinese civilization (Jacques 2012). In a sense, China has always
been a superpower regardless of its economic standing at least in most
Chinese people\'s mind-set. The strong national or civilizational pride
of Chinese people, however, was severely damaged by \"the Century of
Humiliation,\" a period between the first Opium War (1839) and the end
of the Chinese Civil War (1949). During this period, China was
encroached on by the West and invaded by Japan, experienced prolonged
civil conflicts, and finally became a semicolony of Great Britain while
its northern territory was occupied by Japan. [[China\'s]{.mark}
economic [modernization is]{.mark} viewed as [a **national project
to**]{.mark} **lay an economic foundation**]{.underline} [to
[overcome]{.mark} this bitter experience of
[subjugation]{.mark}]{.underline} and shame and recover its traditional
position and old glory (Choi 2015). Viewed from this perspective,
economic modernization or the accumulation of wealth is not an ultimate
objective of China. Rather, [its [final goal is to return to its
traditional status]{.mark} by expanding its **global political and
military as well as economic influence**]{.underline}. What it
ultimately desires is recognition (Anerkennung), respect (Respekt), and
status (Stellung). These are important concepts for constructivists who
see ideational motives as the main driving forces behind interstate
conflicts (Lebow 2008). This reveals that constructivist elements can be
combined with long cycle and power transition theories in explaining the
rise and fall of great powers, although further systematic studies on it
are needed.¶ Considering all this, [China has always been a territorial
power rather than a trading state]{.underline}. [[China does not seem to
be **satisfied**]{.mark} **only [with]{.mark} the global expansion of
international [trade]{.mark}** and the conquest of foreign
markets]{.underline}. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[wants]{.mark}
to broaden its]{.underline}** (particularly maritime) **[territories and
[spheres of influence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to recover its]{.mark}
[traditional]{.mark} political [status]{.mark} as the]{.underline}
**[Middle Kingdom]{.underline}**. As emphasized previously, the type or
nature and goals or ideologies of a rising power matter. Nazi Germany
and Imperial Japan (territorial powers) experienced rapid economic
expansion and sought to expand their territories and influence in the
first half of the twentieth century. For example, during this period
Japan\'s goal was to create the Japanese empire in East Asia under the
motto of the East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere. On the other hand,
democratized Germany and Japan (trading powers) that enjoyed a second
economic expansion did not pursue the expansion of their territories and
spheres of influence in the post-World War II era. Twentiethcentury
history suggests that [political [regimes predicated
upon]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[nondemocratic]{.mark} or
nonliberal]{.underline}** [[values]{.underline}]{.mark} and cultures
(for instance, Nazism in Germany and militarism in Japan before the
mid-twentieth century, and communism in the Soviet Union during the Cold
War) can [[pose **significant**]{.mark} [**challenges** to]{.mark}
democratic and [liberal regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}. The empirical
studies of Lemke and Reed (1996) show that the democratic peace thesis
can be used as a subset of power transition theory. According to their
studies, states organized similarly to the dominant powers politically
and economically (liberal democracy) are generally satisfied with the
existing international rules and order and they tend to be status quo
states. Another historical lesson is that **[economic interdependence
alone cannot prevent a war for hegemony]{.underline}**. [Germany was one
of the main trade partners of Great Britain before World War
I]{.underline} (Friedberg 2011), [and Japan was the number three
importer of American products before its attack on Pearl
Harbor]{.underline} (Keylor 2011).

## AFF ANSWERS

### Ukraine Thumper

#### Ukraine thumps the link -- Biden already losing in Asia. 

**Townshend and Corben '22** (Ashley Townshend is director of foreign
policy and defense and Tom Corben is a research associate in the foreign
policy and defense program at the United States Studies Centre at the
University of Sydney. "Op-Ed: War in Ukraine Threatens America\'s
Ability to Counter China," The Strategist, MAR 16, 2022,
<https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/op-ed-war-in-ukraine-threatens-america-s-ability-to-counter-china>)

[As the United States slides deeper into a proxy war with Russia,
Indo-Pacific countries are increasingly concerned]{.underline} about the
long-term implications of the Ukraine crisis for America's power and
position in this part of the world. And so they should be. While
President Joe Biden's initial approach to Ukraine struck the right
balance of resolve and restraint---marshalling global allies in support
of sanctions against Russia and funnelling military and humanitarian aid
to Ukraine---**[the war is now sapping more and more American attention
and defence resources.]{.underline}** A dangerous tit for tat is taking
hold. [Washington's lethal military aid and economy-breaking sanctions
signal an investment in the war that could slip beyond Biden's original
articulation]{.underline} of limited interests. Russia's nuclear threats
and increasingly brutal operations have triggered further US
involvement, including the deployment of advanced F-35 fighters and
expensive Patriot missile-defence systems to NATO frontlines in Eastern
Europe, and a massive \$13.6 billion Ukraine emergency bill passed by
Congress last week. Calls are getting louder for a 'limited no-fly zone'
which, though rebuffed so far, may become politically harder to resist.
All this is understandable given the humanitarian carnage. But hot on
the heels of the release of Biden's Indo-Pacific strategy, [it's
unsettling to watch Washington's **strategic gaze** drift]{.underline},
once again, [away from a robust \"pivot to Asia.\"]{.underline} As we
argue in a new United States Studies Centre report, these developments
are especially worrying given that the Biden administration has so far
failed to deliver on key defense components of its regional strategy.
Senior US officials insist that events in Europe will not see the
Indo-Pacific or efforts to balance Chinese power deprioritised. Earlier
this month, the White House's Indo-Pacific coordinator, Kurt Campbell,
again promised that Washington was capable of sustaining \"deep
commitments\" in both theaters simultaneously, even at great cost, just
as it had in the past. But while America can---and must---continue to
buttress European security, it doesn't enjoy the luxury of riches or
unchallenged military primacy required to underwrite an expansive global
strategy against two great-power rivals. Matching ends with means in the
Indo-Pacific---America's so-called 'priority theatre'---requires
difficult trade-offs between competing priorities, including in Ukraine.
A more sustainable division of US and allied defense responsibilities in
Europe and Asia is urgently required. Biden understands this and
deserves credit for attempting to match US global interests and
commitments in his first year. Poor execution aside, his Afghan
withdrawal showed a willingness to make tough, politically unpopular
trade-offs. His initially restrained approach to the Ukraine crisis
suggested he would keep it in global strategic perspective. But
[Washington won't be able to sideline Moscow from its foreign policy
agenda the way it had hoped.]{.underline} [Delays to the publication of
the US national defense strategy and national security strategy suggest
that Russia is forcing a hurried reassessment of Biden's global
priorities. In a worst-case scenario for the Indo-Pacific, it's possible
these documents will return US military strategy to an equally weighted
focus on Asia and Europe]{.underline}---contradicting hard-fought
efforts in recent years to make China the Pentagon's outright priority.
This is not a callous point to make. America simply doesn't have the
military resources required to prosecute an effective multi-theater
strategy in an era of great-power rivalry. Nor is it spending enough to
change this equation: while the 2018 national defence strategy
recommended three to five percent real growth in defense spending
annually to keep pace with China and Russia, not a single defense budget
since has met these targets. Biden's budget continues this
unsatisfactory trend. And in contrast to the stark warnings from top
brass at US Indo-Pacific Command, who see conflict with China as a
possibility this decade, [the administration's defense budget
prioritizes long-term military modernization in anticipation of high-end
conflict in the 2030s - leaving the US underprepared to deal with
Chinese military coercion over the next few years. Budget shortfalls are
mirrored by slow-moving efforts to realign US forces
globally.]{.underline} Efforts to empower US allies are even more
important as Washington is once again pulled in conflicting global
directions. Indo-Pacific allies should advocate for more. As a priority,
Australia should caucus with Japan and other close security partners to
push for overdue reforms to US export controls on defense technology.
Indo-Pacific allies should also press Washington for greater insight and
input into its regional military planning. A credible collective defence
strategy requires clarity on when, where and how to address shared
defence challenges. Biden's effort to build support among regional
allies for a Taiwan contingency is a step in this direction. But while
Taiwan is the Pentagon's \"pacing challenge,\" regional countries face
Chinese military coercion across a far wider range of lower intensity
scenarios, as China's intimidation of an Australian military aircraft in
the Arafura Sea last month attests. New strategic planning initiatives
must reflect these realities. In the end, however, these initiatives
can't change the strategic physics of the Indo-Pacific. A favorable
balance of power with China can only be upheld with unprecedented US
support. Alliance modernization is a necessary component of this
strategy, but it's not a substitute for a robust US military posture and
presence in the Indo-Pacific. [As the conflict in Ukraine grinds on,
America's capacity to deliver an effective defense strategy for the
region will depend on its ability to keep its escalating involvement in
check and in global strategic perspective.]{.underline}

[With the **world's attention fixed** on]{.underline} the national
security and humanitarian catastrophe in [Ukraine]{.underline} caused by
Russian President Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion, [a similar
disaster is brewing in the Pacific]{.underline}. [Taking a page from
Putin's playbook, the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party, or
[CCP]{.underline}, [is methodically assembling combat power to coerce or
conquer the free people of Taiwan]{.underline}. [Preventing that from
happening will require Washington to learn the right lessons
from]{.underline} the disaster in [Ukraine]{.underline}. [Among them is
the need for Washington to **spend less time worrying** about provoking
authoritarian bullies and more time working to defend]{.underline}
threatened [democracies]{.underline} before the invasion starts. This is
especially critical as U.S. forces are much more likely to be directly
involved in a response to coercion against Taiwan. For 25 years, Beijing
has pursued a determined strategy featuring military modernization,
technological advancements, economic infiltration, cyberattacks and
persistent disinformation campaigns. These efforts have focused on
building a world-class military, erasing American military supremacy in
the seas and skies around Taiwan, and preparing for a potential attack
designed to establish CCP dominion over Taiwan. Meanwhile, **[the United
States has been distracted]{.underline}** elsewhere, **[unable to focus
its strategic and fiscal efforts on the rising power in
China]{.underline}**. [This has been compounded by consistent
congressional failures to provide the Pentagon with the timely,
sufficient and predictable funding necessary to modernize U.S. forces
and maintain sufficient readiness and capacity]{.underline}. Indeed,
[the Department of Defense has received on-time funding only once in the
last 13 fiscal years]{.underline}. Exacerbating these dynamics,
[Washington has been slow in addressing serious concerns and specific
requests for resources identified by Indo-Pacific Command]{.underline}
in successive reports to Congress. Just last year, the command again
warned that [the military balance of power in the region continues to
become "**more** **unfavorable**" for America and its
allies]{.underline}.

### No Trade-Off

#### No trade-off -- the US is and can focus on both. 

**Garamone '22** (Jim, Reporter for DOD News, "Austin: How the U.S.
Walks, Chews Gum at the Same Time," June 13, 2022,
<https://www.safia.hq.af.mil/IA-News/Article/3062747/austin-how-the-us-walks-chews-gum-at-the-same-time/>)-mikee

The Indo-Pacific is a U.S. national security strategy priority, but the
United States is a global power with global interests and
responsibilities, and \"we are walking and chewing gum at the same
time,\" Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said today in Bangkok.
As the United States works toward a free and open Indo-Pacific it also
is leading the effort to supply Ukraine with the arms, ammunition and
supplies it needs to defend itself against an unprovoked war. Further,
[the U.S. military has worked to reassure NATO allies]{.underline} with
the addition of more than 20,000 U.S. service members in the European
theater. [At the same time, there are 300,000 service members serving in
the Indo-Pacific. **The reason the United States can \"walk and chew gum
at the same time\" is because of the unparalleled network of allies and
partners**]{.underline}. Austin\'s current trip around the world is an
example how the U.S. values and relies on that network of allies. The
trip started with a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
at the command that symbolizes the close bond between the two countries
--- the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs,
Colorado. From there, Austin went to the Shangri-La Dialogue in
Singapore and then to Bangkok, where he conferred with the United
States\' oldest treaty ally. Austin spoke to reporters at the end of his
meetings with Thailand Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Prayut
Chan-o-cha to put the trip into perspective. At Shangri-La, Austin
delivered a major speech about \"the centrality of this region to vital
U.S. interests and the vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific that we
share with our regional allies and partners.\" And the secretary also
used the gathering of defense ministers to participate in bilateral and
trilateral meetings with allies and partners. These included Singapore,
Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, the countries of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, Australia and China. The secretary plainly
laid out U.S. concerns and proposals for the region. He spoke about the
need for communication between China and the United States to lessen the
chances of an escalation. He spoke of concerns over China\'s behaviors
as it tries to assert control over international waterways and air
lanes. He also said the United States \"never shies away from honest
competition, but we don\'t seek conflict, nor do we seek a region
that\'s split into hostile blocks.\" The dialogue \"was an important
opportunity to raise our concerns about the potential for instability in
the Taiwan Strait and to underscore that our long-standing policy toward
Taiwan is unwavering and unchanged,\" he said. [Austin worked with
allies to increase cooperation across the region]{.underline}. His stop
in Bangkok is another piece of this effort to increase cooperation
across the region. The United States military is working with
Thailand\'s forces to modernize the military. Discussions centered on
this and increasing the complexity of an already large exercise program
headlined by the Cobra Gold series. Now, the secretary will travel to
Brussels for the defense ministerial --- the last such meeting before
the NATO Summit in Madrid that begins June 28. While the ministerial is
important \"my first order of business will be convening the Ukraine
defense contact group for the third time,\" Austin said. \"That\'s going
to be an important opportunity to gather our growing group of partners
from around the world to ensure that we\'re providing Ukraine, what
Ukraine needs right now in order to defend against Russia\'s
unjustified, unprovoked assault.\" The group will also look at what
Ukraine will need in the long run to build and sustain defenses.
\"We\'ll hear directly from the Ukrainian leaders, led by my good friend
and counterpart Oleksii Reznikov, and we\'ll work to intensify our
shared efforts to meet Ukraine\'s priority requirements to defend
itself,\" he said. **[The bottom line to all this is that the United
States can deal in two theaters and with two competitors and then
some]{.underline}**. [He said the number of operations, exercises and
training events that the U.S. has conducted with Indo-Pacific allies and
partners over the past year \"\... is impressive in and of
itself.\"]{.underline} Austin continued, \"But by the same time, we\'ve
been able to not only to help to unify NATO, we\'ve also led the effort
to rapidly rush much needed security assistance to Ukraine with the help
of allies and partners,\" he continued. President Joe Biden has been
instrumental in solidifying NATO and other nations opposition to
Vladimir Putin\'s unjust war --- first by sharing intelligence openly
about Russia\'s intentions and then in his quick response to the
invasion itself, Austin said. \"\[NATO\] is more united than I\'ve seen
it, and I\'ve been associated with NATO since ... 1975 when Lieutenant
Austin first started down that road,\" he said. \"So, we are walking and
chewing gum. And we\'re able to do that because the strong network of
alliances and partnerships that we have around the globe.\"

#### The US can focus on both regions at once

**Kroenig '22**, deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft
Center for Strategy and Security and a professor in the Department of
Government and the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown University (Matthew, "Washington Must Prepare for War With
Both Russia and China," *Foreign Policy*,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/18/us-russia-china-war-nato-quadrilateral-security-dialogue/)//BB>

As Russia threatens the largest land invasion in Europe since World War
II, the most consequential strategic question of the 21st century is
becoming clear: [How can the United States]{.underline}
[manage]{.underline} two revisionist, autocratic, nuclear-armed great
powers ([Russia and China]{.underline}) [simultaneously?]{.underline}
[The answer, according to many]{.underline} politicians and [defense
experts, is that Washington must moderate its response to Russia in
Europe to focus on]{.underline} the greater threat posed by
[China]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific. **[This would be a
mistake]{.underline}**. **[The United States]{.underline}** remains the
world's leading power with global interests, and it **[cannot afford to
choose between Europe and the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. Instead,
[Washington]{.underline} and its allies [should develop a defense
strategy capable of deterring and, if necessary, defeating Russia and
China at the same time]{.underline}. In recent weeks, Biden has sent
several thousand U.S. troops to reinforce NATO's eastern flank---and for
good reason. A major war in Ukraine could spill across international
boundaries and threaten the seven NATO allies that border Russia,
Belarus, and Ukraine. Moreover, if Russian President Vladimir Putin
succeeds in Ukraine, why would he stop there? Putin has shown a clear
interest in resurrecting the former Russian Empire, and other vulnerable
Eastern European countries---Poland, Romania, or the Baltic
states---might be next. A successful Russian incursion into a NATO
ally's territory could mean the end of the Western alliance and the
credibility of U.S. security commitments globally. The threat posed by
China is also serious. Adm. Philip Davidson, former commander of U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, predicted China could invade Taiwan within the
next six years. This is a war the United States might lose. If China
succeeds in taking Taiwan, it would be well on its way to disrupting the
U.S.-led order in Asia, with an eye to doing the same globally.
Moreover, Russia and China are increasingly working together. As this
month's summit between Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping shows,
Moscow and Beijing are forging a closer strategic partnership, including
on military matters. These dictators could coordinate dual attacks on
the U.S. alliance structure or opportunistically seize on the
distraction provided by the other's aggression. In other words, there is
a serious risk of simultaneous major-power wars in both Europe and the
Indo-Pacific. To address this problem, many have proposed answers that
simply will not work. The Biden administration initially hoped to put
relations with Russia on a "stable and predictable" footing to focus on
China, but Putin had other ideas, as the world is now seeing in Ukraine.
Unfortunately, Washington does not get to decide how its adversaries
sequence their aggression. Others have expressed hope that Washington
can peel these powers apart or even align with Russia against China, but
these are not realistic solutions. The misguided view gaining the most
recent acceptance, however, is that Washington should simply choose the
Indo-Pacific over Europe. Politicians and experts argue that the United
States lacks the resources to take on both Russia and China. They point
to China's power and Asia's wealth and argue that Asia should be the
priority. While Washington pivots to Asia, wealthy European countries,
such as Germany, should step up to provide for NATO's defense. Indeed,
the Biden administration's National Defense Strategy, which has been
delayed due to the Ukraine crisis, is expected to focus on China without
offering a clear solution to the two-front-war problem. A good strategy
starts with clear goals---and Washington's objectives are to maintain
peace and stability in both Europe and Asia. [A good
strategy]{.underline}, however, [starts with clear goals, and
Washington's objectives are to maintain peace and stability in **both**
Europe and Asia]{.underline}. U[.S. interests in Europe are too
significant to let them be worked out solely between Putin and the
United States' European allies]{.underline}. Indeed, the European Union,
not Asia, is the United States' largest trade and investment partner,
and this imbalance is much starker when China (which the United States
seeks greater economic decoupling from), is removed from the equation.
Furthermore, China has conducted military exercises in Europe and the
Middle East. Competing with China militarily means competing globally,
not just in Asia. In addition, Xi is gauging U.S. resolve, and a weak
response in Ukraine might make a Chinese move on Taiwan more likely.
Moreover, [**the United States is not France**; it is **not compelled**
to make gut-wrenching strategic choices about its national security due
to constrained resources]{.underline}. In short, publishing [a defense
strategy that can only handle one of the United States' great-power
rivals]{.underline} (which is what is expected from the forthcoming
national defense strategy) [is planning to fail]{.underline}.

### Asia Pivot Bad

#### Pivot to Europe solves Russia war, pivot to Asia causes it

**McKinley '22** (Michael, non-resident senior adviser at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, "It's Time to Pivot Back to
Europe," Politico, 2-24-2022,
<https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/24/its-time-to-pivot-back-to-europe-00011324>)

President Vladimir Putin's recognition of the separatist republics of
Luhansk and Donetsk, which opened the door to the wider assault on
Ukraine that is now underway, is a game-changer on a historic scale. It
underscores, like nothing else, that the drift away from Europe by the
United States over the past 20 years in pursuit of wars and priorities
elsewhere has been short-sighted. Like 1949, the year in which the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization came into being, [America and its European
allies are facing a moment requiring a profound redefinition of their
security, political and economic ties]{.underline}. Going forward,
[a]{.underline} strategic, not tactical, [pivot back to Europe **should
be the driving imperative** of American foreign policy]{.underline}. In
doing so, it is important to accept reality: Putin called the bluff of
the not-very-collected West, which was equivocating by placing only
selective sanctions on Russia for its virtual annexation of part of
Ukraine. Putin is unlikely to be deterred by a staggered escalation of
these measures meant to allow room for him to change course: He is dead
set on achieving at least a partial reconstitution of the Russian empire
as he sees it and forcing the creation of a new security architecture
for Europe. Putin's words need to be taken seriously instead of being
dismissed as ramblings or misleading. For all the lingering suggestions
that there is still time for diplomacy, Putin could not have been
clearer this week that he was also setting the stage for more aggressive
steps in the very near future. He even raised a non-existent nuclear
threat to Russia from a NATO-dominated Ukraine and again dismissed
Ukrainian national identity as a fiction. Arriving at this point, too
many commentators and politicians spent months resorting to dismissive
rhetoric about Putin even as he outmaneuvered Western leaders. They
belittled Russia --- as a declining power, a declining economy and as a
nation fearful of democratization on its borders. They argued that the
United States and NATO allies could force Putin to rethink his actions
--- even though there has been no sign of him reconsidering course. Some
argued that Putin would not risk war given the likely costs. It is now
possible to see the limits of their world view. The inviolability of a
nation's sovereignty and its right to decide its own security alliances
have also been presented as self-evident truths. In the case of Ukraine,
however, many of us side-stepped uncomfortable questions about why NATO
did not invite the country to join, and about the precedents set for
Finland and Austria after World War II to ensure their neutrality. A now
prophetic article by Henry Kissinger in 2014 makes it clear that
something like the neutrality option would have been a more desirable
outcome for Ukraine and reflected the reality of Ukraine's situation.
The West will find it difficult to break the momentum that Russia is
building, or to reverse the new realities Putin is creating.
[Russia]{.underline} may not be a colossus, but it remains one of the
most powerful countries in the world, with a nuclear arsenal, a
modernized military and a serious player in international oil and gas
markets. It [cannot]{.underline}, in other words, [be dismissed only as
a "regional power threatening its neighbors out of
weakness,"]{.underline} and while it is becoming an outright
dictatorship by smothering democracy at home, that is not a central
concern in the current crisis. [Russia can project its military
globally]{.underline} --- as its interventions in Syria and elsewhere
have shown. [It can wage cyberattacks on Europe and the United States
with relative impunity]{.underline}. Putin has triumphed in political
showdowns with leaders like Turkey's President Erdogan and, even as
Russia's relationship with Europe in general turns adversarial, the
likes of Serbia and NATO member Hungary appear more sympathetic to
Putin. World leaders until last week came to Putin as he limited his own
international travel --- and gave little away. Russia's diplomatic
fortunes are hardly crumbling elsewhere, as evidenced by a rising
entente between China and Russia --- aligned in their security interests
against perceived Western encroachment. There is another factor at work,
and that is that Putin's view of history, often seen as opportunistic,
does appear to be a primary driver of his actions. And it is not his
worldview alone. The incorporation of Russian-speaking populations
inside neighboring borders after 1991 remains an issue for nationalists
in Moscow; and the West has systematically downplayed how NATO expansion
since 1997 has looked to a generation of Russian leaders, and not just
President Putin. It is not dovish, as a recent New Yorker article
suggested, or appeasement as a British defense minister stated, to take
these perceptions into account in the current crisis. The deep
undercurrents of historical myth drive almost every nation into
destructive paths. It is in this context that the United States and its
allies have chosen to draw a line in the sand over a further Russian
military intervention in Ukraine which has now materialized on a major
scale. The relative success of President Joe Biden in preserving a
united front with European allies on a gradual escalation of sanctions
masks the lingering challenges of fully cohering on strategy. There have
been differences between the responses by the United States and Britain
on the one hand; the French and the Germans on another; and disparate
governments like Italy (opposed to energy sanctions as late as this past
weekend) and Hungary (offering veiled sympathy to Russia's demands).
French President Emmanuel Macron until recently was openly discussing
the need for a new security architecture for Europe. Chancellor Olaf
Scholz of Germany told national reporters on his return from Moscow that
"we just can't have a possible military conflict over a question that is
not on the agenda" regarding Ukraine's future membership in NATO. As EU
foreign ministers met in Brussels this week, there were continued
differences between those arguing for "incrementalism" on sanctions like
Germany and Italy, and those wanting a more forceful response. There may
be greater unity now as the scale of the Russian invasion becomes clear,
but the proof will only be evident in the coming days. The allies'
caution in recent days contrasted with President Zelensky's increasing
concern as options close around him. The gathering of senior NATO and EU
ministers at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 18-20, as well as
the presence of a U.S. delegation led by Vice President Kamala Harris,
did not convey the strongest confidence on an agreed approach to Russian
aggression. President Zelensky's speech at the gathering was a searing
indictment of the lack of decisiveness of Western nations over the last
many years, and Ukrainian ministers were publicly critical of the slow
pace of the imposition of sanctions since the recognition of the
separatist republics by Russia. [Western governments are now at a real,
not hypothetical crossroads]{.underline}. The invasion is underway, and
Putin would appear to be achieving his long-stated objectives, some of
which he began to make clear 15 years ago in a speech to the 2007 Munich
Security Conference. He has torn up the 2015 Minsk agreement which was
meant to be the foundation for talks between Ukraine and Russia
regarding the future of the Donbas. Putin is calculating he can survive
sanctions for an indefinite period as he builds a significant war chest
of foreign reserves. He is also betting on a swifter and easier military
victory in Ukraine than Western analysts are predicting. If either of
these scenarios were to hold, NATO, EU and American threats or actions
would end up ringing hollow to most of the rest of the world. Putin, in
short, means to complete what he has started, and more. As Lithuanian
Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis suggested, Ukraine may not be
the end of the story, and Belarus' renewed and total subservience to
Moscow can, in retrospect, be seen as prelude to Putin's attempt to do
the same to Ukraine. In responding to Russia's expanding aggression in
Ukraine, Western nations will build towards ever more severe sanctions.
There will be United Nations resolutions and condemnations. Russian
oligarchs may lose their right to residence and investment in London and
Paris. Nord Stream 2 is being suspended and may be canceled. NATO may be
strengthened; European members may finally spend 2 percent of their GDP
on defense. NATO may accelerate military assistance to Ukraine or arm an
insurgency in Ukraine in the future. The broader international community
may be galvanized into supporting harsher measures to punish Russia
depending on the scale of the conflict. Longer-term, however, the latest
developments suggest it is time to rethink the West's approach to the
next phase of dealing with Putin. That will entail recognizing that the
security landscape of Europe is being changed as we watch, in real time,
and is unlikely to be turned back to what it was any time soon. The
response must stop Russia from destroying the post-World War II
architecture that has largely preserved peace for 70 years. Doing so
will require another historic decision and response. [We need to
revitalize NATO and the transatlantic economic and political relations
which have been **weakened for two decades as the United States
prioritized Asia**]{.underline}, abandoned trade agreements, diverted
NATO to fight wars farther afield and allowed allies to take for granted
the alliance's centrality to their own collective defense. In the
process, we may rediscover that [the future of the United States is
still **most fundamentally impacted by what happens in
Europe**]{.underline}.

#### Asia pivot breaks NATO

[The US focus on China is controversial]{.underline}, in part, [because
it comes at a moment when relations between NATO and Russia are severely
strained. NATO's Eastern European members don't want China to
"overshadow" concerns about Russia]{.underline}. Multiple Eastern
European states have competed for additional US forces ---though to
little avail. Poland even offered, in 2018, to name a military base
after President Donald Trump. Now, **[NATO waits]{.underline}** for the
US Global Posture Review, which will provide guidance
**[on]{.underline}** how best to allocate **[US military resources going
forward]{.underline}**. The review will be heavily scrutinized. [If it
re-aligns US military resources towards East Asia, the **cracks in NATO
may continue to grow**]{.underline}.

### Europe Focus Solve China

#### Europe is a key counterbalance against Chinese leadership

University School of Advanced International Studies (Shay, "Why Has
America Forsaken Europe?," *The Bulwark,*

[The United States needs **Europe to be peaceful** because it needs NATO
and the EU to be productive]{.underline}. [The size of Europe's economy
makes it an important **counterbalance to China**]{.underline}'s growth.
British, French, and Spanish ties with Africa are important in pushing
back against China's growing influence in the continent. European
universities still produce stellar research which is crucial in the
technological competition with China. [Each of Europe's strengths in a
competition with China also makes it an important region in its own
right]{.underline}. [With three-quarters of a billion people, it is an
important trade partner and plays a key role in the American economy. It
is home to many U.S. military bases used for important
missions]{.underline}, most recently during the evacuation from
Afghanistan. Its scientific and technological achievements contribute to
American prosperity---the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that the president of
the United States and millions of others recieved would not have been
made without German partnership. **[America can't afford to take Europe
for granted]{.underline}** anymore. They need us and **[we need
them]{.underline}**. The hard part of alliance management is supposed to
be responding to the needs, wants, and objectives, and insecurities of
the other side. But lately, the United States has had more trouble
figuring out what its own needs, wants, and objectives in Europe
are---or if it has any at all.

### No China War

#### **No US-China war**

**Lei 20**, PhD and MA in International Politics, associate research
fellow with the China Institute of International Studies. (Cui,
7-24-2020, \"Despite heated talk, risk of a US-China hot war is small\",
*South China Morning Post*,
<https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3094121/why-risk-us-china-hot-war-small-despite-heated-talk>)

[Many]{.underline} observers [are pessimistic about deteriorating
US-China relations and believe the two countries are **heading
towards**]{.underline} a cold **[war]{.underline}**. Even worse, [some
argue that the situation might be **more dangerous** than the US-Soviet
Union Cold War, and that a **hot war might break out** between the two.
This argument is **unconvincing**]{.underline}. **[First]{.underline}**
of all, [**deterrents** to a flare-up are]{.underline} much
**[strong]{.underline}**er [**in US-China relations** than in US-Soviet
relations]{.underline}. Although economic and people-to-people ties
between China and the US are declining, they are still close compared to
US-Soviet ties. [It is **hard to decouple** two **closely intertwined
economies** and **societies**.]{.underline} Take two examples. [China is
expected to become the world\'s **largest consumer market**, a
temptation **hard to resist** for exporters, **including** those from
the US. And in **education**, more than **300,000 Chinese students**
study in the US, bringing in **huge revenues** for the US education
industry]{.underline}. Many universities go to great lengths to woo
international students. Recently Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology even sued the government over its new visa restrictions,
now aborted, on international students. [Second, **even if** there is
decoupling, the pain would **not be too great** and can be **kept out**
of the **national security sphere**]{.underline} if properly handled. In
fact, for national security reasons, a modest degree of isolation will
make both sides more secure and comfortable. For instance, if China's
information technology equipment cannot capture Western markets, the US
will be more relaxed. If China cannot get advanced technologies from the
US and its technological progress slows down, the US will be less
anxious. In the same vein, China feels assured knowing that if the Trump
administration does impose a travel ban on Communist Party members, it
would be abandoning one of the tools available to the US to promote
"peaceful evolution" in China. Economic decoupling is undeniably more
painful for China than for the US. But unlike Japan during WWII, which
was hit hard by the US oil embargo because of its lack of natural
resources, China has no such problems. Given its large domestic market,
losing the US as a major customer is not a disaster for China, and can
be compensated through more dynamic economic activities at home. China
can also make up for being freezed out of technological exchanges by
turning to indigenous innovation. As for the US, it can import goods
from other developing countries, albeit less cheaply. The relative loss
is acceptable when weighed against the heightened perception of economic
independence and security. [Third, the ideological confrontation between
China and the US is **less intense**]{.underline} than that during the
Cold War. Unlike the obsession with ideology in those days, [the line
between capitalism and socialism is **blurred** today. The **market
economy** has become **universally recognised** as the best way to
promote economic growth]{.underline} and, politically, many countries
have embraced democracy. Even North Korea calls itself the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. Although ideological hawks in the US still
long for the day when the beacon of freedom will light up the world,
[after **many years** of fighting **bloody wars overseas**, most
American people are **not interested** in promoting democracy
abroad]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [China just wants to **preserve its
political system** and has **no interest in exporting it** to other
countries, as the Soviet Union did. Thus, ideological **antagonism** in
China-US relations can easily be **eased** by calculations of realistic
**interests**, which create conditions for **compromise and
cooperation**. **Fourth**, both China and the US have **many options
other than war** to achieve their policy goals]{.underline}. While they
have no allies to serve as a buffer, given the nature of the potential
conflict in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, [both countries are
**adept at operating in grey zones** and fighting psychological, public
opinion or diplomatic warfare **below the threshold of
war**]{.underline}. The forced closure of the Chinese consulate in
Houston by the US government is just the latest act of brinkmanship. In
addition, [given China's huge economic and financial interests in the
US, the latter can **wield the stick of sanctions** when use of force is
**highly risky** or not worth it.]{.underline} [When both sides have
**many tools and options,** why would they **rush to war** to achieve
their goals? **Last**]{.underline} but not least, [the **imbalance of
power** will act as a deterrent]{.underline}. Some say the US and Soviet
Union did not fight a hot war because they were evenly matched. It was
not the case, actually. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet
Union was at a relative military disadvantage. Moreover, [a country
needs the **will to fight** before **going to war,** even if it is
stronger militarily than its adversary. Having fought **years of
meaningless wars**, the US is **weary of war**]{.underline}. [China,
too, **abhors war**. Having a **clear understanding** of US strength,
**especially** when its own economy is **slowing down** and it is facing
**various domestic challenges**]{.underline}, [China would **not wish**
to **recklessly start a war with the US**. In summary, the possibility
of a **hot war** between China and the US is **very
small**]{.underline}. The greatest danger for China is not a cold or hot
confrontation with the US, but policymakers' interpretation of the
momentary hostility towards Beijing of a portion of the American
population and the larger world. An erroneous interpretation could end
China's march to further opening up, and see it turn instead towards
self-isolation.

#### No US-China war -- nuclear deterrence and geographic factors

**Keck 17** (Zachary, Wohlstetter Public Affairs Fellow at the
Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, former researcher at the

editor of The National Interest, "The 2 Forgotten Reasons China and
America Probably Won\'t Go to War", The National Interest, 8-26-2017,

//ghs-ag

In recent years, many observers have woken up to the fact that [a war
between the United States and China is not unthinkable. Although this is
true, there are still strong pacifying forces]{.underline}. **[Two
factors strike me as the most important. The first]{.underline}**, and
most obvious one**[, is that [both sides maintain secure nuclear
arsenals]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As Thomas Schelling and others have
pointed out, [nuclear weapons are not a game-changer]{.underline} simply
[because of their massive destructive capabilities]{.underline}. [The
speed and certainty]{.underline} of nuclear retaliation is just as
important. These two characteristics [simply aren't present with
conventional weapons]{.underline}. Leaders can delude themselves into
thinking their conventional forces, however improbably, will end up
victorious in battle. In any case, the consequences of being wrong are
far in the future. For instance, Imperial Japanese leaders knew it was a
tremendous gamble to take on the United States. Isoroku Yamamoto, the
Japanese admiral who planned Pearl Harbor, warned his civilian
leadership beforehand: "In the first six to twelve months of a war with
the United States and Great Britain I will run wild and win victory upon
victory. But then, if the war continues after that, I have no
expectation of success." After the American economic embargo, however,
Japanese leaders were only faced with bad options: capitulating in the
face of American pressure or fighting a more powerful enemy in a likely
futile effort. In these circumstances, Tokyo decided to gamble. After
all, it was conceivable that America would be so exhausted from fighting
Nazi Germany in Europe that it would ultimately sue for peace in Asia,
especially in the face of fierce Japanese resistance. Can America and
Its Allies \"Play Fort\" against China Deadly Missiles? While the
outcome of conventional wars hinges on a number of unknowable factors,
nuclear retaliation is certain. And, [unlike with conventional
weapons]{.underline}---especially before airplanes and missiles---[[one
doesn't have to defeat the other side's military to wreak havoc on its
cities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nuclear weapons can do so immediately.
Moreover, as Robert Jervis points out , [when two countries with secure,
thermonuclear arsenals go to war, "the side that is 'losing' the war as
judged by various measures of military capability can inflict as much
destruction on the side that is 'winning' as the 'winner' can on the
'loser.]{.underline}'" This changes the calculation of leaders, and
makes it inconceivable that rational leaders would opt for total war.
This is not foolproof of course--- there is still the possibility that
miscalculations, gradual escalation, or the "threats that leave
something to chance" will produce an outcome neither side wanted--- but
**[[it is a strong incentive for peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [While it
is]{.underline} widely [recognized that nuclear weapons make a
U.S.-China conflict less likely]{.underline}, the pacifying effect of
geography is often overlooked. Geography works to attenuate tensions in
two interrelated ways. First, b[oth China and the United States are
massive countries that would be extremely difficult to conquer and
occupy]{.underline}. [Second, [both are separated by the largest ocean
on earth]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and it is extremely difficult to
project power over large bodies of water. As John Mearsheimer has
written : "[When great powers are separated]{.underline} by large bodies
of water, [they usually do not have much offensive capability against
each other, regardless of the relative size of their
armies]{.underline}. Large bodies of water are formidable obstacles that
cause significant power-projection problems for attacking armies."
[These two geographical factors reduce the intensity of the]{.underline}
so-called security [dilemma]{.underline}. Despite all their disputes
over issues like Taiwan and the East and South China Seas, **[[China and
the United States generally do not have to fear that the other side will
seek to invade and conquer them]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This has usually
not been the case for rising and ruling powers that went to war. In many
of these instances, the rivals were located on the same continent or
even shared a border, which generated significant insecurity and led to
conflict. As Mearsheimer again explains , "Great powers located on the
same landmass are in a much better position to attack and conquer each
other. That is especially true of states that share a common border.
Therefore, [great powers separated by water are likely to fear each
other less than great powers that can get at each other over
land]{.underline}."

### [No Taiwan War]{.underline}

#### PLA doesn't have the capability to invade Taiwan

Ben **Westcott '19** is a Digital News Producer based in Hong Kong, who
joined CNN in 2016. He writes about China, Australia and Indonesia, June
24^th^, 2019, "A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be a bloody,
logistical nightmare" from
https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/asia/taiwan-china-invasion-intl-hnk/index.html,
accessed 7/5/19 \|\| OES-AT

Roaring out of the sky, an F-16V fighter jet lands smoothly to rearm and
refuel on an unremarkable freeway in rural Taiwan, surrounded by rice
paddies. ¶ In different circumstances, this could be alarming sight.
Taiwan\'s fighter pilots are trained to land on freeways between sorties
in case all of the island\'s airports have been occupied or destroyed by
an invasion. ¶ Luckily, this was a training exercise. ¶ [There\'s only
really one enemy that Taiwan\'s armed forces are preparing to resist \--
China\'s People\'s Liberation Army (PLA).]{.underline} And as China\'s
reputation as an economic and military superpower has grown in recent
years, so too has that threat of invasion, according to security
experts. ¶ Taiwan has been self-governed since separating from China at
the end of a brutal civil war in 1949, but Beijing has never given up
hope of reuniting with what it considers a renegade province. ¶ At a
regional security conference in June, Chinese Defense Minister Wei
Fenghe said: \"[If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese
military has no choice but to fight at all costs for national
unity.\"]{.underline} In some shops in mainland China, you can buy
postcards and T-shirts emblazoned with patriotic emblems promoting the
retaking of Taiwan. ¶ But for seven decades, **[[China has resisted
attacking Taiwan partly for political reasons, including the prospect of
a US intervention and the potential heavy human
toll.]{.underline}]{.mark}** But the [practical realities of a
full-blown invasion are also daunting for the PLA, according to
experts]{.underline}. ¶ Ferrying hundreds of thousands of troops across
the narrow Taiwan Strait to a handful of reliable landing beaches, in
the face of fierce resistance, is a harrowing prospect. [[Troops would
then have a long slog over Taiwan\'s western mudflats and mountains to
reach the capital]{.mark}, Taipei.]{.underline} ¶ Not only that, but
[China would face an opponent who has been preparing for war for almost
70 years]{.underline}. ¶ At mass anti-invasion drills in May, Taiwan
military spokesman Maj. Gen. Chen Chung-Chi said the island knew it had
to always be \"combat-ready.\" ¶ \"Of course, we don\'t want war, but
only by gaining our own strength can we defend ourselves,\" he said.
\"If China wants to take any action against us, it has to consider
paying a painful price.\" ¶ Difficult and bloody ¶ [It could be easy to
assume that any invasion of Taiwan by Beijing would be brief and
devastating for Taipei]{.underline}: a David and Goliath fight between a
tiny island and the mainland\'s military might, population and wealth. ¶
With nearly 1.4 billion people, the People\'s Republic of China has the
largest population in the world. Taiwan has fewer than 24 million people
\-- a similar number to Australia. China has the fifth largest territory
in the world, while Taiwan is the size of Denmark or the US state of
Maryland. And Beijing runs an economy that is second only to the United
States, while Taiwan\'s doesn\'t rank in the world\'s top 20. ¶ But
perhaps most pertinently, China has been building and modernizing its
military at an unprecedented rate, while Taiwan relies on moderate US
arms sales. ¶ In sheer size, the PLA simply dwarfs Taiwan\'s military. ¶
China has an estimated 1 million troops, almost 6,000 tanks, 1,500
fighter jets and 33 navy destroyers, according to the latest US Defense
Department report. Taiwan\'s ground force troops barely number 150,000
and are backed by 800 tanks and about 350 fighter aircraft, the report
found, while its navy fields only four destroyer-class ships. ¶ Under
Chinese President Xi Jinping, the PLA has rapidly modernized, buoyed by
rises in military spending and crackdowns on corruption in the army\'s
leadership. ¶ \"China\'s leaders hope that possessing these military
capabilities will deter pro-independence moves by Taiwan or, should
deterrence fail, will permit a range of tailored military options
against Taiwan and potential third-party military intervention,\"
according to a 2019 US Defense Intelligence Agency report on China\'s
military. ¶ [Yet while China hawks in the media might beat the drum of
invasion, an internal China military study, seen by CNN, revealed that
the **[PLA considers an invasion of Taiwan to be extremely
difficul]{.mark}t**]{.underline}. ¶ \"[[Taiwan has a professional
military]{.mark}, with a strong core of American-trained
experts,\"]{.underline} said Ian Easton, author of \"The Chinese
Invasion Threat\" and research fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, as
well as \"highly defensible\" terrain. ¶ In his book he described an
invasion by China as \"the most difficult and bloody mission facing the
Chinese military.\" ¶ The plan to take Taiwan ¶ China\'s Taiwan invasion
plan, known internally as the \"Joint Island Attack Campaign,\" would
begin with a mass, coordinated bombing of Taiwan\'s vital infrastructure
\-- ports and airfields \-- to cripple the island\'s military ahead of
an amphibious invasion, according to both Easton and Sidharth Kaushal, a
research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and
Security Studies. ¶ At the same time, the Chinese air force would fly
over the Taiwan Strait and try to dominate the island\'s air space. Once
the PLA was satisfied it had suitably disabled Taiwan\'s air and naval
forces, Kaushal said soldiers would begin to invade on the west coast of
the island. ¶ The island\'s rocky, mountainous east coast is considered
too inhospitable and far from mainland China. ¶ The amphibious invasion
needed to put troops on Taiwan, however, could be the biggest hurdle
facing the PLA. ¶ In its 2019 report to Congress, the US Department of
Defense said China \-- which has one of the largest navies in Asia \--
had at its command 37 amphibious transport docks and 22 smaller landing
ships, as well as any civilian vessels Beijing could enlist. ¶ That
might be enough to occupy smaller islands, such as those in the South
China Sea, but [an amphibious [assault]{.mark} on Taiwan [would likely
require a bigger arsena]{.mark}]{.underline}[l]{.mark} \-- and there is
\"no indication China is significantly expanding its landing ship
force,\" the report said. ¶ That makes it vital for Beijing to
neutralize Taiwan\'s navy and air force in the early stages of an
attack, Kaushal said. ¶ \"The Taiwanese air force would have to sink
around 40% of the amphibious landing forces of the PLA in order to
render this sort of mission infeasible,\" he said. ¶ Essentially,
that\'s only about 10 to 15 ships, he added. ¶ If they did make it
across the strait, [the [PLA]{.mark} would still [need]{.mark} to find a
decent [landing spot]{.mark} for its ships]{.underline}. ¶ China\'s
military would be looking for a landing site both close to the mainland,
and a strategic city, such as Taipei, with nearby port and airport
facilities. ¶ That leaves just 14 potential beaches, Easton said \-- and
it\'s not only the PLA that knows it. Taiwanese engineers have spent
decades digging tunnels and bunkers in potential landing zones along the
coast. ¶ Furthermore, [the backbone of [Taiwan\'s defense is]{.mark} a
fleet of vessels [capable of launching anti-ship cruise missiles, on top
of an array of ground-based missiles, and substantial mines and
artillery]{.mark} on the coastline.]{.underline} ¶ \"Taiwan\'s entire
national defense strategy, including its war plans, are specifically
targeted at defeating a PLA invasion,\" Easton said. ¶ Chinese troops
could be dropped in from the air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA
makes it unlikely. ¶ [If the PLA held a position on Taiwan, and could
reinforce with troops from the mainland to face off about 150,000 Taiwan
troops, as]{.underline} well as more than 2.5 million reservists, it
would have to push through the island\'s western mud flats and
mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, towards Taipei. ¶
Finally, the mobilization of amphibious landing vessels, ballistic
missile launchers, fighters and bombers, as well as hundreds of
thousands of troops, would give Taiwan plenty of advance warning of any
attack, Kaushal said. ¶ \"It\'s extremely unlikely that the invasion
could come as a bolt from the blue,\" Kaushal added. ¶ There is, of
course, [one final deterrent to any PLA invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}.
¶ It isn\'t clear whether or not such an attack by China would spark an
intervention by the United States on Taipei\'s behalf. ¶ Washington has
been a longtime ally of the island, selling weapons to the Taiwan
government and providing implicit military protection from Beijing. ¶
Easton said that, at present, the US would likely intervene in Taiwan\'s
favor, both to protect investment by US companies on the island and
reassure American allies in the region, who are also facing down a
resurgent PLA in the East and South China seas. ¶ Collin Koh Swee Lean,
research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies\'
Maritime Security Program in Singapore, said there would also be
\"immense political consequences\" from taking over Taiwan, in the event
of a successful China invasion. ¶ \"It will likely mean that China will
be seen as the bad guy in the neighborhood, who uses force,\" he said.
\"It will alienate some regional partners and the good will which China
has been trying to build over the years will evaporate. And it will set
China on a collision course with the US.\" ¶ But Taipei isn\'t taking
anything for granted. ¶ On the sidelines of the massive Han Guang
drills, Taiwan\'s Maj. Gen. Chen pointed out the hundreds of spectators
who had come out to watch and support the island\'s military. ¶ \"These
exercises let people know the national army of the Republic of China is
ready,\" he said. ¶ Taiwan is taking no chances.

#### Trade ties make closer Taiwanese ties with China inevitable

Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/why-the-us-may-lose-taiwan-to-beijing-economically/)SEM

In March 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the House
Foreign Affairs Committee that China is a threat to the United States.
"This is a great power battle and we're engaged in it across the world,"
he added. [China now challenges American influence in]{.underline} all
aspects, and [Taiwan]{.underline} represents a frontier in this hybrid
competition. While the island's security still relies heavily on
Washington's guarantees, **[there's a rising risk that the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [may]{.mark} [lose Taiwan to Beijing
economically]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} There are three reasons
for this trend. A Drifting Taiwan The first is Taiwan's drift.
[[Taiwan's trade dependency]{.mark} on the United States was largely
[replaced by]{.mark} dependency on [China]{.mark} after
2001]{.underline}, when both Taiwan and China entered the World Trade
Organization (WTO). The share of Taiwan's total trade involving the
United States halved, falling from 23 percent to 12 percent, from 1998
to 2018, while [[China's share doubled from 15 to 31]{.mark}
percent]{.underline}. In January 2017, Taiwan adopted a New Southbound
Policy (NSP) attempting to divert the island's exports away from China
and into South and Southeast Asia, but without concrete results.
[Taiwan's export reliance on China increased 2 percentage points to 41
percent in 2018, peaking historically at 45 percent]{.underline} that
March, while the export share to the 18 countries covered in the NSP
decreased by 1 percentage point in the same period. Simply put, this new
policy did not work well. Even worse, [Taiwan's global strategy is not
leading anywhere]{.underline}. There are two groups of regional
integration emerging around Taiwan, but the island is unlikely to enter
either. First, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP),
which targets 16 Asia-Pacific countries, including China, would require
Taiwan to join as a province of China --- a condition Taiwan simply
cannot accept. Second is the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for
Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which includes 11 Trans-Pacific
countries, now led by Japan after the withdrawal of the United States.
However, China may also block Taiwan by pressuring its partners to veto
any Taiwanese bid to join. The alternative for Taiwan to promote its
trade relations is to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with major
economies. Yet the political issue of the status of Taiwan would halt
most negotiations in the first round. Unfortunately, [Taiwan's economy
is drifting to the middle of nowhere]{.underline}. A Pulling China The
second factor is China's pull. [**[China's economic attraction for
Taiwan is growing at both the regional and local levels]{.mark}.**
China's GDP per capita has increased nine times]{.underline} on a
purchasing-power-parity basis [since 1990. This formed a strong economic
gravity pulling all neighboring economies into China's orbit --- and
particularly Taiwan]{.underline}, which is just 100 nautical miles off
the mainland's southeast coast. [China now is capable of offering
**lucrative incentives** to convert the loyalty of its commercial allies
as the]{.underline} existing economic hegemon --- namely, the [United
States]{.underline} --- [is in relative decline]{.underline}. For
example, some [Eurasian leaders]{.underline} in developing or
underdeveloped countries may [see China's Belt and Road Initiative as a
good opportunity. They may also feel that the]{.underline} Chinese-led
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ([AIIB) is more accessible than
the]{.underline} American-led [World Bank]{.underline} in granting big
loans for development projects. [At the local level, China's economic
influence on Taiwan specifically has become more **tangible and
comprehensive**]{.underline}. Since the late 1980s, Taiwanese investment
had been lured by preferential policies from Chinese central and local
governments. As of last year, the total amount of [Taiwanese investment
in China has accumulated to \$180 billion]{.underline} --- 10 times the
Taiwanese investment in the United States in the same period. As a
result, over [400,000 Taiwanese quality managers and talents are
currently working and living in Chinese cities]{.underline} with their
family members. The total number may surpass 2 million people, close to
one-tenth of Taiwan's population. In terms of cross-strait relations,
[the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resumed warm ties in 2008 and
reached 23 agreements during Ma Ying-jeou's presidency]{.underline}. Yet
the official channel of dialogue was suspended after President Tsai
Ing-wen's inauguration in May 2016. Beijing began to unilaterally
conduct cross-strait affairs without prior consultation or negotiation
with Taipei. Even while cross-strait tensions rose, [in January 2018,
quasi-citizenship was granted to Taiwanese living, studying, or working
in China and some national treatments involving subsidies or bank loans
were opened to Taiwanese enterprises. [Beijing's carrot-and-stick
approach towards Taiwan remains, and **the carrot is growing
sweeter**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} A Pushing America Meanwhile, [the
United States risks pushing Taiwan away]{.underline}. President Donald
[Trump's Taiwan policy]{.underline}, if there is one, [has been
inconsistent between political and economic affairs since 2017. In
politics, the United States has strengthened its security commitment to
Taiwan to tackle the escalating tension in the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}. The new Taiwan Travel Act, taking effect in March
2018, encouraged more frequent and higher level official exchanges
between Washington and Taipei. To maintain Taiwan's capacity of
self-defense, informal notification of a \$2 billion [sale
of]{.underline} 108 M1A2 tanks and [weapons was sent to the U.S.
Congress]{.underline} in early June. Another, bigger package ---
possibly including 66 F-16V fighter jets --- may also seek Congress'
approval later this year. The Pentagon has further made naval patrols in
the Taiwan Strait a new normal to contain Beijing's maritime aggression.
Nonetheless, [**these [policy favors do not apply to the
economic]{.mark} [field]{.mark}**. While economic ties have faded in
recent years, the U.S. Trade Representative]{.underline} (USTR) [Office
did not change its tough attitude toward Taiwan]{.underline}. Its latest
annual report reiterated serious concerns over Taiwan's bans on U.S.
pork products and beef products containing ractopamine. Due to this
first priority issue, the [USTR has suspended regular trade
talks]{.underline} since October 2016, [and put on hold the initial
steps of preparing an FTA with Taiwan.]{.underline} During the APEC
summit last November, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence agreed to bring the
Taiwanese envoy's request to restart talks back to Washington but there
was no change. Apparently, the USTR is not inclined to compromise on
this issue. Another case is even more acute and embarrassing. [[Taiwan
was subjected to Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum]{.mark} imports
to the United States]{.underline} starting in March 2018, [because
Taiwanese steel products were suspected to contain China-made steel. In
response, [Taiwan]{.mark} resorted to severe measures that [restricted
its steel products]{.mark} with any content of China-made steel [from
being exported to the U.S]{.mark}. market. Taipei even launched a
self-investigation]{.underline} into dumping and government subsidies
focused on select China-made steel products sold in Taiwan from 2015 to
2017. [Embarrassingly, these extra efforts were all in vain, and Taiwan
was not included on the tariff exemption list. **While politicians in
Washington have been wooing Taiwan, their economists are sabotaging that
effort.**]{.underline}

In the abstract, such claims are alarming---in context, and in balance,
rather humdrum. In fact, [the **evidence** of a]{.underline}ny [Chinese
intention to]{.underline} destroy, or even merely
**[undermine]{.underline}** and exploit, [the current order is
**slight**]{.underline}. [China **is**]{.underline} certainly [using
its]{.underline} growing [military power to **defend** its **claims in
the SCS**]{.underline} and even---on occasion--- to coerce its
neighbors. [It uses **protectionist**]{.underline} economic
**[policies]{.underline}** to boost the prospects of Chinese companies
and reduce competition. [It employs **economic statecraft**]{.underline}
to serve its interests abroad. And it certainly is opposed to America's
policy of global democracy promotion. [However, **none** of these
positions **fundamentally challenge the existing order**, **none** of
them **radically depart** from America's **own actions** when it was a
**rising power**]{.underline} in the nineteenth century, [and none of
them **obviously surpass** America's **own contemporary record** of
**order subversion**]{.underline}. When [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates was a rising power, it [took **half of
Mexico**]{.underline} [and **considered taking the rest**,]{.underline}
[it **colonized** the **Philippines** and **Hawaii**]{.underline}, [and
it **unilaterally seized** the **maritime choke points of the
Caribbean**]{.underline} (Puerto Rico and Cuba).21 [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [used
**tariffs**]{.underline}---which by 1857 averaged 20 percent22 and by
the end of the nineteenth century were "the highest import duties in the
industrial world"23---[to **protect its industries**]{.underline}. [It
**stole intellectual property**]{.underline},24 [and]{.underline} it
[**ideologically challenged** the governments of the "Old
World."]{.underline} Today, despite no longer being a rising power, [the
U]{.underline}nited [States has launched]{.underline} two **[disastrous
invasions]{.underline}**, **[tortured prisoners]{.underline}**, [and
dispatches **drone strikes at a whim** with **little international legal
authority**]{.underline}.25 The point is not that two wrongs make a
right; it is that [international order is **much more resilient** than
**critics seem to realize**]{.underline},26 [and it is **utopian** to
expect any **rising Great Power** to act in a way that **uniformly
satisfies** one's **moral scruples**,]{.underline} evolving, in
Friedberg's words, "into a mellow, satisfied, 'responsible' status quo
power."27 Friedberg or Harris might object that America's rise took
place in the context of a different order. This is perfectly true, but
the more important point is that the long nineteenth century
(1815--1914)---the era of America's rise---was the first iteration of
the New Peace.28 The implication is that [relative peace **can** and
**has** **coexist**ed with **limited wars**, **property** and
**territorial thefts**, acts of **coercion**, and **aggressive
assertions of status.** This does not mean any of these are
**desirable**]{.underline}--- they are [not---but it shows that they
**need not be fatal to the system**]{.underline}. [Insofar as there
**is** a lesson from that **first period** of **relative peace**, it is
that **Great Power confrontation** is the **one thing that is
fatal**]{.underline}. [Accepting this does not mean **capitulating** in
**every instance**, as implied by some]{.underline},29 [but it **does**
mean **rediscovering** the rules of **Great Power
competition**]{.underline}30 alongside the art of strategy.31 Focusing
only on areas that China's rise violates the scruples of the established
powers, moreover, downplays the extent to which [China,
**has**]{.underline}, in fact, [**conformed** to the **existing
order.**]{.underline} As a RAND Corporation report published in 2018
concludes, China has been a supporter---albeit a conditional one---of
the international order: "Since [China undertook a **policy of
international engagement**]{.underline} in the 1980s ... the level and
quality of its participation in the order rivals that of most other
states."32 The way in which **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping, following his
2017 Davos speech in defense of globalization, [has been heralded as the
**most prominent champion of international order** and **defender of
globalization**]{.underline} underscores the fact that [there are
**different elements** of this order, and that China supports **many**,
if not **most, of them**]{.underline}. [Even in places where China is
**supposedly "altering"** the current order, Beijing tends to
simultaneously **affirm that order**]{.underline}. [China's Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank]{.underline}, for instance, actually
**[mirrors existing structures]{.underline}**, and China has
intentionally copied elements and "best practices" of the World Bank and
Asian Development Bank. [China is **playing the same game**, even if it
is **seeking a bigger role within it**]{.underline}.33

### China Not a Threat

#### The US has the overwhelming military advantage

[The US military dominates the strategic, tactical, and operational
levels of warfare across the spectrum. The Pentagon is implementing
sophisticated network warfare programs]{.underline} such as the Advanced
Battle Management System, Project Convergence, and Joint All Domain
Command and Control. [China is concerned]{.underline} about the lethal
and distributed US military, equipped with a potent combination of
quantity and quality of weapon systems. [The USN surpasses the PLAN in
rapid deployment, maneuverability, and expeditionary warfare
capabilities. The overwhelming display of US military power since 1945
**is a credible deterrent for Beijing**]{.underline}. [Since the First
Gulf War, the United States has demonstrated its capability of
destroying the adversary through preemptive strikes consisting of
long-range weapon systems such as cruise missiles in the first few days
of the war, giving no time for the adversary to
retaliate]{.underline}.75 According to Taylor Fravel, **[China is not a
military superpower]{.underline}**.76 [There is not]{.underline} much
[evidence about China's plans for global military capabilities on par
with the United States. China's military power is miniscule as compared
to United States' former adversary the Soviet Union]{.underline}.
**[China's military will be thinly stretched]{.underline}** defending
the third-largest country in the world. [The top echelons of the CCP and
PLA acknowledge US military advantages]{.underline}. [Chinese
scholars]{.underline} like Xu Ruike and Sun Degang [admit]{.underline}
that [China is an economic heavyweight but is a military featherweight
and **will remain so** for the coming decades]{.underline}.77 **[US
primacy]{.underline}** in the post--Cold War world **[has prevented
World War III]{.underline}**. The two most likely contenders for
expansion, North Korea and China, have restricted their militaries
within their borders. [The United States retains **unrivaled** military
power, and China is **not in a position to challenge it**]{.underline}.

#### The US leads across all military spectrums

**Sawant** 12-13-20**21** (Mangesh, master's in international affairs
from Columbia University, where he concentrated in international
security policy, "Why China Cannot Challenge the US Military Primacy,"

<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2870650/why-china-cannot-challenge-the-us-military-primacy/)//BB>

Why **[China Cannot Challenge the United States]{.underline}** People's
Liberation Army ([PLA]{.underline}) [Major]{.underline} General Zhang
Shaozhong [ranked Chinese military power in 2020 in the fifth
place]{.underline} behind the United States, Russia, Britain, and
France, [while PLAN surface power was ranked in the eighth
place]{.underline} behind Japan and India. The Peoples Liberation Army
Air Force ([PLAAF]{.underline}) [was ranked seventh]{.underline} in the
world, due to its lack of fourth-generation fighter planes and high-end
drones. In General Shaozhong's view, China will become the
second-largest military power in the world only in 2049, when it
celebrates its centennial anniversary.27 The US Military as an Economic
Deterrent [The US military plays the central role of economic
deterrence]{.underline}. The Communist Party of China
([CCP]{.underline}) [gains its legitimacy from economic
development]{.underline}. [It is possible that China could target Guam
with its small fleet of]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic missiles
([ICBM]{.underline}). [However, the use of ICBMs will lead to massive
retaliatory strikes by the United States leading to total annihilation
of China's military and economic centers of gravity]{.underline}.28 The
USN Maritime Strike Tomahawk Cruise Missile Block V will destroy coastal
cities like Shanghai, obliterating China's hi-tech industries in a
matter of hours. The CCP leadership is inexperienced in nuclear matters
as it lacks exposure to a nuclear warfare strategy as practiced by the
United States and Russia. [China's nuclear policy is based on low-level
deterrence, "minimum deterrence," and its nuclear arsenal remains small
and vulnerable]{.underline}.29 **[Threatening the United
States]{.underline}** with 200 nuclear weapons **[is not an
option]{.underline}**. Geographically, the United States and China are
similar in size. However, [China's economy will be decimated by a few US
nuclear weapons, as its critical infrastructure is concentrated on the
coastlines and not dispersed like the US infrastructure]{.underline}. [A
war will lead to a loss of China's exports]{.underline} to the United
States worth USD 310 billion. The war will result in a decline in
industrial production, unemployment, and inflation, causing an economic
crash and a people's revolution. As seen from World War II, the United
States will experience reverse economic gains and benefit from the war,
resulting in high employment and industrial growth. It is expensive to
be a superpower. Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War two and a half
millennia ago, "first count the cost."30 China's defense budget cannot
compete with the combined power of United States, India, Japan, and
Australia. The United States alone spends more on national defense than
China, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom,
Japan, South Korea, and Brazil combined.31 Can China afford it? An arms
race will lead to an increase in China's military spending, affecting
its development goals. The Absence of War-fighting Experience The United
States has an analytical learning process in place---China does not.32
Lessons learned have been well documented by the US military in the form
of doctrines, tactics, techniques, and procedures. The US military has
been documenting lessons learned since as early as the Boxer Revolution
during the China campaign.33 The US military has been led by outstanding
military generals like George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, George
Patton, and David Petraeus, while China always lacked great generals.
The world sends its military officers to US military institutions and
not China's military colleges. [The PLA strategy is based on Mao's
theory of the weak contender fighting a stronger adversary through
deceit and deception. China's only option is an asymmetric
strategy]{.underline} due to its incapability to fight symmetric wars.
Chinese scholars have authored books like Science of Military Campaigns,
Science of Military Strategy, and Unrestricted Warfare.34 However, China
is unable to convert the strategies and tactics mentioned in these books
into an executable doctrine. The Lack of Power Projection Power
projection capabilities set a superpower apart. From its Charm Offensive
to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has been wielding its
economic power to compel US allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific
region to align with China, which has not been greatly successful.35
China lacks global reach, as it does not have foreign defense treaties
or logistical bases abroad equipped with military stockpiles.36 During a
war with the United States, soliciting Pakistan's military support looks
difficult, as China's all-weather friend has been hesitant to cut its
military ties with the United States. [China is constrained to operate
beyond the unrefueled range of its aircraft, warships, and
submarines]{.underline}. [US nuclear-powered carriers can rule the seas
for four years before being refueled]{.underline}. China's
nonnuclear-powered AC can barely operate beyond its green waters. The
Type 903 replenishment ship can only support two to three ships for
approximately two weeks.37 The USN's 68 nuclear-powered submarines have
been prowling the world's oceans displaying naval power, while the
PLAN's nuclear-powered submarines are unable to do so. Fighter aircraft
operating without a package of air-refueling tankers, Airborne Warning
and Control System aircraft, or a network of expeditionary airfields
cannot travel very far. The PLAAF's capability to target US bases in the
Pacific is hindered by a lack of air-refueling capacity. A flight group
of eight J-11B Flankers will have to be simultaneously refueled twice by
two air-refueling tankers for a seven-hour flight.38 The PLAAF will have
to deploy 20 percent of its tanker fleet to refuel the Flankers. The
PLAAF has 10 tankers for more than a thousand fighter aircraft, while
the USAF has 625 tankers for 1,956 fighter aircraft.39 The tankers will
be the prime targets for the USN potentially putting the Flankers at
risk. [China's only existing bomber, the H-6K, is reverse engineered
from the 1950s Soviet-designed Tu-16 bomber]{.underline}. The bomber is
incapable of attacking Hawaii---even when equipped with CJ-10 cruise
missiles. The H-6K has a range of 3,800 miles, while Hawaii is 5,157
miles from the closest H-6K base. The H-6K cannot attack nearby US
bases, as the bomber will be detected on open seas by the US C4ISR
systems. [PLAAF fighters are unable to escort the bombers, as they
cannot match its range]{.underline}.40 An Archaic Military [Less than 30
percent of China's surface forces, air force, and air defense forces and
55 percent of its submarine fleet were modern in 2011]{.underline}.41.
Subsequently, nothing much has changed, as a substantial percentage of
China's military remains obsolete.42 [China's military faces
institutional shortcomings]{.underline} arising from obsolete command
structures, low quality of personnel, and corruption.43 The military has
weaknesses centering on supporting capabilities such as logistics,
inadequate airlift, and deficient air defense and antisubmarine
warfare.44 The PLA's loyalty to the CCP has hampered its competence.45
China's military training and operational capabilities and competences
do not match US standards.46 PLAAF pilots fall short on the requirement
of executing sophisticated aerial maneuvers during unplanned
operations.47 [China's military structure presents significant cultural
challenges]{.underline},48 [as it emphasizes control above
command]{.underline}.49 [A culture of risk aversion and low levels of
trust in subordinates impacts the PLA effectiveness]{.underline}.50 A
highly centralized structure does not allow the PLAN to operate
autonomously during a war. Therefore, a political commissar is
positioned on PLAN warships and submarines.51 The USN values autonomy
from the individual to the institution, which reflects its emphasis on
commanding at sea.52 Nation states cannot project power globally through
a rigid command-and-control system.53 [PLAN submarines have the worst
safety record in the world]{.underline}.54 The PLAN's rudimentary
nuclear missile submarine fleet carries a limited number of missiles.55
The PLAN cannot threaten the US mainland, as its submarines will have to
sail through chokepoints such as the Kuriles and the Ryukyus islands,
Luzon Strait, Taiwan Strait, and the Philippine archipelago---all of
which are controlled by the USN.56 These chokepoints, forming a
crescent-shaped chain, are also a defensive line for US containment
policy; and the United States is involved in monitoring them. The PLAN
submarine power is outdated, compared to the overwhelming USN undersea
warfare capabilities. The US submarine arm brings strategic deterrence
to the Indo-Pacific through a wide array of capabilities such as
antisubmarine warfare antisurface warfare precision land strike;
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and special warfare
capabilities. Soviet weapon systems were much sought after by the United
States to learn their strengths and weaknesses. Numerous Soviet-made
fighter aircraft defected during the Cold War. An Iraqi MiG 21 defected
to Israel, while a Soviet MiG 25 landed in Japan. The aircraft were
later handed over to the United States to decipher the technical
details. However, US intelligence is not similarly orchestrating any
defections of PLAAF fighter aircraft, as the United States is not
interested in obsolete Chinese technology. Instead, China is stealing
weapon data or reverse engineering US weapon systems.57 The
CCP-controlled military press described the Shenyang J-15 Flying Shark
fighter aircraft as a "flopping fish" and criticized it for lacking the
stealth capabilities of the F-35 Lightning.58 The US F-117 Nighthawk
stealth fighter entered service in 1983 and saw combat during the First
Gulf War, while the fifth-generation F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning
fighter aircraft have been deployed in conflict zones. However, the
PLAAF has not operationally inducted the J-31 fighter aircraft while the
J-20 fighter aircraft has not yet proven its capabilities in any
bilateral or multilateral military exercise. The much-hyped Chengdu J-20
is a heavy fighter aircraft comparable to the MiG 31, which is
essentially an interceptor and not a multirole or an air superiority
aircraft. China's Vulnerable A2/AD Zones A study of modern wars suggests
that [the United States will **decimate** China's military without
entering the A2/AD zone]{.underline}. This is how the United States
devastated Iraqi defenses in 1990. US strategic depth in Asia will allow
military planners to concentrate the military at different locations.
[The United States has a devastating array of lethal weapon
systems]{.underline}, such as submarines, [for countering China's A2/AD
strategies]{.underline}. During the First Gulf War, the United States
launched 297 Tomahawks, which destroyed the Iraqi military.59 Ohio-class
submarines can operate unhindered in the adversary's A2/AD zone closer
to the shore; thus, striking targets far inland. Collectively, four
Ohio-class submarines installed with 616 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise
missiles would obliterate China's military. The inexperienced PLAN AC
group will be destroyed by long-range antiship missiles (LRASM),
Tomahawks, and Mark 48-Mod 7 torpedoes launched from USS Key West, USS
Oklahoma City, USS Topeka, and USS Asheville submarines based in Guam.
The USN and USAF have signed a USD 414 million contract for autonomously
guided with onboard sensors, jam-resistant, and difficult to detect
antiship LRASM.60 The stealthy Zumwalt-class warship---equipped with
emerging technologies---can sail undetected in littoral waters and
contested territories to launch LRASM and Tomahawk cruise missiles.
China is constructing military bases on islands in the South China Sea;
however, this military infrastructure is vulnerable to US weapon
systems, as the islands lack natural defenses and camouflage.61 During a
war, the bases will be annihilated by the USN as the PLA cannot hide
behind hills and forests. Once destroyed, these facilities cannot be
supported from the mainland, as the logistical supplies will be
demolished by the USN. China's military modernization may enhance A2/AD
zones, but it does not contribute to a blue-water, sea-control
capability.62 [China's Hyped DF-21 Missile]{.underline} The antiship
DF-21 missile, carried by colossal transporter erector launchers, has a
range of 1,400 miles. The missile regiments are based in the barren Gobi
Desert, which makes it an easy target for the US military. [The DF-21
has been tested on a stationary ship, but it has not yet been
successfully tested against a moving target]{.underline}.63 A system of
systems is required to track the AC,64 acquire the precise location,
keep the missile locked on the target, penetrate the carrier's
multilayered defenses, and provide mid-course updates as within one hour
the ship will have moved 30 miles. China does not know about the DF-21
performance against the US CSG countermeasures.65 The United States and
Russia have not yet developed a missile equivalent to the DF-21.
However, China lacks the C4ISR systems to strike targets at that range.
China does not release the missile testing data, leading to many
questions, including whether it can hit moving targets. Does it have
precision targeting technologies?66 Until proven otherwise, [the
functionality of the missile is based on nothing but circumstantial
inference and speculation]{.underline}.
