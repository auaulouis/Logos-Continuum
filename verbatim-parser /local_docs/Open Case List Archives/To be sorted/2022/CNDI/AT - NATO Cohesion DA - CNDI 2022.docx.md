[NATO released its new Strategic Concept]{.underline} on Wednesday, and
leaders are expected to offer pledges to establish a new "Defense
Innovation Accelerator" for the North Atlantic.¶ **[The need for more
focus and investment in emerging technology is a major
theme]{.underline}** of this week's NATO Summit in Madrid, which
President Biden is attending along with his European counterparts.¶ [The
innovation accelerator "will support NATO's efforts to boost
interoperability]{.underline} [and ensure that every Ally has access to
cutting-edge technological solutions]{.underline} for military needs,"
according to a White House fact sheet released Wednesday.¶ The United
States will contribute to the initiative by facilitating access to U.S.
test centers and other technology "accelerator sites" in the "extensive
and diverse U.S. innovation sector," it said.¶ [The military alliance is
also launching a new innovation fund]{.underline} that will invest 1
billion Euros in startups and other organizations developing "dual-use"
emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday during a press conference.¶
Together with the new innovation accelerator, the fund will help the
alliance "harness the best new technology for transatlantic security,"
he said.¶ NATO's new Strategic Concept, released Wednesday, states:
"[Emerging and disruptive technologies]{.underline} bring both
opportunities and risks. They [are altering the character of
conflict]{.underline}, acquiring greater strategic importance [and
becoming key arenas of global competition. Technological primacy
increasingly influences success on the battlefield]{.underline}."

[Plans also call for enhancing cybersecurity]{.underline}.¶ "**[Building
on last year's adoption of a new Cyber Defense Policy for NATO, Allied
leaders will endorse a new action plan to strengthen cyber
cooperation]{.underline}** across the political, military, and technical
levels," the White House said. "As an operational domain for NATO,
**[cyber will also be a key component of NATO's strengthened deterrence
and defense posture]{.underline}**. Building on lessons learned from the
conflict in Ukraine, [Allies will decide at the Summit to use NATO as a
coordination platform for offering national assets to build and exercise
a virtual rapid response cyber capability]{.underline} to respond to a
serious cyber-attack. The United States will offer robust national
capabilities as part of this support network."¶ Cyberspace is now
"contested at all times," the Strategic Concept stated.¶ "Malign actors
seek to degrade our critical infrastructure, interfere with our
government services, extract intelligence, steal intellectual property
and impede our military activities," it said. [The alliance intends to
expedite its "digital transformation," adapt the NATO Command Structure
for the "information age" and enhance its cyber defenses]{.underline},
networks and infrastructure.¶ "[We will work together to adopt and
integrate new technologies]{.underline}, cooperate with the private
sector, protect our innovation ecosystems, shape standards and commit to
principles of responsible use that reflect our democratic values and
human rights," the document said.¶ The new Strategic Concept --- the
first update in more than a decade --- also focuses on space as a key
technology area and warfighting domain.¶ "[We will enhance our ability
to operate effectively in space and cyberspace to prevent]{.underline},
detect, counter and respond to the full spectrum of
[threats]{.underline}, using all available tools," it said, noting that
"a single or cumulative set of malicious cyber activities; or hostile
operations to, from, or within space; could reach the level of armed
attack and could lead the North Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5 of
the North Atlantic Treaty" and trigger collective defense responses that
could include armed conflict.¶ [The alliance also intends to boost the
resilience of its space and cyber capabilities which are at risk of
being attacked]{.underline}.

unique,]{.underline}**" Stoltenberg said on June 30. "It is the world's
first multi-sovereign venture capital fund ever."¶ ¶ He said the fund
will invest its money in "early-stage start-ups, and other deep-tech
funds across 22 participating nations." **[The fund is geared to operate
over a 15-year period]{.underline}**.¶ ¶ [The goal of the
effort]{.underline}, he said, **[will be "harnessing the best of new
technology for transatlantic security]{.underline}**," and "maintaining
our technological edge \[that\] has helped to keep our Alliance strong
and our nations safe for more than seventy years."¶ ¶ "Today, nations
that do not share our values, like Russia and China, are challenging
that lead in everything from Artificial Intelligence to space
technologies," Stoltenberg said. "[It is essential that we do everything
in our power to remain at the forefront of]{.underline} innovation and
[technology]{.underline}."¶ ¶ "This Fund, alongside DIANA, NATO's
Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, will help to do
just that," he said. "The NATO Innovation Fund will help bring to life

### N/U- Greece/Turkey Disputes

#### Nonunique- NATO currently divided over Turkey conflict 

#### Daily Sabah '22 (Staff written, "NATO urges Turkey, Greece to resolve disagreements over Aegean," Daily Sabah, 2022.06.15, <https://www.dailysabah.com/politics/diplomacy/nato-urges-turkey-greece-to-resolve-disagreements-over-aegean)-> HL 

[NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday urged Turkey and
Greece to resolve their disagreements over the Aegean Sea, where the two
are at loggerheads over islands and airspace.]{.underline} \"Diverse
views and debate are an essential part of our democracies,\" the head of
the trans-Atlantic military alliance told Greek news agency ANA. But, he
said, \"we urge Greece and Turkey to solve their differences in the
Aegean in a spirit of trust and Allied solidarity.\" \"That means
restraint and moderation, and refraining from any actions or rhetoric
that could escalate the situation.\" Stoltenberg\'s comments came two
weeks after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan declared Turkey would no
longer participate in regular high-level meetings with Greek leaders
intended to foster cooperation between the two countries. [Erdoğan
raised the stakes last week, warning Greece to demilitarize its Aegean
islands and saying he was "not joking."]{.underline} He spoke during
Turkish wargames near the Greek islands that included an amphibious
landing scenario. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis responded
that he would not engage in a \"ping-pong\" of personal insults with
Erdoğan. [The two NATO allies have long been at odds over a number of
issues including offshore rights, ownership of uninhabited islets,
competing claims over jurisdiction in the Eastern Mediterranean,
overlapping claims over their continental shelves, maritime boundaries,
airspace, energy, the ethnically split island of Cyprus, the status of
the islands in the Aegean Sea and migrants]{.underline}. [They have come
close to war three times in the past half-century,]{.underline} while
NATO stepped in when a dispute over drilling rights for potential oil
and gas deposits in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea led to a tense naval
standoff in the summer of 2020. [Turkey says Greece is stationing troops
on islands in the Aegean in violation of peace treaties signed after the
World Wars, demanding that Greece demilitarize its eastern islands,
citing the 20th-century treaties that ceded sovereignty of the islands
to Greece]{.underline}. [Greece counters that the islands need defenses
given threats of war from Turkey, which has NATO\'s second-biggest
military and maintains a large landing fleet on its Aegean
coast.]{.underline} [Turkey in recent months has stepped up criticism of
Greece stationing troops on islands in the eastern Aegean, near the
Turkish coast and in many cases visible from shore.]{.underline} These
islands were required to be demilitarized under the 1923 Treaty of
Lausanne and the 1947 Treaty of Paris, so any troops or weapons on the
islands are strictly forbidden. Starting with the Treaty of London in
1913, the militarization of the eastern Aegean islands was restricted
and their demilitarized status was confirmed with the signing of the
Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. The Lausanne pact established a political
balance between the two countries by harmonizing vital interests,
including those in the Aegean. The 1947 Treaty of Paris, which ceded the
Dodecanese islands from Italy to Greece, also confirmed their
demilitarized status. However, Greece argues that the 1936 Montreux
Convention on the Turkish Straits should be applied in this case, while
Ankara says Greece's obligation to disarm the islands remains unchanged
under the Montreux Convention, highlighting that there is no provision
that differentiates it from the Treaty of Lausanne on the issue.

The West, however, must deal with Putin as he is. He has legitimate
complaints about short-sighted Western policies. [For years the U.S. has
devalued diplomacy out of ignorance and hubris, which undermines
national security and NATO]{.underline}. [NATO and EU expansions were
good ideas, but were **uncoordinated,** and **poorly developed** and
**executed**]{.underline}. Abandoning most arms control, which benefited
American-Russian mutual security, was a major mistake, leaving our
European allies to face Putin\'s missile threats. None of those,
however, justifies Putin\'s war in Ukraine. Putin\'s unilateral,
military threats fundamentally challenges the post-Cold War order, not
just in Ukraine. [The West\'s biggest mistake,]{.underline} however[,
was **failure to maintain a credible NATO** deterrent posture in
Europe]{.underline}. [European nations allowed their military
capabilities to deteriorate;]{.underline} some became
impotent[.]{.underline} The Alliance was blind and unresponsive to
leadership and policy changes in Moscow over two decades. Putin is not
Gorbachev or Yeltsin; yet NATO acted as though he were. [NATO **ignored
U.S. urgings to strengthen itself**,]{.underline} and the warnings of
its East Central European members even after the 2014 annexation of
Crimea and take-over of part of the Donbas. [These errors make NATO
partly responsible for the invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} - a sin of
omission. [The immediate reaction of NATO to the invasion is a plus,
provided it **is a first step of a new era in European security**
thinking and NATO policies.]{.underline}

#### No link- NATO is unified in its integration of cyber and AI into the alliance mission

Nick **Fouriezos 6/29/22**

continents; Blinken: NATO is 'more united, more focused' after historic
summit; Atlantic Council;
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/blinken-nato-is-more-united-more-focused-after-historic-summit/

On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken pushed for world
leaders to continue sustained action---in supporting Ukraine, in
pressuring Russia, and in reinforcing NATO on the heels of its historic
decision to invite Finland and Sweden to join the defensive alliance. ¶
"[NATO is emerging from this summit more united]{.underline}, more
focused, and with more assets [to deal with a multiplicity of
challenges,]{.underline}" Blinken said, praising the solidarity shown in
this week's gathering in Madrid. ¶ [The conversations at the two-day
NATO Public Forum]{.underline}, taking place on the sidelines of the
Madrid summit, [brought together a number of global leaders]{.underline}
in person and virtually, including US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who
reaffirmed US support for Article 5, the principle of collective
defense, as "ironclad." ¶ "This alarming challenge to national
sovereignty must be met by a unified global commitment to peace and
security," Pelosi said of Russian aggression, while also calling for
action to defend against China through continued "cooperation with our
Asia-Pacific partners to bolster cybersecurity, counter disinformation,
and preserve our collective defense." ¶ This week, [NATO nations agreed
on a new Strategic Concept that declares the Alliance's priorities in
staving off]{.underline} military and economic [threats from Russia and
China]{.underline}, reasserting shared democratic values and
human-rights protections, **[and battling new threats from the realms of
cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.]{.underline}**¶ "[All of
these things are challenges we have to meet and face]{.underline},"
Blinken said, "**[but we know that we're going to be more effective in
doing it if we actually have a shared, common approach."]{.underline}**

President-Elect Joe [Biden]{.underline}'s transition team [has declared
cyber threats as "one of the defining challenges of our
time]{.underline}." In its early days, the incoming US administration
must take on cybersecurity threats as one of its key priorities.
[Nowhere will that effort be more important than with]{.underline} the
United States' closest Allies at [NATO]{.underline}, a cornerstone for
Western security. Today, [NATO's security is threatened by Russia's and
China's continuous cyberattacks]{.underline} on the Alliance and its
members. **[To accomplish its mission of deterrence]{.underline}** and
defense, **[NATO needs to implement a strategy of proactive, continuous
responses to China and Russia in cyberspace]{.underline}**, where great
power competition is playing out in real time.¶ [Russia and China
challenge NATO and its members in cyberspace on a daily basis, as part
of ongoing hybrid campaigns to undermine the transatlantic
community]{.underline}. The Kremlin's actions have involved intrusions
into Allies' critical infrastructures, manipulating Allies' elections
through hacks and disinformation, and even blocking GPS information
critical to NATO activities. The Chinese government has engaged in cyber
espionage against Allies' military capabilities; intellectual property
theft related to sensitive technologies, industries, and infrastructure;
and disinformation against transatlantic countries, including around the
coronavirus. [These efforts to weaken NATO countries and Alliance
cohesion represent a persistent threat to Allied security.]{.underline}¶
[NATO has recognized the collective dangers of these hybrid attacks in
cyberspace. Up to this point, however, the Alliance has taken a reactive
approach]{.underline}, responding as if Russian and Chinese cyber
attacks are each isolated incidents. [But because Russian and Chinese
cyber efforts are part of continuous campaigns directed at the overall
capability of the Alliance, NATO's response has been
insufficient]{.underline}, failing to reduce or dissuade further
attacks. [To assure the security of its members going forward, NATO
needs its own continuous response campaign to these
threats.]{.underline}¶ President-elect Biden and his team have pledged
to renew [US]{.underline} leadership in [cooperation]{.underline} with
Allies and partners. That agenda [should start at NATO]{.underline},
**[and a key focus should be on cybersecurity]{.underline}**. In early
NATO meetings, the Biden administration should champion a cybersecurity
continuous-response campaign, built around three key actions.

DON'T LET RUSSIA DOMINATE THE STRATEGIC CONCEPT; War on the Rocks;
https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/dont-let-russia-dominate-the-strategic-concept/

When NATO members agree on a new Strategic Concept at their summit in
Madrid, Russia's invasion of Ukraine will dominate the discussion. But
with this existential crisis rightfully taking center stage, [other
threats have not gone away. The challenge for NATO is to situate
Russia's invasion in a wider strategic context, addressing other key
issues]{.underline} before they create new existential crises in the
future.¶ [What does this mean in practice?]{.underline} We contend that
despite the current centrality of the Russo-Ukrainian war,
[Sino-American rivalry is likely to drive U.S. national security
thinking in the coming decades. NATO's 2022 Strategic Concept should
address this]{.underline} reality. Among the many challenges in Asia and
the broader Indo-Pacific, China's designs on Taiwan figure most
prominently. China is watching the Russo-Ukrainian war closely, seeking
to draw strategic lessons. This dynamic need not be catastrophic for
European and trans-Atlantic security. It creates opportunities for
E.U.-NATO cooperation and greater European strategic autonomy (or
strategic responsibility) in the context of an enduring trans-Atlantic
bond. Europe and Asia are increasingly linked as two theaters in a
global system hinging on the United States and anchored in its alliances
in both regions. The strategic concept should thus lay out a vision for
how NATO can simultaneously compete with both China and Russia.¶
**[There are also several specific threats and challenges]{.underline}**
that [the]{.underline} 2022 [Strategic Concept should
address.]{.underline} First, **[allies should tackle the effects of
emerging and emerged disruptive technologies on]{.underline}**
strategic, defense, and force **[planning]{.underline}**. Second,
[adversaries are increasingly using high- and low-tech approaches short
of armed conflict to disrupt national politics]{.underline} and daily
life in Western democracies. **[Enhancing and coordinating resilience
across the alliance should be a goal of the strategic
concept]{.underline}**. Third, money remains the sinew of war. Whether
it is investment in national and common-funded capabilities, or
transfers to partners like Ukraine, ample and efficient spending is a
requirement for a successful strategy. Fourth, NATO should continue to
grapple with the distinct but related challenges of terrorism and
irregular warfare.

DON'T LET RUSSIA DOMINATE THE STRATEGIC CONCEPT; War on the Rocks;
https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/dont-let-russia-dominate-the-strategic-concept/

[A significant strategic concern for NATO allies is to avoid
precipitating a Russian-Chinese authoritarian alignment.]{.underline}
While Russia and China face distinct strategic challenges of their own
and their "unlimited partnership" has appeared to stumble upon some
limits, [their continued pursuit of emerging]{.underline}, disruptive
[technologies]{.underline} and their authoritarian models of governance
[present significant risks to NATO allies. These models]{.underline},
coupled with Russia and China's shared willingness to undermine national
and international institutions in the trans-Atlantic community, [mean
that the most daunting threat NATO faces may be to its foundational
values.]{.underline} Incorporating these core values into strategy and
policy will be a key task for the 2022 Strategic Concept.¶ New Domains¶
Whether in coordination or not, [China and Russia will undoubtedly
continue to challenge allies in domains like space and cyber using
emerging]{.underline} and emerged [technologies]{.underline}. **[Dealing
with such challenges is core NATO business]{.underline}** --- grounded
in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty and resting primarily with
national authorities. **[The new Strategic Concept should aim to
integrate these relatively new domains]{.underline}** while responding
to disruptive technologies as well. [Allies must endeavor to reach a
"pre-crisis" consensus on what space and cyber actions would constitute
an "armed attack"]{.underline} in accordance with Article 5. **[This
kind of crisis decision-making is a core function of
NATO']{.underline}**s political and military headquarters. **[Such
agreement, when paired with improved national capabilities, would
contribute to deterrence by communicating resolve to
adversaries]{.underline}**. Improved capabilities themselves will only
arise through public-private partnership to maintain a technological
edge. [A common strategic culture of innovation]{.underline}, much of
which arises from the private sector, [is a key advantage that NATO
has]{.underline} --- and should retain --- [over its
adversaries]{.underline}. Such innovation has been on display in the
Russo-Ukrainian war and will doubtless be essential in future conflicts.

keep "our people safe", the [Alliance "must continue to **strengthen and
modernize** our **deterrence and defence**,"]{.underline} NATO
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at the Riga Summit on 30
November 2021. **[Innovation]{.underline}** plays a [**critical** role
in modernizing]{.underline} armed forces amid a complex strategic
environment. To this purpose, Stoltenberg unveiled the Defence
Innovation Accelerator for the [North Atlantic]{.underline} (DIANA) on
22 October 2021. DIANA shall [bring **defence and commercial companies**
together with military users to develop novel solutions]{.underline}
that meet the needs of the future battlefield. He also launched the
[NATO Innovation Fund to invest up to €1bn to support innovators
**developing emerging technologies**.]{.underline} The announcement
comes at a time when the Alliance is working on a new Strategic Concept.
[**Innovation** will be **key to preserving NATO's edge**]{.underline},
as the Secretary-General pointed out in his 2030 food for thought paper.
Although NATO is a potent defence organization, [emphasis on emerging
technologies]{.underline} reveals its Achilles' heel. Artificial
intelligence, autonomy, biotechnology, quantum technology, and other
technologies are at the heart of geoeconomic competition. Geoeconomic
competition unfolds around the projection of economic power within and
across the domains of land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace to achieve
political goals. Today's geoeconomic dynamic defines winning business
models amid a growing dichotomy between market-driven and state-driven
nations. It aims to set the rules, principles, and standards that guide
economic activities and access to and ownership of emerging
technologies. [**NATO's** current **emphasis** on **emerging
technologies**]{.underline} with defence and commercial applications
risks making the Alliance subject to this new geoeconomic dynamic. This
dynamic [can undermine **NATO's innovation agenda**]{.underline} and
[endanger its **strategic edge**]{.underline}. Therefore, NATO needs to
respond. First, NATO needs to embrace the realities of economic security
seriously. This call flows logically from Article 2 of the North
Atlantic Treaty, encouraging allies' economic collaborations. In our
view, economic security combines national security and economic policy
with technology and innovation policy to identify economic disruptions.
It also prevents these disruptions from arising and strengthens a coping
capacity to deal with economic emergencies. Economic security requires
allies, for example, to engage on defence-critical standards, advancing
transparency for defence supply chains, and considering the interplay
between technology development, foreign direct investment, and export
control. Therefore, the new Strategic Concept should incorporate
economic security as an essential element. Second, economic security
requires NATO to shape mindsets about defence investments and
sustainability. Already today, defence companies face financial
challenges as banks cancel bank accounts or refrain from covering export
risks. The emphasis on environmental, social, and governance criteria
(ESG) that increasingly shapes and determines financial investments will
reinforce these problems as defence is considered toxic. But a narrow
interpretation of ESG that considers defence incompatible with the world
view underpinning ESG is detrimental to NATO's ambition to invest in
companies. It also means other investors will likely shy away from
investing in the same companies. Therefore, the Alliance needs to step
up activities with the European Commission, which works on a
classification system to identify ESG-compliant activities, to make
defence investments compatible. Third, business is the first line of
defence in a geoeconomic world, and NATO needs a platform to discuss
geoeconomics with business. Today, the [NATO Industry Forum is the
leading gathering to address defence industrial matters with defence
companies.]{.underline} However, the [emphasis on emerging
technologies]{.underline} underlines the [importance]{.underline} of
non-defence companies. Therefore, NATO should envisage a new special
format of the North Atlantic Council to meet with the NATO Industry
Forum members -- and possibly also the European Commission -- to allow
state and corporate leaders to jointly engage on the proposed economic
security agenda. Fourth, strategic-level public-private dialogue also
breathes new life into deepening cooperation with the private sector.
NATO should become an early adopter of the solutions developed with
allied money. Making NATO the launch customer sends important market
signals and provides companies with an initial track record confirming
the relevance of their solutions. In addition, the Alliance should step
up efforts to incorporate business into military operations. Logistics
companies already play a crucial role, and traditional defence
businesses provide frontline support. The next stage comes with closely
integrating digital companies to leverage their contribution. But for
non-defence companies to provide frontline support, NATO not only needs
the right mindset, but the Alliance also needs to think about incentives
such as covering personnel risks on overseas deployments. Finally,
NATO's ability to stimulate innovation and ensure economic security also
depends on how it does business. Critically, NATO needs to strive for a
mission and capabilities-based innovation portfolio that maximises the
value of allied money. NATO may take a page from the financial services
industry and use a real options approach to manage technological risk
and drive technology development. This approach prices technology
building blocks like financial options, advances risk mitigation, speeds
up technology adoption and gives force planners and developers more
leeway to maximise input and output. In addition, NATO should offer
strategic hedging solutions for defence critical raw materials by
combining corporate demand estimates with AI-based insights on financial
and raw material markets. This will facilitate optimal, company-tailored
hedging strategies to mitigate the corporate security of supply and
price risks. Overall, [**NATO's** relevance in the 21st century remains
**tackling defence challenges** in a new strategic environment,
increasingly **defined by emerging** and rapidly changing
**technologies** and the profoundly important role of the **private
sector**. To this purpose, **NATO has embraced innovation and emerging
technologies**]{.underline}. This step, however, makes NATO subject to a
new geoeconomic dynamic that unfolds around competition for standards,
business models, technologies, and supply chains. This requires NATO to
make economic security a core element of its new Strategic Concept to
ensure NATO's edge. In turn, this will provide a sound basis for
expanded cooperation with the European Union, and make NATO an esteemed
partner of the new Transatlantic Trade and Technology Council, the new
body set up to enhance the EU-U.S. technology, economic, and trade
partnership.

### NATO Deterrence Fails- Underfunded

#### No NATO Deterrence- underfunding

Fellow Board Director Former Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Affairs; Senior Vice President and Director

lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war; Atlantic Council;\]

As a starting point, it is important to recognize that [almost all NATO
nations]{.underline}, other than the United States,
[have]{.underline}---in the words of a recent European Union (EU)
analysis---[had "years of defence underspending, which has led
to]{.underline} an accumulation of [gaps and shortfalls in]{.underline}
the collective [military" capabilities]{.underline}.1 Most importantly
in the context of the current environment, the "capacity to operate
full-spectrum and at high intensity was neglected."2 That neglect, and
the concomitant need to focus on reestablishing the capacity for
high-intensity battle, is well recognized by NATO military leaders. For
example, France's "Strategic Vision of the Chief of Defense Staff"
specifically sets forth the requirement to be able to "respond...in a
high-intensity conflict."3 Yet, as a recent RAND report stated: France's
capacity to sustain a high-end, conventional conflict nonetheless is
limited. [The French military]{.underline} might be able to accomplish
all its assigned missions at once, but it [lacks depth]{.underline},
meaning that [such demand]{.underline}ing operations [would quickly
exhaust both its human and material resources]{.underline}." [What is
true for France is similarly true for other European
militaries]{.underline}, including---perhaps most
importantly---[Germany]{.underline}, which [has suffered from years of
underspending and strategic neglect]{.underline}. In addition, while
operating at a different scale in terms of resources and reach, [the US
military itself is insufficiently prepared]{.underline}, in particular,
in terms of its munitions and supply inventories for a sustained,
high-intensity conflict. However, these deficiencies are entirely
remediable if appropriate measures are taken. The initial requirement
for success in high-intensity conflict is, of course, simply to have
sufficient weapons and support available. [The EU analysis includes the
need to "\[r\]eplenish stockpiles" among the "most urgent capability
gaps]{.underline}."4 Taking lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war, those
stockpiles should include anti-armor capabilities and man-portable and
medium-range air defenses, each of which adds to the maneuver capability
and lethality of ground units. Additionally, unmanned aerial vehicles
for both sensing and attack and long-range fires have proved to be key
battlefield weapons, and air defenses for rear areas are also critical.
Finally, inventories of precision-guided munitions for air forces need
to be substantially increased. All of the foregoing should be undertaken
in the context of a potential conflict that, as the Russia-Ukraine war
has demonstrated, can extend for multiple months---and perhaps even
years. So, inventories and replenishment capacities need to be
established with such a timeframe in mind. NATO should utilize the
defense planning process to set the necessary targets. There should be
no doubt, however, that [achieving the requisite level of capability
will require significant defense-budget increases, as the gap has been
very substantial.]{.underline} As the EU analysis states: [Had all
Member States spent 2% of their GDP on defence with 20% dedicated to
investment, since 2006 until 2020, this would have resulted in an
additional]{.underline} approximately [EUR 1,100 billion for
defence]{.underline}, of which [around EUR 270 billion on
investment."]{.underline} As that analysis makes clear[, just meeting
NATO's 2-percent defense-spending goal will not be sufficient to resolve
the substantial readiness and sustainment deficiencies in any reasonable
timeframe]{.underline}. To be sure, the 2-percent goal is important, but
NATO needs to establish an additional readiness/sustainment initiative
over a shorter period---perhaps three or four years---that would
substantially increase the readiness of national forces. The large
increases in Germany's investment budget provide a model for a budgetary
approach that should be undertaken by other countries. Germany has
promised to reach 2 percent annually, including by spending one hundred
billion euros over a four-year period on investment.5 Other countries
should follow the German approach and establish special
investment-funding streams focused on readiness and sustainability that
would be designed to resolve the shortfalls in a three-to-four-year
period. Along with the funding increases, and as an additional part of a
NATO readiness/sustainment effort, the Supreme Allied Commander for
Europe (SACEUR) should be given the task (and authority) to review and
report on the readiness of the forces that will be called upon in the
event of a contingency. A focused effort on readiness and
sustainability, generated through the defense-planning process and
overseen by the SACEUR, will significantly enhance NATO's deterrent and
defense posture.
