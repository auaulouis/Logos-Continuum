Cycles of racism in orthodox international relations theory

[The core point is that [**racism** is a **shapeshifter**]{.mark} in
that [its]{.mark} outward **[expression]{.mark}** or modality
**[changes]{.mark}** over time [while its]{.mark} underlying
**[structure remains]{.mark}** the same.]{.underline} Before 1945 both
scientific racism and 'manifest' cultural racism focused explicitly on
race as a core category, while after 1945 race disappears from
international relations theory's gaze and its conceptual repertoire. In
particular, 1945 is conventionally viewed as the watershed moment when
international relations jettisoned scientific and manifest cultural
racism. In this narrative, the West's ensuing 'colonial racist guilt
syndrome' prompted the social sciences to 'make amends' by replacing the
dark old racist Weltanschauung with a bright new non-racist worldview in
which the post-1945 [**[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline} discipline [[came to embrace a
**value-free**, **positivistic** posture through which]{.mark} the
pernicious phenomena of [**racial hatred** and **imperialism** are
**thought** to have been]{.mark} finally and mercifully
[exorcized]{.mark}. [But the reality saw]{.mark} the creation of
[a]{.mark} brave [new worldview in which]{.mark} **explicit racism**
([**scientific** and **manifest**]{.mark} **cultural
[racism]{.mark}**)]{.underline} indeed died out in the halls of the
academy and [[were **replaced**]{.underline}]{.mark} not by 'non-racist
cultural pluralism' but [[by **subliminal cultural-racist
monism**]{.underline}]{.mark} that appears on first blush as socially
acceptable given that it no longer talks about race and its associated
tropes (Hobson, 2012: 185--186, 319--322). [[Thus]{.mark}, in subliminal
cultural racism, Western [academics did]{.mark} indeed [distance
themselves from]{.mark} the old [explicit **racist tropes** but
**reaffirmed** them in **whitewashed terms**]{.mark} that dare not speak
their name.]{.underline}

[Thus, '[white supremacism]{.mark}' [was replaced by]{.mark} the core
modus operandi of **[Western universalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} (a.k.a.
'Western superiority') [and, albeit implicitly, **white normality**;
[racial hierarchy]{.mark} alongside]{.underline} the racial standard of
civilization were [replaced [by]{.mark} the proxies of
**[cultural-institutional hierarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the
Western market standard of civilization; ['[civilization versus
barbarism]{.mark}/savagery' was replaced [by]{.mark}]{.underline}
'tradition versus modernity' or ['**[developed versus
undeveloped]{.mark}**]{.underline} economies'; 'barbaric Oriental
despotisms' morphed into the tropes of 'rogue states' and the 'axis of
evil' on the basis that such states would not reciprocate according to
the 'civilized norms' of (Western) international law and (Western-based)
'international society', while 'savage anarchies' morphed into 'failed
states' on the basis that they could not reciprocate. And last, but not
least, [the old colonial [denial of non-Western]{.mark} state
[sovereignty]{.mark} was replaced [by]{.mark} the construct of
'**[conditional sovereignty]{.mark}**' in the postcolonial era, while
[imperial intervention]{.mark} was replaced [by]{.mark} ([the]{.mark}
'**[civilizing mission]{.mark}**' [of]{.mark}) **[US
hegemony]{.mark}**,]{.underline} intervention by international financial
institutions and humanitarian intervention.

Accordingly, orthodox international relations scholars have mistaken the
shift from explicit racism to subliminal cultural racism for one that
marks the transition from racism to non-racist, value-free 'scientific
positivism'. Critical race theorists view this transition as one in
which cultural difference masquerades as tolerant cultural pluralism but
that, in reality, is 'racism in disguise' (Balibar, 1991; Barker, 1981;
Bonilla-Silva, 2018; Henderson, 2013; Hunt, 1987; McCarthy, 2009; Miles,
1993; Omi and Winant, 2014; Perry, 2007; Salter, 2002; Vitalis, 2000,
2015). Thus, speaking of the post-1945 substitution of cultural
difference for racial difference, Richard Perry (2007: 216) concludes
that ['the terms may change, perhaps giving the impression that the old
\[racial\] problems have disappeared, when in fact they have merely
acquired protective coloration through **semantic
camouflage**'.]{.underline} Or, again, ['[the demise of **scientific
racism**]{.mark} in its evolutionary-biological form [did not mean the
end of **racist thinking**]{.mark} in scholarly discourse
altogether.]{.underline} A new, post-biological modality of neo-racism
is now widespread in social science' (McCarthy, 2009: 91). This cultural
modality has also been termed 'racism lite' or 'colour-blind racism'
(Bonilla-Silva, 2018).

Thus, the evolution of international relations theory has mirrored the
generic shifts in the practice of racism in everyday life and in world
politics given that the discipline's racism has been hidden behind a
non-racist mask after 1945. [[Unmasking]{.mark} modern
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations theory
[reveals]{.mark} its emphasis on [**cultural difference** as a proxy
for]{.mark} non-white racial inferiority and **[white]{.mark}** Western
**[superiority]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Thus, white international
relations theorists often wear a 'non-racist mask' in order to make
their cultural-racist theories appear socially palatable in the
so-called cultural-pluralist postcolonial era. Accordingly, [all that
has really changed since 1945 is that the old racist Jim Crow laws that
international theory originally conceptualized became sublimated or
'**hidden in plain sight**']{.underline} (Henderson, 2013; Rutazibwa,
2020; Vitalis, 2000), [having morphed into the 'New (subliminal) Jim
Crow laws' of modern analyses of the global economy/interstate
system.]{.underline} Uncovering this long-temporal passage that links
the past with the present means that the discipline has a fabricated
detachment with the racist ghosts of its past (as Bryony Vince put it to
me in private conversation). What, then, of the racist double move that
modern orthodox international relations theories perform when analysing
world politics/global political economy?

Revealing the racist double move of orthodox international relations
theory

[The giveaway concerning the **racist foundations** of modern
**i**nternational **r**elations theory lies not simply in what it does
say but as much in what it does not.]{.underline} Thus, to
postcolonialism's rhetorical question as to whether racism has played an
important role in structuring world politics past and present, the
orthodox reply is simply 'nothing to see here'. [[This first racist
move]{.mark}, which evacuates and [**whitewashes** the]{.mark} presence
of [racism in world politics]{.mark}]{.underline} past and present, [[is
complemented by the second, in which]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations theory [advances]{.mark} a [**racist analysis**
of world politics]{.mark}/global political economy but [in]{.mark}
subliminal **[cultural language]{.mark}** that appears as value-free and
'racially neutral'.]{.underline} To illustrate this double move, I shall
draw on examples from my current research (Hobson and Odijie,
forthcoming) and from elsewhere.

The neorealist vision of the Cold War comprises a Western zone of
relative peace and stability that ensues from bipolarity or US hegemony
or the logic of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). But such ['**[peace
and stability]{.mark}**' [was only]{.mark} rendered [possible because
of]{.mark} the [racist decision by]{.mark} the [superpowers to
**outsource war** to the]{.mark} '**inferior**' and expendable
'**wastelands**' of the **[Global South]{.mark}**, which constituted a
safety valve that could prevent direct nuclear conflict from erupting
between the USA and the USSR. Thus, 'it appears that [cold war history
has a concentric]{.mark} conceptual [organization, consisting of]{.mark}
a "formal" history of relative [**peace** in the **center** and]{.mark}
"informal" [**violence** in the **periphery**]{.mark}**'**]{.underline}
(Kwon, 2010: 155; see also Persaud, 2016). Moreover, 'in a historical
sense -- and especially when seen from the South -- the Cold War was a
continuation of colonialism through slightly different means. . . For
the Third World, the continuum of which the Cold War forms a part did
not start in 1945, or even 1917, but in 1878 -- with the \[Congress\] of
Berlin that divided Africa between European imperialist powers' (Westad,
2007: 396). This Western neo-imperialism also takes us back to the
future of America's racist-colonial drive in the 19th and early 20th
centuries (see Go, 2011; Hunt, 1987). [But [all of this]{.mark}
necessarily [flies under **neorealism's**]{.mark} ontological
[radar]{.mark} scanner [given its **evacuation** of **social process**
through]{.mark} its reification of the structural logic of
**[anarchy]{.mark}** that is [coupled with the]{.mark} deployment of the
Eurocentric/racist method of '**[analytical bifurcation]{.mark}'**,
[wherein **racist-imperial processes** are **bracketed out**]{.mark} and
**silenced** [in favour of]{.mark} focusing solely on [intra-**Western
white activities**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Go, 2016: 89--92, 104--110).

This first move is complemented by neorealism's second, wherein a
subliminal cultural-racist theory is applied to analysing world
politics. Notable here is that European empires constituted subsystems
hierarchies in which the dominant hyper-sovereign colonial power stood
atop of the colonies that were denied sovereignty. But Waltz's
[[reification of]{.mark} **international [anarchy]{.mark}** [is triply
problematic]{.mark}, **[first]{.mark}** because [this]{.mark} conception
[replicates the]{.mark} old [**scientific-racist** conception of]{.mark}
'**[tropical anarchy]{.mark}**']{.underline} (Henderson, 2013; Sampson,
2002; compare Lynch, 2019: 277); [[second]{.mark}, because Waltz
**[sanitizes]{.mark}** or evacuates **[hierarchy]{.mark}** from world
politics, thereby [conjuring]{.mark} Western **[colonialism]{.mark}**
and its practices of **[genocide]{.mark}**, [the]{.mark} Atlantic
**[slave trade]{.mark}**, **[land]{.mark}** appropriation [and **labour
exploitation**]{.mark} together with its neo-imperialist successor [into
**thin air**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hobson, 2012: 203--208; Sabaratnam,
2020); [[and, **third**]{.mark}, Waltz's [claim that]{.mark} sovereign
[states are]{.mark} the [dominant]{.mark} form of polity under modern
anarchy [is undermined by the]{.mark} presence of **[colonial
hierarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline} before the very recent era of
decolonization [[wherein the only]{.mark} **sovereign [states]{.mark}**
that existed [were **Western**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Accordingly,
Waltz's move serves to let Western imperialism off the moral hook,
thereby [[reflecting an]{.mark} '**[epistemology of
ignorance]{.mark}**']{.underline} (Sabaratnam, 2020: 20--21; see also
Mills, 2007). Interestingly, we find an evacuation and naturalization of
Western empire in the classical realist work of Hans Morgenthau (Hobson,
2012: 188--190; Salter, 2002: 117) and other realists, which leads
Nicolas Guilhot (2014) to talk of 'imperial realism'.

By contrast, Robert Gilpin's neorealist hegemonic stability theory
embraces a normative (direct) imperialism that is dressed up in terms
that dare not speak its name (Hobson, 2012: 193--203). Gilpin (1987)
differentiates hegemons from empires, where the latter exploit
non-Western states while the former help them through the hegemon's
self-sacrificial provision of global public goods. [But the
**[paternalist]{.mark}** sign of **[US]{.mark} hierarchical
[hegemony]{.mark}** is that it [supposedly **uplifts states** around the
world]{.mark}, with East Asian states singled out as the most egregious
and **ungrateful free riders** that benefit most from hegemonic
largesse.]{.underline} Thus, what Gilpin misses is that [[the conception
of uplift reconvenes Britain's]{.mark} paternalist-**[imperial
civilizing mission]{.mark}** of the 19th century,]{.underline} though
this elision is inevitable given that he re-visions the British Empire
as a benign liberal hegemon. Significantly, Niall Ferguson (2004)
effectively reconvenes Gilpin's argument, though he talks explicitly
about the benign liberal imperialism of Britain and America. Moreover,
[this benign conception that reflects an **epistemology of ignorance**
effectively boils off the coercive side of empire in the subliminal
cultural-racist distillation process, thereby [providing]{.mark} an
[**apologia** for]{.mark} Anglo-Saxon
**[imperialism]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Similar cultural [**racist logics** play out in
**liberalism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Hobson, 2012: 216--222,
285--310). While the normative (direct) imperialist posture that is
found in John Rawls's (1999) The Law of Peoples is a very obvious
example (Hobson, 2012: 292--295), nevertheless the hard test-case here
is that of neoliberal institutionalism. [The received wisdom is that
[**neoliberal institutionalism** presents a]{.mark} genuinely
'**[universal]{.mark}**' picture or flattened [ontology of]{.mark} all
[**states** learning to **cooperate**]{.mark} in order to enhance their
gains.]{.underline} But it turns out that, in After Hegemony, Keohane
(1984) confines this process to Western states (as did Norman Angell
before him). [Moreover, absent here is a historical-sociological
analysis that would reveal the **[hierarchical-imperial
contexts]{.mark}** that [have driven]{.mark} both **[Western
unity]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sabaratnam, 2020: 25) [[and the **global
process** by which **unequal gains** accrue]{.mark} to the West at the
expense of the non-West.]{.underline} Paradoxically, constructivists
critique neoliberal institutionalism for its rational actor model by
asserting that interests are not a priori but are formed through
socialization. However, a close reading of Keohane's book reveals that
it is Western norms and identity that socialize Western states into
cooperating (Keohane, 1984: 5--7, 43, 182). Accordingly, Keohane not
only looks specifically at Western states as the successful actors, but
argues that they take specifically Western cultural values such as
democracy and liberal capitalism to the table before they enter iterated
prisoner's dilemma games (Keohane, 1984: 182).

One of several (direct) neo-imperialist cues in Keohane's work emerges
from his approval of US hegemonic intervention and intervention by
international financial institutions in the Global South as a means of
extending complex interdependence across the world. But here the
[international financial institutions act as paternalist **neo-imperial
vehicles** for the **cultural conversion** of non-Western states along
Western neoliberal capitalist lines via the imposition of neoliberal
conditionality and structural adjustment programmes.]{.underline}
Moreover, the notorious resentment that these programmes have invoked in
many non-Western states, all of which disappears in Keohane's analysis,
takes us back to the future of the 'unequal treaties' that emerged under
Britain's informal imperialism in the 19th century, much as the
paternalist role of the international financial institutions finds its
historical parallel with the League of Nations Mandate System (Anghie,
2005: 245--272). And, finally, Keohane's approval of Anglo-Saxon
hegemony in the 19th and 20th centuries returns us to the problems that
I discussed above vis-a-vis hegemonic stability theory (see also
Sabaratnam, 2020: 18--19).

A notable example of an indirect imperialist approach is found in the
neoliberal theory of globalization, which rehabilitates the classical
liberalism of Adam Smith and his aversion to empire (e.g. Friedman,
2000). But there are three subliminal neo-imperialist cues here, the
first comprising Friedman's (2000: 101--111) argument that non-Western
states have no choice but to 'don the golden straitjacket', which
requires them to adopt Western neoliberal-capitalist architectures.
[Having to become Western means that the theory smuggles **informal
imperialism** in through the **backdoor** of its Western universalism.
Second, by subscribing to the ontological proposition that '**the world
is flat**']{.underline} (Friedman, 2007), [the neoliberal theory of
globalization conjures Western imperial/neo-imperial hierarchy and
racial capitalism into thin air, thereby **naturalizing** rather than
problematizing these phenomena via the **epistemology of white
ignorance**.]{.underline} And, third, because Friedman focuses on
rational individuals whose interests are a priori and whose social
identity is irrelevant to individual behaviour, racism and racialized
capitalism are whitewashed from the global economy.

Surely constructivism fares much better given its ability to highlight
international racial norms? Not only has much of it ignored racism in
world politics but the few constructivists who have considered it argue
that racism was left behind in world politics after 1945 (Finnemore,
2003; Klotz, 1995), much as imperialism was supposedly outlawed by the
UN in 1960. This [[**whitewashing** of racism]{.mark} and imperialism
from modern world politics not only reflects the illusion that
subliminal cultural racism projects but is also a vital move because it
[allows **liberal constructivists** to portray Western]{.mark}
humanitarian [**interventionism** and]{.mark} liberal
**[peacebuilding]{.mark}**/state-building [as a
**non-racist**]{.mark}/non-imperial project that saves oppressed
non-Western peoples.]{.underline} It is here that we encounter a
subliminal cultural-racist paternalism that presents the West as the
white saviour of the inferior non-Western societies -- [thereby
**[rehabilitating]{.mark}** the 19th-century conception of [the **white
man's burden** and]{.mark} the **[civilizing
mission]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- and where the West is (re)presented as
the altruistic paternalist father of the non-West (Hobson, 2012:
302--305). [Moreover, [in this]{.mark} **liberal [imaginary of
ignorance]{.mark}**[, the notion that
**peacebuilding**]{.mark}/state-building [is initiated as a means of
**eradicating** the]{.mark} threat of the deviant non-Western [Other
**disappears**]{.mark} from view, [as does the legacy of]{.mark}
**Western [empire]{.mark}** [that created]{.mark} some of [the]{.mark}
**core [problems]{.mark}** in non-Western states [that prompted
intervention]{.mark} in the first place]{.underline} (for further
postcolonial critiques of liberal constructivism, see Sabaratnam, 2020;
Sampson, 2002; Vitalis, 2000).

[**Liberal constructivism** buys into the cultural-racist idea that all
progressive actions in the world are initiated by the **universal West**
'on behalf of **global humanity**'. For example, it is the benign West
that has single-handedly brought human rights to the world]{.underline}
via the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Here international
relations' 'non-racist mask' slips conspicuously, given that the Western
great powers did their utmost at the United Nations to keep human rights
off the global agenda for fear of diluting white supremacy and white
normality in world politics and within Western societies. For it was
various non-Western delegates at the UN that pursued human rights most
fervently while their Western counterparts mobilized the defensive
prerogative of sovereign independence to insulate their states from
future criticism given that [**human rights** were **denied** to
minorities within their constituent societies, particularly **native
Americans** and black **African Americans** in the United States. Thus,
Western racist motivations and the progressive role of non-Western
agency in advancing the cause of human rights in world politics have
been airbrushed out of the liberal-constructivist picture.]{.underline}
And, in turn, [this serves to retain the chimera of the purely
**progressive non-racist West** and the **regressive
non-West**.]{.underline} Equally as egregious is that the role of the
West in the denial of human rights to non-Western peoples in the first
place is somehow written out of the narrative. Still, much of this is
perhaps unavoidable given that liberal-constructivist international
relations tends ontologically to divorce power from norms in world
politics and epistemologically segregates power from knowledge.

Are orthodox scholars intentionally racist? Racist impact over intention

The case for intentionality is that it is no coincidence that the shift
from scientific racism to subliminal cultural racism in orthodox
international relations/international political economy theory mirrored
the trajectory of racism in everyday life and world politics. My hunch,
though, is that international relations theory's racism is unintentional
given that the overwhelming majority of orthodox international relations
scholars are most probably non-racist (but not anti-racist) in their
private lives. But [orthodox **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations [scholars have **mistaken** a critique of]{.mark}
their implication in [**structural racism** for]{.mark} an allegation of
[interpersonal racism. This **epistemology** of]{.mark},]{.underline} or
move to, [[**innocence** links]{.mark} directly [to the
**self-deluded**]{.mark} heart of the [orthodoxy]{.mark}.]{.underline}
For there are all manner of built-in cloaking devices that mask the
racism and whiteness of orthodox international relations theories from
the eyes of their advocates. [**[I]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elation[s']{.mark} '**[non-racist mask]{.mark}**'
[has]{.mark} at least **[four]{.mark}** mystificatory
[layers]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [first]{.mark} layer]{.underline} (or cloaking device) [[is that
racism in]{.mark} orthodox **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations/international political economy theory
[is]{.mark} manifested in [**cultural** rather than
**biological**]{.mark} terms,]{.underline} thereby appearing as
outwardly non-racist (given the mistaken popular belief that racism is
inherently biological). [[The second]{.mark} layer of mystification [is
that **cultural racism** takes on a]{.mark} hidden or **[subliminal
guise]{.mark}**]{.underline} (which exorcizes race as an ontological
category from world politics), thereby making such racism much harder to
detect. [Aggregating these two layers together leads white
**i**nternational **r**elations/international political economy scholars
to buy into the self-deluded rhetoric that their theories are
**racist-free**.]{.underline} Pertinent here is Blaut's (1992: 296)
characterization of the social sciences since 1950 as 'so much
\[subliminal cultural\] racism yet so few racists' (see also Memmi,
\[1982\] 2000: 3).

[This mystification is ultimately secured by the [third]{.mark} layer of
the mask that [constitutes the problem of]{.mark}]{.underline}
~~blindness to~~ [**[white privilege]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For not
being on the end of racism's pernicious effects means that, unlike
non-whites, many white academics tend quite naturally to downplay its
existence (see Lake, 2016). An obvious example of this lies with the
everyday performance of driving from A to B. For the vast majority of
white drivers are able to travel safe in the knowledge that they will
not be stopped by the police unless they have been unlucky enough to
have been caught breaking the speed limit. By contrast, many black
drivers consider themselves lucky if they are not stopped by the police
when they have respected the speed limit. Such ~~blindness to~~
[\[[**ignorance** of]{.mark}\] [**white privilege** feeds]{.mark}
directly [into the **unreflexive** propensity to **deny** the]{.mark}
presence of [**whiteness** and **racism** in]{.mark} both the theory and
practice of orthodox **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations/international political economy]{.underline}
(Peterson, 2021; Sabaratnam, 2020: 5). For the ingeniousness of white
privilege is that it renders such privilege invisible. Thus, [[white
people are]{.mark} effectively [taught **not to notice** racism]{.mark}
and their role in reproducing it]{.underline} (McIntosh, 2020).
[[Which]{.mark}, in turn, [fuels the tendency]{.mark} of the privileged
[to **reject**]{.mark}, if not **protest** vehemently, [the
**accusation** of racism]{.mark} in the social sciences]{.underline} --
as in the aforementioned spat between Pankaj Mishra and Niall Ferguson
(see Mishra, 2011). All of which undermines the prospect of addressing,
let alone redressing, the problem at stake.

Thus, while [[a]{.mark} fifth great [debate concerning the]{.mark}
Eurocentric [racism of]{.mark} orthodox **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations/international political economy is long overdue,
unfortunately the chances of it [**occurring** are
**slim**]{.mark}]{.underline} to zero. This is partly because
intradisciplinary dialogue between international relations' orthodox and
critical wings has completely broken down (De Carvalho et al., 2011),
and partly [[because]{.mark} a simmering '**[white silence]{.mark}**'
[of **denial** is the **most likely**]{.mark}
**'[response]{.mark}'**]{.underline} (see, Ryde, 2019; Saad, 2020).
Strikingly, it is now some two decades since Robert Vitalis (2000) wrote
his seminal article, but still the tumbleweed of white silence blows
deafeningly past my window. However, were an explicit response to be
forthcoming, two entwined paradoxes might emerge here, the first being
that it would most likely accuse my argument of being angry, hysterical
and outlandish, wherein 'Eurocentrism' is deemed to be the calm/rational
'standard of common sense' -- the paradox being that rather than
engaging with the substance of my critique, such a response would likely
comprise an angry ad hominem attack on the accuser and the journal for
publishing such an article. And the second paradox is that while most
orthodox scholars abhor 'cancel culture', it turns out that engaging in
an ad hominem attack serves merely to shut down debate on this vital
issue. That is, an ad hominem attack on the accuser is merely another
form of cancel culture. [Still, both such 'responses' would reinforce my
argument given that '**[white silence]{.mark}**', '**white
[rage]{.mark}**' [and]{.mark} '**white [denial]{.mark}**' [are
manifestations of]{.mark} **white [privilege]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see
Ryde, 2019; Saad, 2020: 40--45; Sabaratnam, 2020; Peterson, 2021).

[A [fourth]{.mark} cloaking device [is that]{.mark} pre-1945 orthodox
international [theory has been]{.mark} put through an ahistorical
deracination laundering process to reappear in **[whitewashed]{.mark}
form**, fit for consumption in the 'cultural pluralist' post-1945
era.]{.underline} And because post-1945 international relations theory
is (re)presented as non-racist so the laundering of its pre-1945
predecessor means that international theory in the last three centuries
is (re)presented as universally racist-free. [[In this
**sleight-of-hand**]{.mark} manoeuvre, [the **racist underpinnings**
of]{.mark} pre-1945 [**liberal** and **realist theories** are]{.mark}
filtered out or [**conjured away**, leaving only]{.mark} their claims
about states or geopolitics or interdependence that are transmogrified
into '**[objective universalist]{.mark}**'
**[propositions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the liberal pantheon, two
examples are pertinent. First is Norman Angell, who is (re)presented as
a key theorist of liberal interdependence and the peaceful benefits it
provides rather than as the paternalist-Eurocentric/cultural racist that
he was, given his fundamental belief in international hierarchy and the
positive need for the British Empire to promote harmonious global
interdependence by acting as the civilizer of the barbaric and savage
East (see Hobson, 2012: 40--45). Second is the reconstruction of Woodrow
Wilson, who is recast as the founding father of 20th-century progressive
liberal internationalism, based as 'it is' on anti-imperialism,
sovereignty and self-determination for all states rather than on what
'it was' -- a Lamarckian racist vision comprising a pro-Western
imperialist stance and a denial of non-Western state sovereignty that
was coupled with strong racial immigration controls and anti-black
initiatives at home (see Hobson, 2012: 167--175). Similarly, pre-1945
realists typically mentioned in international relations textbooks
include Alfred Mahan and Halford Mackinder and occasionally Nicholas
Spykman, all of whom are (re)presented as geopolitical-realist thinkers
that analysed spatial conceptions of world power rather than as
Lamarckian scientific racists who advocated Western imperialism to
contain the marauding 'barbaric' non-Western peril and whose mentor was
the scientific-racist thinker Friedrich Ratzel (see Hobson, 2012:
123--130, 156--158).

Critically, this laundering process extends across all aspects of
pre-1945 international relations. Thus, it becomes (but should no longer
be) a revelation to learn that early international relations was
primarily concerned about inter-racial relations; that the claim that
international relations emerged formally in 1919 with the noble desire
to solve the problem of war elides its earlier origins, which revolved
around maintaining white Western global supremacy and racist empire
together with the normative study of 'effective' colonial
administration; that the journal Foreign Affairs was originally called
the Journal of Race Development; and that the International Studies
Conference at the League of Nations, which set up the subject matter of
international relations in the 1930s under the leadership of Alfred
Zimmern, grounded its syllabi in normative Western imperialism and
racism (see Acharya and Buzan, 2019; Ashworth, 2014; Bell, 2016; De
Carvalho et al., 2011; Henderson, 2013; Hobson, 2012; Kristensen, 2021;
Long and Schmidt, 2005; Lynch, 2019; Schmidt, 1998; Schmidt and Guilhot,
2019; Thakur and Vale, 2019; Vitalis, 2000, 2005, 2015). [That orthodox
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations [scholars persist in
**ignoring** these arguments]{.mark} in the face of a now substantial
body of literature that has emerged over the last two decades means that
this [**pervading silence** can **no longer be
excused**]{.mark}]{.underline} as the product of an innocent 'historical
amnesia'. [Rather, [this silence points]{.mark} clearly [to the **white
denial** of]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elation[s']{.mark} **[racist origins]{.mark}** wherein the
non-racist mask slips most conspicuously, thereby constituting an actual
example of orthodox **i**nternational **r**elations' version of cancel
culture.]{.underline}

[However, except for in the above context, '**intentionality**' is **not
the issue** that the racist charge hinges upon]{.underline} given that
most international relations/international political economy theorists
are unintentionally racist. [[What matters]{.mark}, therefore, [is
**racist** impact **regardless of intention**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And
to conclude this article more generally, it would be folly to presume
that if only the Eurocentric rather than the racist charge were levied
against the orthodox mainstream then 'all would not be lost'. For the
E-word cannot be used as a 'get out of racist jail free' card.

Given this, what would it mean to re-imagine the study of IR in a way
that attempted to overcome epistemologies of immanence, ignorance, and
innocence? While it is impossible to do justice here to the wide range
of traditions that have alternative starting points, as [scholars of IR
our priorities should be to (1) 'de-mythologise'121 and (2) 'de-centre'
this racialised standpoint. Both require a more sophisticated awareness
of epistemological situatedness, a better global-historical education
and a wider ethical and political vocabulary and universe. It requires
an alertness not just to the intellectual contours of Eurocentrism, but
the interlocking moral and epistemological consequences of White
subject-positioning.]{.underline} They may be animated by the
abolitionist principle that 'treason to Whiteness is loyalty to
humanity'.122 This principle does not build the grounds for a 'redeemed'
or 'modified' Whiteness but totally deconstructs it analytically and
ethically.

[A 'de-mythologising' strategy challenges epistemologies of immanence
and ignorance -- the specific racialised metahistorical narratives and
myths about the exceptional, vanguardist, and progressive character of
the 'West' and its peoples as a point of departure for building
international theory.]{.underline} Alternative accounts are already
available to us which emphasise the uneven but interconnected ways in
which the modern international system came to be. [These look at the
contributions of the 'non-West' to the rise of the 'West',123 the role
of transnational networks as drivers of development,124 the enduring
role of hierarchies as an organising principle of global order,125 the
colonial origins of sovereignty practices126 and the transnational
character of political thought.]{.underline}127 There is considerable
scope for more historically oriented work which excavates in particular
the relation between the 'colonial' and the 'modern.

Another way of 'de-mythologising' Whiteness in IR is **[to re-think the
discipline's constitutive distinction between 'war' and 'violence',
particularly where the coding of historical events into one or another
category have been as a result of racialised categorisations and
thinking about whose deaths count, thus enabling an epistemology of
'innocence'.]{.underline}**128 Withholding the assumption that 'war'
(meaning wars as recognised by and between Western powers) rather than
'violence' should be studied in IR -- as in peace studies, for
example129 [-- offers considerable scope for contemplating the rich web
of interconnections and entanglements that constitute the international
system, and particularly its colonial, imperial and racialised
inheritances]{.underline}. [It is a particularly productive point of
departure for conceiving of questions of consent and sovereignty under
radical inequalities of power globally, and potential shared forms of
theorising among feminist approaches,130 critical environmentalisms,131
Indigenous political thought,132 and so on. ']{.underline}

[De-centring' Whiteness means not only a regional expansion of IR's gaze
but more profoundly a re-locating of its intellectual and ethical centre
of gravity away from its stories of 'immanence' and
'innocence'.]{.underline} One way of doing this might be, as Wynter
does, to [re-centre Blackness as the starting point for the embrace of
the 'human' in all its multiple potentialities, given that Blackness has
been historically overdetermined by experiences and epistemes which
locate it at the underside of humanity.]{.underline}133 [This radical
shaking-up of IR's epistemological orientations would be particularly
productive in dismantling]{.underline} the limits identified here. This
could connect them to forms of worldly politics rooted in experiences of
diasporic connectivity and suffering, and creativity and solidarity.134
These signal different **[sites of sovereignty, rights, borders, and
power,135 and open up questions of historical injustice, responsibility,
and reparations.]{.underline}** It could conceive of more 'conventional'
IR theory that began with African presence rather than absence.136
Finally[, working with and through Blackness would give an important
corrective to debates on the 'post-human' which have not always
contemplated the racialisation of humanity in depth.]{.underline}137
**[The point here is not simply to 'replace' White-centredness with
Black-centredness as part of historical justice -- but through
re-positioning to reveal what has been obscured about the organisation
of authority, relationality, rights, obligations, materiality, and
knowledge.]{.underline}**

[Would the kind of **IR** theory examined here **be possible** with such
starting points**?** **Absolutely**. A research programme focused on
'**Great Powers**' would still be possible but be explicitly a study of
**empires** and other polities across time and space. It would have to
**embrace** rather than ignore their internal **diversities** and forms
of **interconnectedness**]{.underline} -- [overall, this might lead to
an **abandonment** of the '**anarchy**' problematique in favour of a
more positive historical appreciation of diverse forms of authority and
**sociality**.]{.underline} For a research programme interested in
international co-operation, it would have to take a wider understanding
of the kinds of co-operation which are possible, the kinds of political
purposes that they underpin, and the forms of exclusion, collusion, and
expropriation which are likely involved in setting them up. This would
make it impossible to study 'institutions' or 'organisations' among
powerful actors in a way which is disembedded from their political
foundations. Similarly, for a research programme interested in the
emergence of forces of socialisation and collective identification, much
more attention would need to be paid to the political context and
drivers of particular forms of sociality and the kinds of coercion
enabled by productions of Otherness. All such projects would be informed
by that spirit of hermeneutic suspicion with which writers not
racialised as White have often greeted projections of Western
civilisation.

[However, it is up to the field as a whole to uphold standards of rigour
which make the persistence of **racialised ignorance**, immanence, and
**innocence impossible**.]{.underline} What has happened over the last
several decades has been a continued asymmetry in the practice of our
'science', such that the profound epistemological challenges presented
for the field in a range of critical writing have been sidelined through
practices of training and citation which together reproduce a White
subject-position in the discipline. The vast bulk of references to ToIP,
AH, and SToIP continue to treat them as authoritative texts. This is an
institutional problem more than an epistemological one in many respects
and one that is unlikely to be solved in the near future, or at least by
this generation. [**Identifying** the logics constitutive of
**Whiteness** in **IR** theory is a necessary step towards institutional
change, but no more than that. In the absence of this change, IR theory
will continue to be White.]{.underline}

We argue that **[[knowledge]{.mark} cumulation [in IR is a fantasy
reified by]{.mark} paradigmatic clusters and the [mimicry of research
standards]{.mark}]{.underline}** and practices **[in the natural
sciences]{.underline}** (e.g., Elman & Elman, 2001, 2003). The
**[["evidence"]{.underline}]{.mark}** of "knowledge cumulation" [in IR
[comes]{.mark} as much [from]{.mark} the [ritualized practice]{.mark} of
research behavior as it does from]{.underline} any "true" or
[genuine]{.underline} notion of [knowledge cumulation.]{.underline} One
has "succeeded" in the enterprise of IR by cumulating knowledge, and the
work of "successful" scholars is by definition cumulated knowledge.
Cumulation of knowledge as a standard of success is a condition of
possibility for the desirability of success in the field. [That
ritualized practice]{.underline} at once [is]{.underline}
institutionalized as success and institutionalizes the need for research
success, [reified and reproduced by hiring, tenure, merit raise, and
promotion standards.]{.underline}

[This ritualization is a signifier that what counts as knowledge in the
field]{.underline}, in particular research programs and more generally,
**[is performative]{.underline}** (Barad, 2007; Butler, 1990; Weber,
1998)---[where standards are set by their utterance and repetition
rather than by some external "objective" standards]{.underline} of
(narrowly) good science or (more broadly) good research (Baudrillard,
1991; Shepherd, 2008; Williams, 2003). [[Scholars]{.mark} iterate and
[reify standards]{.mark} of measurement of knowledge [in]{.mark} each
piece of [scholarship which "succeeds"]{.mark} in the field, and these
iterations make it a paradox for scholars to both occupy the
methodological, epistemological, and political space that falls outside
of inherited standards and succeed.]{.underline} Outside -the
-mainstream work's underrepresentation in the places understood to be
publishing "success" is overdetermined, and the correlation between
mimicry of traditional scholarship and "success" of critical scholars a
given.

We mean "performative" in the sense that Judith Butler uses it (Butler,
1990, 1993), particularly as she talks about it going hand in hand with
a Foucauldian notion of disciplining,8 where [["performativity cannot be
understood outside]{.mark} of a process of [iterability]{.mark}---a
regularized and constrained repetition of norms" [which resonate
as]{.mark} "ritualized production"]{.underline} (Butler, 1993, p. 60).
[This frames performativity as a "specific modality of [power]{.mark} as
discourse" (]{.underline}Butler, 1993, p. 139) where the politics of the
signification and the politics of the sign meet, an act of
territoralization, of production, of installation---which does not have
to be alone, singular, or unidirectional. Since performatives are their
own referent (Butler, 1993, p. 159), they proliferate as manifestations
of the power underlying them and interact relatively on the basis of
that relative power. In this context, "performances" are actions and
events, iterations and reifications, and context-specific, which "bring
a subject into being" relationally.9

[To escape the recursive]{.underline}, performative [loop of
**"disciplinary success,"** we argue that it is important to see the
possibility that knowledge cumulation is not, and should not be, a given
in IR research.]{.underline} Instead, we argue that the idea itself is
an inherited empty signifier with unspoken content which governs the
production of what we understand as disciplinary IR. Traditionally, the
idea of knowledge cumulation is firmly grounded in a neopositivist
understanding of social science, in which the role of theory is to
collate observed empirical regularities across cases or what Waltz calls
laws (Waltz, 1979). While this interpretation is critiqued in most
critical IR, "cumulation," in that work, becomes a term without clear
conceptual content. [The **paradigmatization of IR** theorizing
distracts from a particular theory's internal conditions of possibility
by introducing incompatible conditions of possibility drawn from an
inherited disciplinary sociology of what knowledge is and how it works.
As such, [any acknowledgment of]{.mark} the idea of cumulativity from
within specific exercises in [reflexive IR]{.mark} [creates the grounds
for **necessary failure**]{.mark} within those exercises.]{.underline}

The simultaneous rejection of traditional "cumulation" and continued
performance of acts of cumulation can be understood by seeing the ways
that **[[silence frames]{.mark} cumulation in critical
[IR.]{.mark}]{.underline}** We learn from feminist theorists that
**[[the unspoken]{.mark} is as important as if not more important than
what is spoken]{.underline}** (Charlesworth, 1999; Kronsell, 2006),
**[coming from attention to how IR's others are [omitted,
excluded]{.mark}, kept out, [and not mentioned]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Agathangelou & Ling, 2004; Tickner, 1988). We argue that IR's silences
tell us more about the state of knowledge cumulation in the discipline
than looking for standards that tell us what we do know. Accordingly, we
ask on principle what any given research program does not take account
of and how accounting for those omissions could changes analysis. We
focus on both [visible omissions (like the concepts that a research
program fails to incorporate) and invisible omissions.]{.underline}
Invisible omissions are [those that are unhearable by a research
program---]{.underline} normally left out or ignored by both the
researchers that form the core of the research program and their critics
(Butler, 2001; Edkins et al., 2012; Hansen, 2000). By "unhearable," we
mean either that the omitted content falls outside of the boundaries set
for dialog or is assumed by all stakeholders to be by definition
irrelevant (for deeper analyses see MacKinnon, 2006; Spivak, 1988).
Unlike its visible omissions---variables that its scholars and their
critics have added to, re-operationalized, expanded on, or suggested the
inclusion of---invisible omissions are often not treated as omissions at
all within particular scholarly boundaries.10

[The discipline's "collective" [standards]{.mark}]{.underline} for
knowledge production, then, [[can be understood as]{.mark} constituted
by social [performances of dominance]{.mark} rather than founded on some
given or objective notions of what science should be. **[Rather
than]{.mark} being [objective judgments]{.mark} of quality, [statements
like]{.mark} "this is good science" and "[these results are robust" are
signs without referents]{.mark} used to discipline**]{.underline}
(Baudrillard, 1995). The invisible disciplining nature of the
performative standards of knowledge cumulation is part of the story of
Butler's understanding of performativity. The other part is attention to
who is excluded by claims to knowledge cumulation (generally as well as
in specific paradigmatic situations), what is left out, and on what
axes. [These disciplinary standards]{.underline} (both in the
conventional and Foucauldian sense) [make invisible their own
impossibility and their related necessary failure.]{.underline}

**[For example, [a submission]{.mark}]{.underline}** to a traditional IR
journal in the United States or Western Europe **[which makes
an]{.underline}** interesting **[argument, but is [not in the format
of,]{.mark} methodologically acceptable to, inclusive of the same forms
of evidence [tradition]{.mark}ally used in]{.underline}**, and good
science to that journal's traditional reviewers **[[is unlikely to
succeed]{.underline}]{.mark}** in getting published.11 [This will
generally be [justified with reference to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[["quality"]{.underline}]{.mark} of the piece, [[and
rarely]{.underline}]{.mark} if ever [will questions of sex[, race,
gender, class]{.mark}]{.underline}, and other axes of exclusion [be
discussed as producers of the standards that then exclude on "quality"
[where "quality" has been set up in a way that **excludes all
performanc**]{.mark}**es of scholarship [which are not mimicry of
a]{.mark} particular [Western, liberal model]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Paolini, 1999).12 Even editors and **[[reviewers who note the
exclusion]{.mark}ary effect of these standards [will often mourn]{.mark}
that [and move on]{.mark},]{.underline}** imagining the only possible
alternative being lacking standards, and **[[seeing such a lack of
standards as more insidious than the exclusionary
effects]{.underline}]{.mark}** of using certain sets of standards[.
**["Knowledge]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[cumulation" [then becomes a set
of]{.mark} reified and [artificial standards rather than a journey for
truth]{.mark} or interest.]{.underline}**

[[The answer to this]{.mark} quagmire [is]{.mark} sometimes a liberal
politics of inclusion]{.underline} (e.g., Nedal & Nexon, 2018)---[[how
do "we" get more]{.underline}]{.mark} women, more
[[minorities]{.underline}]{.mark}, and more people from underrepresented
places in the world [[to]{.mark} be able to [meet the standards]{.mark}
of good scholarship in the field? **[That liberal]{.mark} politics of
[inclusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} while well-intended, **[[can
be read as]{.mark} a]{.underline}** (subtle, perhaps accidental)
**[expansion of]{.underline}** the **[[violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**
it (formally) seems to abate. **[[It fails to question]{.mark} the
utility of]{.underline}** the **[[existing
standards]{.underline}]{.mark}** of good scholarship **[[and
assumes]{.mark} that [those]{.mark} currently exc[luded would be happy
to change the form]{.mark}, shape, and/ or nature of their scholarship
[to fit within the]{.mark}]{.underline}** (unquestioned/unquestionable)
**[[mold]{.mark}]{.underline}** of good scholarship, either loosely or
strictly understood. As Puar (2006) argues, [liberal
"inclusion"]{.underline} to absorb the other within can be as violent as
if not more so than exclusion even as it appears progressive. That
[violence is the reproduction of naturalized, bounded identities when
identities are liminal and messy when not policed]{.underline} (e.g.,
Agathangelou, 2013; Haritaworn et al., 2013; Scott, 2013). The bounded
nature of IR inclusion excludes liminality, messiness, and outsideness
(e.g., Malksoo, 2012).

Expanding the boundaries of IR to include any given particular excluded
work maintains an illusion of stability, hiding what is unstable; it
maintains an illusion of certainty, hiding what is in doubt; it
maintains an illusion of coherence, hiding the rebellious, the failed,
and that which remains outside (e.g., Sjoberg, 2017). Queer theorizing
of the liminality involved in unstable sex/gender identities shows that
even that which is presumed to be the most primordial (sex identity) is
really liminality hiding under supposed definition (e.g., Weber, 2016a).
Translated to thinking about inhabitability, this theorizing suggests
that the apparent safety of (constituting then occupying) inhabitable
space hides liminality and uncertainty, and perhaps danger, under its
supposed (empirical and normative) clarity (Haritaworn et al., 2014).
Therefore, "all the repressive and reductive strategies of power systems
are already present in the internal logic of the sign," such "that
violence is an inevitable byproduct of signification" (Baudrillard,
1981).

In this way, [not only do [traditional standards]{.mark}]{.underline} of
knowledge [make invisible their own impossibility,]{.underline} **[they
[hide the violence of IR's denials of failure]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
continued insistence on traveling failed paths despite the condemnation
of failure and the privileging of success. **[[IR's continued]{.mark}
recursive [enactment of]{.mark} its settled ["standards" despite]{.mark}
their [obvious]{.mark} failure and [exclusiveness makes invisible the
raced, classed, and sexed impacts]{.mark} of those
standards]{.underline}** and their apparent objectivity. Baudrillard's
work provides a path for navigating this disjuncture between signs (IR's
"standards") and referents (the fantastic notion that "good scholarship"
exists objectively) (Baudrillard, 1975). He argues that "only
ambivalence, as a rupture of value... sustains a challenge to the
legibility, the false transparency of the sign... questions the evidence
of the use value of the sign (rational decoding) and of its exchange
value (the discourse of communication)." This ambivalence, Baudrillard
argues, "brings the political economy of the sign to a standstill; it
dissolves the respective definitions of symbol and referent"
(Baudrillard, 1981, p. 150).

Endorsing the inclusion of nontraditional perspectives, classifying and
categorizing them, and assuming inclusion's possibility may all have
violent impacts (for discussions of the violences of inclusion see
Haritaworn et al., 2013, 2014; Mbembe, 2019). Moving of the
signification "knowledge" from any referent to which it was originally
tied makes method and research performances of scholarship, rather than
(the illusive) scholarship itself. [If "research" is a performance of
scholarship, "standards" for research serve to disguise the fantastic
nature of knowledge cumulation. As such, there is no space for
liminality, uncertainty, change, inadequacy, and failure in structural
rather than passing senses.]{.underline} Yet looking beyond the
discourse of certainty, those pervade IR. A Baudrillardian ambivalence
toward research programs and their truth statements can reveal the
recursivity of IR's standards of knowledge cumulation. This is because
condemnation or rejection of any given research program and its truth
statements endorses its assumptions about truth, as well as some of its
assumptions about what the international arena is and how it works.

As such, the idea that [IR knowledge cumulation can be nothing but
fantasy]{.underline} is straightforward. [If the reification of
standards of knowledge cumulation is a signification divorced from a
referent,]{.underline} where the recovery of the referent is
conceptually and practically impossible, [then [knowledge cumulation
is]{.mark} and will always remain [an empty
signifier.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The only question is how that empty
signifier directs and is directed.]{.underline}

We suggest that, in IR, more often than not, knowledge cumulation
directs and is directed by discursive seduction. In Baudrillard's words,
seduction is "that which extracts meaning from discourse and detracts it
from its truth" (Baudrillard, 1991\[1979\], p. 54). [What makes a
discourse of knowledge]{.underline}, of science, [and of progress
seductive "is its very appearance: the aleatory, meaningless, or
ritualistic and meticulous circulation of signs on the surface, its
inflections and its nuances.]{.underline} All of this effaces the
content value of meaning, and this is seductive" (Baudrillard,
1991\[1979\], p. 54). Therefore, if there could be an interpretive
discourse of knowledge cumulation that reached truth value, that truth
value would be selfdefeating, since "the meaning of an interpretive
discourse, by contrast, has never seduced anyone." This is the
fundamental contradiction, in Baudrillard's terms, that makes standards
for knowledge cumulation in IR internally impossible. He explains that
"every interpretive discourse wants to get beyond appearances; this is
its illusion and fraud. But getting beyond appearances is appearance,
and is hence subject to the stakes imposed by seduction, and
consequently to its own failure as discourse" (Baudrillard,
1991\[1979\], p. 54). As such, what is left in/of the failed discourse
can only be the fantastic, and pretensions to success hollow.

Inhabiting a Failure of a Discipline

The need for success and the denial of failure depend on two things:
first, both success and failure existing and being identifiable; and
second, presuming a particular normative relationship between success
and failure. In IR, as we discussed above, scholars are thought of as
successes or failures according to a complicated metric of disciplinary
prestige based on publication outlet, "scientific standards," and
perception of the change that they have caused in the discipline. [[Work
is characterized as successful or failed based on]{.mark} whether it
contributes to [knowledge cumulation.]{.mark} The discipline itself is
understood as successful or failed based on the aggregation of those
measures. On these terms, [the emptiness of disciplinary
standards]{.mark} and the impossibility of knowledge cumulation [make
every piece of scholarship]{.mark} and every scholar [in IR a failure
and the discipline along with them]{.mark}.]{.underline}13 To us, the
identification of success/failure is impossible.

Still, we focus our approach to "disciplinary IR" around questioning the
second assumption, that the normative relationship between success and
failure is such that success is good and desirable and failure is bad.
Failure has been insufficiently explored in disciplinary IR, both in
thinking about the disciplinary enterprise and in thinking about the
world "out there" which we purport to study.14 Here, we look to theorize
the "upside" of the failure of the disciplinary enterprise of IR. It is,
after all, failure that Baudrillard called for, in different words---a
willingness to drop commitment to and passion for a certain end in the
recognition that both that end and its opposite are empty signifiers.
Queer theorists have suggested that this sort of failure---failure to
live up to expectations which were messy, detached, or a priori
untenable---might be worth celebrating (Halberstam, 2011). We build on
these two understandings to embrace failure in IR.

Often failure is thought about as either a final end (something has
failed), as a stumbling block on a path to success (if at first you do
not succeed, try, try again), or as a miscalibration (we thought this
was success, but really it is failure instead). With Jack Halberstam, we
suggest a normative reinterpretation. [Rather than seeing failure as an
end point]{.underline}, or as a stopping point on the way to success,
[it can be seen as itself a politics,]{.underline} "a category levied by
the winners against the losers" and "a set of standards that ensure all
future radical ventures will be measured as cost-ineffective"
(Halberstam, 2011, p. 184). Halberstam uses the example of reproductive
success. Inherited wisdom has suggested for a significant amount of time
that people should have children---that a heterosexual marriage with
biological offspring is the ideal of success in one's personal life.
That could be taken at face value: success (measured in biological
offspring to still-married heterosexual, cissexual parents) is to be
valued, and failure (measured in some other reproductive result) is to
be devalued. Or the very normative value attached to reproductive
success is itself a weapon, where associating failure with
non-reproduction is a category levied against the losers by the winners.
Redefining all reproductive results as successful or changing which
reproductive results are measured as successful does not change the
weaponized, normalizing character of the concept of success. This is a
metaphor for IR's disciplinary sociology, but it is also directly
applicable to IR's epistemological and methodological engagement with
non-heteronormativity

[Applied to IR, the normalization of "success" as the thing to which
all]{.underline} (researchers) [should aspire reifies membership in the
[categories of "successful" and "failed"]{.mark} and [provides]{.mark}
the "successful" with [a]{.mark} **powerful [weapon to]{.mark} continue
to [exclude,]{.mark} put down, [and delegitimize]{.mark} the
"unsuccessful." [The "winners" are]{.mark} by definition**]{.underline}
in a **[[normatively superior]{.underline}]{.mark}** position compared
to the "losers" despite the emptiness of the signification of each
category. [Understanding]{.underline} individual [pieces of
work]{.underline}, individual scholars, [or research paradigms as
failed]{.underline} (a foil to successful) [is a categorization
[wielded]{.mark} by those who have already been classified as successful
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} achieve and **[[perpetuate the exclusion of
those]{.mark} whom [they can constitute]{.mark} as
[inferior.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In this way, research **[success is a
category IR's winners wield against its losers to perpetuate their
position as winners]{.underline}**, consciously or unconsciously,
**[[against]{.mark} a background of]{.underline}** a
**[[disciplinary]{.underline}]{.mark}** IR where the
**[[standards]{.mark}]{.underline}** for research were
**[[created]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[largely [by white,
het]{.mark}erosexual [cis-men]{.mark}]{.underline}** and remain largely
undisturbed despite the intellectual and representational
diversification of IR research and IR scholars.

Failure as a category in IR scholarship serves to "reinscribe and
renormalize standards of 'research success' which remain unchanged,
unchangeable, and regressive" (Halberstam, 2011). The scholarship that
makes unconventional claims to knowledge cumulation (or no claim to
knowledge cumulation) not only fails but constitutes its researchers as
failures---which becomes recursive when "we tend to blame each other or
ourselves for the failures of the social structure we inhabit, rather
than critiquing the structures... themselves" (Halberstam, 2011, p. 35,
citing Kipnes, 2004). In Halberstam's view, **[it is the system that
privileges success, that is, the problem, and [failing within it]{.mark}
is an emancipatory possibility which ["dismantles the logics of success
and failure]{.mark} with which we currently live"]{.underline}**
(Halberstam, 2011, p. 2).

Realizing the caging nature of the boundaries of disciplinary success,
it is possible to think that **[failure might be perceived as something
to celebrate and strive toward rather than something which should
inspire shame.]{.underline}** Halberstam suggests that "under certain
circumstances, [failing]{.underline}, losing, forgetting, unmaking,
undoing, unbecoming, not knowing [may]{.underline} in fact [offer more
creative]{.underline}, more [cooperative, and]{.underline} more
[surprising ways of being in the world"]{.underline} (Halberstam, 2011,
pp. 2--3). In Halberstam's view, **[[it is only
when]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[norms]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
metrics by which we aspire to success **[[become]{.mark}]{.underline}**
both politicized and **[[problematized that freedom becomes
possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is not failing that we as scholars
or as people need to learn to do---we fail all the time. As Halberstam
notes, failure is endemic in life and work as "to live is to fail, to
bungle, to disappoint, and ultimately die," despite denial, resistance,
and constructs of success (Halberstam, 2011, pp. 186--187). Instead of
needing to learn to fail, we argue, [we need to]{.underline} learn to
[embrace]{.underline} failure, particularly the [collective failure
o]{.underline}f the enterprise of ["disciplinary IR"]{.underline} to
achieve or approximate "knowledge cumulation" generally or the
aspirations of particular research programs specifically.

### Framework -- Epistemology DA

#### The aff's representations function under "epistemologies of ignorance" that conceal racialized dispossession from mainstream public life

**Sabaratnam,** SOAS University of London, **20**

\[Meera, "Is IR Theory White? Racialized Subject-Positioning in Three
Canonical Texts", Millennium: Journal of International Studies", March
31^st^ 2020, Vol. 49, Sage Journals, accessed 6/24/22, GDS - LJ\]

Here, I synthesise strands from CRT and IR for a more systematic
conceptual account of [Whiteness as a form of subject-positioning that
are then used to support an empirical analysis of its manifestations
within IR theory]{.underline}. Conceptually, I **[posit that White
subjectpositioning is centrally characterised within discourse by
interlocking epistemologies of ignorance, immanence, and
innocence.]{.underline}** [These forms of subject-positioning are
racialised in that they assume a hierarchy of human
significance,]{.underline} [signal an identification with a set of
White-racialised historical subjects, and a subjective investment in
protecting or justifying extant White privilege and
supremacy]{.underline}. The concept of '[epistemologies of
ignorance']{.underline} as mentioned comes from the work of Mills, who
[has examined the ways in which liberal American political theory
foundationally rests on what he calls the racial
contract.44]{.underline} [The racial contract is a tacit agreement among
people racialised as White to discount the origins and functioning of
White supremacy from discussions about how society is and should be
organised.]{.underline} This is achieved through **[representations that
obscure, exclude or exceptionalise the central role of racialised
dispossession, violence, and discrimination in the making of the modern
world]{.underline}**.45 Importantly for Mills[, these forms of ignorance
are not accidental or random but deliberate and necessary for the
continued functioning of the present order as a White-dominated polity,
because calls for inter-racial justice can be comfortably and
systematically ignored in mainstream public life.]{.underline}46
'[Ignorance' is therefore central to the reproduction of White supremacy
in the United States. T]{.underline}his analytic resonates strongly with
Krishna's account of historical 'amnesia' in disciplinary IR and
Bhambra's observation about the ignoring of race in methodological
Whiteness.

### Framework -- Wargames DA

#### Their model weaponizes decision making skills to turn [debaters]{.underline} into [war planners]{.underline} 

**Hirst 20** -- Lecturer in International Relations Theory and Methods
at Kings College, PhD at University of Manchester \[Aggie, "States of
play: evaluating the renaissance in US military wargaming," Critical
Military Studies, 2020, DOI: 10.1080/23337486.2019.1707497, DKP\]

Wargaming's role as a source of doctrinal innovation, Work argued,
should be restored in the new security environment (Work 2015b, 2).
Specifically, as one article suggested, the DoD 'should pursue a joint
wargaming initiative designed to generate new concepts around the
proposed offset technologies. Wargames serve as a time-tested mechanism
for generating new ideas about warfare' (Norwood and Jensen 2016, 35).
In keeping with the 3OS's agenda of innovation, [the role of wargames
was to devise and experiment with novel applications for emergent
technologies and the US's broader operational approaches. In a security
environment characterized by]{.underline} widespread [ambiguity and
complexity, wargaming was to facilitate conceptual
innovation.]{.underline} In a coauthored article with Paul Selva, then
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Work laid out the key
applications of DoD wargaming:

> Wargames provide opportunities to test new ideas and explore the art
> of the possible. They help us imagine alternative ways of operating
> and envision new capabilities that might make a difference on future
> battlefields. When creatively and rigorously applied,
> **[[wargames]{.mark}]{.underline}** help us to think through and begin
> to resolve complex military challenges,
> **[[foster]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[testing of]{.mark}
> new]{.underline}** strategic and operational **[concepts, stimulate
> [debate]{.mark}, and inform investments]{.underline}** in new
> capabilities[. Wargames help strip down]{.underline} a strategic,
> operational, or tactical problem and reduce its
> [complexity]{.underline} in order [to identify the few, important
> factors that constrain us or an opponent.]{.underline} **[[They
> provide structured]{.mark}, measured[, rigorous]{.mark}]{.underline}**
> -- but intellectually liberating -- **[[environments
> to]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[help us [explore]{.mark} what works
> [(winning) and]{.mark} what doesn't [(losing)]{.mark}]{.underline}**
> across all dimensions of warfighting. [They permit hypotheses to
> be]{.underline} challenged and theories to be [tested]{.underline}
> during either adjudicated moves or free play settings, thereby
> [allowing]{.underline} current and [future leaders to
> expand]{.underline} the boundaries of [warfare theory.]{.underline}
> And they provide players with the opportunity to make critical
> mistakes and learn from them -- and to perhaps reveal breakthrough
> strategies and tactics when doing so (Work and Selva 2015).

With this restored faith in the innovative capacities of wargaming, its
resurgence began.

In his February memo, Work set out his vision for three time horizons
for the new DoDwide wargaming initiative. Led by the Combatant Commands
and Services, near-term [wargaming]{.underline} (0--5 years into the
future) [would focus on]{.underline} the execution and improvement of
current operations plans, using workshops, red-teaming, table-top
exercises, and [modelling and simulation for planning]{.underline},
experiments and proto-type development. Mid-term wargaming (5--15
years), led by the Joint Staff, would be dedicated to the development of
new capabilities and operational/organizational concepts by
incorporating innovative approaches and technologies into force
planning. Using workshops, seminar-style wargames, exercises and
modelling and simulation, [future scenarios would be gamed to explore
future US]{.underline} and [adversary]{.underline} orders of battle and
promote operational innovation. Long-term gaming (beyond 15 years) would
assess the operational impacts of technology, [explore future
challenges, and craft longterm competitive strategies.]{.underline} The
Office of Net Assessment was tasked with overseeing this future-focused
initiative (Work 2015b, 1--2).

\[...Continued\...\]

The central means by which wargaming intervenes in the human training
dimension is through the cultivation of particular kinds of
decision-making practices. Indeed, **[a [focus on decision-making is
the]{.mark} central [distinguishing feature]{.mark} of
wargaming]{.underline}**, setting it apart from other kinds of models
which do not have a 'human in the loop'. In Perla's words, ['a wargame
is an exercise in human interaction, and the interplay of human
decisions and the simulated outcomes of those decisions']{.underline}
(1990, 164). He expands elsewhere: **[wargames 'are about people making
decisions and [communicating them in the context of
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}** or conflict, usually with other
people -- all the [[**while plagued by uncertainty and
complexity.**]{.mark} Through these processes, the players live a shared
experience and learn from it']{.underline} (in Harrigan and Kirschenbaum
2016, 173). The Naval War College's \'War Gamers' Handbook\' similarly
defines wargaming as 'a tool for exploring decision-making possibilities
in an environment with incomplete and imperfect information' (Burns
n.d., 3)

According to its advocates, wargaming works by placing players in a
situation in which they are compelled to make decisions (Perla 1990,
203). [[By slotting participants into a scenario which calls for urgent
action]{.underline}]{.mark}, they argue, [[wargaming provides a
safe-to-fail space in which to gain decision-making
experience.]{.underline}]{.mark} As Perla recently noted, [games
work]{.underline} 'not by asking people to predict how they would react,
but [by forcing them]{.underline} actually [to react, even if that
action is within the context of the simulacrum of reality that is the
game. **A wargame is**]{.underline}, in effect, **[[a conflict
simulation run on the human brain]{.mark} rather than a
computer']{.underline}** (Pournelle and Deaton 2018, 77). The decisions
taken in game are thus a proxy for establishing what steps may need to
be taken in a real conflict. As the Army War College's 'Strategic
Wargaming Series Handbook' explains, 'players often discover the need to
make unanticipated decisions in order for the game to progress. The
rationale associated with decisions reached in the 'game-world' may
illuminate the need for 'realworld' decisions while also informing the
decision itself' (Markley ed. 2015, 2)

[The aim]{.underline}, then, [is]{.underline} to generate real
experience in a synthetic environment in order [[to become more
proficient at]{.mark} making decisions]{.underline} under pressure [and
[managing]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the
[[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} of those decisions. This involves an
'active and absorbing involvement in the challenge of [making 'life and
death' decisions']{.underline} (Perla 1990, 8), [providing a 'dress
rehearsal' for crises]{.underline} in which 'participants feel time and
events tightening on them'. This is useful from a training perspective
because in a game, 'as in a crisis, snap judgements -- even hunches --
drive decisions' (Allen 1989, 238). What wargaming accomplishes, then,
is the development of intuition on the basis of which decisions can be
made quickly and accurately. This is necessary because in the
foreseeable future,

> \[d\]ecision events will increase in frequency and speed. The
> "observe, orient, decide, and act" (OODA) loop decision cycle -- must
> be compressed in the short-term to "recognize, decide, act" (RDA).
> Observation and orientation as discrete actions will be a luxury that
> the future battlefield will not allow. Superiority will be predicated
> on further evolving the decision cycle to "predict, decide, and act"
> (PDA) -- with the goal of reducing (or ultimately eliminating) the
> time to decide -- or "predict and act" (PA) -- through automation, AI,
> and IA. (White et al. 2017, 23--4).

As this suggests, **[[the aim of wargaming is to develop specific
cognitive skills]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As such, it intervenes squarely
in the human dimension. As one report put it, '\[b\]eyond fielding a
force that simply competes in the physical domains, [[the Army of
2035]{.underline}]{.mark} and beyond [[must be designed to
dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} and achieve overmatch in [[the cognitive
domain]{.mark}; for the greatest potential for]{.underline} superiority
or [supremacy lies here']{.underline} (White et al. 2017, 25). [What is
necessary to make progress in this area]{.underline}, it is claimed, is
[to understand the conscious and unconscious elements of decision-making
processes rehearsed and developed through wargaming. **[The ultimate
goal of]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}these explorations of
**[[decision-making seems]{.mark} to be [to use individual players in
game as nodes which collectively shed light on organizational or
institutional decisionmaking]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [While it is not
possible to determine from the actions of a single player in a game what
the decisions]{.underline} taken in a real-world conflict [would
be]{.underline}, it is, [it seems, possible to aggregate decision-making
data collected in a game to gain a viable picture of real-world group
decision-making.]{.underline} As noted above, the aim is to 'use game
results to build models that deepen our understanding of patterns in
organizational decision-making' (Pournelle and Deaton 2018, 19).

The above section has established the wargaming CoP's claims surrounding
the utility of wargaming as a means to intervene in the human training
dimension through developing critical thinking, explorations of plural
futures, and mapping human decision-making. The following final section
argues these interventions amount to an important methodological and
epistemological challenge to conventional defence analysis insofar as
they echo salient critical/postpositivist critiques of positivist
approaches in the social sciences. It concludes that **[[by
repurposing]{.mark} these [critical tools]{.mark} to impact [upon
players, wargaming militarizes them.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Post-quantitative defence analysis

Wargaming's focus on critical thinking, plural futures, and reflexive
decision-making amounts to a significant departure from conventional,
quantitative OR analysis, signalling instead an inheritance from
critical/postpositivist traditions. In his analysis of the IDF's use of
such traditions, Weizman relays Director of the Operational Theory
Research Institute, Shimon Naveh's, account:

> We employ critical theory primarily in order to critique the military
> institution itself -- its fixed and heavy conceptual fundaments. . . .
> Theory is important for us in order to articulate the gap between the
> existing paradigm and where we want to go. . . . Without theory we
> could not make sense of different events that happen around us and
> that would otherwise seem disconnected (in Weizman 2006, 14).

Preferring Deleuze, Tschumi, Debord, and Bataille to Derrida, he
continues, in the IDF critical 'methods are projected in order to
conceive of forms of tactical attack in an 'enemy' city. **[[Education
in the humanities]{.mark}, often believed to be the best lasting weapon
with which to combat imperialism, [has been adopted as imperialism's own
weapon']{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}(Weizman 2006, 15). Building on
these insights, in this final section I argue that US military wargaming
similarly appropriates the means of critical/postpositivist approaches
in the service of the conventional ends of defence analysis. [By using
these methods to impact upon players]{.underline}, it concludes,
[wargaming contributes to the militarization of them.]{.underline} It
develops this account by exploring three key challenges posed by
wargaming to OR: the latter's claims to prediction, objectivity, and
rationalism.

###  Framework -- Institutions DA

Its [\[[White Being\]]{.mark} opened itself to
[inviting]{.mark}]{.underline} non-normative [[non-white people into
its]{.underline}]{.mark} power, into its
[[violence,]{.mark}]{.underline} even into its administrative forms of
[leadership,]{.underline} you know, Barack [Obama]{.underline}, Jackie
[Lacey,]{.underline} who until recently was the DA in Los Angeles and
helped protect the LAPD's violence against black people and brown people
and so forth, that's White Being. The major turn the book draws its
title from is this concept White Reconstruction, and I want to be really
clear, and I think folks will see this when they read the book, White
Reconstruction is not just talking about the post 1960s period, its not
naming one moment of revival of white supremacy and the ascendancy of
White Being, in the broad sense, the way I think about and define [White
Reconstruction, is as a]{.underline} kind of constantly
[resurging]{.underline} historically consistent [logic of reform and
institutional rearticulation that [attempts to sustain the ascendancy of
white]{.mark} self-making and [white world making]{.mark} within a
certain]{.underline} kind of [humanist futurity,]{.underline} white
humanist futurity, whether you call it modernity, whether you call it
civilization, manifest destiny, post racial etc. the book thinks through
are different periods and different geographies, different cultural
political projects, different racial narrative structures that
crystallize and enact that [[logic of reform]{.mark} and rearticulation
so the logic of white reconstruction [is to]{.mark} institute these
protocols of reform and change that [disavow racist, sexist,
misogynist]{.mark}]{.underline} you know [[transphobic colonial
anti-black]{.mark}]{.underline} other forms of [[oppressive power
while]{.underline}]{.mark} at the same [time
[reproducing]{.mark}]{.underline} and extending [[those]{.mark} power
[relations]{.mark} particular gendered anti-blackness and racial
colonial violence]{.underline} so both things happen within that
reformist logic it's a kind of move towards sustainability principally
of anti-blackness and racial colonial violence so I do focus somewhat on
the ongoing half century that has followed the so called civil rights
period you know what has followed the downfall of US apartheid but I
want to think about it as a historical logic, and the last term I will
talk about is this framework conversation this thing that I named
multiculturalist white supremacy. Or [[multicultural white
supremacy]{.mark}]{.underline} this [is just one of the technologies of
white reconstruction]{.underline} I want to get people to think deeply
and broadly about how the logics protocols [the institutions of
[normalized anti-black racial colonial violence]{.mark} become
promiscuously inclusive [under the auspicious of]{.mark} national
progress, [institutional progress]{.mark}, and sometimes even social
justice.]{.underline} I want to think about it as a technology, [I want
to think about multiculturalist white supremacy as creating]{.underline}
a sense or even [[an ethic of flexibility of
inclusivity]{.underline}]{.mark} of diversity of equity of solicitation
[that [incorporates]{.mark} a diversity of subjects meaning [black,
brown, indigenous]{.mark} people, [queer people, women]{.mark}
etc]{.underline} it invites these diverse subjects to inhabit the
systems and relations of power [[that end up reproducing]{.mark} the
ascendancy of [white being and perpetuate anti-blackness]{.mark} and
racial colonial power]{.underline}- so I see that as something that
people have been differently living in for at least the last 25-30
years, [I think it is inseparable from the emergence of]{.underline}
kind of official and [institutionalized state sanctioned forms of
multiculturalism]{.underline} but extends far beyond that and we are
absolutely in it right now [and [we have to be deeply]{.mark} skeptical
and [suspicious]{.mark} of it]{.underline} - so anyways those are four
key terms.

### AT -- Extinction First

#### The end of the world has already occurred -- its try-or-die for an alternative form of being-in-the-world 

**Death 22** -- Senior Lecturer in International Political Economy at
the University of Manchester \[Carl, "Africanfuturist Socio-Climatic
Imaginaries and Nnedi Okorafor's Wild Necropolitics," Antipode, Volume
54, Issue1 January 2022 Pages 240-258, DKP\]

Achille [Mbembe's]{.underline} (2019:7) [diagnosis of the present is
that ["\[n\]early everywhere the political order is]{.mark}
reconstituting itself as [a form of organisation for death". Even
liberal democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}, he argues[,
[are]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[characterised b]{.mark}y
"separation, [hate]{.mark} movements, [hostility,]{.mark}
and]{.underline}, above all, [struggle against an enemy"]{.underline}
(Mbembe 2019:42). [[War, racial hatred]{.mark}, the strengthening of
[borders]{.mark} and expulsion of enemies, the extreme
[inequality]{.mark} of contemporary capitalism, and the [accelerating
violence of]{.mark} runaway [climate]{.mark} change produce]{.underline}
what he terms [an era of necropolitics]{.underline}, which the Covid-19
crisis has merely exacerbated and heightened. [He uses the term
ne[cropolitics]{.mark} to [account for]{.mark} the various ways in which
[diverse weapons]{.mark} are [deployed in]{.mark} the interest of
[destroying life]{.mark}, and suggests that, **"[for a large share of
humanity, the end of the world has already
occurred"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Mbembe 2019:29). This trenchant
picture resonates strongly, as we will see below, with the world
Okorafor presents in the novel Who Fears Death. Like Okorafor, however,
Mbembe does not flinch from this portrayal of a world characterised by
violence and death, nor does he abandon all hope of a more convivial
politics. Rather, he asks: [What do human freedom and vulnerability mean
in a necropolitical context? [What alternative forms of
being-in-the-world are possible?]{.mark}]{.underline} Refusing the
binary choice between either violence or freedom, Mbembe (2019:92)
suggests that "today's form of necropower blurs the lines between
resistance and suicide, sacrifice and redemption, martyrdom and
freedom".

Frantz Fanon (2001, 2008) wrote in the 1950s of the need for a "new
humanism" that would set mankind free and restore human dignity, love,
and understanding. This concern with the politics and possibilities of a
new humanism is central to black feminist traditions of thought, which
have done most to explore these questions precisely because
[[the]{.mark} dominant genre of the [human]{.mark}---Man---[has always
been]{.mark} irreducibly [raced and gendered]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
Sylvia Wynter (2003:313) puts it:

> [This issue is that of the genre of the human]{.underline}, the issue
> whose target of abolition is the ongoing collective production of our
> present ethnoclass mode of being human, [Man: above all, its
> overrepresentation of its well-being as that of the human species as a
> whole, rather than as it is veridically: that of the Western and
> westernised (or conversely) global middle classes.]{.underline}

[This predominance of a particular conception of [human]{.mark}
existence, and its constitutive [role in]{.mark} carboniferous
[capitalism, racialised colonialism, patriarchy, and necropower, is why
it is necessary to "go about thinking]{.mark} and living [enfleshment
otherwise so as to usher in different genres of the
human"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Weheliye 2014:2; see also Jackson 2020;
Mbembe 2019:2). Inspired by Fanon's (2008:180) call to "introduce
invention into existence", Wynter asks: "How do we be, in Fanonian
terms, hybridly human?" (in Wynter and McKittrick 2015:45).

[For theorists like Mbembe, Wynter, Weheliye, Jackson, and others, [art
and the imagination have a crucial role to]{.mark} play.]{.underline} As
Wynter argues, [[humans are a storytelling species]{.mark}:]{.underline}
"the human is homo narrans", at least since African ancestors scratched
an intricate symbol on a piece of ochre in Blombos Cave (Wynter and
McKittrick 2015:25, 66). Zakiyyah Iman Jackson (2020:1) shows that
[imaginative work can frequently alter "the meaning and significance of
being (human)".]{.underline} Exploring the work of authors like Toni
Morrison, Nalo Hopkinson, Audre Lorde, Wangechi Mutu, and Octavia
Butler, Jackson (2020:4) explains how such texts can provoke "unruly yet
generative conceptions of being". [[Reading and
writing]{.underline}]{.mark} novels [[is itself a form of
theorising]{.mark} about the world, [and a way of practising new modes
of being]{.mark} and freedom]{.underline} (Ashcroft et al. 2002; Gergan
et al. 2020; Haraway 2016:12; Weheliye 2014:16).

journals (and textbooks) begs the question of what accounts for the
apparent disparity? Doty (1998, 145) argues that ['the dominant
understandings of]{.underline} theory and explanation in
[I]{.underline}nternational [R]{.underline}elations' [preclude
conceptualizations of]{.underline} 'complex issues/concepts such as
[race' and result in their marginalization]{.underline} or force them
'into constraining modes of conceptualization and explanation'. For
Krishna (2001, 401), the complexity is related less to the issue of
racism than to the [[method]{.mark}ological orientations]{.underline}
that often [privilege abstract theorizing over historical analyses,
**which [allows]{.mark} [IR]{.mark} theorists [to whitewash]{.mark} the
[historical content]{.mark} of global affairs, [especially]{.mark} 'the
[violence, genocide, and]{.mark} [theft]{.mark} that marked the
encounter between the rest and the West**]{.underline} in the
post-Columbian era'. **[Ignoring the role of racism [facilitates]{.mark}
this whitewash.]{.underline}** He adds that ['[abstraction]{.mark},
usually [presented as]{.mark} the desire of the discipline to engage in
[theory-building rather than]{.mark} in descriptive or [historical
analysis]{.mark}, is a screen that [simultaneously rationalizes and
elides]{.mark} the [details]{.mark} of these encounters. By encouraging
students to display their virtuosity in abstraction]{.underline} **[[the
discipline brackets]{.mark} questions of theft of [land, violence, and
slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}**---the three processes that have
historically underlain the unequal global order we now find ourselves
in' (Krishna 2001, 401-- 402). Further,
**[['overattention']{.underline}]{.mark}** on the part of scholars to
issues related **[[to racism]{.mark} in IR '[is disciplined]{.mark} by
professional practices that work [as taboo']{.mark}]{.underline}** and
may label such orientations as 'too historical or descriptive' **[[and
label]{.mark} such [students as]{.mark}]{.underline}** 'not adequately
theoretical' and **['[lacking in intellectual
rigor']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Krishna 2001, 402). Moreover, where the
impact of race and racism is analysed, insufficient attention is paid to
the relevance of struggles related to race and racism to basic
conceptions of fundamental issues in world politics such as power, war,
freedom or democracy. For example, Persaud (2001, 116) maintains that
'what needs to be underlined is that the struggle for racial equality
has been fundamental to the emergence of democracy as a whole, not just
for the colored world' (2001, 116).

Persaud and Walker (2001, 374) claim that
**[[race]{.mark}]{.underline}** has not been ignored **[in
IR]{.underline}** as much as it ['**[has been given the]{.mark}
epistemological [status of silence'.]{.mark}** This silence]{.underline}
is linked by Maclean (1981, 110) to 'invisibility', which ['refers to
the removal]{.underline} (not necessarily through conscious action)
[from a field of enquiry]{.underline}, either concrete aspects of social
relations, or of certain forms of thought about them'. Vitalis (2000)
also acknowledges a **['[norm against noticing' white racism]{.mark}
throughout mainstream IR discourse]{.underline}** (also see Depelchin
2005). Each of **[these processes [perpetuates]{.mark} the [racist
assumptions embedded in]{.mark} the [foundations]{.mark} of IR theory
[where they serve as]{.mark} the ['priors']{.mark} of the main
propositions.]{.underline}** These assumptions may be exposed by tracing
the racist claims that inform IR theory. This approach is different from
that undertaken in [most studies of racism in IR]{.underline}, which
usually [focus on one of four approaches]{.underline}: (1) [examinations
of]{.underline} the impact of [non-racial factors on racial outcomes,
such as]{.underline} the geographical studies of Linneaus and the
physical anthropological works of Blumenbach and Kant, which attempted
to determine the extent to which [environmental and climatic
factors]{.underline} led to the creation of different races;3 (2)
[examinations of the impact of racial outcomes on non-racial factors,
such as studies of]{.underline} the effects of racial stratification on
domestic outcomes (for example, [development or democracy]{.underline}),
or the impact of racial differences on the likelihood of violence within
or between states (for example, Deutsch 1970; Shepherd and LeMelle
1970); (3) [examinations of]{.underline} the impact of [racist practices
on the IR of states and non-state actors, such as]{.underline} studies
of diplomatic historians on racist practices such as international
slavery, imperial conquest, colonialism, [genocide,]{.underline}
apartheid, occupation, or racial discrimination, among single states,
several states, or international organizations (for example, Elkins
2004; Hochschild 1998; Tinker 1977; Vincent 1982; Winant 2001); and (4)
[examinations of]{.underline} the impact of [racist ideology on the IR
of states and nonstate actors, such as studies on the impact of racism
on foreign policy]{.underline} (for example, Hunt 1987; Lauren 1988;
Anderson 2003), imperialism (for example, Rodney 1974), state-making
(for example, Cell 1982; Fredrickson 1982; Mamdani 1996; Marx 1998),
diasporization (Harris 1982; Walters 1993) [or international
war]{.underline} (Dower 1986).

While [[studies]{.mark} utilizing each of these approaches]{.underline}
have contributed to our understanding of the role of racism in world
politics, they **[[have]{.mark} largely [ignored]{.mark}]{.underline}**
the issue of primary concern to us here: **[[how racism informs]{.mark}
the major paradigms of IR]{.underline}** theory **[such as [realism and
liberalism.]{.mark}]{.underline}**4 **[Racism informs IR]{.underline}**
theory mainly **[[through]{.mark} its influence on the [empirical,
ethical and epistemological assumptions that undergird its
paradigms.]{.mark}]{.underline}** These assumptions operate individually
and in combination. For example, [racist empirical assumptions bifurcate
humanity on the basis of race [and determine our view of
what]{.mark}/whom [we study and how]{.mark}]{.underline} we study
it/them---[[privileging the experiences of 'superior'
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark} and their societies and institutions.
[These assumptions]{.underline} also [lead us to privilege ethical
orientations of the 'superior']{.underline} peoples which justify their
privileged status. In such a context, [epistemological assumptions
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} reflect and [[reinforce the racist
dualism]{.mark} are more likely to become ascendant, and 'knowledge'
that supports the racist dichotomy]{.underline}---both the privileged
position of the racial hegemon and the underprivileged position of the
racial subaltern---[is more likely to be viewed as valid. Such knowledge
drawn from the empirical domain becomes legitimized through ethical
justifications]{.underline} that 'naturalize' the racial hierarchy. In
this way, the separate dimensions often reinforce each other.

Whether or not the empirical, ethical and epistemological assumptions
operate singly or in combination, it is important to demonstrate the
role of these assumptions in IR theory today, especially given that
mainstream IR also provides prominent critiques of racism. Ignoring
these critiques would misrepresent the degree of racism in the field and
disregard the challenge to racist discourse within IR from IR theorists
themselves. For example, few IR scholars openly embrace a racist
ontology that assumes for whites a higher order of being than for
nonwhites.5 Moreover, racist ethical assumptions usually receive the
opprobrium they deserve in present IR discourse. Racist epistemological
assumptions are largely challenged by the prevalence in IR theory of the
view that our 'knowledge' of world politics usually requires us to have
something approximating evidence to determine the accuracy of rival
truth claims. Finally, racist empirical assumptions are checked by the
dominant view in IR that our theses should be broadly applicable across
states and societies and should be substantiated by crossnational and
cross-temporal tests. But **[[the sanguine view]{.mark} [of the
propensity of IR]{.mark} literature [to check racist
assumptions]{.mark}, or to generate non-racist theoretical
discourse]{.underline}** for the field, **[[begs a fuller exploration of
how]{.mark} ethical, epistemological and empirical [assumptions underlie
prominent theses in IR.]{.mark} The main sources of [these racist
assumptions that inform]{.mark} our present [IR]{.mark} discourse [are
the primary theoretical constructs]{.mark} of most IR theory: [the state
of nature, the social contract and]{.mark} the conception of
[anarchy]{.mark} that derives from them.]{.underline}**

**Olson 15 -- prof of geography @ UNC Chapel Hill**

(Elizabeth, 'Geography and Ethics I: Waiting and Urgency,' *Progress in
Human Geography*, vol. 39 no. 4, pp. 517-526)

Though toileting might be thought of as a special case of bodily
urgency, geographic research suggests that [the body is increasingly set
at odds with large]{.underline}r [scale ethical concerns, especially
**large-scale future events of forecasted suffering**]{.underline}.
Emergency planning is a particularly good example in which the
[[large-scale threats]{.mark} of future suffering can **[distort moral
reasoning]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Žižek (2006) lightly develops this
point in the context of the war on terror, where in the presence of
fictitious and real ticking clocks and warning systems, [[the urgent
body must be **bypassed** because there are **bigger scales**
]{.mark}**to worry about**]{.underline}:¶ What does this all-pervasive
sense of urgency mean ethically? The pressure of events is so
overbearing, the stakes are so high, that they nec essitate a suspension
of ordinary ethical concerns. After all, displaying moral qualms when
the lives of millions are at stake plays into the hands of the enemy.
(Žižek, 2006)¶ In the presence of large-scale future emergency, [[the
urgency to secure]{.mark} the state, the citizenry, the economy, or the
climate [creates new scales and]{.mark} new [temporal orders]{.mark} of
response]{.underline} (see Anderson, 2010; Baldwin, 2012; Dalby, 2013;
Morrissey, 2012), many of which treat the urgent body as impulsive and
thus requiring management. McDonald's (2013) analysis of three
interconnected discourses of 'climate security' illustrates how bodily
urgency in climate change is also recast as a menacing impulse that
might require exclusion from moral reckoning. The logics of climate
security, especially those related to national security, 'can encourage
perverse political responses that not only fail to respond effectively
to climate change but may present victims of it as a threat' (McDonald,
2013: 49). [**[Bodies]{.mark} that are [currently suffering cannot be
urgent]{.mark}**[, because they are **excluded from the potential
collectivity** that could be **suffering everywhere in some future
time**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Similar [bypassing of existing
bodily urgency is echoed in writing about]{.underline} violent
securitization, such as drone warfare (Shaw and Akhter, 2012), and also
in [**intimate scales** like the street and the school, especially in
relation to race]{.underline} (Mitchell, 2009; Young et al., 2014).¶ [As
**large-scale urgent concerns are institutionalized**, the urgent body
is increasingly **obscured through technical planning and
coordination**]{.underline} (Anderson and Adey, 2012). [The predominant
characteristic of [this]{.mark} institutionalization]{.underline} of
large-scale emergency [[is a '**built-in bias for
action'**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Wuthnow, 2010: 212) **[that circumvents
contingencies]{.underline}**. [The urgent body is at best an assumed
eventuality, one that will]{.underline} likely [require]{.underline}
another state of waiting, such as **[triage]{.underline}** (e.g.
Greatbach et al., 2005). Amin (2013) cautions that in much of the West,
governmental need to provide evidence of laissez-faire governing on the
one hand, and assurance of strength in facing a threatening future on
the other, produces 'just-in-case preparedness' (Amin, 2013: 151) of
neoliberal risk management policies. In the US, 'personal ingenuity' is
built into emergency response at the expense of the poor and vulnerable
for whom '\[t\]he difference between abjection and bearable survival'
(Amin, 2013: 153) will not be determined by emergency planning, but in
the material infrastructure of the city.¶ In short, [the urgencies of
the body provide justifications for social exclusion of the most
marginalized based on]{.underline} impulse and [perceived
threat]{.underline}, while **[[large-scale future emergencies]{.mark}
effectively [absorb the deliberative power of urgency into]{.mark} the
[institutions]{.mark} of preparedness and risk avoidance]{.underline}**.
[Žižek references Arendt's]{.underline} (2006) [analysis of the banality
of evil to explain]{.underline} the [current]{.underline} state of
[ethical reasoning]{.underline} under the war on terror, noting that
people who perform morally reprehensible actions under the conditions of
urgency assume a 'tragic-ethic grandeur' (Žižek, 2006) by sacrificing
their own morality for the good of the state. But his analysis fails to
note that bodies are today so rarely legitimate sites for claiming
urgency. [[In the]{.underline}]{.mark} context of the [**[assumed
priority of the large-scale]{.mark} future emergency**, [the urgent body
becomes]{.mark} **literally nonsense[, a non sequitur]{.mark}** within
societies, states and worlds that will **always be more
urgent**]{.underline}.¶ If the important ethical work of urgency has
been to identify that which must not wait, then the capture of the power
and persuasiveness of urgency by large-scale future emergencies has
consequences for the kinds of normative arguments we can raise on behalf
of urgent bodies. How, then, might waiting compare as a normative
description and critique in our own urgent time? Waiting can be
categorized according to its purpose or outcome (see Corbridge, 2004;
Gray, 2011), but it also modifies the place of the individual in society
and her importance. As Ramdas (2012: 834) writes, '[waiting ... produces
hierarchies which segregate people and places into those which matter
and those which do not']{.underline}. The segregation of waiting might
produce effects that counteract suffering, however, and Jeffery (2008:
957) explains that though the 'politics of waiting' can be repressive,
it can also engender creative political engagement. In his research with
educated unemployed Jat youth who spend days and years waiting for
desired employment, Jeffery finds that 'the temporal suffering and sense
of ambivalence experienced by young men can generate cultural and
political experiments that, in turn, have marked social and spatial
effects' (Jeffery, 2010: 186). Though this is not the same as claiming
normative neutrality for waiting, it does suggest that waiting is more
ethically ambivalent and open than urgency.¶ In other contexts, however,
our descriptions of waiting indicate a strong condemnation of its
effects upon the subjects of study. [[Waiting can]{.mark} demobilize
radical reform, **[depoliticizing 'the insurrectionary possibilities of
the present by delaying]{.mark} the revolutionary imperative [to a
future moment]{.mark} that is forever drifting towards
infinity'**]{.underline} (Springer, 2014: 407). Yonucu's (2011) analysis
of the self-destructive activities of disrespected working-class youth
in Istanbul suggests that this sense of infinite waiting can lead not
only to depoliticization, but also to a disbelief in the possibility of
a future self of any value. [[Waiting,]{.mark} like urgency, [can
**undermine**]{.mark} **the possibility of
[self-care]{.mark}**]{.underline} two-fold, first by making people wait
for essential needs, and again by reinforcing that waiting is
'\[s\]omething to be ashamed of because it may be noted or taken as
evidence of indolence or low status, seen as a symptom of rejection or a
signal to exclude' (Bauman, 2004: 109). This is why Auyero (2012)
suggests that waiting creates an ideal state subject, providing
'temporal processes in and through which political subordination is
produced' (Auyero, 2012: loc. 90; see also Secor, 2007). Furthermore,
Auyero notes, it is not only political subordination, but the subjective
effect of waiting that secures domination, as citizens and non-citizens
find themselves 'waiting hopefully and then frustratedly for others to
make decisions, and in effect surrendering to the authority of others'
(Auyero, 2012: loc. 123).¶ [[Waiting can]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
[[function as a]{.mark} potentially important spatial [technology of the
elite]{.mark} and powerful, mobilized not only for the purpose of
**governing individuals**, but also [to **retain claims over moral
urgency**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [But there is **growing
resistance** to the capture of claims of urgency by the
elite]{.underline}, and it is important to note that even in cases where
the material conditions of containment are currently impenetrable,
[arguments based on human value are at the forefront of **reclaiming
urgency for the body**. In **detention centers, clandestine prisons,
state borders and refugee camps**, geographers point to]{.underline}
ongoing struggles against [the ethical impossibility of bodily
urgency]{.underline} and a rejection of states of waiting (see Conlon,
2011; Darling, 2009, 2011; Garmany, 2012; Mountz et al., 2013; Schuster,
2011). Ramakrishnan's (2014) analysis of a Delhi resettlement colony and
Shewly's (2013) discussion of the enclave between India and Bangladesh
describe people who refuse to give up their own status as legitimately
urgent, even in the context of larger scale politics. Similarly, Tyler's
(2013) account of desperate female detainees stripping off their clothes
to expose their humanness and suffering in the Yarl's Wood Immigration
Removal Centre in the UK suggests that demands for recognition are not
just about politics, but also about the acknowledgement of humanness and
the irrevocable possibility of being that which cannot wait. The
continued existence of places like Yarl's Wood and similar institutions
in the USA nonetheless points to [the challenge of exposing the urgent
body as a moral priority when it is so easily hidden from
view]{.underline}, and also reminds us that our research can help to
explain the relationships between normative dimensions and the political
and social conditions of struggle.¶ In closing, geographic depictions of
waiting do seem to evocatively describe otherwise obscured suffering
(e.g. Bennett, 2011), but it is striking how rarely these descriptions
also use the language of urgency. Given the discussion above, what might
be accomplished -- and risked -- by incorporating urgency more overtly
and deliberately into our discussions of waiting, surplus and abandoned
bodies? Urgency can clarify the implicit but understated ethical
consequences and normativity associated with waiting, and encourage
explicit discussion about harmful suffering. Waiting can be productive
or unproductive for radical praxis, but urgency compels and requires
response. Geographers could be instrumental in reclaiming the ethical
work of urgency in ways that leave it open for critique, clarifying
common spatial misunderstandings and representations. There is good
reason to be thoughtful in this process, since moral outrage towards
inhumanity can itself obscure differentiated experiences of being human,
dividing up 'those for whom we feel urgent unreasoned concern and those
whose lives and deaths simply do not touch us, or do not appear as lives
at all' (Butler, 2009: 50). But [when the urgent body is rendered as
only waiting]{.underline}, both materially and discursively, [it is just
as easily cast as impulsive, disgusting, animalistic]{.underline} (see
also McKittrick, 2006). [Feminist theory insists that [the urgent
body]{.mark}, whose [encounters]{.mark} of violence [are]{.mark}
'usually [framed as]{.mark} **private, [apolitical and
mundane']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Pain, 2014: 8), [[are as deeply
**political, public, and exceptional**]{.mark} as other forms of
violence]{.underline} (Phillips, 2008; Pratt, 2005). [[Insisting that
**a suffering body, now, is that which cannot wait**, has the **ethical
effect of drawing it into consideration alongside the**]{.mark}
**political, public and exceptional [scope of large-scale
futures]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [It may help us insist on the
body]{.underline}, both as a single unit and a plurality, [as a
legitimate scale of normative priority and social care]{.underline}.¶ In
this report, I have explored old and new reflections on the ethical work
of urgency and waiting. Geographic [[research suggests]{.mark} a
contemporary popular [bias towards the urgency of large-scale
futures,]{.mark} institutionalized [in ways that]{.mark}]{.underline}
further **[[obscure and discredit the urgencies of the
body]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This bias]{.underline} also [justifies the
production of new **waiting places**]{.underline} in our material
landscape, **[places like the detention center]{.underline}** and the
waiting room. In some cases, waiting is normatively neutral, even
providing opportunities for alternative politics. In others, the
technologies of waiting serve to manage potentially problematic bodies,
leading to suspended suffering and even to extermination (e.g. Wright,
2013). One of my aims has been to suggest that [**[moral
reasoning]{.mark} is important** both because it **[exposes]{.mark}
normative [biases against subjugated people]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} because it potentially **[[provides routes
toward struggle]{.mark} where claims to urgency seem to
foreclose]{.underline}** the **[possibilities]{.underline}** of
alleviation of suffering. **[[Saving the world]{.mark} still [should
require a debate about whose world is being saved]{.mark}, when, and at
what cost -- and this requires a debate about what really cannot
wait]{.underline}**. My next report will extend some of these concerns
by reviewing how feelings of urgency, as well as hope, fear, and other
emotions, have played a role in geography and ethical reasoning.¶ I
conclude, however, by pulling together past and present. In 1972,
Gilbert White asked why geographers were not engaging 'the truly urgent
questions' (1972: 101) such as racial repression, decaying cities,
economic inequality, and global environmental destruction. His question
highlights just how much the discipline has changed, but it is also
unnerving in its echoes of our contemporary problems. Since White's
writing, our moral reasoning has been stretched to consider the future
body and the more-than-human, alongside the presently urgent body --
topics and concerns that I have not taken up in this review but which
will provide their own new possibilities for urgent concerns. My own
hope presently is drawn from an acknowledgement that [the **temporal
characteristics of contemporary capitalism** can be interrupted in
creative ways]{.underline} (Sharma, 2014), [with the possibility of
squaring the urgent body with our large-scale future
concerns]{.underline}. [**[Temporal alternatives already exist in
ongoing and emerging revolutions]{.mark}** and the disruption
of]{.underline} claims of cycles and [circular political
processes]{.underline} (e.g. Lombard, 2013; Reyes, 2012). [Though
**[calls for urgency will certainly be used to obscure evasion of
responsibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Gilmore, 2008: 56, fn 6),
[[they may]{.mark} **also [serve as fertile ground for radical
critique]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} a truly fierce **urgency for
now.**]{.underline}

An Afrocentric Paradigm of World Politics

[Kimira]{.underline} provides such a framework by drawing, inter alia,
on the pan-Africanist theses outlined above and [suggest]{.underline}ing
[that the [interaction of culture groups]{.mark}]{.underline} (whether
[within states or between]{.underline} them) [[plays an important role
in i]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational [[r]{.underline}]{.mark}elations.
Afrocentric culturalists claim that culture groups pursue
self-determination and the alleviation of physical, symbolic, and
psychic scarcities within and across the politico-economic units in
which they are situated. [[Contrary to realist]{.mark} views that
emphasize political--military factors, [idealist views]{.mark} that
focus on political--economic factors, or Marxist views]{.underline} that
emphasize socio-economic class, culturalists argue that [[the drive to
perpetuate the culture group serves as]{.mark} the basis for the
provision of the political and economic [superstructure]{.mark} of the
society.]{.underline} This is one reason why [culture groups persist
even as their societies might be transformed]{.underline} economically
[(e.g. [through slave-holding]{.mark}]{.underline}, feudal, capitalist,
and/or socialist systems) [[or]{.mark} politically]{.underline} (e.g.
through monarchical, republican, corporatist, and/or liberal democratic
systems). [[Diasporazation]{.mark} brings other culture
groups]{.underline} into the fold, [modifying the]{.underline} original
cultural [composition]{.underline} of the society and creating, [over
time]{.underline}, political, economic, and cultural challenges to the
status quo. [Eventually, political, economic, and cultural boundaries
become incongruent]{.underline} as societies become increasingly
heterogeneous.

Witnessing this process over time, one observes that **[[most
states]{.underline}]{.mark}**, today[, **[are]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[multicultural [amalgamations]{.mark}]{.underline}** of diverse
culture groups **[[rather than]{.mark} actual
"[nation-states."]{.mark}]{.underline}** Culture groups in these
predominantly heterogeneous societies employ strategies of cooperation
and conflict in pursuit of self-determination and the alleviation of
perceived and real scarcities in their social and physical environments.
[The process through which]{.underline} diverse cultural [groups are
brought into the domestic body politic can have repercussions for
international conflict and cooperation.]{.underline} That is, **[the
process of [nation-building]{.mark}]{.underline}** and national
mobilization **[may [unleash]{.mark} forces of
[ethnonationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}** or religious intolerance
**[that might increase tensions]{.underline}** within and between
political units. **[Competition among cultural groups]{.underline}**
within such political units as territorial states **[has implications
for i]{.underline}**nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations, **[as
[decision-makers must play to domestic audiences with regard to]{.mark}
their [foreign policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example, one might
conjecture that [a state's treatment of a cultural group]{.underline}
within its domestic sphere [should be associated with its treatment of
that group's cultural cousins abroad.]{.underline} Therefore, one may
contend that states that are culturally similar may be less likely to
fight each other and may be more likely to cooperate with each other due
to the presence of convergent interests borne of cultural affinity. In
addition, one might suggest that [the cultural composition of a state
itself]{.underline} (e.g. its degree of cultural homo- geneity) [may be
associated with its prospects for international conflict and
cooperation]{.underline}. Each of these theses is consistent with
kimira's focus on the role of culture in world politics.

Importantly, **[kimira binds its focus on culture within an overall
theoretical framework that draws on African historical
modalities.]{.underline}** While space does not allow for the full
articulation of the culturalist processes associated with a state's
foreign policy behavior, nevertheless, **[[kimira suggests]{.mark} (1[)
a different unit of analysis]{.mark} for the study of world
politics---[culture]{.mark} groups, (2) a [different mechanism for
change]{.mark} in the global system---[diasporazation, and]{.mark} (3)
[justifications for]{.mark} the unit's [pursuit of change---cultural
self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the alleviation of
perceived scarcity.

At its core, **[the [Afrocentric]{.mark}]{.underline}** culturalist
**[[argument suggests a significant relationship
between]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[cultural
characteristics]{.mark}]{.underline}** of states
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** their likelihood of **[interstate
[conflict]{.mark},]{.underline}** which is **[[in contrast
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** the major Eurocentric paradigms of world
politics, **[[realism and idealism]{.mark}, which]{.underline}** largely
**[deny such a relationship.]{.underline}**19 Instead, [for realists,
interstate conflict is dominated by realpolitik factors]{.underline}
such as power, [while for idealists, factors such as the type of
government]{.underline} in a state [are assumed to be more
salient]{.underline} predictors of international conflict.20 On the
other hand, culturalists focus on the cultural composition of a state as
a predictor to its foreign policy behavior as a result of the impact of
culture groups on their government. Arguably, these processes are
accentuated within culturally homo- geneous states where a single
culture group dominates the society because in those cases we'd expect
the full leverage of the state to be exerted on the conflict
exacerbating aspects of a state's foreign policy (e.g.
hyper-nationalism). If individual homogeneous states are prone to
conflict then it is plausible that where such states square off against
rivals that are likewise homogeneous that the likelihood of interstate
conflict is heightened. Previous studies have not focused on the impact
of cultural homogeneity on the likelihood of interstate war for pairs of
states; therefore, I examine this basic culturalist contention in this
study. [Since cultural homogeneity itself is primarily a result of

In the social sciences, [worldviews generate
[paradigms]{.mark},]{.underline} which are theoretical frameworks [to
guide and [inform research]{.mark}]{.underline} in a field of study.
[Just as [realism and idealism are Eurocentric]{.mark}
paradigms]{.underline} of world politics,
**[[kimira]{.underline}]{.mark}**---or culturalism---**[is an
Afrocentric paradigm of world politics]{.underline}**, which is
**[informed by pan-Africanist perspectives of
i]{.underline}**nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations.4 Its basic
thesis is that [cultural factors are important correlates]{.underline}
of international interactions. [This "culturalist" paradigm]{.underline}
also [[synthesizes]{.mark} several [pan-Africanist
analyses]{.mark}]{.underline} of the processes operative in
African--American politics, [including Karenga's "kawaida theory" and
Obadele's "macro-level model,"]{.underline} and generalizes from their
African-- American modalities to the behavior of states throughout the
globe.5 It is useful to briefly review these two theses before
discussing the kimira paradigm itself.

The Theoretical Roots of the Afrocentric Paradigm

[Karenga's framework, [**kawaida,** attempts to
explicate]{.mark}]{.underline} African--American [[relations]{.mark} in
the US [through]{.mark} an examination of]{.underline} the role of
culture in **[[black politics.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It posits that
**[cultural grounding and [focus]{.mark} are ineluctable elements [of
black liberation]{.mark} and social development]{.underline}**, and that
national culture is "the self-con- scious, collective thought and
practice thru \[sic\] which a people creates itself, celebrates itself
and introduces itself to history and humanity." 6 Karenga maintains that
**[the [imposition of]{.mark} the values and customs of the dominant
[Euro]{.mark}pean-- [American culture]{.mark}---especially its white
supremacist aspects---serves to legitimize the oppression of
African--Americans.]{.underline}** Further, he insists that
**[European--American cultural imposition denigrates the]{.underline}**
national (pan-African) **[culture of African-- Americans
and]{.underline}** results in its replacement with a faddish popular
culture that **[[does not serve black interests.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Altering Cruse's thesis of cultural revolution,7 which for him was
rooted in the use of popular culture as a change agent, Karenga
emphasizes the role of national culture in black liberation.8
Ostensibly, since Afrocentric cultural grounding is at odds with
Eurocentric culture, what results is a conflict at the cultural borders
of the society which, when heightened, engenders revolution and a basic
reorientation of the society. Karenga augurs the development of **[[a
black]{.mark} intellectual [vanguard]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** commit class suicide and subsequently
**["[create an Afro-centric]{.mark} ideology or social [theory which
negates the ruling race]{.mark}/class ideology and provides the basis
for a critical Afro-centric conception of reality and the possibilities
and methods of changing it."]{.underline}**9 Armed with this Afrocentric
focus, **[the vanguard would then lead a cultural revolution among
African--Americans, [which would]{.mark}]{.underline}** precede, and
[**[make possible, broader political revolution.]{.mark}** Within this
cultural revolution]{.underline}, he suggests[, there is a]{.underline}
reafrmation, revitalization[**,** [and reclamation of]{.mark} the
national [culture of black Americans denied by]{.mark} the dominant
**[white supremacist culture.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### AT: Perm -- Racializing Privilege 

#### Racialized Privilege Link: The aff's assertion of innocence creates racialized discourses of innocence that enforces systematically repressed backlash against social transformation while justifying embedded racism

**Sabaratnam,** SOAS University of London, **20**

\[Meera, "Is IR Theory White? Racialized Subject-Positioning in Three
Canonical Texts", Millennium: Journal of International Studies", March
31^st^ 2020, Vol. 49, Sage Journals, accessed 6/24/22, GDS - LJ\]

To the epistemologies of 'ignorance' and 'immanence', however, we need
to add an analytic of 'innocence' as characteristic of Whiteness. This
is partially subsumed under 'ignorance' in the work of Krishna but
deserves attention in its own right. [Wekker's work draws attention to
the projection of 'White innocence']{.underline} within the Netherlands
[around racism.51 Epistemologies of innocence seek to emphasise the
inadvertent, unintentional, and exceptional character of racist
behaviours or practices.]{.underline} [These claims to innocence often
emerge directly in response to accusations or discussions of
racism.5]{.underline}2 For Wekker[, the trope of innocence is central to
White subject-positioning through the profession of good faith and moral
respectability. This is because it functions to separate Whiteracialised
populations from both histories of colonial and imperial domination and
contemporary practices of racialised discrimination.53 Innocence
discourse instead locates racism as a matter of exceptional behaviour
rooted in personal and conscious forms of discrimination which have
mostly been overcome. **This means engagement with racism as a
structural phenomenon is systematically repressed,**]{.underline}
[accompanied by forms of denial, hurt, outrage, and backlash where this
is questioned, often evidencing a subjective investment in Whiteness
itself.]{.underline}

To go back to the understanding of race as a specific historical
transnational social formation or social system,54 [we can see that
epistemologies of innocence preserve a particular collective mapping of
political belonging, responsibility, and justice;]{.underline} one which
consistently separates racially privileged peoples from the historical
and contemporary production of their privilege or consequences of their
actions. [There is a contradiction, however, because this deflection of
blame for past evils is not complemented by a refusal to take ownership
of appropriated land, wealth or property -- that is, the material bases
of racialised privilege, or of cultural credit for political ideas or
historical developments]{.underline}. Discourses of White innocence and
good faith instead make possible and manage these contradictions of
racialised political governance in society.

Relations and Africana Studies at Brown, \*\* PhD Student in Human
Geography, UC Berkeley \[Camilla, Kaily, "A seat at the table?
Reflections on Black geographies and the limits of dialogue," 2018,

[[It is impossible to engage with]{.mark} the [politics]{.mark} of
dialogue [without]{.mark} first situating]{.underline} ourselves---after
all, these are fundamentally [[questions of power and
access]{.mark}.]{.underline} I (Camilla) am a first-generation
university student and the first in my immediate family to pursue a
graduate degree. [As a Black woman]{.underline} geographer, [I must
continuously reckon with the fact that the university---and the
discipline of geography itself---was not made for me. Historically, [the
university has been a site wherein]{.mark} the [subjugation]{.mark} of
women and people of color [has been]{.mark} articulated and
[legitimated]{.mark}.]{.underline} Still, I was drawn to human geography
because it appeared to be a capacious, interdisciplinary field with
productively porous boundaries. In other words, geography seemed to
welcome, rather than strictly regulate, theoretical and methodological
dialogue between disciplines. But when I began my PhD program, I
experienced a distinct sense of alienation as I attempted to do research
that seemed marginal to geography (specifically, understanding how Black
youth in Italy craft a sense of place that challenges the symbolic and
material boundaries of Europeanness and Italianness). I was alarmed that
the vocabulary and rich canon shaped by my background in Africana
studies (for instance, theories of diaspora, or the works of scholars
such as Paul Gilroy and Sylvia Wynter) were not always recognized as
'formally' geographical, even though the issues they addressed were
fundamentally about space, place, and power. [I was]{.underline}
similarly [alarmed by the fact that, in a discipline whose history is so
closely tied to the violent histories of colonialism and racism, race
remained a relatively insignificant category]{.underline} in
contemporary geography, [a 'superstructural' embellishment]{.underline}
atop the 'material', clanking gears of capitalism. The questions that
animated my research and the intellectual genealogies I wanted to draw
upon, were deeply spatial but seemedillegible to geography. They were,
in other words, beyond dialogue.

As a Black woman, I (Kaily) can recall being taught from a very early
age not to fight back. When I mouthed off, I was told to sit down and
quite literally to shut up. 'Black' and 'girl' were thrown in my face as
insults, justifications for my silence. Insecure in my body, I was also
insecure in place, as I constantly moved around the country. Feeling
powerless to do much to tangibly or markedly interface with the city
streets or Midwestern fields in which I grew up, I found myself drawn to
art and photography as some of the few ways I could dialogically assert
the power of my body and represent it assuredly in place. Having
utilized this embodied knowledge in my thesis research, my advisor
proposed that I look into geography programs for my PhD. I found it to
be a thrilling and expansive field that had the capacity to engage the
language of visual representation and its materialization in structures
of race, class, and environment. Like Camilla, my enthusiasm quickly
hardened into exasperation when I found that theories of race and gender
in geography were limited to one week each in most first-year curricula.
I was, and still am, seeking to find the middle ground between the
extensive attention Black studies scholars have paid to representations
of race, and geographical scholarship on how place is epistemologically
formed. It is time that geographers utilized the interdisciplinary
nature of their field to widen dialogue formerly limited by structural
inequalities.

As Rose-Redwood et al. (2018) rightly argue, certain voices have been
systematically excluded from the physical and metaphorical spaces of
dialogue within the field of human geography. The marginalization of
Black geographic scholarship within the discipline cannot be understood
separately from the marginalization of Black scholars at all levels
within geography. This means that **[the [academy can itself be a site
of violence]{.mark} that regulates who can participate in scholarly
dialogue. [But,]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the same time, we want to
argue that [**the project of [Black Geographies is more than simply a
project of 'add Black people and stir'.]{.mark}** It is about moving
beyond a liberal politics of superficial]{.underline} and provisional
[inclusion]{.underline} to think seriously about which voices,
intellectual genealogies, and traditions of thought are deemed
sufficiently canonical or scholarly---and why.

[[Claims to dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark} within human geography, and
the academy writ large, [[are]{.mark}]{.underline} frequently [[invoked
to obscure a lack of engagement]{.mark} with noncanonical
scholarship.]{.underline} Yet we are still convinced that geography has
important things to offer our understanding of blackness, and vice
versa---that **[[centering blackness can]{.mark} actually [tell us
important things about]{.mark} [space]{.mark} and [place]{.mark}, about
[power and]{.mark} the politics of [resistance.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[The Black Geographies Symposium]{.underline}, for instance, [was
centered on a shared understanding of blackness as a fundamentally
spatial relation, of space as profoundly racialized, and of the history
of geography as entangled with racism, colonialism, and
enslavement.]{.underline} What would it mean, for instance, if
geographers were to read Marx on the factory alongside W.E.B. Du Bois
and C.L.R. James on the plantation, or Jamaica Kincaid alongside Doreen
Massey on relational understandings of place? A Black geographical
scholarly praxis entails a willingness to subvert arborescent models of
intellectual lineage in favor of queerings, rhizomes, undercommons
(Harney and Moten, 2013), provincializations, or even the Sankofa
(Benjamin, 2013). These are, in other words, nonhierarchical and
nonlinear modes of study that can attend to the complex geographical
itineraries and interconnected struggles that continue to shape our
understandings of the relations of capitalism, racism, and sexism that
structure the modern world.

Perhaps, then, we should be striving for something more radical than
dialogue. Rose-Redwood et al. (2018) point toward the possibilities of
dialogue as embodied action; but [[what if we instead take liberatory
knowledges as the **point of departure, rather than 'democratic'
dialogue**]{.mark}]{.underline} or abject embodiment? In her keynote
presentation at the Black Geographies symposium, Katherine McKittrick
suggested that [scholarly dialogue necessarily invokes the materiality
of humanness in both body and place:]{.underline}

> ['The materiality of intellectual inquiry]{.underline}, the ideas we
> share, the counsel we give each other, [is an ongoing referential
> conversation about Black humanity. \[ \...\] [The materiality of
> intellectual inquiry]{.mark}, the ideas we share, is a referential
> conversation that [begins from Black humanness'.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Link -- Cyber Security 

#### Cyber warfare is a product of racial capitalisms unconscious -- the root cause is violence shaped by inter-capitalist rivalries that make war inevitable and maintains the states monopoly on violence 

**Dyer-Witherford and Mtviyenko 17** -- Nick Dyer-Witheford is an
Associate Professor in the Faculty of Information and Media Studies at
University of Western Ontario and Svitlana Matviyenko is an Assistant
Professor of Critical Media Analysis in the School of Communication
\[Nick, Svitlana, "Cyber-War and Contemporary Marxism," 2017, DKP\]

**[Cyber-war could]{.underline}**, in theory **[be part of a
contemporary revolutionary war position which might
include]{.underline}** development **[militant hacking to
sabotage]{.underline}** and paralyse **[corporate operations, recovering
the worker power lost by the (cybernetic) diminishment of the power of
the mass strike]{.underline}**, etc, or disrupting the financial sector.
More loosely, as [we have already mentioned the last decades of seen
some successes in cyber-organizing of occupations, demonstrations and
riots, and one could imagine this process intensifying in future
crises.]{.underline} However, there are problems in particular to
applying cyber-war to revolutionary ends. As Hassan (2013),
Dyer-Witheford (2015) and others have argued, there is a misfit between
the speed and secrecy of cyber-war practices and the slower and social
logic that, in the long term, form radically emancipatory subjects and
movements: reliance on cyber-organizing probably account for some of the
\"up like a rocket, down like a stick\" aspect of the 2011 occupations.
Moreover, despite hacker romanticism, there is a persisting imbalance of
power between state and no-state forces even in the digital realm
(Healey 2013), and the new vulnerability of social movements to
surveillance cyber-crackdowns seriously jeopardises all sorts of
cyber-organizing hacktivism. To assess the future possibilities of
revolutionary cyber-war therefore requires an overall assessment of the
diverse factors at play in the emergence of cyber-war as a feature of
contemporary capitalism, a task to which we now turn.

3\. Cyber-War and the capitalist unconscious

**[[Cyber war]{.underline}]{.mark}** emerges from and [**[is shaped
by]{.mark}**]{.underline} the interaction of **[[inter-capitalist
rivalries, class war]{.mark}, technological revolutions]{.underline}**
and both progressive and reactionary social movements, producing an
extremely complex diagram. What we might call [the horizontal [axis of
inter-state conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}, with which many cyber war
accounts begin, [[has]{.mark} to be seen in relation to a vertical axis
tha[t pits]{.mark} these same rival [states against]{.mark} a seething
mass of]{.underline} (often contradictory) [[digitized resistance
movements]{.underline} (]{.mark}many of which are supported or
[[co-opted by]{.mark} inter-state rivalries in various p[roxy
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}[),]{.mark} with both horizontal and vertical
dynamics arising from, and [feeding into, a common origin-point in
capitalism\'s most recent technological revolution.]{.underline} These
different vectors interact to create a series of zigzagging, diagonal or
swerving alignments whose chaotic tendencies are enhanced by the
decentralization, opacity and velocity of networked interaction.

[This]{.underline} complex [pattern of conflicts can be seen as a
manifestation of global capitalism\'s \"unconscious\"]{.underline} (Tom
sic 2016; Jameson 1991). By this we mean that **[[cyber-war is
symptomatic of]{.mark} features of [the
world-market]{.mark}]{.underline}** unacknowledged **[[in]{.mark} the
[neoliberal discourse of \"globalization]{.mark}\", namely the [profound
aggression and destructiveness intrinsic to]{.mark} an order predicated
on [privatized competition]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While
[neoliberalism]{.underline} of course not only recognises but
enthusiastically [celebrates competition]{.underline} and its associated
\"disruptions\" and \"creative destruction\" as a spur to innovation and
wealth creation[, its official message is that ultimately the
\"invisible hand\" of the market anneals this into the greater good of
optimal resource allocation.]{.underline} **[What is denied is the
possibility [that this competitive agonistic system might
explode]{.mark} into non-creative destruction]{.underline}**, and that
the ultimate \"disruption\" is to be found in the horror of war.
**[[Cyber-war is a]{.mark} secretive but increasingly present irruption
of this possibility, a partially contained yet [intensifying expression
of the world market\'s disintegrative tendencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
As aspects of the opaque and undeclared but deeply penetrative
refashioning of social subjects by cyber-war we include the following
points:

\* Cyber-war is \"crepuscular\" (Virilio 2002).
[[Cyber-war]{.underline}]{.mark} as neither simply a fabrication of
cyber-security experts (Blunden & Cheung 2013; Rid 2013) nor the
imminent equivalent of nuclear war, as some of those experts suggest
(Clark 2011). It [belongs rather neither war nor peace, as form of
[shadow hostility]{.mark} that is compatible with and cross cuts
officially civil relations between states]{.underline} (e.g. US
relations with Russia and China) and the outbreak of kinetic conflicts
(Syria, Ukraine). [It is neither identical to nor separate
from]{.underline} either [conventional war]{.underline} or peace time
signals intelligence operations, [but is rather [the persistent
background noise]{.mark}]{.underline} or \"ceiling\" (2013) [[of
capital\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} new cold (and hot) wars, and its
[[endemic class wars.]{.underline}]{.mark}

■ Cyber-war is mystifying. It is well recognized that cyber-war
operations pose an \"attribution problem\" because of the tendency to
\"obliterate proof\" (Filiol 2011) of its perpetrators. Although many of
these attribution problems are convincingly solved, sometimes
surprisingly quickly (Hansen 2013), they nevertheless invest questions
of war and peace, security and risk with a deep murkiness and
proliferating anxieties and paranoia.

[[Cyber-war as marketized]{.underline}]{.mark} (or privatized) [war-in
[which the state\'s **\"monopoly of violence\" is reinforced and
undermined by** ]{.mark}**private actors, [hacker armies]{.mark},
corporate \"hack-backs\", for profit cyber-security firms and
consultancies**]{.underline} (Harris 2014), **[so that [the \"military
industrial\" complex\'s]{.mark} of national security states become more
and [more interfaced with criminal markets and \"the dark
web]{.mark}]{.underline}**\", and increasingly dependent by corporate
collaborations, which can both enable and constrain state power (for
example, the PRISM compliance between the NSA and giant
info-corporations followed by \"encryption\" conflicts between FBI and
Apple etc). **[[Cyber-war]{.mark} thus [becomes]{.mark} a domain
[beyond]{.mark}]{.underline}** public oversight and democratic
**[[control.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Cyber-war is a]{.underline} new way of [clandestine mobilization and
disciplining of populations]{.underline}. The mass mobilizations of huge
armies are thought of as past, but [[cyber-war offers both states and
movements new forms of recruitment]{.underline},]{.mark} beyond the
professional armies, whether by induction into patriotic hacking,
[Anonymous-style scrip- hacking]{.underline} or jihadist virtual
interpellation. By the same token it also sets in motion, through
surveillance, a new militarized panopticism, capable of both highly
personalized targeting of suspects (Duncan 2014) and the generalized
repressive chilling of networks (Deibert 2013).

[[Cyber-war]{.underline}]{.mark} is increasingly automated, operating by
malware implantation, bot -nets, chat bots, the tweaking of algorithmic
filter- bubbles, big-data scanning surveillance and the \"kill-chains\"
of drone-warfare (Deibert 2013; Cockburn 2015; Shaw 2016). It thus
[[becomes a machinic capitalist unconsci]{.mark}ous, a subterranean
process in [which the participants are made
unwittingly]{.mark}]{.underline} or at least unthinkingly
[[complicit]{.mark} by their everyday involvement in a ubiquitously
networked social context.]{.underline}

This subterranean militarized digital environment poses contemporary
anti-capitalist movements with difficult dilemmas about how, when or if
to practice networked organization, whose speed and secrecy offer some
powerful advantages, but also confound the slower processes of mundane
organization and are intensely vulnerable to surveillance and
cyber-crackdowns. **[Future Marxist [revolutionaries, operating
under]{.mark} conditions of [surveillance and sous veillance, viral
information and disinformation,]{.mark} encryption and
encryption-breaking, [anonymization,]{.mark} verification,
authentication, and [algorithmic digital war, will have to
make]{.mark}]{.underline}** constant strategic and **[[tactical
decisions a]{.mark}bout]{.underline}** whether to adopt **[cyber-war
techniques.]{.underline}** The resort to cyber-war by state actors,
their proxies, and their terrorist opponents means that opposition to
militarization of the digital is an important arena of organization,
**[[mobilizing popular sentiment against the]{.mark} enlarged scope of
[state and corporate mass surveillance, viral propaganda, covert malware
operations, and]{.mark}]{.underline}**, more broadly pressing against
the **[aggressive [disorders of the world market]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Paradoxically, however, as Snowden, Wikileaks and Anonymous have shown,
revealing the scope of the destruction, actual and potential, inflicted
by global capitalism\'s new wave of wars and cyber-wars itself requires
hacker ingenuity. Therefore **[[the best]{.underline}]{.mark}** current
**[[revolutionary strategy may be the]{.underline}]{.mark}** paradoxical
one of (to renew another phrase from the archive of the left) \"Krieg
dem Krieg\", \"war on war\" (Nation 2009, or in this case,
\"**[[cyber-war on cyber-war\".]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Link -- Cyberwar

#### Visions of [cyber war]{.underline} are conjured by [catastrophic apocalypticism]{.underline} -- interpreting [benign attacks]{.underline} to construct immanent '[cyber-doom scenarios]{.underline}' which justifies [imperial expansion]{.underline} in the pursuit of [security]{.underline}.

of Time," 4-25-2013, doi: 10.2139/ssrn.2256370)//ILake-MO

Anatomy of an Apocalypse

[[Apocalyptic thinking is]{.mark} inherently
**[eschatological]{.mark}**,]{.underline} interpreting history through
the prism of finitude: [contemporary [**events** are]{.mark} imbued with
**eschatological meaning** and are [interpreted as]{.mark}
'**[signs]{.mark}**' [of]{.mark} impending
**[apocalypse]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Robbins and Palmer, 1997: 4-5).
[The roll-call of signs of cyber war will be familiar: Cuckoo's Egg,
Eligible Receiver, Morris Worm, ILOVEYOU, Code Red, [Estonia]{.mark},
[Georgia]{.mark}, Conficker, Operation Aurora, [Stuxnet]{.mark}, Flame,
Duqu, and so on.]{.underline} This litany of signs---although internally
heterogeneous---imparts metonymic gravitas to cyber war narratives and
fulfils a significant mnemonic function in reminding audiences
continually of the seriousness of cyber threats. [They [become]{.mark}
'[**signifiers** of the]{.mark} no-longer-future-but-[**reality of
cyber-war**']{.mark}]{.underline} (Cavelty, 2013). Their historical
specificity is elided in their construction as discrete events, the
frequency of which is always increasing (e.g. Herrera-Flanigan, 2013),
and which lead inevitably to cyber war. Prophets who read and pronounce
upon these apocalyptic signs---the 'Cassandras of cyber warfare' (Rid,
2012: 6)---do not, like their religious counterparts, restrict
themselves to specific dates and times upon which terrible events will
occur, so need not excuse themselves from incorrect predictions;
consequently, they can never be wrong. However, they do have in common
talents as 'masterful bricoleurs, skilfully recasting elements and
themes within the constraints of their respective traditions and
reconfiguring them to formulate new, meaningful endtimes scenarios'
(Wojcik, 1997: 148). [Specific [**vectors** of]{.mark} '**[cyber
insecurity]{.mark}**' [may change]{.mark}, and timescales expand and
contract, [but the **certainty**]{.mark} in apocalypse [remains
**unwavering**]{.mark}. '**[Apocalyptic intensity]{.mark}**' [is]{.mark}
maintained and **[heightened]{.mark}** further [by making
continued]{.mark} 'imminent but indeterminate' [**predictions**,
legitimising]{.mark} a [constant]{.mark} state of
**[readiness]{.mark}**]{.underline} in which adherents 'feel themselves
to be standing poised on the brink of time' (Bromley, 1997: 36). In
fact, it is always 'only a matter of time' before a 'cyber-apocalypse'
occurs (Gable, 2010). [This uncertainty is shared with other [forms of
**security**]{.mark}, which [**thrive** on]{.mark} a 'denotative
**[imprecision]{.mark}**]{.underline} \.... [simultaneous appeal to the
hard and the vacuous, the precise and the imprecise]{.underline} \....
[vague generalities about everything and nothing']{.underline} (Walker,
1997: 63). This epistemic tension is partially resolved by reading the
signs of cyber war as corroboration of a deterministic 'script' of the
future (Robbins and Palmer, 1997: 5). [When events and scenarios
converge, the narrative of cyber war **gains** explanatory power in its
own right.]{.underline} In periods of 'thickened history' like this, it
becomes ever more difficult to comprehend these events---'to see the
wood for the trees', as it were---and they become part of their own
causal structure (Beissinger, 2002: 27). In this case, the impression is
that if cyber war is not already occurring, it very soon will be.

The initiation of the apocalypse is frequently reduced to the familiar
digital motif of a finger hovering above the button or positioned in
readiness for a final, decisive mouse-click or emphatic keystroke:
'There was a time when war was begun with a sho. Now it can begin with
the simple click of a mouse. A silent attack that you may never even
know occurred until it all unfolds in front of you' (Rudd, 2011). During
the early Cold War, the image of the US president's finger poised above
a 'nuclear button' became the standard symbol of state military power
(Strong, 2005: 34) but [[in]{.mark} an age of [**cyber war**, the power
to foment]{.mark} **societal [chaos]{.mark}** [is available to
all]{.mark}:]{.underline} as UK armed forces minister Nick Harvey
warned, ['[the finger]{.mark} hovering over the button [could be
**anyone**]{.mark} from a **state** to a **student'**]{.underline}
(Hopkins, 2011). The difficulties of representing cyber threats visually
(Hansen and Nissenbaum, 2009: 1165) partially explain the popularity of
this imagery but like the nuclear case---for which substantial visual
resources were available---there is semantic power in this reduction of
immense sociotechnical complexity to a simple manual action (Plotnick,
2012). Like the informational bits mediating the human will to prosecute
these actions, the decision to proceed is also binary: on/off, yes or
no. [[We might **never know** who hit us or why but this]{.mark} single
[physical act brings the future]{.mark} rushing catastrophically [into
the present]{.mark}, the moment of 'cosmic ecstasy']{.underline}
(Chernus, 1982) [[in which]{.mark} all [**apocalyptic predictions** are
**validated**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This suggests [**apocalypse** is]{.mark} also [an **object of desire**,
something to be]{.mark} welcomed and, perhaps, **[brought into
being]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Cook, 2004). Apocalypse is not merely
the end but also a beginning, a time of both revelation and
transformation. [[An **apocalyptic belief** in]{.mark} the
**[transformation]{.mark}** of the human condition [through
**catastrophe** informs]{.mark} the rhetoric of, [for instance,
the]{.mark} US-led '**[war on terror]{.mark}**' [as much as]{.mark} it
does the **[jihadism]{.mark}** of those who prompted it]{.underline}
(McLaren, 2002; Jackson, 2005: 103-105), even if the utopian ideal of
achieving a 'terror'-free world is as unlikely as Islamist dreams of
global caliphate (Gray, 2007). They remain visions no matter how hard
one strives to achieve them and are part of a 'catastrophic' strand of
apocalypticism, pitting good against evil and privileging dystopian and
pessimistic views of human nature (Wessinger, 1997). [[Cyber war
scenarios]{.mark} frequently [express this]{.mark} **catastrophic
[apocalypticism]{.mark}**[, yet]{.mark} these [eventualities are
not]{.mark} entirely **[unwelcomed]{.mark}**. Cyber war as [apocalypse

moment of the greatest darkness and danger' (Aho, 1997: 65), [a
[**light** to dispel the **night** of]{.mark} political foot-dragging
and [**insufficient** cyber **security**]{.mark}. The catastrophic
materialisation of the '**virtual' threat** is the necessary
**catalyst** through which to achieve this
**transformation**.]{.underline} In this respect, apocalypse operates in
its primary sense of 'revelation', a 'singular instant both revealing
the meaning of the past and announcing the future' (Bousquet, 2006:
756), in this case the political errors of the past and the sunlit
uplands of a 'cyber secure' future.

#### Deflection

**Morefield, 19** -- Professor of Politics at Whitman College. (Jeanne
Morefield, "Trump's Foreign Policy Isn't the Problem," *Boston Review*,
1-8-2019, Available Online:
<https://bostonreview.net/articles/jeanne-morefield-tk/)//ILake-MO>

Trump's willingness to say such things has precipitated an existential
crisis in the international relations world. U.S. foreign policy, as an
academic discourse and political practice, is built on the delicate
foundation of what Robert Vitalis has called [the "**norm against
noticing**," This **deflective move** has long been the gold standard of
**i**nternational **r**elations; under its rules of play, IR experts act
as if the United States has **never** been an **imperial power** and
that its foreign policy is not, and has never been, **intentionally
racist**.]{.underline} The norm against noticing thus distinguishes
between the idea of the United States as a necessary world-historical
actor and the reality of how the United States acts.

In that reality, [the **U**nited **S**tates has long been an imperial
power with **white nationalist** aspirations.]{.underline} Given the
racialized nature of U.S. imperial expansion, it makes sense that Alexis
de Tocqueville predicted, in a chapter entitled "The Three Races of the
United States," that the United States would one day govern "the
destinies of half the globe." In its early days, while still a
slave-holding country, [the **U**nited **S**tates asserted its
sovereignty through genocide on a continental scale and **annexed**
large portions of northern **Mexico**. The country went on to
**overthrow** the independent **state of Hawaii**, **occupied** the
**Philippines and Haiti**, exerted its **regional power** throughout
**Latin America**, expanded its **international hegemony** after World
War II, and became what it is today: the world's **foremost military**
and **nuclear power**]{.underline} with a \$716 billion "defense" budget
that exceeds the spending of all other major global powers combined.

["Taking over from the **British Empire** in the early
twentieth-century," argues James Tully, the **U**nited **S**tates has
used its many **military bases** located "**outside** its own
**borders**"]{.underline}---now nearly 800 in over 80 countries--- to
force open-door economic policies and antidemocratic regimes on states
throughout the formerly colonized world. [An extremely partial list of
**sovereign governments** that the United States either **overthrew** or
**attempted to subvert** through military means, assassinations, or
election tampering since 1949 includes Syria, Iran, Guatemala, Lebanon,
the Congo, Cuba, Chile, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Grenada, Cuba, Korea,
Vietnam, Cambodia, Iraq, Yemen, Australia, Greece, Bolivia, and
Angola.]{.underline} Such interventionist policies have contributed
substantially to today's inegalitarian world in which an estimated 783
million people live in profound poverty. [In sum, for untold
**millions** of humans in the **Global South**, the seventy years of
worldwide order, security, and prosperity that Ikenberry and Deudney
associate with **Pax Americana** has **been anything but** ordered,
secure, or prosperous.]{.underline}

[And yet the norm against noticing prevents foreign policy analysis from
even acknowledging---let alone grappling with---the relationship between
**race** and **imperialism** that has characterized U.S.
**i**nternational **r**elations]{.underline} from the country's earliest
days. This regime of politely un-seeing---of deflecting---connections
between U.S. foreign policy, race hierarchy, and colonial administration
was clearly not in effect when Foreign Affairs was released under its
original name: the Journal of Race Development. This began to change,
however, in the 1920s. Among other contributing factors, World War I,
the rise of anti-colonial revolutions, and the emergence of liberal
internationalism as a popular ideology helped convince foreign policy
experts in the United States and Europe to adopt a policy language
oriented toward "development" rather than imperialism or racial
difference. [Mainstream **i**nternational **r**elations scholarship
today remains committed to a narrative in which the discipline itself
and U.S. foreign policy has always been and remains **race blind**,
concerned solely with the relationship between **sovereign states** who
cooperate, deter, or compete with one another in a global
system]{.underline} in which the United States is simply, like Caesar,
the "first citizen" (Ikenberry) or "the luckiest great power in modern
history" (Walt). For liberals, this involves a studied erasure of the
imperial origins of twentieth-century internationalism in the League of
Nations' Mandate system and the complicity of Woodrow Wilson in
preserving, as Adom Getachew puts it, "white supremacy on a global
scale." [For realists, it requires both **forgetting** the
anti-Enlightenment **origins** of postwar realist thought and
**reinserting** the "**security dilemma**" **back into history** so
that, with the help of Thucydides, Machiavelli, and Hobbes, the world
can]{.underline}---as Slavoj Žižek says---"become what it always was."

[**I**nternational **r**elations experts will acknowledge U.S. violence
and overreach when necessary, but routinely read the illiberalism of
U.S. foreign policy as an **exception** that is not at all
**representative**,]{.underline} in Anne Marie Slaughter's words, of
"the idea that is America." Slaughter, with Ikenberry, can consider bad
behavior only briefly and only in the service of insisting that what
matters most is not what the United States actually does with its power
but what it intends to do. [Yes, "imperialism, slavery, and racism have
marred Western history," Ikenberry and Deudney argue, but what matters
is that liberalism "has always been at the forefront of efforts---both
peaceful and militant---to reform and end these practices."]{.underline}
Indeed, even those public intellectuals such as Niall Ferguson and
Michael Ignatieff who, after September 11, called for the United States
to embrace its status as an imperial power, framed their arguments in
deflective, liberal terms. By contrast, [because realists project the
security dilemma **retroactively** into history (while also
simultaneously ex**cising imperialism**) they can only see the U.S.
destabilization of Third World economies, assassinations, and secret
bombings as **tragic necessities**]{.underline} (great powers, claims
Mearsheimer, "have little choice but to pursue power and to seek to
dominate the other states in the system") or as the result of liberals'
ill-advised desire to force "our" values on other nations. [Both of
these **deflective strategies** reinforce the **illusion** that we
live,]{.underline} in Nikhil Pal Singh's words, [in an
"**American-centered**, **racially inclusive** world, one organized
around formally equal and independent nation states"]{.underline} where
some states just happen to have more power than others, and [where the
alternative---**Russian** or **Chinese** hegemony---is **too
frightening** even to contemplate.]{.underline}

That deflection would play such an outsized role in supporting the
ideological edifice of international relations today is hardly
surprising. Turn-of-the-century British liberals who supported their
empire also drew upon a variety of different deflective strategies to
reconcile the violence and illiberalism of British imperial expansion
with the stated liberal goals of the Empire. Such deflection made it
impossible for these thinkers---many of whom would go on to work as some
of the first international relations scholars in Britain and help found
The Royal Institute of International Affairs---to link the problems of
empire with the violence and disruption of imperialism.

[Similarly, deflection within international relations today obscures the
U.S. role in maintaining the profoundly **hierarchical**, **racist**,
**insecure**, deeply **unjust** reality of the current **global
order**.]{.underline} It also makes it impossible to address how U.S.
foreign policy (covert and overt) has contributed to the destabilization
of that order by creating the circumstances that give rise to "failed
states," "rogue regimes," and "sponsors of terrorism." Moreover, it
impedes any theorizing about how the widespread appeal of Trump's
xenophobia at home might, in part, be the product of U.S. foreign policy
abroad, the bitter fruit of the War on Terror and its equally violent
predecessors. In other words, in the grand tradition of liberal empire,
U.S. foreign policy deflection actively disrupts the link between cause
and effect that an entire science of international relations was created
to explain.

### Link -- DPT

#### Democratic peace theory relies on a [liberal]{.underline} conception of [social contract theory]{.underline} which upon which [racial divisions]{.underline} are drawn -- [perpetual peace]{.underline} is a [racist fantasy]{.underline}.

**Henderson, 14** -- Associate Professor of Political Science at
Pennsylvania State University. (Errol A. Henderson, "Hidden in Plain
Sight: Racism in international relations theory," *Race and Racism in
International Relations*, Routledge 2014, pg. 19-40)//ILake-MO

Nevertheless, prominent democratic peace advocates such as Ray (1995, 3)
insist that [[**Kant** provides]{.mark} "an important symbolic as well
as **[substantive]{.mark}** source of [**inspiration** for]{.mark}
advocates of the **[democratic peace]{.mark}**
proposition".]{.underline} For Doyle (1997, 302), [[Kant's
thesis]{.mark} "[lays]{.mark} a special [claim to what world
politics]{.mark} is and [can be: a **state of peace**]{.mark}",
[and]{.mark} it "[claims a special]{.mark} property [right in what
shapes]{.mark} the politics of [**Liberal states** --]{.mark} liberty
and **[democracy]{.mark}**".]{.underline} Russett (1993, 4) is even more
adoring of Kant's "republican constitutionalism", which he asserts is
"compatible with basic contemporary understandings of democracy". [[But
Kant's]{.mark} ethical and [political theory is **unequivocally
racist**]{.mark}: [it **excises**]{.mark} whole [**swathes of humanity**
from its processes]{.mark}.]{.underline} The republicanism Kant espouses
-- in contrast to Russett's claims -- is quite a distance from democracy
popularly conceived: it is a Herrenvolk democracy for whites that
provides for "perpetual peace". Mills (1997, 72) explains that

> [[the embarrassing fact for the **white West**]{.mark} (which

> Modern moral theory and modern racial theory have the same father
> \[emphasis in original\].

[[Mainstream **IR theory**]{.mark} in general [and]{.mark} the
**[democratic peace literature]{.mark}** in particular [are **silent**
on]{.mark} this aspect of [Kant's writing and]{.mark} its [implications
for]{.mark} his "**[perpetual peace]{.mark}**".]{.underline} Similarly,
constructivist arguments such as proffered by Wendt ignore this aspect
of Kantian thought that should inform their understanding of a "Kantian"
state of nature that they insist is orientated toward amicable relations
among states and peoples. Even realist counterarguments to the Kantian
claims of liberal and constructivist neo-Kantians rarely evoke Kant's
racism as a factor undermining his thesis.

[What should be clear is that [the **social contract** theses that
underlie]{.mark} prominent [conceptions of]{.mark} the [**global
anarchy** in which world politics is situated for]{.mark} many
**realists**, idealists/**[liberals]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
constructivists, and some Marxists as well, [[suggest a **racist
dualism**]{.mark} that rests on a fundamental dichotomy with respect to
the emergence of society and, [thus, the conduct of]{.mark} social
affairs for **[whites]{.mark}**, who [are constructed as
**developmentally superior**]{.mark}, and **blacks**, who are
constructed as **developmentally inferior**.]{.underline} Having
discussed briefly the racist dualism in prominent conceptions of the
state of nature derived from Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau and Kant, in the
next section we discuss how the racism that inheres in the social
contract theses became central to the theses of IR theorists who drew on
them to devise the paradigms that continue to orientate the field.

### Link -- NATO

#### The affirmative [recalibrates]{.underline} Global NATO -- [IR concerns]{.underline} of \[security cooperation, great power war, and emerging technologies\] elide an [interrogation]{.underline} of the [blood-soaked network]{.underline} which upholds [imperialism]{.underline}.

The celebration of [**NATO's** 70 years of **existence** provides
another opportunity to unearth the real history of the **ideas**,
**practices** and **destruction** wrought by this **military
alliance**.]{.underline} Even with the clear exposure of the cooperation
between NATO, the CIA and the British MI6 to spread terror and
psychological warfare in Europe immediately after the formation of this
military alliance, [the mainstream **media**, [**academics** and
**policy makers** remain **silent** on]{.mark} activities of
[the]{.mark} 'stay behind [**armies'** and]{.mark} '**[false
flag']{.mark}** [operations that distorted the]{.mark} **real
[causes]{.mark}** [of **insecurity**]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}
after 1945. The evidence of the manipulations of the peoples of the
world to ensure the continued survival of NATO has been well documented
in the fraudulent interventions and bombings in the Balkans right up the
present multiple wars against the peoples of Iran.

Vijay Prashad had identified NATO as the prime defender of the Atlantic
project. [[This **Atlantic project**]{.mark}, he noted was, "[a]{.mark}
fairly straightforward [campaign by the **propertied classes** to
maintain]{.mark} or restore their position of
**[dominance]{.mark}**."]{.underline} This Atlantic Project [[was
**anchored** in]{.mark} the **military alliance** called
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} with its principal work, that of
reversing the South Project; the struggles for peace bread and justice
by the poorer citizens of the planet, especially those who had emerged
on the world stage after the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and the
Caribbean.

The ostensive reason for the founding of NATO was to 'thwart' Soviet
aggression, but in practice the organization was a prop for western
capital and after the fall of the Berlin Wall, became the core prop for
Wall Street. In this year, there will be many commentaries on the fact
that the existence of NATO reflects a Cold War relic, that NATO is
obsolete and lost its mandate, but [[very few]{.mark} will [link]{.mark}
the **expansion of [NATO]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the [**military
management** of the **international system**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Prior
to 1991, the planners of NATO could justify the existence of NATO on
ideological and political grounds, but [[with the threat of a **multi
polar world**]{.mark} and the **diminution of the dollar**, [NATO
**expanded**]{.mark} to the point where this author joined with others
in labelling this organization Global NATO [to reflect its]{.mark}
current **[imperial mandate]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The Global thrust of
NATO now comprises 29 members from Europe and North America along with
41 'partners' that had started off under the banner of the North
Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) in 1991. Since that time, [NATO has
launched a lengthy **war without end** in Afghanistan, **colluded in**
the **destruction** of Iraq and **conspired with militarists** to forge
'Partnership for Peace' (with most members of the former Warsaw Pact
states).]{.underline} The core 29 members are now enmeshed with treaties
and undertakings from states involved in the Mediterranean Dialog and
Istanbul Cooperation Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab
Emirates. There are also the 'partners' from across the globe:
Afghanistan, Australia, Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan. [[This **enlargement** served
the]{.mark} military [purposes of **encircling** **China** and
**Russia**]{.mark} who military planners in the West
**targeted**.]{.underline}

There is no shortage of literature on NATO and its milestones, but [very
[few]{.mark} have [documented]{.mark} the real crimes of [this **global
network** of **anticommunist operatives** who **precipitated**]{.mark}
real [**terror** and **psychological warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline}
against the citizens of Europe and North America while supporting mass
atrocities from Algeria to Indonesia, and South Africa. Books such as
that of NATO's Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western
Europe by Danielle Ganser and The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen
Dulles, and Their Secret World War, by Stephen Kinzer used rigorous
research techniques to uncover the dark history of NATO. These two books
can be [[**distinguished** from]{.mark} the bland
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations texts that discusses
NATO inside the old [**calculations** of]{.mark}
'**[strategy]{.mark}**,' 'concert of democracies', '**[security
cooperation']{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[balance of power]{.mark}**,'
and **spheres of influence**.]{.underline} Most recently, this IR
rendering of the history of NATO has been served up in a document
entitled, NATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis. Published by Harvard
University with one of the coauthors being a former US ambassador to
NATO. This document spelt out ten challenges.\[1\] However, in a
testimony before Congress, Nicolas Burns boiled down the challenge of
NATO to one objective; that the current role of NATO must be to contain
Russia and China.\[2\] On the day before the actual 70thanniversary, on
April 3, [the Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg delivered an address to
a joint session of the US Congress **[advocating]{.mark}** an
[**expansion** of the alliance while promoting]{.mark} a [**military
buildup** against **Russia**]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[3\] European
progressives will have to reflect deeply on whether the current
sanctions regime and the special propose vehicle called the Instrument
in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), is ushering in another round of
inter imperialist rivalry reminiscent of the currency wars of 1929-1939.
Then, [the **[shifting alliances]{.mark}** **[yield]{.mark}**ed
[**confusion** among working peoples who]{.mark} ultimately went to
[fight]{.mark} against [each other]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe,
[**[spreading barbarism]{.mark}** throughout the world,]{.underline}
from Auschwitz to Hiroshima.

The continued struggles for bread, peace and justice ensure that it is
only the authoritarian leaders from the Global South who are compromised
on the real meaning of the existence of NATO. [In the present era, there
is a new **capitalist competition** while North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (**[NATO]{.mark}**) [serves]{.mark} as an integral part of
the Pentagon's world **command structure**.]{.underline} Recent
experiences have demonstrated in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya that the
moguls of Wall Street are willing [[to **wage**]{.mark} as many
**[wars]{.mark}**, to **[destroy]{.mark}** as many [**countries**
and]{.mark} to **[kill]{.mark}** as many people as necessary [to achieve
the **dominance** of]{.mark} **US [capitalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
The destruction of Libya was a classic example of the convergence of
finance as warfare, the weaponization of information and incessant
bombing to destroy a society. Where at the start of NATO the war scare
was the propaganda method, [In [the]{.mark} current **[digital
age]{.mark}**, brain hacking and the engineering of smart phones have
[placed]{.mark} the [giant **technology firms**]{.mark} of Apple,
Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook [at the forefront of the]{.mark} new
[**weapons platform** of **NATO**]{.mark} and Wall Street.]{.underline}
This analysis is in three parts spelling out the rationale for the call
for all progressive forces to join together to concentrate their
energies in the dismantling of NATO.

#### NATO's creation was because of [Whiteness]{.underline}, and Whiteness also shapes responses to crises like the war in Ukraine.

By Amoz JY **Hor**, April 12, **2022** ("NATO was founded to protect
'civilized' people. That means White.", Washington Post, Amoz JY Hor is
a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the George Washington University
whose research agenda concerns emotions and racialization in
international politics, accessed 6/28/2022,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/11/nato-ukraine-refugees-whiteness/>)
//lrap

The invasion of Ukraine has been horrifying to witness.\
Early on, [some observers repeatedly expressed the idea that the
invasion of Ukraine is especially horrifying because]{.underline}, as
CBS reporter Charlie D'Agata, who was in Kyiv, put it, "[This isn't a
place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen
conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilized, relatively
European --- I have to choose those words carefully too ---
city]{.underline}.\" (D'Agata later issued an apology.)\
[People of color are not surprised. **A large body of research finds
that Whiteness informs who is deemed deserving of welfare,
protectionism, property, security, freedom, humanitarianism and more.
NATO's very inception --- too --- was birthed through appeals to
Whiteness.**]{.underline}\
To understand the selective empathy toward Ukraine, here are four
historical examples that illustrate how [**race has always mattered**
when it comes to NATO and the concept of Western
civilization]{.underline}, drawn from a large body of scholarship as
well as my own dissertation research.\
[1. **NATO was born out of a fear of White slavery**]{.underline}\
[American commitments to NATO were born out of the fear that communism
would spread in Europe]{.underline}. However, [communism was seen to
pose a threat]{.underline} not just to "freedom" --- but specifically
[to White freedom]{.underline}, as historian Tyler Stovall and others
have shown.\
In the U.S. South, [communism was seen as synonymous with
desegregation]{.underline}. Looking abroad, arch-segregationist Sen.
James Eastland (D-Miss.) in 1947 explained his support for U.S.
commitments to Europe:\
... there is more slavery on the earth today than at any previous time
in the world's history ... communism is the greatest of all enslavers
\[because\] Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia are the first nations in
modern history which have recognized and practiced the doctrine of human
slavery as applied to the white race. (Note: Emphasis is the author's.)\
2. **[Defending European democracy meant reinforcing colonization
elsewhere]{.underline}**\
[NATO was born as an alliance that protected --- and even funded ---
European colonization]{.underline}. As explicated during the 1948
congressional hearings on [the Marshall Plan]{.underline}, the United
States believed that Europe's postwar economic recovery was crucial to
resisting communism. [Britain, for instance, was to recover through
recolonizing Malaya and its strategic resources --- rubber and
tin]{.underline}. British-controlled Malaya was the second-highest
exporter to the United States before Japan's takeover in World War II.
[Reestablishing this "triangular trade" was so important that the United
States indirectly assisted the suppression of independence movements in
colonial Southeast Asia, culminating in the Vietnam War]{.underline}.\
As one senator would explain during the congressional hearings:\
\[Y\]ou have got Europe ... able to maintain herself because of her
foreign investments. Those foreign investments are largely gone. ...
\[I\]f western Europe and the white race in particular is to carry on,
it has got to be done by ... extension of the new colonial empire ...
\[to\] the nations in Africa. (Note: Emphasis is the author's)\
[3. **Western civilization is code for Whiteness**]{.underline}\
In ways similar to the selective empathy shown toward Ukraine today,
[early advocates of establishing NATO argued that communism posed a
threat to "Western civilization" --- a dog whistle for
Whiteness]{.underline}.\
"Race" has never been denoted solely by skin color but has always been
defined in ways relying on a wide range of physical characteristics such
as the shape or size of someone's nose, eyes or even skull. It has
always relied on cultural markers, such as clothing, diet, behavior,
origin, ancestral heritage or other cultural traits to mark one group as
distinct and inferior or superior from another.\
"[Western civilization" is a term that posits **liberal ideals as the
unique heritage of White people**]{.underline}. For example, in 1949,
[one senator justified the creation of NATO by saying]{.underline}:\
There is not a member of the Senate who does not stem from one of \[the
North Atlantic\] countries. [His forebears came from
Europe]{.underline}. ... We are the result. ... \[T\]his is our hour not
to fail civilization. [Three hundred million persons ... believe in the
great common principles which the race has developed and inherited
through generation after generation]{.underline}." (Note: Emphasis is
the author's)\
[This was not an isolated sentiment]{.underline}. Fifty years before
Samuel Huntington's book "Clash of Civilizations," the term "Western
civilization" was the title of history courses. The most famous was
Arnold [Toynbee's bestseller "A Study of History," in which he
represents "Western Civilization" as the only civilization exclusively
made up of the three White "races" --- Nordic, Alpine and
Mediterranean]{.underline}. (By contrast, [he states that Black "races"
have not contributed to any civilization]{.underline}).\
Because "[Western Civilization" was (or is) understood to be exclusively
made up White "races," the term could function as a surrogate term for
"Whiteness," including in the preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty:
"The Parties to this Treaty ... are determined to safeguard the freedom,
common heritage and civilization of their peoples."]{.underline} (Note:
Emphasis is the author's)\
As one senator elaborated in 1949 hearings, this proposal to "**[defend
our so-called western tradition]{.underline}**" meant "the culmination
of a thousand years \[of\] the Anglo-Saxon \[i.e. White\] people."
Unsurprisingly, what makes Ukrainians' plight so shocking is that "they
seem so like us," so "civilized."\
4. "Slavs" were considered "not quite White"\
It is not racist to feel outraged about the crisis in Ukraine. War and
imperialism are horrifying no matter the victims. Perhaps journalists
are well-intentioned in resorting to whatever sources of sympathy they
can arouse to help fleeing Ukrainians. Nevertheless, we should resist
building solidarity based on something as exclusionary as Whiteness.\
In the United States, Whiteness --- initially restricted to Anglo-Saxons
--- was defined by the constitutional right to not be enslaved. Through
the 1800s, non-Anglo-Saxon European immigrants fought against what they
called wage slavery in the United States --- not on the basis that
freedom was a universal right, but on the basis that "only \[Blacks\]
are slaves" and only Chinese labor is "servile." By becoming "White,"
they gained White freedoms. But they also cemented the idea that [only
Whites are befitting of freedom]{.underline}.\
Slavs --- Russians, Ukrainians, Poles and others --- were likewise
considered "not quite White." One etymological artifact of this history
is that the term "slave" comes from the word "Slav." Even in 1941,
[George Kennan --- famed grand strategist of the early Cold War ---
called Russians "a XVII century semi-Asiatic people" who were
"backwards" and "servile."]{.underline} In 2018, the Wall Street Journal
similarly characterized the crisis as "Russia's Turn to Its Asian Past."
The contingency of "Slavs" as "White" was also on display during
Brexit.\
However, the solution to injustices faced by Eastern Europeans cannot
simply be to extend Whiteness to Ukrainians on the basis that they are
"not obviously refugees ... from North Africa." Observers might instead
extend solidarity to all who struggle for freedom, not just those "like
us."

#### NATO is the "hub" of a "white-dominated alliance system" created by the United States.

RACE AND THE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE WHITE-DOMINANT
INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM\
It is in the above context that one must view the role of race in U.S.
foreign policy as it relates to African states as well as to other
\"nonwhite\" states in the world. [Racial stratification patterns in the
international system have been so established and institutionalized by
international white power that, with few exceptions, the function of the
non-European peoples of the world is that of subsidizing the life styles
of Europeans and supporting continued white domination of the
international system at the expense of the \"nonwhite.\"]{.underline}
The role of the United States is to provide leadership for that portion
of the white world subscribing to what is called democratic capitalism
or democratic socialism in its competition with what is called
communistic socialism.\
In order to fulfill its role, [the United States has set up **an
elaborate white alliance system** which commits millions of people
around the world to defend Euro-American interests. Beginning with
NATO]{.underline}, which, in its full ramifications, is not a simple
alliance of North Atlantic states, since peripherally it includes South
Africa and has considered Brazil and Argentina, in the South Atlantic
(moreover, at least sixteen African states are geographically North
Atlantic states)3 -[NATO is a white alliance system par excellence and
is **the hub of a white-dominated alliance system**]{.underline}.
Beginning with NATO and including SEATO (U.S., U.K., France, New
Zealand, Aus-tralia, Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan), CENTO (U.K.,
Greece, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan), ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand, U.S.),

Korea, Taiwan-[all]{.underline} of these [are
Euro-American-dominated]{.underline}. In Southeast Asia, we find Asians
fighting Asians to protect perceived Euro-American interests. What is
most interesting is that Euro-Americans have not found it necessary to
form multilateral military alliances with black African states-only
economic alliances such as the Common Market and Associated African
States.\
Could it be that such an alliance would be called upon to hold white
supremacist South Africa in check militarily? Or could it be that
economic domination of African-controlled states is sufficient to
protect white interests on the conti- nent? It is both, since the
African commitment to nonalign-ment has not deterred some African states
from striking bilateral military agreements with France, the United
States, and African states. The fact is that [Euro-Americans have become
militarily involved in Africa only to protect perceived white
interests]{.underline}.

Democrats may hate Trump, but they join in white supremacist solidarity
with his aggression against the mostly non-white people of
\[Venezuela\].\
"[It is accepted as normal that the U.S. and Europe have the right and,
indeed, the responsibility to police the world.]{.underline}"\
The hypocrisy and confusion on the issue of race and white supremacy
revealed itself once again in the United States with a governor dressed
in blackface and a decision by the Trump administration and supported by
the European Union to execute a coup against the democratically elected
government of Venezuela.\
And while Virginia Governor Ralph Northam was outed as a racist when
photos surfaced from his yearbook as a medical student in the 1980s that
depicted him in either blackface or in a KKK outfit, [the assumption
that the U.S. and European Union had the right to determine the
leadership of a nation in the global South escaped the same condemnation
as a racist act of white supremacist power]{.underline}.\
The liberal chattering class was quick to condemn this obvious
expression of racism and call for Northam's resignation. But as
journalist Greg Palast points out, the attempts by the oligarchy in
Venezuela to undermine the government is "at its heart, a furious
backlash of the whiter (and wealthier) Venezuelans against their
replacement by the larger Mestizo (mixed-race) poor." Which means that
the intervention by the U.S. is an intervention in support of white
power.\
Yet liberals who pretended to be outraged by the racism of Northam and
had lambasted Trump as a liar and incompetent who colluded with the
Russians to influence the U.S. elections, gave their vocal and
enthusiastic support for the Trump administration's illegal
intervention.\
"The intervention in Venezuela by the U.S. is an intervention in support
of white power."\
How can this be explained? What lesson must the colonized in the global
South and the oppressed peoples and classes trapped in the nations of
the North take from this unity of purpose between the neocons and
liberal interventionists, the liberal bourgeoisie in the U.S. and Europe
and even the general public?\
The answer lies in [the Eurocentric, white supremacist cultural
discourses that **have conditioned the collective consciousness of
Westerners**]{.underline}. The cultural affliction of [Eurocentric,
white supremacist ideology that has permeated all forms of cultural and
ideological expression]{.underline}. [It is not even a point of
contention among the academic and non-academic population, both left and
right, that "liberal" capitalist Europe represents a significant
development in the history of human civilizations, if not the apex of
human development]{.underline}.\
This perspective, from Marxism that sees the capitalist phase as a
necessary and inevitable stage (albeit with contradictions) to
neoliberal globalists, represents [a "commonsense" position embedded in
all Western social institutions that simultaneously normalizes and
invisibilizes behavior informed by the assumptions of white privilege
and prerogatives]{.underline}.\
"White supremacist cultural discourses have conditioned the collective
consciousness of Westerners."\
Therefore, why shouldn't Trump and the Democrats intervene in Venezuela
to determine its leadership, especially when the racial element of that
action is apparently beyond comprehension?\
For the public in the U.S., Gov. Northam and Donald Trump represent the
easy and crude examples of racism that is universally condemned. [But
the assumption that the white West has the right and responsibility to
determine the leadership and way of life of peoples in the global South
doesn't even register as a debatable issue within discourse on white
supremacy]{.underline}.\
It is accepted as normal by the corporate media, most of the
intelligencia and the public that the U.S. and Europe, without any
authorization from any foundational source such as international law or
the United Nations Charter, has the right and indeed the responsibility
to police the world.\
The [lack of debate on this issue and the cavalier attitude that most
have in the West to the real possibilities of yet another military
engagement with a global South nation that will likely result in the
deaths of thousands of human beings reaffirms once again that the value
of human life is stratified; **the more distant that life is from
Europeans** -- geographically, culturally and ethnically -- **the less
value it has**]{.underline}.\
Consequently, the people of the colonized global South fighting for
authentic de-colonization and national self-determination along with the
nationally oppressed peoples and classes in the North must be equally
clear. The European Union Parliament's decision to recognize the puppet
government being imposed on the people of Venezuela is another reminder
that [there is a common enemy in the U.S./EU/NATO "axis of
domination."]{.underline}\
"The value of human life is stratified; the more distant that life is
from Europeans -- geographically, culturally and ethnically -- the less
value it has."\
The constituent elements of this contemporary axis of domination was
established and is sustained as part of what the late Rod Bush referred
to as the Pan-European Project -- the white supremacist,
colonial/capitalist patriarchy -- that began with the invasion of the
"Americas" by Europe in 1492.\
That invasion provided the material basis for Europe moving from a
backwater region of no significance to the various world orders to the
predominant powers on the planet for the last 500 years.\
[It is important to understand, therefore, that the critique of white
supremacy is not limited just to an idealization principle but has a
structural reality]{.underline}. This is what differentiates this
analysis from the simple rejection of racialism or white supremacy
advanced by reform liberals.\
[The analytical and theoretical framework employed here centers and
grounds the relationship between the **institutions and structures of
global white supremacy** -- the IMF, World Bank, WTO, international
financial institutions and dollar hegemony, **NATO** -- and the
ideological expressions of white supremacy such as the belief in the
cultural superiority of Europe, "humanitarian interventions" and the
so-called responsibility to protect]{.underline}.\
There can be no confusion -- despite the sectoral fights inside the
capitalist class that are currently playing out in the intra-class
struggle against Trump -- that the oligarchy is united when it comes to
projecting the dominance of the Pan-European imperialist project in
relationship to the global South. The bipartisan support for the
imperialist agenda was in full display during the State of the Union
speech by Trump when he proudly mentioned U.S. efforts to subvert the
Bolivarian process and in the absence of any opposition to this policy
by Stacy Abrams (and, by extension, Democrats) during her rebuttal.\
What Must Be the Position of Black Radical Internationalists\
Venezuela is just the latest expression of that bipartisan unity of
interests and actions in support of the Pan-European imperialist project
now led by the U.S.\
In the case of Venezuela, we know what will happen if a U.S.-led
military intervention takes place. It will be a replay of the 1989
invasion of Panama, where U.S forces turned the Black community of El
Chorrillo into a "free fire zone," resulting in the complete destruction
of the community and the deaths of over 3,000 Panamanians.\
The people of Venezuela have made a choice. We will not debate the
merits of their process, its contradictions or problems. [Our
responsibility as citizens/captors of empire is to put a brake on the
U.S. state's ability to foist death and destruction on the peoples of
the world]{.underline}.\
However, as it is has been stated in other places, it is imperative that
the Black working class is separated from this naked imperialist move on
Venezuela and all imperialist assaults. African/Black people must be
clear on the issue of U.S. and European capitalist/imperialist
interventions. The war and militarism being waged against Africans/Black
people in the U.S. by the domestic military we call "the police" --
embodied by mass incarceration -- is part of the global Pan-European
axis of domination that is now conspiring against the Bolivarian
revolutionary process in Venezuela.\
"The war on Black people in the U.S. is part of the global Pan-European
axis of domination that is now conspiring against Venezuela."\
Opposition to U.S. imperialism cannot be left up to the so-called
progressives in the Democrat Party or even the Congressional Black
Caucus (CBC). The CBC has consistently backed the white ruling class
agenda of subversion and military intervention, from its support for the
U.S. African Command (AFRICOM) to its failure to oppose the Department
of Defense's 1033 program, responsible for transferring millions of
dollars-worth of military equipment to local police forces that are then
deployed against poor working class black and brown communities.\
Representing the "new" Black managerial/administrative/professional
petit-bourgeoisie that is now physically and psychologically
disconnected from the Black masses, the CBC has completely thrown in its
lot with the owners of capital -- white power.\
That is why the position of the Black Alliance for Peace should be
embraced. BAP says, "not one drop of blood from working class and poor
to defend the interests of the capitalist oligarchy."\
[All rational human beings want peace. But there is no peace without
justice. Real social justice, which requires radical structural change,
cannot be realized without struggle. And **there can be no effective
social change** without clearly identifying the enemy---the source of
our oppression---and being able to imagine an alternative]{.underline}.\
The revolutionary Black working class is clear and building our forces
for **[the fight that must be waged against the U.S./EU/NATO axis of
domination]{.underline}**. The only question is, who will be our allies.

### Link -- Nuclear War

#### The affirmative's study of [nuclear conflict]{.underline} between [sovereign states]{.underline} within an [international system]{.underline} relies on [epistemological whiteness]{.underline} which obscures the [nuclear color line]{.underline}. 

**van Munster, 21** -- International Relations scholar at the Danish
Institute for International Studies. (Rens van Munster, "On whiteness in
critical security studies: The case of nuclear weapons," *Security
Dialogue*, Vol. 52(1), 10-26-2021, [doi:
10.1177/09670106211015029)//ILake-MO](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211015029)//ILake-MO)

The nuclear colour line

Although I take issue with the general approach and some of the larger
conclusions of Howell and Richter-Montpetit, I find their argument that
non-white experiences of (in)security have been theoretically and
empirically marginalized productive. In my own research, [the idea of
**epistemological** or **methodological whiteness** has certainly been
helpful in addressing a core question: to what extent has **nuclear
weapons** scholarship (too) an in-built **whiteness**?]{.underline} This
line of questioning appears particularly pertinent given that, as Benoit
Pelopidas (2016: 326) has noted, nuclear weapons scholarship in security
studies is 'particularly prone' to 'forms of self-censorship' that
suppress normativity and serve to reproduce the status quo and restrict
our political imagination.6

While recent nuclear weapons scholarship in international relations has
sought to recover or develop a more critical perspective on nuclear
weapons technology, this body of work continues to occlude questions of
colonialism and race. For example, Pelopidas's suggestion to ground a
critical research study in the recognition that all nuclear weapons
scholarship is inherently normative given its commitment, in one way or
another, to [the **prevention** of nuclear war remains
**insufficiently** attentive to **non-white** experiences of **nuclear
violence**. It locates nuclear weapons violence in a future that
hopefully never happens, yet **ignores** the multifaceted forms of
nuclear violence]{.underline} that happened in the past and that are
still ongoing today. Since [the **production**, **testing**, (**threat**
of) use and **stockpiling** of nuclear weapons are all deeply entangled
with the violent histories of **imperialism** and
**colonialism**,]{.underline} much of these past and present forms of
nuclear violence disproportionally affect (former) colonial and
non-white populations. A genuinely [critical **study** of **nuclear
weapons** must also include a focus on their **imperial foundations**
and **racial dimensions**, including how the nuclearization of
international politics has shaped non-white experiences of (in)security.
To ignore the '**nuclear colour line**',]{.underline} its history and
fallout, [**severely limits** our understanding of the violent effects
of nuclear weapons and the human costs associated with a security policy
based on deterrence.]{.underline} It is also at odds with the most
recent developments in anti-nuclear discourse, most notably the entry
into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Here,
the illegitimacy of nuclear weapons is argued not just in the context of
warfare, but also in relation to the contaminating and destructive
activities that occur across the entire nuclear fuel cycle (from uranium
mining to radioactive waste disposal).

Recent developments in [black and African American studies offer one
avenue through which to **decentre whiteness** in nuclear weapons
scholarship and **attune** critical security studies to the **racialized
realities** of **nuclear weapons**.]{.underline} A substantial
literature on black internationalism and the anti-nuclear struggle has
existed for a long time, but this scholarship has remained outside
critical security studies -- an occlusion that admittedly also
characterizes my own work on progressive anti-nuclear intellectuals
during the Cold War (Van Munster and Sylvest, 2016).7 Vincent Intondi's
(2015) African Americans Against the Bomb, in particular, offers a
fruitful starting point on which to base such an intellectual
conversation.8 [Intondi shows that African Americans viewed nuclear
weapons from the perspective of **colonialism** and **black liberation**
globally, a perspective that fundamentally challenges the dominant view
in **i**nternational **r**elations that the pursuit of nuclear weapons
can be understood as the **horizontal competition** between **sovereign
states** under conditions of **anarchy**.]{.underline} African Americans
pointed out that [the development of nuclear capabilities critically
relied on the continuation of an unfree **(neo)colonial system** of
rule,]{.underline} including uranium mining in the Congo and the
appropriation of overseas territories as designated test sites.

The foregrounding of race also cuts through the distinction between the
domestic and the international, inside and outside, upon which much
nuclear weapons scholarship in security studies is predicated. African
American intellectuals and activists such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Bayard
Rustin and Martin Luther King strongly resisted the claim that nuclear
weapons were a matter of international politics only and consciously
linked the colonial system in which these weapons were rooted to their
own struggle for freedom and civil rights. [African American critiques
of nuclear weapons **decentre white experiences** and crucially link
nuclear weapons to **structural forms of violence**, including
**racism** and **colonialism**, that are embedded within the larger
social and political **structures** of domestic and international
society.]{.underline} Their uptake in critical security studies would
broaden the intellectual ancestry of nuclear weapons scholarship, while
offering inspiration to the current movement, spearheaded by non-Western
states, to ban the bomb.

Advances in the nuclear humanities and environmental humanities have
generally also been more attentive to (post)colonial and non-white
experiences with nuclear weapons. [In focusing on communities affected
by **uranium mining**, **nuclear testing** and **waste disposal**,
these, too, fundamentally challenge the view that **nuclear weapons**
violence lies in an **abstract future**]{.underline} (Hecht, 2012;
Kuletz, 1998; Stawkowski, 2016). [For example, the focus on communities
affected by nuclear testing offers much-needed nuance to the persistent
myth that nuclear weapons have never been used since the bombing of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a belief that continues to inform both formal
**theories of strategy**]{.underline} and post-structuralist critique.
For example, Jacques Derrida (1984: 23) maintained as late as 1984 that
the 'fabulously textual' phenomenon of nuclear weapons first and
foremost depends 'upon structures of information and communication,
structures of language, including non-vocalizable language, structures
of codes and graphic decoding'. [The emphasis on nuclear weapons as
discursive entities with **symbolic power** in a game of **signalling**
contrasts sharply with **non-white** experiences with this technology
and serves to **conceal** the real **violence** nuclear tests enacted
upon **indigenous communities** and their lands.]{.underline} Such
communities had no stake in the production and acquisition of nuclear
weapons, yet are the ones affected most by their development. Indeed,
[nuclear powers detonated scores of bombs on colonial or dependent
territories, including Algeria, French Polynesia, the aboriginal
Australian territories of Maralinga, Emu Field and Monte Bello Island,
and the Marshall Islands.]{.underline} In short, when it comes to
nuclear weapons, tests are not just tests: they are [experiments that
reflect deeply **racial** and **geographic hierarchies** of
worth]{.underline} (Barker and Johnston, 2008; Immerwahr, 2019).

[The study of such **hierarchies** also complicates the dominant
perspective of nuclear weapons violence as highly **spectacular** and
**world-ending**.]{.underline} Whereas the danger of a nuclear war that
results in the immediate death of millions of people across the planet
remains a real risk, [the ongoing continuous suffering of communities
exposed to nuclear testing (as well as other nuclear activities) draws
attention to the more intricate, **less spectacular** and **less
visible** ways in which nuclear weapons perform their **everyday
violence**.9 For these communities, the original violence of the
explosion has long since mutated into]{.underline} what Rob Nixon (2011:
2) has referred to as ['**slow violence'**, 'a violence that occurs
gradually **and out of sight**, a violence of **delayed destruction**
that is dispersed across time and space, an attritional violence that is
typically not viewed as violence at all'.]{.underline} The extent to
which 'slow violence' is the right term to capture such events is a
matter of debate, but one of its advantages is that it enables a
discussion of nuclear violence that temporally as well as spatially
reaches beyond the moment of detonation. Leaking radioactive waste,
irradiated landscapes and contamination continue to shape the
postcolonial realities of those that have been forcefully removed from
their lands or suffer from radiation-related illnesses. [**Gradual
deaths**, **radiation sickness**, **biological mutations**,
**geographical displacement** and **intergenerational trauma** must all
be included among the central human experiences of what it means to
live, die and survive in the **nuclear age**.]{.underline}

### Link -- Ukraine

#### Ukraine is a [link]{.underline}, not uniqueness -- the 1AC's narrative of [inter-imperialist conflict]{.underline} is complicit in upholding a [civilizational order]{.underline} which [hyper-values whiteness]{.underline} and [dehumanizes racialized others]{.underline}. 

**Baraka, 22** -- Editor and contributing columnist for the Black Agenda
Report and contributing columnist for Counterpunch. (Ajamu Baraka, "A
new consensus on Whiteness?" *Black Agenda Report*, 3-21-2022, Available

https://blackagendareport.com/ukraine-new-consensus-whiteness)//ILake-MO

However, in this short essay I want to address something even more
insidious and dangerous than the general propaganda efforts to generate
support for the war against Russia, and that is: [in the process of
building support for war, [the **white supremacist**]{.mark},
**[ultranationalist]{.mark}**, and neo-Nazi [elements in **Ukrainian**
society and]{.mark} in the [state were]{.mark} **downplayed**, if not
**[ignored]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[That **whitewashing**, [coupled with]{.mark} the inordinate attention
given to the war, with the inevitable sympathy for the **white victims**
of this war--[a war motivated by the desire]{.mark} of Ukrainians to
join Europe, [to]{.mark} "**[defend Europeanness]{.mark}**," [and
**European**]{.mark} "**[civilization]{.mark}**"--[revealed a
contradiction]{.mark} that has always been present [at the heart
of]{.mark} the emergence of what became [Europe]{.mark}. That
**contradiction** was [the **hyper-valuation** of]{.mark} white lives,
of "**[whiteness]{.mark}**," [in relationship to]{.mark} the
**[racialized]{.mark}** "**[others]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} a
contradiction that I refer to as the "white lives matter more movement."

[[This whitewashing]{.mark} of Ukraine [is]{.mark} particularly
[dangerous]{.mark} because it is occurring [at a]{.mark} historical
[moment of]{.mark} deep [crisis for the]{.mark} **global [capitalist
order]{.mark}**[, producing]{.mark} proto-[**fascist movements** across
Europe]{.mark} that are becoming more visible and bolder.]{.underline}
As I said in previous writings on this subject, [U.S. authorities and
the U.S. and Western European press understood that Ukraine had an
active problem with white supremacist ultranationalists and literal
neo-Nazis.]{.underline} Nevertheless, in order to engender support for
Ukraine and to set the stage for the performance of a lifetime by
Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's actor president, Ukraine had to be
recreated, minus the ultranationalist influence and Nazis.

Herein lies the danger for non-Europeans.

The coup in 2014 saw for the first time since the second world-war,
literal neo-Nazis serving in the government of a European state.
Moreover, [even though the ultranationalists and neo-Nazis did not have
a commanding electoral base, their non-state presence controlling the
streets of major cities and towns across Ukraine was significant. They
were [notorious for]{.mark} their [**attacks** on **LGBTQ**
populations]{.mark}, anarchists, **[non-Europeans]{.mark}**, and Roma
peoples.]{.underline} Their violent opposition to communists and
communism and socialism of any sort was officially amplified with
repressive legislation that outlawed and repressed most left political
tendencies.

Beginning in 2014, white supremacists from throughout the European world
traveled to Ukraine, with over four thousand "volunteers" traveling to
Ukraine recently to fight in response to Zelensky's call to help fight
the Russians. It did not matter to Zelensky or the European nations
supplying weapons and paying the salaries of these "volunteers" that
most of them were self-identified white supremacists.

Again, we do not need to make the case of the presence of these forces
in Ukraine. That has already been done, here, here, and here. [The
political issue is that [the **sanitizing** of the
**right-wing**]{.mark} Ukrainian state [has **strengthened** the
**far-right**]{.mark} not only in Ukraine but **[globally]{.mark}**. The
whitewashing by liberals and the liberal/left in the U.S. that
transformed these elements into "moderate" Nazis is having the effect of
**[legitimizing]{.mark}** their **[proto-fascist racialized
politics]{.mark}**, a politics that is emerging across the white
world.]{.underline} There is a reason Marine LePen has a chance to
defeat Emmanuel Macron, even after he moved further to the right after
being elected.

The invasion of Ukraine has been horrifying to witness.

Early
on, [some](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/28/ukraine-coverage-media-racist-biases/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4) observers [repeatedly](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/27/western-media-coverage-ukraine-russia-invasion-criticism) [expressed](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/charlie-dagata-cbs-apology-ukraine-iraq-b2024265.html) [the
idea](https://twitter.com/saratu/status/1497700938269835269) that the
invasion of Ukraine is especially horrifying because, as CBS reporter

European]{.underline} --- I have to choose those words carefully too ---

To understand the selective empathy toward Ukraine, [here are four
historical examples that illustrate how race has always mattered when it
comes to NATO and the concept of Western civilization, drawn from a
large body of scholarship]{.underline} as well as my own dissertation
research.

[1. NATO was born out of a fear of White slavery]{.underline}

American commitments to NATO were born out of the fear
that [communism](https://www.vub.be/sites/vub/files/nieuws/users/bcoppiet/118risse.pdf) would
spread in Europe. **[However, communism was seen to pose a threat not
just to "freedom" --- but specifically to [White
freedom](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691179469/white-freedom),
as historian Tyler Stovall and others have shown.]{.underline}**

In the U.S.
South, [communism](https://lsupress.org/books/detail/black-struggle-red-scare/) was
seen as synonymous
with [desegregation](https://uncpress.org/book/9781469613871/defending-white-democracy/).
Looking abroad, arch-segregationist Sen. James Eastland (D-Miss.) in
1947 [explained](https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1947/04/11/senate-section) his
support for U.S. commitments to Europe:

[... there is more slavery on the earth today than at any previous time
in the world's history ... communism is the greatest of all enslavers
\[because\] Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia are the first nations in
modern history which have recognized and practiced the doctrine of human
slavery as applied to the white race.]{.underline} (Note: Emphasis is
the author's.)

amnesia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/22/calling-ukrainian-refugees-more-civilized-than-syrians-requires-willful-amnesia/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_15)

**2. [Defending European democracy meant reinforcing colonization
elsewhere]{.underline}**

[NATO was born as an alliance that protected --- and even funded ---
European colonization.]{.underline} As explicated during the 1948
congressional hearings on the Marshall Plan, the United States believed
that Europe's postwar economic recovery was crucial to resisting
communism[. Britain, for instance, was to recover through recolonizing
Malaya and its strategic resources --- rubber and tin.]{.underline}
British-controlled Malaya was the second-highest exporter to the United
States before Japan's takeover in World War II. [Reestablishing this
"triangular trade" was so important that the United States [indirectly
assisted](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24914471?seq=1) the suppression
of independence movements in colonial Southeast Asia, [culminating in
the Vietnam
War](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801419584/the-path-to-vietnam/).]{.underline}

As one senator would explain during the congressional hearings:

\[Y\]ou have got Europe ... able to maintain herself because of her
foreign investments. Those foreign investments are largely gone. ...

3\. Western civilization is code for Whiteness

In ways similar to the selective empathy shown toward Ukraine today,
[early advocates of establishing NATO argued that [communism posed a
threat to "Western
civilization"](https://www.press.umich.edu/155781/civilizing_the_enemy) ---
a dog whistle for Whiteness.]{.underline}

"Race" has never been denoted solely by skin color but has always been
defined in ways relying
on [a](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nationalities-papers/article/racism-and-nationalism/B41832A63712E513B3B5F3C09B8DEEF5) [wide](https://www.mediaed.org/transcripts/Stuart-Hall-Race-the-Floating-Signifier-Transcript.pdf) [range](https://www.versobooks.com/books/4019-racecra) of
physical characteristics such as the shape or size of someone's nose,
eyes or even skull. It has always relied on cultural markers, such
as [clothing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1468796812448022), [diet](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/drawing-the-global-colour-line/6086724C986974CCE003AC628986E36F), [behavior](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-southeast-asian-studies/article/abs/myth-of-the-lazy-native-a-study-of-the-image-of-the-malays-filipinos-and-javanese-from-the-16th-to-the-20th-century-and-its-function-in-the-ideology-of-colonial-capitalism-by-syed-hussein-alatas-frank-cass-colondon-1977-pp-267-bibliography-abbreviations-index-hardcover-950/55872C0382367C351D07460A5826161B), [origin](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1070289X.2018.1543831), [ancestral

other [cultural
traits](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Race_and_Racialization/yitBhzsd9OIC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=balibar+neo+racism&pg=PA83&printsec=frontcover) to
mark one group as distinct and [inferior or
superior](https://monoskop.org/images/a/a5/Fanon_Frantz_Black_Skin_White_Masks_1986.pdf) from
another.

**[["Western
civilization"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/09/western-civilisation-appiah-reith-lecture) is
a term that posits liberal ideals as the unique heritage of White
people. For example, in 1949, one
senator [justified](https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1949/07/07/senate-section) the
creation of NATO by saying:]{.underline}**

[There is not a member of the Senate who does not stem from one of \[the
North Atlantic\] countries. His forebears came from Europe. ... We are
the result. ... \[T\]his is our hour not to fail
civilization.]{.underline} Three hundred million persons ... believe in
the great common principles which the race has developed and inherited
through generation after generation." (Note: Emphasis is the author's)

This was not an isolated sentiment. Fifty years before Samuel
Huntington's book "Clash of Civilizations," the term "Western
civilization" was the title
of [history](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320950722_'Western'_and_'White_Civilization'_White_Nationalism_and_Eurocentrism_at_the_Crossroads) [courses](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/105/3/770/23403?login=true).
The most famous was Arnold Toynbee's bestseller "[A Study of
History](https://nyupress.org/9780853459613/inventing-western-civilization/),"
[in which he represents "Western Civilization" as the only civilization
exclusively made up of the three White "races" --- Nordic, Alpine and
Mediterranean. (By contrast, he states that Black]{.underline} "races"
have not contributed to any civilization).

Because "Western Civilization" was (or is) understood to be exclusively
made up White "races," the term could function as a surrogate term for
"Whiteness," including in [the preamble of the North Atlantic
Treaty](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/history_pdf/20161122_E1-founding-treaty-original-treaty_NN-en.pdf):
["The Parties to this Treaty ... are determined to safeguard the
freedom, common heritage and civilization of their
peoples]{.underline}." (Note: Emphasis is the author's)

As one senator [elaborated in 1949
hearings](https://www.congress.gov/bound-congressional-record/1949/07/11/senate-section),
[this proposal to "defend our so-called western tradition" meant "the
culmination of a thousand years \[of\] the Anglo-Saxon \[i.e. White\]
people." Unsurprisingly, what makes Ukrainians' plight so shocking is
that ["they seem so like us," so
"civilized."](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/02/civilised-european-look-like-us-racist-coverage-ukraine)]{.underline}

4\. "Slavs" were considered "not quite White"

[It is not racist to feel outraged about the crisis in Ukraine. War and
imperialism are horrifying no matter the victims.]{.underline} Perhaps
journalists are well-intentioned in resorting to whatever sources of
sympathy they can arouse to help fleeing Ukrainians. **[Nevertheless, we
should resist
building [solidarity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/15/dont-forget-ukraine-refugee-crisis/?itid=lk_inline_manual_36) [based](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/15/dont-forget-ukraine-refugee-crisis/?itid=lk_inline_manual_36) [on](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/03/anti-black-racism-is-upending-easy-narratives-about-historic-exodus-ukraine/?itid=lk_inline_manual_36) [something](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/2/more-racism-at-ukrainian-borders) as
exclusionary as Whiteness.]{.underline}**

[In the United
States](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-abolition-of-white-democracy),
Whiteness --- initially restricted to Anglo-Saxons --- was defined by
the constitutional right to not be enslaved[. [Through the
1800s](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674951914),
non-Anglo-Saxon European immigrants fought against what they called wage
slavery in the United States --- not on the basis that freedom was a
universal right, but on the basis that ["only \[Blacks\] are
slaves"](https://www.versobooks.com/books/255-the-wages-of-whiteness) and [only
Chinese labor is
"servile](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/drawing-the-global-colour-line/6086724C986974CCE003AC628986E36F)."
By [becoming](https://www.routledge.com/Racial-Formation-in-the-United-States/Omi-Winant/p/book/9780415520317) ["White,"](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393339741) they
gained White freedoms. But they also cemented the idea that only Whites
are befitting of freedom.]{.underline}

Slavs --- [Russians, Ukrainians, Poles and others --- were likewise
considered "not quite White."]{.underline} One etymological artifact of
this history is that the term
["slave" [comes](https://nyupress.org/9780814798935/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-caucasian-race/) [from](https://uncpress.org/book/9781469663722/black-marxism-revised-and-updated-third-edition/) the
word "[Slav](https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=slave)." Even
in 1941, [George
Kennan](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/catalog/MC076_c03088) ---
famed grand strategist of the early Cold War --- called Russians "a XVII
century semi-Asiatic people" who were "backwards" and
"servile]{.underline}." In 2018, [the Wall Street
Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-turn-to-its-asian-past-1530889247) similarly
characterized the crisis as "Russia's Turn to Its Asian Past."
The [contingency](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09670106211024408) of
"Slavs" as "White" was also [on
display](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/09/29/post-brexit-hate-crimes-against-poles-are-an-expression-of-long-standing-prejudices-and-contestation-over-white-identity-in-the-uk/) during [Brexit](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369183X.2018.1451308).

Afghanistan who has seen conflict rage for decades. This is a relatively

words carefully - city where you wouldn\'t expect that or hope that it
was going to happen.\"

T**[he narrative that only white people deserve peace and security is
all the more shameful because the global south suffers from war and
privation as a direct result of US/NATO actions.]{.underline}** **[It is
NATO that destroyed the nation of Libya, NATO which attempted to do the

US, French and British troops deployed across the continent. The white
world causes suffering and then says that the people of the global south
are "uncivilized" with no rights that need to be respected.]{.underline}

A Watson Institute of Brown
University [study](https://watson.brown.edu/research/2020/Post-9/11DisplacementStudy) showed
that [more than 37 million people in North Africa, Western and Central
Asia, and the Horn of Africa have been displaced by the US and its
allies since 2001.]{.underline} The humanitarian disasters begun years
ago are ongoing, as refugees use the Mediterranean and even the US
border with Mexico as points of escape. [After experiencing wars of
aggression these nations are then subjected to punishment as the United
States steals Afghanistan's assets and keeps Syria under the thumb of
Caesar Sanctions.]{.underline} These thefts cause more suffering and
even death as nations are robbed of the ability to care for their
people. Who is civilized and who is not?

[Ukraine has been pushed to the forefront of American thought in order
to defend the imperialist foreign policy which led to the current
conflict with Russia. If the blue eyed nation is suffering it is because
of US and NATO arrogance and aggression.]{.underline} Ukraine's current
situation is a direct result of the 2014 coup engineered by the US and
its EU partners. An elected president was dispatched and a civil war
began that has killed some 14,000 people. [Ukraine is a US colony with a
puppet government now under military attack.]{.underline} [Ukrainians
are themselves refugees as they flee to neighboring Poland, Romania,
Slovakia and other countries. It is the supposedly advanced, democratic,
and supposedly civilized who have created their problems.]{.underline}

[Yet once again bare faced racism is evident. African migrants and
students in Ukraine were prohibited from boarding trains and buses that
could take them to safety]{.underline}. A group of [Jamaican
students](https://twitter.com/JamaicaGleaner/status/1497947605254430725?s=20&t=j8--6150_hIDfaLzEOxNlQ) was
forced to walk 20 kilometers when they were forced off of a bus enroute
to Poland. Africans and Jamaicans live and study all over the world
because the US and Europe underdevelop their nations through a variety
of means. Yet Ukrainians and Poles didn't see people in need of help.
They determined that the non-blondes were not deserving of assistance.

Ironically[, it is the white supremacist underpinnings of US/NATO
foreign policy which has created all of Ukraine's suffering. The need to
dominate, to "contain" Russia and its ally China is not playing out the
way they had hoped but the Ukrainians be damned.]{.underline} The
MinskII agreement which was unanimously approved in the United Nations
Security Council was a roadmap to peace. [Ukraine should be a neutral
nation but that is the exact opposite of what its lords and masters in
Washington want. The good faith negotiations that could resolve the
crisis are a non-starter because NATO is a very dishonest
broker.]{.underline}

#### US Security cooperation with NATO and other European institutions sustains a Pan-European Project to uphold an axis of capitalist domination to suppress non-white culture in favor of 21^st^ century colonization 

**Doonan, 19**

\[David, "Confronting the U.S./EU/NATO Axis of Domination", Green Party

The intervention in Venezuela by the U.S. is an intervention in support
of white power."

How can this be explained? What lesson must the colonized in the global
South and the oppressed peoples and classes trapped in the nations of
the North take from this unity of purpose between the neocons and
liberal interventionists, the liberal bourgeoisie in the U.S. and Europe
and even the general public?

[The answer lies in the Eurocentric, white supremacist cultural
discourses that have conditioned the collective consciousness of
Westerners. **The cultural affliction of Eurocentric, white supremacist
ideology that has permeated all forms of cultural and ideological
expression**]{.underline}. It is not even a point of contention among
the academic and non-academic population, both left and right, that
["liberal" capitalist Europe represents a significant development in the
history of human civilizations, if not the apex of human
development.]{.underline}

This perspective, from Marxism that sees the [capitalist phase as a
necessary and inevitable stage (albeit with contradictions) to
neoliberal globalists, represents a "commonsense" position embedded in
all Western social institutions that simultaneously normalizes and
invisibilizes behavior informed by the assumptions of white privilege
and prerogatives.]{.underline}

["White supremacist cultural discourses have conditioned the collective
consciousness of Westerners."]{.underline}

Therefore, why shouldn't Trump and the Democrats intervene in Venezuela
to determine its leadership, especially when the racial element of that
action is apparently beyond comprehension?

For the public in the U.S., Gov. Northam and Donald Trump represent the
easy and crude examples of racism that is universally condemned[. But
the assumption that the white West has the right and responsibility to
determine the leadership and way of life of peoples in the global South
doesn't even register as a debatable issue within discourse on white
supremacy.]{.underline}

It is accepted as normal by the corporate media, most of the
intelligencia and the public that the U.S. and Europe, without any
authorization from any foundational source such as international law or
the United Nations Charter, has the right and indeed the responsibility
to police the world.

[The lack of debate on this issue and the cavalier attitude that most
have in the West to the real possibilities of yet another military
engagement with a global South nation that will likely result in the
deaths of thousands of human beings reaffirms once again that the value
of human life is stratified;]{.underline} the more distant that life is
from Europeans -- geographically, culturally and ethnically -- the less
value it has.

Consequently, [the people of the colonized global South fighting for
authentic de-colonization and national self-determination along with the
nationally oppressed peoples and classes in the North must be equally
clear. The European Union Parliament's decision to recognize the puppet
government being imposed on the people of Venezuela is another reminder
that there is a common enemy in the U.S./EU/NATO "axis of
domination."]{.underline}

**["The value of human life is stratified; the more distant that life is
from Europeans -- geographically, culturally and ethnically -- the less
value it has."]{.underline}**

The constituent elements of this contemporary [axis of domination was
established and is sustained as part of what the late Rod Bush referred
to as the Pan-European Project -- the white supremacist,
colonial/capitalist patriarchy -- that began with the invasion of the
"Americas" by Europe in 1492.]{.underline}

[That invasion provided the material basis for Europe moving from a
backwater region of no significance to the various world orders to the
predominant powers on the planet for the last 500 years.]{.underline}

It is important to understand, therefore, [that the critique of white
supremacy is not limited just to an idealization principle but has a
structural reality. This is what differentiates this analysis from the
simple rejection of racialism or white supremacy advanced by reform
liberals.]{.underline}

The analytical and theoretical framework employed here centers and
grounds the relationship between the institutions and [structures of
global white supremacy -- the IMF, World Bank, WTO, international
financial institutions and dollar hegemony, NATO -- and the ideological
expressions of white supremacy such as the belief in the cultural
superiority of Europe, ["humanitarian
interventions"](https://blackagendareport.com/content/humanitarian-intervention-human-rights-gift-keeps-giving-us-imperialism) and
the so-called [responsibility to
protect.](https://blackagendareport.com/content/syria-and-sham-)]{.underline}

Also in Middle East Eye, [Peter Oborne points
to](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/russia-ukraine-war-media-bias-west-blatant-racism) the
"blatant racism of the West" as it rushes to aid Ukraine against a
foreign invader, while failing to prioritise mercy missions to countries
such as Yemen, Gaza and Syria. In Al Jazeera, [Patrick
Gathara](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/3/1/covering-ukraine-a-mean-streak-of-racist-exceptionalism) highlights
[the "racist exceptionalism" on display amid the Russia-Ukraine war,
while a piece by [Andrew Mitrovica sarcastically
notes](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/3/8/some-lives-are-more-valuable-than-others) that
"some lives are more valuable than others - according to Western media's
coverage of the Ukraine war". ]{.underline}

The list goes on. People are disgusted and fed up with the baldfaced
vulgarity of pundits, reporters, editorial boards and politicians alike.
Articles calling attention to this hypocrisy receive thousands of likes
and retweets. But [should we really be so aghast to see European and
American journalists and politicians being who and what they are -
constitutionally racist to the bone?  ]{.underline}

Let me put it bluntly: I am not surprised to see that US and European
pundits and politicians are racist hypocrites. Of course they are. I am
just surprised by the reactions of critical thinkers of my own ranks and
convictions. Why are they surprised, aghast, plaintive? Why, in short,
are they disappointed? Did they expect differently, and if so, why?

Personally, I have never been surprised [to see images of
Israelis](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/world/middleeast/israelis-watch-bombs-drop-on-gaza-from-front-row-seats.html) picnicking
on a hill, drinking champagne or sipping cappuccino, as they watch their
army butcher Palestinians
in [Gaza](https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/gaza-under-attack). I
have always known that many do not even see Arabs as human beings.  

Has it not become abundantly clear by now that the idea of journalistic
objectivity, neutrality and fairness is a bad joke? When we write
articles pointing out such vulgar hypocrisies, to whom are we really
talking and trying to convince? What is the point of this repeated
preaching to the choir?  

European ideals

A whole generation of "postcolonial thinkers" from South Asia and Africa
have made their academic careers out of being disappointed at Europeans
for creating what they believe to be "universal" ideals and concepts,
and yet not applying them to people they have brutalised and conquered[.
Yet such principles and ideals were never universal. They were always
European, Christian, white supremacist, xenophobic,
homophobic, [antisemitic](https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/antisemitism) and [Islamophobic](https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/islamophobia).]{.underline}  

[Seeing other races and cultures as subhuman is written deeply into
celebrated European philosophies.]{.underline} Enlightenment
[thinker [Immanuel Kant once
wrote](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2019/2/28/blackface-white-mask-racism-as-psychosis) about
a Black carpenter: "It might be that there was something in this which
perhaps deserved to be considered; but in short, this fellow was very
black from head to foot, a clear proof that what he said was
stupid."]{.underline}

Indeed, many European philosophers thought non-Europeans were subhuman -
as do millions of Europeans and Americans who are philosophically
beholden to them. But my concern is not with them; it is with those who
seem so utterly disappointed that Europeans do not live by their own
standards. I believe they do.

[I don't think Americans and Europeans are being hypocritical about
Ukraine at all. In fact, they are being very consistent in their racist,
white supremacism. How many times and in how many places must we see
this before it finally sinks in?  ]{.underline}

**[We must stop thinking European "values" are universal. We must learn
and understand that they are exclusively European, and for Europeans
alone.   ]{.underline}**

That recognition does not compromise our ability to have a humane
reaction to ugly or uplifting realities around us. I [am severely
critical of the Russian thuggery in Ukraine, and I fully support
Ukrainians defending their homeland, as I do Afghans, Iraqis, Yemenis or
Palestinians]{.underline}**. [But this is not out of any false
assumption of the universality of European humanism.]{.underline} I** am
not partaking in western "values" when I express such reactions. I do so
strictly as a Shia Muslim and as an Iranian - and entirely based on my
own moral, political, cultural and civilisational convictions.  

[The very name "Europe" is an icon of racism and white supremacy. Yes,
there is a civilisation to that name, too; but as philosopher [Walter
Benjamin
said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/2004/05/16/walter-benjamins-brilliant/de7262db-4a2d-4540-a694-961f23e56347/):
"There is no document of civilisation which is not at the same time a
document of barbarism." **Europeans are the beneficiaries of their own
civilisation, and people around the globe are at the mercy of their
barbarism.**]{.underline}

in how **Western militaries** develop and acquire **technology** and
**weaponry**.]{.underline} It promotes moving away from a focus on the
mass production of high-end weapons to the development, rapid fielding,
and testing of prototypes in specific operational environments, 'where
units can fail early and fail small, to scale fast and learn fast'.11 As
formulated by the UK army as part of its own strategic conceptualisation
of prototype warfare, prototype warfare this way involves more than the
modification of existing acquisition processes.12 [It represents a
broader '**mindset'** or 'new approach' to military activity, which
'seeks to mimic the pace and intensity of wartime transformation by
prioritizing **experimentation** and **adaption**']{.underline} and
encourage warfighters 'to take calculated risks with a higher than
normal tolerance for failure, enabling them to learn, succeed and
exploit catalytic ideas that deliver asymmetric advantage'.13

Tracing recent conceptions of 'prototype warfare' across Western
military discourse and practice, my objective in this article is to map
the contours of a new regime of warfare, which is emerging against the
background of an overarching imperative of military innovation and
speculative understanding of the potential role of 'AI' in warfare.
[Broadly defined, [**regimes of warfare** are constellations of
**discourses**]{.mark}, practices, interactions, [**technologies**, and
**rationalities** that]{.mark} constitute and [organise war]{.mark} in a
specific and (largely) shared way.]{.underline} As argued by Antoine
Bousquet, historically, such shared ways of thinking about and
organising the conduct of war have strongly been informed by an
overarching scientific rationality.14 What Bousquet defines as 'the
scientific way of warfare' refers to this systematic and extensive
deployment of scientific ideas 'to inform thinking about the very nature
of combat and the forms of military organization best suited to prevail
in it'.15 As the regimes that Bousquet identifies are connected to the
prevalence of a specific set of scientific ideas and technologies in a
given period, this means that they are historically variable and always
subject to change.

My argument in this article is that [[**prototype warfare**
represents]{.mark} such [a]{.mark} shift and is reflective of a broader
transformation, or **[new regime of warfare]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Specifically, I argue that [the concept of prototype warfare captures
the emergence of a profoundly **experimental** way of **warfare**, which
is [driven by]{.mark} an overarching **[experimental
rationality]{.mark}**,]{.underline}16 and largely conducted
'by-experiment'.17 While warfare has always been underpinned by
experimental activity, what is particular in the current context is how
experimentation spans [across an increasingly wide range of military
practices, into the actual (or **simulated**) **battlefield**, and
across novel military-corporate **assemblages**.]{.underline} What
explains this spatialisation of experimental practice and its ubiquity
in contemporary warfare is a particular, highly speculative,
understanding of experimentation that is increasingly detached from a
more narrow interpretation of experimentation as a scientific practice
of replication and controlled testing and that embraces uncertainty and
failure as a productive force. As Michelle Murphy writes, [this kind of
[experimentation **legitimises**]{.mark} continued [**intervention** and
is]{.mark} largely **[self-perpetuating]{.mark}**, hailing 'life as
composed of composed of potential, of chances, of possibilities for
becoming, of manipulable relations that can be triggered and altered,
[if only the **right protocol**]{.mark} and **technique** [can be
**employed'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}18

As I will argue, this speculative understanding of experimentation in
the context of war has serious political implications. [Driven by this
kind of **experimental rationality**, the [experimental]{.mark} way of
[warfare is]{.mark} largely **[immune to failure]{.mark}**, or
uninterested in the **costs** or **aftermath** of the experiments being
deployed. [**Any result** represents **valuable data**]{.mark} gained,
and [so failures only serve to advance]{.mark} **further
[experimentation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This way, the experimental way
of warfare is largely insulated from critique, as militaries can always
point to lessons learned or to the future potential of the 'next'
experiment. As part of this development, [[**war** and **conflict**
become]{.mark} reconfigured mainly as [an opportunity to
**experiment**]{.mark}. Our wars become [**endless** and
**everywhere**]{.mark},]{.underline} not because of the (discursive
representation of) the enemy, but [[because]{.mark} of the broader
**[experimental infrastructure]{.mark}** that is created and that [needs
to be **maintained**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### L -- IR -- Anarchy

#### IR's [foundational assumptions]{.underline} of "anarchy" and "power" are [racist]{.underline}.

Anarchy and world politics: the tropical roots of IR theory

[[A **racist conceptualisation** of **anarchy** became the
**centerpiece** of]{.mark} the major paradigms of world politics:
**[realism]{.mark}** and **[liberalism]{.mark}**/idealism, [and]{.mark}
their recent offshoot, **[constructivism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Today,
realism is the dominant paradigm in world politics; or, specifically,
neorealism, which rests on Waltz's revision of the traditional realism
of Schuman and Morgenthau. Neorealism asserts that the international
system is anarchic and that states are the dominant actors. [The
anarchic structure of the system mandates a self-help orientation among
the states because]{.underline} without an authority above them,
[individual states must ensure their own security.]{.underline} In such
a system, security is the basic objective of states and power is
essential to achieving state aims and resisting those of others.
[[Realists argue]{.mark} that [states seek to maximise]{.mark} their
[power]{.mark} to ensure their security; [but, the **security dilemma**
ensures]{.mark} that, ironically, each state's [**pursuit** of]{.mark}
its own [**security** leads]{.mark} ultimately [to]{.mark} its
**[greater insecurity]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Balance of power practices
become essential in this conflict-laden global system in which power --
especially military power -- is the ultimate arbiter of conflicts of
interest. [**[Liberalism]{.mark}** (or idealism)]{.underline} -- [the
paradigmatic counterpoise of realism]{.underline} -- [[is similarly
grounded in]{.mark} a preoccupation with **[anarchy]{.mark}**. Idealists
accept the view that the **global system** is **anarchic**]{.underline}
and that anarchy could lead to security dilemmas, balance of power
politics, and interstate war, but unlike realists, they do not accept
that these are the inevitable outcomes of international interactions.
[Grounded in the **Enlightenment belief** in the **perfectibility** of
the **individual**, they transferred their view of domestic politics to
the international realm and argued that conflict and wars were largely a
result of "bad" institutions]{.underline} such as autocratic regimes,
and that by democratising regimes, facilitating international commerce,
and encouraging international institutions then international
cooperation would ensue. In this view, states are not destined to
predation borne of anarchy, the persistent pursuit of power and the
security dilemma, as realists maintain. Instead, the spread of
democracy, liberal international trade policies, and international law
would allow states to overcome the security dilemma and cooperate with
each other. Foreign policy is assumed to reflect domestic policy such
that states that are peaceful domestically (e.g. democracies) are more
likely to be peaceful abroad and those that are more violent
domestically (e.g. autocracies) are more likely to be violent abroad.

One of the key idealists of the twentieth century, who is also viewed as
one of the progenitors of the field of IR, was Woodrow Wilson (Ray 1995,
7). But the view that Wilson -- especially Wilson of the post-World War
I period -- established IR is more received wisdom than actual fact,
obfuscating less salutary but more significant factors leading to the
field's emergence. As noted above, at its birth, IR was concerned with
issues of anarchy and power; however, [[this **anarchy** was]{.mark}
largely [assumed to inhere in the]{.mark} "**[primitive]{.mark}**"
[**polities** of the]{.mark} "**[inferior]{.mark}**"
**[races]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [primarily in the **tropical**
domains of what we would now consider [the]{.mark} "**[third
world]{.mark}**". At the same time, the [relevant power was]{.mark} that
[wielded by the]{.mark} "**[civilised]{.mark}**" [**white** race
through]{.mark} their "**[modern]{.mark}**"
**[states]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The mechanism of "efficient" and
"rational" colonial administration, many early IR theorists maintained,
could ensure that "anarchy" did not spread to the "modern" world and
lead to violence among the major (white) powers. [So the
[concerns]{.mark} among realists and idealists [with **anarchy** are
grounded in a **racist discourse**]{.mark} that is [concerned with the
obligations]{.mark} of superior peoples [to **impose order** on the
**anarchic domains** of inferior peoples]{.mark} in order to prevent the
chaos presumed to be endemic in the latter]{.underline} from spilling
over into the former's territories or self-proclaimed spheres of
interest. Similarly, the realist and idealist concern with power was
grounded in a racist discourse concerned largely with the power of
whites to control the tropics, subjugate its people, steal its
resources, and superimpose themselves through colonial administration.
Therefore, [[the roots of **realism**]{.mark} -- the dominant paradigm
in world politics, [are grounded in a **rationalisation**]{.mark} for
the construction [of a **hierarchical racial order** to be **imposed**
upon the **anarchy**]{.mark} allegedly [arising from the]{.mark}
"[tropics]{.mark}", [which begs for]{.mark} rational **[colonial
administration]{.mark}** from whites.]{.underline} It is little more
than an intellectual justification for colonialism and imperialism in
the guise of the "white man's burden". Also, [[the roots of **idealism**
are found]{.mark} less [in]{.mark} idealised versions of classical
liberal precepts regarding the perfectibility of humanity, the primacy
of "God-given" individual rights, and the spread of democracy, free
trade, and the rule of law, than with [the **imposition** of a **white
racist order** on **indigenous peoples**]{.mark} throughout Africa,
Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.]{.underline}

Given the imperative for "progress" and "development" and the view that
the unspoiled lands were not being sufficiently exploited by the
indigenous peoples, realists and idealists agreed that the incentive for
imperialist conquest could lead to conflict among whites; therefore, a
rational distribution of territory and its appropriate administration by
colonial agencies was necessary. [[Realists and idealists]{.mark}
disagreed on the implications of the global system for the interaction
of white peoples and their states and political institutions,
but]{.underline} often they accepted or justified the subjugation of
non-whites by whites. In this way they [[found **congruence** in]{.mark}
their [**policy recommendations** for]{.mark} the domestic and
international spheres at least in this regard: they supported **[white
racial domination]{.mark}** through racial discrimination of non-white
minorities]{.underline} at home and white imperialism through racial
domination of non-white polities abroad. Nowhere were these racist
policies more evident than in Africa -- and in the treatment of the
racial minorities of the African diaspora in Western Europe and the
Americas.

While realism and idealism converge on a white supremacist logic that
has been evident since the establishment of the field of IR, I maintain
that [[this **racism**]{.mark} was not only present at the creation of
the field but [**continues** to inform]{.mark} the **[major
paradigms]{.mark}**, primarily -- though not uniquely --
[through]{.mark} their **[conceptions of anarchy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
For example, Sampson (2002, 429) argues that "the discourse of
international politics employs a particular conception of anarchy --
tropical anarchy -- that portrays the international system as
'primitive'". This "tropical anarchy", the social contract theorists
assumed, was the primeval condition of non-white peoples, which Kidd
(1898), among many others, rationalised as a basis for Western
colonialism. [The **anarchical world** -- the **state of nature** -- was
the preserve of non-Europeans, **primitive peoples**.]{.underline}
Sampson views anarchy as a "trope" more than a "natural state of
affairs"; but he is clear that, "while scholars may define anarchy
variously, the primitive images that anarchy evokes remain constant".
[[Not only are the **paradigmatic roots** of **IR theory** saturated
by]{.mark} the **[racist]{.mark}** stream of **[tropical
anarchy]{.mark}**, Sampson is even more explicit that "[the
**foundation** upon which]{.mark} much of [the **discipline** rests
is]{.mark} not anarchy but rather [an image of **primitive
society**]{.mark}]{.underline} popularised by British social
anthropologists during the 1930s and 1940s" (Sampson 2002, 429). For
example, Sampson argues that [Waltz's thesis on system structure derives
from [the **obsolete**, **anarchic**, and]{.mark} in many ways [**racist
conceptualisation** of African]{.mark} primitive [society]{.mark} of
anthropologist S. F. Nadel. Sampson]{.underline} (2002, 444) does not
argue that Waltz's definition of system structure -- so crucial to his
rendering of "structural realism --borrows from Nadel, "but the
structure Waltz employs is Nadel's" (emphasis in original). Waltz
analogises Nadel's view of the structure of African primitive societies
to the global structure in which international politics takes place. He
adds that Waltz "derived all three components of his theory of
international politics (ordering principles, functional differentiation,
and the distribution of material capabilities) form a theory of
primitive society published by Nadel in 1957" (Sampson 2002, 430); and
he documents Waltz's allusions to Nadel in his Theory of International
Politics as well as in prior and subsequent works.

### L -- IR -- Theory

#### The contemporary role of IR paradigms are built on white supremacist agendas to rationalize black primitivism through western saviorism while silencing discussions of embedded violence

**Hendersen, 15**

\[Errol. A, "Hidden in Plain Sight - Racism in International Relations
Theory", [Race and Racism in International Relations,]{.underline} It's
a Book, edited By University of Warwick, 2015, Routledge, accessed

Thus, it is not difficult to trace the historical and contemporary role
and impact of racism in IR theory[. Racism has not only informed the
paradigms of world politics, **it was fundamental to the
conceptualisation of its key theoretical touchstone:
anarchy.**]{.underline} [**The social contract theorists rooted their
conceptualisations of the state of nature in a broader "racial contract"
that dichotomised humanity racially and established a white supremacist
hierarchy in their foundational conceptions of society**.]{.underline}
[Late nineteenth and early twentieth-century IR theorists built on this
racist dualism as they constructed their conception of a global anarchy
and the role of "civilised" whites to provide, maintain, and ensure
order within it by a system of international power relations among
whites]{.underline} -- [or at minimum, dominated by whites, and a system
of colonial subjugation for non-whites -- or those nonwhites who failed
to successfully resist their domination militarily.]{.underline} The
impact and role of racism is manifest through the major paradigms
operative today [-- realism, neorealism, liberalism/idealism, and
constructivism]{.underline} -- [mainly through their continued reliance
on a racist conception of anarchy; in the case of neorealism through its
grounding in African primitivism, while for Marxism, its reliance on and
"normalising" of a Eurocentric teleology of economic development for the
world.]{.underline}

To be sure, [the dualism at the broad theoretical level of paradigms
underscores, guides, and informs the more specific dichotomies at the
level of theories, models, and theses that are derived from these
paradigms]{.underline} -- especially those that are applied to Africa's
political processes, and those of other regions as well. [In the case of
African international relations, they both contextualise and rationalise
a black African primitivism juxtaposed to a white Western
progressivism**, a black African peculiaristic savagery and a white
Western universalist humanity,** resulting in an enduring African
tribal/ethnic warfare frame of reference contrasted to an evolved
Western democratic peace;]{.underline} in each case a static ossified
ahistorical permanence contrasted to a dynamic evolving transcendence.
One result is that one must endure what are considered to be
"meaningful" or "appropriate" or even "incisive" or "cutting-edge"
discussions of Africa's domestic and international politics that have as
their point of departure loose and often obtuse references to "hearts of
darkness", "greed versus grievance", "tribal warfare", "warlordism",
"frontiersmen", or a litany of other metaphors that would not pass the
editor's desk at most top-tier academic journals as legitimate contexts
through which to observe and examine contemporary armed conflicts in the
Western world7. Notably, rarely do those same journals publish work on
the historical and enduring racism embedded in the major paradigms of
world politics or discuss the implications of such a condition if it
were shown to obtain.

[In fact, the "norm against noticing" white racism is so intense that it
engenders a "silencing" of those who would raise it; or it ensures
against publication in main- stream outlets for such work except that it
provides appropriate euphemisms for the atrocities associated with white
racism -- especially against blacks --]{.underline} or the requisite
"balance" to emphasise the role of non-whites in their own subjugation
-- **[as if white supremacism and the imperialism, colonialism,
neocolonialism and internal colonialism that it employed against
Africans, Asians, and Native Amer- icans are somehow the responsibility
of groups other than the whites who created it, maintained it, and
continue to profit from it]{.underline}**. Thus, the racist dualism in
world politics creates, in turn, a [dual quandary for IR scholars and
many Africanists seeking to publish in Western journals -- and many
non-Western ones, too -- wherein white racist expectations of the
appropriateness of certain lines of inquiry often limits the discourse
of African politics to hollow phraseology and meaningless
metaphors,]{.underline} **[while they simultaneously check informed
challenges to historical and contemporary expressions, practices, and
institutions of white racism in academia by ensuring that such racism is
rarely confronted in the major publications in IR/world politics in
clear and direct terms.]{.underline}**

### L -- IR -- Realism

#### The affirmative's realist conceptions of international relations perpetuate an anarchist pursuit of power grounded in notions of conquest and the rationalization of the white man's burden

[Through a systematic positing of **rationalism** and **parsimonious
models**, conventional **IR** elides the possibility of including the
lived **realities** of black, brown, and red peoples in the **Global
South** as valid forms of **evidence** and critical
perspectives.]{.underline} To the extent that these voices can be
quantified in an undifferentiated manner, they do not figure
legitimately into the existing disciplinary paradigm. [Without
intentionally **incorporating race** into the framework, scholars are
**unable to explain** phenomena such as the Global North's continued
**imperial domination** through globalization or the **racialized**
political economy of contemporary forms of **slavery**]{.underline} such
as sex-trafficking and forced domestic servitude in the United States
(Crawford 2002; Georgis and Lugosi 2014; J.A. Gordon 2019).
[**Alternative methodologies** that may allow for a more **ethical
incorporation** of race into **IR** include the world-travelling goal of
achieving 'a space of mutual understanding using the tool of
**empathy**,]{.underline} which is the ability to enter the spirit of a
different experience and find it in an echo of some part of oneself '
(Sylvester 2017, 182; see also Anzaldúa 1987; Sylvester 1995). [There is
also **poisie**, an **epistemological framework** for offering a
critique of and **reconstructing IR** in a fashion that is void of
colonial, capitalist-patriarchy]{.underline} (see Agathangelou and Ling
2004). Grovogui (2001) proposes reverse ethnography as a methodology
available to the formerly colonized for assessing the colonizers'
ontological dispositions for what they are and not what the colonizers
say they are. Exposing the limitations in this line of thinking in IR
knowledge production demonstrates the provincial nature of the
predominantly white approach to International Relations, which
contradicts the current positivist paradigm that calls for universal
theorizing. Finally, though not exclusively, [**ethics** demands
**connectedness** and its concomitant obligation to others. This
involves being in-relation-with-others instead of being separate.
**Models of IR** premised on **purity** would require the
**elimination** of relations with **others**]{.underline} (read as forms
of contamination), whereas those premised on being-in-relations leads to
a form of structural, ongoing mixture and transformation, which Jane
Anna Gordon (2014) describes as 'creolizing theory'. [As the **white
supremacist** origins of **IR** oppose such a model, overcoming that
history requires acknowledging a different **model of coexistence** on
our planet.]{.underline}

### L -- IR -- Constructivism

#### Constructivist understandings postulates that it is the burden of 'culturally evolved' western states to elevate primitive states from their lower condition - upholding a racist framework of the white democracy through neo-colonialism

**Hendersen, 15**

\[Errol. A, "Hidden in Plain Sight - Racism in International Relations
Theory", [Race and Racism in International Relations,]{.underline} It's
a Book, edited By University of Warwick, 2015, Routledge, accessed
6/24/22, GDS - LJ\]

For social constructivists the convergence with Waltz's system structure
is even more apparent. [The differentiation that Waltz fails to observe
in world politics is captured in Wendt's distinction between Hobbesian,
Lockean, and Kantian inter- national systems. Wendt views the essential
relationships among sovereigns in a Hobbesian anarchy as one of enemies,
while in a Lockean anarchy it is one of rivals, and lastly, in a Kantian
anarchy it is one of friends]{.underline}. His most culturally evolved
system, the Kantian, is one shared primarily by the Western powers,
while others exist within Lockean and Hobbesian contexts. **[This meant
that only the Western states could be entrusted to transfer to the third
world the requisites for a higher level of social evolution to elevate
them out of their lower condition.6 Therefore, "the 'burden" of
structural transformation, the responsibility of 'teaching' the rest of
the world how to evolve, falls squarely on the shoulders of great
powers. Less powerful states have little or no hope of transforming the
international system on their own]{.underline}**" (Waltz 1979, 449).
Sampson characterises Wendt's "social theory of international relations"
as "remarkably un-international". He states that while Wendt chastises
Waltz's study for lacking a reference to "role" in its index, Sampson
counters that "discounting Montezuma and the Aztecs, one might say the
same of Wendt's social theory for the entire 'Third World'" (Sampson
2002, 448--9). He adds that

Wendt's text is largely an attempt to explain how [Europe and the United
States pulled themselves out of 'nature's realm'. It tells us how NATO
and Europe evolved into complex social kinds through a process dubbed
'cultural selection'. There is no mention of non-Western social kinds.
It is not even clear whether African or Asian states could 'evolve'
without the help of bigger, more powerful benefactors.]{.underline}

(Sampson 2002, 449)

Sampson notes that counter to the title of Wendt's most popular article,
"anarchy is only what some states make of it". [In fact it is as
constrained by the logic of tropical anarchy as is Waltz's; only that
where Waltz rationalises the stasis of the status quo equilibrium (i.e.
the balance of power, or, by analogy, the maintenance of Western power
in the colonies), Wendt rationalises the transformation of the status
quo within limits governed by the status quo powers (i.e. Kantian social
evolution, or, by analogy, the establishment of colonial administration
in the colonies as a function of the "white man's burden" or mission
civilatrice)]{.underline}. He concludes that, by arguing that 'anarchy
is what states make of it'**[, Wendt suggests that powerful, civilised
states have the capacity to lift weaker, primitive states out of the
heart of darkness and into the light of democratic peace. Thus super-
powers like the United States should shoulder the global burden of
civilising international society.]{.underline}** This reverses Waltz's
conclusions. Waltz seeks system maintenance and equilibrium. Wendt seeks
transformation. Waltz privileges power over progress. Wendt suggests the
opposite.

(Sampson 2002, 450)

Waltz's framework resurrects anthropology's misrepresentation of African
political systems of the 1950s and Wendt reproduces anthropological
debates of the 1930s and 1940s (Sampson 2002, 451). Both paradigms
converge on a notion of tropical anarchy, which reinforces a racist
dualism in world politics that is manifest, in turn, in prominent theses
that derive from these paradigms.

Applying a Decolonial Lens to Security Studies

Decolonial theory has gained traction in the humanities and is slowly
entering the social sciences, including IR theory (Chakrabarty 2000;
Jones 2006; Mignolo 2012; Rao 2013; Capan 2017; Weiner 2018). The very
language of decolonization suggests a more substantive critique of
dynamics of inclusion and exclusion and how they operate in the study of
global security. Indeed, postcolonial and [**decolonial** approaches to
**IR** form a type of "deep **theorizing**" that exists on a par with
**realism** or **liberalism**]{.underline} (Berenskoetter 2018). [A
decolonial lens on the field begins with the observation that entrenched
and deeply rooted social and political **hierarchies** based on
**exclusionary practices** shape both **geopolitics** and the
**production of knowledge**, with particular attention to global
hierarchies of **race**, as well as **imperial** and **colonial
histories**]{.underline} (including settler colonialism in North America
and elsewhere). These hierarchies have both shaped and coexist with the
formal structures of international relations (such as states,
international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations) and
constitute an additional layer of power relations and forms of exclusion
that often remain invisible in mainstream approaches to security.

[For example, the **erasure of race** from **IR** occurred in the
post-1945 period when there was a switch from a study of **global race
relations**, colonialism, empire, and "civilizations," to a focus on
"**states**"]{.underline} (Vitalis 2015). [What W.E.B. Du
Bois]{.underline} (1903) [referred to as the "**global color line**"
**disappeared** as an object of analysis in IR,]{.underline} with race
being almost invisible as a salient factor in security studies (Doty
1993; Jones 2008; Nisancioglu 2019). A more trenchant critique would
argue that security studies suffers from the problem of "methodological
whiteness" (Bhambra 2017). This means that, not only is race made
invisible, but also the security effects of race---such as racialized
violence and the legacies of colonial histories---are not defined as
"security issues" (Howell and Richter-Montpetit 2019). [With few
exceptions, **IR** and security scholars have not engaged with global
issues of **policing**, **criminal justice**, **incarceration**, or
movements such as **B**lack **L**ives **M**atter.]{.underline}2 A focus
on the state and the attachment to nationalism as a primary identity
(see also Hendrix, this issue) draws attention away from other
cross-cutting identities and solidarities, such as transnational
solidarity movements based on race or religion, including movements such
as black internationalism (Daulatzai 2012; Munro 2017; Blain 2018).

In addition to the erasure of race, [contemporary security studies has
focused more on the projection of power by **powerful actors** than its
effects on the **less powerful**.]{.underline} Security studies is still
a US-dominated discipline, and decision-making in Washington DC is its
primary reference point. [English language journals are filled with
**policy-relevant** articles geared to the **maximization** of **US
power**, not how other states and non-state actors can best contain or
resist US power]{.underline} (Adamson 2016, 21). Classic security
studies' case studies, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, are seen
through the lens of actors in Washington rather than Washington\'s
adversaries or targets (Laffey and Weldes 2008). Topics such as
humanitarian intervention are approached more often from the
intervener\'s perspective than that of those in the state targeted for
intervention (Sabaratnam 2017). [Security studies has largely
**marginalized** perspectives on world events that derive from a
**Global South** position]{.underline} (Barkawi and Laffey 2006; Acharya
2014). For example, studies of World War II regularly ignore their
racial and colonial dimensions, including the roles played by black
troops in the United States and colonial troops in Britain (Krebs 2006;
Barkawi 2016, 2017). Security studies scholarship on the global war on
terrorism has focused more on strategies that policymakers could take to
prevent terrorism than the impact of those strategies on vulnerable
communities or the experiences of those caught up in the global
counterterrorism infrastructure (Khalili 2013).

### Alt -- Radical IR

#### The alternative is [radical IR -- a method of pessimism that allows us to create an alternative]{.underline}

Studies Review, accessed 6/27/2022,

a perm card

This article set out to accomplish three things. First, [it has
demonstrated that the field of IR theory has largely neglected the
potential contributions of radicalism as a way of orienting some of our
theoretical practices. This is as much a critique of mainstream IR
theory with its status-quo orientation as well as a critique of critical
IR. Second, I have drawn a sketch of what a radical IR would look like
in terms of its focus, its positionality in relation to political
action, and a rethinking of critical methods---moving from a method of
critical genealogy to a method of destruction. Third, the article has
shown **the promises and virtues of a radical IR** by briefly discussing
the debates about liberal world order and showing the possible
interventions of radicalism in IR\'s engagement with such
debates]{.underline}.\
[While the method]{.underline} of a radical IR [asks us for
pessimism]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} an amount of ["destructive
suspicion,"]{.underline} a turn to [radical IR should not force us to
abandon hope and affirmative attempts to reimagine world
politics]{.underline}. [The dual importance of "uprooting" old
conceptions and the "rooting" of new imaginings of world politics should
remain at the forefront of any turn to radicalism]{.underline}. **[It is
precisely because alternatives are possible that pessimism is
possible]{.underline}**. As David Chandler (2019, 188) writes of
affirmation and the Anthropocene: "If no alternatives are possible, even
in the imagination, then pessimism is no longer possible." In short,
[radicalism should bring us hope and represent an affirmative
alternative to the contemporary world order]{.underline}.\
What a **[radical IR]{.underline}** asks for above all else **[is a
revolution in thinking]{.underline}**: in a restructuring of scholars'
relationship with our subject matter and our methods. Would we be
willing to call anything less than that "radical?"

### Alt -- Reactionary Internationalism

#### The alternative is to analyze [reactionary international politics]{.underline} 

By Joseph **MacKay and** Christopher David **LaRoche, 2018** ("Why Is
There No Reactionary International Theory?", International Studies
Quarterly, accessed 6/26/2022, <https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqx083>)
//lrap

[Reaction]{.underline}, we have argued, [is almost completely absent
from contemporary international-relations theory]{.underline}. However,
we can find fragmentary traces of reaction in the field\'s history and
an extensive presence in the history of political thought. [Reactionary
beliefs and dispositions play a significant role in modern international
political practice]{.underline}. This raises the question: why is there
now no reactionary international theory? Here, we can only offer some
conjectures. We suspect that its absence is linked to the field\'s
putatively ameliorative orientation---that is, the way the field often
locates its roots in liberal idealism and the decidedly nonreactionary
challenge posed by realists. Such a narrative, and particularly the part
played by liberalism, suggests notions of "the good" in world politics
incompatible with reactionary ideas.58\
This narrative renders [past international-relations reactionaries
invisible by obscuring connections between canonical
international-relations schools and reactionary ideas]{.underline}.
Early realists are read as emphasizing the permanent limits of political
change. Early geopolitical reactionaries have, until recently, been read
out of the discipline entirely. Liberal linkages to empire were elided
as embarrassing. Later critical theorists rejected liberals and realists
alike as unreflexive and presentist---as too focused on the status quo
and blind to the possibilities of emancipatory politics. However, they
did so in the name of "a critique of domination" that would explore
means of resistance available to "those systematically or casually
subjected to sustained forms of suffering, denigration, and/or
exclusion" (Weber 2014, 532).59 Such criticisms may reject reaction
generally but do little to distinguish it from the joint liberal-realist
project of international-relations theory as such.\
Why then does reaction matter? [The practice of reactionary
international politics appears more widespread at present than at any
time in the post-war period]{.underline}. At the time of writing,
[far-right parties are active---though not quite ascendant---across
Europe]{.underline}; [the politics of reaction appears increasingly
normalized]{.underline} (Cole 2005; Fligstein, Polyakova, and Sandholtz
2012). British voters, led by activists chiefly from the right, narrowly
chose to leave the European Union. This "[Brexit]{.underline}" was
partially motivated by "cultural backlash" (Inglehart and Norris 2016,
29--31) or racially tinged (Rajan-Rankin 2017, 2) nostalgia. The stated
positions of the new American president, who campaigned on a promise to
"Make America Great Again," often upend the traditional party system and
deride liberal international order (Patrick 2017). The so-called Islamic
State has declared a Caliphate, putatively modeled on a premodern
Islamic world order (Ahmad 2017, 12). Elsewhere in the West, [individual
reactionary radicals]{.underline} like Kaczynski and Breivik [no longer
seem isolated]{.underline}, as [evidenced by the rise of the alt-right
and its self-styled ideologues]{.underline}, such as Richard Spencer
(Wood 2017). Once-solid [bulwarks between the mainstream right and
extremists no longer seem secure]{.underline}.60 [Reactionary politics
are on the march and are reshaping the world political future. However
concerning this may be, though, the account above reminds us these
circumstances are not new: reaction is a recurring feature of
international politics]{.underline}.61\
If we are correct, then [the contemporary discipline, scrupulously
forgetful of its reactionary past, is shorn of intellectual history that
might clarify present circumstances]{.underline}. [A field that ignores
reaction as such may be blind to reactionary political practice. This
blindness in turn weakens the responses scholars can offer]{.underline}.
Indeed, contemporary reaction might have been anticipated. A quarter
century ago, in framing his otherwise ultra-liberal "end of history"
thesis, Francis Fukuyama noted a powerful nostalgia for the time when
history existed:\
Such nostalgia, in fact, will continue to fuel competition and conflict
even in the post-historical world for some time to come. Even though I
recognize its inevitability, I have the most ambivalent feelings for the
civilization that has been created in Europe since 1945, with its north
Atlantic and Asian offshoots. Perhaps this very prospect of centuries of
boredom at the end of history will serve to get history started once
again. (Fukuyama 1989, 18)\
That nostalgia now appears present in force in world politics.62 In the
years ahead, a central task for international-relations theory will be
to take reaction seriously, as both an intellectual tradition and a form
of practical politics. Scholars whose political preferences are liberal
or radical, or who embrace a realist skepticism of both projects, may
find little to dislike in their field\'s implicit antireactionary moral
orientation. [**We do not advocate a reactionary alternative. We aim
instead to consider the analytical and political implications of having
neglected reaction as such**. A field that does not understand it in
theory is ill equipped to understand and confront it in
practice]{.underline}.

### Alt -- Transnational Black Geographies

#### The alternative is to endorse a Transnational Black Geography that refuses to endorse cooperation with NATO -- the aff participates in an anti-black regime of bordering that operates to fracture liberatory coalitions and maintain your complicity in White Supremacy

**Carastathis 22** -- political theorist and co-director of the Feminist
Autonomous Centre, PhD in Philosophy at McGill University \[Anna, "So
many bordered gazes: Black Mediterranean geographies of/against
anti-Black representations in/by Fortress Europe," 5/19/2022 first

[When it becomes difficult to]{.underline} state the obvious, to [name
violence,]{.underline} to see what is right in front of our eyes --
despite attempts to keep it from view, to get us to avert our gaze --
[when every]{.underline} utterance, every [representation circulates in
an economy structured by censorship, this is a crisis of representation.
But who is this "we" who has an obligation to watch what has
systematically been hidden from view? What is crucial is that this "we"
is not a naturalised collectivity already given to us by state
power.]{.underline} Thus, **[how we constitute this "we"]{.underline}**,
which Ariella Azoulay has termed the "citizenry of photography"
(Azoulay, 2008), **[is a political question]{.underline}** converging
with that with which Hawthorne concludes her lecture. [How do we resist
the totalisation of representations in times of crisis against and
beyond the bordering of our subjectivities by states and capital? **This
collective subject, who has the responsibility to watch**]{.underline}
(Azoulay, 2008) **[and listen]{.underline}** to photographs (Campt,
2017) **[is,]{.underline}** perhaps, the collective subject Hawthorne
evokes at the end of her lecture: **[created out of "shared political
visions, intertwined histories of struggles and resistance, and
nonlinear diasporic entanglements", seeking to "disrupt state systems of
categorisation"]{.underline}** (Hawthorne, 2021). The "citizenry of
photography", as I understand it, is crosscut by and seeks to refuse the
violence of national citizenship, as well as its privileges.
**[Some]{.underline}** of us **[experience this racist, gendered border
violence directly, on our bodies; others, benefiting from privileges of
racialised citizenship, move through borders]{.underline}** (and in
bordered societies) **[with ease and do not experience their
violence.]{.underline}** All of us are viewing (when we should be
watching) photographs: alone, together. Azoulay (2008) makes a
distinction between looking at and watching photographs, noting,
"\[p\]hotographs don\'t speak for themselves. Alone, they do not
decipher a thing. Identifying what is seen doesn\'t excuse the spectator
from "watching" the photograph, rather than looking at it, and from
caring for its sense" (Azoulay, 2008:25). **[Rather than looking at
photographs through the ossifying gazes we inherit and reproduce, we
must disrupt normative frames of meaning by taking responsibility for
the ongoing injustices they represent.]{.underline}**

Anti-Blackness suffuses the normative gazes that states attempt to
naturalise through their control of borders, including the borders that
structure vision. Globally and in European societies in particular,
**[anti-Blackness is a deep structure of racial capitalism, which is
institutionalised]{.underline}** in migration policies **[and fully
internalised in ordinary perception.]{.underline}** Dionne Brand has
powerfully articulated how the abduction and forced migration of
enslaved Africans through the Door of No Return in transatlantic slavery
"transformed us into bodies emptied of being, bodies emptied of
self-interpretation, into which new interpretations could be placed"
(Brand, 2001:93). What is crucial, both for acts of perceiving
representations and for acts of collectively generating representations
-- in social movements against borders, in a fundamentally anti-Black
world -- is that we neither reproduce the divisions border regimes
depend upon (including the racial categories of white supremacy) nor
fallaciously pretend these divisions are not material or real. Both are
representational risks with which no-border movements tarry, as they
seek to effect coalitions and relations of horizontal solidarity among
people whom the nation-state system, racial capitalism, and
heteropatriarchy consign to differential fates. What does this mean for
no-border movements? I believe it underscores the importance of
interrogating racism and sexism and homophobia and transphobia -- and,
more generally, a taken-for-granted heteronormativity universalising the
colonial/modern binary gender system -- as these articulate capital and
state power. Moreover, no-border movements have the potential to
constitute a "we" that, in its utopian moments, prefigures collective
liberation and, in its pragmatic moments, confronts the epistemic
oppression that "speaking for" people on the move entails. To quote the
Black Mediterranean Collective\'s crucial insight: "This ontology of
\`spoken for\' subjects reproduces a strong, forensic epistemology that
simultaneously displaces the point of view of the living, and replaces
the memorialisation of the death" (BMC, 2021:12).

[Struggles against borders]{.underline} in the European context often
[trace their lineages to anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, anarchist, and
anti-authoritarian movements but less often to anti-colonial and
anti-racist movements]{.underline}. In this connection, it feels
important to point out that the "**[neo-fascism]{.underline}** in
contemporary Mediterranean migration politics" (BMC, 2021:11) **[has
many guises across]{.underline}** what is conventionally understood as
**[the political spectrum; like white supremacy and heteropatriarchal
ideologies, it is not exclusively the currency of self-declared
fascists, the extreme right, ethnonationalists, or
neo-Nazis.]{.underline}** Perhaps white European citizens can less
easily recognise fascism in the technocratic discourses of neoliberal
Europe than in the explicitly racist, anti-Black, anti-Muslim,
anti-Roma, and anti-Semitic (and simultaneously homophobic, transphobic,
and misogynistic) discourses of "sovereign \`strongmen\' who have arisen
in this epoch of crisis capitalism" (BMC, 2021:11). **[For all its
hand-wringing and expressions of "concern" for the rise of
"illiberal",]{.underline}** "draconian", and "authoritarian"
**[politics]{.underline}** within Europe, **[the EU funds and
orchestrates a]{.underline}** veritable **[race war at the
borders]{.underline}** of Europe, **[together with a range
of]{.underline}** national **[governments which avow]{.underline}**
various political allegiances and orientations, including **[commitments
to liberal democracy]{.underline}** (which are incompatible with
conventional understandings of "fascism").

**[Whilst people on the move are violently attacked, tortured, and
killed,]{.underline}** migration **[scholars seem to have difficulty
naming this a race war.]{.underline}** The EU has constituted a
dedicated military force charged with overseeing and coordinating
national militaries, coastguards, and border police in their bordering
projects, namely Frontex, which seeks over the next 5 years to increase
nearly 10-fold the number of people it employs (from 1400 currently, in
2022, to 10 000 by 2027). **[Civil society]{.underline}**
search-and-rescue **[operations, human rights monitoring]{.underline}**,
and investigative journalists in the Mediterranean report on the violent
collusion between national coastguards and border
**[police]{.underline}** (on all sides of the sea and land borders),
Frontex, **[and NATO,]{.underline}** as well as paramilitary border
hunters. Yet this violence **[is]{.underline}** still overwhelmingly
**[understood as an exception to the "rule of law".]{.underline}** The
massive encampment and incarceration projects based on racialised
citizenship are naturalised in research decrying "reception conditions"
but not the very existence of camps, detention centres, and borders
themselves. Migration scholars tend to reproduce the
self-representations of EU and other European democracies, even as they
critique aspects of the migration regime. For instance, the dubious
division between so-called "economic migrants" and "refugees",
ascriptions of "vulnerability", or carceral discourses around
"trafficking" are uncritically reproduced as racialised/gendered
background assumptions even in critical migration studies. For instance,
what goes unquestioned in studies of migration management
infrastructure, such as the hotspot mechanism instituted in Italy and
Greece in 2016, is that asylum processes have the goal of offering
"protection", rather than expediting deportation on newly proliferating
grounds. These notions, lifted from EU policy documents in myriad
studies, lend academic legitimacy to the manufactured hellscape of
hotspots, such as the infamous Moria camp (and its successor Moria 2.0,
on the firing range at Kara Tepe) on Lesvos. An analysis of anti-Black
racism and coloniality in European migration studies would allow
reflection on the anti-Blackness and coloniality not only of migration
regimes but, also, of the axioms of migration studies itself. As the
Black Mediterranean Collective argues, the field lacks "a systematic
analysis of racism and anti-Blackness as integral to the dynamics of
trans-Mediterranean migration, exclusion, and differential
incorporation" (BMC, 2021:15).

Contemporary anti-Black racism has been formed by processes of long
historical duration that are defined by and define mobility and place.
Thus, the aim, as I understand it, of [Black Mediterranean
Geographies]{.underline} in the current [conjuncture is not simply to
intersect "Blackness" with "people on the move" or to recognise or
acknowledge that institutionalised hostility and border violence against
people on the move draws on repertoires of anti-Black racism. **The
theoretical paradigm**]{.underline} that Hawthorne proposes in her
lecture **[goes deeper to challenge how anti-Blackness suffuses
foundational categories of thought: body, space, and
race.]{.underline}** In their introduction to their germinal edited
collection, Black Geographies and the Politics of Place, Katherine
McKittrick and Clyde Woods identify three dilemmas in thinking about
space and race that constitute what they term "bio-geographic
determinism", a way of thinking or imagining that makes Black
geographies unknowable: first, geographic determinism, the construction
of "black bodies inherently occupying black spaces"; second, the
reduction of Black geographies to flesh, "the body as the only relevant
black geographic scale"; and third, the abstraction or de-mattering of
Black geographies to devices of imagination, "metaphoric/creative
spaces, which are not represented as concrete, everyday, or lived"
(McKittrick and Woods, 2007:7). The consequence of these habits of
thought wrought by white supremacy is that "race, or blackness, is not
understood as socially produced and shifting but is instead
conceptualised as transhistorical, essentially corporeal, or allegorical
or symbolic" (McKittrick and Woods, 2007:7). By what violent conceptual
and perceptual acts, then, does Blackness get equated with the
particular and with "nuance" (Harris, 1990) whilst simultaneously being
constructed as fungible (Spillers, 2003; Hartman, 1997) -- mired in
place and yet perpetually out of place (Mohanram, 1999) -- whilst
whiteness is constructed, simultaneously, as universal, mobile, and yet
an exclusive property, defined by the right to exclude (Harris, 1993)?

Hawthorne\'s lecture points to a much-needed critique of migration
studies as reproducing anti-Black racism through its failure to confront
anti-Black racism at the heart of the global regime of borders but,
also, in extractivist migration circuits of "differential inclusion"
(Sharma, 2006), such as the exploitation of African agricultural workers
to harvest Italian tomatoes, some of which are exported to their
countries of origin, like Ghana (Auvellain and Liberti, 2014). Hawthorne
points out that although "the majority of the people arriving to Italy
via the central Mediterranean route were Black immigrants from
sub-Saharan Africa (and, in many cases, with direct (post)colonial ties
to Italy)", anti-Black racism has not figured in European migration
studies and public discourses as "an essential part of the story" of the
so-called refugee crisis post-2015 (Hawthorne, 2021). At the same time,
Hawthorne notes that "there was often an unsettling tendency to
uncritically impose the geographies of the Middle Passage upon what was
happening in the Mediterranean" (Hawthorne, 2021), for instance by
"juxtapos\[ing\] the famous diagram of the slave ship Brookes ... with
aerial shots of migrant boats in the vast blue of the Mediterranean.
What work do these visual comparisons do, and what analyses do they
elide?" (Hawthorne, 2021). As someone who was urged by an editor to make
this comparison in an article on photographic representations of the
refugee crisis, I appreciate Hawthorne\'s urging us to think about the
limitation of "visual comparisons". I am not sure if "comparison" best
describes the intentional act of perception of a representation (an act
of looking that is sedimented by relations of power), which itself
reproduces other representations. What I mean is that the relationship
between a photograph and a woodcut print from the eighteenth century has
already been forged in and through the visual economies of
anti-Blackness before any comparative claim between the two is made.
What is significant here is that both the photograph and the woodcut,
though using dehumanising strategies of representation, become the
visual anchor for calls, respectively, for the abolition of slavery and
for open borders. The pamphlet Description of a Slave Ship, published in
1789 by the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade,
included a print of "Plan of an African Ship\'s Lower Deck with Negroes
in the Proportion of Only One to a Ton", which was "the most famous,
widely-reproduced, and widely-adapted image representing slave
conditions on the middle passage ever made" (Wood, 1997:212; see SEAST,
1789). The photograph I believe Hawthorne is referring to in her lecture
is entitled "Rescue Operation", taken by Massimo Sestini from a
helicopter, which reproduces the framing, point of view, and arguably
the cultural agenda of anti-slavery visuals, arguably illustrating
Marcus Wood\'s "central premise ... that the task of explaining why the
middle passage was represented the way it was bears not only on the past
but also on the present" (Wood, 1997:212). Sestini\'s "Rescue Operation"
depicts people on the move, predominantly Black people, on a boat 25 km
from the Libyan coast, prior to being intercepted by an Italian navy
ship in Operation Mare Nostrum in 2014 (see World Press Photo, 2015).
This photograph was shot from a helicopter, locating the spectator above
the subjects of the photograph. This point of view reproduces and
normalises a military perception of humans as "targets", whether of guns
or cameras. It puts the viewer of the photograph -- presumptively the
citizen -- in the position of authority, surveilling the seas, whilst
locating the subjects of the photograph in a subordinate position,
subject to state control, surveillance, visibility, or extinguishment.
The refugees in the crowded boat photographed by Sestini were identified
through Operation Mare Nostrum (OMN), a military--humanitarian operation
of the Italian government, which deployed sea vessels, helicopters, and
aircraft to monitor and control "migration flows" in the Mediterranean
Sea in the aftermath of the Lampedusa shipwrecks. OMN was replaced by
Frontex\'s Operation Triton in 2014 and Eurosur -- the EU\'s sea and
land surveillance system using drones. What perhaps echoes in
"comparative" viewing of the two images (encouraged by the framing of
the photograph by the photographer) is the objectification of the people
rendered as anonymous bodies, as Wood argues, "an abolitionist cultural
agenda which dictated that slaves were to be visualised in a manner that
emphasised their total passivity and their status as helpless victims"
(Wood, 1997:212). The comparison between these two images, then, as
inopportune and problematic as it may be for myriad other reasons, tells
us something about how people on the move -- in particular when they are
Black Africans -- are objectified by the various racialised gazes to
which they are subject: the military--humanitarian gaze, the gaze of
photographers, and the gaze of "empathetic" or "hostile" viewers of
photographs of the refugee crisis, all of which embody white supremacy.

Hawthorne points out the limitations in attempts to make sense of the
Mediterranean refugee crisis as a sedimentation of histories of
anti-Black racism focussed on geographies of the Middle Passage and
plantation slavery whilst being equally critical of the "geographical
sleight of hand" through which "slavery \[is constructed as\] something
that happened \`out there\' in the Americas" (Hawthorne, 2021). White
European efforts abound to airbrush slavery from the history of European
empires, both in their colonies and in their metropoles, to excise from
the historical record their participation in slavery and plunder.
Indeed, these ahistorical and ageographic disavowals bolster a
"post-racial" (Boulila, 2020) or "non-racist" view of contemporary
European societies (Lentin, 2018), by locating racism "elsewhere" in
time and place. Hawthorne critiques analytic moves to superimpose the
Black Atlantic on the Black Mediterranean. She surveys influential Black
feminist theories which demonstrate how the plantation and the Middle
Passage have been key to producing "modern ontological systems of
categorisation and hierarchisation that continue to determine value and
access to full \`humanness\'" (Hawthorne, 2021) and the "ungendering of
Black flesh" (Hawthorne:9). At the same time, Hawthorne offers a nuanced
critique of comparative approaches that elide the specificity of the
historical emergence of the Black Mediterranean by assuming that
analyses in Black studies developed of the "plantation-based racial
chattel slavery" and its afterlives "can be stretched" to other
geographies, such as those that materialised in Africa or Europe or
between Africa and Europe. The Black Mediterranean cannot function
either as the prehistory to European conquest, transatlantic slavery,
and the Black Atlantic or as the contemporary analogue of these
historically and geographically determinate processes.

I want to argue that we can no longer approach the Black Mediterranean
as a (now defunct) precondition for a racial capitalist order centred on
the North Atlantic. Nor is it sufficient to approach the dynamics of the
contemporary Mediterranean as merely derivative of Black Atlantic
afterlives of slavery. Instead, [it is urgent to study the ongoing
reproductions of the Black Mediterranean in the present, along with all
of its ongoing, nonlinear articulations with the Black Atlantic
(]{.underline}as well as the Black Pacific and the Black Indian Ocean).

(Hawthorne, 2021)

In this connection, Hawthorne poses some crucial questions about how
[plantation slavery may be conceptualised transnationally, neither
"reducing its relevance to a matter of bio-genealogical kinship
\[n\]or ... rendering it little more than a vague metaphor for
anti-Blackness in general]{.underline}" (Hawthorne, 2021). This is
connected to Hawthorne\'s deeper, germane critique of provincialising
versus universalising moves in Black geographic scholarship and in
vernacular geographies of anti-Black racism. She observes that "the
field of Black Studies is more institutionally established in the United
States than it is in Europe, which has shaped the economies of knowledge
production about the Black diaspora that some Black European scholars
have come to controversially term "African American hegemony"
(Hawthorne, 2021). (Incidentally, similar claims are made by European
scholars about African American feminists\' "hegemony" in
intersectionality studies. The ascription of "hegemony" to scholars who
are internally colonised within North American white settler states and
marginalised within Anglo-American academies is, to put it mildly,
jarring in both instances.) Whilst rejecting diffusionism, Hawthorne\'s
lecture prompts deeper reflection on how ideas and activist practices
circulate, "touch down" (Browne and Nash, 2019--2020), and get taken up
across geographies.

In this connection, her discussion of **[the transnational Black Lives
Matter movement is illuminating. Suggesting "we shift our focus to
understand Black Lives Matter itself as a diasporic resource that is
shared back and forth across different diasporic sites -- and
specifically, in this case, across the Black Atlantic and the Black
Mediterranean",]{.underline}** Hawthorne seeks to displace framings of
"Black Lives Matter going global", which have the tendency to "elide the
work Black Italian organisers had been undertaking for over a decade --
movement work that sometimes, but not always, was explicitly connected
to Black American mobilisations" (Hawthorne, 2021). Especially in light
of the European Parliament\'s resolution that "Black Lives Matter" in
2020, whereby parliamentarians denounced racism and discrimination,
no-border activists retorted to nonperformative (Ahmed, 2006) European
institutional and corporate statements that "Black Lives Matter also in
the Med". In light of this, I would question Hawthorne\'s empirical
claim that "\[t\]he language of abolition has not yet been taken up as a
framework for action in these Black Lives Matter mobilizations" (2020).
Calls for the abolition of Frontex, which Hawthorne cites as evidence of
an emergent abolitionist consciousness (Hawthorne, 2021), continue
decades-long anti-detention and anti-prison struggles in the context of
border abolitionist (no-border) movements. The broader point, however,
is that through such comparisons (which, elsewhere in her article, she
rejects), little space is left for an explicitly internationalist
orientation in abolition struggles, which rejects the bordering of
social movement imaginaries to nationalised geographies. [This is not
just a question of "borrowing" or "circulating" terms and concepts but
rather of forming internationalist coalitions of struggle against the
normative bordering of the world and of our communities of concern.
Internationalism discerns both the specificities of local struggle --
often waged by diasporic communities -- and their interconnection
against globalised regimes of rule.]{.underline}

**[Continents are racial concepts. Through logics of anti-Blackness
embodied in colonial processes of long duration, the Mediterranean is
rendered representationally non-Black in the European imaginary and
materially anti-Black in European migration politics.]{.underline}**
What is suppressed by European anti-Blackness is that Mediterranean
geographies are, and have always been, "multiracial", not in virtue of
recent, postcolonial migration but long before the institution of the
postcolonial nation-state system that seeks to control mobility through
the imposition of borders to expunge Blackness from Europe -- or to
enclose Blackness within exploitative regimes of labour migration and
asylum. Hawthorne\'s lecture prompts reflection on what is metaphor,
what is analogy, and what is catachresis in representing the Black
Mediterranean. I began this brief commentary by quoting part of Emtithal
Mahmoud\'s poem, "Bird Watching on Lesvos Island" (Mahmoud, 2016).
Mahmoud makes powerful use of a metaphor, to speak back to power, as she
tries to make sense of incomprehensible loss, devastation, and survival
against an Aegean horizon. Yet, when analogies substitute for geographic
or historical analysis, they occlude more than they reveal. As
intersectionality suggests, analogies tend to do violence to both terms
in the analogy: both that which is positioned as already known and that
which we seek to know through the act of comparative juxtaposition.
**[Confronting the horizon over an aqueous cemetery; a violent border;
and a space of transhistorical, transgeographic Black survival and
resistance]{.underline}**, Hawthorne\'s "**[Black Mediterranean
Geographies" refuses the violence of so many bordered
gazes.]{.underline}**

Yellow Peril and Techno-Orientalism

The term yellow peril emerged in the late nineteenth century in response
to Japan's arrival to the geopolitical stage as a formidable military
and industrial contender to the Western powers of Europe and the United
States.9 The concept was further elaborated and given a tangible racial
form through Sax Rohmer's series of [novels and films that provided the
early content for the social imaginary of "**yellow peril**" along with
its personification in the character of **Dr. Fu Manchu**,]{.underline}
the iconic supervillain archetype of the Asian "evil criminal genius,"
and his cast of minions.10 Strikingly, Dr. Fu Manchu's characterization
as evil, criminal, and genius continues to inform the racial trope of
the Asian scientist spy; and more recently, we may add to the list the
bioengineer, the CFO, the international graduate student, to name just a
few. [Moreover, the notion of the non-differentiable "**yellow**"
**masses** continues to function as a **homogenizing** and
**dehumanizing** device of **Asian racialization**, which makes possible
the transference of Sinophobia to Asian xenophobia.]{.underline}

In its inherent attempt to construct a racial other, ["**yellow peril**"
is more a projection of **Western fear** than a representation of an
Asian object/subject, and in this sense, it may be better understood as
a **repository** of **racial affect** that can animate a myriad of
representational figures, images, and **discourses**,]{.underline}
depending on context. Indeed, the images and [discourses of yellow peril
have surfaced multiple times throughout the twentieth century, capturing
a multitude of **ever-shifting perceived threats** that range
from]{.underline} [the danger of **military intrusion** (i.e., Japanese
Americans during WWII), **economic competition** (i.e., Chinese laborers
in the late nineteenth century, Japan in the 1980s), Asian moral and
**cultural depravity** (i.e., non-Christian heathens, Chinese
prostitutes, opium smokers), **to biological inferiority** (i.e.,
effeminacy, disease carriers).]{.underline} As Colleen Lye observes,
"the incipient 'yellow peril' refers to a particular combinatory kind of
anticolonial \[and anti-West\] nationalism, in which the union of
Japanese technological advance and Chinese numerical mass confronts
Western civilization with a potentially unbeatable force."11 Arguably,
[the **yellow peril** of today represents heightened **Western
anxieties** around China's combined forces of **population size**,
global **economic growth**, and rapid technological-scientific
**innovation**]{.underline}---all of which emerge from a political
system that is considered ideologically oppositional to ours. [The
current context, we suggest, is best understood through the lens of
**techno-Orientalism**.]{.underline}

When the idea of techno-Orientalism first appeared in David Morley and
Kevin Robins's analysis of why Japan occupied such a threatening
position in Western imagination in the late 1980s, techno-Orientalism
offered a framework to make sense of the technologically imbued racist
stereotypes of Japan/the Japanese that were emerging within the context
of Western fears and anxieties around Japan's ascendancy as a
technological global power. They proposed that if technological
advancement has been crucial to Western civilizational progress, then
Japan's technological superiority over the West also signals a critical
challenge to Western hegemony, including its cultural authority to
control representations of the West and its "others." [They claimed that
the **shifting balance** in global power---the West's **loss of
technological preeminence**---has induced an **identity crisis** in the
West.]{.underline} In response, [techno-Orientalism, in which "\[idioms
of technology\] become structured into the discourse of Orientalism," is
produced in large part to discipline Japan and its rise to
techno-economic power.]{.underline}12 [The United States,]{.underline}
for instance, [externalized its anxiety into xenophobic projections of
Japan as a "culture that is cold, **impersonal**, and **machine-like**"
in which its people are "**sub-human**" and "**unfeeling
aliens**."]{.underline}13 Techno-Orientalism, born from the "Japan
Panic," was effectively consolidated through and around
political-economic concerns [that frame Japanese and, by extension,
Asian techno-capitalist progress as **dangerous** and
**dystopian**]{.underline}.

Analogous to Japan's position in the late 1980s, [China currently
figures into the **techno-Orientalist** imaginary as a powerful
competitor in **mass production**, a global **financial giant**, and an
**aggressive investor** in technological, infrastructural, and
scientific developments.]{.underline} At the same time, [the increasing
purchasing power of China provokes American fear of a future global
market that is economically driven by **Chinese consumptive** desires
and **practices**. It is this duality]{.underline}---the domination of
both production and consumption across different sectors of the
techno-capitalist global economy---[that undergirds **American
anxieties** of a **sinicized future**.]{.underline}16

[Further amplifying these **anxieties** around Chinese techno-economic
domination is our imagination of China/the Chinese as the **ultimate
yellow peril**, whose state ideology]{.underline} is oppositional to
that of the United States and whose [unmatched population size combined
with its economic expansion and technological advancements may actually
pose a real **challenge** to U.S. **global hegemony**.]{.underline} We
turn now to examine how the ideology of yellow peril is manifesting in
the current context of techno-Orientalism, beginning first with an
analysis of the racial trope of "Chinese as contagion" and its
connection to anti-Asian aggression.

In the early weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States,
President Trump put out many mixed messages, but he remained consistent
with one---that [China was to blame for the]{.underline} spread of [the
virus]{.underline}. Repeatedly, he insisted on [calling]{.underline} the
novel [corona]{.underline}virus ["the Chinese virus,"]{.underline}
despite mounting public criticism against the racialization of the
deadly pathogen. Many noted the inflammatory nature of this anti-Asian
rhetoric. During this same period, [[reports ranging from]{.mark} verbal
[**abuse** to]{.mark} intimidation to **[physical assault]{.mark}**
against people of Asian descent [documented the]{.mark} sudden [rise of
anti-Asian **hate crimes**]{.mark} in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and globally]{.underline}. According to Human
Rights Watch, [an Asian woman in Brooklyn]{.underline}, New York,
[suffered a racially motivated **[acid attack]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and in Texas, [a Burmese American man and his two [children were
**stabbed**]{.mark} by a man who claimed he thought the family was
"Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus."]{.underline}1 The
[A]{.underline}sian [P]{.underline}acific [P]{.underline}olicy and
Planning Council in the United States [reported [over **one thousand
cases**]{.mark} of anti-Asian incidents **[in a two-week
period]{.mark}**]{.underline} in March 2020.2 Outside the United States,
[a Singaporean [student]{.mark}]{.underline} in the United Kingdom
[[was]{.mark} violently [**kicked** and **punched**]{.mark} by an angry
group of men]{.underline} after they uttered, "we don't want your
coronavirus in our country" (my emphasis).3 [In Australia, a
survey]{.underline} taken by the community group Asian Australian
Alliance [recorded]{.underline} a total of 178 [reports of anti-Asian
incidents]{.underline} in two weeks, [ranging from **[racial
slurs]{.mark}** to **physical assault.**]{.underline}4 Though President
Trump has dropped the "Chinese virus" for "kung flu" and tweeted on
March 23 that "It is very important that we totally protect our Asian
American community . . . the spreading of the virus is NOT their fault,"
it seems that Sinophobia and racial violence against Asian Americans
have been unleashed.

Make no mistake, as long as President Trump continues to take a
confrontational stance, using the **[[rhetoric of blame against
China]{.underline}]{.mark}** with the intention to punish it with new
sanctions, tariffs, and even the cancellation of U.S. debt obligations,5
the **[[racial aggressions]{.mark} against Asian Americans [will
continue to rise]{.mark},]{.underline}** if not intensify. By now, it is
widely accepted that the novel coronavirus emerged first in Wuhan, and
scientists believe that the zoonotic disease might have jumped from
animals to humans at Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a wet
market where vegetables, seafood, meat, and a small number of exotic
wildlife were sold. Despite this, on April 30, President Trump casually
offered a new theory, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted: that
COVID had originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which houses a
biosafety level-4 lab, and that the virus might have "leaked" from that
lab. The implicit suggestion is that China had either intentionally
bioengineered the novel coronavirus to cause massive destruction,
thereby attributing malice, or carelessly leaked the virus due to
scientific negligence, thereby attributing incompetence. In either case,
these kinds of unsubstantiated [speculations work to further stoke anger
and disdain against the Chinese state.]{.underline} More disturbingly,
[they traffic in the idea of China as a biotechnology threat, resonating
with pre-existing filmic representations of futuristic dystopian
worlds.]{.underline}

The immediate and unqualified responses from the scientific community
reveal the danger of these potentially incendiary speculations.
Responding swiftly, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
issued a press release the morning of April 30 stating that "The
Intelligence Community . . . concurs with the wide scientific consensus
that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified . . . "
(my emphasis).6 Within days, the director of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, attested that the
virus "could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated."7
These assertions sought to extinguish any attribution of malice to the
Chinese state. Even with firm contestation, however, **[[the very
invocation of]{.mark}]{.underline}** the idea of
**[[biotech]{.mark}nology warfare [has]{.mark}]{.underline}** tapped
into and perhaps even **[[fueled]{.mark}]{.underline}** our existing
**[[techno-Orientalist anxieties.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

As the COVID pandemic story transpires in real time, engulfing the
entire global community, taking unexpected twists and turns, making
divergences and transgressions, we have become increasingly aware that
the layers of entanglements cannot be easily parsed out, nor will we
know anytime soon how and when the story will end. We offer a query into
how we might assess and make sense of the intensifying Sinophobia and
xenophobia in this current context. To do so, [we must resist the
temptation to confine our analysis to the narrow parameters of the
pandemic.]{.underline} Rather, [we insist on examining the rise of
[anti-Asian aggression within]{.mark} the]{.underline} concomitant
[vectors of [the **pandemic,** ]{.mark}**the**]{.underline} escalation
of the U.S.-China **[[trade war, and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the growing
[**concerns about [cyber-]{.mark} and
techno-[security.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Here we assert that the
**[[ideology of yellow peril set within a techno-Orientalist imaginary
is]{.mark} powerfully [animating t]{.mark}he racial form and [racial
affect]{.mark} mediating the multiple terrains of public health,
technology, global trade, and national security.]{.underline}** While it
is tempting to treat this historical conjuncture as extraordinary, [it
is crucial that we situate the current unfolding within the long history
of Asian racialization]{.underline}, one that indexes the abiding
tension between the political impetus to define national belonging and
the shifting economic imperatives of the nation-state.8

The Contemporary Racial Repertoire of the "China/Chinese" Threat

The outbreak of the pandemic could not have had worse timing (as if it
could be timed), but timing is critically important here. Its emergence
amid the ongoing intensive trade war between the United States and China
is significant in that the prevailing tensions between the two countries
and the discourses of Chinese unfair trade competition, scientific
espionage, and technological surveillance frame the reception of the
pandemic. One may argue that President Trump's insistence on blaming
China for the spread of the deadly virus is yet another tactic in his
administration's sustained attempt to quell China's economic power at
the same time that it provides a foil to distract from---and a scapegoat
to blame for---the economic and public health crisis in which we find
ourselves.

At this particular juncture, [we]{.underline} unfortunately [have been
inundated with media coverage of a plethora of accusations and actions
launched against China and Chinese Americans.]{.underline} Within the
past two years, we have witnessed the implementation of trade sanctions
and tariffs against China, the removal of prominent Chinese American
scientists from research institutions, and the severing of nationwide
economic transactions with certain China-based telecommunications
corporations, with Huawei Technologies Company being the most notable.
[All these have been advanced in the name of [national
security]{.mark}.]{.underline} The discursive formation and the
[[representational devices]{.mark} that have been used to justify these
state directives play a critical role in [construct]{.mark}ing
the]{.underline} People's Republic of China [[(PRC) as culprit
and]{.mark} as America's enemy number one.]{.underline} [These
constructions]{.underline}, some of which will be examined in this
essay, [are layered]{.underline} upon one another, [each
building]{.underline} and elaborating [on the last, and
each]{.underline} invoking and simultaneously [[inciting]{.mark} a
different set of [anxieties]{.mark}]{.underline} that lie within the
broader repertoire of China/ Chinese as threat. Indeed, **[[the
inundation of media]{.mark} about China [makes it]{.mark}]{.underline}**
difficult, if not **[[impossible, to decipher truth from]{.mark}
falsehood]{.underline}**, myth from reality, **[rhetoric from [evidence.
Our task]{.mark}]{.underline}** here **[[is]{.mark} [not to
weigh]{.mark} the [truth-value]{.mark} of these
rep]{.underline}**resentation**[s [but to treat them as ongoing
contests]{.mark} embedded in power [and]{.mark}]{.underline}** to
**[[draw out their material effects.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It is worth
noting that [[while the]{.mark} explicit [target]{.mark}]{.underline} of
U.S. state aggression [[has been the]{.mark} mainland Chinese state or
the [PRC**, the actual effects are**]{.mark} much more wide-ranging and
extend into **[everyday aggressions against all those who present as
East Asian American.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In our examination of]{.underline} the variegated [representations of
China]{.underline}/Chinese, we suggest that [the]{.underline}
longstanding [ideology of ["yellow peril" remains]{.mark} not just
pertinent, but [extremely forceful]{.mark} in constructing a
multifaceted repertoire of Chinese state threat and, by extension, of
Chinese/Asian American threat. What is particular about this recent
iteration of yellow peril is its configuration [through]{.mark} the lens
of [techno-Orientalism]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} a framework that
is primarily used to examine the explicitly fictional genres of novels,
videogames, and films but that we now assert as being actively deployed
in this current historical conjuncture.

II Governing through emergency

A range of work in geography and allied fields has traced the work
emergency does in the advent and (re)production of existing and new
forms, practices and relations of power. Stimulated by the 'war on
terror', [research has shown how contemporary [liberal order is secured
by governing through]{.mark} the logics of [Emergency]{.mark} with a
capital E]{.underline} (Adey, 2016; Amin, 2013; Agamben, 2007; Anderson,
2015; Aradau, 2015; Cooper, 2008; Dillon and Reid, 2009; Grove, 2013;
Graham, 2011; Massumi, 2009). On the one hand, [events or situations
which are designated as emergencies are governed in ways that are
designed to contain and curtail classes of events, and people that are
designated as threats to an existing order. Governing through
emergencies primarily hinges on draining an event of its eventfulness,
by reducing its potentiality to disrupt, end, or overturn.]{.underline}
On the other hand, [liberal order governs through emergency in the sense
that claims to an emergency -- sometimes strategic declarations that an
emergency has happened, is happening or will happen -- can justify
actions that (re)order bodies and relations for pre-existing
reasons.]{.underline} Within this broad emphasis on 'governing through
emergency', two main lines of research have developed.

First, a line of research concerned with emergency as exception has
unpacked the work that the 'state of emergency' as juridical-political
category and instrument does in the (re)making and (re)ordering of
spaces and bodies (Neal, 2006; Coleman, 2007; Braun and McCarthy, 2005).
Here the emphasis is less on the materialities and affects of the event
designated as an emergency, and more on what is enabled through the act
of formal declaration and the acts that follow. Building on Agamben's
(1998) neo-Schmittian engagement with sovereignty and the exception,
research has disclosed the intensely uneven geographies of exclusion
that are founded through the 'state of emergency', and the myriad ways
in which people suffer and are damaged in the name of emergency. This
emphasis on [the 'state of emergency' reflects the fact that emergency
declarations and subsequent actions often reveal the relation between
democratic life and its authoritarian others as fractured and
fragmented]{.underline} (Ophir 2007[). In a 'state of emergency' visible
impacts and effects of power manifest in and through bodies, typically
framed in terms of the production of 'bare life']{.underline} (Agamben
1998). [Research into racial violence]{.underline} following Hurricane
Katrina (Braun and McCarthy, 2005) and the 2010 Haiti earthquake
(Mullings et al., 2010), for instance, [shows how action in a state of
emergency draws on and reproduces black disaster victims as disposable
lives]{.underline} (Giroux, 2006) [while pursuing a goal of sustaining
the existing socio-ecological order.]{.underline}

A second strand of work troubles this emphasis on the 'state of
emergency' by approaching emergency as one technique of liberal rule
amongst others. [[Governing through emergencies]{.mark} happens through
innumerable mundane techniques designed to enable either the
continuation or swift return of the non-emergency everyday. **These
techniques [include]{.mark}**]{.underline} exercises (Anderson and Adey,
2012; Schoch-Spana, 2004; O'Grady, 2016), shelters (Fredricksen, 2014),
**[[scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}** (De Goede, 2008; De Goede and
Randalls, 2009), **[[and participatory activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Grove, 2014a). This research examines: the problem that situations
designated as emergencies pose for governance; efforts to grasp such
situations and render them actionable as emergencies; and how the
practical operation of particular techniques of governance change what
an event is and might become (De Goede and Randalls, 2009; Lakoff and
Collier, 2008; Lentzos and Rose, 2009). [Governing through emergencies
is shown to involve a set of disparate, partially connected activities
that happen through spatially distributed networks of anticipation
including]{.underline}: forms of preparedness, preemption and precaution
action (Amoore, 2013; De Goede and Randalls, 2009; Cooper, 2008; Lakoff,
2007; Massumi, 2009)); detectiondiagnosis (Luque-Ayala and Marvin,
2016); and response and recovery (Anderson, 2015). Rather than a
juridico-legal category confined to the spaces and topologies of the
exception, [governing through emergencies appears here as simultaneously
ordinary and extraordinary, materializing in scenes and situations of
emergency, before returning to the background life of otherwise
unexceptional spaces]{.underline} (see, for example, Barker, 2012; Hu,
2018).

Despite important differences, work on emergency-as-exception and
emergency-as technique emphasize how [emergency as a juridical-political
category]{.underline}, set of governmental techniques, and atmosphere
[functions to sustain liberal rule.]{.underline} Following MacIntyre's
(1989: 345) assertion that [liberalism's teleological goal is 'no more
and no less than the continued sustenance of liberal and social order',
emergency is at once an occasion in which liberal rule is placed in
question and (re)consolidated. Governing through emergency promises to
bring events to an end by attempting to (re)produce recognizable
cyclical or linear sequences]{.underline} of, for example,
order-growth-development, disruption stabilization-recovery, or
disruption-adaptation transformation. The goal is to drain an event of
its eventfulness, making it into a recognized, completed happening and
bringing the potentiality that the term emergency gestures towards to an
end. This foreclosure of potentiality is by no means always a problem;
as Povinelli (2011) reminds us, the burden of becoming-otherwise is
often unevenly distributed. But [it becomes a problem as it is harnessed
to the goal of perpetuating liberal order, and emergency and disaster
management are transformed into forms of 'institutionalized anti-action'
designed to 'ward off unexpected novelty' and 'block contingency rather
than exploit its opportunity']{.underline} (Hu, 2018: 103).

Work on 'governing through emergencies' offers and rests on a critique
of how governing through emergency ends, forecloses or redirects
potentiality and thus (re)produces harmful or damaging conditions in the
name of securing existing order. While it has mainly focused on liberal
democracies in the Global North (exceptions including Hu, 2018, and
Grove, 2013, 2014a, 2014b), we take four key points from this
literature. First, 'governing through emergencies' orientates inquiry to
how and with what consequences events or situations are claimed and
thereafter related to as 'emergencies': claims of emergency demand
action from those who govern, and it is important to attend to how
subsequent in-action generates its own harms. Second, how certain events
and situations become more perceptible and actionable than others is an
important line of inquiry. Activist, public and artist claims of
emergency often go unheard, ignored, or are dismissed by the state and
other apparatuses through which emergencies are governed. Third, how
everyday lives are partly composed through the techniques, objects,
institutions and practices of governing through emergency requires
exploration. Emergency techniques, objects and so on are encountered and
become palpable with the atmospheres and moods that give everyday lives
a particular feel.

Finally, work on 'governing through emergencies' reminds us that [the
relation between emergency and the everyday is at stake in emergency
governance.]{.underline} [Everyday habits, practices, and events may be
governed as a source of potential or proto emergencies]{.underline},
with governing happening as dispersed phenomena across multiple sites
and scenes in addition to visible, punctual scenes of emergency. This
final point importantly connects to longstanding questions on what
counts as a time-space of emergency when the line between exceptional
and everyday becomes blurred. Walter Benjamin's (1968: 257) observation
that ['the tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the "state of
emergency" in which we live is not the exception but the rule' has
shaped]{.underline} anthropologists' and geographers' [studies of banal
forms of violence throughout the Global South]{.underline} (e.g.
Taussig, 1992; Scheper-Hughes, 1992; Das, 2007; Rose, 2014). More
recently, geographers and other critical theorists have turned to
concepts including ['slow violence']{.underline} (Nixon, 2011[) and
'slow death']{.underline} (Berlant, 2011) to [examine how racially and
economically uneven processes of environment (in)justice fold harm,
suffering, risk and premature death into the fabric of everyday
life]{.underline}, particularly among poor and marginalized communities.
Taken together, this and other research highlights that
**[emergency]{.underline}** is not only a dry juridical category, but
**[signals a form of life structured through biopolitical techniques and
mechanisms of racialization that delimit what lives can and should be
exposed to banal forms of exceptional violence.]{.underline}** The next
section explores the multiple time-spaces of this form of Anderson et
al. 5 life -- what we are calling here racializing emergency.

III Racializing emergency

One of the more influential literatures in geography on everyday
violence comes from work on environmental racism. Drawing variously on,
inter alia, black geographies, political ecology, and feminist
geography, this body of research reflects Ruth Wilson Gilmore's (2007:
28) [definition of racism as the 'state sanctioned and/or extralegal
production and exploitation of group-differentiated vulnerabilities to
premature death'.]{.underline} In contrast to interpretations of racism
as subjective prejudices, [Gilmore's approach directs attention towards
structurally-produced forms of violence that have created and sustained
capitalist political ecological order and continue to do so]{.underline}
in the present day. Illustrating this approach, Katherine McKittrick
(2013) demonstrates how [colonialism operated through a geographic
language of racial condemnation that created both difference and value
in colonial economies: the figure of the black slave that embodied the
possibility of violence without limits.]{.underline} Here, [blackness is
less an indicator of phenotypic difference than a political, juridical
and philosophical category that constructed certain spaces as unlivable
and marked those inhabiting these areas as less-than-human.]{.underline}
This racialized designation formed the material and discursive
foundations for the emergence of the uniquely European experience of
finitude. The temporal experience of the future as an open-ended domain
of progressive change, growth and betterment, amenable to human
intervention and calculated improvement (Dillon, 1996), emerged
literally on the backs of enslaved peoples from the African continent
designated as 'black', whose forced labor and premature death in
plantation economies created previously unimaginable sources of wealth
and prosperity for European slave traders and slave owners (Thomas,
2016; Smith and Vasudevan, 2017).

[These 'racialized imaginative geographies of the
uninhabitable']{.underline} (McKittrick, 2013: 7) [continue to shape the
present.]{.underline} McKittrick (2013: 7) stresses that:

> in our present moment, some live in the unlivable, and to live in the
> unlivable condemns the geographies of marginalized to death over and
> over again. Life, then, is extracted from particular regions,
> transforming some places into inhuman rather than human geographies.

Geographic work on environmental (in)justice has unpacked how this
['geographic management of blackness' plays out in contemporary liberal
societies.]{.underline} For example, Pulido's (2000) seminal study of
environmental racism in Los Angeles demonstrates how the urban landscape
has been shaped by historical trajectories of white residents' movement
away from both polluted industrial areas and minority neighborhoods.
[Whiteness]{.underline} -- and white privilege [-- is produced in this
relational movement away from spaces and communities marked as 'black'
and thus subject to greater levels of hazardous material exposure. [The
exposure of black bodies to]{.mark}]{.underline} harmful contaminants,
and their resulting poor health and [[premature death, operates]{.mark}
not onl[y through]{.mark} direct and intentional means, but also through
more insidious and [banal practices]{.mark} that produce the toxic
environments these bodies inhabit]{.underline} (Bullard, 2000; Tse,
2007; Mohai and Saha, 2015).

This literature has increasingly drawn on Rob [Nixon's]{.underline}
(2009, 2011) concept of [slow violence and]{.underline} Achille
[Mbembe's]{.underline} (2003) concept of '[necropolitics']{.underline}
to [unpack how power differentials unevenly distribute risk and harm in
late modern capitalist societies.]{.underline} Nixon deploys slow
violence to think through the subtle transformations in the spatial and
temporal organization of violence under conditions of what Ulrich Beck
refers to as 'reflexive modernization'. Beck foregrounds how the
[institutions that]{.underline} structured modern societies throughout
much of the 20th century, such as the territorially-bounded
nation-state, full employment, and the maledominated nuclear family,
have increasingly become destabilized in recent decades (Beck et al.,
2003). While these institutions formerly provided the (white, male)
modern individual with a sense of security and stability, their gradual
erosion creates qualitatively new experiences of insecurity. Reading
spectacular catastrophes such as the 1983 Bhopal chemical explosion and
1986 Chernobyl meltdown against the grain, he argues that the
[violence]{.underline} of these events [is not confined to the immediate
time-space of the event itself. Rather, the effects slowly reverberate
across affected spaces and populations, gradually producing mutations,
diseases, and debilitating injuries that erode vital capacities. But
these [drawn-out]{.mark}, attritional after-[effects fail to
receive]{.mark}]{.underline} the media attention and [[public
concern]{.underline}]{.mark} these disasters initially received.
[Instead, they produce new subjectivities striving to survive in and
through risky, inhospitable landscapes.]{.underline} Thus, while some
adherents to Beck's risk society thesis maintain that late-modern
societies can be characterized by the democratization of catastrophic
risk (see Bougen, 2003), Nixon demonstrates how the [slow violence of
advanced modernity is not evenly distributed across the
population.]{.underline}

Environmental racism scholars have begun to articulate Nixon's arguments
alongside Mbembe's (2001, 2003) sense of necropolitics to understand how
this uneven geography of **[[slow violence is shaped by racializing
assemblages]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or various legal and extra-legal
techniques **[[that]{.mark} produce differences within the population
and [expose some]{.mark} segments [to premature
death]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Pulido, 2017; Davies, 2018). In short,
Mbembe offers necropolitics as a corrective to Agamben's formulation of
bare life and sovereignty. For Mbembe, the colony, rather than the camp,
is the paradigmatic scene where exceptional violence -- the sovereign
decision on the state of exception that brings the figures of both the
sovereign and bare life into being -- is contingent on banal practices
that sustain colonial rule. **[Necropolitics names those techniques and
practices that produce death-spaces inhabited by colonized subjects
whose lives carry no juridical or theological value.]{.underline}**
Thus, for some researchers, **[slow violence signals 'a form of
late-modern necropolitics, where communities are exposed to the power of
death-in-life']{.underline}** (Davies, 2018: 1540). For example, Thom
Davies' research into the lived experience of toxic environments in the
US's so-called 'Cancer Alley' is rooted in a recognition that:

> just as Mbembe's colonialized bodies were kept in a state of gradual
> injury through processes of imperial domination, Nixon's
> interpretation of slow violence shows how the uneven spread of
> globalization and pollution also keeps marginalized groups in
> situations and spaces of wounded subjugation. (Davies, 2018: 1540)

Similarly, Randi Gressgard's (2019) innovative approach to urban
resilience juxtaposes research on the necropolitics of colonialism with
urban splintering to understand how [[practices of urban securitization
are situated in antiblack racism and settler colonialism.]{.mark} These
engagements with necropolitics draw out how [contemporary forms of
rule]{.mark} enact a subtle form of death-politics: the production of
necropolitical geographies that [render some places deathworlds]{.mark}
whose slow forms of violence do not elicit shock or emergency
response.]{.underline}

However, Jared Sexton (2010) cautions against Mbembe's tendency to blur
qualitatively distinct forms of racialized violence. In Sexton's
reading, Mbembe effaces the distinction between contingent violence that
maintains colonial rule and the structural violence of slavery. He
argues that by positioning slavery as one instance of a general
phenomenon of modern terror, Mbembe loses track of

> the singular commodification of human existence (not simply its
> \[instrumentalized\] labor power) Anderson et al. 7 under racial
> slavery, that structure of gratuitous violence in which a body is
> rendered as flesh to be accumulated and exchanged. (Sexton, 2010: 38)

Flesh is key to Sexton's insistence that the experience of blackness is
irreducible to that of other paradigmatic figures of modern
deathpolitics in Agamben and Mbembe's thought, such as the colonized
subject or the refugee. [Flesh is not biological; it materializes
through racializing assemblages that inscribe racialized imaginaries
onto human physiology]{.underline} (Weheliye, 2014). It thus offers an
alternative to both the representational understandings of race and the
abstract, ontological understandings of bare life that undergird Mbembe
and Agamben's readings of death-politics. It highlights the
contextually- specific [[social formations]{.mark} -- such as the New
World plantation society -- that, [for African and indigenous peoples,
are scenes of]{.mark} actual rather than potential [mutilation,
dismemberment and exile]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Sexton (2010), the
social death that results from this 'theft of the body' (Spillers, 1987)
distinguishes slavery's structural violence from the colony's contingent
violence: the terror-formation Mbembe attributes to colonialism is
already institutionalized in the structure of chattel slavery that
denies the black subject kinship ties and mandates total submission of
the enslaved before all whites.

While these arguments on racialized violence appear somewhat removed
from work on governing Emergencies, they point to the racialized
foundations of modern biopolitics that both Agambenian- and
Foucauldian-inflected work bypass. If, as we saw above, the contextually
[specific transformation of persons into mere 'flesh' precedes any
biopolitical division]{.underline} of the population into
decontextualized categories of bare life (zoe) and valued life (bios),
then the bios -- **[the [valued life in need of security]{.mark} and
development -- [always carries with it the antihumanist negation of
black flesh]{.mark} as its historical condition of
possibility.]{.underline}** Saidiya Hartman's (1997) influential
genealogy of freedom in the pre- and post-Civil War US offers an
alternative account of how biology and politics intertwine. As she
details, the definition of the slave's legal status also established the
scope of rights and liberties of the freed. This system of rights,
liberties and privileges in white supremacist societies gave rise to
particular experiences of daily life for white subjects that shaped
normative expectations for how 'valued life' as such should unfold.
Thus, post-emancipation and post-war legal struggles to eradicate
discrimination revolved around the question of how to delimit black
'freedom' in a white supremacist society that continued to be structured
around the exclusive privileges and value of whiteness. Biology -- in
the form of blood -- became the means for managing life through the Jim
Crow-era 'separate but equal' doctrine. [The subject's bloodline
determined their capacity to claim the rights and privileges of
whiteness, and determined the capacity of the state and other white
subjects to legally deny those privileges to subjects marked as
black.]{.underline} [Thus, the expectations and comforts of whiteness
were secured by white subjects through the continued classification of
racialized subjects and the definition of the limits of their
freedom.]{.underline}

Hartman's analysis thus shows how [the valued life that modern
biopolitics takes as its object is an effect of racializing assemblages
that extend the violence and deprivations of slavery into the present
day. **The possibility for specifying and [managing]{.mark} various
forms of [collective life through]{.mark} techniques of [emergency
governance are]{.mark} thus [founded on a 'corporeal politics spanning
the divide between slavery and freedom']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Hartman,
1997: 9) **[[that makes]{.mark} possible the experience of [the
future]{.mark} as openended and in need of securing [through
denying]{.mark} the possibility [of this future to black spaces]{.mark}
and subjects.]{.underline}**

This argument offers an important corrective to work on governing
Emergencies and slow violence by revealing that modern biopolitics
carries within it multiple temporal registers that 8 Progress in Human
Geography XX(X) express uneven and shifting economies of harm, suffering
and insecurity within liberal societies. The anticipatory and open-ended
temporality of the liberal subject is constitutively conjoined with at
least two additional temporalities. First, [the durative temporality of
slow violence]{.underline} is not confined to contemporary late-modern
societies, but [defines the black experience of modernity since its
inception in racialized slavery. The temporality of blackness as
**[social death is]{.mark}**]{.underline} not growth and development,
[**but an [incalculable,]{.mark} endured time [with no interval or
break.]{.mark}** **[This 'stalled present']{.mark}**]{.underline} of
'arrested movement' (Scott, 2014: 6) [**[offers no promise of]{.mark}**
transformation, betterment or **[improvement, only]{.mark}** the
**[exhaustion]{.mark}** that comes from striving to endure unlivable
worlds.]{.underline} As Sexton (2010: 64) emphasizes, ['to be black in
an antiblack world \... is to be inundated and under assault at every
turn, pushed into an endlessly kinetic movement; which is to say
subjected to an open and absolute vulnerability.']{.underline}

[This persistent 'open and absolute vulnerability]{.underline}'
encompasses and [exceeds both slow violence and
necropolitics.]{.underline} [But at the same time, [we do not read
blackness as]{.mark} an absolute, [ontological]{.mark} category
--]{.underline} following McKittrick (2016), [we do not reduce black
lives to death. [Instead]{.mark}]{.underline}, Weheliye's (2014)
attention to [[racializing assemblages directs attention to]{.mark} the
way the [structural violence]{.mark} of racial capitalism hinges on
topologically pliant and contextually [specific configurations]{.mark}
of different racializing techniques whose precise arrangement conditions
the specific content of blackness as such]{.underline}. In this sense,
[the slow violence of late-modern societies is thus a topologically
recalibrated form of the exposure to harm, suffering and premature death
that has structured blackness since the slave plantation.]{.underline}
As McKittrick (2013: 4) emphasizes, the plantation 'uncovers a logic
that emerges in the present and folds over to repeat itself anew
throughout black lives'. **[This repetition of plantation violence --
the recurrent demand for black social death as the possibility for
liberal freedom -- signals a second alternative temporality of
modernity: the simultaneity of past, present and future that collapses
open-ended futurity into a stalled present of enduring the violence of
social death]{.underline}** (Thomas, 2016). Christina Sharpe (2016)
characterizes this simultaneity in terms of living in the wake of
slavery. As a metaphor, wake signals an ongoing disturbance that folds
the past into the present. Sharpe emphasizes that

> living in the wake on a global level means living the disastrous time
> and effects of continued marked migrations, Mediterranean and
> Caribbean disasters, trans-American and African migration, structural
> adjustment imposed by the International Monetary Fund that continues
> imperalisms/colonialisms, and more. (Sharpe, 2016: 15)

Taken together, stalled time and disastrous time allow us to rethink the
biopolitics of emergency governance in a way that situates liberalism's
anticipatory temporalities in relation to its constitutive racialized
temporalities of duration and simultaneity. [The life that emergency
governance takes as its object carries with it multiple temporalities:
the open-ended futurity of the white liberal subject and the
repetitive]{.underline} and durative [temporalities of black and
indigenous subjects enduring the wake of slavery and genocide that
denies these subjects the possibility of a future]{.underline} (Smith
and Vasudevan, 2017). In this light, the biopolitics of emergency
governance revolves around the uneven re/distribution of these distinct
temporalities of modernity throughout the population. In clear
distinction from all-encompassing visions of emergency and violence
found in some Agambenian- and Foucauldian-inspired research, this
reframing of biopolitics encourages us to look beyond the foreclosure of
potentiality that works on governing through emergency details, and
instead attend to expressions of actually-existing difference in the
present that emerge out of and against contextually-specific racializing
assemblages. The challenge here is to practice what Anderson et al. 9 we
might call racializing emergency: racializing emergency involves
situating emergency claims in particular socio-spatial contexts to
examine how they contest the distribution of anticipatory, repetitive
and durative temporalities and the forms of harm and suffering that are
exercised through these uneven spatiotemporal geographies.

[**[Explicitly recognizing]{.mark}** the **[racializing
assemblages]{.mark} that structure liberal biopolitics [foregrounds the
centrality of blackness to]{.mark} the modern category of
[emergency]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and thus points to the need for critical
analyses of emergency governance to take on board the coexistence of
anticipatory, repetitive and durative temporalities. [This
decentering]{.mark}]{.underline} move [radically [opens]{.mark} up the
relation between power and life that has been a central concern of
research on governing Emergencies.]{.underline} As our review outlined
above, geographers commonly read this relation in terms of governmental
apparatuses that attempt to strategically control individual and
collective life processes (a power over life) and an ontologically prior
constitutive power of collective life. But [this vision of a pluripotent
life capable of generating [new becomings]{.mark} must be radically
expanded in light of the multiplicity of unevenly distributed
temporalities that structure liberal order.]{.underline} In particular,
[analysis needs [to account for a prior political economy of
racialization]{.mark} that produces this uneven distribution in the
first place.]{.underline} This opens the question of the threshold
between different forms of modern life that are differentially governed
through emergency logics and techniques. Importantly, **[[this is
not]{.mark} an [ontological]{.mark} threshold]{.underline}** that
ultimately resolves into a clear Agambenian distinction between a valued
life of the polis (bios) and the expendable life of homo sacer (zoe).
[Rather, this is a mutable and mobile threshold that is continually
re/produced and challenged through the contextually-specific interplay
of force relations, techniques, knowledges and strategies that
differentially inscribes racial categories onto specific
bodies]{.underline}, which are then open to being governed in some ways
rather than others (Baldwin, 2012). In short, **[[governing through
emergency hinges on a prior politics of racialization]{.mark} that
renders some lives governable through liberal techniques of emergency
rule, and others not.]{.underline}**

As Hartman (1997) patiently details, [this politics of [racialization
allows]{.mark}]{.underline} some [([white) subjects to claim protections
from the state]{.mark}]{.underline} (or, we could add, any institution
that governs) [[on the basis of]{.mark} an expected future of growth,
[security]{.mark} and development, [and withholds the possibility of
this claim from]{.mark}]{.underline} other [([black/Indigenous)
subjects]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also Povinelli, 2011). Racializing
emergency allows us to approach Emergency as one sphere among others of
liberal rule in which subjects may advance these claims. [Emergency
claims draw on and reiterate the racialized distribution of
temporalities that structures liberal life.]{.underline} In doing so,
[racializing emergency opens a space of indeterminacy between emergency
and life foreclosed by accounts of Emergency governance that equate
liberal life with a purely anticipatory temporality. T]{.underline}o
rethink the spatio-temporal structure of liberal life thus also demands
that we rethink the spatio-temporal structure of emergency as one
terrain of liberal biopolitics. In the penultimate section, we
articulate the concept of slow emergency to think through emergency
governance in relation to a racialized understanding of emergency.

### 2AC -- Plan Consequences Key 

**Debate should be centered on the [consequences of the
plan]{.underline}---comparing [opportunity costs]{.underline} is best
for [clash]{.underline} and [argument refinement]{.underline}, which is
a [prerequisite]{.underline} to making critique and activism portable.**

**Fairclough and Fairclough, 18**---emeritus Professor of Linguistics at
Lancaster University AND School of Humanities and Social Sciences,
University of Central Lancashire (Norman and Isabela, "A procedural
approach to ethical critique in CDA," Critical Discourse Studies Volume
15, 2018 - Issue 2, 169-185) \[CDA=critical discourse analysis\]

The term 'discourse ethics' is Habermas's (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012:
30-34), but we are using it here in a general sense: for the view that
[an **adequate [framework for ethical evaluation]{.mark}** and
**critique [must include]{.mark} the comparison** and **evaluation of
different [arguments for]{.mark} different lines of [action]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}in a process of deliberation]{.underline}. Such assessments of
arguments pose difficult problems, and deliberation is by no means
guaranteed to produce consensus. Nevertheless, [[deliberation can
**contribute to** ]{.mark}**the quality of ethical [critique]{.mark}**
[by ensuring]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} **wide [range of arguments are
considered]{.mark}** in making decisions, that all alternatives are
**taken into account** and **thoroughly criticized**, and that people
have to (at least) **moderate their own partialities** in evaluating a
range of arguments collectively]{.underline}. To illustrate this, we
shall refer to two ethically contentious political decisions and the
courses of action which they led to. The first is the decision by the
British Prime Minister Tony Blair to advocate Britain's participation in
the invasion of Iraq in 2003 (we have discussed this in Fairclough &
Fairclough 2012: 96-97). The second is the decision by the German
Chancellor Angela Merkel to open Germany's borders to the refugees
coming from the Middle East in the autumn of 2015. In so doing, we will
illustrate the relevance of ethical critique from all three of the major
ethical positions: deontological, consequentialist and virtue ethics.
CDA and practical argumentation CDA is mainly concerned with [critical
analysis of discourse]{.underline} which [is **oriented to
action**]{.underline}, including political discourse, but also
managerial, organisational and other forms of discourse. [The **primary
activity** in such discourse is **practical
argumentation**]{.underline}, argumentation over action, [over **[what
is to be done]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. **[[what policies should be
adopted]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [Practical argumentation
should]{.underline} accordingly [be the **primary analytical
focus**]{.underline} in CDA (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012). [This
**[does not exclude other]{.mark}**]{.underline} familiar **[forms of
analysis]{.underline}** ([such as **[analysing
rep]{.mark}resentation[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}[) [but subsumes
them.]{.underline} ]{.mark}[The point of]{.underline} representing (or
['framing']{.underline}) [an issue in a particular way is to **create
particular**]{.underline} public [**attitudes** and **opinions**, and
thus **legitimize** or **facilitate a particular course of
action**.]{.underline} Critique of discourse is the focal concern for
CDA, but critique of discourse is by no means exclusive to CDA. On the
contrary, [critique of discourse]{.underline} is a normal part of all
discourse. It [is a **normal part of everyday practical argumentation**:
people **find reasons in favour** and **against proposals for action**,
they **consider alternatives**, **adopt them** or **discard them**, and
so on[. A course of action **worthy of being adopted** is **one that has
withstood criticism**]{.mark}. Agents may decide to discard proposals
either because they are **likely to be instrumentally inadequate** iun
relation to the goals they are supposed to achieve, or because they find
them **ethically problematic**]{.underline}, for example because the
values or goals they are motivated by are unacceptable. Ethical critique
is a concern for CDA at three levels: as an aspect of agents' reasoning,
for example as an aspect of politicians' deliberation over what policy
to adopt; as an aspect of the normative critique of those deliberative
practices which CDA carries out; as an aspect of the critique that CDA
itself is open to. There are therefore three main places where ethical
values come into the picture: what values are arguers (e.g. politicians)
arguing from? what are the values that CDA analysts are espousing, from
the perspective of which they are evaluating the arguments of those
arguers? what are the values of other critics (including critics of
CDA)? [CDA]{.underline} is itself a form of discourse, which is
specialized for academic critique of social actions, events, practices
and structures, with a focus on discourse. It [can itself be viewed as a
**form of practical argumentation**]{.underline} (Fairclough 2013),
[open to the **same critical questions** that it directs at the
discourse it subjects to critique]{.underline}. CDA practitioners are
bound by an obligation to address ethical evaluations that are critical
of their work. Moreover, [the ethical judgement which is part of the
normative critique carried out]{.underline} in CDA [**does not come out
of thin air**, but is built upon elements drawn selectively from ethical
judgement and critique in public discourse]{.underline}. And CDA needs
to rethink its own critique in response to shifts in public discourse
and political reality, such as the emergence of controversy over
'political correctness' (Fairclough 2003). We have argued that [[the
**primary focus** of critical analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} in CDA
[[should b]{.mark}e **practical argumentation** and
**deliberation**]{.underline} (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012). This was
based upon a claim about the character of political discourse, which we
saw as [primarily [concerned with ]{.mark}]{.underline}the question of
[**[what is to be done]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Deliberation is an
abstract genre in which **(alternative) proposals are being tested**.
The **framework**]{.underline} for critical analysis [of **practical
argumentation** and **deliberation**]{.underline} which we have
developed since 2012 [provides]{.underline} CDA with [an **effective way
of evaluating** and **critiquing discourse** from an **ethical point of
view**]{.underline}. One of its strengths is that [it allows **different
approaches** to thinking about ethical questions]{.underline}
(deontological, consequentialist and virtue ethics) [to be combined
within an **ethical deliberative procedure for achieving
impartiality**]{.underline}. In a more recent version of this framework
(Fairclough, I. 2016, 2018), [deliberation is modelled as a critical
procedure designed to **filter out**]{.underline} those **[practical
conclusions]{.underline}** (and corresponding decisions) [that **would
not pass the test of critical questioning**]{.underline}. Two distinct
argument schemes are involved in deliberative activity types: an
argument from goals, circumstances and meansgoal relations, and an
argument from (negative or positive) consequences. [[Proposals
are]{.mark} **tentatively supported** by **practical arguments from
goals**, and are **[tested in the light of their potential
consequences]{.mark}**, via **practical arguments from
consequence**]{.underline}. Goals are generated by various sources of
normativity, and these can be what conventionally is called 'values',
but can also be obligations, rights and duties. [Critical questioning
seeks to **expose potential negative consequences** of proposals and
thus evaluate them in terms of their **acceptability** or
**reasonableness**: if the consequences are **on balance unacceptable**
for those affected, then it would be **more reasonable not to engage in
the proposed course of action**. Unacceptable consequences are
**critical objections** which can **conclusively rebut a proposal**.
Where two or more proposals survive critical testing, one may be
**chosen as the better proposal** on nonarbitrary grounds]{.underline}
(e.g. being simpler to enact). In our view, [the **most significant
perspective** in the light of which proposals are to be tested is a
**consequentialist** one]{.underline} (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012,
Fairclough, I. 2016). The term 'consequence' is however used here
broadly to refer to several types of states-of-affairs: the goals of the
proposed action (the intended consequences); the potential unintended
consequences (or risks) involved; various known and predictable impacts,
including impacts on institutional, social facts. [If a proposal is
**likely to result in a situation** that is]{.underline} illegal or
[**unjust**, then the proposal can be **evaluated as unacceptable** from
both a **consequentialist ethics** and a **deontological ethical
position**. [Our framework can]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore
**[[accommodate]{.underline}]{.mark}** deontological [[**ethical
issues** within a]{.mark}]{.underline} broader **[[consequentialist
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By inquiring into the motives of
action, the framework can also accommodate a virtue-ethical perspective.

### 2AC -- Scenario Planning 

#### IR Scenario analysis unlocks an [intellectual openness]{.underline} to overcome [cognitive biases]{.underline} and incorporate [complementary theories]{.underline} while making research policy-relevant 

**Sus 20**---Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hertie School of Governance and
works in the Dahrendorf Forum, which is a joint initiative by the Hertie
School, the London School of Economics and Political Science, and
Stiftung Mercator \[Monika Sus and Marcel Hadeed (Dahrendorf Research

analysis for international relations", Contemporary Security Policy,
Accessed through the Wake Forest Library\]

Added-**[value of [scenario analysis for IR
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order [to [**fill the gap**
between]{.mark} **IR [theory]{.mark}** [and **real**]{.mark}**-world
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, "an increasing number of
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} have come to [[embrace]{.mark} a spirit
of [**intellectual openness**, recognizing]{.mark} both the need for
[**greater flexibility** in]{.mark} the [**theoretical formulations**
and]{.mark} the [**possibility of complementarity** by **other
theories**]{.mark} and approaches"]{.underline} (p. 12).
[This]{.underline} section discusses the [added value of scenario
analysis as a **complementary approach** to **traditional IR
methods**.]{.underline} The [most obvious [advantage of **scenario
analysis**]{.mark} **as a methodology**]{.underline}, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, [[lies]{.underline}]{.mark} by
definition [[in its ability to **tackle future
events**.]{.underline}]{.mark} As mentioned before, [there are no
specified instruments within traditional IR methods which would allow
scholars to go beyond past and present.]{.underline} The only exception
is forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which is, however,
distinctly different from foresight.

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. Foresight, as described above, aims at going beyond
existing patterns by developing alternative futures based on an
innovative combination of multiple driving forces. Its goal is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from them by examining the
causal relations between driving forces and their different evolutions.
By applying scenario approaches, scholars can thus account for evolving
dynamics and discuss such timely issues as the consequences of Brexit
for both British and EU-security, economics and politics (Brakman,
Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018; Musolff, 2017;
Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, [scenario analysis offers
more than the possibility to talk about the future.]{.underline} We see
a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods
applied by IR scholars.

Confronting enduring assumptions

As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of
[explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this
paper, is to [**stimulate creative thinking** by **challenging** the
**deeply held assumptions of their authors**.]{.underline} In other
words, [[this method]{.mark} is helpful for **[overcom]{.mark}ing**
enduring **[cognitive biases]{.mark}**---mental errors [such as
**linearity**]{.mark}, **presentism**, [and **group think** caused by
the **subconscious**]{.mark} and **simplified information processing of
humans**]{.underline} (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111-- 112). [Humans have the
tendencies to focus on the present at the expense of the future and to
think about the future in linear terms by extrapolating past trends into
the future.]{.underline} As Gaddis (1992) points out, "we tend to bias
our historical and our theoretical analyses too much toward continuity
(...) [we rarely]{.underline} find a way to [introduce **discontinuities
into theory**]{.underline}, [or to attempt to determine what causes them
to happen]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if Gaddis does not explicitly
mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts underlying scenario
approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis attends to
"**deeper**, otherwise left **implicit**, **assumptions** about
**continuous** and **linear patterns of development**"]{.underline}
(Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The [**[process]{.mark} of scenario
development** [invites]{.mark} the [participants to **reveal** and
**question convictions** which]{.mark} have **so far [remained
unchallenged]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} to **[question]{.mark} the
[linearity of]{.mark} world
[developments]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [ability of **reexamining one's own assumptions** and going **beyond
linear patterns** of development is **essential** for **IR
scholarship**.]{.underline} To illustrate it with two examples: IR
scholars and historians did not think that the Soviet Union could
collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful resolution of the
Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system (Davis, 2005;
Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars were for
decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and cultural
limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden ascent and
were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson,
2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident, the United
States debate on its future has been marked by a similar linearity of
thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's long-term
future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved incapable of
anticipating events of such importance, because scholars took for
granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias towards
linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a result, two
major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and the rise of
China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to catch up.

Against this backdrop, [[foresight helps]{.mark} IR [scholars]{.mark} to
**[exit]{.mark}** the [**tunnel vision** on]{.mark} world
[affairs]{.mark} and discover potentially valuable nonlinear lines of
development. [These can be]{.mark} both [**innovative** in]{.mark} terms
of [**scholarship**, and **policy-relevant**]{.mark} by [offering a
**reflection**]{.mark} on **unexpected discontinuities**.]{.underline}
Thus, [it can facilitate the **intellectual capability** [to **think the
unthinkable**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Porter, 2016, p. 259).

Bringing forward new research questions

[Scenario analysis starts with **confronting one's enduring
assumptions** and **developing multiple causal possibilities**, through
which scholars can potentially discover topics that have not been
examined before. One of the greatest challenges for any scholar is to
identify innovative venues for research that might bring the discipline
forward]{.underline} and advance publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian
terms, such an ability is often considered an evidence of a progressive
research program.10 [Since the prime feature of scenario analysis is to
**detect rapid and significant shifts** in **trajectories**, or the
**forces behind them**, this method succors]{.underline} when defining
new pressing topics for academia. In particular, as mentioned in the
previous section, scenario analysis enables the detection of both weak
signals and wild cards. By drawing attention to these hitherto
overlooked but potentially pressing issues, [scenario analysis can
identify research agendas for **further investigation**]{.underline}
(Barma et al., 2016). Therefore, [scenario analysis seems to be the
right tool to **advance innovative research** since it helps scholars
**drive their research into new areas**, away from moribund topics that
have been followed for many decades.]{.underline} By "identifying
questions of likely future significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6),
scenario analysis can contribute to combatting the proliferation of
researchers in fields occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet
or Japan studies in the United States in the 1980s. At the same time,
[[innovative research]{.mark} topics **[confront]{.mark} the
[uncertainties]{.mark}** [that are **crucial for policymakers**
to]{.mark} be [monitor]{.mark}ed closely.]{.underline}

Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world issues

[Another added value of the scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in
its ability to provide **comprehensive causal reasoning** and thus to
**tackle complex issues**.]{.underline} As mentioned in the
introduction, [the **world's complexity** combined with **abrupt
shifts** poses a challenge for IR scholarship.]{.underline} The
[[possibility to **accommodate multiple driving forces**, to **take into
account different values**]{.mark} they might take [and]{.mark} finally
to **[combine them]{.mark} with each other** [and **see how they affect
the**]{.mark} **dependent [variable]{.mark}**, [makes]{.mark} the
[scenario approach]{.mark} quite [unique]{.mark}. Traditional IR methods
work with a limited number of independent variables]{.underline},
formulate and test hypotheses usually based on the relation between a
single causal variable and the dependent variable. Investigating complex
causal trajectories is therefore not possible. Against this background,
we agree with Barma et al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that
[**scenarios are highly apt** for **dealing with complexity** and
**uncertainty** and [providing]{.mark} academia with [a tool for
"**actionable clarity** in **understanding**]{.mark} **contemporary
global [issues]{.mark}**["]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 1).

Moreover, the scenario approach helps to tackle the challenges of
interdisciplinarity that is tied to complexity. By drawing on the active
participation of people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and
with different expertise in the scenario development process, it brings
interdisciplinarity to the table by default. The key advantage of the
approach is that this [interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior
to and during the research phase, rather than after it.]{.underline}
This distinguishes the scenario approach from other methods that bring
interdisciplinary perspectives together but do not facilitate a
discussion between them, rather letting them passively co-exist. By
exploring the dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change
(key drivers), [scenario analysis can be useful for shedding light on
developments that would have been overlooked by narrower research
designs. In **security studies**]{.underline}, for example, [scenario
analysis can **connect the dots** between hard, soft, traditional and
non-traditional understandings of security and capture the **interplay
of economic-societalenvironmental** and **technological changes**.
Imposing interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also [helps to **counter** the
"**hyper-fragmentation of knowledge**" that "makes it difficult for even
scholars in different disciplines to understand each other, much less
policy-makers and general public"]{.underline} (Desch, 2015, p. 381).

[Complex real-world issues]{.underline} that were [tackled using
scenario analysis include the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}
(Stein et al., 1998), [Turkey's geopolitical environment]{.underline}
(Çelik & Blum, 2007), the [prospects of the United States-- China
conflict]{.underline} (Friedberg, 2005) [and the consequences of Brexit
for EU foreign and security policy]{.underline} (Martill & Sus, 2018).
An examination of these topics without the application of
interdisciplinary approaches would not be possible precisely due to
their multifaceted character.

Stepping out of the ivory tower

Finally, [scenario analysis]{.underline} also [enables **IR scholars**
to **establish** a **channel of communication with
policy-makers**]{.underline} other than conducting interviews for their
own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. [A participatory
scenario process forges "**deep and shared understanding** between its
participants"]{.underline} (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, [academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures.]{.underline}
Hence, [[scenario analysis can be]{.mark} perceived as [a tool towards
**more exchange between academia and policy-making** that]{.mark} can
[contribute to a **better understanding between the two**]{.mark}
worlds. For policymakers, it provides the opportunity [to consider
**long-term trends**]{.mark}]{.underline} (an occasion not often found
in the day-to-day nature of politics). [For academics, it provides
insight into which trends are most concerning for policy-makers,
allowing them to check [and]{.mark} ultimately [enhance]{.mark} the
**[relevance of]{.mark} their [research
agendas]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We acknowledge the difficulty to engage policy-makers in foresight
exercises caused by their time-constrains and possible lack of interest.
Yet, in our experience, this problem mostly refers to high-level
policy-makers. Mid-level and former officials and policy-makers have
more time and willingness to participate in foresight exercises and
contribute equally valuable perspectives. The participatory character of
foresight exercises facilitates the exchange of views from different
stakeholders on an equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has
shown, it has proven to be stimulating for each of the engaged groups.

Moreover, the [**policy dialogue** benefits from **scenarios'
accessibility** to a **broader audience**. Scenario publications tend to
be shorter and easier to read than the average academic
publication]{.underline} and as Nye (2008) rightly notes "a premium on
time is a major difference between the two cultures" of academia and
policy-making. Since [scenario publications are **more suitable** to the
**time- and attention-constraints** of many policy-makers, they improve
the accessibility of research findings for the policy world]{.underline}
(Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An illustrative example is offered by a
foresight exercise conducted by the Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A
group of academics, think tank experts and policy-makers developed
scenarios on the future of the liberal world order that served as raw
material for a newspaper from the future titled "The Aspen Insight" and
dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the presentation of the newspaper
catch the attention of many Berlin-based policy-makers but the "The
Aspen Insight" was also attached as a supplement to the Berlin daily
Tagesspiegel, and reached more than 300,000 readers.11

We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added value of [scenario
analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline} are interrelated and that their
boundaries are not clear-cut. Yet, we believe, they [highlight distinct
benefits]{.underline} of this approach [for academics that want to
**tackle the challenges of today's world via their
research**.]{.underline}

#### Scenario analysis is pedagogically valuable -- enhances creativity and self-reflexivity, deconstructs cognitive biases and flawed ontological assumptions, and enables the imagination and creation of alternative futures.

[Over the past decade, [the "cult of irrelevance"]{.mark} in political
science]{.underline} scholarship [[has been lamented by a growing
chorus]{.underline}]{.mark} (Putnam 2003; Nye 2009; Walt 2009).
[[Prominent scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} of international affairs
[[have diagnosed]{.underline}]{.mark} the roots of [[the
gap]{.underline}]{.mark} between academia and policymaking, [[made the
case for why]{.underline}]{.mark} political science [[research is
valuable for policymaking]{.underline}, [and
offered]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of [ideas]{.underline} for
enhancing the policy relevance of scholarship in international relations
and comparative politics (Walt 2005,2011; Mead 2010; Van Evera 2010;
Jentleson and Ratner 2011; Gallucci 2012; Avey and Desch 2014). Building
on these insights, [[several initiatives]{.mark} have been
formed]{.underline} in the attempt to "bridge the gap."2
[Many]{.underline} of the specific efforts put in place by these
projects [focus on providing scholars with the skills, platforms, and
networks to better communicate]{.underline} the [findings and
implications]{.underline} of their research [to the policymaking
community]{.underline}, a necessary and worthwhile objective for a field
in which theoretical debates, methodological training, and publishing
norms tend more and more toward the abstract and esoteric.¶ [[Yet
enhancing communication]{.underline}]{.mark} between scholars and
policymakers [[is only one component]{.underline}]{.mark} of bridging
the gap between international affairs theory and practice.
[[Anothe]{.mark}r]{.underline} crucial component of this bridge [[is the
**generation of substantive research programs that are actually policy
relevant**]{.underline}]{.mark}---a challenge to which less concerted
attention has been paid. The dual challenges of bridging the gap are
especially acute for graduate students, a particular irony since many
enter the discipline with the explicit hope of informing policy. [In a
field that has an admirable devotion to pedagogical
self-reflection]{.underline}, [**[strikingly little attention is paid to
techniques for generating policy-relevant ideas]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[for]{.underline} dissertation and other [research topics]{.underline}.
Although numerous articles and conference workshops are devoted to the
importance of experiential and problem-based learning, especially
through techniques of simulation that emulate policymaking processes
(Loggins 2009; Butcher 2012; Glasgow 2012; Rothman 2012; DiCicco 2014),
little has been written about the use of such techniques for generating
and developing innovative research ideas.¶ [This article outlines an
experiential and problem-based approach to]{.underline} developing a
[political science research]{.underline} program [using scenario
analysis]{.underline}. It focuses especially on illuminating the
research generation and pedagogical benefits of this technique by
describing the use of scenarios in the annual New Era Foreign Policy
Conference (NEFPC), which brings together doctoral students of
international and comparative affairs who share a demonstrated interest
in policy-relevant scholarship.3 In the introductory section, the
article outlines the practice of scenario analysis and considers the
utility of the technique in political science. We argue that scenario
analysis should be viewed as a tool to stimulate problem-based learning
for doctoral students and discuss the broader scholarly benefits of
using scenarios to help generate research ideas. The second section
details the manner in which NEFPC deploys scenario analysis. The third
section reflects upon some of the concrete scholarly benefits that have
been realized from the scenario format. The fourth section offers
insights on the pedagogical potential associated with using scenarios in
the classroom across levels of study. A brief conclusion reflects on the
importance of developing specific techniques to aid those who wish to
generate political science scholarship of relevance to the policy
world.¶ What Are Scenarios and Why Use Them in Political Science?¶
[Scenario analysis]{.underline} is perceived most commonly as a
technique for examining the robustness of strategy. It [can immerse
decision makers in future states that go beyond conventional
extrapolations of current trends]{.underline}, [preparing them to take
advantage of unexpected opportunities and to protect themselves from
adverse exogenous shocks]{.underline}. The global petroleum company
Shell, a pioneer of the technique, characterizes scenario analysis as
the art of considering "what if" questions about possible future worlds.
[[Scenario analysis is]{.mark} thus **[typically seen as serving the
purposes of corporate planning or as a policy
tool]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}to be used in combination with
simulations of decision making. **[Yet scenario analysis [is not
inherently limited to these uses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This
section]{.underline} provides a brief overview of the practice of
scenario analysis and the motivations underpinning its uses. It then
[makes a case for the utility of the technique for political science
scholarship]{.underline} and describes how the scenarios deployed at
NEFPC were created.¶ The Art of Scenario Analysis¶ [We characterize
[scenario analysis]{.mark} as [the art of juxtaposing current trends in
unexpected combinations in order to **articulate surprising and yet
plausible futures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, often **[referred to as
"alternative worlds."]{.underline}** [[Scenarios
a]{.mark}re]{.underline} thus **[explicitly not forecasts or projections
based on linear extrapolations of contemporary patterns]{.underline}**,
[and they are **[not hypothesis-based expert
predictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Nor should they be equated with
simulation]{.underline}**]{.mark}[**s**, which are]{.underline} best
characterized as [functional representations of **real institutions** or
decision-making processes]{.underline} (Asal 2005). **[Instead, [they
are depictions of possible future states of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**, offered **[together with a narrative of
the driving causal forces]{.underline}** and potential exogenous shocks
**[that could lead to those futures]{.underline}**. Good scenarios thus
rely on explicit causal propositions that, independent of one another,
are plausible---yet, when combined, suggest surprising and sometimes
controversial future worlds. For example, few predicted the dramatic
fall in oil prices toward the end of 2014. Yet independent driving
forces, such as the shale gas revolution in the United States, China's
slowing economic growth, and declining conflict in major Middle Eastern
oil producers such as Libya, were all recognized secular trends
that---combined with OPEC's decision not to take concerted action as
prices began to decline---came together in an unexpected way.¶ While
scenario analysis played a role in war gaming and strategic planning
during the Cold War, the real antecedents of the contemporary practice
are found in corporate futures studies of the late 1960s and early 1970s
(Raskin et al. 2005). Scenario analysis was essentially initiated at
Royal Dutch Shell in 1965, with the realization that the usual
forecasting techniques and models were not capturing the rapidly
changing environment in which the company operated (Wack 1985; Schwartz
1991). In particular, it had become evident that straight-line
extrapolations of past global trends were inadequate for anticipating
the evolving business environment. Shell-style scenario planning "helped
break the habit, ingrained in most corporate planning, of assuming that
the future will look much like the present" (Wilkinson and Kupers 2013,
4). Using scenario thinking, Shell anticipated the possibility of two
Arab-induced oil shocks in the 1970s and hence was able to position
itself for major disruptions in the global petroleum sector.¶ Building
on its corporate roots, scenario analysis has become a standard
policymaking tool. For example, the Project on Forward Engagement
advocates linking systematic foresight, which it defines as the
disciplined analysis of alternative futures, to planning and feedback
loops to better equip the United States to meet contemporary governance
challenges (Fuerth 2011). Another prominent application of scenario
thinking is found in the National Intelligence Council's series of
Global Trends reports, issued every four years to aid policymakers in
anticipating and planning for future challenges. These reports present a
handful of "alternative worlds" approximately twenty years into the
future, carefully constructed on the basis of emerging global trends,
risks, and opportunities, and intended to stimulate thinking about
geopolitical change and its effects.4 As with corporate scenario
analysis, the technique can be used in foreign policymaking for
long-range general planning purposes as well as for anticipating and
coping with more narrow and immediate challenges. An example of the
latter is the German Marshall Fund's EuroFutures project, which uses
four scenarios to map the potential consequences of the Euro-area
financial crisis (German Marshall Fund 2013).¶ [[Several features make
scenario analysis particularly useful for
policymak]{.mark}ing]{.underline}.5 [Long-term global trends across a
number of different realms]{.underline}---social, technological,
environmental, economic, and political---[combine in often-unexpected
ways to produce unforeseen challenges]{.underline}. [Yet [the ability of
decision makers to imagine, let alone prepare for,
discontinuities]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in the policy realm [[is
constrained by their existing mental models and
maps]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This limitation is [exacerbated by]{.mark}
**well-known cognitive bias tendencies such as [groupthink and
confirmation bias]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}(Jervis 1976; Janis
1982; Tetlock 2005). [[The power of scenarios lies in their ability to
help individuals **break out of conventional modes of thinking**]{.mark}
and analysis by introducing unusual combinations of trends and
deliberate discontinuities in narratives about the future]{.underline}.
**[Imagining alternative future worlds through a structured analytical
process enables policymakers to envision and thereby adapt to something
altogether different from the known present]{.underline}**.¶ Designing
Scenarios for Political Science Inquiry¶ The characteristics of scenario
analysis that commend its use to policymakers also make it well suited
to helping political scientists generate and develop policy-relevant
research programs. [Scenarios are essentially textured, plausible, and
relevant stories that help us imagine how the future]{.underline}
political-economic world [could be different from the past]{.underline}
in a manner that highlights policy challenges and opportunities. For
example, terrorist organizations are a known threat that have captured
the attention of the policy community, yet our responses to them tend to
be linear and reactive. Scenarios that explore how seemingly unrelated
vectors of change---the rise of a new peer competitor in the East that
diverts strategic attention, volatile commodity prices that empower and
disempower various state and nonstate actors in surprising ways, and the
destabilizing effects of climate change or infectious disease
pandemics---can be useful for illuminating the nature and limits of the
terrorist threat in ways that may be missed by a narrower focus on
recognized states and groups. By illuminating the potential strategic
significance of specific and yet poorly understood opportunities and
threats, scenario analysis helps to identify crucial gaps in our
collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends and
dynamics. The notion of "exogeneity"---so prevalent in social science
scholarship---applies to models of reality, not to reality itself. [Very
simply, scenario analysis can throw into sharp relief often-overlooked
yet pressing questions in international affairs that demand focused
investigation]{.underline}.¶ [Scenarios thus offer]{.underline}, in
principle, [an innovative tool for developing a political science
research agenda]{.underline}. In practice, [achieving this objective
requires careful tailoring of the approach]{.underline}. The specific
scenario analysis technique we outline below was designed and refined to
provide a structured experiential process for generating problem-based
research questions with contemporary international policy relevance.6
The first step in the process of creating the scenario set described
here was to identify important causal forces in contemporary global
affairs. Consensus was not the goal; on the contrary, some of these
causal statements represented competing theories about global change
(e.g., a resurgence of the nation-state vs. border-evading globalizing
forces). A major principle underpinning the transformation of these
causal drivers into possible future worlds was to "simplify, then
exaggerate" them, before fleshing out the emerging story with more
details.7 Thus, the contours of the future world were drawn first in the
scenario, with details about the possible pathways to that point filled
in second. It is entirely possible, indeed probable, that some of the
causal claims that turned into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so
much as to be implausible, and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our
own form of groupthink went into construction of the scenarios. One of
the great strengths of scenario analysis, however, is that the scenario
discussions themselves, as described below, lay bare these especially
implausible claims and systematic biases.8¶ An explicit methodological
approach underlies the written scenarios themselves as well as the
analytical process around them---that of case-centered, structured,
focused comparison, intended especially to shed light on new causal
mechanisms (George and Bennett 2005). [The use of scenarios is similar
to counterfactual analysis in that it modifies certain variables in a
given situation in order to analyze the resulting effects]{.underline}
(Fearon 1991). [Whereas counterfactuals are traditionally
retrospective]{.underline} in nature and explore events that did not
actually occur in the context of known history, our [**[scenarios are
deliberately forward-looking]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
are [designed to **explore potential futures**]{.underline} that could
unfold. As such, counterfactual analysis is especially well suited to
identifying how individual events might expand or shift the "funnel of
choices" available to political actors and thus lead to different
historical outcomes (Nye 2005, 68--69), while forward-looking scenario
analysis can better illuminate surprising intersections and
sociopolitical dynamics without the perceptual constraints imposed by
fine-grained historical knowledge. [We see scenarios as a complementary
resource for exploring these dynamics in international affairs, rather
than as a replacement]{.underline} for counterfactual analysis,
historical case studies, or other methodological tools.¶ In the scenario
process developed for NEFPC, three distinct scenarios are employed,
acting as cases for analytical comparison. Each scenario, as detailed
below, includes a set of explicit "driving forces" which represent
hypotheses about causal mechanisms worth investigating in evolving
international affairs. The scenario analysis process itself employs
templates (discussed further below) to serve as a graphical
representation of a structured, focused investigation and thereby as the
research tool for conducting case-centered comparative analysis (George
and Bennett 2005). In essence, these templates articulate key observable
implications within the alternative worlds of the scenarios and serve as
a framework for capturing the data that emerge (King, Keohane, and Verba
1994). Finally, this structured, focused comparison serves as the basis
for the cross-case session emerging from the scenario analysis that
leads directly to the articulation of new research agendas.¶ [The
scenario process described here has thus been carefully designed to
offer some guidance to policy-oriented]{.underline} graduate [students
who are otherwise left to the relatively unstructured norms by which
political science]{.underline} dissertation [ideas are typically
developed]{.underline}. The initial articulation of a dissertation
project is generally an idiosyncratic and personal undertaking (Useem
1997; Rothman 2008), whereby students might choose topics based on their
coursework, their own previous policy exposure, or the topics studied by
their advisors. Research agendas are thus typically developed by looking
for "puzzles" in existing research programs (Kuhn 1996). Doctoral
students also, understandably, often choose topics that are particularly
amenable to garnering research funding. Conventional grant programs
typically base their funding priorities on extrapolations from what has
been important in the recent past---leading to, for example, the
prevalence of Japan and Soviet studies in the mid-1980s or terrorism
studies in the 2000s---in the absence of any alternative method for
identifying questions of likely future significance.¶ [The scenario
approach to generating research ideas is grounded in the belief that
these traditional approaches can be complemented by identifying
questions likely to be of great empirical importance in the real world,
even if these **do not appear**]{.underline} as puzzles [**in existing
research programs** or as clear extrapolations from past
events]{.underline}. The [[scenario]{.mark}s]{.underline} analyzed at
NEFPC [envision alternative worlds that could develop in the medium
(five to seven year) term and are designed to **[tease out issues
scholars and policymakers may encounter in the relatively near
future]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[so that they can **begin thinking
critically about them now**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [This timeframe offers
a period distant enough from the present as to avoid falling into
current events analysis, but not so far into the future as to seem like
science fiction]{.underline}. In imagining the worlds in which these
scenarios might come to pass, [[participants **learn strategies for
avoiding failures of creativity** and for **overturning the assumptions
that prevent scholars and analysts from anticipating and understanding**
the pivotal junctures that arise in international
affairs]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[This article introduces]{.underline} political scientists to
[scenarios]{.underline}---future counterfactuals---[and demonstrates
their value]{.underline} in tandem [with other methodologies and across
a]{.underline} wide [range of research]{.underline} questions. The

at which scenarios are used in the international relations subfield and
situates scenarios in the broader context of political science methods.
The conclusion offers two detailed examples of the effective use of
scenarios. In his classic work on scenario and Duncan 1993; Leufkens,

tool** employed by]{.underline} the [policymakers]{.underline} whom
political scientists study. [This]{.underline} article [seeks to elevate
the status of scenarios in political science by
demonstrating]{.underline} their [usefulness for theory building and

argument is developed in favor of the use of scenarios. The article

new **[[empirical research]{.underline}]{.mark}** programs. Scenarios in
the Discipline What do counterfactual narratives about the future look
like? Scenarios may range in length from a few sentences to many pages.
One of [[the most common uses]{.mark} of]{.underline} the
[scenario]{.underline} method, which will be referenced throughout this
article, [[is to study]{.mark} the conditions under which
**[high-consequence, low-probability]{.mark}** events]{.underline} may
[occur]{.underline}. Perhaps [the best example]{.underline} of this [is
**nuclear [warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a circumstance that has never
resulted, but has captivated generations of political scientists. For an
introductory illustration, let us consider a very simple scenario
regarding how a first use of a nuclear weapon might occur: During the
year 2023, the US military is ordered to launch air and sea patrols of
the Taiwan Strait to aid in a crisis. These highly visible patrols
disrupt trade off China\'s coast, and result in skyrocketing insurance
rates for shipping companies. Several days into the contingency, which
involves over ten thousand US military personnel, an intelligence
estimate concludes that a Chinese conventional strike against US air
patrols and naval assets is imminent. The United States conducts a
preemptive strike against anti-air and anti-sea systems on the Chinese
mainland. The US strike is far more successful than Chinese military
leaders thought possible; a new source of intelligence to the United
States---unknown to Chinese leadership---allowed the US military to
severely degrade Chinese targeting and situational awareness
capabilities. Many of the weapons that China relied on to dissuade
escalatory US military action are now reduced to single-digit-percentage
readiness. Estimates for repairs and replenishments are stated in terms
of weeks, and China\'s confidence in readily available, but "dumber,"
weapons is low due to the dispersion and mobility of US forces. Word of
the successful US strike spreads among the Chinese and Taiwanese
publics. The Chinese Government concludes that for the sake of
preserving its domestic strength, and to signal resolve to the US and
Taiwanese Governments while minimizing further economic disruption, it
should escalate dramatically with the use of an extremely small-yield
nuclear device against a stationary US military asset in the Pacific
region. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} short story [[reflects]{.mark} a

### 2AC -- Extinction First 

#### The aff outweighs -- extinction is the upmost moral evil and disavowal of the risk makes it more likely

Many, though certainly not all, people might believe that it would be
wrong to bring about the end of the human species, and the reasons given
for this belief are various. I begin by considering four reasons that
could be given against the moral permissibility of human extinction. I
will argue that only those reasons that impact the people who exist at
the time that the extinction or the knowledge of the upcoming extinction
occurs, can explain its wrongness. I use this conclusion to then
consider in which cases human extinction would be morally permissible or
impermissible, arguing that there is only a small class of cases in
which it would not be wrong to cause the
[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark} of the human race or allow it to
happen. 2.1. It [would [prevent]{.mark} the [existence]{.mark} of very
many]{.underline} happy [people]{.underline} One reason of human
extinction might be considered to be wrong lies in the value of human
life itself. The thought here might be that [[it is]{.mark} a
[good]{.mark} thing [for people to exist]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}and enjoy happy lives [[and extinction would deprive]{.mark}
more [people of]{.mark} enjoying [this]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}good. [The 'good]{.underline}' in this case [could be
understood in]{.underline} at least [two ways.]{.underline} According to
the [first]{.underline}, one might believe that you benefit a person by
bringing them into existence, or at least, that [it is good for that
person that they come to exist]{.underline}. The second view might hold
that [if humans were to go extinct]{.underline}, [the utility
[foregone]{.mark} by the [billions]{.mark} (or more) of people who could
have lived but [will]{.mark} now [never get that
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}, renders allowing human extinction to
take place an incidence of wrongdoing. An example of this view can be
found in two quotes from an Effective Altruism blog post by Peter
Singer, Nick Beckstead and Matt Wage: One very bad thing about human
extinction would be that **[[billions of people would]{.mark} likely
[die painful deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But in our view, this is by
far not the worst thing about human extinction. [The worst thing about
human extinction is that [there would be no future
generations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since there could be so many
generations in our future, **[[the value of all those generations
together greatly exceeds the value of the current
generation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. (Beckstead, Singer, and Wage 2013)
The authors are making two claims. The first is that [there is value in
human life and]{.underline} also [something valuable about creating
future people]{.underline} which gives us a reason to do so;
furthermore, it would be a very bad thing if we did not do so. The
second is that, not only would it be a bad thing for there to be no
future people, but it would actually be the worst thing about
extinction. Since happy human lives have value, and the number of
potential people who could ever exist is far greater than the number of
people who exist at any one time, even if the extinction were brought
about through the painful deaths of currently existing people, the
former's loss would be greater than the latter's. Both claims are
assuming that there is an intrinsic value in the existence of potential
human life. The second claim makes the further assumption that the
forgone value of the potential lives that could be lived is greater than
the disvalue that would be accrued by people existing at the time of the
extinction through suffering from painful and/or premature deaths. The
best-known author of the post, Peter Singer is a prominent utilitarian,
so it is not surprising that he would lament the potential lack of
future human lives per se. However, it is not just utilitarians who
share this view, even if implicitly. Indeed, other philosophers also
seem to imply that they share the intuition that there is just something
wrong with causing or failing to prevent the extinction of the human
species such that we prevent more 'people' from having the 'opportunity
to exist'. Stephen Gardiner (2009) and Martin O'Neill (personal
correspondence), both sympathetic to contract theory, for example, also
find it intuitive that we should want more generations to have the
opportunity to exist, assuming that they have worth-living lives, and I
find it plausible to think that many other people (philosophers and
non-philosophers alike) probably share this intuition. [When we talk
about [future lives being 'prevented']{.mark}, we are saying
that]{.underline} [a possible]{.underline} person or a [set]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} possible [people who could potentially have existed
will now never actually come to exist]{.underline}. To say that it is
wrong to prevent people from existing could either mean that a possible
person could reasonably reject a principle that permitted us not to
create them, or that the foregone value of their lives provides a reason
for rejecting any principle that permits extinction. To make the first
claim we would have to argue that a possible person could reasonably
reject any principle that prevented their existence on the grounds that
it prevented them in particular from existing. However, this is
implausible for two reasons. First, we can only wrong someone who did,
does or will actually exist because wronging involves failing to take a
person's interests into account. When considering the permissibility of
a principle allowing us not to create Person X, we cannot take X's
interest in being created into account because X will not exist if we
follow the principle. By considering the standpoint of a person in our
deliberations we consider the burdens they will have to bear as a result
of the principle. In this case, there is no one who will bear any
burdens since if the principle is followed (that is, if we do not create
X), X will not exist to bear any burdens. So, only people who do/will
actually exist can bear the brunt of a principle, and therefore occupy a
standpoint that is owed justification. Second, existence is not an
interest at all and a possible person is not disadvantaged by not being
caused to exist. Rather than being an interest, it is a necessary
requirement in order to have interests. Rivka Weinberg describes it as
'neutral' because causing a person to exist is to create a subject who
can have interests; existence is not an interest itself.3 In order to be
disadvantaged, there must be some detrimental effect on your interests.
However, without existence, a person does not have any interests so they
cannot be disadvantaged by being kept out of existence. But, as Weinberg
points out, 'never having interests itself could not be contrary to
people's interests since without interest bearers, there can be no
'they' for it to be bad for' (Weinberg 2008, 13). So, a principle that
results in some possible people never becoming actual does not impose
any costs on those 'people' because nobody is disadvantaged by not
coming into existence.4 It therefore seems that it cannot be wrong to
fail to bring particular people into existence. This would mean that no
one acts wrongly when they fail to create another person. Writ large, it
would also not be wrong if everybody decided to exercise their
prerogative not to create new people and potentially, by consequence,
allow human extinction. One might respond here by saying that although
it may be permissible for one person to fail to create a new person, it
is not permissible if everyone chooses to do so because human lives have
value and allowing human extinction would be to forgo a huge amount of
value in the world. This takes us to the second way of understanding the
potential wrongness of preventing people from existing --- the foregone
value of a life provides a reason for rejecting any principle that
prevents it. One possible reply to this claim turns on the fact that
many philosophers acknowledge that the only, or at least the best, way
to think about the value of (individual or groups of) possible people's
lives is in impersonal terms (Parfit 1984; Reiman 2007; McMahan 2009).
Jeff McMahan, for example, writes 'at the time of one's choice there is
no one who exists or will exist independently of that choice for whose
sake one could be acting in causing him or her to exist ... it seems
therefore that any reason to cause or not to cause an individual to
exist ... is best considered an impersonal rather than
individual-affecting reason' (McMahan 2009, 52). Another reply along
similar lines would be to appeal to the value that is lost or at least
foregone when we fail to bring into existence a next (or several next)
generations of people with worth-living lives. Since ex hypothesi
worth-living lives have positive value, it is better to create more such
lives and worse to create fewer. Human extinction by definition is the
creation of no future lives and would 'deprive' billions of 'people' of
the opportunity to live worth-living lives. This might reduce the amount
of value in the world at the time of the extinction (by killing already
existing people), but it would also prevent a much vaster amount of
value in the future (by failing to create more people). Both replies
depend on the impersonal value of human life. However, recall that in
contractualism impersonal values are not on their own grounds for
reasonably rejecting principles. Scanlon himself says that although we
have a strong reason not to destroy existing human lives, this reason
'does not flow from the thought that it is a good thing for there to be
more human life rather than less' (104). In contractualism, something
cannot be wrong unless there is an impact on a person. Thus, neither the
impersonal value of creating a particular person nor the impersonal
value of human life writ large could on its own provide a reason for
rejecting a principle permitting human extinction. It seems therefore
that the fact that extinction would deprive future people of the
opportunity to live worth-living lives (either by failing to create
either particular future people or future people in general) cannot
provide us with a reason to consider human extinction to be wrong.
Although the lost value of these 'lives' itself cannot be the reason
explaining the wrongness of extinction, it is possible the knowledge of
this loss might create a personal reason for some existing people. I
will consider this possibility later on in section (d). But first I move
to the second reason human extinction might be wrong per se. 2.2. **[[It
would mean the loss of the only known form of intelligent life]{.mark}
and all civilization and intellectual progress would be
lost]{.underline}** A second reason we might think it would be wrong to
cause human extinction is the loss that would occur of the only (known)
form of rational life and the knowledge and civilization that that form
of life has created. One thought here could be that just as some might
consider it wrong to destroy an individual human heritage monument like
the Sphinx, it would also be wrong if the advances made by humans over
the past few millennia were lost or prevented from progressing. A
related argument is made by those who feel that there is something
special about [[humans' capacity for rationality]{.underline}]{.mark}
which [[is valuable in itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since humans are the
only intelligent life that we know of, it would be a loss, in itself, to
the world for that to end. I admit that I struggle to fully appreciate
this thought. It seems to me that Henry Sidgwick was correct in thinking
that these things are only important insofar as they are important to
humans (Sidgwick 1874, I.IX.4).5 If there is no form of intelligent life
in the future, who would there be to lament its loss since intelligent
life is the only form of life capable of appreciating intelligence?
Similarly, if there is no one with the rational capacity to appreciate
historic monuments and civil progress, who would there be to be
negatively affected or even notice the loss?6 However, even if there is
nothing special about human rationality, just as some people try to
prevent the extinction of nonhuman animal species, we might think that
[we ought also to prevent human extinction for the sake of
biodiversity]{.underline}. The thought in this, as well as the earlier
examples, must be that it would somehow be bad for the world if there
were no more humans even though there would be no one for whom it is
bad. This may be so but the only way to understand this reason is
impersonally. Since we are concerned with wrongness rather than badness,
we must ask whether something that impacts no one's well-being, status
or claims can be wrong. As we saw earlier, in the contractualist
framework reasons must be personal rather than impersonal in order to
provide grounds for reasonable rejection (Scanlon 1998, 218--223). Since
the loss of civilization, intelligent life or biodiversity are per se
impersonal reasons, there is no standpoint from which these reasons
could be used to reasonably reject a principle that permitted
extinction. Therefore, causing human extinction on the grounds of the
loss of civilization, rational life or biodiversity would not be wrong.
2.3. **[[Existing people would endure physical pain and]{.mark}/or
[painful]{.mark} and/or [premature deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}Thinking about the ways in which human extinction might come
about brings to the fore two more reasons it might be wrong. It could,
for example, occur if all humans (or at least the critical number needed
to be unable to replenish the population, leading to eventual
extinction) underwent a sterilization procedure. Or perhaps it could
come about due to anthropogenic climate change or a massive asteroid
hitting the Earth and wiping out the species in the same way it did the
dinosaurs millions of years ago. [Each]{.underline} of these
[scenario]{.underline}s [would involve significant physical]{.underline}
[and/]{.underline}or [non-physical harms]{.underline} to existing people
and their interests. Physically, people might suffer premature and
possibly also painful deaths, for example. It is not hard to imagine
examples in which the process of [extinction could cause]{.underline}
[premature death]{.underline}. [A nuclear winter]{.underline} [that
killed everyone or even just every woman under the age of 50 is a clear
example of such a case]{.underline}. Obviously, some types of premature
death themselves cannot be reasons to reject a principle. Every person
dies eventually, sometimes earlier than the standard expected lifespan
due to accidents or causes like spontaneously occurring incurable
cancers. A cause such as disease is not a moral agent and therefore it
cannot be wrong if it unavoidably kills a person prematurely. Scanlon
says that the fact that a principle would reduce a person's well-being
gives that person a reason to reject the principle: 'components of
well-being figure prominently as grounds for reasonable rejection'
(Scanlon 1998, 214). However, it is not settled yet whether premature
death is a setback to well-being. Some philosophers hold that death is a
harm to the person who dies, whilst others argue that it is not.7 I will
argue, however, that regardless of who is correct in that debate, [being
caused to die prematurely can be reason to [reject a principle when it
fails to show respect to]{.mark} the [person as]{.mark} a [rational
agent]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scanlon says that recognizing others as
rational beings with interests involves seeing reason to preserve life
and prevent death: '[appreciating]{.underline} [the value of human life
is primarily a matter of]{.underline} [seeing human lives
as]{.underline} something [to be respected]{.underline}, where this
involves seeing reasons not to destroy them, reasons to protect them,
and reasons to want them to go well' (Scanlon 1998, 104). The 'respect
for life' in this case is a respect for the person living, not respect
for human life in the abstract. This means that we can sometimes fail to
protect human life without acting wrongfully if we still respect the
person living. Scanlon gives the example of a person who faces a life of
unending and extreme pain such that she wishes to end it by committing
suicide. Scanlon does not think that the suicidal person shows a lack of
respect for her own life by seeking to end it because the person whose
life it is has no reason to want it to go on. This is important to note
because it emphasizes the fact that the respect for human life is
person-affecting. It is not wrong to murder because of the impersonal
disvalue of death in general, but because [taking someone's life without
their permission shows disrespect to that person]{.underline}. This
supports its inclusion as a reason in the contractualist formula,
regardless of what side ends up winning the 'is death a harm?' debate
because even if death turns out not to harm the person who died, ending
their life without their consent shows disrespect to that person. A
person who could reject a principle permitting another to cause his or
her premature death presumably does not wish to die at that time, or in
that manner. Thus, **[if they are [killed without their consent]{.mark},
their [interests have not been taken into
account]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and they have a reason to reject the
principle that allowed their premature death.8 This is as true in the
case of death due to extinction as it is for death due to murder.
However, physical pain may also be caused to existing people without
killing them, but still resulting in human extinction. Imagine, for
example, surgically removing everyone's reproductive organs in order to
prevent the creation of any future people. Another example could be [a
nuclear bomb that did not kill anyone, but did painfully render them
infertile through illness or injury]{.underline}. These would be cases
in which physical pain (through surgery or bombs) was inflicted on
existing people and the extinction came about as a result of the painful
incident rather than through death. Furthermore, one could imagine a
situation in which a bomb (for example) killed enough people to cause
extinction, but some people remained alive, but in terrible pain from
injuries. It seems uncontroversial that the infliction of physical pain
could be a reason to reject a principle. Although Scanlon says that an
impact on well-being is not the only reason to reject principles, it
plays a significant role, and indeed, most principles are likely to be
rejected due to a negative impact on a person's well-being, physical or
otherwise. It may be queried here whether it is actually the
involuntariness of the pain that is grounds for reasonable rejection
rather than the physical pain itself because not all pain that a person
suffers is involuntary. One can imagine acts that can cause physical
pain that are not rejectable --- base jumping or life-saving or
improving surgery, for example. On the other hand, pushing someone off a
cliff or cutting him with a scalpel against his will are clearly
rejectable acts. The difference between the two cases is that in the
former, the person having the pain inflicted has consented to that pain
or risk of pain. My view is that they cannot be separated in these cases
and it is involuntary physical pain that is the grounds for reasonable
rejection. Thus, the fact that a principle would allow unwanted physical
harm gives a person who would be subjected to that harm a reason to
reject the principle. Of course the mere fact that a principle causes
involuntary physical harm or premature death is not sufficient to
declare that the principle is rejectable --- there might be
countervailing reasons. In the case of extinction, what countervailing
reasons might be offered in favour of the involuntary physical pain/
death-inducing harm? One such reason that might be offered is that
humans are a harm to the natural environment and that the world might be
a better place if there were no humans in it. It could be that humans
might rightfully be considered an all-things-considered hindrance to the
world rather than a benefit to it given the fact that we have been
largely responsible for the extinction of many species, pollution and,
most recently, climate change which have all negatively affected the
natural environment in ways we are only just beginning to understand.
Thus, the fact that human extinction would improve the natural
environment (or at least prevent it from degrading further), is a
countervailing reason in favour of extinction to be weighed against the
reasons held by humans who would experience physical pain or premature
death. However, the good of the environment as described above is by
definition not a personal reason. Just like the loss of rational life
and civilization, therefore, it cannot be a reason on its own when
determining what is wrong and countervail the strong personal reasons to
avoid pain/death that is held by the people who would suffer from it.9
Every person existing at the time of the extinction would have a reason
to reject that principle on the grounds of the physical pain they are
being forced to endure against their will that could not be
countervailed by impersonal considerations such as the negative impact
humans may have on the earth. Therefore, a principle that permitted
extinction to be accomplished in a way that caused involuntary physical
pain or premature death could quite clearly be rejectable by existing
people with no relevant countervailing reasons. This means that human
extinction that came about in this way would be wrong. There are of
course also additional reasons they could reject a similar principle
which I now turn to address in the next section. 2.4. **[[Existing
people could endure non-physical harms]{.underline}]{.mark}** I said
earlier than [the fact]{.underline} in itself that [there would not be
any future people]{.underline} is an impersonal reason and can therefore
not be a reason to reject a principle permitting extinction. However,
this impersonal reason [could give rise to a personal
reason]{.underline} that is admissible. So, the final important reason
people might think that human extinction would be wrong is that [[there
could be various]{.mark} deleterious [psychological
effects]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}that would be endured by existing
people having the knowledge that there would be no future generations.
[There are two main sources of this trauma]{.underline}, both arising
from the knowledge that there will be no more people. [The first relates
to individual people and the undesired negative effect on
well-being]{.underline} [that would be experienced by those who would
have wanted to have children]{.underline}. Whilst **[this is [by no
means universal]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[it is fair to say that a good
proportion of people feel a strong pull towards
reproduction]{.underline}** and having their lineage continue in some
way. Samuel Scheffler describes the pull towards reproduction as a
'desire for a personalized relationship with the future' (Scheffler
2012, 31). Reproducing is a widely held desire and the joys of
parenthood are ones that many people wish to experience. For these
people knowing that they would not have descendants (or that their
descendants will endure painful and/or premature deaths) could create a
sense of despair and pointlessness of life. Furthermore, the inability
to reproduce and have your own children because of a principle/policy
that prevents you (either through bans or physical interventions) would
be a significant infringement of what we consider to be a basic right to
control what happens to your body. For these reasons, knowing that you
will have no descendants could cause significant psychological traumas
or harms even if there were no associated physical harm. [The second is
a]{.underline} more general, [higher level [sense of
hopelessness]{.mark} or [despair]{.mark} that [there will be no more
humans and that your projects will end with
you]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Even those who did not feel a strong
desire to procreate themselves might feel a sense of hopelessness that
any projects or goals they have for the future would not be
fulfilled]{.underline}. Many of the projects and goals we work towards
during our lifetime are also at least partly future-oriented. Why bother
continuing the search for a cure for cancer if either it will not be
found within humans' lifetime, and/or there will be no future people to
benefit from it once it is found? Similar projects and goals that might
lose their meaning when confronted with extinction include politics,
artistic pursuits and even the type of philosophical work with which
this paper is concerned. Even more extreme, through the words of the
character Theo Faron, P.D. James says in his novel The Children of Men
that '[without the hope of posterity for our race]{.underline} if not
for ourselves, without the assurance that we being dead yet live, [all
pleasures of the mind and senses sometimes seem to me no more than
pathetic and crumbling defences shored up against our
ruins']{.underline} (James 2006, 9). Even if James' claim is a bit
hyperbolic and all pleasures would not actually be lost, I agree with
Scheffler in finding it not implausible that the knowledge that
extinction was coming and that there would be no more people would have
at least a general depressive effect on people's motivation and
confidence in the value of and joy in their activities (Scheffler 2012,
43). [Both sources of [psychological harm are personal reasons to
reject]{.mark} a [principle that permitted human
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Existing people could therefore
reasonably reject the principle for either of these reasons.
Psychological pain and the inability to pursue your personal projects,
goals, and aims, are all acceptable reasons for rejecting principles in
the contractualist framework. So too are infringements of rights and
entitlements that we accept as important for people's lives. These
psychological reasons, then, are also valid reasons to reject principles
that permitted or required human extinction.

In this argument, it seems that Parfit is assuming that the survivors of
a nuclear war that kills 99% of the population would eventually be able
to recover civilisation without long-term effect. As we have seen, this
may not be a safe assumption -- but for the purposes of this thought
experiment, the point stands. What makes [existential
catastrophes]{.underline} especially bad is that they [would "destroy
the future,"]{.underline} as another Oxford philosopher, Nick Bostrom,
puts it.66 [This future could]{.underline} potentially [be **extremely
long** and **full of flourishing**, and]{.underline} would therefore
[have **extremely large value**. In standard risk analysis]{.underline},
when working out how to respond to risk, [we [work out]{.mark} the
expected [value]{.mark}]{.underline} of risk reduction, [by weighing
**the probability**]{.underline} that [an action will prevent **an
adverse event** against **the severity** of the event.
Because]{.underline} the value of preventing [existential catastrophe is
**so vast**, **even [a tiny probability]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
prevention [[has **huge**]{.mark} **expected
[value]{.mark}**]{.underline}.67 Of course, there is persisting
reasonable disagreement about ethics and there are a number of ways one
might resist this conclusion.68 Therefore, it would be unjustified to be
overconfident in Parfit and Bostrom's argument. In some areas,
government policy does give significant weight to future generations.
For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear waste storage,
governments have considered timeframes of thousands, hundreds of
thousands, and even a million years.69 [Justifications]{.underline} for
this policy usually [appeal to principles of ***intergenerational
equity*** according to which **future generations** ought to get **as
much protection** as current generations]{.underline}.70 Similarly,
widely accepted norms of sustainable development require development
that meets the needs of the current generation without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs.71 However, when
it comes to **[[ex]{.mark}istential [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it
[would]{.underline} seem that we [[fail to live up to]{.mark} principles
of **intergenerational [equity]{.mark}**. Existential [catastrophe
would]{.mark} not only [give future gen]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} **less
than the current generations**; it would give them
***[nothing]{.mark}***]{.underline}. Indeed, [reducing existential
risk]{.underline} plausibly [has **a quite low cost** for us in
comparison with **the huge expected value** it has for future
generations. In spite of this, **relatively little** is done to reduce
existential risk]{.underline}. Unless we give up on [norms of
**intergenerational equity**]{.underline}, they [give us **a strong
case**]{.underline} for significantly increasing our efforts [to reduce
existential risks]{.underline}. 1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE
SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY In spite of the importance of [existential risk
reduction]{.underline}, it probably [receives **less attention** than is
warranted]{.underline}. As a result, concerted international cooperation
is required if we are to receive adequate protection from existential
risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be underinvested in
There are several reasons why existential risk reduction is likely to be
underinvested in. Firstly, it is *a global public good*. Economic theory
predicts that such goods tend to be underprovided. The benefits of
existential risk reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed around
the globe from the countries responsible for taking action.
Consequently, [a country which reduces **existential risk** gains **only
a small portion** of the benefits but bears **the full brunt of the
costs**. Countries]{.underline} thus [have **strong incentives** to free
ride]{.underline}, receiving the benefits of risk reduction without
contributing. As a result, too few do what is in the common interest.
Secondly, as already suggested above, [**existential risk reduction** is
**an *intergenerational* public good**]{.underline}: most of [the
benefits are enjoyed by **future generations** who have **no say** in
the political process]{.underline}. For these goods, [the [problem is
***temporal* free riding**]{.mark}: the current [gen]{.mark}eration
[enjoys]{.mark} **the benefits of [inaction]{.mark}** [while future
gen]{.mark}eration[s bear **the costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thirdly,
many existential risks, such as machine superintelligence, engineered
pandemics, and solar geoengineering, pose an unprecedented and uncertain
future threat. Consequently, it is hard to develop a satisfactory
governance regime for them: there are few existing governance
instruments which can be applied to these risks, and it is unclear what
shape new instruments should take. In this way, our position with regard
to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we faced when nuclear
weapons first became available. **[Cognitive
[biases]{.mark}]{.underline}** also [[lead people to underestimate
ex]{.mark}istential [risks]{.mark}. Since there have not been **any
catastrophes** of this magnitude, these risks are **not
salient**]{.underline} to politicians and the public.72 [[This
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an example of the misapplication of [**the
*[availability]{.mark} [heuristic]{.mark}***, a mental shortcut which
[assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[something is important]{.mark}
**only [if]{.mark}** it can be **readily
[recalled]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[Another cognitive
bias]{.underline}** affecting perceptions of existential risk [is
**[scope neglect]{.mark}**. In **a seminal 1992 study**, three groups
were asked how much they would]{.underline} be [willing to pay to save
2,000]{.underline}, 20,000 [or 200,000 birds]{.underline} from drowning
in uncovered oil ponds. The groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88,
respectively.73 In this case, [[the size of]{.mark} the
[benefits]{.mark} had [**little effect** on]{.mark} the scale of the
preferred [response]{.mark}. [People]{.mark} **become [numbed]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the effect of [saving lives when]{.mark} the [numbers get
**too large**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} 74 [Scope neglect is **a
particularly acute problem** for existential risk because the numbers at
stake are **so large**]{.underline}. Due to scope neglect,
[decision-makers]{.underline} are prone to [treat existential
risks]{.underline} in a [similar]{.underline} way [to
problems]{.underline} which are [less severe by]{.underline} many orders
of [magnitude]{.underline}. A wide range of other cognitive biases are
likely to affect the evaluation of existential risks.75

These [[government]{.underline}]{.mark} or quasi-government think tank
[**[simulations]{.mark}** often [provide]{.mark}]{.underline} very
similar [[**lessons** for]{.underline}]{.mark} high-level players as are
learned by **[[students]{.underline}]{.mark}** in educational
simulations. Government [[participants learn]{.mark} about [the
**importance** of]{.mark} **understanding [foreign
perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the need to practice internal
coordination, [[and the **necessity** to **compromise**]{.mark} **and
coordinate**]{.underline} with other governments in negotiations and
crises. During the Cold War, political scientist Robert Mandel noted how
**[crisis [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}** and war games
[[forced]{.underline}]{.mark} government officials to overcome
''bureaucratic myopia,'' moving beyond their normal organizational roles
and thinking more creatively about how others might react in a crisis or
conflict. [The **skills of [imagination]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
subsequent [ability to predict]{.mark} **foreign interests and
[reactions]{.mark}** [remain critical for]{.mark} **real-world foreign
[policy makers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, simulations of the
Iranian nuclear crisis\*held in 2009 and 2010 at the Brookings
Institution's Saban Center and at Harvard University's Belfer Center,
and involving former US senior officials and regional
experts\*highlighted the dangers of misunderstanding foreign
governments' preferences and misinterpreting their subsequent behavior.
In both simulations, the primary criticism of the US negotiating team
lay in a failure [[to **predict**]{.mark} **accuratel[y]{.mark}**
[how]{.mark} **other [states]{.mark}**]{.underline}, both
[**[allies]{.mark} and adversaries**[, would behave **in response** to

**force students** to challenge]{.mark} **their [assumptions]{.mark}**
[about how]{.mark} other [governments **behave** and]{.mark} how their
own government [work]{.mark}s]{.underline}. Since simulations became
more common as a teaching tool in the late 1950s, educational literature
has expounded on their benefits, from encouraging engagement by breaking
from the typical lecture format, to improving communication skills, to
promoting teamwork. More broadly, [**[simulations]{.mark}** can [deepen
**understanding** by asking **students** to link **fact and
theory**]{.mark}]{.underline}, providing a context for facts while
bringing theory into the realm of practice. These exercises are
particularly valuable in teaching international affairs for many of the
same reasons they are useful for policy makers: [they force
**[participants]{.mark}** to [''grapple with]{.mark} the issues arising
from **[a world in flux.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Simulations have been
used successfully to teach students about such disparate topics as
European politics, the Kashmir crisis, and US response to the mass
killings in Darfur. Role-playing [[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}
certainly [[encourage **students** to learn **political**]{.mark} **and
technical [facts]{.mark}**]{.underline}\* but they learn them [[in
a]{.mark} **more [active style]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Rather than
sitting in a classroom and merely receiving knowledge, [students
actively research]{.underline} ''their'' government's positions

### 2AC -- Debating Nuclear Risk Good 

#### Debating [nuclear risk]{.underline} is good.

The need for education on nuclear weapons. When it comes to nuclear
weapons, the [[students]{.underline}]{.mark} of [today [have
**less**]{.mark} **lived [experience]{.mark}** to draw on than older
generations]{.underline}. [[Today's]{.mark} typical **college
[student]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[was born after the]{.mark} end of the
[Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline} and has no memory of a time when most
Americans were deeply afraid of nuclear war (excluding, to an extent,
the fiery exchange of threats between President Trump and Kim Jong-un
last year). Perhaps as a result, these students also have very limited
knowledge about nuclear weapons. [[The majority do not]{.mark} have a
strong [understand]{.mark}]{.underline}ing of what **[nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** [are, [their]{.mark} destructive
[power]{.mark}, or [their role in the international
order]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and even fewer have a sense of [how
many]{.mark} nuclear [weapons exist]{.mark}]{.underline}. They [are not
aware of [the]{.mark}]{.underline} \$[1.2 trillion]{.underline} nuclear
**[modernization [program]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in which the majority
of costs come from modernizing and improving delivery systems rather
than performing the technically necessary maintenance of the nuclear
warheads. [History education on the Cold War often addresses the
US-Soviet arms race of that time, but nuclear weapons]{.underline}
[[issues in other regions]{.underline}]{.mark}---[such as]{.underline}
[the tense situation between India and Pakistan---are rarely ever
mentioned. [The]{.mark}]{.underline} distant, but
[persistent]{.underline}, [[possibility of]{.mark} an **unintentional
nuclear [launch]{.mark}**]{.underline} due to unauthorized access,
technical failure, or a cyberattack on warning systems, is also
overlooked, as is general information about which states possess nuclear
weapons [today]{.underline}.

In short, students in the United States (and likely elsewhere) typically
graduate from high school having received almost no information on
nuclear weapons. [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} [generally]{.underline}
[**[assumed]{.mark}** that]{.underline} [[today's]{.underline}]{.mark}
American [[public]{.mark} simply [**doesn't care**]{.mark} about
the]{.underline} **[complicated]{.underline}** [and
somewhat]{.underline} **[abstract]{.underline}** [[issues]{.mark} of
**nuclear [weapons]{.mark}** [and **deterrence** because they **rarely
affect**]{.mark} **people's [lives directly]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, an alternative explanation exists:
[The]{.underline} American [public doesn't know enough]{.underline}
about nuclear weapons [to have much political opinion on them,
**but**]{.underline} [[if they had]{.mark} **more [knowledge]{.mark}**[,
that could **change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If so, [[educating students
**on** ]{.mark}**nuclear [weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} on a large
scale [[could have]{.mark} the **[long-term
effect]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of [creating a]{.mark}n]{.underline}
American [[public]{.mark} that is **politically
[engaged]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on the nuc]{.underline}lear [issue [and
**motivated to hold**]{.mark} **its elected [leaders
accountable]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} implementing nuclear
[policy that **reduces**]{.mark} **the [risk of nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For some students, education on nuclear issues may have an impact beyond
just putting nuclear weapons on their radar (pun intended). Today's
[[**students** are]{.mark} the **[next]{.mark} politicians, scientists,
and journalists**, and some]{.underline} of them [will]{.underline}
inevitably [be tasked with addressing the nuc]{.underline}lear [issue in
their careers]{.underline}. For these students, [early [exposure]{.mark}
to the issues]{.underline} of nuclear weapons [in an educational context
[could be **useful preparation**]{.mark} for grappling with those issues
professionally]{.underline}. Indeed, [for some]{.underline} students,
[[learning about **nuclear weapons** could have a]{.mark} **decisive
[impact]{.mark}** on their career trajectory [and **inspire
them**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to dedicate themselves to solving]{.mark}
**these [problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

## IR Theory 

### Realism

#### Impact Turn - Realism is True and Accurate - COVID 19 Proves Security Dilemma amidst zero-sum competitions for international aid

**Basrur** Rajaratnam School of International Studies, and **Kiliem**
Nanyang Technological University, **21,**

\[Rajesh and Frederick, "COVID - 19 and International Cooperation: IR
Pradigms at Odds", Nataional Library of Medicine, November 9^th^, 21,
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/>, accessed

Even in the world's most integrated supranational organization, the
European Union (EU), member [states readily violate otherwise sacrosanct
principles of cooperation, and realists would not be surprised by how
quickly lofty European ideals and norms made way for national self-help
once the Covid-19 crisis hit the continent.]{.underline} The outbreak
was followed by immediate violation of many existing EU regulations:
competition law, fiscal discipline, and freedom of movement. As
countries closed their borders, [EU capitals went into full nationalist
gear
(Guardian [2020a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR32)).
Without any EU-consultation process, a number of EU countries
immediately closed their borders and decreed export bans. When Italy,
one of the worst affected countries in the world, asked fellow EU
members for emergency relief with critical medical supplies, for several
weeks it was met with precisely what realism would expect]{.underline}:
its neighbors violated the EU's single-market spirit by decreeing export
bans on pharmaceutical equipment
(Braw [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR5);
Reuters [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR25)).

Dismayed by the lack of European solidarity, Rome was happy to accept
support from China, which, though itself badly affected, sent medical
equipment and experts immediately[. Far from being altruistic, however,
Beijing aims to rewrite the Covid-19 narrative. It does not want to be
seen as the point-of-origin of the Covid-19 virus and views the pandemic
as an opportunity to come out ahead of the United States in a zero-sum
competition for global primacy.]{.underline} In Italy and elsewhere,
China's "mask diplomacy" is a noteworthy public relations coup (Kliem
and
Chong [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR16)).
Beijing wants to be recognized globally as a responsible provider of
public health goods in the absence of US leadership, and thereby,
progress towards its ultimate objective of comprehensive power
accumulation relative to Washington.

[Indeed, the US has not only been absent in terms of leadership, but has
also actively engaged in nationalistic self-help at the expense of
others. President Donald Trump of the United States,]{.underline}
Europe's closest non-EU ally and partner, tried to lure CureVac, a
German firm that was developing a promising Covid-19 vaccine technology,
to relocate its Covid-19 research and development division to the US and
to guarantee exclusive American access to the firm's products (Die
Welt [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR11)).
Similarly, Trump sought to block the sale of masks to Canada by a
US-based firm (MacCharles and
Ballingall [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR17)),
though a compromise was arrived at later. The US (like other countries,
e.g. Japan) has also sought to restructure global supply chains in order
to bypass dependence on China (Pamuk and
Shalal [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR22)),
which---if it succeeds---will be a radical and long-term change.

**[Realists also point out that international institutions do not enable
states to concentrate on greater long-term gains for everyone. Instead,
international anarchy forces states to treat international organizations
and institutions essentially like the international system itself: as an
arena for zero-sum competition.]{.underline}** Indeed, [as realism
predicts, the World Health Organization (WHO) has become highly
politicized.]{.underline} For example, **[because of the PRC's refusal
to accept Taiwan as a diplomatically independent, sovereign nation
state, the WHO disregards Taiwan's experience with Covid-19 as well as
related research and development results.]{.underline}** Allegedly
bowing to pressure from Beijing, the WHO does not recognize Taiwan and
refuses to include Taipei's very successful pandemic management
strategies in its reports on global research efforts (Financial
Times [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR14)).
[This also supports the neoclassical realists' argument about domestic
factors. It shows how domestic ideology shapes foreign policy decisions
in China and hinders international cooperation]{.underline}.

[If a severe transboundary global crisis cannot spur international
cooperation, then what can? Realism reminds us that, because of the
trust deficit systemically inherent in an international system
characterized by anarchy, states hesitate to forgo their first instinct
for self-help and zero-sum games, even amidst a common global
challenge.]{.underline}

The previous section documented how social variables might be taken as
having the potential to transform international politics. This section
now turns to an explanation of [why it is so hard to fulfill such
seeming transformational promise]{.underline}. Running throughout is the
argument that [while playing a particular social role or expressing a
particular cultural identity are certainly state interests, they are
necessarily **subordinate to political survival**]{.underline} (as a
sovereign entity with control over its own foreign policy),
"**[physiological" security]{.underline}** (the safety from death and
harm of the state's population), **[and economic
prosperity]{.underline}** (a baseline level of which is necessary to
ensure physiological security). Put simply, [if a state and its
population do not exist]{.underline}, [it cannot achieve anything
else]{.underline}---[such as]{.underline} fulfilling a social role or
**[expressing a cultural identity]{.underline}**---either.36 And [since
survival, security, and prosperity all have a material
base]{.underline}---as Wendt recognizes via his "rump materialism" (he
simply does not think the material base yields determinate
outcomes)---so too must **[states necessarily put the defense of such
interests ahead of social role fulfillment]{.underline}** if they want
to be in a position to play any sort of role in future.37 That is not to
suggest that states do not sometimes---or, indeed, often---make
ideationally driven foreign policy choices that are detrimental to their
other interests. It is simply a description of states' incentive
structure, which much of the time they end up following. It is necessary
at this point to defend the notion that [there is, in fact, a material
base independent of the social world]{.underline} and that
characteristics of that material base can yield causal outcomes. After
all, [military technology does not descend as manna from heaven, but
rather is created via human agency in response to perceived
threats]{.underline}, and thus it necessarily contains a dose of
military culture and broader social identity from the outset. The same
goes for the overall share of national economic resources allocated to
defense, and indeed, money itself is a socially constructed store of
value, albeit one premised upon underlying materially underpinned
wealth.38 Any assessment of strategic priorities is necessarily filtered
through the strategic-cultural lens of the institution(s) doing the
assessing; asking one's navy for an analysis of the relative merits of
sea denial versus power projection, for example, necessarily delivers an
answer infused with that navy's historical trajectory, its sense of its
role in the nation and the world, its internal politics, and so forth.
The broader question of whether the sea---like other geographical
features---constitutes a strategic barrier or a highway similarly
requires cultural interpretation. [Even technologies with such seemingly
self-evident destructive power as nuclear weapons are not self-evidently
"good" or "bad,]{.underline}" either morally or strategically, absent
social interpretation. One might see them as "bad" because of the
potential humanitarian consequences of their use (or because of the
constraints they impose on conventional military options), or "good"
because of the casualties in conventional war they prevent (and
deterrence that they enable at low relative cost). [Their political
meaning is thus socially constructed,]{.underline} even if the
physiological effects on human bodies of their detonation have only one
possible outcome. If military technology and resources require a social
component to be both developed and meaningfully deployed, then Wendt's
contention that there is indeed a "rump" material base but that it is
simply indeterminate---in the absence of a friend/enemy distinction---as
a cause of international outcomes becomes alluring.39 Crucially,
however, **[each of these social choices involves a decisive material
effect that is not open to interpretation.]{.underline}** It may be
debatable whether nuclear weapons are "good" or "bad," but the effect
that one will have on the city and its population of frail, carbon-based
human animals over which it detonates [represents a single, determinate
outcome]{.underline}---and **[a state facing another state armed with
them must therefore make certain necessary calculations based around
that capability]{.underline}**.40 In the same vein, while the strategic
threat/opportunity constituted by [geographical features]{.underline},
such as the oceanic moats enjoyed by the United States and United
Kingdom, [may be a matter of interpretation]{.underline}, [the
underlying **material factor**]{.underline} ---humans' inability to
cross water without spending resources on capital (ships) that could
otherwise have been spent on further ground forces--- [yields certain
necessary outcomes.]{.underline} Indeed, [the very foundation of
relations between major powers]{.underline} after 1945---[secure
second-strike nuclear deterrence]{.underline} and its disincentivization
of conventional aggression41---**[rests on a physical
"fact]{.underline}**": the relative impenetrability of water to the
electro-magnetic spectrum and the associated survivability that it
provides to ballistic missile submarines. The same goes for the decision
over what share of national economic resources to allocate to defense.
Choosing a proportion may indeed be a socially and ideationally informed
political choice, but the underlying size of the resource pools---and
the military potentiality that they underpin--- rests on the total size
of the state's capital stock (both human and physical), which is not a
matter of social interpretation. [And while military technology is
indeed developed in response to human agency, it is done so from within
the technical bounds of the feasible]{.underline}. Such rebuttals apply
more widely: while the balance of power, including resources and
technology, is indeed necessarily interpreted through states' social
lenses, it nonetheless conditions the bounds of the possible even in the
absence of social content. [And when those possibilities include hostile
use, certain behaviors are necessitated by prudent states seeking
survival for their populations]{.underline}. Realists should indeed be
castigated if they infer predictions solely from the balance of
currently existing military hardware---a thin and intellectually
impoverished understanding of relative power---and [critics]{.underline}
are [correct to point out that a large stock of materiel is not the same
as being able to compel another to do that which they would not
otherwise have done]{.underline}, in line with the behavioral output
understanding of power commonly associated with Dahl (as distinct from
the input understanding).42 [But viewing total state power in terms of
overall assets, defined as the state's total stock of
physical,]{.underline}43 [financial]{.underline},44 [and human
capital,]{.underline}45 **[does a better job]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} first [encompassing all the relevant
resources]{.underline}---equipment, stores of value, human bodies and
brains---**[and, second, providing an effective measurable proxy for the
underlying causes of behavioral power]{.underline}** (given that the
latter can only be observed ex post, and is therefore not an effective
predictor of outcomes). None of this is to deny that there is a social
element to the construction of all these power resources, or indeed that
the "material" itself involves a large dose of social input, and this
chapter is therefore not attempting to "settle" the debate over the
precise nature of the relationship. It is simply to point out, rather,
that states' power resources and their effects are not wholly socially
constructed and that the nonsocial element produces certain effects.
Turning to specific arguments over states' pursuit of status, the notion
that achieving a particular elevated status and thus fulfilling a
certain international-social role might be a goal of states is
relatively uncontentious.46 For instance, one insightful recent
constructivist work on Britain's pursuit of international status
suggests at the outset that states' social roles are not the same as
their interests, ambitions, values, or capabilities.47 Yet the same work
later asserts that social role actually produces national interests,
thus implying that states cannot in fact have interests besides those
constituted by identity.48 Such conceptual tensions are symptomatic of a
theoretical dilemma: the more minimal former assertion is the harder to
refute, yet the more ambitious latter claim is necessary if
constructivists are to escape the realist retort that fulfilling a
social role is merely an interest of states---and a subordinate one to
materially underpinned survival at that---rather than the interest.
Escaping this retort is in turn necessary if constructivists are to be
able to claim that anarchy is indeed what states make of it socially,
since [transforming the prevailing culture of anarchy would require
states to lower their guard against each other---and thus accept higher
risk to their survival,]{.underline} at least **[while the hoped-for
transformation was taking place]{.underline}**---in pursuit of an
international- social value. The less contentious point---that playing a
particular social role is one of multiple interests---opens the way to
conceding that the most fundamental state interests remain "political"
survival (of state territory and institutions), "biological" security
(of the citizenry's bodies), and preserving some baseline level of
economic prosperity, [since **a state that cannot survive cannot achieve
anything else**]{.underline}. But if that is the case, then from these
materially underpinned vital interests follows a need to be capable of
defending them against potential foes---and that, if it comes to it,
**[means accomplishing certain military missions]{.underline}**.49 Such
military capability is necessarily underpinned by material resources,
even as it also has a socially constructed dimension. Such capability
can be provided independently (internal balancing), via allies (external
balancing), or through some combination of the two---prudent strategy,
including eschewing avoidable confrontation and aligning with the
preferences of powerful allies, is a key aspect of state success50---but
either way, it rests on some friendly actor's underlying resources. And
reliance on external balancing brings its own dangers, as recently
experienced by European NATO, when one's allies turn coercive.51 In
short, such an analysis---while conceding that social role and status
are important to states, all else held equal, and that such concerns
sometimes drive them to act in imprudent ways---nonetheless suggests
that hedging against abandonment, coercion, or outright destruction via
balance-of- power positioning is likely to remain pervasive. This is not
to say that there will not be variation in the extent and severity of
such competition. [All manner of ideational variables might exacerbate
or reduce tensions,]{.underline} as discussed above, and even in the
absence of such social forces, [overt]{.underline}, intensive
[competition may yield self-destructive outcomes]{.underline} if it
increases another side's insecurity and causes them to adopt a more
offensively capable strategic posture in response.52 [The point, rather,
is simply that conflict will never be a wholly absent
possibility]{.underline} and that that reality must condition states'
calculations---[often to the point of some level of defensive hedging,
if the state has the resources and technology to make that
feasible]{.underline} ---[**even in times of broadly cooperative
relations**. A similar retort can be made against the claims that threat
perception and military doctrine are both so fundamentally skewed by
culture that they may be commonly and wholly disconnected from
balance-of-power concerns]{.underline}, and which subsequently allow for
an end to military balancing, mutual threat, and security competition.
While this short chapter is clearly not the place for an extensive
review, the [success of many states]{.underline}--- particularly
resource-rich ones---[in aping military technological and professional
best practice]{.underline} would seem to [suggest that much of the time
states are able to achieve]{.underline} what Gray, borrowing from
marketing theory, dubs "[good enough]{.underline}" **[force postures in
the face of strategic uncertainty.]{.underline}**53 Similarly, [when
states do "die" in the face of foreign aggression]{.underline}---a rare
occurrence in post-1945 international politics---**[it is more often as
a consequence of their relative military weakness]{.underline}** and
geographical vulnerability than as a consequence of a failure to
perceive a looming threat.54 Indeed, a key contribution of the
neoclassical realist research program has been to demonstrate that while
domestic-political variables may filter strategic behavior in
multifarious and often nefarious ways, there are still underlying
balance-of-power structural pressures at the international-systemic
level that states usually respond to, even if they do so belatedly or
imperfectly.55 In short, [while]{.underline} Waltzian
"[socialization]{.underline}" toward accurately perceiving threats and
formulating effective military doctrine [may frequently be
hindered]{.underline}---[and]{.underline} sometimes
[terminally]{.underline} compromised---by cultural factors, as a
description of the workings of the international system as a whole (as
he intended his theory to be), [realist predictions of enduring concern
and possible competition over the distribution of material power are
**not undermined**]{.underline} by this recognition.56 Tellingly,
despite their strong ideational commitments toward democracy promotion
and human rights enforcement under the banner of upholding international
order, Western states have recently had the reprioritization of
balancing against increasingly capable rivals forced upon them by
developments in the balance of power, whether that be China's rise in
Asia for the United States or Russia's (partial) resurgence in Europe
for the rest of NATO.57 Finally, even national identity and the
nationalism it engenders---the ideational "master variable" underpinning
the nation-state system---is itself forged by the interaction of
political group identity and the survival imperative under structural
anarchy. To paraphrase Tilly, **[war makes the state, and the state
makes war.]{.underline}**58 [Modern nation-states may have originated as
political groups of individually weak human beings with some shared
identity connection]{.underline}, [but their choice to form states as
protective war machines capable of generating the military power
necessary to defend against similar political units,]{.underline} and
the subsequent mutual reinforcement of national identity and state
strength, **[is very much consistent with realism's
predictions]{.underline}** of the consequences of international
structural anarchy. Indeed, as noted earlier, Mearsheimer uses these
grounds to argue that [nationalism and realism are mutually supportive
theories.]{.underline}59 In the post--Cold War world, moreover, mutually
threatening political groups' need to generate the military power
necessary for security under anarchy---the security dilemma, in
short---[helps to explain the explosion of ferocious ethnonationalist
and sectarian conflict within]{.underline} and between the new
[states]{.underline} emerging from the collapse of previously
multiethnic communist federations, secular Middle Eastern autocracies,
and so forth.60 Such conflict has in turn forged the identity of the
states and state-like entities emerging from it. In short, while it is
certainly not impossible for national identities to shift, as noted
above, the process of their generation nonetheless suggests that they
are endogenous to---rather than readily capable of exogenously shifting
to transform---international systemic security competition and
balance-of- power positioning, that they are as much a dependent
variable as an independent variable

### 2AC -- Realism/Perm

#### Perm do both -- IR is reflexive, constantly changing and can be re-appropriated 

**Abraham, 17**---Johns Hopkins University (Kavi Joseph, "Making
Machines: Unlikely Resonances between Realist and Postcolonial Thought,"
International Political Sociology (2017) 11, 221--238, dml)

This passage marks out one of the biggest obstacles to connecting
realist and postcolonial thought: race. One would be hard pressed to
find in realist theorizations anything resembling a supple understanding
of race and racism (Vitalis 2015)--- though Carr (2001b, 107)
demonstrates a comparatively great deal of reflexivity on postcolonial
liberation (see fn. 2 above). Even in Williams's (2005) "wilful" realist
tradition, there is scant discussion of how an embedded ethic of
critical self-limitation fared in the context of racial or other forms
of radical difference. Absent an engagement with the analytics of
postcolonial thinking, or the diverse ways in which white supremacy,
patriarchy, and heteronormativity inflect past and present liberal
imperial formations, willful realism does not address the categories
that threaten to push prudential skeptics toward violent responses, that
pose limitations to an ethos of limits. As evidenced in Morgenthau,
failure to think critically about race opens up the way for Morgenthau's
theoretical practice to be driven toward resentful rather than careful
ends. It is at this juncture that [those concerned with contemporary
imperial formations are confronted with a number of possible
[responses]{.mark}: one is to **[deem realism]{.mark}**, in all its
**complex** and **contradictory manifestations**, [as]{.mark} a
**failed**, **unethical**, and **[fundamentally racist/]{.mark}imperial
project**]{.underline}. A second response is to politically align
against liberalism, while holding this partnership at arm's length. [A
third response]{.underline}, derived from Ayoob's (2002) subaltern
realism, [is to work on an **epistemic register**, **selectively taking
insights** from realist traditions that help better explain the
neocolonial world]{.underline}. Morgenthau's racist interjections should
be critiqued and confronted---perhaps by outlining the innumerable
non-Western contributions to the making of so-called Western modernity
(Hobson 2004)---but this [[failing **does not delegitimize**]{.mark}
**other [realist insights]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What is important for
Ayoob's (2002) accommodationist stance is to combine plausible realist
insights with other categories that can grasp the extent of global
politics, including the dynamics of the postcolonial experience, better.
The final response is the one I advance. To adopt a mode of
argumentation concerned with [building a counter-imperial machine is to
neither **dismiss constituencies** that become caught up in imperial
formations, nor merely to **tactically align with them**; rather,
**establishing resonant connections** among postcolonial and realist
lines of thought, **[highlighting shared dispositions]{.mark}** to
difference, is to [push]{.mark} the latter [toward]{.mark}
**repositioning itself on [new ethical lines]{.mark}** [that
**limit**]{.mark} **contemporary forms of [violence]{.mark}**. To
recover a minor position in realism is **[not to accept all realist
positions]{.mark}**, nor is it to synthesize or convert any theoretical
line into a coherent framework. It is]{.underline}, however, [to
**amplify the shared spirituality** that informs both realist and
postcolonial thinking, drawing constituencies toward **prudential**
rather than **imperial defenses of difference**. It is to **furnish
current research agendas** with an **anti-imperial focus**, to seek the
**creative possibilities** that may arise when divergent constituencies
meet, interfuse, and shift]{.underline}. Thus, our response to
Morgenthau, as to other realists, is to cultivate the connections that
do exist, not for epistemic reasons but for a political project that
strengthens counter-imperial movements. Thinking from the Present By way
of conclusion, it is important to reiterate the politics that motivates
a theoretical project of linking realist and postcolonial thinking. If
the ends of this project were to simply gather critiques of liberalism
and its relationship to imperial practices, then certainly a return to
classical realist thought adds little epistemic value over and above
postcolonial approaches. However, [the ends of this argument are to
outline and energize a **counter-imperial machine**]{.underline}, to
cultivate a shared spirituality [that can **gather diverse** and
**divergent constituencies** to confront dangerous
practices]{.underline}. In my estimation, [[countering an imperial
machine that operates in **complex ways**]{.mark} and at **complex
sites** [requires]{.mark} a political strategy as **unwieldy** and
**diffuse**, [linking constituencies that we **may otherwise
dismiss**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[That]{.mark} a tradition of
[realism]{.mark} **regularly [circulates through halls of
power]{.mark}** across the globe **[should be reason not to
reject]{.mark} righteously** [but]{.mark} rather [to **leverage its
authorized status**. We can talk about **imperialism**]{.mark},
**knowledge production**, [and **race** here, while they]{.mark} can
talk [about **anarchy**]{.mark}, **power**, and **self-interest**
[there---or we]{.mark} can theoretically work on the lines of thought
that **reverberate among us**]{.underline}. To reiterate, building a
countermachine is not driven to "pragmatic" reconciliation or consensus
and, thus, remains distinct from the "eclecticism" of other plural
approaches popular in IR today. While the combinatory logic of
paradigmatic synthesis has its place, the connections between realist
and postcolonial thought articulated here are made in a far more
agonistic manner. Rather than produce something like a
"postcolonial-realism," [this]{.underline} argument [involves
[push]{.mark}ing contemporary [realist scholarship toward **new research
agendas**]{.mark} and **new forms of critique**]{.underline} that both
capture a spirit internal to its own traditions while confronting the
realities of contemporary global politics. It engages with minor
positions along the realist canon to orient today's realism away from
the logic of great power politics operating under anarchy toward an
understanding of how the logic of liberal order permits forms of
imperial intervention. Needless to say, [drawing together realist and
postcolonial thought]{.underline}, as this essay has done, [can be met
with **analytical skepticism** and **political hostility**. A mode of
argumentation that **refuses comparisons** of theoretical cores or
non-truncated readings of select theorists strikes a note of
**analytical evasion**]{.underline}. To this there is no defense---other
than that already discussed at length. On the other hand, if the
expressly political purpose of this work is accepted, [the argument
anticipates **strong political reservations**: why align the project of
postcolonial theory with realism, an **unethical tradition of
militarism** and **realpolitik**?]{.underline} To this I would respond
that while a kind of strategic essentialism has its place,
[[**reducing** "realists"]{.mark} to a coherent body of thought not only
**obscures the complexity** of their thinking]{.underline} (see
never-ending interpretations of Machiavelli as an example) [but
**[reproduces the narrative]{.mark} of transhistorical unity** [that
some]{.mark} realists [use to **authorize unethical**]{.mark} **policy
[programs]{.mark}** in the first place]{.underline}. More critically,
however, [in embodying an **unproductive ahistoricism**, it poses
conventional realist categories of **anarchy**, **selfinterest**, and
**military power** as the **political problem to confront** whereas the
present historical context **demands attunement** to how some of these
drives]{.underline} (militarism, national interest) [**connect with
discrete problems** of liberalism and imperial practices]{.underline}.
In fact, there are good reasons to think that the dominance of
(neo)realism in IR is overstated (Walker and Morton 2005; Maliniak et
al. 2011) and that the ascension of liberal IR theory is sociologically
tied up with the present hegemony of a US liberal world order
(Sterling-Folker 2015). In other words, while realism may have been a
productive foil in Cold War bipolarity, we must theorize from the
present. In doing so, we may find that [[countering imperial formations
**may benefit from resonances**]{.mark} **established**]{.underline} not
just **[[among]{.underline}]{.mark}** postcolonial, feminist,
poststructural, and other "critical" theorists but [**contemporary
[realists]{.mark}** who identify links between liberalism and
imperialism]{.underline} (Walt 2013). Indeed, [[if realism]{.mark} as a
policy program defending the national interest [is **entangled
with**]{.mark} **current militaristic** and [**imperial interventions**,
we should **push the premise**]{.mark} of this statement, [that
**difference should be defended**, in **anti-imperial**]{.mark} and
**prudential [directions]{.mark}**. Doing so may allow **new openings to
emerge** in the present sense of closure, **new strategies to think**
and **defend alternative politics**]{.underline}. In this way, we may
more fully embody postcoloniality by not being satisfied with either
narrow critique or brash conversion but rather attentive translation.

### Liberalism

#### Economic Liberalism Key - Interdependance through economic incentives ensures cooperation and democracy to preserve international peace - COVID + numerous pandemics prove

When the fates of states are bound together, liberals claim, they must
cooperate or pay a very high price. [The global economy, for instance,
is a complex network of trade, finance and manufacturing that places a
premium on cooperation. From this perspective, states must cooperate to
stem pandemics that flow seamlessly across the world and impose high
costs on all societies]{.underline}. They must share knowledge and
material resources to counter a scourge that harms them all. They
certainly do so, for example, in [US-led efforts to ensure the reliable
availability of equipment to combat pandemics
(Tribune [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR34)).
But they do not cooperate consistently. The United States has sought to
corner scarce medical supplies
(Bradley [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR4)),]{.underline}
European states have failed to coordinate policy (The
Guardian [2020a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR32)),
and [China and the United States are squabbling over responsibility (Shi
and
Wu [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR29)).
In short, the pattern is much as in another arena of contest between
interdependent states: the as yet unfinished "trade war."]{.underline}

Why? Interdependence does not automatically produce cooperation. It is
only when [the breakdown of interdependence raises the prospect of
serious catastrophe that states cooperate.]{.underline} When
nuclear-armed states are on the verge of war, for instance, they engage
in tacit cooperation by practicing extreme caution and often seek
explicit accommodation through talks, as was the case in Cold War
crises. Even so, they continue to compete through arms racing, alliance
building and occasional brinkmanship. Comparatively low levels of
interdependence amidst the Covid-19 outbreak are unlikely to generate
high levels of cooperation as the threat to national survival is
limited.

[The onset of pandemics has certainly produced unprecedented cooperation
among epistemic communities, such as virologists, in a transnationalized
world.]{.underline} [Scientists from many countries have worked together
to manage the threat of a viral outbreak ever since the outbreak of
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002.]{.underline} The
appearance of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012
quickly led to the activation of a scientific network that has been
dubbed the "SARS club"
(Butler [2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR6)).
More broadly, the onset of MERS spurred global research, producing as
many as 883 scientific papers in 92 countries between 2012 and 2015
(Zyoud [2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR37)).
Likewise, as the New York Times has noted, [the Covid-19 outbreak has
galvanized unparalleled cooperative research in which scientists have
bypassed standard protocols and competitive secrecy to engage in shared
efforts (Apuzzo and
Kirkpatrick [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR1)).]{.underline}
But, not for the first time, politics has trumped cooperation. [The
possibility of a quantum leap in global scientific collaboration has
been stymied by the China-US spat, which has reduced the prospects of
shared funding and finance to fight the virus. The US, for instance,
stopped funding of a critical coronavirus-related training program for
Chinese and other scientists even before the current
outbreak.]{.underline} National priorities have overridden collective
action, which is entirely in accord with realist expectations
(Baumgaertner and
Rainey [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR3)).

The same malaise afflicts international institutions, which liberals see
as fostering high levels of cooperation. The Group of 7 major economies
(G7) failed to organize a summit meeting in March 2020, while a
subsequent meeting of their foreign ministers came up with no more than
an anodyne statement seeking to foster research cooperation and do
"whatever is necessary" to counter the economic fallout of the crisis
even as they disagreed on whether China was to blame for the onset of
the crisis
(Schult [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR28)).
The G20 did not do much better. [It did support debt relief for poor
countries, but its announced \$5 trillion injection into the global
economy was in fact no more than the sum of moneys already committed by
its individual members for themselves
(Chodor [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR7)).]{.underline}
The institution at the center of the crisis, the WHO, has been
acknowledged as critical to the information flow relating to the crisis.
But the WHO has also been dogged by controversy for announcing the onset
of the pandemic late (on 11 March, [by which time it had already spread
to 113 countries) and for apparently deferring to China in doing so
(Basrur [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR2)).
Such failings have brought much criticism and calls for its reform
(South China Morning
Post [2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649056/#CR31)).]{.underline}

Considering Eastern Mediterranean as a regional subsystem, one can see
that it reflects the global arena presenting its mini projection but
adding some regional actors. This is explained 67 Mariya Erkan by the
interdependence of global and regional fluctuations as mutually
influencing components of one whole, that is, the regional subsystem is
a part of the global international system. Indeed, the Eastern
Mediterranean is part of the Mediterranean region, which is adjacent to
Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, which can be considered as
separate subsystems, and which also provides the opportunity to enter
the World Ocean. Russia's presence in the Eastern Mediterranean is
opposed to the active actions of the United States and its Western
allies in the face of the European Union in the region. Moreover, [the
last decade has been marked by the increasing activity of both
regional]{.underline} (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Turkey) [and global actors]{.underline} (China). [The discovered
reserves of energy]{.underline} resources in recent years are [of
strategic]{.underline} [importance]{.underline} and can [affect the
distribution of power]{.underline} both in the region and
[undermine]{.underline} [Russia's position in the
international]{.underline} [arena]{.underline}. Therefore, [controlling
its extraction and transportation in the region allows Moscow to keep
dominant position]{.underline} in the supply of energy resources to
Europe. Another important aspect of [Russian interest]{.underline} in
the region [is]{.underline} [security]{.underline}. Before considering
these factors, it is worth paying special attention to the structural
modifiers that play a role in shaping Russian foreign policy towards
Eastern Mediterranean. [Russia's geographic location]{.underline}
relative to the Eastern Mediterranean region has [predetermined its
policy]{.underline} for centuries. The vast territory of Russia has [no
access to warm seas,]{.underline} which naturally [impeded its trade and
economic development]{.underline}, as a result of which Russia has
historically sought to find a way to the shores of warm seas expanding
its defensive territory to the south. The events of the [Arab Spring
provided an opportunity to strengthen Russian position in the
region]{.underline}, which culm[inated in Russia's engagement
in]{.underline}to the [Syria]{.underline}n Civil War. Providing
significant military and diplomatic support to the Assad regime, Russia
got under its control the naval base in Tartus, the strategic port of
Latakia and the Khmeimim air base in Syria, which allow Moscow to
project its influence and power not only in the Middle East, but also in
the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. Two of these military bases,
namely a naval base in Tartus and an air base in Khmeimim ensure
Russia's presence in the region in the extended time frame for 49 years
(long-term) starting from 2017 (Legucka, 2020: 2). [This region is a
"south key" to open the "door" to the World Ocean]{.underline} and
[project Russian power globally.]{.underline} Thus, the Eastern
Mediterranean, which is located at the intersection of the Middle East,
Europe and North Africa and provides access to the World Ocean, is an
important communications and transmission route, thereby, [representing
a strategically significant region for Russia]{.underline} in terms of
projecting its influence and power. Another structural modifier that
[affects the way actors interact and behave towards each
other]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [the]{.underline} offense-defense
[balance in military technologies]{.underline}, which [intensifies the
security dilemma]{.underline} in the relevant region. Russia [got access
to naval and air]{.underline} facilities [in]{.underline}
[Syria]{.underline} that has expanded its operational capabilities
throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as beyond. Thus, for
example, a naval base in Tartus has the potential to
[accommodate]{.underline} eleven [warships]{.underline}. As Russia's
case shows, its activities in the Eastern Mediterranean are largely
built on the perception of the ongoing enlargement of the European Union
and NATO, and their immediate proximity to the borders of Russia,
thereby exacerbating the feeling of a "besieged fortress" (Delanoë,
2014:24). Thus, [Russia's presence in the Eastern Mediterranean is
primarily conditioned by its national security
requirements]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the consistent development of
the European Union in the process of enlargement has institutionally
complicated its foreign policy decision making, which impeded the
European Council "to reach a clear consensus on the EU's policy in
Syria, Libya, or Turkey" (Pierini, 2020: 104). Meanwhile, the
[COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic that began in 2020 has [created
uncertainty]{.underline} and further **[distracted]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} [E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion
[from]{.underline} the Eastern [Mediterranean affairs]{.underline}
(Pierini, 2020: 104). Furthermore, there has been [a relative weakening
of the US role in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle
East,]{.underline} which **[led to a power vacuum]{.underline}** (Dalay,
2021: I). This, in its turn, **[contributed to the opening of a window
of opportunity for other actors]{.underline}**, and, as a consequence,
[led to Moscow's decisive actions in this region.]{.underline} As noted
by Dario Cristiani, Russia's approach is "exploiting strategic vacuums,"
(Cristiani, 2020: 2) which is recently being traced in its foreign
policy. Nevertheless, it would be imprudent to claim that Washington is
completely leaving the Eastern Mediterranean, reorienting itself to the
Asia-Pacific region. As the former US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta
noted, the ratio of American naval power between the Pacific and the
Atlantic would change by 60/40, in contrast to the previous 50/50
(Perlez, 2012). Despite this shift, the Eastern Mediterranean remains a
strategically important region for the United States, allowing it to
project its power. This 68 A neoclassical realist perspective on Russian
foreign policy in the Eastern Mediterranean in the Putin era region is a
kind of 'springboard' for exerting US influence in a number of
directions, mainly in Africa and deep into Eurasia, reaching Central
Asia, which is of interest to Washington in the geo-political
confrontation with China above all (Nopens, 2013: 3-4). These were
external systemic incentives, which influenced Russia to tailor its
foreign policy in accordance with the circumstances designed by the
international system. Russian foreign policy in the Eastern
Mediterranean is also closely linked to its Middle Eastern policy, as
its posture in the Eastern Mediterranean is intended to preserve its
gains in Syria. [Thus, Russia's policy in the region is dictated by a
defensive position and]{.underline} [a]{.underline} simultaneous [desire
to assert itself as a great power]{.underline} within the international
system, a power, which is **[capable to transform the existing rules of
the world order]{.underline}**. However, there is another point of view.
Some researchers believe that the main driver for Russia's activity in
the region is not its desire to establish itself as a great power due to
the lack of the necessary means for this, but the pragmatic task of
ensuring the security of its southern flank in the event of a possible
conflict with NATO (Rumer, 2021: 1). As it was mentioned above, the Arab
Spring and subsequent events in Libya and Syria provided Russia with
opportunities to expand its participation in the region. Representing
itself as a great power and being at the same time an external actor in
the Eastern Mediterranean, Russia took its place in the complex
equilibrium of interests of external and regional actors. It has managed
to forge relations with all the key regional powers. The power structure
of the Eastern Mediterranean is characterized by the involvement of
major powers (China, European Union, Russia and the United States),
regional powers with direct access to the Mediterranean (Israel and
Turkey), and Middle Eastern regional powers (Iran, Qatar, and Saudi
Arabia). In addition, there is a de facto divided Cyprus that is facing
off against Turkish pressure. In their dispute over energy resources,
Russia also plays an important role, influencing the balance of power[.
Kremlin seizes every opportunity to exert its influence on any crisis
situation]{.underline} in the Eastern Mediterranean, which would make it
possible to freeze competitive projects for the extraction of energy
resources and their transportation to Europe continuing to keep a
dominant position in the supply of energy resources. Indeed, [the
destabilized situation]{.underline} in the Eastern Mediterranean [causes
concern in the ranks of]{.underline} the EU and [NATO]{.underline},
thereby distracting them directly from Russia itself. For example,
Russia has offered its mediation services between Cyprus and Greece with
Turkey on the maritime delimitation and division of Eastern
Mediterranean energy resources accordingly, which could potentially
[expand its influence]{.underline} on the southern borders of the EU and
NATO taking in consideration their indispensable geopolitical
significance for Western allies' positioning in the region. In addition,
by doing so, it would displace Germany, which is the preferred
intermediary in this dispute (Madeira, 2020). Another leverage of
Russia's influence on the extraction and supply of energy resources is
its striving to participate in regional energy projects. For example, in
2017, a 30% stake in the Egyptian Zohr gas field, which is the largest
gas field in the Mediterranean Sea, was acquired by the Russian
state-owned company Rosneft (Rosneft Information Division, 2017).
Besides that, other Russian companies got energy contracts in Libya and
Syria (Legucka, 2020: 2). [Russia used its military position in the
Eastern Mediterranean to strike at ISIS positions in Syria, thereby
demonstrating its power and establishing itself once]{.underline}
[again]{.underline} as a great power in the transforming international
system. The [United States acted similarly during the Gulf
Wars]{.underline}, striking Iraq with long-range missiles deployed in
the Eastern Mediterranean. Thus, [Russia is leaning more towards
internal balancing]{.underline}, rearming its forces and emulating the
successful security behavior and the military practice of its rival.
Vladimir Putin, expressing his sympathy to the foreign policy of
Imperial Russia, is guided by Alexander III principle that "Russia has
only two allies - its army and its navy." The Domestic Level: Variables
Constraining Foreign Policy The difference between neoclassical realism
and earlier versions of realism is its taking into account a number of
domestic factors that affect the likelihood and form of the state's
response to certain international systemic imperatives. Type III
neoclassical realist theory considers four categories of intervening
variables, namely leader images, strategic culture, state-society
relations and domestic institutions (Ripsman, 2016: 58-59). It is
apparent that the figure of Vladimir Putin in power plays an important
role in the activation of Moscow on its southern flank. This is
especially true in contrast to the foreign policy course pursued by the
previous President of Russia Boris Yeltsin, when Russia withdrew from a
number of regions, including 69 Mariya Erkan the Eastern Mediterranean,
and focused its attention mainly on the western direction. Russian
foreign policy under Vladimir Putin stepped up its efforts to return
from abandoned regions and develop new ties and directions. As mentioned
earlier, from the very beginning of his tenure in power, he declared the
need to strengthen Russia's military presence in the Mediterranean. His
assertive foreign policy in the region serves as a justification of its
imperial nature for the Russian society, as well as provides access to
profitable agreements, including energy and military sectors, for his
close teammates (i.e. Gennady Timchenko and Yevgeny Prigozhin) (Legucka,
2020: 1). As is known, one of the continuities of the Soviet period in
the shaping of modern Russian foreign policy is its
'over-centralization' and the role of personal ties within the circle of
political elites (Chernyshev, 2014: 19). The place of the Eastern
Mediterranean in Russian strategic culture is mainly seen as a part of
the larger Mediterranean region, which is adjacent to Europe.
[Therefore, Russian Eastern Mediterranean policy is inextricably linked
with Moscow's foreign policy towards Europe]{.underline}. However, the
events taking place in the Middle East over the past decade have given
even more weight to the Eastern Mediterranean in the foreign policy of
many states, including Russia. Back in 1996, the then Minister of
Foreign Affairs, the famous Arabist Yevgeny Primakov, noted the
importance of this region for Russia as providing direct access to the
strategically important region of the Middle East (Delanoë, 2014: 28).
At that time, the degree of significance was determined by the
instability of the southern borders of Russia itself. [Today, the threat
comes directly from the Middle East region and threatens to revive the
separatist and extremist sentiments of the so-called "soft underbelly"
of Russia]{.underline}. This term was used by Primakov to designate
Russian southern flank (Kreutz, 2007: 11). What is more, the so-called
concept of the "Greater Mediterranean" in Russia's strategy towards the
region, reflected in the Memorandum on Russian Policy in the
Mediterranean of 1995 (Memorandum o politike Rossii v Sredizemnomor'ye ,
1995), implies partnership relations between the countries of the Black
Sea, the Mediterranean and the Middle East, which shows its strategic
importance as one of the parts (subsystem) of a single whole
(international system). As for the perception of the need for Russia's
presence in the Eastern Mediterranean, this is due to the fact that
Russian elites, like Russian society as a whole[, perceive the idea of
Russia's greatness]{.underline} and [do not agree]{.underline} only
[on]{.underline} [defining its role as a regional power]{.underline}
(Lukyanov, 2016: 34). Thus, [Russia's presence]{.underline} in the
Eastern Mediterranean **[meets its national interests in ensuring
economic interests]{.underline}**, [primarily]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the energy sector, and **[security]{.underline}**. The
weak economic and political situation is certainly a limiting factor.
The budget allocated for the military maintenance of Russian troops and
foreign military bases could be distributed to solve domestic socio-
economic problems, and this causes discontent in society. However, the
perception of systemic incentives through the prism of the leader, as
well as the established strategic culture, make their own adjustments to
Moscow's foreign policy decisions. Conclusion **[Russian foreign
policy]{.underline}** in the Eastern Mediterranean **[has become
assertive]{.underline}** in the Putin era. This is due to Russia's
geopolitical, economic and military interests both in the region itself
and in other regions adjacent to it. A number of systemic factors, such
as American declining role in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle
East, regional rivalries, disputes over maritime delimitation and energy
resources, inconsistent Western policy, and the outbreak of military
conflicts open up opportunities for Russia to strengthen its position in
the region and exercise its influence. [Together with systemic
factors]{.underline} (independent variable), [domestic
factors]{.underline} (intervening variables) such as leader image and

### Heg good

#### US hegemony actually benefits smaller states

\*\* this would be a good book to read if you foresee having to go for
this argument! unfortunately i did not have the time so maybe later lol

In America's Global Advantage: US Hegemony and International
Cooperation, [Carla Norrlof argues that the American hegemony is likely
to endure because of the United States' dominance in three areas:
currency, trade and security. It is a highly relevant work given the
current degree of speculation about the decline of the United States and
the rise of China]{.underline}. Norrlof, however, explicitly avoids any
normative implications regarding American hegemony and focuses on how
those three factors interact to produce an enduring hegemonic position
for the United States as well as disproportionate gains relative to the
gains to smaller states. In this regard, the author challenges one of
the basic propositions of hegemonic stability theory.\
[Norrlof bases her theory on **the interlocking aspects** of the
dollar's primacy, the commercial power of the United States and its
military predominance.]{.underline} [The dollar's status]{.underline} as
the key currency [grants the United States material gains as well as
policy flexibility]{.underline}. At the same time, [its massive
commercial role helps to insulate it from the effects of long-term trade
deficits and pushes the costs of adjustment across the international
financial system]{.underline}. [American military predominance cements
those gains by protecting American commercial interests, protecting a
widespread range of allies with a vested interest in maintaining the
status quo, and acting as a guarantor of the United States' role as a
safe haven for investment]{.underline}.\
Norrlof's argument in some ways boils down to one of size; [the United
States' economy is so large that its deficits help rather than hinder
the maintenance of its hegemonic status]{.underline}. [Smaller states
need the hegemon to absorb goods and capital and the negative effects of
large deficits that would affect smaller states do not apply to same
degree to the hegemon. American hegemony is thus neither altruistic nor
exploitative; **it benefits smaller states but also generates
disproportionately large benefits for the United States**]{.underline}.
With this point, Norrlof takes on one of the basic propositions of
hegemonic stability theory which is that the hegemon provides public
goods at a cost to itself that smaller states enjoy as free riders.
Norrlof makes a convincing case that in fact the hegemon can derive
disproportionate gains by threatening to exclude some states by offering
"club" goods rather than public goods.\
It is natural that some speculation about how American hegemony could
end would be a part of a work of this nature. Norrlof's argues that
[American hegemony is relatively stable because another state or group
of states would have to be willing and able to challenge the existing
order, which means forgoing the security and economic benefits they
currently enjoy]{.underline}. She identifies two possible challengers:
East Asia and the European Union. Norrlof devotes a fair amount of
consideration to the possibility of the Euro becoming a replacement for
the dollar, but this seems already somewhat dated given the Greek debt
crisis and its effects on the common currency. Although talk of the
Euro's demise is probably greatly overstated, there is certainly little
chance that it will become a replacement for the dollar in the
foreseeable future. This book was obviously in press before Athens'
fiscal situation became clear so this is not a criticism of the work,
but it is worth noting that [Norrlof's main candidate for a challenger
to American financial hegemony appears to have taken a significant step
backwards]{.underline}. This only strengthens the author's basic
conclusion regarding the endurance of American hegemony.\
One area that could use additional consideration in a work of this
nature is the potential for the sudden collapse of American hegemony.
The U.S. Treasury's gross borrowing has been running as high as \$1.9
trillion a year to finance a \$1.5 trillion federal deficit. It is
difficult to imagine that the federal government can continue to borrow
more than 40% of its annual budget into the indefinite future without
significant consequences. If U.S. debt levels combined with a lack of
growth and rapidly rising entitlement spending leads to a collapse in
investor confidence, there could be a sudden and dramatic fall in the
value of the dollar and, in turn, the ability of the United States to
act as the dominant importer. This would inevitably lead to a dramatic
scaling back of American defense commitments and the subsequent decline
of the ability of the United States to act as the guarantor of the
security of allies or as the safe haven for investment. In other words,
it may not take a challenger to American hegemony to bring it to an end;
the United States may do so on its own.\
Overall, however, this is a notable work that builds [a strong case that
American hegemony is likely to endure for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}. The tone is refreshingly dispassionate and, for a
relatively short work, it marshals an impressive amount of empirical
evidence to support the author's contentions. It is likely to fuel
debates both on a practical and theoretical level as to the nature of
hegemony in the current international environment.

#### NATO is [flexible]{.underline}, meaning that it can easily be adapted and changed to fit the current purposes

Mike **Sweeney**, January 6, **2020** ("What Is NATO Good For?", The
Strategy Bridge, accessed 6/28/2022,
<https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2020/1/6/what-is-nato-good-for>)
//lrap

[What is NATO good for]{.underline}? This is a question that gets asked
a lot these days, and [there is an increasing tendency among many
to]{.underline} mimic 1960s rocker Edwin Starr and [shout,
"Nothing!]{.underline}" Indeed, the run-up to the alliance's 70th
anniversary was accompanied by an outpouring of doubts about NATO's
future and usefulness. At War on the Rocks, the alliance was said to be
both endangering American lives and overflowing with strategic
liabilities as a result of expansion.\[1\] The Wall Street Journal
asserted that the alliance was effectively deceased.\[2\] Writing in The
National Review, Douglas MacGregor found "dead" insufficient, instead
declaring NATO to be a zombie, while Gil Barndollar merely called for
the alliance to retire at 70.\[3\] MIT's Barry Posen beat everyone to
the punch with his OpEd in The New York Times in March calling for a
major reassessment of America's role in the alliance.\[4\]\
Of course, [NATO's obituary has been written many times
before]{.underline}. In the opening to Why NATO Endures, quietly one of
the best books on the alliance, Wallace J. Thies wryly notes that Henry
Kissinger owns the unique distinction of having declared the alliance to
be in serious peril in each of the first six decades of NATO's
existence.\[5\] For the time being, better policies on how NATO is used
should be the focus, rather than scrapping it altogether or withdrawing
U.S. support. Key to this will be working to enhance strategic stability
between the alliance and Russia.\
DE-MYSTIFYING THE PAST\
To some extent, NATO is a victim of its own myth-making. Support for the
alliance is often couched in somber testaments to the wisdom of the
founders and odes to the selfless nobility of collective defense. The
reality is quite different.\
Interestingly, the main strategic rationale for NATO that emerges in the
pages of Thies' book is as a complement to the Marshall Plan: just as
funds from that initiative would allow the Europeans to rebuild their
economies, NATO would remove the burden from the European allies of
having to devote scarce money to their militaries. It would also provide
psychological reinforcement to nations still traumatized by the Second
World War, living in Stalin's long shadow. Once the West European
economies had stabilized and rebounded, they could---in theory---take on
a greater share of their defense and the United States could
recede.\[6\]\
Thus, in the late 1940s, many U.S. officials didn't expect to base
American troops in Europe indefinitely.\[7\] Nor did they necessarily
expect them to have to fight. While the Soviets might attempt mischief
within their own sphere of influence---as seen in the 1948 coup in
Czechoslovakia and the blockade of West Berlin---their ability and
willingness to go beyond that was considered limited by key thinkers
such as George Kennan, who believed the Soviet military and people too
spent from the Second World War to threaten Western Europe.\[8\]
Moreover, Stalin was seen as distinct from Hitler in terms of his
willingness to pursue risk. While the Soviet leader might try to
capitalize on existing chaos and weakness, he wasn't disposed to the
outright aggression that characterized the Nazi regime.\[9\]\
But in a prescient prelude to the defensibility issues surrounding the
admission of the Baltic states, not a great deal of thought was given to
how Western Europe would actually be defended when the alliance was
formed---at least in terms of conventional forces. Of course, in April
1949, America still had a nuclear monopoly.\
The Soviet detonation of its own atomic device in August 1949 changed
the U.S. calculus somewhat, but it was events around the world a year
later that truly focused America's mind on what it had signed up for in
NATO. The conventional defeats suffered by the U.S. military in the
opening stage of the Korean War ,  as much as any development, led to a
realistic discussion of what collective defense would really look like
in Europe---almost eighteen months after the alliance's inception.\[10\]
It was only then that planners on both sides of the Atlantic began to
take seriously the practical questions of defensibility and to set up
integrated military structures---such as the Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe, or SHAPE---to coordinate those efforts.\[11\]
Subsequently, NATO's role as an institution and U.S. force deployments
in Europe would both take on permanence.\
The ad hoc nature of this process is the point worth underscoring. [NATO
was not formed by strategic gods implementing their divine wisdom; it
was the result of hardworking government officials and political leaders
doing their best to deal with the security challenges of the day using
the means at their disposal. That is all the alliance has ever been, and
we exalt its past at the risk of its future]{.underline}.\
NATO AS AN INSTRUMENT, NOT A THEOLOGY\
[Understanding that NATO outlasted its original
purpose]{.underline}---to allow the Europeans to focus on rebuilding
their economies in tandem with the Marshall Plan---well before the end
of the Cold War [illustrates that **the alliance has always been an
adaptable instrument**]{.underline}. It is true that some
twentieth-century luminaries such as Kennan and Dwight Eisenhower didn't
foresee NATO evolving into a permanent fixture in European security at
its inception.\[12\] But should that have stopped the alliance from
becoming an effective military bulwark against the Soviets as the Cold
War developed and demands on the alliance evolved?\
[Just as it adapted and changed throughout its early history, NATO's
purpose now can be whatever is required. This doesn't mean that NATO
should do everything---or be everywhere.]{.underline} The past thirty
years have shown that there are some things the alliance does better
than others and also that there are questionable benefits to unending
expansion of its membership. President George W. Bush's support for
Georgian and Ukrainian membership at the 2008 Bucharest Summit is the
most prominent example of this and likely contributed to both the August
War in Georgia and Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.\[13\]\
But here, too, perspective is needed. Because the alliance should
consider ending expansion doesn't mean previous rounds were inherently
mistakes. [Enlargement]{.underline} permanently settled the Polish
Question---which provided grist for a century and a half of European
wars---and also has [on balance]{.underline} [contributed to stability
between Russia and the Baltic states]{.underline}. Likewise, being
realistic about the failure of the Libya intervention doesn't mean the
1995 operation to stop ethnic cleansing in Bosnia was also a mistake.
The 1999 Kosovo intervention probably falls somewhere in the
middle.\[14\]\
[NATO frankly does its best work when no one hears about it. Its
strength lies in the day-to-day military cooperation it fosters and the
general sense of deterrence and stability it promotes]{.underline}.
These contributions are neither as dramatic as facing off against the
Red Army at the height of the Cold War, nor as controversial as the
Libyan intervention, but they would be glaring in their absence.\
[Why arbitrarily remove the structure that provides that
stability]{.underline}---both with Russia and also among NATO's many
disparate members? [Withdrawing NATO protection]{.underline} from the
Baltic states or the smaller Balkan members, for example, [will not
preclude the possibility of]{.underline} their becoming involved in a
[war with Russia or Serbia; just the opposite, it could make it more
likely]{.underline}. Once such a conflict begins, is it certain the
United States will not be entangled or affected even if it is no longer
actively participating in NATO?\
Again, it is worth reiterating that [NATO is an instrument]{.underline}.
Many of the alliance's opponents may actually be opposed to the way the
United States and its partners have employed force since the end of the
Cold War---especially in the case of operations falling under the rubric
of regime change. The argument, implicit in Posen's OpEd, for example,
is that NATO needs to be taken away from reckless U.S. policymakers to
prevent them from future adventures.\
This argument is backwards. [Yes, the consequences of three decades of
continuous military operations should be examined. But increasing
national restraint and making better strategic decisions seems like a
smarter path than summarily scrapping an effective, tested tool that
could play an essential role in a wiser foreign policy.]{.underline}\
STABILIZING THE PRESENT\
NATO's advocates are also prone to hyperbole, but one word that is not
an overstatement is irreplaceable. It would be difficult---if not
impossible---to recreate NATO or something like it from scratch. Still,
even irreplaceable doesn't imply permanence if the alliance's value
cannot readily be established and sold to the populations of its
constituent members, especially Americans.\
...SHARED HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OR EVEN SIMPLE NOSTALGIA WILL NOT BE
ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN THE ALLIANCE THROUGH THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY.\
Demography is not on the alliance's side. Should NATO survive to
celebrate its centennial, the generation being born at that time will be
as far removed from the end of the Second World War as someone born in
1969 was from the conclusion of the American Civil War. Even the
September 11th attacks---and NATO's ensuing invocation of Article
5---will be a half century in the past. In short, shared historical
experience or even simple nostalgia will not be enough to sustain the
alliance through the twenty-first century. [NATO needs to show that it
is not just relevant, but crucial to continued security in Europe and,
to be blunt, the broader interests of its essential member, the United
States.\
The most effective way of doing that is reinforcing the image of NATO as
a vehicle for stability, something which has been recently
diminished.]{.underline} There are legitimate arguments to be made that
NATO now endangers American security by having antagonized Russia
through enlargement and increased the likelihood of confrontation,
possibly a nuclear one, rather than decreasing it.\[15\] That relations
between America and Russia---and overall stability in Eastern
Europe---might be far worse without the alliance is also true, but is a
difficult sell in trying to promote the alliance's relevance. NATO needs
to be an active participant in visibly promoting stability, beyond the
important day-to-day but low-key role it plays in this regard.\
Some potential steps are obvious, the most high profile of which would
be a public declaration on closing the alliance to further expansion
after the current candidacy of North Macedonia is vetted. To be clear,
such a move need not be taken in a vacuum. In general, NATO must engage
with Russia and some sort of quid pro quo shouldn't be ruled out on
ending further expansion of the alliance. Cessation of Moscow's support
for separatist activities in Transnistria and the Donbass certainly
should be on the table as should guarantees from Russia that Belarus and
Ukraine would be free to pursue their own independent relationships with
the West, perhaps to someday include the possibility of membership in
the European Union if either state wants it.\[16\]\
Even the taboo question of recognizing Russian annexation of Crimea
shouldn't be off limits, though again strong concessions and actions by
Russia to promote security in Central and Eastern Europe must be exacted
in return. There exists a real danger that, in time, the annexation of
Crimea will more-or-less be accepted by the international community,
producing a de facto recognition of Russian adventurism. Would it not be
better to address the question head-on and elicit a price from
Moscow---ideally one that benefits overall regional stability?\
All of this might well be too much to ask. But by pursuing negotiations
along these lines, it would at least have the effect of engaging Russia
in a strategic dialogue---one that could eventually yield results while
also serving as an outlet for regional stress before it metastasizes
into genuine crises. Such a dialogue would also publicly bolster the
image of NATO as a force working to diffuse tension---both in Central
and Eastern Europe and between Russia and the United States more
broadly---rather than being an aggravating factor in those
relationships.\
A more workmanlike complement to this higher-level discussion could be
to resuscitate serious arms control discussions between Russia and NATO.
Unfortunately, the most obvious candidate for attention---the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty---is probably a
non-starter at this point and also an issue that has extended out of
NATO's purview given American concerns over Chinese intermediate range
ballistic missiles in the Pacific. But [discussion on conventional force
deployments is something that the alliance could lead on, perhaps
mimicking the useful negotiations that took place in the late
1980s]{.underline}, ultimately resulting in the Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty.\[17\] NATO could either attempt such
talks directly or channel them through a third-party organization, such
as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
While [new efforts to improve transparency]{.underline} and, possibly,
impose limits on force deployments need not be an exact replica of the
CFE process, or even lead to a formal treaty, they [could be a further
step both in burnishing the alliance's public role as a stabilizing
entity]{.underline} and yet another means of engaging Russia in a
dialogue that, in itself, could contribute to a reduction in tensions.\
A first step to consider in this regard, might be talks between NATO and
Russia on reducing---or even halting---major exercises in close
proximity to one another's territory. As one informed observer has
noted, military exercises are an important part of "the larger
geopolitical discourse."\[18\] Effectively, the conduct of
exercises---and their timing and locale---is a language unto itself. A
negotiated moratorium on large-scale maneuvers, like NATO's Saber Strike
and Russia's Zapad exercises, could be one way for NATO and Russia to
say hello to one another again.\
SEEING RUSSIA CLEARLY\
In all of these efforts, [it is important for NATO to see Russia as it
is]{.underline} and not as it was. To be clear, there is no question
that Russia meddles in the affairs of its neighbors; its annexation of
Crimea and support to the Donbass insurgency speak plainly to this. But
Russia, like any power, is bound by the limits of its capabilities and
they are not infinite.\
[Russian economic resources are, at best, those of a middle
power]{.underline}. In 2018, its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ranked
eleventh after the likes of Canada; price-adjusted GDP is slightly more
impressive at sixth overall globally, but still leaves Russia trailing
Germany, India, Japan, the United States, and China.\[19\] Russia has
chosen to expend these limited resources on an at least half a dozen
neo-imperial projects in Abkhazia, Chechnya, Crimea, the Donbass,
Transnistria, and South Ossetia. There is also Russia's open-ended
military commitment in Syria. Each of these adventures costs money,
limiting Moscow's ability to placate its population through social
programs. That Vladimir Putin's popularity took perhaps its worst hit
after he was forced to raise the retirement age speaks to the long-term
risks inherent in supporting what are essentially six mini-client
states.\[20\]\
Militarily, Russia has steadily rebuilt itself since the nadir of the
early 1990s. In particular, Russia took pains to learn from its shaky
performance during the 2008 war with Georgia and implement needed
reforms.\[21\] That said, Russia of today is nowhere near the menace
that the Red Army once was believed to be. And while it would be wrong
to say that funds aren't available for Russian military modernization,
planned [investments reflect modest improvements rather than
transformative capabilities]{.underline}.\[22\]\
[NATO's strategic depth has also radically changed since the Cold
War]{.underline}, through both the inclusion of Poland and the territory
of East Germany. Russian forces must now also traverse either Belarus or
Ukraine before even touching the edge of NATO's main territory. There
is, obviously, the important exception of the Baltic states which will
be examined later. For all the understandable concern over Russian
aggression in the wake of the Crimean annexation, it is essential to
remember that [the overall military situation and balance of forces has
improved remarkably for NATO in the past thirty years.\]{.underline}
Russia's overall conventional threat to NATO is thus extremely limited.
Would Russia have the wherewithal to occupy Belarus and Ukraine and then
still successfully invade Poland, let alone to enter German territory?
It seems extremely unlikely. Forcibly placating Belarus and/or Ukraine
alone might stretch Russian capabilities to their limits and there still
is the question of economically supporting a prolonged occupation of
those territories.\
...WHEN DEALING WITH RUSSIA, NATO CAN AFFORD TO BE BOTH PATIENT AND
PERHAPS EVEN GENEROUS...\
In sum, when dealing with Russia, NATO can afford to be both patient and
perhaps even generous; after all, the alliance won the Cold War and
maintains a much stronger strategic position in its aftermath. This
doesn't mean that Russia still can't be dangerous, but its diminished
capabilities limit the damage it can do conventionally. Russia can and
does intimidate its immediate neighbors and---especially in the case of
Ukraine---actively undermines their security. But if NATO wants this to
stop and is unwilling to use military force to end the incursions in
Crimea and the Donbass, the only alternative is some kind of negotiated
settlement. That means NATO has to talk to Russia---despite its bad
behavior---just as it once spoke to the Soviets, in spite of their own
serious transgressions.\
MUST NATO NUKE?\
There are, of course, two obvious caveats to the preceding discussion
about Russia's capacity to inflict damage on NATO. The first is that
[Russia does pose a very real threat to the territory of the Baltic
states]{.underline}, inarguably the portion of alliance territory most
susceptible to conventional attack. Second, Russia retains the ability
to devastate all NATO territory, in both Europe and North America,
through its strategic forces. The intersection of these two
issues---Baltic vulnerability and the potency of the Russian nuclear
arsenal---remains at the heart of many arguments by NATO detractors in
America: that the alliance could entangle the United States in an
unnecessary war in northeast Europe, one that would likely escalate to a
suicidal strategic exchange.\
Two corrections are needed to this argument. The first is that Russian
dominance in a war for the Baltics is not absolutely assured. To a large
degree this has become the popularly accepted view following RAND's 2016
wargame series that established Russia could overrun the Baltic states
in as little as 60 hours.\[23\] This does not discount these exercises
wholesale; no doubt, they were an important contribution to the debate
on the viability of NATO's security guarantee to the Baltics and helped
to focus thinking on defensibility in northeast Europe. But it was a
single set of exercises conducted by one organization and one set of
analysts, respected though they might be. Would it not be useful to
replicate conflict scenarios with other planners and analysts who might
bring a different set of assumptions to the gaming table?\
Perhaps the results would be exactly the same, but it is worth asking if
Russia's ability to seize the Baltics is being overestimated---or at
least the speed with which they would do so---and the price Russia might
pay to achieve its objectives. There are a host of variables that come
into play including the actions of other regional actors---such as
Belarus---that are often taken for granted.\[24\] The scope of such
games should also be extended to the essential question of what it would
cost Russia to operate a prolonged occupation of Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania, both militarily and economically. Additional assessments and
a broader lens to examine the second- and third-order consequences of
Russian actions might yield a different perspective on how easy it would
be for Russia to take the Baltic states.\
The second, and perhaps even more important, correction that needs to be
made is challenging the assumption that NATO must resort to nuclear use
if it is unable to win conventionally. This is simply unrealistic in the
current setting and it is essentially a mental hangover from Cold
War-era policies. Nuclear escalation after conventional loss was a
by-product of the perceived conventional weakness of NATO during the
Cold War vis-à-vis Warsaw Pact forces. It should not somehow, three
decades after the conflict's end, be seen as the current de facto
response.\
Yes, it would be difficult and painful to alliance cohesion and
reliability---to say nothing of the Baltic states themselves---if Russia
won a conventional conflict in northeast Europe. But the idea that
preventing that eventuality must lead NATO to use nuclear weapons is
discordant, at best, with the current strategic environment. Moving away
from any discussion of a nuclear response in a Baltic conflict would be
an essential step toward reducing the criticism that NATO endangers
American security more than helping it.\
Moreover, removing the possibility of a nuclear response in a Baltic
contingency would not inherently mean that the alliance was surrendering
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania; there remain viable strategies for
deterring Russia with conventional forces, as seen in the success of
NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence battlegroups.\[25\] Even if Baltic
territory were lost in a war with Russia tactical nuclear forces are
unlikely to save it---not least because they would possibly be employed
on said territory. Win or lose, nuclear forces should thus have no role
in NATO's response to aggression against the Baltics and the alliance
needs to consider declaring that policy publicly.\
Taking this argument a step further, would it boost regional
security---to say nothing of NATO's image as a force for stability---if
the alliance finally relinquished its remaining tactical nuclear
weapons? A definitive answer is beyond the scope of this paper, but it
demands more attention than it has received.\[26\] What is the scenario
where tactical nuclear weapons are somehow deployed to stem a
conventional attack without leading to dangerous escalation? How, for
example, could they be used in a Baltic conflict without sparking a
strategic exchange with Russia and/or decimating large portions of the
territory NATO is supposed to be defending? And if there is no
reasonable applicability for these weapons in a Baltic conflict, why
keep them at all?\
There has been an understandable and necessary debate over the question
of what was and was not promised to Soviet and then-Russian leaders
regarding NATO enlargement at the end of the Cold War.\[27\] This is an
important subject that needs to be examined, but the discussion over
what happened and its subsequent impact on relations between Russia and
the West have, to a degree, obscured another equally prominent move at
the end of the Cold War. In September 1991, President George H.W. Bush
announced the United States would unilaterally withdraw from the field
all of its tactical nuclear weapons, except for a small force of B61
gravity bombs left in NATO Europe.\[28\] Bringing those weapons home
now--- along with a public declaration on a cessation of further
expansion of the alliance's membership---would do much to reset NATO's
image as a force for stability. It would undercut many of the arguments
that the alliance is ultimately a liability for broader American
security interests.\
To reiterate, [NATO is an instrument, one that has shown it can be
adapted to different tasks and goals as the strategic setting
changes]{.underline}. Those adaptations have not always been swift or
graceful, yet [the alliance's endurance speaks to the fact that it
eventually does meet its members' needs. If NATO can reassert itself in
the current environment as **an engine of stability** and not just a
provider of military security it has a much stronger chance of
persevering, even as its origins in the aftermath of World War II and
the early years of the Cold War recede further into history]{.underline}

The Outsiders How the International System Can Still Check China and
Russia Stacie Goddard In late February, as Russian forces moved into
Ukraine, Vladimir Putin declared that his offensive was aimed not just
at bringing Russia\'s neighbor to heel but also at repudiating the
U.S.-led liberal international order. \"Where the West comes to
establish its own order,\" the Russian president railed, \"the result is
bloody, unhealed wounds, ulcers of international terrorism and
extremism.\" Moscow would now seek to roll back the expanding order as
\"a matter of life and death, a matter of our historical future as a
people.\" Russia\'s full-scale war on Ukraine is only the most recent
act in a years-long effort to overturn the existing status quo, one that
has featured cyber- attacks, assassinations, a war against Georgia,
meddling in U.S. elections, military involvement in Syria, and the
annexation of Crimea. As Putin\'s troops neared Kyiv, many observers
kept an eye on China, the other authoritarian power busy rejecting the
U.S.-led order. Over the last decade, Beijing has contested territorial
norms in the South China Sea and built new international economic
institutions. 28 FOREIGN AFFAIRS as the Asian Infrastructure Invest-
ment Bank, to compete with Western- dominated ones, such as the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Beijing and Moscow seem
to have joined forces in their effort to undermine the order. [Just
[weeks before]{.mark} Russia\'s [invasion]{.mark}, Chinese President
[Xi]{.mark} Jinping [and]{.mark} [Putin]{.mark} promised to
[place]{.mark} \"[no limits]{.mark}\" [on]{.mark} the two countries\'
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} as they seek to [[redefine norms of
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}, push back against universal definitions
of human rights, and [secure]{.underline} their \"[core
interests]{.underline}.\" It was not supposed to be like this. After the
Cold War, the [United States relied on a strategy of luring into the
order would-be revisionist powers]{.underline}-that is, countries that
have both the means and the motivation to challenge the status quo. U.S.
leaders argued that by cooperating with China and Russia and
incorporating them into international institutions, they could curb
those countries\' ambitions and perhaps even push them onto a path of
progressive liberalization. Both [countries joined economic
institutions,]{.underline} such as the World Trade Organization;
security institu- tions, such as the [nuclear nonprolifera-
tion]{.underline} regime; and even human rights treaties, such as the
International Cov- enant on Civil and Political Rights. As U.S.
President Bill Clinton\'s 2000 National Security Strategy argued,
alth[ough the United States must be \"mindful of threats to peace,\" it
should seize \"on the desire of both countries to participate in the
global economy and global institutions]{.underline}, insisting that both
accept the obligations as well as the benefits of integration.\" [What
went wrong]{.underline}? Some blame poor U.S. leadership. After four
years of the Trump administration, the argument Stacie Goddard runs,
liberal institutions were left rudderless, providing an opening for
revisionist powers. The Biden adminis- tration\'s chaotic withdrawal of
U.S. forces from Afghanistan confirmed that the United States was
weakened and in retreat. Others, by contrast, contend that the strategy
was futile from the start. According to this view, it was hopelessly
optimistic to expect that China and Russia would embrace liberal values
and accept the idea that the United States should maintain its position
at the top of the international order. Both of these views are
problematic. There is very little Washington could have done to stave
off challenges to the liberal order. Historically, integration into
international institutions has not restrained countries hoping to
challenge the status quo. To the contrary, it has enhanced their ability
to mobilize allies, secure leverage over their trading partners, and
gain legitimacy for their normative visions. It is not simply that
international institutions were unlikely to check China\'s and Russia\'s
revision- ism; their membership in fact assisted their efforts to
transform world politics. On the other hand, it is a mistake to dismiss
institutional integration as a complete failure. If judged by the high
ambitions set by U.S. **[policymakers]{.underline}**, [who thought that
incorporating expansionist powers into international institutions would
temper their ambitions]{.underline}, then it **[has not]{.underline}**
lived up to its promise. But judged by a more reasonable standard, it
has succeeded: [al[though]{.mark} institutional [integration can\'t
prevent revisionism]{.mark},]{.underline} [[it]{.mark} can
[shape]{.mark} the [strategies]{.mark} revisionists use]{.underline}.
Although Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated that
**[[countries bent on expansionism]{.mark} will [charge ahead]{.mark}
regard- less,]{.underline}** on the whole, **[[international institu-
tions]{.mark} can [channel this aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[so]{.underline}**]{.mark} that **[[it]{.mark} [doesn\'t
devolve]{.mark} in[to]{.mark} [bloodshed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Rather
than giving up on institutions]{.underline}, then, [Western]{.underline}
[[policymakers]{.mark} should [adopt a **realistic approach**]{.mark} to
them]{.underline}. [[While]{.mark} they [may not lead
to]{.mark}]{.underline} completely [[harmonious]{.mark}
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline}, they can be **[[a potent tool for
preventing war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A [strategy]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} institutional [[realpolitik]{.underline}]{.mark} would
also [[recognize]{.underline}]{.mark} that for all their coordination,
[[China]{.mark} and [Russia]{.mark} are very
[different]{.mark}]{.underline} types of revisionists. China\'s assaults
have been less violent but in many ways more consequential; where Moscow
has relied on strategies of disruption and violence, Beijing has
preferred to exert influence through growing networks and its position
within international institutions. [That is why the
[one-size-fits-all]{.mark} strategy of the past [fell
short]{.mark}]{.underline}-and why a new approach is called for. [To
that end, the United States [needs to see international
institutions]{.mark} not as a way to transform the funda- mental nature
of its rivals **but [as places that]{.mark} can [become]{.mark} [better
forums for communicating preferences]{.mark}**]{.underline}, resolving
disputes, and **[establishing clear [redlines]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
That, [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} lofty plans to change China and Russia
or a [wholesale [abandonment]{.mark} of institutions]{.underline},
should help [[keep the revisionists in check]{.underline}]{.mark}.

By the mid-1990s, China had emerged as one of the world\'s
fastest-growing economies. In a 1999 speech, Clinton outlined the
challenge of a rising China for American foreign policy, noting that
\"if it chooses to do so, China could .. . pour much more of its wealth
into military might and into traditional great-power geopolitics.\" In
contrast to China, post-Soviet Russia was a declining power, so there
was little concern that the country would emerge as a global competitor
to the United States. Still, Russia had the potential to become a
serious revisionist. Many feared the rise of a Russian nationalist
right, one that would reestablish authori- tarian government at home and
attempt to reassert Russian imperial dominance over the former Soviet
states. [U.S. officials turned to multilateral institutions to deal with
these incipient threats]{.underline}. These policymakers believed that
membership in [liberal institutions would make China]{.underline} and
Russia [more liberal themselves]{.underline} and thus less inclined to
buck the existing international order. Clinton\'s top goal was to help
Russia become a consolidated democracy, one firmly embedded in Western
institu- tions. As for China, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
explained the United States\' position in 1997: \"It is our hope that
the trend toward greater economic and social integration of China will
have a liberalizing effect on political and human rights
practices\"-although she also acknowledged that \"given the nature of
China\'s government, that progress will be gradual, at best, and is by
no means inevitable.\" [Although recent critics of institu- tional
integration have focused on the failure of international institutions to
liberalize China and Russia,]{.underline} [this]{.underline}
[wasn\'t]{.underline} [the]{.underline} only-or even the
primary-[way]{.underline} integration [was supposed to prevent
revisionism.]{.underline} [Even if the two countries remained
illiberal]{.underline} at home, [admitting]{.underline}
[them]{.underline} into existing institutions was supposed to
[encourage]{.underline} [good]{.underline} [behavior]{.underline}
[abroad]{.underline}. Free trade and foreign direct investment would
make them [rich]{.underline}. Participation in international
institutions would grant them [status]{.underline} and prestige. And if
such carrots were not enough to make China and Russia play by the rules,
institutional membership would also pro- vide the United States and its
allies with sticks they could use to [increase the costs of
revisionism]{.underline}. The more Beijing and Moscow came to depend on
interna- tional institutions for their wealth, power, and influence, the
[easier]{.underline} it would be [to]{.underline} [punish]{.underline}
them if they decided to break the rules. Integrating them into global
financial markets, for example, would not only help unlock economic
growth; it could also make the two countries more [vulnerable to
sanctions.]{.underline} Finally, institutions were supposed to bind
China and Russia more closely to the status quo. When countries join
international institutions, their wealth and power become tied to these
organi- zations in ways that are hard to change down the road. This was
the logic behind incorporating Germany into Western May/June 2022 31
Stacie Goddard security institutions, such as NATO, after World War II.
And it was the premise of France\'s decision to rope Germany into the
French economy through the Euro- pean Coal and Steel Community: in doing
so, France ensured that it would retain a voice in German affairs and
that any attempt by Germany to increase its power would be channeled
through institutional pathways. THE RETURN OF REVISIONISM At first,
**[integration seemed to work.]{.underline}** The speed and extent of
China\'s entry into international institutions, especially economic
ones, during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations were nothing
short of astonishing. Throughout the Chinese leader Mao Zedong\'s rule,
the country remained isolated from international institutions, even
after joining the UN, where it had inherited Taiwan\'s seat in 1971.
After its opening in 1979, China was still slow to join interna- tional
organizations. But by 2000, it had become a member of over 50 of them.
It signed both the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. In 2001, China entered the wTO with the Clinton
administra- tion\'s enthusiastic support, and despite vocal protest from
American protection- ists on both the left and the right. Russia faced a
rockier road to integra- tion. Urged on by U.S. economists, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin launched a 13-month plan of \"shock therapy,\"
designed to rapidly privatize the Russian economy. Instead of economic
growth, Russia\'s economy saw its GDP fall by almost half, and poverty
increased from two percent to 40 percent of the popula- tion. Former
Soviet elites took advantage of their position to monopolize owner- ship
over newly privatized petroleum and gas resources. Talks of bringing
Russia into the European security order stalled in 1994, when the United
States abandoned its plans for the so-called Partnership for Peace,
which would have brought eastern European states and Russia into a
security umbrella frame- work, and chose instead to expand the NATO
alliance into eastern Europe. [By the end of the decade, however, Russia
seemed to be turning a corner]{.underline}. The country\'s new
president, Vladimir Putin, was no democrat, but he appeared to be
introducing legal and economic reforms that could liberalize the country
in the long run. To support economic privatization, the United States
per- suaded the G-7 countries to pledge \$28 billion of collective aid
for Russia. In 1998, Russia joined the newly created G-8. In 2012,
Russia\'s accession to the wTO concluded after 18 years of negotia-
tions. The 9/11 attacks brought the United States and Russia closer, and
the two cooperated on counterterrorism and arms control initiatives. At
first, the optimism of those who favored institutional integration
seemed warranted. At the turn of the millen- nium, both China and Russia
appeared eager to act as \"responsible stakeholders,\" as Robert
Zoellick put it in 2005, when he served as U.S. deputy secretary of
state. Soon, however, concerning signs emerged. By 2009, some political
scien- tists began pointing to China\'s \"artificial- island-building
spree\" and saber rattling in the South China Sea as harbingers of
territorial expansion. In 2013, China launched both the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a
massive program investing in infrastructure projects in the 32
developing world. China\'s leaders claimed that these initiatives
comple- mented existing institutions and filled gaps in the current
economic order. Many in Washington, however, sus- pected that China was
seeking to con- struct an alternative economic order devoid of liberal
values. Meanwhile, in 2008, Russia launched its first violent attempt to
redraw the borders of the post-Cold War world when its troops invaded
two breakaway territories in Georgia. It went further in 2014, invading
eastern Ukraine and annexing the Crimean Peninsula. In. 2015, against
vocal Western opposition, the Russian military intervened in the Syrian
civil war to buttress President Bashar al-Assad\'s fragile regime,
provid- ing critical-and often indiscriminate- air support for Syrian
government forces, which with this assistance began to retake contested
territory. At the time, advocates of institutional integration dismissed
these revisionist moves as insignificant and unsustainable. The
political scientist G. John Ikenberry, for example, insisted in these
pages in 2014 that despite these transgressions, \"Russia and,
especially, China are deeply integrated into the world economy and its
governing institutions.\" At most they were \"spoilers,\" he concluded:
\"They do not have the interests-let alone the ideas, capacities, or
allies-to lead them to upend existing global rules and institutions.\"
Policymakers in Washing- ton echoed these confident assessments. In a
2014 speech at West Point, President Barack Obama recognized that
\"Russia\'s aggression toward former Soviet states unnerves capitals in
Europe, while China\'s economic rise and military reach worries its
neighbors.\" But he expressed optimism that international institutions
would continue to \"reduce the need for unilateral American action and
increase restraint among other nations.\" In hindsight, it is easy to
see that this confidence was misplaced. A **[better understanding of the
intersection of international institutions and great- power revisionism
might have tempered such expectations.]{.underline}** Historically, the
**[constraining]{.underline}** **[effects]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}** **[international]{.underline}**
**[institutions]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}**
**[revisionism]{.underline}** have been **[inconsistent]{.underline}**
at best. Even when revi- sionist states were brought into the
institutional order, they were **[still able to pursue
their]{.underline}** **[aims]{.underline}**. When Prussia launched a war
in 1864 that would set the stage for German unification, it was
considered a core member of the Concert of Europe, the order estab-
lished after the Napoleonic Wars to help keep the peace. When Japan
invaded Manchuria in 1931, it was a member in good standing of the
League of Nations and the so-called Washing- ton system, which
maintained limits on great-power shipbuilding. Both Nazi Germany and
fascist Italy were mem- bers of the League of Nations when they began
their efforts to conquer Europe. In short, history gave the lie to the
theory that institutional integration alone could restrain revisionism.
NOT ALL REVISIONISTS Given the mixed record of institutional
integration, it is **[tempting]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}**
**[dismiss]{.underline}** **[Washington\'s]{.underline}**
**[embrace]{.underline}** of this approach as not only futile but also
naive. Indeed, this is precisely what the harshest critics of U.S. grand
strategy are saying. Bringing China into international institutions, the
political scientist John Mearsheimer wrote in these pages in 34 Io REIGN
AFFAIRS The Outsiders 2021, \"may have been the worst strategic blunder
any country has made in recent history: there is no comparable example
of a great power actively fostering the rise of a peer competitor.\" But
**[such criticism overlooks the fact that international institutions
change how revisionists choose to disrupt the
international]{.underline}** **[order]{.underline}**. Institutions may
not have eliminated revisionist ambitions, but they have shaped the way
China and Russia have pursued their aims. [Even with Russia\'s invasion
of Ukraine and its past military action in Crimea and Chechnya, the
country has embraced force **much less** than similar states in history;
c]{.underline}urrent events are so shocking in part because they have
become so rare, a testament at least to some extent to the effects of
integration. Witness how, in the past, a common way to change the status
quo was to mount an aggressive attack. Napoleon\'s France conquered wide
swaths of Europe as it sought to obliterate the last vestiges of the
eighteenth-century dynastic order. When imperial Japanese leaders
decided to break clean of the League of Nations and the Washington
system, they relied on brute force to expand their influence and wrest
economic resources, first in China and then in Southeast Asia.
Ultimately, both France\'s and Japan\'s revisionist campaigns brought
nothing but disaster for their leaders. With this historical antecedent,
it is easy to see why institutionalists of the 1990s be- lieved
revisionism was unlikely. Regard- less of their ambitions, countries
will often decide to content themselves with the existing international
order. The costs of major-power wars were stagger- ing in previous
centuries; they would be catastrophic in the present day. But
revisionists do not always need to use force to upend the status quo. In
fact, the most transformative revisionists engage in rules-based
revolutions. [These revisionists start out looking like reform- ers,
working within existing institutions to achieve their aims]{.underline}.
Over time, how- ever, their \"salami slicing\" of existing
[rules]{.underline} and [norms]{.underline} can **[create significant
weaknesses]{.underline}** in international institutions that undermine
the broader institutional order. When Russia sought to expand its
influence in the Ottoman Empire after the Greek Revolution of 1821, it
used the forums established by the Concert of Europe to push its allies
to recognize Russian rights in Ottoman territories. By using available
diplomatic resources, Russia slowly fragmented the boundaries of the
existing territorial order until it shattered them in the Crimean War,
in the mid-nineteenth century. Prussia provides another example of this
approach, with even more trans- formative results. From 1864 to 1871, it
unified the German states under its rule at little cost and with limited
use of force. German unification not only upended European boundaries;
it also laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution in Germany,
which would vault the country into the top tier of great powers by the
end of the cen- tury. Ideologically, Prussia mobilized new forces of
German nationalism, ripping apart the conservative founda- tions of
European institutions. Yet Prussia achieved this revolution without
sacrificing its position as a core member of European security and
economic institutions. In this way, the country undermined the
foundations of the European order from both within and without. May/June
2022 35 Stacie Goddard To challenge existing institutions, other
revisionists created alternative institutional systems to establish
their own spheres of influence and attract new supporters to their
cause. In the years following World War II, especially after the United
States launched the Marshall Plan in 1948, the Soviet Union withdrew
from various Western institu- tions. Joseph Stalin hoped to increase
Soviet power not by overtly challenging Western alliances but through
political purges in eastern European states. When Moscow would challenge
institu- tions, it would do so either covertly or in areas
geographically outside the core of the dominant order. Looking at the
varied historical record of revisionism, three things stand out.

### 2AC -- AT - IR Racist

#### IR isn\'t anti-black \-- it\'s a [minimalist theory]{.underline} to explain the occurrence of [interstate war]{.underline} \-- purity in [scholastic]{.underline} exercises have [zero]{.underline} concrete solvency.

Richter-Montpetit; GR\]

Racism is a powerful, malignant force in world politics, and our
discipline, IR, has deeply problematic entanglements with it. It is a
serious matter both to come intellectually to grips with this and to
find the most effective strategies to act on it. [We worry
that]{.underline} [more serious **[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
**possibilities** are **marginalised**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by
an]{.mark} ultimately very **[inward-looking]{.mark}** and **[scholastic
exercise]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[where a]{.mark} particular definition
of racism and]{.underline} a specific [theoretical [perspective]{.mark}
makes it possible to [deem the]{.mark} vast [majority of]{.mark}
scholarship in [IR]{.mark} 'racist', 'methodologically white' and
'[antiblack']{.mark}- every work that does not explicitly follow one
exact version of anti-racist scholarship]{.underline}. Especially, [the
role played]{.underline} in H&RM's argumentation [by]{.underline} our
**[sins of omission]{.underline}** [does]{.underline} ultimately seem to
[rest on the premise that **only** their **distinct form**]{.underline}
[of scholarship can be redeemed]{.underline}, because even post-colonial
scholarship and critiques of euro-centrism are not enough; [you are a
racist if you do not follow exactly this particular route]{.underline}.
It is not important whether your scholarship actually supports or
hinders anti-racist analysis or political engagement; [[it is all about
**who you cite**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.mark} what
**[declarations]{.mark} you make**]{.underline}. **[Here]{.underline}**,
[a [theory is not judged by **what can be done with
it**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but]{.mark} by the question [whether
**self-appointed anti-racists** can find **supposedly problematic
sentences**]{.mark} somewhere [in its]{.mark} key
[texts]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this section, we will first point out
that the H&RM article is a personal attack on us for racism, despite
their reassurances about the opposite. Then, we discuss what an analysis
of structural racism (systems of power) could amount to, given that they
claim to do one but utterly fail to do so, resorting instead to a
pretend examination of the foundations of ST. Next, we discuss what
could be methodological guidelines for actually proving whether or not a
theory like ST is racist.

[H&RM's usage of the term racism for all scholarship that does not
foreground race as the primary theme, means that **99% of IR will be
'racist'**]{.underline}. [There will be **no room** for any other
scholarship]{.underline} (unless you will live with the moniker of being
racist). [[Not only does this seem]{.mark} **very
[unproductive]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in terms of disciplinary
conversations, not to talk of **diversity** and **pluralism**,
[it]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[means]{.mark} that [it becomes]{.mark}
**very [hard]{.mark}** [to use]{.mark} the category of ['racism'
for]{.mark} **critical [purposes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for those cases
[where it **actually is at stake**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a sense
closer to what the rest of the discipline, and indeed the public
discourse, means by it. [[It has been **watered
down**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by the fact that everyone]{.mark} but
those in critical whiteness studies [have been deemed
racist]{.mark}]{.underline}, one by one, where we just happened to get
the special honour of being among the first. [H&RM might protest that
this is not their plan, but we **fail to see how this can be
avoided**]{.underline} [when the logic they apply is that the term
racist can be based primarily on **sins of omission**]{.underline} [in
the sense of a theory being focused around other
categories]{.underline}.

As documented above, they claim numerous times that ST 'occludes' or
'refuses' various dynamics relating to race that they find important,
but they never offer any basis for concluding that the theory makes it
harder to see these things, only that it does not as such zoom in on
them. This does not have to do with a choice particularly regarding race
but the structure and nature of the theory as a general analytical
apparatus that can be applied to all instances where actors try to
securitize or desecuritize something, and the user is free then to
include race more or less in this analysis, just as the theory is not
deciding how important nationalism is or gender51, but it enables the
analysis of the way different categories and distinctions become
politically mobilised in security struggles.

[H&RM will probably argue [that if you do not mention race]{.mark} in
these contexts, [you '**hide' it**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Three
answers]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [1) **[no]{.mark}**, [there is a
difference between **not mentioning** and **hiding**]{.mark}, it takes a
step more of the critic to show that the theory **prevents** something
from being articulated]{.underline} or that it uses abstractions that
stand in the way of articulating race; that certainly is the case for
some theories, so it is a legitimate avenue of critique, but they
haven't shown this, [2) [the theory is
**intentionally**]{.mark}]{.underline} (as we have explained numerous
times) **[[minimalist]{.underline}]{.mark}** in having a clear
conceptual core and then [not putting all kinds of factors like the role
of media or populism into the theory \-- **[not]{.mark}** [because we
haven't noticed]{.mark} these [factors but]{.mark} because [they
**belong in applications**]{.mark}, and the theory exactly allows you to
study these phenomena, 3) [we are]{.mark}]{.underline} very [[explicit
that]{.mark} one of the **[advantages of a minimalist
theory]{.mark}**]{.underline} [is the ability to **combine it** with
other theories]{.underline} especially general theories [about the
nature and structures of society]{.underline}; one should not build out
ST to become a general theory of society or international relations,
better in any specific usage of the theory combine it with the theories
one finds productive for the particular research project. (Wæver 2011,
2015) The latter point has come up in replies to the 'sociological'
version of ST (Balzacq), which has more of a tendency to add all
relevant factors to the theory, while the classical Copenhagen version
is tight and invites combination with theories that complement it, which
could exactly be theories of race and racism. Our ultimate concern here
is: how do we actually get to study racism in world politics in a
practically and politically helpful way?

When developing our own framework, ST, [we took **care**]{.underline}
[to make sure it could do critical work in concrete analyses, in our
view on racism as well]{.underline}, and H&RM fail to show that this is
not the case. In addition, we have then on a more mundane, human level
engaged ourselves in various ways to foster non-Western scholarship and
theories in IR (Tickner & Wæver 2009; Acharya & Buzan 2010, 2019). One
has for instance co-founded a book-series with the aim to identify
"alternatives for thinking about the 'international' that are more in
tune with local concerns and traditions outside the West" and
"provincializing the West" (quoting from the Routledge homepage of the
book series); the other has amongst many other things re-written this
history of the IR discipline to show both that it has ignored
non-Western contributions and that the Western part of it is indebted to
'scientific racism' (Buzan & Lawson 2015; Acharya and Buzan 2019).
Closer to ST, the project in Buzan & Wæver 2003 was to a large extent to
challenge the euro-centrism enshrined in dominant conceptions of
polarity and of the relationship between global and regional, to enable
theories to be more attentive to actual security dynamics in 'most of
the world'.

Surely, all of these efforts can be critically assessed as to what has
been helpful and what hasn't. But we find it strange that H&RM choose to
ignore completely the possibility of assessing the ability of ST to form
the basis for helpful analyses of racism. They neither look at those
analyses that have actually been done, nor do they show systematically
why it would be impossible to do so. On the contrary, [they limit
themselves to highly abstract and indirect attributions of racism to the
theory as such through various unconvincing routes]{.underline}. From
this they deduce (without any discussion) that ST can't inform studies
of racism (and when it has actually done it, they presumably are able to
magically make those publications go away) (see section 6 below).

[H&RM offer **[no explanation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as to how
their]{.mark} type of [analysis helps]{.mark} in [combating
racism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is **unclear**]{.underline} [if it is a
kind of **ground clearing operation**]{.underline} [to be followed up by
new and better theories after getting us out of the way]{.underline}.
[Or whether they believe that we are so much a part of the oppressive
structures that attacking us is in itself liberating]{.underline}. Or
\-- as we will consider below in more detail \-- the whole exercise is
more about making universities more inclusive and hospitable to students
and scholars of colour. Closely linked to the latter option, [their
rationale could be that the attack is meant more as a kind of
'happening' drawing attention to the question of race]{.underline}.
[Especially in the latter case, it would be intentional that the article
plays ambiguously with making a very personal attack while pretending
not to]{.underline}.

In this interesting and important yet flawed book, [[Vitalis seeks

narratives of the field's history, he argues, trace it to the rise of
realism and national security concerns in the years around World War II,
adding a few historical thinkers, such as Thucydides, to claim a
timeless intellectual pedigree.]{.underline} But [[this

and the pioneering work of African American writers in what he calls
"the Howard School."]{.underline} Consigning both to the memory hole, he
says, paints a distorted picture of the discipline's origins and nature,
obscuring the role that international relations scholarship has played
in the construction and perpetuation of white Western dominance. These
are major claims, and some of them hold up better than others. [[Vitalis
is correct to shine a spotlight on]{.underline}]{.mark} the forgotten
academic work of the first third of the twentieth century and offers a
timely reminder of just [[how prevalent racialized thinking was and how
central a role imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[[as opposed to

in global affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Back then, for example, "policy
relevance" in political science often meant figuring out how to train
good colonial administrators]{.underline}. Vitalis also provides a
service by telling the story of scholars such as Alain Locke, Ralph
Bunche, and Rayford Logan, enriching readers' understanding of
midcentury [intellectual [debates over U.S. foreign policy and
tracing]{.mark}]{.underline} how [[racism]{.underline}]{.mark} operated

[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[less convincing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
however, in casting his analysis [[as an indictment of the postwar
discipline]{.mark} of international relations, [let alone]{.mark} **[its
contemporary incarnation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To get there, one has
to share his politics. V[italis sees a project of U.S. imperial
domination playing out over the course of the past century, with the
"subjection" continuing today, "through new-old policies of
intervention, tutelage, and targeted killings in new-old zones of
anarchy and civilization deficit."]{.underline} Given such a reading of
U.S. foreign policy, it is not surprising that he believes "the history
of ideas, institutions, and practices \[in the field\] has a
constitutive role in their present forms and functions"---or that he
sees today's mainstream international relations scholars as handmaidens
of an evil national security state and as the direct descendants of
their racist predecessors of a century ago. Scorning the notion that the
postwar liberal international order represents anything particularly new
or admirable, Vitalis scores a few points in noting how long it took for
some [[earlier]{.mark} social and racial
[hierarchies]{.mark}]{.underline}, both international and domestic, to
erode. But he refuses to accept the fact that they
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed **[[eroded]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
One is left wanting more analysis of how and why the attitudes and
**[[patterns of domination]{.underline}]{.mark}** Vitalis describes
[[gave way over time]{.underline}]{.mark}, and how the midcentury
theorists and [[practitioners of the liberal international
order]{.underline}]{.mark} understood and [[handled the paradoxes of its
**halting and inconsistent implementation**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

#### There is no monolithic IR -- the field is [reflexive]{.underline} and [effective]{.underline} -- its [track record]{.underline} of [prediction]{.underline} proves. AND, sweeping criticisms of a fragmented field of research don't answer the [specificity]{.underline} of our studies.

This critique is both narrowly true and narrow in perspective. [Context
is]{.underline} of course [important, but foreign **policy
[choices]{.mark}** [are **not sui generis**]{.mark}, there are
[patterns]{.mark} across space and time that **[inform
decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Policymakers recognize this and
routinely draw lessons from history when making foreign policy
decisions. As noted below, policymakers in other areas such as
development and public health routinely rely on broader, more general
studies to craft policy. And, [**[broader scholarship]{.mark}** can
**[improve]{.mark}** foreign [policy performance]{.mark}, as [evidenced
by the ability of]{.mark} **IR [academics]{.mark}** [to build on]{.mark}
their own [work to **predict outcomes**]{.mark}, including for example
**forecasting** the lengths of the conventional and insurgency phases of
the U.S.--Iraq conflict in the 2000s]{.underline}. But, even if one were
to accept the limits of general work, there is a growing body of
academic work that evaluates foreign policy tools as applied to a
specific country or region. These studies ask questions such as whether:
Development projects reduced insurgent violence in Afghanistan; Drone
strikes reduced insurgent violence in Pakistan; Development programs
increased civic participation and social capital in Sudan; Building cell
phone towers in Iraq reduced insurgent violence; Attempts to reintegrate
combatants into society in Burundi succeeded; Security sector reform in
Liberia increased the legitimacy of the government there; Road projects
in India reduced insurgent violence; We can understand peacekeeping's
failure in Congo; Israel's targeted assassinations reduced violent
attacks from militants. This is not by any means a dismissal of
professional intelligence work. Academics are not intelligence analysts:
They do not have access to contemporary intelligence data, nor are they
generally trained to do things like examine the latest satellite photos
of North Korean nuclear activities and make judgments about North
Korea's current plutonium production. And certainly, academic IR work
can never replace professional intelligence work. But the best policy
decisions marry timely, specific intelligence with academic work that
has a more general perspective. A third critique is that much of this
academic work on foreign policy tools is unusable by policymakers
because it is too quantitative and technically complex. Here, echoing a
point made by Erik Voeten, [[there is]{.mark} a [**danger** in **not
appreciating** the **importance** of **rigorous research
design**]{.mark}, including sophisticated [**quantitative techniques**,
for **crafting**]{.mark} **effective [policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[**Sophisticated research design** is not the enemy of effective policy,
it [is **critically necessary**]{.mark} for it]{.underline}. Certainly,
[the current academic focus on building research designs that permit
causal inference speaks exactly to what policymakers care about the
most: if implementing a certain policy will cause the desired
outcome]{.underline}. Or, put differently, [**[bad research]{.mark}**
designs [make for **bad**]{.mark} **public
[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [A classic example is school
busing]{.underline}. [In the]{.underline} 19[60s]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} early 19[70s]{.underline}, [some cities adopted
voluntary integration programs for public schools]{.underline}, in which
families could volunteer to bus their children to schools in
neighborhoods with different racial majorities. [Policymakers used the
favorable results for the voluntary programs to make the improper
inference that mandatory busing policies would also work]{.underline}.
[The result was bad public policy and violence]{.underline} in the
streets. [Sophisticated **[technical methods]{.mark}** can
[improve]{.mark} our ability to make [**causal inferences**,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} can help [[solve]{.underline}]{.mark} other
**[[empirical problems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Consider that the heart
of successful counterinsurgency is, according to U.S. military doctrine,
winning the support of the population. [Assessing whether certain
policies do win public support requires collecting opinion
data]{.underline}. A conventional method for measuring popular opinion
is the survey, but of course, individuals in insurgency-stricken areas
may be unwilling to reveal their true opinions to a survey-taker out of
fear for their personal safety. [Methodologists have crafted
sophisticated techniques for addressing this issue, improving our
ability to measure public support for the government in these
areas]{.underline}. These techniques have been used to assess better the
determinants of public support in insurgency-affected countries such as
Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. [Going forward, we will continue to
need advanced methodologies to address pressing policy
questions]{.underline}. Consider the U.S. military's commitment to
gender integration. The implementation of this commitment will be best
informed if it rests on rigorous social science that address outstanding
questions. Is there a Sacagawea effect, in which mixed gender units
engaged in counterinsurgency are more effective than male-only units?
How might mixed gender affect small unit cohesion in combat? How might
mixed gender units reduce the incidence of sexual assault, both within
the military and of assault committed by troops against civilians?
[Certainly, **other areas** of public policy understand the importance
of rigorous research design]{.underline}. [Economic and development
policy communities read the work of and employ economics
Ph.D.s.]{.underline} [[Policymakers incorporate]{.mark} the [findings
of]{.mark} sophisticated studies on policy areas such as
[**microfinance**, **gender empowerment**, and **foreign aid**]{.mark},
knowing the best policy decisions must incorporate these studies'
findings]{.underline}. Or consider public health policy. [**Lives are
literally on the line** as decision-makers must make [decisions
about]{.mark} issues such as [**vaccinations**, **nutritional
recommendations**, and **air quality**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Policymakers know they must use sophisticated technical studies
executed by epidemiologists and other public health academics to craft
the best policies]{.underline}. Critics will argue that some U.S.
policymakers remain alienated from contemporary academic IR work, with
the suggestion that if IR academics let go of an obsession with
technique, they will then be better able to connect with policymakers
and help them craft better policy. I agree that IR academics need to
find ways to communicate their results in clear, non-technical language.
But [the **[technical components]{.mark}** of the work **[need to be
there]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Stripping them out **directly
undermines**]{.mark} the ability of the research to give the
**[right]{.mark}** kinds of policy
**[recommendations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Let me conclude by noting
that I am sympathetic to the concern that IR academics should think
about the big picture as well as smaller questions, the forest of grand
strategy as well as the trees of foreign policy tools. [**IR
[academics]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} the [potential to **make real
contributions** to]{.mark} big picture
**[debates]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to think hard about the essence of
grand strategy by assembling a framework that effectively integrates
foreign policy means and ends. [The nature of the IR subfield and its
integration of political economy and security, and its ability to think
about structure as well as units, make it especially well positioned to
consider these broad questions]{.underline}. The ability of IR academics
to contribute to contemporary foreign policy debates is one of many
reasons why [political science should retain]{.underline} the subfield
of [IR and resist the temptation to replace the traditional empirical
subfields]{.underline} of IR, comparative, and American [with new
subfields of conflict, political economy, behavior, and
institutions]{.underline}. Like good carpenters, [foreign policymakers
need to know their tools]{.underline}. [[**Rigorous IR research** is the
**only way to evaluate**]{.mark} **them
[effectively]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Eurocentric

#### IR's [not intrinsically Eurocentric]{.underline} -- they need to indict [our specific studies]{.underline}, or their vague theoretical cards [just don't apply]{.underline}

Audrey **Alejandro 19**, Assistant Professor at the Department of
Methodology, London School of Economics and Political Science, "Western
Dominance in International Relations?", Routledge Publishing,
forthcoming

[Since the **1970s**]{.underline}, [a 'critical' movement has been
developing in the humanities and social sciences denouncing the
existence of]{.underline} '**[Western dominance']{.underline}** [over
the worldwide production and circulation of knowledge]{.underline}.
**[However]{.underline}**, [thirty years after the emergence of
this]{.underline} promising [agenda]{.underline} in International
Relations (IR), [this discipline has **not** experienced a]{.underline}
major [shift]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} volume [offers a
counter-intuitive and original contribution to the understanding of the
global circulation of knowledge]{.underline}. **[[In contrast to the
literature]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it argues that [[the
internationalisation of social sciences]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
designated 'Global South' [**[is not conditioned]{.underline}** [by the
existence of a presumably 'Western dominance']{.underline}]{.mark}.
Indeed, [[although discriminative practices such as Eurocentrism]{.mark}
and gatekeeping [**exist**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[their existence
**does not lead to a unipolar**]{.mark} **[structuration of IR]{.mark}
internationalisation**]{.underline} [[around 'the
West']{.mark}.]{.underline} [Based on these empirical
results]{.underline}, [this book reflexively questions the role of
critique in the **(re)production of the social and political
order.**]{.underline} Paradoxically, [[the anti-Eurocentric]{.mark}
critical [discourses]{.mark} **[reproduce the very Eurocentrism they
criticise]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This book offers methodological
support to address this paradox by demonstrating how [one can
use]{.underline} discourse analysis and [reflexivity to produce
innovative results and decentre oneself from the vision of the
world]{.underline} one has been socialised into.

#### IR scholarship is not American-centric -- it's a complex field with people from backgrounds all over the world

Benign Hegemony," International Studies Review (2016) 18, 147--169,
DKP\]

[[It is often said]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the]{.underline}
international relations ([[IR)]{.mark} scholarly community [is too
American-centric]{.mark}]{.underline} and needs to broaden its
horizons**[. [I disagree.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In the mid-1970s,
Stanley [[Hoffmann called IR an "American social science." That
label]{.mark} was appropriate then, and it [is still appropriate]{.mark}
today]{.underline} especially with regard to the all important ideas and
theories that dominate discourse in our discipline. **[[This situation
is not likely to change]{.underline}]{.mark}** significantly [anytime
soon and **[for entirely legitimate and defensible
reasons.]{.mark}**]{.underline} To be clear, [the issue here is not
about the makeup of the IR scholarly community as there is an abundance
of scholars from outside the borders]{.underline} of the United States
who study world politics. It is clear from just perusing the program for
the International Studies Association's annual conference that [**[IR
scholars live in a global village]{.mark}.** This
diversity]{.underline}---which is all for the good---[is likely to grow
with time]{.underline} as increasing numbers of young people from around
the world go to college and study IR. In short, American scholars do not
have great influence because of their numbers. Nor do Americans dominate
the field because the subjects that concern them are privileged over the
interests of scholars from other countries. In fact, [**[the issues that
concern IR students are the same]{.mark}** almost [**everywhere.**
Nuclear proliferation, democracy promotion, and economic
interdependence]{.mark}]{.underline}---to pick just three topics among
many---hardly concern the United States alone or even just the great
powers. [[Virtually every country cares about those subjects]{.mark} and
countless others,]{.underline} although they might approach them in
different ways. [North Korea and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, for example, [might think differently
about]{.underline} the virtues of nuclear [prolif]{.underline}eration,
[but both care greatly about the issue. [It is in the realm of
methods]{.mark}]{.underline}, and especially theory, [[where US scholars
dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} the study of IR. [The analytical
frameworks and causal stories that researchers from other countries
employ in their work are associated in large part with American
academia.]{.underline} For instance, [the key names associated with
the]{.underline} three most [important bodies of IR
theory]{.underline}---constructivism, liberalism, and realism---[are
closely tied to scholars at American universities. And [the few
influential IR theorists who do not teach at US universities are mostly
British]{.mark}]{.underline} or are at least associated with British
schools. Thus, one could argue that it is really Anglo-Saxon scholars
who dominate the IR discourse. The importance of theory for studying
international politics cannot be underestimated as there is no way we
can make sense of the infinitely complicated world around us without
theories. The fact that the United States is home to the world's leading
theorists is what allows its IR community to control the commanding
heights of the field. The dominance of American-based scholars is
reinforced by the fact that they have developed a rich variety of
theories that are very useful for comprehending the politics of the
international system. This means, however, there is not a lot of room
for new theories or even major twists on existing theories. To be sure,
this is not to say that there is no room for new theories, especially
when it comes to middle-range theories. Plus, there is always room to
refine existing theories. Still, there are limited opportunities in 2015
for scholars outside the United States---as well inside it---to develop
wholly new theories. If this were 1945, the situation would be markedly
different. The extent to which American theories cast a giant shadow
over the IR field is reflected in how undergraduate and graduate
students outside of the United States talk and think about international
politics. [Wherever I speak abroad]{.underline}--- regardless of the
subject---[the comments and questions from students are virtually the
same ones I get when I talk on American campuses.]{.underline} Indeed,
[students inside and outside of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [seem to read the same articles and books and for
the most part employ the same concepts and arguments. I might add that
as a realist[, **I feel** intellectually **more at home in Beijing than
Washington** because Chinese scholars]{.mark} and policymakers [tend to
be more sympathetic to realism than their American counterparts. So,
**when I speak in China**]{.mark}]{.underline}--- where there is a deep
fascination with American IR theories---[[**I** sometimes **start my
talks by saying, "It is good to be back among my
people."**]{.underline}]{.mark} And [I do not speak one word of Chinese,
although I do speak the same language]{.underline} as my Chinese
interlocutors [when we talk about]{.underline} the basic realities of
[international politics.]{.underline} American dominance in IR is
reinforced by the fact that many talented undergraduates from around the
world come to the United States for graduate training, where they are
taught that the theories and methods that dominate the intellectual
landscape on American campuses are essential tools for being a
first-rate scholar. Most of them go on to have successful
careers---often not only in the United States but also in other
countries---where they purvey the ideas they learned in graduate school.
[[**One sometimes hears the argument that there is a hegemonic
discourse**]{.mark} in IR and that the Americans who control it actively
work to suppress new ideas generated by outsiders.]{.underline} In other
[words, [there would be a richer]{.underline}]{.mark} and more diverse
[[menu]{.underline} of]{.mark} IR theories [[were it not for **American
gatekeepers**]{.underline}]{.mark} policing the discourse. [**[This
claim is wrong and easy to refute.]{.mark}** For starters, just ask
yourself: where are the ideas that are being suppressed? **[Where is the
evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}that American academics have
prevented others from pushing forward new ideas about international
politics? [**[In fact, there is none]{.mark}.** And please remember that
**[we live in]{.mark} the age of [the Internet]{.mark}**, where it is
almost impossible to stop new ideas]{.underline}---particularly good
ones---from reaching a wide audience. [Beside, the scholarly world
places a high premium on creating innovative arguments, especially if
they challenge conventional wisdoms]{.underline} and even if they make
prominent scholars angry. [Finally, the American IR community is
international and liberal at its core]{.underline}, which makes it hard
to believe serious scholars in that world would be interested in
protecting a hegemonic discourse, much less be capable of organizing to
achieve that end[. Even if a few scholars played politics]{.underline}
and attempted to marginalize a novel idea they disliked, [other scholars
would intervene to promote and engage with it]{.underline}, particularly
if it shed new light on an important problem. [One might argue that
focusing on culture]{.underline}, as an explanatory variable, [would
allow non-Americans to offer new theories]{.underline} and broaden
horizons within IR. For example, a number of scholars and public
intellectuals have claimed that China has a Confucian culture, which
they maintain has had a profound influence on its past foreign policy
and will continue to do so in the future. For example, this is a key
element in Henry Kissinger's 2011 book On China, and it is clearly a
legitimate argument. [But cultural arguments of this sort have been
swishing around in American academia for decades. During the Cold
War]{.underline}, for instance, [more than a few American scholars
maintained that there was a Soviet strategic culture that mattered
greatly for explaining Moscow's behavior.]{.underline} All this is to
say that cultural arguments do not offer a new way of broadening our
intellectual vista in IR. American dominance of the IR discourse is
likely to diminish somewhat in the decades ahead as scholars from other
countries become increasingly engaged in trying to develop new theories
and refine existing ones. After all, Americans do not have a special
aptitude for doing theory, and the United States has not always ruled
the theoretical roost. [Britain and Germany dominated intellectual
discourse]{.underline} in IR [before World War II]{.underline}, and US
preeminence did not emerge until after 1945. Moreover, when Americans
got seriously involved in IR scholarship, their theories bore a
remarkable resemblance to those developed in Europe. Just think of the
profound influence of Immanuel Kant and Hans Morgenthau---both
Germans--- on IR theory in the United States. What this tells us is that
[those [**non-American IR scholars** who become leading
theorists]{.mark}]{.underline} at some future point [**[will stand on
the shoulders of American academics]{.mark}**, much the way America's
leading lights have stood on the shoulders of their European
predecessors. [This is the way scholarship
advances.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Nation State Good

and security work for poor, excluded and vulnerable people?

6\. The two faces of security -- and of peace [Security]{.underline},
especially [[state security]{.mark}, tends to be enacted in contexts of
the violently contested **political authority**]{.underline}.
[[Often]{.mark} it [is enacted through **violent
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rebranded as legitimate force. Small
wonder that some in the development community, including those who
drafted SDG 16, hesitate to use the word at all. [But [**although**
security is]{.mark} a **[deeply disputed]{.mark}** idea, [it is]{.mark}
also a **[highly]{.mark} [necessary]{.mark}** one]{.underline}.
[Security functions simultaneously as an analytical construct, as a
**frame for policy** and as a **moral narrative**]{.underline}. It is
distinct from the equally ambiguous if less contentious concept of
peace. Yet, at the same time, [it is]{.underline} often seen as
[**essential** [to the preservation of **peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Most of the things that international decision-makers, political and
security elites and development practitioners do in security's name are
supposed to protect the safety and welfare of people in a world of
multiple challenges and threats. However, [there is a tendency to slide
from **global**, to **national**, to **citizen** and to human security
and back again, without enough serious reflection on how they
**interconnect**]{.underline} and on where tensions and contradictions
lie hidden. Development agencies have too often plunged into security
policies and programmes, without a clear understanding of where they
might lead, who would benefit and how they might go wrong. The
ambiguities stem in part from a deep-seated tension between two distinct
visions of security (summarised in Table 3), which interconnect, yet are
in deep tension with eachother. [On the **one hand**]{.underline},
[[security]{.mark} can be seen as a process of political and social
ordering, aiming to reduce violence and keep the peace]{.underline}. As
such it is territorially organised and kept in place globally as well as
nationally through the authoritative discourses and practices of power,
including socially sanctioned violence. [[It connects to]{.mark}
conceptions of what Galtung termed '[negative peace']{.mark}: the
[ending]{.mark} of overt [violence, without]{.mark} necessarily
**[transforming]{.mark} the [conditions]{.mark}** giving rise to this
violence]{.underline} [or attending to the **quality** of the
**subsequent peace**]{.underline}. In this view security is a public
good delivered in principle by states, much like official or
donor-driven development.29 Yet in a world where states and indeed the
international order face sustained challenges, security is often kept in
place also through alternative nonstate or 'hybrid' networks of violence
and protection.30 Moreover, security is far from being an unalloyed
public good. In principle, it is equally shared and socially inclusive,
even if in practice it is anything but, especially at the insurgent
margins where insecurity is most acute. For [in practice [it
protects]{.mark} **socially [embedded power]{.mark}**, established
property relations and **social privilege** -- and reinforces global,
national and local **inequalities**]{.underline}. [[On the **other
hand**, security can be seen]{.underline}]{.mark} (in the vernacular)
[[as an **entitlement**]{.mark} **of citizens**]{.underline} and more
widely human beings [[to **social peace**]{.mark} and [**protection from
violence**,]{.mark} [abuses of **rights**]{.mark} and [**social
injustice**, along with]{.mark} other [**existential risks** such as
**famine** or **disease**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It connects to]{.mark}
the idea of '**[positive peace']{.mark}**, including **transformations**
in the social conditions giving rise to violence and [deepening]{.mark}
the **[relationships]{.mark} between states and** their
**citizens**]{.underline}. The vernacular understandings, day-to-day
experience, resilience and agency of the people and groups who are
'secured' and 'developed' are in this view the touchstone by which to
evaluate security and violence reduction[. Most [people **fall
back**]{.mark} up[on]{.mark} their **[social identities]{.mark}** -- as
women and men, members of families, clans, castes, [ethnic
groups]{.mark}, sects, religions and [nationalities]{.mark} -- [to
navigate]{.mark} their [social worlds]{.mark}, [to **respond to
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline} and violence and (sometimes) to
organise for violence. At the same time, [[these]{.mark} [**identities**
are **written into**]{.mark} the **[structures of]{.mark} power and
[inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [being [deployed to **establish
hierarchies of citizenship**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **patterns of
[exclusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ensuring that security is inclusive
and not simply the security of particular groups or the property of the
well-armed, powerful and wealthy, is fraught with difficulty and must be
negotiated at multiple levels. 'Security in the vernacular' is the term
used here rather than the interlinked but distinct concepts of 'human
security' and of 'citizen security' popularised by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank,31 which fit in the
conceptual toolboxes of development practitioners, humanitarian agencies
and intervention forces. Both human and citizen security have come under
criticism for 'securitising' development by framing poverty, exclusion
and vulnerability through security lenses, and thus paving the way for
military interventions in the affairs of fragile states.32 '[**[Security
in the vernacular]{.mark}'** paves the way for more precise and detailed
empirical scrutiny of how security and plays out in particular local and
national contexts. It highlights the experience and social agency of
those who are 'secured'. And it [underscores]{.mark} the [transformative
potential]{.mark} of security as an **entitlement**]{.underline}, [which
can be **actively claimed** by those who **challenge** the **deeply
rooted legacies** of **insecurity**, **exclusion** and
**injustice**]{.underline}. Both these faces of security have their
underside, most obviously the first. 'Seeing like a state' even with the
best of intentions can lead to the interests of citizens being
sacrificed to an unbending vision of national security or of top-down
development (as even in Nyerere's Tanzania).33 It is also open to abuse
-- for instance, to prop up authoritarian regimes; to advance the
interests of predatory elites; to impose exclusionary economic and
social policies; to justify state secrecy and surveillance of citizens;
or to justify the hegemonies and military adventurism of major world
powers. And it tends to be closely if complexly related to 'seeing like
a corporation', most obviously in enclave economies, where privatised
security arrangements in protected enclaves may indeed destabilise or
weaken the state.34 The [**deformations** of **security in the
vernacular** tend to be more hidden]{.underline}, but no less damaging
-- for instance, [the submission of minorities and refugees to campaigns
of exclusion and violence by populist majorities]{.underline}; [forms of
**popular justice** that **violate the rights**]{.underline}, dignity
and safety of supposed perpetrators; or grass roots endorsement of
'traditional' or customary institutions, which perpetuate gender and
other inequities. Moreover, local-level insecurities can persist or even
worsen, when a state, like India or Brazil, is considered to be stable,
or a region or locality is considered to be secure. Neither face of
security can be considered without the other. The relationship between
them is utterly crucial. The capacity of states to protect their
citizens is at the basis of the social contract.35 That is, [the rights
and security of citizens]{.underline} and people [are the bedrock of
state and international security -- or at least they **should
be**]{.underline}. But [these entitlements cannot be protected without
some kind of **social order**]{.underline}, however achieved. [And how
and by whom social order is assured are both **affairs of governance**
and **vital concerns** for **everyone** who lives under the **leaky
umbrella** of **political authority**]{.underline}. **[[Political
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[durable
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the]{.underline} [**[rule of
law]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[effective and
[accountable security apparatuses]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[are]{.underline}**]{.mark} not just **[[desirable]{.mark} attributes
of states]{.underline}** but are also in many respects conditions of the
security of people. However, [[they]{.mark} **[come at a
price]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not just in taxes, but also [[because of
the need for **constant vigilance**]{.mark} to ensure that those charged
with delivering security do not ignore or still worse violate the
entitlements of those they are supposed to protect]{.underline}.

successive administrations' "critical takes" on China fuel anti-Asian
violence. This narrative, which weaponizes Asian American vulnerability
to shield Beijing from international criticism, is as dangerous as it is
fraudulent.

First of all, let's be clear that [there is no bipartisan political
rhetoric targeting Asia]{.underline}, a continent of nearly 50 nations.
[[Conflating]{.mark} Asia with China [is the geopolitical]{.mark}
equivalent of assuming all Asians are Chinese, precisely the **kind of
[racial lumping that the writers]{.mark} themselves sensibly [caution
against]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

To be sure, criticism of the Chinese government by policymakers in
Washington has escalated in recent years. But [[the]{.mark} overwhelming
volume of the [rhetoric]{.mark} targeting Beijing [has been]{.mark}
prompted [not]{.mark} by [abstract]{.mark} geopolitical competition
[but]{.mark} by [tangible grievances, including China's **genocide**
]{.mark}**in Xinjiang**]{.underline}, intensifying
**[[repression]{.mark} in Tibet, [dismantling of democracy]{.mark} in
Hong Kong [and]{.mark} sweeping [crackdown]{.mark} on Chinese civil
society]{.underline}**. [[Some of Beijing's]{.mark} [harshest critics
are]{.mark} Asian Americans]{.underline}. [[Uyghur refugees]{.mark},
Hong Kong democrats, [Chinese dissidents and Tibetan exiles]{.mark} such
as myself]{.underline}, whose communities back home reel under Beijing's
boot, [are **[urging Congress to censure China]{.mark} for its
crimes**]{.underline}. [[Asking lawmakers]{.mark} of conscience [to hold
their tongue]{.mark} on Beijing's genocide to supposedly prevent racial
violence here [is]{.mark} to set up [a **false trade-off between Asian
American safety and Uyghur lives**]{.mark}, both of which should be
treated as **nonnegotiable**.]{.underline}

Moreover, **[[there is no research-based evidence that American
lawmakers']{.mark} legitimate [criticism]{.mark} of Beijing [has a
causal effect on violence]{.mark} against Asians]{.underline}**. In
fact, [[Washington's political]{.mark} rhetoric [has been rising]{.mark}
steadily [over the]{.mark} past [half decade]{.mark}, during which
[Beijing built]{.mark} the **Uyghur internment [camps]{.mark}**[,
demolished]{.mark} **Hong Kong's [democracy]{.mark}** [and chipped away
at]{.mark} the **[l]{.mark}iberal [i]{.mark}nternational
[o]{.mark}rder**]{.underline}. **[[Anti-Asian attacks remained
rare]{.underline}]{.mark}** [during this whole period, [soaring only
when the pandemic hit]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If China had contained
covid]{.underline}-19 within its borders, or if the United States had
succeeded in keeping it out, [no amount of congressional criticism
against Beijing would have made us afraid to ride the subway at
night.]{.underline}

[[market reforms]{.mark}, the Chinese people **[experienced]{.mark} the
[fastest increase so far in]{.mark} their [standard of
living.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **[must compete with
China]{.mark}**]{.underline} and **[[confront the]{.mark} Chinese
[government]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}on a range of issues
[[while]{.mark} simultaneously **[combating]{.mark} the rise of
anti-Asian [racism]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}at home.
[[These]{.mark} two missions [are **not at odds** ]{.mark}**with each
other**]{.underline}, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would have
you believe. In fact, [they]{.underline} must [go **hand in
hand**]{.underline}. In Alaska last weekend, Chinese government leaders
sought to stoke our country's racial divisions, accusing the United
States of having "slaughtered" African Americans, to deflect criticism
over Beijing's mass atrocities against its Uyghur Muslim population.
Meanwhile, [CCP [propaganda]{.mark} outlets have been using the
killing]{.underline} last week in the Atlanta area [of]{.underline}
eight [innocent]{.underline} people (six of them [Asian]{.underline})
[to cast aspersions on those who are condemning the Chinese government's
atrocities]{.underline}. [Beijing's goal is to **[conflate]{.mark} and
confuse**]{.underline} two **[related but [distinct
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}**: [[challenging]{.mark} the [Chinese
government and]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}the need to [[fight
racism]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United States. But [their gambit
amounts to **[present]{.mark}ing [a false choice]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}between doing one or the other.]{.underline} "[It is part of a
broader strategy that the Chinese Communist Party is enacting to
**undermine our democracy**]{.underline}," Rep. Stephanie Murphy
(D-Fla.) told me in an interview. "So [when you see them creating that
**[false equivalency]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}. . . [it is their
way to **[sow discord]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}in our society,
because [they understand when we are not united, we are
weaker]{.underline} in leading the world [in confronting]{.underline}
their [bad behavior]{.underline}." Murphy, a former Pentagon official
who came to the United States as a child refugee from Vietnam, said that
the use of racist language by former president Donald Trump and other
GOP officials plays into the CCP's hands. Yet at the same she emphasized
that [U.S. [leaders have to]{.mark} be able to
**[speak]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}honestly and **[[critically
about the CCP's]{.mark} negative [behaviors]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
including its mishandling of the covid-19 pandemic. The rise of racism
against Asian Americans not only hurts the United States' ability to
deal with China, but also it harms efforts to make common cause with our
regional allies and partners such as Japan, South Korea and Vietnam.
Those governments' ability to join the United States in confronting
China is hurt when members of their diaspora communities are mistreated
in the United States. "[We]{.underline} have to be able to [[make
a]{.mark} **very clear [distinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}that
[[our]{.mark} adversary and [competitor is the **C**]{.mark}**hinese
[C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty, [not]{.mark} the [Chinese
people]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and certainly **[not]{.underline}** the
**[Asian Americans]{.underline}** who live here and who have contributed
so much to this country," Murphy said. "When we attack Americans of
Asian descent, we attack ourselves." [Some]{.underline} American
commentators [argue that]{.underline} the [effort to confront the
Chinese government's behavior]{.underline} has [fueled]{.underline} the
staggering rise in [hate and violence directed at Asians and Asian
Americans]{.underline} in the United States. [It's certainly true that
Trump's racist rhetoric]{.underline} regarding the coronavirus fueled
hate and [conflated the two issues, tragically]{.underline}. And U.S.
government efforts to confront CCP influence operations in our country
have at times unfairly targeted people of Chinese origins. Such
targeting of Asians and Asian Americans makes us weaker at home and
abroad. **[We must]{.underline}** learn from, **[not repeat,
examples]{.underline}** from history [when U.S. foreign policy
negatively affected American minorities]{.underline}, including the mass
internment of U.S. citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent during
World War II and the mistreatment of Arab and Muslim Americans after
9/11. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), the son of Indian immigrants, told me
that **[the United States has to out-compete China without replicating
the paradigms]{.underline}** of the Cold War. But, he said, [we
must]{.underline} also **[stand up to the authoritarian and repressive
model the Chinese government]{.underline}** is putting forward [without
ceding our moral authority]{.underline}. "[That has to be the
balance]{.underline}, enhance America's strategic interest but
**[clearly reject provocative rhetoric]{.underline}** that's intended to
play to a base," he said. "[There's a way to **[frame our]{.mark} moral
[position as]{.mark} a liberal democracy**]{.underline} . . . [without
coming]{.underline} off as [demonizing an entire
civilization]{.underline} in a way that hurts Chinese or Chinese
Americans." [Khanna and]{.underline} Rep. Mike [Gallagher]{.underline}
(R-Wis.) have co-sponsored a bill, the Endless Frontier Act, to revamp
the National Science Foundation to **[try to [out-compete China through
tech]{.mark}nological innovation]{.underline}**. Senate Majority Leader
Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) are
cooperating on companion legislation in the Senate. These efforts will
be a major test of whether bipartisan cooperation on the China challenge
is possible. **[[It's not the drive to confront China that is
fueling]{.mark} hate and [racism]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}against
Asians in America. Political [opportunists are abusing that effort by
fueling bigotry]{.underline} to score political points. This makes a
unified strategy to confront the Chinese government only more difficult
to achieve. In fact, addressing racism at home is crucial to winning the
competition with China in the long run. "[We have to be aggressive in
our policies and working with our allies]{.underline} to combat the
violations the Chinese are making, [but at the same time, **we can [hold
the CCP accountable without scapegoating]{.mark} Asian
Americans**]{.underline}," Murphy said. "And we have a responsibility to
do that."

First, it is not simply that interna- tional institutions fail to
restrain revi- sionists. In fact, membership in [interna- tional
institutions can give countries resources with which to challenge the
status quo]{.underline}. Second, [how a revisionist decides to challenge
those institutions depends on how it is positioned within
them.]{.underline} [Only revisionists that are]{.underline} mem- bers
[in]{.underline} [good]{.underline} [standing]{.underline}
[can]{.underline} use the strat- egy of [work]{.underline}ing within
institutions [to advance]{.underline} their [ambitions]{.underline}.
Finally, con- trary to the conventional wisdom, [violent revisionism is
not the norm]{.underline} in interna- tional politics. Indeed, when
revisionists unleash military attacks, it is [often a last
resort]{.underline}. Only when imperial Japan failed to achieve its
expansionist aims within existing institutions did it turn to military
force. Military aggression is a sign not of strength but of weakness.
LASHING OUT Russia, of course, has taken the path of military aggression
in its war against Ukraine. That brutal attack against democratization
and liberalism has demonstrated how-despite their recent declaration of
unity-China and Russia are in very different institutional posi- tions
and are therefore pursuing distinct revisionist strategies. [Putin\'s
Russia may be disruptive in the short term, but it is **ultimately too
weak**]{.underline} to build an alterna- tive institutional order.
Although Russia has sought access to liberal international institutions,
the country was always a bit player within them. **[As a result, it
could not rely on the existing order to negoti- ate its
demands.]{.underline}** Nor does Russia have many resources outside the
U.S.-led institutions that make up the dominant liberal order that would
allow it to exit the system. For all the talk about Russia building its
own sphere of influence, the country has been [outflanked by
NATO]{.underline} and the [E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion in
eastern Europe, and [China]{.underline} is [competing]{.underline} with
it [for influence]{.underline} in Central Asia. [Lacking]{.underline}
the [resources]{.underline} to effectively challenge the existing order
or build its own, [Russia]{.underline} has [resorted]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} disruption and [violence]{.underline}. It launches
violent military actions against its neighbors and [uses]{.underline}
political [interference]{.underline}, [propaganda]{.underline}, and
[economic]{.underline} coercion-for example, funding right-wing populist
parties in Austria and France, banning agricultural
[imports]{.underline} from the Eu, and threatening [gas]{.underline}
cutoffs-to sow division in Western polities and drive wedges between
NATO allies. Far from signaling some grand scheme, **[Russia\'s violence
is best viewed as a strategy of last resort.]{.underline}** China is
different. The good news is that [Beijing has little need to use vio-
lence,]{.underline} because its participation in the [international
order has strengthened its ability to challenge the status quo 36
without resorting to force.]{.underline} The resources provided by
membership in institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the
wTO, and the UN Security Council have allowed China to expand its global
footprint, even though they **[also constrain Beijing\'s
ambitions.]{.underline}** For supporters of the liberal order, however,
the bad news is that China has member- ship in institutions both inside
and outside that order, and it is precisely this type of position that
allows states to pursue transformative revisionism. The growing alarm
about China\'s and Russia\'s revisionism has amplified calls for the
United States to abandon its institutionalist strategy and instead
embrace traditional realpolitik. [The goal is no longer integration; it
is **deterrence**: the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[must]{.underline} [ensure]{.underline} that its military and
[alliances]{.underline} **[are strong enough to dissuade China and
Russia from using force]{.underline}** to achieve their aims. This was
the stated approach of the Trump adminis- tration. Its 2017 National
Security Strategy argued that while the United States would still \"seek
areas of coopera- tion with competitors,\" its primary aim would be to
\"deter and if necessary, defeat aggression against U.S. interests and
increase the likelihood of managing competitions without violent
conflict.\" **[But turning away from institutional engagement with
revisionist powers would be a mistake]{.underline}**. Although military
instruments remain important, the United States already holds a sizable
advantage in military power over all its rivals, and any increased
investment would matter only on the margins. And given that no major
power today wants to engage in a large-scale conventional or nuclear
war, it is doubtful that military power would be the weapon of choice in
direct international political rivalries. Revisionists will continue to
use force, but only in places where they believe the United States and
its allies are unlikely to directly counter their vio- lence.
[Washington was unable to deter Russia\'s invasion]{.underline} of
Ukraine, **[but]{.underline}** it remains [improbable that Putin will
directly attack a NATO member]{.underline}. Even in Taiwan, Beijing is
not liable to turn to force if it can avoid it. **[There is no reason to
risk escalation]{.underline}** with the United States and its Asian
allies if economic and diplomatic instruments are just as likely to
secure Chinese aims. BETTER INSIDE THE TENT Instead of abandoning
institutional integration in favor of saber rattling, Washington needs
to make better use of institutions to exert its influence and limit that
of its rivals. [Even the most hardened proponents of
realpolitik]{.underline} [concede]{.underline} that
[institutional]{.underline} cooperation is [**necessary** **to deal with
existential threats**]{.underline} such as climate change,
[nuclear]{.underline} prolifera- tion, and pandemic disease. Ensuring
that all the great powers remain firmly inte- grated in institutions
that address these collective dangers-such as the Paris climate accord
and the Nuclear Nonpro- liferation [Treaty]{.underline}-should be the
[goal]{.underline}. Beyond this, **[the United States needs to embrace a
strategy of institu- tional realpolitik.]{.underline}** To begin with,
it should abandon the idea that the purpose of international
institutions is to eliminate revisionism or expand liberal global
governance. Rather, international institutions are a tool to manage
power politics. The most straightforward and significant aim should be
to channel revisionist ambitions toward institutional forums May/June
2022 37 Stacie Goddard and away from more violent and destructive
behavior. International institutions could be designed not to stop
competition through power politics but to direct it and make it more
predictable by providing chan- nels of communication, forums for
negotiation, and clear rules about what counts as appropriate behavior.
In Ukraine, this may seem like too little, too late. But at some point,
the war will be over, and it is important to consider what will come
next. This is not to advocate another \"reset\" or a substan- tive
partnership with Russia, which must not be permitted to subjugate its
neigh- bors. The goal, instead, should be to redirect a hostile
relationship back into more predictable forums-of the kind that
stabilized U.S.-Soviet relations during the Cold War. Some might decry
this as tantamount to appeasement. To be clear, the United States and
its allies including those of Ukraine. The United States should support
similar institutions to modify China\'s actions in the South China Sea.
At a minimum, Washington should ratify the UN Convention on the Law of
the Sea to give it more legitimacy in pushing back against illegal
Chinese behavior. The United States should also try to outflank its
rivals by thinking strategi- cally about where revisionists could
mobilize support for an alternative and more illiberal international
order in the future. This is particularly important in the coming long
contest with China, in which Washington, so far, seems to be largely on
the defensive. AUKUS, the trilateral security pact with Australia and
the United Kingdom; the G-7; and the Five Eyes partnership with
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom are all designed
to shore up the United States\' security relationships. But Washington
remains strangely reluctant to engage in offensive institution build-
ing. Biden has yet to reverse his prede- cessor\'s decision to withdraw
from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, whose succes- sor institution, the
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership,
established a free-trade zone stretching from Vietnam to Australia and
encompassing around 40 percent of global GDP. The United States is also
excluded from the Regional Comprehen- sive Economic Partnership, a
regional free-trade pact that is likely to build stronger ties between
China and South- east Asian countries. Finding a way to interact with
these new institutions is critical if Washington wishes to bind itself
to its allies and partners in mean- ingful, credible, and durable ways.
Moreover, China has significantly expanded its footprint in areas that
the United States has treated as peripheral. Although originally Chinese
officials portrayed the infrastructure projects of the BRI as a
complement to the liberal economic order, Beijing has since begun to
frame them as steps in building an alternative order, or a \"community
of common destiny.\" Reforming interna- tional economic institutions to
make them more attentive to the needs of aid-recipient countries could
help outflank the BRI, which has experienced its own difficulties. For
example, the United States could use its own existing institutions-the
Millennium Challenge Corporation or the U.S. International Development
Finance Corporation-to invest in infrastructure that would 38 FOREIGN
AFFAIRS buttress the efforts of the new African Continental Free Trade
Area and stymie China\'s influence. KEEP THEM CLOSE Such reforms would
not represent a return to the order building of the 1990s. The United
States has neither the power nor the will to go back to that approach.
Indeed, institutional realpolitik should involve selective retrenchment.
Wash- ington should be willing to identify places where it overextended
at the height of U.S. primacy. It may make sense to pull back from the
globally oriented, hyper-legalized institutional structure of the wTO,
which has ben- efited countries that are not playing by its rules, such
as China. Washington should also be willing to let its regional allies
and partners take the lead in institution building. Strong regional
institutions, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the
EU, are critical to halting revisionist projects, even if they sometimes
act against the United States\' interests. The next era of great-power
competi- tion is already here, but this is not the time to be ramping up
military confron- tations and shutting down or pulling away from
international institutions. U.S. policymakers should reject the false
dichotomy that suggests that Washing- ton must choose between
realpolitik and institution building. Seeking to reinvigo- rate
international alliances and institu- tions is not evidence of a lack of
imagi- nation or a naive faith in multilateralism. Rather, it is a
tried-and-true way to play the game of great-power politics.Z\' \"Nguyen

### AT: L -- Nukes

#### Nuclear war [turns the K]{.underline}.

**Thompson, 18** -- Chicago-based creative writer. (Nicole Akoukou
Thompson, \"Why I will not allow the fear of a nuclear attack to be
white-washed\", *RaceBaitr*, 4-6-2018,
https://racebaitr.com/2018/04/06/2087/#)//ILake-MO

I couldn't spare empathy for a white woman whose biggest fear was
something that hadn't happened yet and might not. Meanwhile, [my most
significant fears were in motion: women and men **dying in
cells**]{.underline} after being wrongly imprisoned, **[choked
out]{.underline}** for peddling cigarettes, [or **shot to
death**]{.underline} during 'routine' traffic stops. I twitch when my
partner is late, worried that a cantankerous cop has brutalized or shot
him because he wouldn't prostrate himself.

As a woman of color, I am aware of the multiple types of [violence that
threaten me]{.underline} **[currently]{.underline}**---**[not
theoretically.]{.underline}** Street harassment, excessively affecting
me as a Black woman, has blindsided me since I was eleven. A premature
body meant being catcalled before I'd discussed the birds and the bees.
It meant being followed, whistled at, or groped. As an adult, while
navigating through neighborhoods with extinguished street lights, I
noticed the correlation between women's safety and street lighting---as
well as the fact that Black and brown neighborhoods were never as
brightly lit as those with a more significant white population.

I move quickly through those unlit spaces, never comforted by the
inevitable whirl of red and blue sirens. In fact, it's always been the
contrary. Ever so often, cops approach me in their vehicle's encouraging
me to "Hurry along," "Stay on the sidewalk," or "Have a good night." My
spine stiffening, I never believed they endorsed my safety. Instead, I
worried that I'd be accused of an unnamed accusation, corned by a cop
who preys on Black women, or worse.

A majority of my 50-minute bus ride from the southside of Chicago to the
north to join these women for the birthday celebration was spent reading
articles about citywide shootings. I began with a Chicago Tribute piece
titled "33 people shot, seven fatally, in 13 hours," then toppled into a
barrage of RIP posts on Facebook and ended with angry posts about police
brutality on Tumblr. You might guess, by the time I arrived to dinner I
wasn't in the mood for the "I can't believe we're all going to die
because Trump is an idiot" shit.

I shook my head, willing the meal to be over, and was grateful when the
check arrived just as someone was asking me about my hair. My thinking
wasn't all too different from Michael Harriot's 'Why Black America Isn't
Worried About the Upcoming Nuclear Holocaust." While the meal was partly
pleasant, [I departed thinking, "fear of nuclear demolition
is]{.underline} just some [white shit."]{.underline}

Sadly, that thought would not last long.

I still vibe with Harriot's statement, "[Black people have lived under
the specter of having]{.underline} our **[existence
erased]{.underline}** [on a white man's whim]{.underline} since we
stepped onto the shore at Jamestown Landing." [However, a]{.underline}
friend---a Black friend---ignited my nuclear paranoia by sharing
theories about when it might happen and who faced the greatest threat.
In an attempt to ease my friend's fear, I leaned in to listen but
accidentally toppled down the rabbit hole too. I forked through curated
news feeds. I sifted through "fake news," "actual news," and foreign
news sources. Suddenly, an idea took root: [nuclear strike
would]{.underline} **[disproportionately impact Black people, brown
people, and low-income individuals.]{.underline}**

[North Korea won't target the]{.underline} plain sight
**[racists]{.underline}** [of Portland, Oregon,]{.underline} the
violently [microaggressive **liberals** of the rural Northwest, or
the]{.underline} white-hooded **[klansmen]{.underline}** [of
Diamondhead, Mississippi.]{.underline} No, under the instruction of the
supreme leader Kim Jong-un, [North Korea will likely strike]{.underline}
**[densely populated urban areas,]{.underline}** [such as Los Angeles,
Chicago, Washington D.C., and New York City. These
locations]{.underline} stand-out as targets for a nuclear strike because
they are densely populated U.S. population centers. Attacking the heart
of the nation or populous cities [would translate to more
casualties.]{.underline} With that in mind, it's not lost on me that the
most populous cities **[in]{.underline}** the United States boast
sizeable diverse populations, or more plainly put: **[Black
populations.]{.underline}**

This shit stresses me out! There's a creeping chill that follows me, a
silent alarm that rings each time my Google alert chimes letting me know
that Donald Trump has yet again provoked Kim Jong-Un, a man who
allegedly killed his very own uncle. I've grown so pressed by the idea
of nuclear holocaust that my partner and I started gathering
non-perishables, candlesticks, a hand-crank radio, and other must-buy
items that can be banked in a shopping cart. The practice of preparing
for a nuclear holocaust sometimes feels comical, particularly when
acknowledging that there has long been a war on Black people in this
country.

Blackness is bittersweet in flavor. We are blessed with the melanized
skin, the MacGyver-like inventiveness of our foremothers, and our
blinding brightness---but the anti-blackness that we experience is also
blinding as well as stifling. We are stuck by rigged systems, punished
with the prison industrial complex, housing discrimination, pay
discrimination, and worse. We get side-eyes from strangers when we're
"loitering," and the police will pull us over for driving "too fast" in
a residential neighborhood. We get murdered for holding cell phones
while standing in our grandmother's backyard.

The racism that strung up our ancestors, kept them sequestered to the
back of the bus and kept them in separate and unequal schools still
lives. It lives, and it's more palpable than dormant. To me, this means
one thing: Trump's America isn't an unfortunate circumstance, it's a
homecoming event that's hundreds of years in the making, no matter how
many times my white friends' say, "He's not my president."

[In light of this]{.underline} homecoming, [we now flirt with
a]{.underline} **[new, larger fear of]{.underline}** a **[Black
genocide.]{.underline}** [America has always worked towards]{.underline}
**[Black eradication]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} a steady
stream of [life-threatening inequality, but]{.underline} **[nuclear
war]{.underline}** on American soil **[would be swift.]{.underline}**
And for this reason [I've grown tired of whiteness being at the center
of the nuclear conversation.]{.underline} The race-neutral approach to
the dialogue, and [a tendency]{.underline} to continue [to promote the
idea that missiles will land in suburban and rural backyards, instead of
inner-city playgrounds, is false.]{.underline}

"The Day After," the iconic, highest-rated television film in history,
aired November 20, 1983. More than 100 million people tuned in to watch
a film postulating a war between the Soviet Union and the United States.
The film, which would go on to affect President Ronald Reagan and
policymakers' nuclear intentions, shows the "true effects of nuclear war
on average American citizens." The Soviet-targeted areas featured in the
film include Higginsville, Kansas City, Sedalia, Missouri, as well as El
Dorado Springs, Missouri. They depict the destruction of the central
United States, and viewers watch as full-scale nuclear war transforms
middle America into a burned wasteland. Yet unsurprisingly, the
devastation from the attack is completely white-washed, leaving out the
more likely victims which are the more densely populated (Black) areas.

[Death tolls would be high for white populations]{.underline}, yes,
[but]{.underline} large-scale [losses of Black and brown folks
would]{.underline} **[outpace that]{.underline}** number, [due to
placement and poverty.]{.underline} That number would [be pushed higher
by limited access to]{.underline} premium [health care, wealth, and
resources. The effects of radiation]{.underline} sickness, burns,
compounded injuries, and malnutrition [would throttle Black and brown
communities]{.underline} and would mark us **[for
generations.]{.underline}** It's for that reason that we have to do more
to foster disaster preparedness among Black people where we can. [Black
people deserve the space to explore]{.underline} **[nuclear
unease,]{.underline}** [even if we have competing threats, anxieties,
and worries.]{.underline}

The inevitable [slide towards cyber war is accelerated by the systemic
vulnerability of modern systems.]{.underline} Technical [security
vulnerabilities and exploits are the common root of cyber war, cyber
espionage, and cyber crim]{.underline}e. Distinguishing cyber war from
other sorts of cyber attack is thus an important first step in any
treatment of the problem. Cyber war is over-hyped, especially in the
United States, but **[it is also a very real phenomenon]{.underline}**.
[The potential for cyber conflict is growing in tandem with our
dependence on vulnerable technology]{.underline}.

[Stuxnet provides a prime example of]{.underline} a cyber weapon, not
only because of its impact but because of the relative simplicity of
[its attack payload.]{.underline} The problem is that Stuxnet 'hype'
exaggerated the capabilities required to create an effective cyber
weapon[. Consequently, non-technical policymakers may assume that
relatively unsophisticated actors will not be able to participate in
offensive cyber war. That is wrong. **Modern systems are so riddled with
security vulnerabilities that conducting a spectacular attack is
relatively easy.**]{.underline} On the average day there are [thousands
of exploitable vulnerabilities not yet made public or
patched.]{.underline} These so-called '0day' vulnerabilities are
exploited by attackers around the
world.[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2012.742013) [The
only way to address the security problem and slow the accelerating slide
into cyber war is to build security into our systems when they are
created. Software security is a relatively new discipline that takes on
the challenge of building security in,]{.underline} and has seen real
success among multinational corporations. In general, software-security
progress is more advanced among private corporations (including
multinational banks and independent software vendors) than in the public
sector, which lags years behind.

The conceptual conflation of cyber war, cyber espionage, and cyber crime
into a three-headed cyber Cerberus perpetuates fear, uncertainty and
doubt. This has made the already gaping policy vacuum on cyber security
more obvious than ever before.

Of the three major cyber security concerns in the public eye, cyber
crime is far more pervasive than cyber war or espionage. And yet it is
the least commonly discussed among policymakers. Cyber crime is already
commonplace and is growing: 285 million digital records were breached in
2008 and 2011 boasted the second-highest data loss total since
2004.[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2012.742013)

**[Though economic calculations vary widely and are difficult to make,
cyber crime and data loss have been estimated to cost the global economy
at least \$1.0 trillion dollars
annually]{.underline}**.[3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2012.742013) Even
if this estimate is an order of magnitude too high[, cyber crime is
still an important problem that needs addressing. Just as consumers
flock to the Internet, s]{.underline}o do criminals. Why did Willie
Sutton, the notorious Depression-era gangster, rob banks? As he famously
(and perhaps apocryphally) put it: 'That\'s where the money is.'
Criminals flock to the Internet for the same reason. 

Cyber espionage is another prominent problem that captivates the
imagination, and is much more common than cyber war. [The highly
distributed, massively interconnected nature of modern information
systems makes keeping secrets difficult.]{.underline} It is easier than
ever before to transfer, store and hide information, [while more
information than ever before is stored and manipulated on networked
machines.]{.underline} A pen drive the size of a little finger can store
more information than the super computers of a decade ago.

[Cyber war, cyber espionage, and cyber crime all share the same root
cause: our dependence on insecure networked computer systems. The bad
news about this dependency is that cyber war appears to be dominating
the conversation among policy-makers even though cyber crime is the
largest and most pervasive problem]{.underline}. When pundits and
policymakers focus only on cyber war, the most threats emanating from
cyber crime and espionage are relegated to the background.
Interestingly, building systems properly from a security perspective
will address the cyber crime and espionage problems just as effectively
as it will address cyber war. By [building security into our systems in
the first place we can lessen the possibility of cyber war, take a bite
out of cyber crime, and deter cyber espionage all at the same
time.]{.underline}

#### Malware threats are often underestimated - effective payloads of Stux-Esque cyberattacks are unsophisticated and easily built

To bring this all home, [imagine the timer controlling the spin velocity
of a centrifuge working incorrectly. Centrifuge systems require careful
balance and exacting technical control when used to enrich uranium.
Stuxnet sabotaged this]{.underline} control, resulting in the
destruction or disabling of thousands of centrifuge units. Though the
delivery mechanism for [Stuxnet involved a number of previously unknown
0day vulnerabilities, stolen crypto credentials, and other
arcana, ***the action part of the payload itself was not very
technically sophisticated*.**]{.underline} DLL interpositioning of the
type explained above was well known in 1997. It is easy to carry out,
[and is so elementary that it is ineffective as an attack against
today\'s online gaming
systems]{.underline}.[[20]{.underline}](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2012.742013) Put
another way, most modern control systems are so poorly designed from a
security perspective that they are vulnerable to attacks devised over 15
years ago. 

[Why is cyber war therefore inevitable? Because effective payloads of
the Stuxnet variety are easily built.]{.underline} It [**does not take
nation-state resources to create an effective cyber war payload.**
Unless and until we eradicate systemic security vulnerabilities in the
systems we depend on, they will continue to be attacked]{.underline}.
The relative ease with which an attack can be made levels the cyber
playing field, [allowing even cyber activists to do real and permanent
damage.]{.underline}

#### [Even]{.underline} if our threats are inflated, that's [good]{.underline}, securitizing them is the [best way]{.underline} to build trust and avoid extinction---otherwise, [governmental collapse]{.underline}

When sounding the alarm over cyberthreats, policymakers and analysts
have typically employed a vocabulary of conflict and catastrophe. As
early as 2001, James Adams, a co-founder of the cybersecu- rity firm
iDefense, warned in these pages that cyberspace was \"a new inter-
national battlefield,\" where future military campaigns would be won or
lost. In subsequent years, U.S. defense officials warned of a
\"cyber-Pearl Harbor,\" in the words of then Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta, and a \"cyber 9/11,\" according to then Homeland Security
Secretary Janet Napolitano. In 2015, James Clapper, then the director of
national intelligence, said the United States must prepare for a \"cyber
Arma- geddon\" but acknowledged it was not the most likely scenario. In
response to the threat, officials argued that [cyberspace should be
understood as a \"domain\" of conflict,]{.underline} with \"[key
terrain]{.underline}\" that the [United States needed]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} take or [defend]{.underline}. The 20 years since
Adams\'s warning have revealed that **[cyberthreats and cyberattacks are
hugely consequential]{.underline}**- but not in the way most predictions
suggested. Spying and theft in cyber- JACQUELYN SCHNEIDER is a Hoover

AFFAIRS space have garnered peta-, exa-, even zettabytes of sensitive
and proprietary data. Cyber-enabled information opera- tions have
**[threatened elections]{.underline}** and [incited]{.underline}
[mass]{.underline} social [movements]{.underline}. Cyberat- tacks on
businesses have [cost]{.underline} hundreds of
**[billions]{.underline}** of dollars. But while the cyberthreat is real
and growing, expecta- tions that cyberattacks would create large-scale
physical effects akin to those caused by surprise bombings on U.S. soil,
or that they would hurtle states into violent conflict, or even that
what happened in the domain of cyberspace would define who won or lost
on the battlefield haven\'t been borne out. In trying to analogize the
cyberthreat to the world of physical warfare, [policymakers missed
the]{.underline} far more [insidious danger]{.underline} that
[cyber]{.underline}-[op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline}
[pose]{.underline}: how they [erode the trust people place in
markets]{.underline}, [governments]{.underline}, and even **[national
power]{.underline}**. Correctly **[diagnosing the threat is
essential]{.underline}**, in part because it [shapes]{.underline} how
states [invest]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
[cybersecurity]{.underline}. Focusing on single, potentially
catastrophic events, and thinking mostly about the possible physical
effects of cyberattacks, unduly prioritizes capabilities that will
protect against \"the big one\": large-scale re- sponses to disastrous
cyberattacks, offensive measures that produce physical violence, or
punishments only for the kinds of attacks that cross a strategic
threshold. Such capabilities and responses are mostly ineffective at
protecting against the way cyberattacks undermine the trust that
undergirds modern economies, societies, governments, and militaries. If
trust is what\'s at stake-and it has already been deeply eroded-then the
steps states must take to survive and operate in this new world are
different. [The solution to a \"cyber-Pearl Harbor\"]{.underline} t AN-
410 , .r , 40 Jacquelyn Schneider [is to do everything possible to
ensure it doesn\'t happen]{.underline}, but the way to retain trust in a
digital world despite the inevitability of cyberattacks is to build
resilience and thereby [promote confi- dence]{.underline} in today\'s
systems of commerce, governance, military power, and interna- tional
cooperation. States can develop this resilience by restoring links be-
tween humans and within networks, by strategically distributing analog
systems where needed, and by investing in processes that allow for
manual and human intervention. The key to success in cyberspace over the
long term is not finding a way to defeat all cyberattacks but [learning
how to survive]{.underline} despite the disruption and destruction they
cause. The United States has not so far experienced a \"cyber 9/11,\"
and a cyber- attack that causes immediate cata- strophic physical
effects isn\'t likely in the future, either. But Americans\' trust in
their government, their institutions, and even their fellow citizens is
declin- ing rapidly-weakening the very foun- dations of society.
[Cyberattacks prey on]{.underline} these [weak points,]{.underline}
[sowing]{.underline} [distrust]{.underline} in information, creating
[confusion]{.underline} and [anxiety]{.underline}, and
[exacerbating]{.underline} [hatred]{.underline} and
[misinformation]{.underline}. As people\'s [digital
dependencies]{.underline} [grow]{.underline} and the links among
technologies, people, and institutions become more tenuous, this
[cyberthreat]{.underline} to trust will only **[become more existen-
tial]{.underline}**. It is this creeping dystopian future that
policymakers should worry about- and **[do everything possible to
avert]{.underline}**. THE TIES THAT BIND Trust, defined as \"the firm
belief in the reliability, truth, ability, or strength of someone or
something,\" plays a [central role in economies, societies, and the
international system]{.underline}. It allows individu- als,
organizations, and states to delegate tasks or responsibilities, thereby
freeing up time and resources to accomplish other jobs, or to cooperate
instead of acting alone. It is the glue that allows complex
relationships to survive-per- mitting markets to become more com- plex,
governance to extend over a broader population or set of issues, and
states to trade, cooperate, and exist within more complicated alliance
relationships. \"Extensions of trust \... enable coordina- tion of
actions over large domains of space and time, which in turn permits the
benefits of more complex, differentiated, and diverse societies,\"
explains the political scientist Mark Warren. Those extensions of trust
have played an essential role in human progress across all dimensions.
Primitive, iso- lated, and autocratic societies function with what
sociologists call \"particular- ized trust\"-a trust of only known
others. Modern and interconnected states require what\'s called
\"generalized trust,\" which extends beyond known circles and allows
actors to delegate trust relationships to individuals, organizations,
and processes with whom the truster is not intimately familiar.
Particularized trust leads to allegiance within small groups, distrust
of others, and wariness of unfamiliar processes or institutions;
generalized trust enables complicated market interactions, com- munity
involvement, and trade and cooperation among states. The modern market,
for example, could not exist without the trust that allows for the
delegation of responsibil- ity to another entity. People trust that
currencies have value, that banks can secure and safeguard assets, and
that 24 FOREIGN AFFAIRS A World Without Trust 1ous in the form of
checks, credit cards, or loans will be fulfilled. When individu- als and
entities have trust in a financial system, wages, profits, and
employment increase. Trust in laws about property rights facilitates
trade and economic prosperity. The digital economy makes this
generalized trust even more impor- tant. No longer do people deposit
gold in a bank vault. Instead, modern econo- mies consist of complicated
sets of digital transactions in which users must trust not only that
banks are securing and safeguarding their assets but also that the
digital medium-a series of ones and zeros linked together in code-
translates to an actual value that can be used to buy goods and
services. Trust is a basic ingredient of social capital-the shared norms
and intercon- nected networks that, as the political scientist Robert
Putnam has famously argued, lead to more peaceful and prosperous
communities. The general- ized trust at the heart of social capital
allows voters to delegate responsibility to proxies and institutions to
represent their interests. Voters must trust that a repre- sentative
will promote their interests, that votes will be logged and counted
properly, and that the institutions that write and uphold laws will do
so fairly. Finally, trust is at the heart of how states generate
national power and, ultimately, how they interact within the
international system. It allows civilian heads of state to delegate
command of armed forces to military leaders and enables those military
leaders to execute decentralized control of lower- level military
operations and tactics. States characterized by civil-military distrust
are less likely to win wars, partly because of how trust affects a
regime\'s willingness to give control to lower levels of military units
in war- fare. For example, the political scientist Caitlin Talmadge
notes how Saddam Hussein\'s efforts to coup-proof his military through
the frequent cycling of officers through assignments, the restriction of
foreign travel and train- ing, and perverse regime loyalty pro- motion
incentives handicapped the otherwise well-equipped Iraqi military. Trust
also enables militaries to experi- ment and train with new technologies,
making them more likely to innovate and develop revolutionary advance-
ments in military power. Trust also dictates the stability of the
international system. States rely on it to build trade and arms control
agreements and, most important, to feel confident that other states will
not launch a surprise attack or invasion. It enables international
cooperation and thwarts arms races by creating the conditions to share
information-thus defeating the suboptimal outcome of a prisoner\'s
dilemma, wherein states choose conflict because they are unable to share
the information required for cooperation. The Russian proverb
\"Doveryai, no proveryai\"-\"Trust, but verify\"-has guided arms control
negotiations and agreements since the Cold War. In short, the world
today is more dependent on trust than ever before. This is, in large
part, because of the way information and digital technologies have
proliferated across modern economies, societies, governments, and
militaries, their virtual nature amplifying the role that trust plays in
daily activities. This occurs in a few ways. First, the rise of
automation and autonomous technolo- gies-whether in traffic systems,
finan- January/February 2022 25 Jacquelyn Schneider cial markets, health
care, or military weapons-necessitates a delegation of trust whereby the
user is trusting that the machine can accomplish a task safely and
appropriately. Second, digital informa- tion requires the user to trust
that data are stored in the right place, that their values are what the
user believes them to be, and that the data won\'t be manipu- lated.
Additionally, [digital social media]{.underline} platforms
[create]{.underline} new [trust dynamics around identity]{.underline},
privacy, and validity. How do you trust the creators of infor- mation or
that your social interactions are with an actual person? How do you
trust that the information you provide others will be kept private?
These are relatively complex relationships with trust, all the result of
users\' dependence on digital technologies and information in the modern
world. SUSPICION SPREADS All the trust that is needed to carry out these
online interactions and exchanges creates an enormous target. In the
most dramatic way, cyber-operations generate distrust in how or whether
a system operates. For instance, an exploit, which is a cyberattack that
takes advantage of a security flaw in a computer system, can hack and
control a pacemaker, causing distrust on the part of the patient using
the device. Or a micro- chip backdoor can allow bad actors to access
smart weapons, sowing distrust about who is in control of those weap-
ons. Cyber-operations can lead to distrust in the integrity of data or
the algorithms that make sense of data. [Are voter logs
accurate]{.underline}? Is that artificial- intelligence-enabled
strategic warning system showing [a real missile launch]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} is it **[a blip]{.underline}** in the computer code?
Additionally, operating in a digital world can produce distrust in
owner- ship or control of information: Are your photos private? Is your
company\'s intellectual property secure? **[Did government secrets about
nuclear weapons make it into an adversary\'s hands]{.underline}**?
Finally, cyber-operations create distrust by [manipulating social net-
works]{.underline} and relationships and ultimately deteriorating social
capital. Online personas, bots, and disinformation campaigns all
complicate whether individuals can trust both information and one
another. All these [cyberthreats]{.underline} have implications that can
[erode]{.underline} the **[foundations]{.underline}** on which markets,
socie- ties, governments, and the international system were built. The
digitally dependent economy is particularly vulnerable to degradations
of trust. As the modern market has become more interconnected online,
cyberthreats have grown more sophisticated and ubiquitous. Yearly
estimates of the total economic cost of cyberattacks range from hundreds
of billions to trillions of dollars. But it isn\'t the financial cost of
these attacks alone that threatens the modern economy. Instead, it is
how these **[persistent attacks create distrust in the
integrity]{.underline}** of the system as a whole. Nowhere was this more
evident than in the public\'s response to the ransom- ware attack on the
American oil pro- vider [Colonial Pipeline]{.underline}. In May 2021, a
criminal gang known as DarkSide shut down the pipeline, which provides
about 45 percent of the fuel to the East Coast of the United States, and
demanded a ransom, which the company ultimately paid. Despite the
limited impact of the attack on the company\'s ability to provide oil to
its customers, people 26 FOREIGN AFFAIRS A World Without Trust
[panicked]{.underline} and [flocked]{.underline} [to]{.underline} gas
[stations]{.underline} with oil tanks and plastic bags to stock up on
gas, leading to an artificial shortage at the pump. T[his kind of
distrust, and the chaos it causes, threatens the founda-
tions]{.underline} not just of the digital economy but also **[of the
entire economy]{.underline}**. The inability to safeguard intellectual
property from cybertheft is similarly consequential. The practice of
stealing intellectual property or trade secrets by hacking into a
company\'s network and taking sensitive data has become a lucrative
criminal enterprise-one that states including China and North Korea use
to catch up with the United States and other countries that have the
most innovative technology. [North Korea]{.underline} famously hacked
the pharmaceutical company Pfizer in an [attempt to steal]{.underline}
its covID-19 [vaccine]{.underline} [technology]{.underline}, and Chinese
exfiltrations of U.S. defense industrial base research has led to
[copycat]{.underline} [tech]{.underline}nological advances in aircraft
and missile development. The more extensive and sophisticated such
attacks become, the less companies can trust that their investments in
research and development will lead to profit-ul- timately destroying
knowledge-based economies. And nowhere are the threats to trust more
[existential]{.underline} than [in online banking]{.underline}. If users
no longer trust that their digital data and their money can be
safeguarded, then the entire compli- cated modern financial system could
collapse. Perversely, the [turn toward cryptocurrencies,]{.underline}
most of which are not backed by government guarantees, [makes trust in
the value of digital information all the more critical]{.underline}.
Societies and [governments]{.underline} are also [vulnerable to attacks
on trust.]{.underline} Schools, courts, and municipal governments have
all become [ransomware targets]{.underline}- whereby systems are taken
offline or rendered useless until the victim pays up. In the cross hairs
are [virtual class- rooms]{.underline}, access to judicial
[records]{.underline}, and local [emergency services]{.underline}. And
while the immediate impact of these attacks can temporarily
[degrade]{.underline} some [governance]{.underline} and social
functions, the greater danger is that over the [long term]{.underline},
a lack of faith in the integrity of data stored by gov- ernments-whether
marriage records, birth certificates, criminal records, or property
[divisions-can erode trust in the basic functions of a
society]{.underline}. Democ- racy\'s reliance on information and social
capital to build trust in institutions has proved remarkably vulnerable
to cyber- enabled information operations. [State- sponsored campaigns
that provoke questions about the integrity of gover- nance
data]{.underline} (such as vote tallies) or that [fracture
communities]{.underline} into small groups of particularized trust give
rise to the kind of forces that foment civil unrest and threaten
democracy. Cyber-operations can also **[jeopardize military
power]{.underline}**, by [attacking trust in modern
weapons]{.underline}. With the rise of digital capabilities, starting
with the **[microprocessor]{.underline}**, [states began to rely on
smart weapons,]{.underline} [networked sensors, and autonomous platforms
for their militar- ies]{.underline}. [As those militaries became more
digitally capable]{.underline}, they also became
[susceptible]{.underline} [to cyber-operations]{.underline} that
threatened the reliability and functional- ity of these smart weapons
systems. Whereas a previous focus on cyber- threats fixated on how
cyber-operations could act like a bomb**[, the true danger occurs when
cyberattacks make it difficult to trust that actual bombs will work as
expected]{.underline}**. As militaries move January/February 2022 27
Jacquelyn Schneider farther away from the battlefield through remote
operations and com- manders delegate responsibility to autonomous
systems, this [trust becomes all the more important]{.underline}. Can
militaries have faith that cyberattacks on autono- mous systems will not
render them ineffective or, worse, [cause fratricide]{.underline} or
[kill civilians]{.underline}? Furthermore, for highly networked
militaries (such as that of the United States), lessons taken from the
early information age led to doctrines, campaigns, and weapons that rely
on complex distributions of information. Absent trust in information or
the means by which it is being disseminated, militaries will be
stymied-awaiting new orders, unsure of how to proceed. Together, these
factors threaten the fragile systems of trust that [facilitate peace and
stability within the interna- tional system]{.underline}. They make
trade less likely, arms control more difficult, and states more
uncertain about one anoth- er\'s intentions. The introduction of
cybertools for [spying]{.underline}, [attacks]{.underline}, and theft
has only [exacerbated the effects of distrust. **Offensive
cyber-capabilities** are difficult to monitor,]{.underline} and the
**[lack of norms about the appropriate uses of cyber-operations makes it
difficult for states to trust that others will use
restraint.]{.underline}** [Are Russian hackers exploring]{.underline}
U.S. power networks [to launch an imminent]{.underline}
[cyberattack]{.underline}, [or are they merely probing for
vulnerabilities]{.underline}, with no future plans to use them? **[Are
U.S. \"defend forward\" cyber-operations truly to prevent attacks on
U.S. networks or instead a guise to justify offensive cyberattacks on
Chinese or Russian command-and-control systems]{.underline}**? Mean-
while, the use of mercenaries, interme- diaries, and [gray-zone
operations in cyberspace makes attribution and determining intent
harder]{.underline}, further [threatening trust]{.underline} and
[cooperation]{.underline} in the international system. For example,
Israeli spyware aiding Saudi govern- ment efforts to repress dissent,
off-duty Chinese military hacktivists, criminal organizations the
Russian state allows but does not officially sponsor-all make it
difficult to establish a clear chain of attribution for an intentional
state action. Such intermediaries also threaten the usefulness of
official agreements among states about what is appropriate behavior in
cyberspace. LIVING WITH FAILURE To date, U.S. solutions to dangers in
cyberspace have focused on the cyber- space part of the
question-deterring, defending against, and defeating cyber- threats as
they attack their targets. But these cyber-focused strategies have
struggled and even failed: cyberattacks are on the rise, the efficacy of
deterrence is questionable, and offensive ap- proaches cannot stem the
tide of small- scale attacks that threaten the world\'s modern, digital
foundations. Massive exploits-such as the recent hacks of SolarWinds\'
network management software and Microsoft Exchange Server\'s email
software-are less a failure of U.S. cyberdefenses than a symptom of how
the targeted systems were conceived and constructed in the first place.
The goal should be not to stop all cyber-intrusions but to build systems
that are able to withstand incoming attacks. This is not a new lesson.
When cannons and gunpowder debuted in Europe in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, cities struggled to survive the onslaught of the
new 28 FOREIGN AFFAIRS A World Without Trust firepower. So states
adapted their fortifications-dug ditches, built bas- tions, organized
cavaliers, constructed extensive polygonal edifices-all with the idea of
creating cities that could survive a siege, not stop the cannon fire
from ever occurring. The best fortifica- tions were designed to enable
active defense, wearing the attackers down until a counterattack could
defeat the forces remaining outside the city. The fortification analogy
invites an alternative cyberstrategy in which the focus is on the system
itself-whether that\'s a smart weapon, an electric grid, or the mind of
an American voter. How does one build systems that can con- tinue to
operate in a world of degraded trust? Here, network theory-the study of
how networks succeed, fail, and survive-offers guidance. Studies on
network robustness find that the strongest networks are those with a
high density of small nodes and mul- tiple pathways between nodes.
Highly resilient networks can withstand the removal of multiple nodes
and linkages without decomposing, whereas less resilient, centralized
networks, with few pathways and sparser nodes, have a much lower
critical threshold for degradation and failure. If economies, societies,
governments, and the interna- tional system are going to survive serious
erosions of trust, they will need more bonds and links, fewer dependen-
cies on central nodes, and new ways to reconstitute network components
even as they are under attack. Together, these qualities will lead to
generalized trust in the integrity of the systems. How can states build
such networks? First, at the technical level, networks and data
structures that undergird the economy, critical infrastructure, and
military power must prioritize resil- ience. This requires decentralized
and dense networks, hybrid cloud struc- tures, redundant applications,
and backup processes. It implies planning and training for network
failure so that individuals can adapt and continue to provide services
even in the midst of an offensive cyber-campaign. It means relying on
physical backups for the most important data (such as votes) and manual
options for operating systems when digital capabilities are unavail-
able. For some highly sensitive systems (for instance, nuclear command
and control), it may be that analog options, even when less efficient,
produce remarkable resilience. Users need to trust that digital
capabilities and net- works have been designed to gracefully degrade, as
opposed to catastrophically fail: the distinction between binary trust
(that is, trusting the system will work perfectly or not trusting the
system at all) and a continuum of trust (trusting the system to function
at some percentage between zero and 100 percent) should drive the design
of digital capabilities and networks. These design choices will not only
increase users\' trust but also decrease the incen- tives for criminal
and state-based actors to launch cyberattacks. Making critical
infrastructure and military power more resilient to cyber- attacks would
have positive effects on international stability. More resilient
infrastructure and populations are less susceptible to systemic and
long-lasting effects from cyberattacks because they can bounce back
quickly. This resilience, in turn, decreases the incentives for states
to preemptively strike an adver- January/February 2022 29 Jacquelyn
Schneider sary online, since they would question the efficacy of their
cyberattacks and their ability to coerce the target popula- tion. Faced
with a difficult, costly, and potentially ineffective attack, aggressors
are less likely to see the benefits of chancing the cyberattack in the
first place. Furthermore, states that focus on building resilience and
perseverance in their digitally enabled military forces are less likely
to double down on first-strike or offensive operations, such as
long-range missile strikes or cam- paigns of preemption. The security
dilemma-[when states that would otherwise not go to war with each other
find themselves in conflict because they are uncertain about each
other\'s inten- tions]{.underline}-[suggests]{.underline} that when
states [focus]{.underline} more [on]{.underline} [defense]{.underline}
than offense, they are **[less likely to spiral into
conflicts]{.underline}** caused by distrust and uncertainty. HUMAN
RESOURCES Solving the technical side, however, is only part of the
solution. The most important trust relationships that cyberspace
threatens are society\'s human networks-that is, the bonds and links
that people have as individuals, neigh- bors, and citizens so that they
can work together to solve problems. Solutions for making these human
networks more durable are even more complicated and difficult than any
technical fixes. Cyber- enabled information operations target the links
that build trust between people and communities. They undermine these
broader connections by creating incen- tives to form clustered networks
of particularized trust-for example, social media platforms that
organize groups of like-minded individuals or disinforma- tion campaigns
that promote in-group and out-group divisions. Algorithms and clickbait
designed to promote outrage only galvanize these divisions and decrease
trust of those outside the group. Governments can try to regulate these
forces on social media, but those virtual enclaves reflect actual
divisions within society. And there\'s [a feedback loop: the distrust
that is building online leaks out into the real world, separating people
further into groups of \"us\" and \"them]{.underline}.\" Combating this
requires education and civic engage- ment-the bowling leagues that Put-
nam said were necessary to rebuild Americans\' social capital (Putnam\'s
book Bowling Alone, coincidentally, came out in 2000, just as the
Internet was beginning to take off). After two years of a global
pandemic and a further splintering of Americans into virtual enclaves,
it is time to reenergize physical communities, time for neigh- borhoods,
school districts, and towns to come together to rebuild the links and
bonds that were severed to save lives during the pandemic. The fact is
that these divisions were festering in American communities even before
the pandemic or the Internet accelerated their consolidation and
amplified their power. The solution, therefore, the way to do this kind
of rebuilding, will not come from social media, the cEos of those
platforms, or digital tools. In- stead, it will take courageous local
leaders who can rebuild trust from the ground up, finding ways to bring
together communities that have been driven apart. It will take more
frequent disconnecting from the Internet, and from the synthetic groups
of particular- ized trust that were formed there, in order to reconnect
in person. Civic 30 FOREIGN AFFAIRS A World Without Trust education
could help by reminding communities of their commonalities and shared
goals and by creating critical thinkers who can work for change within
democratic institutions. BOWLING TOGETHER There\'s a saying that
[cyber-operations lead to death by a thousand cuts]{.underline}, but
perhaps [a better analogy is termites]{.underline}, [hidden in
the]{.underline} recesses of [foundations]{.underline}, that gradually
**[eat away at the very structures designed to support people\'s
lives.]{.underline}** The previous strategic focus on one-off,
large-scale cyber-operations led to bigger and better
cyber-capabilities, but it never addressed the fragility within the
foundations and networks themselves. Will cyberattacks ever cause the
kind of serious physical effects that were feared over the last two
decades? Will a strategy focused more on trust and resilience leave
states uniquely vulner- able to this? [It is]{.underline} of course
[impossible to say that no cyberattack will ever pro- duce large-scale
physical effects similar to those that resulted from the bombing of
Pearl Harbor.]{.underline} But it is unlikely-be- cause the nature of
cyberspace, its virtual, transient, and ever-changing character, makes
it difficult for attacks on it to create lasting physical effects.
Strategies that focus on trust and resilience by investing in networks
and relationships make these kinds of attacks yet more difficult.
Therefore, focusing on building networks that can survive incessant,
smaller attacks has a fortuitous byproduct: additional resil- ience
against one-off, large-scale at- tacks. But this isn\'t easy, and there
is a significant tradeoff in both efficiency and cost for strategies
that focus on resilience, redundancy, and persever- ance over
convenience or deterring and defeating cyberthreats. And the initial
cost of these measures to foster trust falls disproportionately on
democracies, which must cultivate generalized trust, as opposed to the
particularized trust that autocracies rely on for power. This can seem
like a tough pill to swallow, especially as China and the United States
appear to be racing toward an increasingly competitive relationship.
Despite the difficulties and the cost, democracies and modern economies
(such as the United States) must prioritize building trust in the
systems that make societies run-whether that\'s the electric grid,
banks, schools, voting machines, or the media. That means creating
backup plans and fail-safes, making strategic decisions about what
should be online or digital and what needs to stay analog or physical,
and building networks-both online and in society-that can survive even
when one node is attacked. If a stolen pass- word can still take out an
oil pipeline or a fake social media account can con- tinue to sway the
political opinions of thousands of voters, then
[cyberattacks]{.underline} will remain [too lucrative for autocracies
and criminal actors to resist]{.underline}. Failing to build in more
resilience-both technical and human-will mean that the cycle of
cyberattacks and the distrust they give rise to will **[continue to
threaten the foundations of democratic society.]{.underline}**

Security Studies, 7-16-2019,

Tragedy is largely absent from the existing normative debate on
securitization. Instead, the [debate has]{.underline} become [organized
around whether securitization is a "negative" or "positive"
concept]{.underline}. In the classic formulation, the Copenhagen School
points to how "\[n\]ational security should not be idealized. It works
to silence opposition and has given power-holders many opportunities to
exploit 'threats' for domestic purposes" (Buzan et al. 1998, 29;
Williams 2003). [Securitization has negative effects when it functions
as "a political technology that consistently favors the interests of the
powerful and enables violence and exclusion"]{.underline} (McDonald
2015, 154). Correspondingly, Wæver admits a "'bias' for
desecuritization" or de-escalation, although he quickly notes that this
is "not always better than securitization" (Wæver 2011, 469). [At the
same time]{.underline}, a number of approaches point to cases where
[securitization]{.underline} [is ethically desirable]{.underline}. In
her compelling consequentialist argument, for example, Floyd asks
"whether the consequences of, and the gains from, the securitization are
preferable relative to the consequences and gains from a politicization"
(2007, 338). Relatedly, Roe contends that "[the extent to which
securitization necessitates a lack of openness and deliberation has been
overexaggerated" and suggests it may even elicit unappreciated forms of
cooperation]{.underline} (2012, 250).

[The problem with the negative/positive debate is that it appears to
impose moral certitude where there often is none.]{.underline}
[Registering securitizing moves as clearly positive or negative can be
difficult because their effects can be mixed and temporally
distant]{.underline}. The difficulty in making this determination may
also be an indicator of the uncertainty surrounding securitizing moves.
[In the end, because the outcomes of security claims are uncertain, we
cannot know in advance whether they will lead to positive or negative
consequences.]{.underline} Instead, [we should entertain a distinctly
tragic vision of securitization that council]{.underline}s [an ethic of
self-limitation]{.underline}. The core of this tragic vision is a
recognition that the powerful allure of using security talk to "gain
control" over a situation will always be present (Wæver 1995, 54).
However, we should also recognize that this control is always illusory
because it presumes all of its effects can be predetermined. The tragedy
of securitization is that the failure to recognize how contingency
imposes limits on action lures political actors into a false sense of
certainty and the conviction that they can determine the future. This
leads to a hubristic adoption of "misplaced certainty," such as when
Vice President Dick Cheney declared in August of 2002 that "there is no
doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction" (quoted
in Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 3). A similar situation emerged when
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld subsequently claimed in November
that the Iraq conflict could be "\[f\]ive days or five weeks or five
months, but it certainly isn't going to last any longer than that"
(Esterbrook 2002). A similarly misplaced certainty is evident in US
General Stanley McChrystal's assurances to the Obama administration in
2009 that a surge in troops and resources were critical to stave off
American defeat in Afghanistan (Woodward 2009). More recently, it is
visible in President Donald Trump's 2018 assertion that he was "100
percent right" on the weaknesses of the Iran nuclear deal (CNN 2018).

Yet, tragedy cuts both ways. [Blanket opposition]{.underline} [to
securitizing moves]{.underline} can also [have unanticipated
effects]{.underline}. Ironically, the [desecuritization of an issue may
not just result in its repoliticization]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} its [disappearance from public view]{.underline} (Floyd
2010, 57--58). [Viewing security discourse as negative also underplays
how the management of threats can serve as a focal point for democratic
cooperation among different political actors]{.underline} (Roe 2012,
250, 257--58). The point is not that every security discourse and the
practices it justifies has catastrophically perverse consequences.
Instead, the goal is to highlight a sensible restraint over the limits
of seeing into the future, how this shapes choice, and the dangers of
hubris that follow. [When]{.underline} properly [adapted]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} this [constructivist context]{.underline}, the tragic
vision of [securitization can be an important tool in cultivating
prudence and restraint]{.underline} (cf. Lebow 2003, 364).

The problem with this tragic vision is that it points to
[processes]{.underline} that [are never]{.underline} entirely [in our
possession]{.underline}. [Whether in the form of background
knowledge]{.underline} (Pouliot 2008), [habits]{.underline} (Hopf 2010),
[or routines]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006), much of [social life occurs
without conscious deliberation]{.underline} and reflection. These forms
of unthinking action impair reflexivity and limit actors' ability to see
how the world might be different and thus how outcomes can be uncertain.
In some cases, this can be benign, such as the unreflexive amity between
Canada and the United States that allows these countries to "escape"
from the traditional security dilemma (Collins 2014, 572--73). But just
as practices of amity can be habitual, so too can enmity. [The hawkish
US senator may designate Iran's nuclear program as threatening because
that is what hawkish US senators do, and there is no perceived way to be
hawkish otherwise]{.underline}. The result is that the uncertainty
surrounding securitizing moves becomes concealed under an unthinking
veil of common sense. The tragedy of securitization then is not only
that political figures often exceed their limitations by ignoring how
contingency can derail securitizing moves---it is that these limitations
often never even register

This means overcoming the tragedy of securitization require a certain
degree self-reflexivity. This is similar to what Booth and Wheeler
describe as the "security dilemma sensibility," or an actor's ability
and willingness to reflect upon their actions, including one's own role
in provoking insecurity in others (2008, 7). By sensitizing leaders to
how uncertainty is an endemic feature of political life, and how their
actions can be interpreted in unintended ways, security competition can
be mitigated, at least in part (Booth and Wheeler 2008, 265). Yet, these
moments of self-awareness and [reflection]{.underline} [are
difficult]{.underline} precisely [because there are powerful forces that
demand simplicity and closure: namely our desire for a stable sense of
self or what is widely referred to as ontological security]{.underline}
(Mitzen 2006). [Reflecting on the uncertainty of international politics
can erode one's sense of identity and agency]{.underline}, [ultimately
leading to a "deep, incapacitating state of not knowing how to get by in
the world"]{.underline} (Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 29). Booth and
Wheeler's security dilemma sensibility may have the laudable goal of
alerting leaders to the role of uncertainty in political life, but this
confronts the problem that many would prefer that it remain hidden.

The consequence is that this tragic aspect of the securitization dilemma
takes on an intractable character. Either unwilling or unable to "know
one's limits," as Herz would say (1950, 179), the role of uncertainty
becomes hidden and security claims appear as a reliable strategy for
control and influence. Like the classic realist dilemma, the
securitization dilemma is pervasive because it is often invisible. The
compelling need for a logic of selflimitation---of a careful and
reflective use of security language and how it can be derailed by
contingency--- is obscured because of an aversion to
recognizinguncertainty. It is this specter of a need for reflection and
restraint that may not be realized, I suggest, which demands that we
rethink the role of the analyst in provoking reflexivity among
power-holders.

Conclusion: Rethinking the Role of the Analyst

Motivated by the absence of unintended and perverse consequences in
constructivist theorizing of security, this article has pursued a
reconceptualization of the security dilemma. Viewing the dilemma as a
logic of limitation shaped by choice, uncertainty, and tragedy, the
argument focuses on transposing this logic to the constructivist context
of securitization theory. By showing how the choice to engage in the
social construction of threats is complicated by uncertainty and the
tragic failure to recognize one's own limits, the dilemma analytic helps
us to understand how securitization can be both a potent instrument for
mobilization, as well as a volatile source of unpredictability.
Moreover, this conceptual lens lays the foundation for an ethical
imperative of self-limitation among securitizing actors---albeit one
made difficult given the desire for simplicity and closure. Far from a
rebuke of constructivist theorizing, the argument shows that taking the
social character of security seriously means appreciating how political
claims are always vulnerable to being derailed by different types of
contingency.

This reconstructive move has important implications for studying the
social construction of security. First, while the initial influence of
realism on securitization theory is well-documented (Floyd 2010; Gad and
Peterson 2011), few attempts have been made to show how engaging with
these realist roots can yield new insights.22 Here, the reconstruction
of the security dilemma demonstrates how [returning to realist themes
can yield a fresh insights]{.underline}. Second, the argument pushes
scholars studying securitization to expand their universe of outcomes
beyond the reductive binary of success and failure and to consider cases
of perverse and unintended consequences. Not only are these outcomes
relatively common, they undercut the prevailing image of securitization
as a reliable technology of control. Third, the securitization dilemma
shows why uncertainty is more of an enduring problem for social action
than constructivists typically acknowledge. Contra earlier arguments
where learning and socialization effectively mitigate the problem of
uncertainty (Wendt 2006, 208--9), this perspective stresses how
contingency means that social acts like securitizing moves can have
unpredictable effects.

The most important result of this reconstruction, however, may be in how
taking the tragic element of the dilemma seriously reorders the
political role of the analyst. [Rather than assessing]{.underline} the
validity of [a particular security discourse]{.underline}, [or exposing
its socially constructed nature]{.underline}, [this
perspective]{.underline} asks the analyst to [provoke]{.underline}
[reflexivity]{.underline} [on behalf of power-holders over the risks
associated with securitization]{.underline}. While this entails a bias
toward deescalation and desecuritization, unlike other approaches this
is [not achieved through]{.underline} overt references to
[an]{.underline}y liberal, democratic, or [emancipatory
ideal]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, [it is packaged for
power-holders as a strategy of self-preservation]{.underline}. Here, the
analyst presents the move to securitize as a risk-laden and potentially
self-defeating strategy. The analyst points to a series of precedents
showing how such a strategy can produce perverse consequences: how
today\'s tough talk can become tomorrow\'s liability; how audiences can
interpret threatening messages in unexpected ways; and how today\'s
framing of security can lead to perverse consequences tomorrow. By
foregrounding the problem of uncertainty, the analyst works to
accentuate and impress upon actors the dilemmatic quality of
securitizing moves.

Yet, the problem with presenting the move to securitize as a risk is
that it may become accepted. Ironically, framing an escalation in enmity
as possible but dangerous is precisely what may legitimize such a move
in the eyes of risk-insensitive actors. This is Huysmans' (2002) now
familiar normative dilemma of writing security. The indeterminacy of
language means that political actors may interpret advice in
unpredictable ways. Frustratingly, this may include the precise opposite
of the analyst\'s intention. This situation is likely inescapable, but
it may be mitigated. What I suggest is that analysts should strive to
cultivate a deeper subjectivity of risk sensitivity, comparable to Booth
and Wheeler\'s security-dilemma sensibility, among political actors.

Key to this argument is how visions of the future satisfy the human
desire for certainty. As Berenskoetter argues, "visions depicting the
self in an imagined future order serve as anxiety controlling
mechanisms" (2011, 654). Visions of the future inoculate actors against
the anxiety of uncertainty by providing a narrative of where they are
going and how to get there. Indeed, normative debates on securitization
are already loaded with such visions. The impulse to securitize is
underpinned by a utopian future where the security frame can finally
mobilize a response to an otherwise intractable problem. Conversely, the
impulse to desecuritize is sustained by a dystopian future defined by
unrestrained authoritarian politics. A tragic vision of the future does
something different: it presents a future where the only thing we can
know decisively is that it is indeterminate and attempts to conclusively
control it are vulnerable to failure. The very recognition of
fundamental limits on human freedom (Steele 2007, 281--82) becomes
transformed into a source of ontological security. This tempers the
human need for cognitive closure by reconfiguring it into what Herz
understood as a "fundamentally humble posture toward the value and
precariousness of life" (Sylvest 2008, 442). [An actor with a greater
sensitivity to indeterminacy may still pursue securitizing moves, but
with a cautious awareness that they are volatile acts best pursued
sparingly]{.underline}. [The analyst does not simply educate political
leaders by pointing to the indeterminacy of the world; she seeks to make
political subjects more sensitive toward it by crafting visions of a
precarious future.]{.underline}

Finally, this tragic vision cannot, and should not, escape its own need
for reflexivity. Its scholarly proponents need to engage in their own
process of self-reflection, focusing on how their knowledge and
interests are themselves historically situated. The ethic of restraint
is a value, and not necessarily the value for all historical
circumstances. A recognition of the social construction of security
"facts" must be sobered by a recognition of the social construction of
security "values" (Hamati-Ataya 2012, 685).

New Dual Framework," Uluslararasi Iliskiler, 7-1-2020,
https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/1228409

[Despite its strengths and popularity in the last 20 years,
Securitization Theory has **several limitations**, some of which have
already been identified by different scholars]{.underline}. [The most
criticized aspect is its focus on speech acts]{.underline}.16 According
to McDonald, the theory over-emphasizes speech acts while neglecting
other processes or means for communication, such as images and other
visual representations like videos, which also play a significant role
in the process.17 As Möller notes, "[language is only one of the (albeit
the most central) means, through which meaning is
communicated]{.underline}". 18 Moreover, Williams emphasizes the
importance of images by stating that: "Security policies today are
constructed not only with the question of their linguistic legitimation
in mind; they now are increasingly decided upon in relation to
acceptable image-rhetorics." 19 [Addressing these criticisms, several
studies have examined the impact of other means of communication during
the securitization process.]{.underline} 20 In line with this, the dual
framework that is introduced in this article also takes different means
of communication into account in addition to speech acts.

In addition to images and other visual representations, Paris School
[scholars also emphasize the role of the practices of security
professionals,21 arguing that these play a more crucial role than
**discursive practices** in constructing security issues]{.underline}.22
That is, rather than the magical power of speech acts, it is the
institutionalizations and routinizations through repetitions of security
practices that produce security issues. 23 [Moreover, unlike the
Copenhagen School, scholars of the Paris School also focus on the
insecuritizing consequences of the process of securitization by asking
what security does rather than what security is.24 In this way, they
also inquire and focus on the threats that ordinary people face, like
the Welsh School does, with its Emancipatory Security
approach]{.underline}.25 However, the Paris School is also limited since
it overemphasizes micro-level practices and ignores macro-level
decisionmaking with its bottom-up framework.26 [My dual framework
borrows insights from the approach of the Paris School as it takes the
practices of security professionals into account without ignoring the
discursive impact of speech acts of macro-level decision-makers.
Moreover, it also focuses on the insecuritizing consequences of
securitization.]{.underline}

[Another significant limitation of Securitization Theory is the
**inadequate analysis** of the audience]{.underline}. According to
Thierry Balzacq, the role of the audience is underspecified because of
Wæver's reliance on John L. Austin's language theory.27 I [additionally
argue that the overemphasis on speech acts and under-analysis of the
audience(s) in the framework of Securitization Theory derives from the
tendency of the Copenhagen School scholars to see securitization as a
**universal phenomenon**]{.underline}. According to Balzacq, however,
"the success of securitization is highly contingent upon the
securitizing actor's ability to identify the audience's feelings, needs,
and interests...To persuade the audience, the speaker has to tune
his/her language to the audience's experience."28

[Securitization Theory also **fails to adequately analyze** contextual
issues. Balzacq, for example, claims that whereas Securitization Theory
claims that securitization modifies the external context, the opposite
is also true: the contextual issues and audience characteristics also
influence the process and success of securitization.29]{.underline}
According to Matt McDonald, "in developing a universal framework for the
designation or construction of threat through speech acts, the
Securitization Theory ultimately downplays the importance of contextual
factors."30 Attention to these two related limitations, concerning
audience and context, is essential to the dual securitization framework
too. However, I do not elaborate on these in this article since they
have already been discussed by various scholars, and many empirical
studies have already been conducted with a focus on these issues.31

Dillon and Reid's The Liberal Way of War: Killing to Make Life Live,
www.research.kobe-u.ac.jp/gsics-publication/jics/chandler_18-1.pdf

[This is a book about the 'liberal way of war']{.underline}. But [the
liberal referred to in the title remains under theorized]{.underline}.
On several occasions the authors highlight the distinction between the
liberal way of war and the general framing of war in the modern liberal
era as a geo-strategic contestation, taking the territorial state as its
referent object. For Dillon and Reid, 'liberalism never fitted this
model of modern politics and the modern problematization of war very
well'（p.83). They therefore seek to define liberalism and the liberal
way of war as distinct from war in the liberal era. **[The liberal way
of war refers not to real wars and conflicts but to an abstract model of
conflict]{.underline}**, defined as a desire to'remove war from the life
of humanity'which'derives from the way in which liberalism takes the
life of the species as its referent object of politics ─
biopolitics'（p.84）. [In this framing, the liberal nature of war very
much depends on the self-description of the conflict by its
proponents]{.underline}: these range from Gladstone's occupation of
Egypt in the cause of'suffering humanity', to US liberal ideological
constructions of the cause of'freedom'in the Cold War struggle against
the Soviet Union up to Bush and Blair's war on Iraq in the cause of
humanity（p.6）. As the authors state, of course, [wars may be fought on
other grounds than universal humanity: 'liberal states may...also act as
geopolitical sovereign actors as well...and may also have geopolitical
motives]{.underline} for the wars they wage'（p.84）.¶ **[It is clear
from the beginning that the distinctiveness of 'the liberal way of war'
which they seek to explore cannot be more than a fool's
quest]{.underline}**. They assert that they will critically uncover the
paradox of liberal war: why it is that Realist or geostrategic war
accepts the necessity of war but attempts to limit it, while liberals
wish to end war but, to do so, are willing to fight unlimited wars. Yet,
they admit that **[this starting point is already an ideological dead
end]{.underline}** [─ the wars of the twentieth century give the lie to
the idea that there is some distinction between 'unending crusades' and
'limited jousts between rationally calculative political subjects': war
has its own dynamic]{.underline}（p.7). [Nevertheless, Dillon and Reid
press on and seek to go beyond a Schmittian critique]{.underline} to
ground this paradox in the biopolitical'driver'of the liberal way of
rule ─ biopolitics: wars waged under the banner of the human（against
humans）are liberal and, allegedly biopolitical, as human life is
declared to be the referent in need of being secured. [These wars are
alleged to be fought differently to geo-political wars for territory,
because the 'drivers' of war are not territorialized interests but the
biopolitical framings of the needs of the human, how human life can and
should be lived.]{.underline} [Inevitably there are **insuperable
methodological hurdles** to this Sisyphusian task]{.underline}. Already,
[there occurs the first fundamental aporia: how do we tell the
difference between a liberal and non-liberal war?]{.underline} [There
appears to be no way of preventing the category of liberal war from
becoming a lifeless and descriptive one: wars are liberal and fought
biopolitically only if we are told that these are the motives by those
fighting them]{.underline}.¶ **[This separation of liberal ways of war
from territorialised framings of geostrategic contestation makes little
sense]{.underline}** [as a framework for understanding]{.underline}
either liberal rule or liberal ways of [war]{.underline}. In fact, [in
defining liberal war in this way the connection between liberal rule and
war is entirely severed]{.underline}. ['Liberal war may on occasions
also be geopolitical; which is to say that war may be simultaneously
geopolitical as well as biopolitically driven since the imperatives
behind war are never uniform or simple; but what distinguishes the
liberal way of war as liberal are the biopolitical imperatives which
have consistently driven its violent peace-making.'（p.85）Liberal rule
has also resulted in wars for territory or in defence of
territories]{.underline}; nevertheless, a story, of course, could have
been told about how views of the human fitted those of struggles to
command territory. [This is acknowledged, but sits uneasily with the
narrow view of liberal war for species life.]{.underline} If the racial
doctrines of European empires, up to and including the genocidal racism
of the Nazi regime, were also biopolitically driven ─ and the authors,
indeed, write of race as part of the'liberal biopolitics of the
seventeenth century'─ then [it seems difficult to separate a liberal way
of war from allegedly 'non-liberal' wars of territorial
control]{.underline}.¶ It seems clear that Dillon and Reid do not seek
to take the logical step of arguing that the view of the human reflects,
and is reflected by, how the human is ruled and how wars are both
thought and fought. Why? Because for them there is something
suprahistorically unique and distinct about the liberal way of war: a
distinctly liberal view which foregrounds the human as the referent of
security. Therefore, **[a second aporia arises: on what basis is this
specifically 'liberal'?]{.underline}** [It would appear that every form
of rule and of war has at least an implicit view of the 'human' and
through this view of the human the form of rule and the way of war are
rationalized. There is not and cannot be anything specifically 'liberal'
about this]{.underline}. The humanity in need of securing, through war
on other humans, could be formed by Alexander the Great's stoic
cosmopolitan vision, or could be'God's chosen people', 'the master
race', or 'the gains of the proletarian revolution': there is little
doubt that beliefs of what the human is, or could become, were a vital
part of many non-Liberal dispositifs ─ the discourses and practices - of
both rule and war. ¶ **[The key starting assumption, that the liberal
way of war can be isolated from any other - and]{.underline}** its
alleged specific form, of '**[unending violence', explained by its
referent of the human - appears to be]{.underline}** a **[particularly
unproductive]{.underline}** one. [At the level of abstraction at which
Dillon and Reid choose to work, there is very little here that would
help to distinguish between a liberal and a non-liberal way of
war]{.underline}（the asserted purpose of the book）. Of course, what
matters is what this view of the human is. Here [Dillon and
Reid]{.underline} appear to [recognise the limits of their
essentializing approach]{.underline}: ...just as the liberal way of rule
is constantly adapting and changing so also is the liberal way of war.
There is, in that sense, no one liberal way of rule or one liberal way
of war. But there is a fundamental continuity which justifies us
referring to the singular...the fact that each takes the properties of
species existence as its referent object...finding its expression
historically in many changing formations of rule according...to the
changing exigencies and understanding of species being...（p.84）¶
[Rather than understand our forms of post-political rule and
post-territorial war today on their own terms]{.underline} and then
consider to what extent this way of rule and war can be theorized, and
to what extent, if any, Foucault's conception of biopolitics may be of
assistance, [Dillon and Reid start out from the assumption that we live
in a liberal world of rule and war and that therefore both can be
critiqued]{.underline} through the framework developed by Foucault in
his engagement with understanding the rise and transformation of liberal
forms of rule. [In transposing Foucault's critical engagement with
liberal ways of rule to an understanding of liberal ways of war, Dillon
and Reid take a body of historical work about the changing political
nature of liberal rule and transpose it into an essentialised and under
theorized understanding of liberal war.]{.underline} This is no mean
feat; how they manage this accomplishment will be discussed in the next
two sections.

Constructivism helps to understand and navigate the complex ways in
which states as well as influential non-state actors engage with one
another, how they define themselves and others, and how these shape the
boundaries of the world within which they act.48 It helps explain how
norms based on common ideas and values can help promote security and
cooperation, and how significantly different ideologies can lead to
conflict. Constructivism goes a long way in explaining how individuals
and organizations influence policy decisions. [However, **constructivism
alone can't answer all** policy issues. There are **obvious gaps** that
require the application of **realist** and liberalist perspectives to
comprehend modern international relations]{.underline}.49 [**In today's
complex, ever-changing environment, no theory** is **comprehensive**
enough to stand alone]{.underline}.50 Policy makers and senior advisors
should consider the insights of each theory when articulating national
security policy. Conclusion [**Theory cannot claim primacy over
practice** and implementation, but its understanding is a useful
precursor for both]{.underline}. This is the central argument of this
examination. As senior advisors, how we choose to explain national
security issues inform the solutions we propose. Because national
security policy is important to the practice of military affairs, it is
paramount that senior military leaders develop a good understanding of
those aspects affecting policy formulation. [Improving this
understanding can **provide a stronger foundation** for senior military
leaders to engage more **effectively** with civilian leaders **on
defense-related policies**]{.underline}. [IR theory helps describe **how
policy makers** see the world and how **this influences policy
making**]{.underline}. [**Theory** influences their **perspectives** and
**inform** their **biases** and thus, deserve study and
analysis.]{.underline} Three predominant schools of thought attempt to
explain the way states behave: realism, liberalism, and constructivism.
In general terms, realism focuses on state power, typically in relation
to other states. For the United States, realist policies can translate
into hegemonic actions designed to maintain preeminence in the world.
Liberalism stresses the emphasis on democratic institutions and economic
interdependence. This can prompt policies designed to maximize
international cooperation through international bodies and trade at the
expense of defense-related capabilities. Constructivism highlights the
influence of shared norms, values, and ideas on state behavior.
Normative policies generally focused on establishing international rules
and norms of behavior states are expected to follow with heavy emphasis
in the diplomatic and legal arenas. [**Theory**, however, **is no
panacea**]{.underline}. [While these theories offer useful frameworks
with which to observe international relations, they tend to either
**overemphasize or underestimate attributes** in state behavior such as
the primacy of power, the importance of interdependence or the necessity
of norms]{.underline}. [Thus, policy making and subsequent execution
relying on **one theory** at the exclusion of others **is
risky**]{.underline}. Senior military officers and policy advisors
cannot be content with simply knowing what policy is. They must
understand what policy does and the mechanisms available to recommend
appropriate and effective policy. Having an understanding of how
perceptions of the world and state behavior affect policy decisions is a
way to do so. [In this regard, IR theory remains **essential** for
**understanding** world events, explaining their causes, assessing their
impacts, and proposing suitable solutions.]{.underline} As Snyder
suggests, "to use the insights of each of the three theoretical
traditions as a check on the irrational exuberance of the others."51
There is utility in theory, but it is the practitioners' role to
determine how they apply. Most importantly, it is the practitioner's job
to make the best use of them in order to advance national goals.

Transatlantic Divide: Why Securitization Has Not Secured a Place in
American IR, Why It Should, and How It Can," Duck of Minerva, 9-18-2015,

Securitization theory has rightly garnered much attention among European
scholars of international relations. Its basic claims are powerful: that
security threats are not given, but require active construction; that
the boundaries of "security" are malleable; that the declaration that a
certain problem lies within the realm of security is itself a productive
political act; and that "security" issues hold a trump card, demanding
disproportionate resources and silencing alternative perspectives.
Securitization thus highlights a familiar, even ubiquitous, political
process that had received little attention in the international
relations or comparative foreign policy literatures. It gave scholars a
theoretical language, if not quite a set of coherent theoretical tools,
with which to make sense of how a diverse set of issues, from migration
to narcotics flows to global climate change, sometimes came to be
treated as matters of national and global security and thereby---and
this is where securitization's critical edge came to the fore---impeded
reasoned political debate. No surprise that, as Jarrod and Eric observe,
securitization has been the focus of so many articles in the EJIR---and
even more in such journals as the Review of International Studies and
Security Dialogue. But [there are (good) substantive and]{.underline}
(not so good) [sociological reasons that **securitization has failed to
gain traction in North America**]{.underline}. First, and [most
important, securitization describes a process but leaves us well short
of (a) a fully specified causal theory that (b) takes proper account of
the politics of rhetorical contestation]{.underline}. According to the
foundational theorists of the Copenhagen School, actors, usually elites,
transform the social order from one of normal, everyday politics into a
Schmittian world of crisis by identifying a dire threat to the political
community. [They conceive of this "securitizing move" in linguistic
terms, as a speech act]{.underline}. As Ole Waever (1995: 55) argues,
"By saying it \[security\], something is done (as in betting, a promise,
naming a ship). . . . \[T\]he word 'security' is the act . . ."
\[emphasis added\]. Securitization is a powerful discursive process that
constitutes social reality. Countless articles and books have traced
this process, and its consequences, in particular policy domains.
[Securitization presents itself as a **causal** account. But its
**mechanisms remain obscure**, as do the **conditions** under which it
operates]{.underline}. Why is speaking security so powerful? [How do
mere words twist and transform the social order? Does the invocation of
security prompt a visceral emotional response? Are speech acts
persuasive, by using well-known tropes to convince audiences that they
must seek protection? Or does securitization operate through the
politics of rhetorical coercion, silencing potential opponents? In
securitization accounts, **speech acts** often seem to be **magical
incantations** that upend normal politics through pathways shrouded in
mystery]{.underline}. [Equally unclear is why **some** securitizing
moves resonate, while others \[are **ignored**\]]{.underline} ~~fall on
deaf ears~~. [Certainly not all attempts to construct threats
succeed]{.underline}, and this is true of both traditional military
concerns as well as "new" security issues. [Both neoconservatives and
structural realists in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[have long insisted that **conflict with China is inevitable**, yet
China has over the last **25 years** been more opportunity than threat
in US political discourse---**despite** these **vigorous and persistent
securitizing moves**]{.underline}. [In very recent years, the balance
has shifted, and the China threat has started to catch on: **linguistic
processes alone cannot account for this change**]{.underline}. The US
military has repeatedly declared that global climate change has profound
implications for national security---but that has hardly cast aside
climate change deniers, many of whom are ironically foreign policy hawks
supposedly deferential to the uniformed military. Authoritative speakers
have varied in the efficacy of their securitizing moves. While George W.
Bush powerfully framed the events of 9/11 as a global war against
American values, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a more gifted orator,
struggled to convince a skeptical public that Germany presented an
imminent threat to the United States. [After thirty years as an active
research program, securitization theory has **hardly begun to offer
acceptable answers** to these questions. **Brief references to
"facilitating conditions" won't cut it**. You don't have to subscribe to
a covering-law conception of theory to find these questions important or
to find securitization's answers unsatisfying]{.underline}. A large part
of the problem, we believe, lies in securitization's silence on the
politics of security. Its foundations in speech act theory have yielded
an oddly apolitical theoretical framework. In its seminal formulation,
the Copenhagen school emphasized the internal linguistic rules that must
be followed for a speech act to be recognized as competent. Yet as
Thierry Balzacq argues, [by treating securitization as a purely
rule-driven process]{.underline}, the Copenhagen school [ignores the
politics of securitization]{.underline}, reducing "security to a
conventional procedure such as marriage or betting in which the
'felicity circumstances' (conditions of success) must fully prevail for
the act to go through" (2005:172). [Absent from this picture are fierce
rhetorical battles, where coalitions counter securitizing moves with
their own appeals that strike more or less deeply at underlying
narratives. Absent as well are the public intellectuals and media, who
question and critique securitizing moves]{.underline} sometimes (and not
others), [sometimes to good effect (and sometimes with little
impact)]{.underline}. [The **audience** itself---whether the mass public
or a narrower elite stratum---is **stripped of all
agency**]{.underline}. [Speaking security, even when the performance is
competent, **does not sweep this politics away**]{.underline}. Only by
delving into this politics can we shed light on the mysteries of
securitization. We see rhetorical politics as constituted less by
singular "securitizing moves" than by "contentious conversation"---to
use Charles Tilly's phrase. To this end, we would urge securitization
theorists, as we recently have elsewhere, to move towards a "pragmatic"
model that rests on four analytical wagers: that actors are both
strategic and social; that legitimation works by imparting meaning to
political action; that legitimation is laced through with contestation;
and that the power of language emerges through contentious dialogue. We
are heartened that our ambivalence about securitization---the ways in
which we find it by turns appealing and dissatisfying---and our vision
for how to move forward have in the last decade been echoed by (mostly)
European colleagues. These critics have laid out a research agenda that
would, if taken up, produce more satisfying, and more deeply political,
theoretical accounts. In our own work, both individual and collective,
we have tried to advance that research agenda. So long as securitization
theorists resist defining the theory's scope and mechanisms, and so long
as it remains wedded to apolitical underpinnings, we think it unlikely
to gain a broad following on this side of the pond. [Second,
securitization has been held back by another way in which it is
apolitical]{.underline}---this time thanks to its Schmittian commitments
and political vision. [Successful securitization, in seminal accounts,
replaces normal patterns of politics with the world of the
exception]{.underline}, in which contest has no place. [They imagine
security as the ultimate trump card. But, in reality, the divide is not
nearly so stark. Security **does not crowd out all other spending
priorities**---or states would spend on nothing but defense and
"securitized" issues. **Nor** does simply declaring something a matter
of national security **guarantee its funding**]{.underline}---or global
climate change counter-measures, including research on renewable
energies, would be well-funded. [Nor are security issues somehow aloof
from politics: politics has never truly stopped "at the water's edge."
Securitization considers only the politics of security. Its strangely
dichotomous optic cannot see or make sense of the politics within
security]{.underline}. In ignoring the politics within security,
securitization is of course in good company. Realists of all stripes
have paid little attention to domestic political contest, except as a
distraction from structural imperatives. But while realism is
unquestionably a powerful first-cut, [this inattention to the politics
within security is also among the reasons so many have found it
wanting]{.underline}. As Arnold Wolfers long ago observed, some degree
of insecurity is the normal state of affairs. But "some may find the
danger to which they are exposed entirely normal and in line with their
modest security expectations while others consider it unbearable to live
with these same dangers." And states, he further argues, do not actually
maximize security---almost ever. "Even when there has been no question
that armaments would mean more security, the cost in taxes, the
reduction in social benefits, or the sheer discomfort involved have
militated effectively against further effort" (1962:151, 153). [A
securitization perspective renders all this politics within security
inexplicable. And yet]{.underline}, as Wolfers saw half a century ago,
[it is crucial]{.underline}.

Russia," Security Dialogue, 4-7-2017,

According to Buzan, Wæver and De Wilde's foundational text of the theory
of securitization, Security: A New Framework for Analysis (1998), [an
issue can be]{.underline} non-politicized (it is not subject to public
debate or policymaking), politicized (it is publicly debated and subject
to policymaking) or [securitized]{.underline} ([it is presented as an
existential threat, authorizing measures outside normal politics to
address it]{.underline}), and 'any issue can end up on any part of the
spectrum' (Buzan et al., 1998: 24). The Copenhagen School model outlines
that [for an issue to be repositioned from the status of non-politicized
or politicized to that of securitized requires an authorized and
responsible actor to name it as an existential security threat to a
particular referent object, and for this 'securitizing move' to be
accepted by the relevant audience of this referent object, the endorsing
of extraordinary measures to address it]{.underline}. In turn,
[desecuritizations are processes 'in which a political community
**downgrades** or **ceases to treat something as an existential threat**
to a valued referent object, and reduces or stops calling for
exceptional measures to deal with the threat']{.underline} (Buzan and
Wæver, cited in Coskun, 2008: 405).

As such, [the key aim of securitization theory is to identify what,
when, where and how an issue is moved from being part of the normal
environment of politics to becoming a threat to security and beyond the
scope of normal politics]{.underline} -- and vice versa
(desecuritization). The Copenhagen School securitization model gained
considerable popularity during the 2000s, and was applied to the
empirical study of a diverse range of security issues, including the War
on Terror (Buzan, 2006), immigration, trafficking and minority rights
(Huysmans, 1998, 2000; Aradau, 2004; Sasse, 2005; Jutila, 2006),
societal insecurity, human rights (Morozov, 2002), environmental
politics, HIV/AIDS (Elbe, 2006) and EU security (Huysmans, 2000;
Balzacq, 2008; Neal, 2009). However, it has also been the subject of a
series of critiques and modifications from both its staunch supporters
and ardent critics. As Ciută notes, this critique has three main
strands: conceptual (structural issues particularly related to speech
act theory and other necessary components of the model); epistemological
(how securitization views contexts); and normative (related to the shift
from securitization speech acts to practices of the political and the
liberal) (Ciută, 2009: 302).

In light of these critiques, a 'second-generation' research agenda
emerged among 'contextual securitization scholars' (Stritzel, 2012:
553), which is concerned with combining the formal aspects of the
securitization model with a greater emphasis on examining the
interrelationship between security politics and the contexts in which it
operates. The aim of this agenda is to 'construct a more comprehensive
understanding of underlying processes' by focusing on the
'socio-linguistic and/or socio-political micro-dynamics of generating
threats' (Stritzel, 2012: 553; see also Balzacq, 2005, 2011; Guzzini,
2011; Salter, 2008; Stritzel, 2007, 2011; McDonald, 2008, 2011).
Mirroring the original debate about the Copenhagen School model, the
initial focus of such second-generation scholarship centred on analysing
securitizing moves, while the inverse process of desecuritizing moves
did not receive much attention (Coskun, 2008: 393). Recently, however,
second-generation [scholars have begun to delve more deeply into what it
means to desecuritize an issue and ask what a desecuritized issue would
look like]{.underline} (see Åtland, 2008; Aradau, 2004; Aras and Polat,
2008; Behnke, 2006; Cui and Li, 2011; Hansen, 2012; Knudsen, 2001; Roe,
2004; Wæver, 1995; Oelsner, 2005; Coskun, 2008; Salter, 2008; Klinke and
Perombelon 2015).

[These efforts have revealed a **lack of basic consensus** on the nature
of desecuritization as a concept, model or process]{.underline}. As
Coskun rightly points out, 'the Copenhagen School does not suggest an
explicit framework for its analysis as it has done for securitization';
'[different scholars have **interpreted** and **implied**
desecuritization **differently**]{.underline}' (Coskun, 2008: 395). [The
notion that to analyse desecuritization is simply to follow the
Copenhagen School securitization model, but in reverse, has **proven
problematic**]{.underline}. Åtland (2008: 292) argues that, as opposed
to securitization, '[desecuritization **does not necessarily happen** as
the result of a "speech act". Rather, there are many other ways that an
issue or issue-area can be moved out of the sphere of security politics
and into the sphere of regular politics'. For many scholars,
desecuritizing moves have come to be considered as the product of a
**wider management process**, rather than a **singular speech act or
debate**]{.underline} (for more on this debate, see Roe, 2004, 2006;
Jutila, 2006).

New Dual Framework," Uluslararasi Iliskiler, 7-1-2020,

[In addition, by focusing on the illocutionary act, securitization is
presented as happening within a single moment rather than as a process
over time]{.underline}. Ole Wæver, for example, argues "the utterance
itself is the act ... by uttering security, a state representative moves
a particular development into a specific area, and thereby claims a
special right to use whatever means to block it."37 [That is,
securitization occurs just within the moment when the speech act is
performed, and the audience has accepted it]{.underline}.38 Although
this Schmittian stance has somewhat changed in the 1998 book39 by
focusing on the securitizing move and the inherent processual nature of
persuasion of the audience, the processual understanding of
securitization is still limited. Still, in this framework of the
Copenhagen School (successful) securitization ends with the persuasion
of a sufficient number of right people and the start of the
extraordinary measures.40 However[, I argue that securitization should
be considered as a process that includes the definition of security,
discursive efforts to convince the audience, security practices that
normalize and routinize the security definition, the clashes between
rival security definitions and arguments, and the insecurities that
result from these security practices.]{.underline} I further argue that
securitization lasts until the issue is fully desecuritized[. It can
further be argued that securitization and desecuritization may occur
simultaneously; some groups may be struggling to securitize an issue,
while others may be working for its desecuritization.]{.underline}

[The main shortcoming of Securitization Theory relevant for the argument
of this study is the lack of the analysis of rival voices]{.underline}.
[Securitization is considered as truth construction]{.underline}. That
is, the Securitizing actor proposes a truth claim and convinces
audiences of this claim. The securitizing actor proposes a security
definition in which s/he describes the threat, legitimate security
provider, referent object, and legitimate means to deal with the issue[.
However, there are always rivals who reject this truth claim or, in most
cases, counter truth claims, and definitions emerge.]{.underline} This a
constant conflict between these truth claims, while constructing
security issues means that a securitization analysis should also examine
these rival voices. [These rival voices may take the form of non-violent
opposition or counter-securitization. To overcome this limitation, a
dual approach is required to examine rival voices in the securitization
process.]{.underline}

[The lack of a dual approach in Securitization Theory means that a
securitization analysis can only problematize one side, namely that of
the securitizing actors, by revealing how they create security issues
and use security discourses to achieve their own aims. In most cases,
this actor is the state or other formal institutions like the
EU.]{.underline} In most cases, however, particularly when
counter-securitization emerges, other securitizing actors are involved
that should also be problematized. These may also use extraordinary or
violent means like the use of force. For example, in the securitization
of a minority group in a country, the state may be the securitizing
actor, which uses extraordinary means as a result of a securitization
process. [However, there may also be a counter-securitization against
the state from within this minority group, and this securitizing actor
may also be using extraordinary means against the state like the use of
force. The sequence of the primary and counter-securitization may also
change. Hence, both primary and counter-securitizations should be
investigated in a comprehensive securitization analysis. However, it
should be stated that there does not have to be a countersecuritization
in all securitization cases. There may also be non-violent opposition
depending on the contextual factors, but I argue that there are always
rival voices in line with the argument of Foucault that "where there is
power there is resistance."41]{.underline}

de Janeir

Marcelo de Araujo, "Moral Enhancement and Political Realism," Journal of
Evolution and Technology, 6-xx-2014, https://jetpress.org/v24/araujo.htm

Some [moral enhancement theorists argue]{.underline} that [a society of
**morally enhanced individuals**]{.underline} [would be in a better
position to cope with important problems that humankind is likely to
face in]{.underline} the future such as, for instance, the threats posed
by **[climate change]{.underline}**, grand scale **[terrorist
attacks]{.underline}**, or the risk of **[catastrophic
wars.]{.underline}** [The assumption here is]{.underline} quite simple:
[our inability to cope successfully with these problems stems mainly
from a sort of deficit in human beings' **moral
motivation**]{.underline}. [If human beings were morally
better]{.underline} -- if we had enhanced moral dispositions -- [there
would be **fewer wars, less terrorism**, and more **willingness to save
our environment**.]{.underline} Although simple and attractive, **[this
assumption is]{.underline}**, as I intend to show,
**[false]{.underline}**. [At the root of threats to the survival of
humankind in the future is not a deficit in our moral
dispositions]{.underline}, [but the endurance of an **old political
arrangement** that prevents the pursuit of shared goals on a collective
basis.]{.underline} The political arrangement I have in mind here is the
international system of states. In my analysis of the political
implications of moral enhancement, I intend to concentrate my attention
only on the supposition that we could avoid major wars in the future by
making individuals morally better. I do not intend to discuss the
threats posed by climate change, or by terrorism, although some human
enhancement theorists also seek to cover these topics. I will explain,
in the course of my analysis, a conceptual distinction between "human
nature realism" and "structural realism," well-known in the field of
international relations theory. Thomas Douglas seems to have been among
the first to explore the idea of "moral enhancement" as a new form of
human enhancement. He certainly helped to kick off the current phase of
the debate. In a paper published in 2008, Douglas suggests that in the
"future people might use biomedical technology to morally enhance
themselves." Douglas characterizes moral enhancement in terms of the
acquisition of "morally better motives" (Douglas 2008, 229). Mark
Walker, in a paper published in 2009, suggests a similar idea. He
characterizes moral enhancement in terms of improved moral dispositions
or "genetic virtues": The Genetic Virtue Program (GVP) is a proposal for
influencing our moral nature through biology, that is, it is an
alternate yet complementary means by which ethics and ethicists might
contribute to the task of making our lives and world a better place. The
basic idea is simple enough: genes influence human behavior, so altering
the genes of individuals may alter the influence genes exert on
behavior. (Walker 2009, 27--28) Walker does not argue in favor of any
specific moral theory, such as, for instance, virtue ethics. Whether one
endorses a deontological or a utilitarian approach to ethics, he argues,
the concept of virtue is relevant to the extent that virtues motivate us
either to do the right thing or to maximize the good (Walker 2009, 35).
Moral enhancement theory, however, does not reduce the ethical debate to
the problem of moral dispositions. Morality also concerns, to a large
extent, questions about reasons for action. And moral enhancement, most
certainly, will not improve our moral beliefs; neither could it be used
to settle moral disagreements. This seems to have led some authors to
criticize the moral enhancement idea on the ground that it neglects the
cognitive side of our moral behavior. Robert Sparrow, for instance,
argues that, from a Kantian point of view, moral enhancement would have
to provide us with better moral beliefs rather than enhanced moral
motivation (Sparrow 2014, 25; see also Agar 2010, 74). Yet, it seems to
me that this objection misses the point of the moral enhancement idea.
[Many people, across different countries, already share moral beliefs
relating]{.underline}, for instance, [to the wrongness of harming or
killing other people arbitrarily,]{.underline} or to the moral
requirement to help people in need. They may share moral beliefs while
not sharing the same reasons for these beliefs, or perhaps even not
being able to articulate the beliefs in the conceptual framework of a
moral theory (Blackford 2010, 83). But although they share some moral
beliefs, in some circumstances they may lack the appropriate motivation
to act accordingly. Moral enhancement, thus, aims at improving moral
motivation, and leaves open the question as to how to improve our moral
judgments. In a recent paper, published in The Journal of Medical
Ethics, neuroscientist Molly Crockett reports the state of the art in
the still very embryonic field of moral enhancement. She points out, for
example, that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
citalopram seems to increase harm aversion. There is, moreover, some
evidence that this substance may be effective in the treatment of
specific types of aggressive behavior. Like Douglas, Crockett emphasizes
that moral enhancement should aim at individuals' moral motives
(Crockett 2014; see also Spence 2008; Terbeck et al. 2013). Another
substance that is frequently mentioned in the moral enhancement
literature is oxytocin. Some [studies suggest that willingness to
cooperate with other people]{.underline},and to trust unknown
prospective cooperators, [may be enhanced by an increase in the levels
of oxytoci]{.underline}n in the organism (Zak 2008, 2011; Zak and Kugler
2011; Persson and Savulescu 2012, 118--119). Oxytocin has also been
reported to be "associated with the subjective experience of empathy"
(Zak 2011, 55; Zak and Kugler 2011, 144). The question I would like to
examine now concerns the supposition that moral enhancement --
comprehended in these terms and assuming for the sake of argument that,
some day, it might become effective and safe -- may also help us in
coping with the threat of devastating wars in the future. [The
assumption that there is a relationship between,]{.underline} on the one
hand, [threats to the survival of humankind and]{.underline}, on the
other, [a sort of "deficit" in our moral dispositions is
c]{.underline}learly [made by]{.underline} some [moral enhancements
theorists]{.underline}. Douglas, for instance, argues that "according to
many plausible theories, some of the world's most important problems ---
such as developing world poverty, climate change and war --- can be
attributed to these moral deficits" (2008, 230). Walker, in a similar
vein, writes about the possibility of "using biotechnology to alter our
biological natures in an effort to reduce evil in the world" (2009, 29).
And Julian Savulescu and Ingmar Persson go as far as to defend the "the
need for moral enhancement" of humankind in a series of articles, and in
a book published in 2012. One of the reasons Savulescu and Persson
advance for the moral enhancement of humankind is that our moral
dispositions seem to have remained basically unchanged over the last
millennia (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 2). These dispositions have
proved thus far quite useful for the survival of human beings as a
species. They have enabled us to cooperate with each other in the
collective production of things such as food, shelter, tools, and
farming. They have also played a crucial role in the creation and
refinement of a variety of human institutions such as settlements,
villages, and laws. Although the possibility of free-riding has never
been fully eradicated, the benefits provided by cooperation have largely
exceeded the disadvantages of our having to deal with occasional
uncooperative or untrustworthy individuals (Persson and Savulescu 2012,
39). The problem, however, is that the same dispositions that have
enabled human beings in the past to engage in the collective production
of so many artifacts and institutions now seem powerless in the face of
the human capacity to destroy other human beings on a grand scale, or
perhaps even to annihilate the entire human species. There is, according
to Savulescu and Persson, a "mismatch" between our cognitive faculties
and our evolved moral attitudes: "\[...\] as we have repeatedly
stressed, owing to the progress of science, the range of our powers of
action has widely outgrown the range of our spontaneous moral attitudes,
and created a dangerous mismatch" (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 103; see
also Persson and Savulescu 2010, 660; Persson and Savulescu 2011b;
DeGrazie 2012, 2; Rakić 2014, 2). This worry about the mismatch between,
on the one hand, the modern technological capacity to destroy and, on
the other, our limited moral commitments is not new. The political
philosopher Hans Morgenthau, best known for his defense of political
realism, called attention to the same problem nearly fifty years ago. In
the wake of the first successful tests with thermonuclear bombs,
conducted by the USA and the former Soviet Union, Morgenthau referred to
the "contrast" between the technological progress of our age and our
feeble moral attitudes as one of the most disturbing dilemmas of our
time: The first dilemma consists in the contrast between the
technological unification of the world and the parochial moral
commitments and political institutions of the age. Moral commitments and
political institutions, dating from an age which modern technology has
left behind, have not kept pace with technological achievements and,
hence, are incapable of controlling their destructive potentialities.
(Morgenthau 1962, 174) Moral enhancement theorists and political
realists like Morgenthau, therefore, share the thesis that our natural
moral dispositions are not strong enough to prevent human beings from
endangering their own existence as a species. But they differ as to the
best way out of this quandary: moral enhancement theorists argue for the
re-engineering of our moral dispositions, whereas Morgenthau accepted
the immutability of human nature and argued, instead, for the
re-engineering of world politics. Both positions, as I intend to show,
are wrong in assuming that the "dilemma" results from the weakness of
our spontaneous moral dispositions in the face of the unprecedented
technological achievements of our time. On the other hand, [both
positions are correct in recognizing the **real possibility** of global
catastrophes resulting from the malevolent use of, for instance,
**biotechnology or nuclear capabilities.**]{.underline} The supposition
that individuals' unwillingness to cooperate with each other, even when
they would be better-off by choosing to cooperate, results from a sort
of deficit of dispositions such as altruism, empathy, and benevolence
has been at the core of some important political theories. This idea is
an important assumption in the works of early modern political realists
such as Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes. It was also later endorsed by
some well-known authors writing about the origins of war in the first
half of the twentieth century. It was then believed, as Sigmund Freud
suggested in a text from 1932, that the main cause of wars is a human
tendency to "hatred and destruction" (in German: ein Trieb zum Hassen
und Vernichtung). [Freud went as far as to suggest that human beings
have an ingrained "inclination" to "aggression" and
"destruction"]{.underline} (Aggressionstrieb, Aggressionsneigung, and
Destruktionstrieb), and that this inclination has a "good biological
basis" (biologisch wohl begründet) (Freud 1999, 20--24; see also Freud
1950; Forbes 1984; Pick 1993, 211--227; Medoff 2009). The [attempt to
employ Freud's conception of human nature in understanding international
relations has recently been resumed]{.underline}, for instance by Kurt
Jacobsen in a paper entitled "Why Freud Matters: Psychoanalysis and
International Relations Revisited," published in 2013. Morgenthau
himself was deeply influenced by Freud's speculations on the origins of
war.1 Early in the 1930s, Morgenthau wrote an essay called "On the
Origin of the Political from the Nature of Human Beings" (Über die
Herkunft des Politischen aus dem Wesen des Menschen), which contains
several references to Freud's theory about the human propensity to
aggression.2 Morgenthau's most influential book, Politics among Nations:
The Struggle for Power and Peace, first published in 1948 and then
successively revised and edited, is still considered a landmark work in
the tradition of political realism. According to Morgenthau, politics is
governed by laws that have their origin in human nature: "Political
realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by
objective laws that have their roots in human nature" (Morgenthau 2006,
4). Just like human enhancement theorists, Morgenthau also takes for
granted that human nature has not changed over recent millennia: "Human
nature, in which the laws of politics have their roots, has not changed
since the classical philosophies of China, India, and Greece endeavored
to discover these laws" (Morgenthau 2006, 4). And since, for Morgenthau,
human nature prompts human beings to act selfishly, rather than
cooperatively, political leaders will sometimes favor conflict over
cooperation, unless some superior power compels them to act otherwise.
Now, this is exactly what happens in the domain of international
relations. For in the international sphere there is not a supranational
institution with the real power to prevent states from pursuing means of
self-defense. The acquisition of means of self-defense, however, is
frequently perceived by other states as a threat to their own security.
This leads to the security dilemma and the possibility of war. As
Morgenthau put the problem in an article published in 1967: "The actions
of states are determined not by moral principles and legal commitments
but by considerations of interest and power" (1967, 3). Because
Morgenthau and early modern political philosophers such as Machiavelli
and Hobbes defended political realism on the grounds provided by a
specific conception human nature, their version of political realism has
been frequently called "human nature realism." The literature on human
nature realism has become quite extensive (Speer 1968; Booth 1991;
Freyberg-Inan 2003; Kaufman 2006; Molloy 2006, 82--85; Craig 2007;
Scheuerman 2007, 2010, 2012; Schuett 2007; Neascu 2009; Behr 2010,
210--225; Brown 2011; Jütersonke 2012). It is not my intention here to
present a fully-fledged account of the tradition of human nature
realism, but rather to emphasize the extent to which some moral
enhancement theorists, in their description of some of the gloomy
scenarios humankind is likely to face in the future, implicitly endorse
this kind of political realism. Indeed, like human nature realists,
moral enhancement theorists assume that human nature has not changed
over the last millennia, and that violence and lack of cooperation in
the international sphere result chiefly from human nature's limited
inclination to pursue morally desirable goals. One may, of course,
criticize the human enhancement project by rejecting the assumption that
conflict and violence in the international domain should be explained by
means of a theory about human nature. In a reply to Savulescu and
Persson, [Sparrow correctly argues that **"structural issues,"** rather
than **human nature**, constitute the main factor underlying political
conflicts]{.underline} (Sparrow 2014, 29). But he does not explain what
exactly these "structural issues" are, as I intend to do later. Sparrow
is right in rejecting the human nature theory underlying the human
enhancement project. But this underlying assumption, in my view, is not
trivially false or simply "ludicrous," as he suggests. Human nature
realism has been implicitly or explicitly endorsed by leading political
philosophers ever since Thucydides speculated on the origins of war in
antiquity (Freyberg-Inan 2003, 23--36). True, it might be objected that
"human nature realism," as it was defended by Morgenthau and earlier
political philosophers, relied upon a metaphysical or psychoanalytical
conception of human nature, a conception that, actually, did not have
the support of any serious scientific investigation (Smith 1983, 167).
Yet, over the last few years there has been much empirical research in
fields such as developmental psychology and evolutionary biology that
apparently gives some support to the realist claim. Some of these
studies suggest that an inclination to aggression and conflict has its
origins in our evolutionary history. This idea, then, has recently led
some authors to resume "human nature realism" on new foundations, devoid
of the metaphysical assumptions of the early realists, and entirely
grounded in empirical research. Indeed, some recent works in the field
of international relations theory already seek to call attention to
evolutionary biology as a possible new start for political realism. This
point is clearly made, for instance, by Bradley Thayer, who published in
2004 a book called Darwin and International Relations: On the
Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict. And in a paper
published in 2000, he affirms the following: Evolutionary theory
provides a stronger foundation for realism because it is based on
science, not on theology or metaphysics. I use the theory to explain two
human traits: egoism and domination. I submit that the egoistic and
dominating behavior of individuals, which is commonly described as
"realist," is a product of the evolutionary process. I focus on these
two traits because they are critical components of any realist argument
in explaining international politics. (Thayer 2000, 125; see also Thayer
2004) Thayer basically argues that a tendency to egoism and domination
stems from human evolutionary history. The predominance of conflict and
competition in the domain of international politics, he argues, is a
reflex of dispositions that can now be proved to be part of our evolved
human nature in a way that Morgenthau and other earlier political
philosophers could not have established in their own time. Now, what
some moral enhancement theorists propose is a direct intervention in our
"evolved limited moral psychology" as a means to make us "fit" to cope
with some possible devastating consequences from the predominance of
conflict and competition in the domain of international politics
(Persson and Savulescu 2010, 664). Moral enhancement theorists
comprehend the nature of war and conflicts, especially those conflicts
that humankind is likely to face in the future, as the result of human
beings' limited moral motivations. Compared to supporters of human
nature realism, however, moral enhancement theorists are less skeptical
about the prospect of our taming human beings' proclivity to do evil.
For our knowledge in fields such as neurology and pharmacology does
already enable us to enhance people's performance in a variety of
activities, and there seems to be no reason to assume it will not enable
us to enhance people morally in the future. But [the
question]{.underline}, of course, is [whether moral enhancement
will]{.underline} also [improve the prospect of our coping
successfully]{.underline} [with]{.underline} some major threats to the
**[survival of humankind]{.underline}**, as Savulescu and Persson
propose, or **[to reduce evil in the world]{.underline}**, as proposed
by Walker. V. The point to which I would next like to call attention is
that "human nature realism" -- which is implicitly presupposed by some
moral enhancement theorists -- has been much criticized over the last
decades within the tradition of political realism itself. "Structural
realism," unlike "human nature realism," does not seek to derive a
theory about conflicts and violence in the context of international
relations from a theory of the moral shortcomings of human nature.
Structural realism was originally proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the
State and War, published in 1959, and then later in another book called
Theory of International Politics, published in 1979. In both works,
Waltz seeks to avoid committing himself to any specific conception of
human nature (Waltz 2001, x--xi). Waltz's thesis is that the thrust of
the political realism doctrine can be retained without our having to
commit ourselves to any theory about the shortcomings of human nature.
What is relevant for our understanding of international politics is,
instead, our understanding of the "structure" of the international
system of states (Waltz 1986). John Mearsheimer, too, is an important
contemporary advocate of political realism. Although he seeks to
distance himself from some ideas defended by Waltz, he also rejects
human nature realism and, like Waltz, refers to himself as a supporter
of "structural realism" (Mearsheimer 2001, 20). One of the basic tenets
of political realism (whether "human nature realism" or "structural
realism") is, first, that the [states are the]{.underline} main, if not
the **[only, relevant actors]{.underline}** in the context of
international relations; [and]{.underline} second, that states
**[compete for power]{.underline}** in the international arena. **[Moral
considerations]{.underline}** in international affairs, according to
realists, [are **secondary**]{.underline} [when set against the state's
primary goal]{.underline}, **[namely its own security and
survival]{.underline}**. But while human nature realists such as
Morgenthau explain the struggle for power as a result of human beings'
natural inclinations, structural realists like Waltz and Mearsheimer
argue that conflicts in the international arena do not stem from human
nature, but from the very "structure" of the international system of
states (Mearsheimer 2001, 18). According to Waltz and Mearsheimer, [it
is this **structure** that compels individuals to act as they do in the
domain of international affairs.]{.underline} And one distinguishing
feature of the international system of states is [its "anarchical
structure,"]{.underline} i.e. the lack of a central government analogous
to the central governments that exist in the context of domestic
politics. [It means that each individual state is responsible for its
own integrity and survival]{.underline}. [In the absence of a superior
authority]{.underline}, over and above the power of each sovereign
state, [political leaders]{.underline} often [feel compelled to favor
**security over morality**]{.underline}, even if, all other things being
considered, they would naturally be more inclined to trust and to
cooperate with political leaders of other states. On the other hand,
when political leaders do trust and cooperate with other states, it is
not necessarily their benevolent nature that motivates them to be
cooperative and trustworthy, but, again, it is the structure of the
system of states that compels them. The concept of human nature, as we
can see, does not play a decisive role here. Because Waltz and
Mearsheimer depart from "human nature realism," their version of
political realism has also sometimes been called "neo-realism" (Booth
1991, 533). Thus, **[even if]{.underline}** [human beings turn out to
become **morally enhanced**]{.underline} in the future, [humankind may
still have to face the same **scary scenarios**]{.underline} described
by some moral enhancement theorists. [This is likely to happen if,
indeed]{.underline}, [human beings remain compelled to
cooperate]{.underline} within the present structure of the system of
states. Consider, for instance, the incident with a Norwegian weather
rocket in January 1995. Russian radars detected a missile that was
initially suspected of being on its way to reach Moscow in five minutes.
All levels of Russian military defense were immediately put on alert for
a possible imminent attack and massive retaliation. It is reported that
for the first time in history a Russian president had before him, ready
to be used, the "nuclear briefcase" from which the permission to launch
nuclear weapons is issued. And that happened when the Cold War was
already supposed to be over! In the event, it was realized that the
rocket was leaving Russian territory and Boris Yeltsin did not have to
enter the history books as the man who started the third world war by
mistake (Cirincione 2008, 382).3 But [under the crushing pressure of
having to decide in such a short time, and on the basis of unreliable
information, whether or not to retaliate, even a morally enhanced
Yeltsin might have given orders to launch a devastating nuclear
response]{.underline} -- and that **[in spite of strong moral
dispositions to the contrary.]{.underline}** Writing for The Guardian on
the basis of recently declassified documents, Rupert Myers reports
further incidents similar to the one of 1995. He suggests that as more
states strive to acquire nuclear capability, the danger of a major
nuclear accident is likely to increase (Myers 2014). [What has to be
changed]{.underline}, therefore, [is not human moral
dispositions]{.underline}, **[but the very structure of the political
international system of states]{.underline}** within which we currently
live. As far as major threats to the survival of humankind are
concerned, moral enhancement might play an important role in the future
only to the extent that it will help humankind to change the structure
of the system of states. While [moral enhancement]{.underline} may
possibly have desirable results in some areas of human cooperation that
do not badly threaten our security -- such as donating food, medicine,
and money to poorer countries -- it [will not motivate political leaders
to **dismantle their nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. [Neither will it
deter other political leaders from pursuing nuclear
capability]{.underline}, [at any rate not as long as the structure of
international politics compels them to see prospective cooperators **in
the present as possible enemies in the future.**]{.underline} The idea
of a "structure" should not be understood here in metaphysical terms, as
though it mysteriously existed in a transcendent world and had the
magical power of determining leaders' decisions in this world. The word
"structure" denotes merely a political arrangement in which there are no
powerful law-enforcing institutions. And [in the absence of the kind of
security that law-enforcing institutions have the force to
create]{.underline}, [political leaders will]{.underline} often **[fail
to cooperate,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} occasionally [engage
in]{.underline} conflicts and [wars]{.underline}, [in those areas that
are critical to their]{.underline} security and [survival]{.underline}.
Given the structure of international politics and the basic goal of
survival, [this is likely to continue to happen]{.underline}, **[even
if,]{.underline}** in the future, political [leaders become **less
egoistic and power-seeking**]{.underline} through moral enhancement. On
the other hand, since the structure of the international system of
states is itself another human institution, there is no reason to
suppose that it cannot ever be changed. If people become morally
enhanced in the future they may possibly feel more strongly motivated to
change the structure of the system of states, or perhaps even feel
inclined to abolish it altogether. In my view, however, [addressing
major threats to the survival of humankind in the future by means of
**bioengineering**]{.underline} [is unlikely to yield the **expected
results**, so long as moral enhancement is pursued **within the present
framework of the international system of states.**]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Securitization Inevitable

**Tatum 18** -- Assistant Professor in the Department of Political
Science at Francis Marion University

Dillon Tatum, "Toward a Radical IR," Duck of Minerva, 11-28-2018,
http://duckofminerva.com/2018/11/toward-a-radical-ir.html

David Brook's latest column in the New York Times, banging on the same
themes about "the kids are just not right," raises some questions about
[what it means to engage in radical politics in the Trump
era]{.underline}. Brooks compares [the]{.underline} younger generation's
[belief "that the system itself is rotten and needs to be **torn
down**"]{.underline} to accomodationist and gradualisms. He continues on
to speculate about how these new attitudes might affect older, more
"pragmatic," liberals who desire to work within the system. Brooks, as
usual, uses a conservative argument to position himself in the "middle."
[I have been thinking]{.underline} a lot [about this issue of
**"radicalism"** contra arguments about **working within systems** that
are unjust in thinking about liberal world order and its
futures]{.underline}. It has led me to a question [I am]{.underline}
currently [exploring]{.underline} in a work-in-progress about what [the
possibilities]{.underline} are [of radicalism as a way of approaching
international politics]{.underline}. Against arguments like Brooks', and
even more sophisticated arguments about agonistic democracy developed by
thinkers like Chantal Mouffe, I think [there is a **place in IR** for
radical conceptions of transformation, order, and politics]{.underline}.
[What is radicalism?]{.underline} Brooks never fully fleshes out this
concept. [Philosophy and political theory have engaged with the issue of
radicalism as a concept, though the results are often
divergent]{.underline}. To quote Agnes Heller, in her treatise on
[radical philosophy]{.underline}, it "[can give the world a norm, and it
can will people to want to give a world to the norm]{.underline}."
[Radicalism as an idea, and as a form of critique, mobilizes many
different modes of thinking about the social and the
political]{.underline}. The most comprehensive definition of radicalism
is that provided by Paul [McLaughlin]{.underline}, who [defines
radicalism]{.underline} "[in terms of]{.underline} (i) [a fundamental
orientation]{.underline} (toward fundamental objects) (ii) [in the
political domain]{.underline} (iii) [of an argumentative
nature]{.underline}." More than that, though, we can add that
[radicalism intervenes in the political domain with the goal of
fundamental transformation]{.underline}. Additionally, [though
radicalism]{.underline} indeed [proceeds in an **argumentative nature**,
this methodology for argument is one that is aimed at critiquing, and
seeking the destruction/replacement of existing
institutions]{.underline}. [A revised]{.underline} working [definition
of radicalism]{.underline}, therefore, [is: a way of thinking about
politics that focuses on totalities, **praxis** and **political
action**, and the deployment of historicist methods with an eye toward
"getting to the root of things."]{.underline} Thus, [radicalism is both
a broad range of critical thought and practice, but also is specific in
the realms of focus, **action**, and method]{.underline}. If Brooks is
right that there is a major clash between a radical younger generation
and a more pragmatic and moderate older generation in American politics,
these differences are not well expressed in contemporary thinking about
IR. [Some of the biggest divisions are between]{.underline} what Robert
Cox called **["problem-solving theories"]{.underline}** [and theories
that **critique** such approaches, but provide little argumentation
aimed at tearing structures of injustice down altogether]{.underline}.
[In short: IR, **even at its critical ends**, **is not
radical**]{.underline} (for an excellent exception see here and here).
[Why is this important?]{.underline} This morning, I taught a seminar on
the question "Is Liberal World Order Finished?" [I asked my students to
think about what makes a liberal order "liberal," and then asked: "Can
we fix the liberal world order, or can we imagine a world without
it**?**]{.underline}---[and **what would that look like?**]{.underline}"
[The students were quick to point out the violences, inequities, and
problems inherent in a liberal world order, **but**]{.underline} [it
took a good bit of pushing and prodding to get them to articulate
**whether**/**how** we **should**/**could** take this order apart and
rethink it]{.underline}. [This was not just a difficult task for the
students---it is something IR has not spent enough time meditating
on]{.underline}. [There is a lot to be critical of these
days]{.underline}. And, I disagree with Brooks's pessimism about a
younger radical generation. [Politics is deeply intertwined with
engagements with radicalism]{.underline}. [What]{.underline} I think [is
**missing**]{.underline} [when we consider global politics]{.underline},
though, [is that many of our pressing questions about institutions,
order, and state action proceed from the same sort of moderation,
accomodationism, or---at the most---an immanently critical
vein]{.underline}. If [we want to intellectually and politically
approach issues]{.underline} like: **[What do we make of the future(s)
of liberal world order?]{.underline}** IR needs to engage with
radicalism.

## Link Defense/Turns

**[2AC\-\--Russia Securitization Good]{.underline}**

**Russia is a geostrategic threat and labelling them as such is
essential to maintain NATO cohesion and credibility\-\--failure leads to
deterrence collapse and Russian expansion**

**McInnis and Fata 22** -- Senior fellow in the International Security
Program and the director of the Smart Women, Smart Power Initiative at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Former U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of defense and a nonresident senior advisor at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies

Kathleen J. McInnis and Daniel Fata, \"Russia Still Threatens NATO
Despite Military Failings,\" Foreign
Policy, 5-20-2022, https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/20/russia-threat-nato-madrid-summit/?tpcc=recirc_latestanalysis062921

Recent events in Ukraine have once again proved that reports of NATO's
death are an exaggeration. Many leaders across the alliance have been
quick to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with aid to Kyiv,
increases in their own country's defense budgets, or both. But [as the
war grinds on and the **geopolitical reality** of an **adversarial
relationship** with Russia sets in, NATO must once again take the
**longer view** on]{.underline} what all this means for [trans-Atlantic
and global security.]{.underline}

Conveniently, in less than two months, NATO leaders will meet in Madrid
to endorse the alliance's new strategy. The key question, therefore, is
whether member states will use the moment to reforge NATO's raison
d'être to meet current and future challenges---in particular, by naming
Russia as a threat to the alliance itself. Given the implications of
Ukraine for European and global order, **[the stakes could hardly be
higher.]{.underline}**

[Some take the view that Madrid should mark a reprioritization of U.S.
efforts away from Europe]{.underline} and back toward Asia. Their logic
goes that not only is European defense spending increasing, but Russia
has also demonstrated ineptitude in the prosecution of its war in
Ukraine. That means the longer-term need for significant U.S. forces in
Europe has also therefore declined. And, after all, China is the pacing
threat for Department of Defense planning.

[In fact, **the opposite is true**.]{.underline} For starters, Russian
President Vladimir [Putin has made it **abundantly clear** that **he
views NATO** as a **strategic threat**. Recent events suggest we should
**take these statements** **at face value**. In the runup to the current
war, some analysts developed **elaborate rationales** for why the
buildup of Russian forces]{.underline} on the Ukrainian border [didn't
mean]{.underline} an [invasion]{.underline} was coming, such as a
strengthened negotiating position vis-à-vis Ukraine's future political
directions. [Another Russian invasion of Ukraine was **so**
**obviously** strategically counterproductive that there must have been
another reason for the buildup. **In the event, there
wasn't.**]{.underline}

And [while Russian military incompetence has been startling, planners
**shouldn't leap to conclusions**. Russian forces]{.underline} were not
able to capture Kyiv, but they [have been able to seize tens of
thousands of square miles of territory]{.underline} along Ukraine's
eastern border---at least for now. [Estonia]{.underline}, a Baltic NATO
member that borders Russia, [is less than 20,000 square
miles]{.underline} in size. [Militaries can also reform]{.underline},
especially after disaster, as Ukraine's own army did after its failures
in 2014.

[The United States has **good reasons** to want to **keep NATO
vibrant**: The **strategic benefits** of U.S. leadership are
**manifold**. Not only does American leadership]{.underline} in NATO
[provide pathways for **organizing military coalitions**, but it also
affords the United States privileged status on **trade partnerships**
and **access to bases**. If Putin **achieves his aim** of **discrediting
NATO**, this could lead to trans-Atlantic **strategic insolvency**: a
situation whereby allies]{.underline}, including the United States, [are
**unable** to meet their **security obligations**]{.underline} and,
relatedly, maintain favorable standards of living for their populations.

Which brings us back to Madrid. [The last time that NATO agreed on a
strategic concept was in 2010]{.underline}. It is a document that
specified that, among other things, defense of allied territory remains
a critical mission for the alliance, but it is silent on naming
nation-state threats to NATO. For a variety of domestic and
international political reasons, building formal consensus on threats
among 30 allied states is extremely challenging. Indeed, [in the 2010
document Russia is **viewed as an aspirational partner** for
NATO]{.underline} when it comes to European security---[despite the
**warning sign** of Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia. In the
intervening years, Russia has conducted **destabilizing disinformation
campaigns**]{.underline} in NATO states [and]{.underline} has
[**attacked Ukraine twice**.]{.underline} And while NATO leaders have
condemned Russian aggression, the rhetoric falls short of formally
declaring Russia as a long-term strategic threat to the alliance.

[**Durable consensus requires clarity**. To **prepare NATO** to contend
with this threat over the long term requires a **frank admission** of
the **strategic realities that Russia poses**]{.underline} in the
alliance's new strategic concept, to be adopted in Madrid. As a
practical matter, this will commit NATO members to take budgeting, force
planning, acquisition, and possible troop repositioning seriously---and
put teeth into the declaration. This is needed for NATO planners to
determine, for example, whether spending 2 percent of GDP on defense is
sufficient to meet the challenges to the alliance.

But the real value of the document is what the collective members
reaffirm as to what NATO continues to stand for, what it calls out as
the threats to the member territory, and what it intends to do to
address, deter, and, if necessary, defend against these threats. [By

territory [would **compromise NATO's credibility** and would **give
Putin a pass** for the atrocities and violations]{.underline} he has

Nuclear War Before and It Can Again,\" Toward Freedom, 10-31-2017,
https://towardfreedom.org/archives/activism/mass-mobilization-stopped-nuclear-war-before-and-it-can-again

[A common thread running through the entire post-1945 period is that
people **don't want to think about nuclear war**. When they're
**forced**]{.underline} [to think of it]{.underline}, when they can't
escape it, [they]{.underline} [**want to stop it**. But when it's not in
the **headlines**]{.underline} any more and governments are growing more
reasonable, [they'd]{.underline} **[just as well not]{.underline}**
think about it. If nuclear war did break out today, you can bet more
people would focus on it, but, of course, we don't want that war to have
to take place. [The peace movement's challenge is to maintain
its]{.underline} **[momentum and sense of danger]{.underline}** [---
even though the world might]{.underline} **[seem]{.underline}** [safer
and there are fewer nuclear weapons in the world. If the nations of the
world are **maintaining their arsenals**, the struggle]{.underline}
**[hasn't come to an end.]{.underline}** Do you think [the moment we're
experiencing today with]{.underline} **[Trump]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[North Korea]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[potentially]{.underline}** [a driving force for]{.underline}
**[another peak]{.underline}** [of movement **energy**?]{.underline}
What's different today? It's possible that there will be some revival of
the nuclear disarmament movement, [but we]{.underline} **[haven't
seen]{.underline}** [the surge of resistance **yet**.]{.underline} I'm a
co-chair of the national board of the group Peace Action, so I'm very
well aware of how peace groups are doing. While Peace Action isn't doing
badly, we're certainly not yet experiencing the surge of action in the
streets, such as when its predecessors, SANE and the Nuclear Freeze
Campaign, were taking off. One reason it's not taking place is that the
mass media rarely focus on the danger of nuclear war, and when they do
focus on it, it's the danger of some other country waging war on the
United States. One day it's Iran, another day it's North Korea --- but
they don't seem to get to the basic problem that nine countries have
15,000 nuclear weapons in their arsenals. It's a worldwide phenomenon,
as is the persistence of the idea of nuclear weapons as the ultimate
guarantor of national security. Right now there's also a sense that only
Koreans are vulnerable, that most Americans aren't at risk of being
bombarded by nuclear missiles. At the height of popular protest in the
1980s, millions of people were in the streets --- in part because U.S.
and Soviet arsenals could reach both sides quite easily. That got people
to wake up and realize that nuclear war wasn't such a hot idea after
all. How big a role did fear play in these spikes of organizing? How can
people dealing with fear of the Trump administration, or of North Korean
nuclear mobilization, help direct that energy into making nuclear
conflict less likely? I think [fear has probably been]{.underline}
**[the most important factor in mobilizing people.]{.underline}** When
you look at things psychologically, people should be afraid of nuclear
weapons and nuclear war. It seems irrational to go bury your head in the
sand and not worry about them. But it's also true, in two ways, that
fear is dangerous. One is that it can be demobilizing, that people get
so scared they're scared silent. They become so frightened they retreat
and they don't feel powerful any more. They might take drugs instead of
taking action. A second danger is that, if people are scared of nuclear
war, the hawks have an answer for them. They turn fear on its head: Yes,
they say, nuclear war could be a bad thing, that's why we need nuclear
weapons to deter the bad Russians, Iranians, North Koreans and so on.
This means fear may reinforce the desire for nuclear weapons rather than
for getting rid of them. [For these reasons, the use of nuclear fear has
to be]{.underline} very [**careful**. Peace activists have to make the
case that **as long as nuc**lear weapon**s exist there's no real
security from nuclear war**, and therefore we need to **get rid of
nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. That's the best case that can be made by
nuclear disarmament forces: The arms race is a race no one wins. What
are some of the forgotten "paths not taken" of weapons not built or
decisions not made as a result of anti-nuclear organizing? How might the
world be different if those things had been built? The neutron bomb was
being proposed during the Carter administration. This enhanced radiation
weapon was designed to destroy people rather than property, and was
scheduled by the Carter administration to be deployed in Western
European nations. But once peace groups learned of it and began to focus
on its terrible effects, this caused massive protests in Western
European nations and, eventually, an unwillingness to support the
neutron bomb deployment by their government officials. As a result, the
Carter administration finally concluded that, if Western governments
weren't willing to stand up for it, the U.S. government wasn't going to
be the villain of the piece. So Carter canceled plans for its
deployment. The MX missile was the jewel in the crown of the Reagan
administration during its first term of office. Peace groups said that
it was a first-strike weapon, and there was so much popular protest
against it that Reagan couldn't get funding through Congress.
Eventually, a plan that began as 200 missiles barely slipped through
with 50 missiles. That failure became the basis of the U.S. government's
push for strategic arms reduction treaties, for it meant the U.S.
government couldn't keep pace with development of intercontinental
ballistic missiles. And the next best thing was seeing to it that
neither country had those weapons. The best way to do that was to sign a
treaty: the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, which Gorbachev
welcomed and showed him, in many ways, to be a peace person, strongly
influenced by the movement. Gorbachev had his own peace-oriented ideas,
but he also received a large amount of information from the disarmament
movement in the United States and around the world. He would take time
out of his meetings with heads of state to meet with representatives of
groups like the Freeze campaign, SANE, and International Physicians for
the Prevention of Nuclear War. So, Gorbachev and Reagan's detente and
the overall drawback from the nuclear brink were heavily influenced by
the peace movement --- not just through public pressure but also through
direct engagement. Are there other potentially winnable campaigns of
this kind available to anti-nuclear weapons activists today that might
limit the likelihood of the Trump administration using nuclear weapons?
It seems to me there are two ways [to **develop mass
pressure**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} **[Trump]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Congress]{.underline}** [in connection with the
general problem of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The first has to do
with the trillion dollar nuclear "modernization" program --- the plan to
upgrade the entire nuclear weapons complex, build new bombers and
missiles and submarines and so on. That cost is so great that it
provides the opportunity to reach people who are already concerned about
the arms race or are satisfied with the weapons we already have and
don't want to bankrupt the country. So [you can **make
demands**]{.underline} for cutbacks in the "modernization" plan or
stopping it entirely and mobilize a sympathetic constituency. A second
way is to focus on Trump's mental instability: The fact that he's a
reckless, dangerous leader, who really shouldn't have the button to
launch nuclear war in his hand. That's what the currently proposed
Markey-Lieu bill seeks to address: Under its provisions, unless there's
a nuclear attack on the United States, the president cannot initiate
nuclear war without a Congressional declaration of war. Since Congress
hasn't declared war since 1941, that's a pretty big restriction.

**Ravenal 9** -- Professor Emeritus at the Georgetown University School
of Foreign Service

Earl Ravenal, "Designing Defense for a New World Order," Critical
Review: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Politics and Society

[The underlying notion of "the security bureaucracies . . . looking for
new enemies" is a **threadbare concept**]{.underline} that has somehow
taken hold across the political spectrum, from the radical left (viz.
Michael Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat bank"), to the liberal
center (viz. Robert H. Johnson \[1997\], who dismisses most alleged
"threats" as "improbable dangers"), to libertarians (viz. Ted Galen
Carpenter \[1992\], Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy of the
Cato Institute, who wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies). [What
is missing from]{.underline} most analysts' [claims of "threat
inflation," however, is **a convincing theory of why**]{.underline},
say, [the]{.underline} American [government]{.underline}
significantly(not merely in excusable rhetoric) [might magnify and even
invent threats]{.underline} (and, more seriously, act on such inflated
threat estimates). In a few places, Eland (2004, 185) suggests that such
behavior might stem from military or national security bureaucrats'
attempts to enhance their personal status and organizational budgets, or
even from the influence and dominance of "the military-industrial
complex"; viz.: "Maintaining the empire and retaliating for the blowback
from that empire keeps what President Eisenhower called the
military-industrial complex fat and happy." Or, in the same section: In
the nation's capital, vested interests, such as the law enforcement
bureaucracies . . . routinely take advantage of "crises"to satisfy
parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to get pet
projects\-\-- a.k.a. pork\-\--funded by the government. And national
security crises, because of people's fears, are especially ripe
opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182) Thus,
"[bureaucratic-politics" theory]{.underline}, which once made several
reputa- tions (such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin, and
Graham Allison) in defense-intellectual circles, and spawned an entire
sub-industry within the field of international relations,5 [is put into
the service of dismissing putative security threats as
imaginary]{.underline}. So, too, can a surprisingly cognate theory,
"public choice,"6 which can be considered the right-wing analog of the
"bureaucratic-politics" model, and is a preferred interpretation of
governmental decision- making among libertarian observers. As Eland
(2004, 203) summarizes: Public-choice theory argues \[that\] the
government itself can develop sepa- rate interests from its citizens.
The government reflects the interests of powerful pressure groups and
the interests of the bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although
this problem occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more
severe in foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies
that affect them less directly. There is, in this statement of
public-choice theory, a certain ambiguity, and a certain degree of
contradiction: Bureaucrats are supposedly, at the same time, subservient
to societal interest groups and autonomous from society in general. This
journal has pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely
consequence of the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity
(e.g., Somin 1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But
state autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute
their own interests for those of what could be called the "national
society" that they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that,
precisely because of the public-ignorance and elite-expertise factors,
and especially because the opportunities\-\--at least for bureaucrats (a
few notable post-government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)\-\--for
lucrative self-dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and
diplomatic areas of government than they are in some of the
contract-dispensing and more under-the-radar-screen agencies of
government, the "public-choice" imputation of self-dealing, rather than
working toward the national interest (which, however may not be
synonymous with the interests, perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is
less likely to hold. In short, state autonomy is likely to mean, in the
derivation of foreign policy, that "state elites" are using rational
judgment, in insulation from self-promoting interest groups\-\--about
what strategies, forces, and weapons are required for national defense.
Ironically, "public choice"\-\--not even a species of economics, but
rather a kind of political interpretation\-\--is not even about "public"
choice, since, like the bureaucratic-politics model, it repudiates the
very notion that bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they
are held, axiomatically, to exhibit "rent-seeking" behavior, wherein
they abuse their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at
least to build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches.
Such sub- rational models actually explain very little of what they
purport to observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding
the "behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances,
under some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that
they posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives. My treatment of "role" differs from that of the
bureaucratic-politics theorists, whose model of the derivation of
foreign policy depends heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and
specific identification of the role- playing of organizationally
situated individuals in a partly conflictual "pulling and hauling"
process that "results in" some policy outcome. Even here,
bureaucratic-politics theorists Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow (1999,
311) allow that "some players are not able to articulate \[sic\] the
governmental politics game because their conception of their job does
not legitimate such activity." This is a crucial admission, and one that
points\-\-- empirically\-\--to the need for a broader and generic
treatment of role. Roles (all theorists state) give rise to
"expectations" of performance. My point is that [virtually every
governmental role, and especially national-security roles]{.underline},
[and particularly the roles of the uniformed mili- tary,
embody]{.underline} expectations of devotion to the "national interest";
rational- ity in the derivation of policy at every functional level; and
[**objectivity** in the treatment of parameters, especially external
parameters such as "threats" and the power and capabilities of other
nations.]{.underline} [Sub-rational models]{.underline} (such as "public
choice") [fail]{.underline} [to take into account even a partial
dedication to the "national" interest]{.underline} ([or even the
possibility that the national interest may be honestly misconceived in
more paro- chial terms). In contrast, an official's role connects the
individual to the (state-level) process, and moderates the]{.underline}
(perhaps otherwise) [self-seeking impulses of the individual.
Role-derived behavior tends to be formalized and codified; relatively
transparent and at least **peer-reviewed**, so as to be consistent with
expectations; surviving the particular individual and trans- mitted to
successors and ancillaries; measured against a standard and thus
corrigible; defined in terms of the performed function and therefore
derived from the state function; and uncorrrupt, because personal
cheating and even egregious aggrandizement are conspicuously
discouraged]{.underline}. My own direct observation suggests that
[defense decision-makers attempt to "frame" the structure of the
problems that they try to solve on the basis of the **most accurate
intelligence**. They **make it their business to know** where the
threats come from. Thus, threats **are not "socially
constructed**"]{.underline} (even though, of course, some values are). A
major reason for the rationality, and the objectivity, of the process is
that much security planning is done, not in vaguely undefined circum-
stances that offer scope for idiosyncratic, subjective behavior, but
rather in structured and reviewed organizational frameworks.
Non-rationalities (which are bad for understanding and prediction) tend
to get filtered out. [**People are fired for presenting skewed
analysis** and for making bad predictions. This is because something
important is riding on the causal analysis and the contingent
prediction.]{.underline} For these reasons, "[public choice" does not
have the "feel" of reality to many critics who have participated in the
structure of defense decision-making. In that structure]{.underline},
obvious, and even not-so-obvious,["rent-seeking" would not only be
shameful; it would present a **severe risk of career
termination**.]{.underline} And, as mentioned, the defense bureaucracy
is hardly a productive place for truly talented rent-seekers to
operatecompared to opportunities for personal profit in the commercial
world. A bureaucrat's very self-placement in these reaches of government
testi- fies either to a sincere commitment to the national interest or
to a lack of sufficient imagination to exploit opportunities for
personal profit.

The realist approach

[In the realist view]{.underline}, the **[basic
principles]{.underline}** [of international politics **never
change**]{.underline}. [International affairs]{.underline} always
[remain essentially]{.underline} [a **struggle for power**]{.underline}
[among **self-interested states**]{.underline}. [Since realism is not a
unitary theory]{.underline}, **[different branches]{.underline}** [of
realism rely on **different** independent **variables**]{.underline}.
Classical realists like Hans **[Morgenthau]{.underline}** [see perpetual
conflict rooted in an innately]{.underline} **[selfish]{.underline}**
[human]{.underline} **[nature]{.underline}**, [which translates into
competitive state behavior]{.underline} (Morgenthau 1985). [Neorealists
such as Kenneth **Waltz**]{.underline} [focus on an inherently
**competitive international system**]{.underline} [without a central
organizing authority that **monopolizes power**]{.underline} [to manage
inter-state relations and **protect states** from one
another]{.underline} (Waltz 1979). [Within this anarchic international
system, **states** are]{.underline} [the **primary actors**]{.underline}
[and employ self-help strategies to survive and]{.underline}, depending
on the exact branch of neorealism, to **[maximize power]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**. [Because of an inevitably
**asymmetric distribution**]{.underline} [of power]{.underline}, [the
anarchic condition of international affairs may]{.underline}
**[compel]{.underline}** **[weaker states]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} either **[balance]{.underline}** against
[or]{.underline} **[bandwagon]{.underline}** with more powerful ones.
[Neoclassical realists marry neorealism's systemic assumptions with
domestic level factors that either facilitate or circumscribe foreign
policy]{.underline}, for instance domestic institutions,
government-society relations, and leadership perception (Ripsman et
al. 2016).

[Realism is]{.underline} generally **[pessimistic]{.underline}** [about
the prospects for **coop**eration]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[mutual support]{.underline}** [among states.]{.underline} [It
would]{.underline} immediately **[predict]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} national **[self-help and "us first"]{.underline}**
**[mentality]{.underline}** [that characterizes the global management of
**Covid-19** and its consequences]{.underline}. Travel and entry bans,
international scapegoating, great power competition and pharmaceutical
protectionism are ubiquitous.

[Even in the world's most integrated supranational organization, the
European Union (EU), member states **readily violate** otherwise
sacrosanct principles of cooperation]{.underline}, [and realists would
not be surprised by how quickly lofty European ideals and norms made way
for national self-help once the Covid-19 crisis hit the
continent]{.underline}. The outbreak was followed by immediate violation
of many existing EU regulations: competition law, fiscal discipline, and
freedom of movement[. As countries closed their borders, EU capitals
went into full nationalist gear]{.underline} (Guardian 2020a). Without
any EU-consultation process, a number of EU countries immediately closed
their borders and decreed export bans. When Italy, one of the worst
affected countries in the world, asked fellow EU members for emergency
relief with critical medical supplies, for several weeks it was met with
precisely what realism would expect: its neighbors violated the EU's
single-market spirit by decreeing export bans on pharmaceutical
equipment (Braw 2020; Reuters 2020).

[Dismayed by the lack of European solidarity, Rome was happy to accept
support from China, which, though itself badly affected, sent medical
equipment and experts immediately. Far from being altruistic, however,
Beijing aims to rewrite the Covid-19 narrative]{.underline}. It does not
want to be seen as the point-of-origin of the Covid-19 virus and views
the pandemic as an opportunity to come out ahead of the United States in
a zero-sum competition for global primacy. In Italy and elsewhere,
China's "mask diplomacy" is a noteworthy public relations coup (Kliem
and Chong 2020). Beijing wants to be recognized globally as a
responsible provider of public health goods in the absence of US
leadership, and thereby, progress towards its ultimate objective of
comprehensive power accumulation relative to Washington.

Indeed, the US has not only been absent in terms of leadership, but has
also actively engaged in nationalistic self-help at the expense of
others. President Donald Trump of the United States, Europe's closest
non-EU ally and partner, tried to lure CureVac, a German firm that was
developing a promising Covid-19 vaccine technology, to relocate its
Covid-19 research and development division to the US and to guarantee
exclusive American access to the firm's products (Die Welt 2020).
Similarly, Trump sought to block the sale of masks to Canada by a
US-based firm (MacCharles and Ballingall 2020), though a compromise was
arrived at later. The US (like other countries, e.g. Japan) has also
sought to restructure global supply chains in order to bypass dependence
on China (Pamuk and Shalal 2020), which---if it succeeds---will be a
radical and long-term change.

[Realists]{.underline} also [point out that **international
institutions**]{.underline} [do not **enable states** to **concentrate**
on greater **long-term gains** for everyone]{.underline}. Instead,
[international]{.underline} **[anarchy]{.underline}** [forces states to
**treat** international]{.underline} **[organizations]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[institutions]{.underline}** essentially **[like the
international system]{.underline}** itself: [as an arena for zero-sum
**competition**]{.underline}. [Indeed, as realism predicts, the World
Health Organization (WHO) has become **highly
politicized**.]{.underline} [For example, because of the PRC's refusal
to accept Taiwan as a diplomatically independent, sovereign nation
state, the WHO disregards Taiwan's experience with Covid-19 as well as
related research and development results. Allegedly bowing to pressure
from Beijing, the WHO does not recognize Taiwan and refuses to include
Taipei's very successful pandemic management strategies in its reports
on global research efforts]{.underline} (Financial Times 2020). This
also supports the neoclassical realists' argument about domestic
factors. It shows how domestic ideology shapes foreign policy decisions
in China and hinders international cooperation.

[If a severe **transboundary**]{.underline} [global]{.underline}
**[crisis]{.underline}** [cannot spur international cooperation, then
**what can**]{.underline}? [Realism reminds us that, because of the
**trust deficit**]{.underline} systemically **[inherent]{.underline}**
[in an international system characterized by **anarchy**]{.underline},
[states **hesitate**]{.underline} [to forgo their **first
instinct**]{.underline} [for self-help and zero-sum games]{.underline},
**[even amidst]{.underline}** a [common]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}** **[challenge]{.underline}**.

The liberal approach

Liberal theory highlights four imperatives for cooperation:
interdependence, transnationalization, the growth of international
institutions, and democracy (Doyle and Recchia 2011; Nye 1988).

When the fates of states are bound together, liberals claim, they must
cooperate or pay a very high price. The global economy, for instance, is
a complex network of trade, finance and manufacturing that places a
premium on cooperation. From this perspective, states must cooperate to
stem pandemics that flow seamlessly across the world and impose high
costs on all societies. They must share knowledge and material resources
to counter a scourge that harms them all. They certainly do so, for
example, in US-led efforts to ensure the reliable availability of
equipment to combat pandemics (Tribune 2020). But they do not cooperate
consistently. The [United States has sought to corner scarce medical
supplies (Bradley 2020), European states have failed to coordinate
policy (The Guardian 2020a), and China and the United States are
squabbling over responsibility (Shi and Wu 2020). In short, the pattern
is much as in another arena of contest between interdependent states:
the as yet unfinished "trade war."]{.underline}

Why? Interdependence does not automatically produce cooperation. It is
only when the breakdown of interdependence raises the prospect of
serious catastrophe that states cooperate. When nuclear-armed states are
on the verge of war, for instance, they engage in tacit cooperation by
practicing extreme caution and often seek explicit accommodation through
talks, as was the case in Cold War crises. Even so, they continue to
compete through arms racing, alliance building and occasional
brinkmanship. Comparatively low levels of interdependence amidst the
Covid-19 outbreak are unlikely to generate high levels of cooperation as
the threat to national survival is limited.

[The onset of pandemics has certainly produced unprecedented cooperation
among epistemic communities, such as virologists, in a
transnationalized]{.underline} world. Scientists from many countries
have worked together to manage the threat of a viral outbreak ever since
the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002. [The
appearance of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012
quickly led to the activation of a scientific network that has been
dubbed the "SARS club"]{.underline} (Butler 2012). More broadly, the
onset of MERS spurred global research, producing as many as 883
scientific papers in 92 countries between 2012 and 2015 (Zyoud 2016).
[Likewise, as the New York Times has noted, the Covid-19 outbreak has
galvanized unparalleled cooperative research in which scientists have
bypassed standard protocols and competitive secrecy to engage in shared
efforts (Apuzzo and Kirkpatrick 2020).]{.underline} But, not for the
first time, politics has trumped cooperation. The possibility of a
quantum leap in global scientific collaboration has been stymied by the
China-US spat, which has reduced the prospects of shared funding and
finance to fight the virus. [The US, for instance, stopped funding of a
critical coronavirus-related training program for Chinese and other
scientists even before the current outbreak. National priorities have
overridden collective action, which is entirely in accord with realist
expectations (Baumgaertner and Rainey 2020).]{.underline}

[The same malaise afflicts international institutions, which liberals
see as fostering high levels of cooperation. The Group of 7 major
economies (G7) failed to organize a summit meeting in March 2020, while
a subsequent meeting of their foreign ministers came up with no more
than an anodyne statement seeking to foster research cooperation and do
"whatever is necessary" to counter the economic fallout of the crisis
even as they disagreed on whether China was to blame for the onset of
the crisis]{.underline} (Schult 2020). The G20 did not do much better.
It did support debt relief for poor countries, but its announced \$5
trillion injection into the global economy was in fact no more than the
sum of moneys already committed by its individual members for themselves
(Chodor 2020). The institution at the center of the crisis, the WHO, has
been acknowledged as critical to the information flow relating to the
crisis. But the WHO has also been dogged by controversy for announcing
the onset of the pandemic late (on 11 March, by which time it had
already spread to 113 countries) and for apparently deferring to China
in doing so (Basrur 2020). Such failings have brought much criticism and
calls for its reform (South China Morning Post 2020).

Finally, [democracy is said to be a binding factor, at least among
developed economies. This is largely true with respect to the
relationship between democracy and war]{.underline}. But the evidence is
not persuasive in the present context. Developed democratic states in
Europe and North America have engaged in recurring tugs of war over the
sharing of counter-pandemic resources such as protective equipment and
ventilators and have done relatively little to take collective action
(Cohen and Musmar 2020). Overall, liberal theory does not have much to
offer to explain the weak nature of international cooperation in the
crisis.

Ideational approaches

[The constructivist approach is an essentially ideational theory (or set
of theories) that stresses the importance of belief structures,
identities and roles, holding that, fundamentally, the ways in which
actors behave in international politics are shaped by a consensus about
reality and appropriate responses to it]{.underline} (Onuf 1989). From
this standpoint, responses to the Covid-19 crisis are determined by
deeply embedded beliefs about the priorities that states should adhere
to in such a situation. The possibilities of cooperation, from a
constructivist perspective, are not circumscribed by the anarchic
condition in which states coexist (as realists would have it), but by
our beliefs about what is feasible and what is not in such a condition
(Pouliot 2011). The central dictum of the constructivist---"anarchy is
what states make of it" (Wendt 1992)---thus sees the lack of collective
action in the face of the pandemic not as an inevitable product of the
material reality of the world as it actually is, but as arising from a
realist thought structure. To wit, states fail to cooperate despite the
urgency of the Covid-19 crisis because they are weighed down by the
unquestioned notion that, even under the onslaught of a pandemic,
self-help must come first, and the exercise of power must shape action.
This worldview, for the constructivist, is an ideational construct that
needs to be overridden if cooperation is to be achieved.

It is to the credit of constructivism that it widens the space for
potential change by critiquing the realist perception of unalterable
reality. However, while the concept of ideational structure is helpful
in challenging established modes of thinking (and consequent habits of
action) over time, it [is not particularly helpful in offering insights
into the short-to-medium-term responses of states to crises like the
pandemic or to anticipating what, in fashioning states' responses, might
actually be do-able and what probably will not.]{.underline} On the
contrary, since constructivist thinking views both cooperation and
conflict in terms of thought structures, it explains very little as far
as responses to the current crisis go. In short, constructivism is not a
predictive theory and tends to be non-falsifiable and, more
pragmatically, lacking in much utility other than urging new thinking.
How to get from the present ideational structure to a more desirable one
when a crisis breaks out remains a knotty problem.

[Normative theory, which centers on moral judgment about what should
be---as distinct from the materialist view of international politics as
what is---is similarly problematic]{.underline} (Ramel 2011). Certainly,
it offers useful space for the identification of responsibility when a
crisis breaks out. The analyst may adopt two basic approaches that
Robert Gregory labels "backward-mapping" and "forward-mapping" (Gregory
1998). The former looks at the origin and history of the policy process
and how they might have created or contributed to the problem. In the
present case, one would ask: who was responsible for the outbreak of the
pandemic? A second question would be: was policymaker X warned about the
problem and did he/she take action to avert it or mitigate its potential
consequences? The latter approach considers the policy action taken at
the time of the crisis. Did the policymaker act appropriately once the
crisis had broken out? While both are normative questions, they also
have strong practical implications. The attribution of responsibility
relates to the consequences of the policymaker's actions and to whether
the individual held responsible was fittingly sanctioned or punished for
it, whether legally or politically. This has important implications. If
the person or persons responsible is/are not in some way punished,
he/she/they may tend to repeat this or similar errors and cause a
recurrence of societal harm. Here, China would certainly be one center
of analysis, as questions mount as to whether Beijing took the necessary
steps to share information once the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus
was first confirmed by Chinese medical doctors in late December (The
Guardian 2020b). As mentioned above, the WHO too is open to the charge
of prioritizing political expediency by not including Taiwan in its
assessments and recommendations.

The [problem, however, of explaining why states behave as they do
remains]{.underline}. The attribution of responsibility for a crisis is
normally only a post facto phenomenon and does little to inform the
analyst as to why international cooperation as a pattern of behavior
does or does not occur. Even more, the scope for anticipating future
behavior remains uncertain at best. Like constructivism, normative
theory is valuable in understanding critical aspects of international
cooperation or the lack of it, but it misses some of the most important
facets of international reality: it fails to explain why states tend to
let competition override cooperation when individual and collective
interests collide.

Conclusion: realism redux

Much post-Cold War academic thinking gave the appearance of a
"transition" in the way intellectuals view global politics: a "decline"
of realism and the rise of alternative approaches in apex-level
scholarly research (Maliniak et al 2011). However, this analysis shows
that [alternative paradigms in IRT have **much less grasp**]{.underline}
[over the current crisis than **realism**]{.underline}. The [continued
**dominance of the state**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} of
**[individual]{.underline}** [national]{.underline}
**[interests]{.underline}** [over **collective interests**]{.underline}
in the absence of effective international authority [is
**evident**]{.underline} [in global responses to the
pandemic]{.underline}. [Realism]{.underline} [tells us
that]{.underline}, [because of the systemic **trust
deficit**]{.underline} [in international affairs]{.underline},
especially in times of crises, [states will turn to
**self-help**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[zero-sum
calculations]{.underline}** [rather than]{.underline} to [cooperative
**collective action**]{.underline}. It is evident that [precisely such
behavior **dominates** the global **management**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} the **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 crisis. To be sure,
[cooperation]{.underline} does [occur]{.underline}, but
**[only]{.underline}** [when it **does not clash** with **national
interest**]{.underline}.

Going forward, a realist would expect further restrictions on
international exchange in order to minimize the threat and at least a
temporary but nonetheless significant scale-down of globalization, as it
were. The economic effects of the crisis are likely to be severe and
unpredictable, and likely to include recession, flight of capital,
widespread impoverishment, fall in agricultural output, and increased
deaths from other diseases such as malaria and HIV (Congressional
Research Service 2020; Economist 2020; Shiller 2020). These will be
subject to the same dynamics of cooperation and conflict as described
here, in particular in the context of Sino-US competition.

Rather worryingly, the Covid-19 crisis also points to what global action
on other critical issues such as climate change, severe economic
dislocation, or the apocalyptic consequences of nuclear war could look
like in the future. They will in all probability not induce intense
global cooperation to manage common challenges, but instead spur
nationalism, zero-sum competition and the application of power to secure
the objectives of individual nations.

On the positive side, realism also tells us that states try to imitate
the successful activities of their peers. Governments may look jealously
upon one another, but they will also adopt those measures used by others
that are seen to be working. In that sense, we can place hope in the
ability of Europeans and Americans to emulate successful measures taken
by states like New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan to contain the spread
of Covid-19.

Clearly, while all branches of IRT have something to offer, [realism is
**best equipped**]{.underline} [to explain and
**anticipate**]{.underline} [the ambit of international
**coop**eration]{.underline} [in a crisis of the **magnitude
of**]{.underline} the **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 pandemic. [Discounting
its value can only **subtract**]{.underline} [from the **potential of
IR**]{.underline} [as a discipline to **meet** its **social
function**]{.underline}.

Evolution and Technology, 6-xx-2014, https://jetpress.org/v24/araujo.htm

Some [moral enhancement theorists argue]{.underline} that [a society of
**morally enhanced individuals**]{.underline} [would be in a better
position to cope with important problems that humankind is likely to
face in]{.underline} the future such as, for instance, the threats posed
by **[climate change]{.underline}**, grand scale **[terrorist
attacks]{.underline}**, or the risk of **[catastrophic
wars.]{.underline}** [The assumption here is]{.underline} quite simple:
[our inability to cope successfully with these problems stems mainly
from a sort of deficit in human beings' **moral
motivation**]{.underline}. [If human beings were morally
better]{.underline} -- if we had enhanced moral dispositions -- [there
would be **fewer wars, less terrorism**, and more **willingness to save
our environment**.]{.underline} Although simple and attractive, **[this
assumption is]{.underline}**, as I intend to show,
**[false]{.underline}**. [At the root of threats to the survival of
humankind in the future is not a deficit in our moral
dispositions]{.underline}, [but the endurance of an **old political
arrangement** that prevents the pursuit of shared goals on a collective
basis.]{.underline} The political arrangement I have in mind here is the
international system of states. In my analysis of the political
implications of moral enhancement, I intend to concentrate my attention
only on the supposition that we could avoid major wars in the future by
making individuals morally better. I do not intend to discuss the
threats posed by climate change, or by terrorism, although some human
enhancement theorists also seek to cover these topics. I will explain,
in the course of my analysis, a conceptual distinction between "human
nature realism" and "structural realism," well-known in the field of
international relations theory. Thomas Douglas seems to have been among
the first to explore the idea of "moral enhancement" as a new form of
human enhancement. He certainly helped to kick off the current phase of
the debate. In a paper published in 2008, Douglas suggests that in the
"future people might use biomedical technology to morally enhance
themselves." Douglas characterizes moral enhancement in terms of the
acquisition of "morally better motives" (Douglas 2008, 229). Mark
Walker, in a paper published in 2009, suggests a similar idea. He
characterizes moral enhancement in terms of improved moral dispositions
or "genetic virtues": The Genetic Virtue Program (GVP) is a proposal for
influencing our moral nature through biology, that is, it is an
alternate yet complementary means by which ethics and ethicists might
contribute to the task of making our lives and world a better place. The
basic idea is simple enough: genes influence human behavior, so altering
the genes of individuals may alter the influence genes exert on
behavior. (Walker 2009, 27--28) Walker does not argue in favor of any
specific moral theory, such as, for instance, virtue ethics. Whether one
endorses a deontological or a utilitarian approach to ethics, he argues,
the concept of virtue is relevant to the extent that virtues motivate us
either to do the right thing or to maximize the good (Walker 2009, 35).
Moral enhancement theory, however, does not reduce the ethical debate to
the problem of moral dispositions. Morality also concerns, to a large
extent, questions about reasons for action. And moral enhancement, most
certainly, will not improve our moral beliefs; neither could it be used
to settle moral disagreements. This seems to have led some authors to
criticize the moral enhancement idea on the ground that it neglects the
cognitive side of our moral behavior. Robert Sparrow, for instance,
argues that, from a Kantian point of view, moral enhancement would have
to provide us with better moral beliefs rather than enhanced moral
motivation (Sparrow 2014, 25; see also Agar 2010, 74). Yet, it seems to
me that this objection misses the point of the moral enhancement idea.
[Many people, across different countries, already share moral beliefs
relating]{.underline}, for instance, [to the wrongness of harming or
killing other people arbitrarily,]{.underline} or to the moral
requirement to help people in need. They may share moral beliefs while
not sharing the same reasons for these beliefs, or perhaps even not
being able to articulate the beliefs in the conceptual framework of a
moral theory (Blackford 2010, 83). But although they share some moral
beliefs, in some circumstances they may lack the appropriate motivation
to act accordingly. Moral enhancement, thus, aims at improving moral
motivation, and leaves open the question as to how to improve our moral
judgments. In a recent paper, published in The Journal of Medical
Ethics, neuroscientist Molly Crockett reports the state of the art in
the still very embryonic field of moral enhancement. She points out, for
example, that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
citalopram seems to increase harm aversion. There is, moreover, some
evidence that this substance may be effective in the treatment of
specific types of aggressive behavior. Like Douglas, Crockett emphasizes
that moral enhancement should aim at individuals' moral motives
(Crockett 2014; see also Spence 2008; Terbeck et al. 2013). Another
substance that is frequently mentioned in the moral enhancement
literature is oxytocin. Some [studies suggest that willingness to
cooperate with other people]{.underline},and to trust unknown
prospective cooperators, [may be enhanced by an increase in the levels
of oxytoci]{.underline}n in the organism (Zak 2008, 2011; Zak and Kugler
2011; Persson and Savulescu 2012, 118--119). Oxytocin has also been
reported to be "associated with the subjective experience of empathy"
(Zak 2011, 55; Zak and Kugler 2011, 144). The question I would like to
examine now concerns the supposition that moral enhancement --
comprehended in these terms and assuming for the sake of argument that,
some day, it might become effective and safe -- may also help us in
coping with the threat of devastating wars in the future. [The
assumption that there is a relationship between,]{.underline} on the one
hand, [threats to the survival of humankind and]{.underline}, on the
other, [a sort of "deficit" in our moral dispositions is
c]{.underline}learly [made by]{.underline} some [moral enhancements
theorists]{.underline}. Douglas, for instance, argues that "according to
many plausible theories, some of the world's most important problems ---
such as developing world poverty, climate change and war --- can be
attributed to these moral deficits" (2008, 230). Walker, in a similar
vein, writes about the possibility of "using biotechnology to alter our
biological natures in an effort to reduce evil in the world" (2009, 29).
And Julian Savulescu and Ingmar Persson go as far as to defend the "the
need for moral enhancement" of humankind in a series of articles, and in
a book published in 2012. One of the reasons Savulescu and Persson
advance for the moral enhancement of humankind is that our moral
dispositions seem to have remained basically unchanged over the last
millennia (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 2). These dispositions have
proved thus far quite useful for the survival of human beings as a
species. They have enabled us to cooperate with each other in the
collective production of things such as food, shelter, tools, and
farming. They have also played a crucial role in the creation and
refinement of a variety of human institutions such as settlements,
villages, and laws. Although the possibility of free-riding has never
been fully eradicated, the benefits provided by cooperation have largely
exceeded the disadvantages of our having to deal with occasional
uncooperative or untrustworthy individuals (Persson and Savulescu 2012,
39). The problem, however, is that the same dispositions that have
enabled human beings in the past to engage in the collective production
of so many artifacts and institutions now seem powerless in the face of
the human capacity to destroy other human beings on a grand scale, or
perhaps even to annihilate the entire human species. There is, according
to Savulescu and Persson, a "mismatch" between our cognitive faculties
and our evolved moral attitudes: "\[...\] as we have repeatedly
stressed, owing to the progress of science, the range of our powers of
action has widely outgrown the range of our spontaneous moral attitudes,
and created a dangerous mismatch" (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 103; see
also Persson and Savulescu 2010, 660; Persson and Savulescu 2011b;
DeGrazie 2012, 2; Rakić 2014, 2). This worry about the mismatch between,
on the one hand, the modern technological capacity to destroy and, on
the other, our limited moral commitments is not new. The political
philosopher Hans Morgenthau, best known for his defense of political
realism, called attention to the same problem nearly fifty years ago. In
the wake of the first successful tests with thermonuclear bombs,
conducted by the USA and the former Soviet Union, Morgenthau referred to
the "contrast" between the technological progress of our age and our
feeble moral attitudes as one of the most disturbing dilemmas of our
time: The first dilemma consists in the contrast between the
technological unification of the world and the parochial moral
commitments and political institutions of the age. Moral commitments and
political institutions, dating from an age which modern technology has
left behind, have not kept pace with technological achievements and,
hence, are incapable of controlling their destructive potentialities.
(Morgenthau 1962, 174) Moral enhancement theorists and political
realists like Morgenthau, therefore, share the thesis that our natural
moral dispositions are not strong enough to prevent human beings from
endangering their own existence as a species. But they differ as to the
best way out of this quandary: moral enhancement theorists argue for the
re-engineering of our moral dispositions, whereas Morgenthau accepted
the immutability of human nature and argued, instead, for the
re-engineering of world politics. Both positions, as I intend to show,
are wrong in assuming that the "dilemma" results from the weakness of
our spontaneous moral dispositions in the face of the unprecedented
technological achievements of our time. On the other hand, [both
positions are correct in recognizing the **real possibility** of global
catastrophes resulting from the malevolent use of, for instance,
**biotechnology or nuclear capabilities.**]{.underline} The supposition
that individuals' unwillingness to cooperate with each other, even when
they would be better-off by choosing to cooperate, results from a sort
of deficit of dispositions such as altruism, empathy, and benevolence
has been at the core of some important political theories. This idea is
an important assumption in the works of early modern political realists
such as Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes. It was also later endorsed by
some well-known authors writing about the origins of war in the first
half of the twentieth century. It was then believed, as Sigmund Freud
suggested in a text from 1932, that the main cause of wars is a human
tendency to "hatred and destruction" (in German: ein Trieb zum Hassen
und Vernichtung). [Freud went as far as to suggest that human beings
have an ingrained "inclination" to "aggression" and
"destruction"]{.underline} (Aggressionstrieb, Aggressionsneigung, and
Destruktionstrieb), and that this inclination has a "good biological
basis" (biologisch wohl begründet) (Freud 1999, 20--24; see also Freud
1950; Forbes 1984; Pick 1993, 211--227; Medoff 2009). The [attempt to
employ Freud's conception of human nature in understanding international
relations has recently been resumed]{.underline}, for instance by Kurt
Jacobsen in a paper entitled "Why Freud Matters: Psychoanalysis and
International Relations Revisited," published in 2013. Morgenthau
himself was deeply influenced by Freud's speculations on the origins of
war.1 Early in the 1930s, Morgenthau wrote an essay called "On the
Origin of the Political from the Nature of Human Beings" (Über die
Herkunft des Politischen aus dem Wesen des Menschen), which contains
several references to Freud's theory about the human propensity to
aggression.2 Morgenthau's most influential book, Politics among Nations:
The Struggle for Power and Peace, first published in 1948 and then
successively revised and edited, is still considered a landmark work in
the tradition of political realism. According to Morgenthau, politics is
governed by laws that have their origin in human nature: "Political
realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by
objective laws that have their roots in human nature" (Morgenthau 2006,
4). Just like human enhancement theorists, Morgenthau also takes for
granted that human nature has not changed over recent millennia: "Human
nature, in which the laws of politics have their roots, has not changed
since the classical philosophies of China, India, and Greece endeavored
to discover these laws" (Morgenthau 2006, 4). And since, for Morgenthau,
human nature prompts human beings to act selfishly, rather than
cooperatively, political leaders will sometimes favor conflict over
cooperation, unless some superior power compels them to act otherwise.
Now, this is exactly what happens in the domain of international
relations. For in the international sphere there is not a supranational
institution with the real power to prevent states from pursuing means of
self-defense. The acquisition of means of self-defense, however, is
frequently perceived by other states as a threat to their own security.
This leads to the security dilemma and the possibility of war. As
Morgenthau put the problem in an article published in 1967: "The actions
of states are determined not by moral principles and legal commitments
but by considerations of interest and power" (1967, 3). Because
Morgenthau and early modern political philosophers such as Machiavelli
and Hobbes defended political realism on the grounds provided by a
specific conception human nature, their version of political realism has
been frequently called "human nature realism." The literature on human
nature realism has become quite extensive (Speer 1968; Booth 1991;
Freyberg-Inan 2003; Kaufman 2006; Molloy 2006, 82--85; Craig 2007;
Scheuerman 2007, 2010, 2012; Schuett 2007; Neascu 2009; Behr 2010,
210--225; Brown 2011; Jütersonke 2012). It is not my intention here to
present a fully-fledged account of the tradition of human nature
realism, but rather to emphasize the extent to which some moral
enhancement theorists, in their description of some of the gloomy
scenarios humankind is likely to face in the future, implicitly endorse
this kind of political realism. Indeed, like human nature realists,
moral enhancement theorists assume that human nature has not changed
over the last millennia, and that violence and lack of cooperation in
the international sphere result chiefly from human nature's limited
inclination to pursue morally desirable goals. One may, of course,
criticize the human enhancement project by rejecting the assumption that
conflict and violence in the international domain should be explained by
means of a theory about human nature. In a reply to Savulescu and
Persson, [Sparrow correctly argues that **"structural issues,"** rather
than **human nature**, constitute the main factor underlying political
conflicts]{.underline} (Sparrow 2014, 29). But he does not explain what
exactly these "structural issues" are, as I intend to do later. Sparrow
is right in rejecting the human nature theory underlying the human
enhancement project. But this underlying assumption, in my view, is not
trivially false or simply "ludicrous," as he suggests. Human nature
realism has been implicitly or explicitly endorsed by leading political
philosophers ever since Thucydides speculated on the origins of war in
antiquity (Freyberg-Inan 2003, 23--36). True, it might be objected that
"human nature realism," as it was defended by Morgenthau and earlier
political philosophers, relied upon a metaphysical or psychoanalytical
conception of human nature, a conception that, actually, did not have
the support of any serious scientific investigation (Smith 1983, 167).
Yet, over the last few years there has been much empirical research in
fields such as developmental psychology and evolutionary biology that
apparently gives some support to the realist claim. Some of these
studies suggest that an inclination to aggression and conflict has its
origins in our evolutionary history. This idea, then, has recently led
some authors to resume "human nature realism" on new foundations, devoid
of the metaphysical assumptions of the early realists, and entirely
grounded in empirical research. Indeed, some recent works in the field
of international relations theory already seek to call attention to
evolutionary biology as a possible new start for political realism. This
point is clearly made, for instance, by Bradley Thayer, who published in
2004 a book called Darwin and International Relations: On the
Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict. And in a paper
published in 2000, he affirms the following: Evolutionary theory
provides a stronger foundation for realism because it is based on
science, not on theology or metaphysics. I use the theory to explain two
human traits: egoism and domination. I submit that the egoistic and
dominating behavior of individuals, which is commonly described as
"realist," is a product of the evolutionary process. I focus on these
two traits because they are critical components of any realist argument
in explaining international politics. (Thayer 2000, 125; see also Thayer
2004) Thayer basically argues that a tendency to egoism and domination
stems from human evolutionary history. The predominance of conflict and
competition in the domain of international politics, he argues, is a
reflex of dispositions that can now be proved to be part of our evolved
human nature in a way that Morgenthau and other earlier political
philosophers could not have established in their own time. Now, what
some moral enhancement theorists propose is a direct intervention in our
"evolved limited moral psychology" as a means to make us "fit" to cope
with some possible devastating consequences from the predominance of
conflict and competition in the domain of international politics
(Persson and Savulescu 2010, 664). Moral enhancement theorists
comprehend the nature of war and conflicts, especially those conflicts
that humankind is likely to face in the future, as the result of human
beings' limited moral motivations. Compared to supporters of human
nature realism, however, moral enhancement theorists are less skeptical
about the prospect of our taming human beings' proclivity to do evil.
For our knowledge in fields such as neurology and pharmacology does
already enable us to enhance people's performance in a variety of
activities, and there seems to be no reason to assume it will not enable
us to enhance people morally in the future. But [the
question]{.underline}, of course, is [whether moral enhancement
will]{.underline} also [improve the prospect of our coping
successfully]{.underline} [with]{.underline} some major threats to the
**[survival of humankind]{.underline}**, as Savulescu and Persson
propose, or **[to reduce evil in the world]{.underline}**, as proposed
by Walker. V. The point to which I would next like to call attention is
that "human nature realism" -- which is implicitly presupposed by some
moral enhancement theorists -- has been much criticized over the last
decades within the tradition of political realism itself. "Structural
realism," unlike "human nature realism," does not seek to derive a
theory about conflicts and violence in the context of international
relations from a theory of the moral shortcomings of human nature.
Structural realism was originally proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the
State and War, published in 1959, and then later in another book called
Theory of International Politics, published in 1979. In both works,
Waltz seeks to avoid committing himself to any specific conception of
human nature (Waltz 2001, x--xi). Waltz's thesis is that the thrust of
the political realism doctrine can be retained without our having to
commit ourselves to any theory about the shortcomings of human nature.
What is relevant for our understanding of international politics is,
instead, our understanding of the "structure" of the international
system of states (Waltz 1986). John Mearsheimer, too, is an important
contemporary advocate of political realism. Although he seeks to
distance himself from some ideas defended by Waltz, he also rejects
human nature realism and, like Waltz, refers to himself as a supporter
of "structural realism" (Mearsheimer 2001, 20). One of the basic tenets
of political realism (whether "human nature realism" or "structural
realism") is, first, that the [states are the]{.underline} main, if not
the **[only, relevant actors]{.underline}** in the context of
international relations; [and]{.underline} second, that states
**[compete for power]{.underline}** in the international arena. **[Moral
considerations]{.underline}** in international affairs, according to
realists, [are **secondary**]{.underline} [when set against the state's
primary goal]{.underline}, **[namely its own security and
survival]{.underline}**. But while human nature realists such as
Morgenthau explain the struggle for power as a result of human beings'
natural inclinations, structural realists like Waltz and Mearsheimer
argue that conflicts in the international arena do not stem from human
nature, but from the very "structure" of the international system of
states (Mearsheimer 2001, 18). According to Waltz and Mearsheimer, [it
is this **structure** that compels individuals to act as they do in the
domain of international affairs.]{.underline} And one distinguishing
feature of the international system of states is [its "anarchical
structure,"]{.underline} i.e. the lack of a central government analogous
to the central governments that exist in the context of domestic
politics. [It means that each individual state is responsible for its
own integrity and survival]{.underline}. [In the absence of a superior
authority]{.underline}, over and above the power of each sovereign
state, [political leaders]{.underline} often [feel compelled to favor
**security over morality**]{.underline}, even if, all other things being
considered, they would naturally be more inclined to trust and to
cooperate with political leaders of other states. On the other hand,
when political leaders do trust and cooperate with other states, it is
not necessarily their benevolent nature that motivates them to be
cooperative and trustworthy, but, again, it is the structure of the
system of states that compels them. The concept of human nature, as we
can see, does not play a decisive role here. Because Waltz and
Mearsheimer depart from "human nature realism," their version of
political realism has also sometimes been called "neo-realism" (Booth
1991, 533). Thus, **[even if]{.underline}** [human beings turn out to
become **morally enhanced**]{.underline} in the future, [humankind may
still have to face the same **scary scenarios**]{.underline} described
by some moral enhancement theorists. [This is likely to happen if,
indeed]{.underline}, [human beings remain compelled to
cooperate]{.underline} within the present structure of the system of
states. Consider, for instance, the incident with a Norwegian weather
rocket in January 1995. Russian radars detected a missile that was
initially suspected of being on its way to reach Moscow in five minutes.
All levels of Russian military defense were immediately put on alert for
a possible imminent attack and massive retaliation. It is reported that
for the first time in history a Russian president had before him, ready
to be used, the "nuclear briefcase" from which the permission to launch
nuclear weapons is issued. And that happened when the Cold War was
already supposed to be over! In the event, it was realized that the
rocket was leaving Russian territory and Boris Yeltsin did not have to
enter the history books as the man who started the third world war by
mistake (Cirincione 2008, 382).3 But [under the crushing pressure of
having to decide in such a short time, and on the basis of unreliable
information, whether or not to retaliate, even a morally enhanced
Yeltsin might have given orders to launch a devastating nuclear
response]{.underline} -- and that **[in spite of strong moral
dispositions to the contrary.]{.underline}** Writing for The Guardian on
the basis of recently declassified documents, Rupert Myers reports
further incidents similar to the one of 1995. He suggests that as more
states strive to acquire nuclear capability, the danger of a major
nuclear accident is likely to increase (Myers 2014). [What has to be
changed]{.underline}, therefore, [is not human moral
dispositions]{.underline}, **[but the very structure of the political
international system of states]{.underline}** within which we currently
live. As far as major threats to the survival of humankind are
concerned, moral enhancement might play an important role in the future
only to the extent that it will help humankind to change the structure
of the system of states. While [moral enhancement]{.underline} may
possibly have desirable results in some areas of human cooperation that
do not badly threaten our security -- such as donating food, medicine,
and money to poorer countries -- it [will not motivate political leaders
to **dismantle their nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. [Neither will it
deter other political leaders from pursuing nuclear
capability]{.underline}, [at any rate not as long as the structure of
international politics compels them to see prospective cooperators **in
the present as possible enemies in the future.**]{.underline} The idea
of a "structure" should not be understood here in metaphysical terms, as
though it mysteriously existed in a transcendent world and had the
magical power of determining leaders' decisions in this world. The word
"structure" denotes merely a political arrangement in which there are no
powerful law-enforcing institutions. And [in the absence of the kind of
security that law-enforcing institutions have the force to
create]{.underline}, [political leaders will]{.underline} often **[fail
to cooperate,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} occasionally [engage
in]{.underline} conflicts and [wars]{.underline}, [in those areas that
are critical to their]{.underline} security and [survival]{.underline}.
Given the structure of international politics and the basic goal of
survival, [this is likely to continue to happen]{.underline}, **[even
if,]{.underline}** in the future, political [leaders become **less
egoistic and power-seeking**]{.underline} through moral enhancement. On
the other hand, since the structure of the international system of
states is itself another human institution, there is no reason to
suppose that it cannot ever be changed. If people become morally
enhanced in the future they may possibly feel more strongly motivated to
change the structure of the system of states, or perhaps even feel
inclined to abolish it altogether. In my view, however, [addressing
major threats to the survival of humankind in the future by means of
**bioengineering**]{.underline} [is unlikely to yield the **expected
results**, so long as moral enhancement is pursued **within the present
framework of the international system of states.**]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Securitization Good

#### Military applications of AI are inevitable, so [de-securitizing]{.underline} isn't an [option]{.underline}. The risks are [real]{.underline} and pretending they [aren't]{.underline} risks undermining effective governance strategies.

[An Agenda For Ensuring **Security**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[Stability]{.underline}** in the Age of AI

[The starting point for dealing]{.underline} with the [international
**security implications**]{.underline} [of AI must be the
**acknowledgment**]{.underline} [that we are in it for the **long
haul**]{.underline}. There will be no quick fixes. [The]{.underline}
**[economic]{.underline}**, **[political]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[security drivers]{.underline}** [for mainstreaming
this]{.underline} **[suite of technologies]{.underline}**
[into]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}** functions
[are]{.underline} simply **[too powerful to be rolled
back]{.underline}**. [There will be plenty of **persuasive** national
**security applications**]{.underline}---[minimizing
casualties]{.underline} and [collateral damage]{.underline} through
[better discrimination of targets]{.underline}, [fighting]{.underline}
crime, defeating terrorist threats, saving on defense spending, and
protecting soldiers and their bases---to provide counterarguments
against concerns about runaway robots or accidental war caused by
machine error.

This acknowledgment must be accompanied by an intensification of
crossdomain literacy. AI cannot be the business of coders and cognitive
scientists alone; nor can its security implications be the province only
of diplomats, generals, and lawyers. Given the broad impact that AI
businesses can have on society, the business of AI has to be everyone's
business. Governance of AI can only be based on a correct understanding
of the power and limits of the technology, and such governance can only
be effective globally if it is part of a tiered approach that includes
actors at the intergovernmental, national, and industry levels.

Currently, [though]{.underline} military [investments in
**AI**]{.underline} [are]{.underline} being [acknowledged]{.underline},
[no state admits to the **existence**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
lethal autonomous **[weapon systems]{.underline}** in its inventory.
Thus, if [we want to **build** mutual **confidence** and]{.underline}
**[trust]{.underline}**, [we are left either to add
**discussions**]{.underline} on such systems [to]{.underline} existing
[dialogues on]{.underline} cyber**[security]{.underline}** and arms
control more broadly or to begin with new dialogues on approaches to
repurposable civilian capabilities. The latter might be a more
productive venue for engaging the private sector, which is wary of being
stigmatized by civil society as the maker or facilitator of "killer
robots." Tagging on discussions of AI to cybersecurity or traditional
arms control would also be unhelpful because of the risk of false
analogies.

Thus, [new]{.underline} innovatively structured
**[dialogues]{.underline}** in the track setting (involving both
government and nongovernmental parties) or the track setting
([involving]{.underline} artificial intelligence and **[international
security]{.underline}** only informal nongovernmental parties) [are
**required**]{.underline}. [The first objective should be to **enhance**
mutual]{.underline} **[understanding]{.underline}** [through in-depth
discussions on **national** approaches **to AI
development**]{.underline}, **[testing]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[validation]{.underline}**, [deployment, and use]{.underline}.
[Another objective should be to allow some **sharing** of **best
practices**]{.underline} or cautionary experiences. A third potential
objective would be to shift thinking from zerosum competitive approaches
to collaborative problem-solving using data and algorithmic insights
pooled by the participants themselves or put in escrow with a trusted
third party.

**[Agreement on norms]{.underline}** to govern the military use of AI
[could take time, but influencing the direction of such use by other
means]{.underline} **[brooks no delay]{.underline}**. One important
channel for shaping AI use globally is guiding principles short of
binding law. At a time [when there are **trust deficits** among
**nations** and]{.underline} **[multilateral negotiations]{.underline}**
[are at best seen as opportunities for "**lawfare**,"]{.underline} it
makes sense to rally around shared values and ethical principles. [In
the context of emerging technologies, such an approach also permits more
of an impact early on in the **innovation cycle**]{.underline}, when
national or international regulatory reach is absent or ambiguous.
Consistent with this logic, the EU High-Level Expert Group on Artificial
Intelligence has identified five principles---beneficence,
nonmaleficence, autonomy of humans, justice, and explicability---for the
trustworthy and ethical development of AI.

More specifically, [in]{.underline} the context of **[military
use]{.underline}**, [in the Group of Governmental Experts]{.underline}
of the Convention on Certain Conventional [Weapons on emerging
technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapon systems
(**LAWS**]{.underline}), [comprised of states and including all
**countries** thought]{.underline} to be **[pursuing national security
applications]{.underline}** of AI, identified ten guiding principles on
emerging technologies in the area of LAWS. These principles cover
aspects related to the applicability of international humanitarian law,
human responsibility, accountability, risk assessment and mitigation,
and the need to take a nonanthropomorphic view of such systems. The
guiding principles are accompanied by building blocks of common
understandings on definitions and the nature of human intervention
required throughout the various stages of technology development and
deployment to uphold compliance with international law, in particular
international humanitarian law.

Another channel for the soft governance of AI could be engineering
standards and codes. At a minimum, a common vocabulary for assessing
risks and aligning design with safety and reliability considerations is
needed. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' Global
Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems has started
building a shared, multidisciplinary, and evolving resource of terms.
There is further scope for constructing common standards that can
progressively align practices around the globe to responsible
principles.

Last Word

[There is a growing concern over the **repurposing of AI
technologies**]{.underline} for warfare. As with cyber weapons, [LAWS
could have indiscriminate effects]{.underline} and be turned around to
attack the attackers.They can create challenges for the application of
international humanitarian law principles, such as distinction,
proportionality, and precaution, all of which presuppose a degree of
human reflection and control. [Their international **security
implications** are still **unfolding** but could be as **significant as
the nuclear revolution**]{.underline} [in warfare]{.underline}, if not
more so. [Innovative and agile ways of **governing** the]{.underline}
use of **[AI]{.underline}** [are **needed urgently**]{.underline} [to
head off risks to **international peace**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[security]{.underline}**.

6\. The two faces of security -- and of peace [Security]{.underline},
especially [[state security]{.mark}, tends to be enacted in contexts of
the violently contested **political authority**]{.underline}.
[[Often]{.mark} it [is enacted through **violent
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rebranded as legitimate force. Small
wonder that some in the development community, including those who
drafted SDG 16, hesitate to use the word at all. [But [**although**
security is]{.mark} a **[deeply disputed]{.mark}** idea, [it is]{.mark}
also a **[highly]{.mark} [necessary]{.mark}** one]{.underline}.
[Security functions simultaneously as an analytical construct, as a
**frame for policy** and as a **moral narrative**]{.underline}. It is
distinct from the equally ambiguous if less contentious concept of
peace. Yet, at the same time, [it is]{.underline} often seen as
[**essential** [to the preservation of **peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Most of the things that international decision-makers, political and
security elites and development practitioners do in security's name are
supposed to protect the safety and welfare of people in a world of
multiple challenges and threats. However, [there is a tendency to slide
from **global**, to **national**, to **citizen** and to human security
and back again, without enough serious reflection on how they
**interconnect**]{.underline} and on where tensions and contradictions
lie hidden. Development agencies have too often plunged into security
policies and programmes, without a clear understanding of where they
might lead, who would benefit and how they might go wrong. The
ambiguities stem in part from a deep-seated tension between two distinct
visions of security (summarised in Table 3), which interconnect, yet are
in deep tension with eachother. [On the **one hand**]{.underline},
[[security]{.mark} can be seen as a process of political and social
ordering, aiming to reduce violence and keep the peace]{.underline}. As
such it is territorially organised and kept in place globally as well as
nationally through the authoritative discourses and practices of power,
including socially sanctioned violence. [[It connects to]{.mark}
conceptions of what Galtung termed '[negative peace']{.mark}: the
[ending]{.mark} of overt [violence, without]{.mark} necessarily
**[transforming]{.mark} the [conditions]{.mark}** giving rise to this
violence]{.underline} [or attending to the **quality** of the
**subsequent peace**]{.underline}. In this view security is a public
good delivered in principle by states, much like official or
donor-driven development.29 Yet in a world where states and indeed the
international order face sustained challenges, security is often kept in
place also through alternative nonstate or 'hybrid' networks of violence
and protection.30 Moreover, security is far from being an unalloyed
public good. In principle, it is equally shared and socially inclusive,
even if in practice it is anything but, especially at the insurgent
margins where insecurity is most acute. For [in practice [it
protects]{.mark} **socially [embedded power]{.mark}**, established
property relations and **social privilege** -- and reinforces global,
national and local **inequalities**]{.underline}. [[On the **other
hand**, security can be seen]{.underline}]{.mark} (in the vernacular)
[[as an **entitlement**]{.mark} **of citizens**]{.underline} and more
widely human beings [[to **social peace**]{.mark} and [**protection from
violence**,]{.mark} [abuses of **rights**]{.mark} and [**social
injustice**, along with]{.mark} other [**existential risks** such as
**famine** or **disease**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It connects to]{.mark}
the idea of '**[positive peace']{.mark}**, including **transformations**
in the social conditions giving rise to violence and [deepening]{.mark}
the **[relationships]{.mark} between states and** their
**citizens**]{.underline}. The vernacular understandings, day-to-day
experience, resilience and agency of the people and groups who are
'secured' and 'developed' are in this view the touchstone by which to
evaluate security and violence reduction[. Most [people **fall
back**]{.mark} up[on]{.mark} their **[social identities]{.mark}** -- as
women and men, members of families, clans, castes, [ethnic
groups]{.mark}, sects, religions and [nationalities]{.mark} -- [to
navigate]{.mark} their [social worlds]{.mark}, [to **respond to
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline} and violence and (sometimes) to
organise for violence. At the same time, [[these]{.mark} [**identities**
are **written into**]{.mark} the **[structures of]{.mark} power and
[inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [being [deployed to **establish
hierarchies of citizenship**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **patterns of
[exclusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ensuring that security is inclusive
and not simply the security of particular groups or the property of the
well-armed, powerful and wealthy, is fraught with difficulty and must be
negotiated at multiple levels. 'Security in the vernacular' is the term
used here rather than the interlinked but distinct concepts of 'human
security' and of 'citizen security' popularised by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank,31 which fit in the
conceptual toolboxes of development practitioners, humanitarian agencies
and intervention forces. Both human and citizen security have come under
criticism for 'securitising' development by framing poverty, exclusion
and vulnerability through security lenses, and thus paving the way for
military interventions in the affairs of fragile states.32 '[**[Security
in the vernacular]{.mark}'** paves the way for more precise and detailed
empirical scrutiny of how security and plays out in particular local and
national contexts. It highlights the experience and social agency of
those who are 'secured'. And it [underscores]{.mark} the [transformative
potential]{.mark} of security as an **entitlement**]{.underline}, [which
can be **actively claimed** by those who **challenge** the **deeply
rooted legacies** of **insecurity**, **exclusion** and
**injustice**]{.underline}. Both these faces of security have their
underside, most obviously the first. 'Seeing like a state' even with the
best of intentions can lead to the interests of citizens being
sacrificed to an unbending vision of national security or of top-down
development (as even in Nyerere's Tanzania).33 It is also open to abuse
-- for instance, to prop up authoritarian regimes; to advance the
interests of predatory elites; to impose exclusionary economic and
social policies; to justify state secrecy and surveillance of citizens;
or to justify the hegemonies and military adventurism of major world
powers. And it tends to be closely if complexly related to 'seeing like
a corporation', most obviously in enclave economies, where privatised
security arrangements in protected enclaves may indeed destabilise or
weaken the state.34 The [**deformations** of **security in the
vernacular** tend to be more hidden]{.underline}, but no less damaging
-- for instance, [the submission of minorities and refugees to campaigns
of exclusion and violence by populist majorities]{.underline}; [forms of
**popular justice** that **violate the rights**]{.underline}, dignity
and safety of supposed perpetrators; or grass roots endorsement of
'traditional' or customary institutions, which perpetuate gender and
other inequities. Moreover, local-level insecurities can persist or even
worsen, when a state, like India or Brazil, is considered to be stable,
or a region or locality is considered to be secure. Neither face of
security can be considered without the other. The relationship between
them is utterly crucial. The capacity of states to protect their
citizens is at the basis of the social contract.35 That is, [the rights
and security of citizens]{.underline} and people [are the bedrock of
state and international security -- or at least they **should
be**]{.underline}. But [these entitlements cannot be protected without
some kind of **social order**]{.underline}, however achieved. [And how
and by whom social order is assured are both **affairs of governance**
and **vital concerns** for **everyone** who lives under the **leaky
umbrella** of **political authority**]{.underline}. **[[Political
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[durable
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the]{.underline} [**[rule of
law]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[effective and
[accountable security apparatuses]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[are]{.underline}**]{.mark} not just **[[desirable]{.mark} attributes
of states]{.underline}** but are also in many respects conditions of the
security of people. However, [[they]{.mark} **[come at a
price]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not just in taxes, but also [[because of
the need for **constant vigilance**]{.mark} to ensure that those charged
with delivering security do not ignore or still worse violate the
entitlements of those they are supposed to protect]{.underline}.

Affect the Risk of Nuclear War?" RAND Corporation, 2018,

Overall workshop participants agreed that [**AI has significant
potential to upset the foundations of nuclear stability and undermine
deterrence by the year 2040,** especially in the increasingly multipolar
strategic environment.]{.underline} [Dismissing the Hollywood nightmare
of malevolent AIs trying to destroy humanity with nuclear weapons,
experts were instead concerned with more-mundane issues arising from
improving capabilities.]{.underline} AI applications discussed included
the ability to track and target adversary launchers for counterforce
targeting and the incorporation of AI into decision support systems
informing choices about the use of nuclear weapons.

[Some experts fear that an increased reliance on AI could lead to new
types of **catastrophic mistakes.** There may be pressure to use it
**before it is technologically mature**; it may be **susceptible** to
**adversarial subversion**; or adversaries may believe that the AI is
more capable than it is, leading them to make **catastrophic
mistakes**.]{.underline}

On the other hand, [if the nuclear powers manage to **establish a form
of strategic stability** compatible with the emerging capabilities that
AI might provide, the machines could **reduce distrust** and **alleviate
international tensions**, thereby **decreasing the risk of nuclear
war.**]{.underline}

[At present, we cannot predict which---if any---of these scenarios will
come to pass,]{.underline} but [**we need to begin considering the
potential impact of AI on nuclear security before these challenges
become acute**.]{.underline} [Maintaining strategic stability in the
coming decades may prove extremely difficult]{.underline}, and all
nuclear powers will have to participate in the cultivation of
institutions to help limit nuclear risk. This goal will demand a
fortuitous combination of technological, military, and diplomatic
measures that will require rival states to cooperate. We hope that this
Perspective will begin that discussion and open a path toward pragmatism
and realism on these controversial and often polarizing topics.

### 2AC\-\--Securitization Inev

#### AI representations by foreign actors mean securitization is inevitable

**Zeng 21** - Professor of China and International Studies in the
Department of Politics, Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster University

Jinghan Zeng, "Securitization of Artificial Intelligence in China", The
Chinese Journal of International Politics, Volume 14, Issue 3, Pages
417--445, Autumn 2021,
<https://doi-org.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/10.1093/cjip/poab005>

Geopolitically speaking, [**China's national approach towards AI and
moves to make it a security matter are fuelled by ever more competitive
United States--China relations. Each side's perception of the other's AI
advancement as a threat accelerates the securitization process.** In the
domestic arena, where the primary concern is the regime security of the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP),]{.underline} **[the practical use of AI
and its relevant discourses are geared to securing authoritarian
rule]{.underline}**. In this regard[, China's bold AI experiments
practice a unique digital technocracy, making its AI approach quite
distinct from that in Western societies.]{.underline}

Currently, [this securitization is an ongoing process]{.underline}.
Although [**the extent of its impact on targeted audiences**, namely,
local governments, market actors, intellectuals, and the general
public**, remains unclear, all nevertheless enthusiastically echo the
central government's AI campaign**]{.underline}. In this regard, [such
securitization appears to convince domestic actors]{.underline}.
However**[, it also generates unintended consequences]{.underline}**.
They are: (i) **[creation of a nationalistic environment that makes
China less attractive to global AI labor and capital]{.underline}**;
(ii) **[impaired industrial efficiency by virtue of focusing on
self-reliance]{.underline}**; (iii) **[obstruction of China's global AI
governance leadership]{.underline}**; (iv) **[reinforced technological
rivalry due to disregard for potential global AI
cooperation]{.underline}**; and (v) **[constraints on the global access
of Chinese AI companies]{.underline}**. [All could undermine China's key
objectives of fostering a booming AI economy and becoming a global AI
leader.]{.underline}

Indeed, [**securitization of AI has progressively become a global
movement**. In the United States and Europe, for example, **the AI
advancements of geopolitical competitors, especially Russia and China,
are often perceived as a potential threat to national and international
security**]{.underline}. [The relevant speech act frames AI not as a
normal technology, but as a national security matter that **justifies
the enablement of extraordinary actions from the state and
society**.]{.underline} In effect, [it signifies the urgent need to
deploy more resources and support, for example, in the US case, not only
to the American AI-enabled military sector, but also the AI commercial
industry.]{.underline}

This article focuses on how AI is securitized within China. [Needless to
say, **the securitization process works differently in the Chinese
context, given its unique state-society relations**]{.underline}.
[Despite a non-liberal democratic setting, however**, there is still a
need to convince the domestic audience and thus win more support for
China's national AI plan**]{.underline}. Table 1 categorizes the
arguments into the securitization framework. It argues that [the Chinese
central government, as the securitizing actor, is performing a
securitizing move by labeling China's AI advancement as a matter of
security.]{.underline} In the relevant discourses, the national
interests and survival of the Chinese nation constitute the referent
object that needs to be protected[. As part of the central government's
AI campaign to mobilize domestic actors, this performative act aims to
convince the domestic audience including local, subnational, academic
actors, market actors,]{.underline} and the mass, as the rest of the
article will explore.

[The relevant securitizing move belongs to the type of securitization
referring to a directive elementary speech whose aim is to raise an item
on the agenda]{.underline}.36 **[It consists of "three sequential,
elementary speech acts," including claim, warn, and
request.]{.underline}**37 In this case, [the State Council of China aims
to raise its audience's awareness of AI's importance, and requests the
relevant actions]{.underline}. As the quote at the beginning of the
article claims and warns, **[other countries (i.e. China's competitors)
are elevating AI as a significant national strategy for the sake of
national security.]{.underline}**

The document also claims that, **[as China lacks significant original AI
innovations, China's overall AI development lags behind that of other
great powers]{.underline}**.38 As such, **[it requests the nation's
prioritization of AI advancement to protect national
security]{.underline}**. [On the heels of this request comes the setting
of the broad goal to make China a leading AI power, along with a
three-step plan and a targeted timeline to]{.underline}: (i) **[catch up
with the AI technological progress of world-leading countries such as
the United States by 2020]{.underline}**; (ii) **[make major
breakthroughs in certain AI technologies by 2025]{.underline}**; and
(iii) **[become a global leading AI power by 2030]{.underline}**.39 In
short, **[the Chinese central government is labeling AI as a national
security matter and highlighting the threat of falling behind in efforts
to convince domestic actors to support its action plan.]{.underline}**

[The serious damage American sanctions have inflicted on Chinese tech
companies **has heightened China's awareness of both its technological
weakness and feelings of insecurity in regard to global
reliance**]{.underline}. Understandably, therefore, **[China wants to
master leading AI technology independently]{.underline}**. As Xi Jinping
elaborates:

[accelerating the development of a new generation of AI is an important
strategic handhold for China to gain the initiative in global science
and technology competition...**We need to ensure that the core AI
technologies are firmly in our own hands.**]{.underline}62

[China's AI aspirations extend to global leadership]{.underline}. Since
China's rise, the US-led global order has left China dissatisfied due to
the limits it places on China's say in global norms and rules.63 Rather
than a norm-taker, China now aspires to be a norm-shaper, or even a
norm-maker. Many Chinese scholars argue that current established norms
are geared primarily to serving interests other than those of China.64
[To maximize Chinese interests, therefore, future norms should be
defined by/for China, and on Chinese terms.]{.underline}

In addition to history and geopolitics**[, China's securitizing move
also has a domestic context]{.underline}**. Certain [scholars see AI as
exerting two types of impact on China's national security---traditional
and non-traditional]{.underline}.80 [**The former refers to the military
threat**, namely the aforementioned use of AI in warfare; **the latter
includes such non-military sources as political security, economic
security, environmental security, cyber security, and energy
security**]{.underline}.81 However**[, most important is the so-called
political security (政治安全) or institutional security (制度安全),
i.e., regime security.]{.underline}**

As far as regime security is concerned, [the bold and controversial AI
practices China applies to state governance is an inevitable
topic]{.underline}. As part of the CCP's adaptation strategy in the
digital age, **[China has invested heavily in AI technologies in order
to advance towards digital governance]{.underline}**. Such **[AI
investment expects returns in the form of improved public services (by
enhancing efficiency), and maintenance of authoritarian
rule.]{.underline}**82 [AI's empowerment of digital surveillance is
widely discussed among international analysts, having been used to
upgrade China's sophisticated state surveillance program and potentially
reshape state-society relations]{.underline}.83 Although
similar---though less intensive and extensive---[AI surveillance
programs have been implemented worldwide, due to privacy concerns they
have met with considerable social resistance in Western societies in
efforts to balance states' use of AI]{.underline}.84 **[In China,
however, there is scant legal constraint on the relevant AI
practices]{.underline}**. For example, [China has pioneered AI facial
recognition technology, which has been restricted, or even banned in
many Western societie]{.underline}s. Meanwhile, to reduce social
resistance[, **the Chinese government has proactively guided public
opinion on AI by framing it as positive and modern social progress that
is of enormous benefit in securing public safety,**]{.underline} as will
be discussed later.

**[Certain Chinese scholars also link AI with economic
security.]{.underline}** Li Zheng from the China Institutes of
Contemporary International Relations, for example, holds that
[sustaining the current socialist market economy with Chinese
characteristics is the core of China's economic security]{.underline}.85
In essence**[, this economic security extends to regime security, i.e.,
securing the CCP's rule]{.underline}**. In spite of its quasi-capitalist
market reforms, [the CCP's economic policies have always been
constrained by its ideological commitment to being a communist
entity]{.underline}.86 Thus, in the interests of its political
legitimacy, [the CCP must uphold certain socialist
responsibilities]{.underline}. Li argues that **[AI will be able not
only to improve socioeconomic governance, including market supervision,
and fight economic crime, but also strengthen the CCP's capability to
manage the macro and microeconomy]{.underline}**.87

convince local states, market actors, intellectuals, and the general
public]{.underline}**. But if AI is indeed being securitized, so what[?
Although it is difficult to quantify the exact impact of this
securitizing move, it undoubtedly helps the Chinese central government's
mobilization of domestic actors towards advancing its AI
agenda]{.underline}. Nevertheless, this move also generates unintended
consequences for the securitizing actor's goal in the long run.
According to the State Council's AI plans, its three-step AI plan
carries the specific goals of fostering a booming AI economy, and a
grand goal of becoming a global AI leader.125 Securitization may
undermine these key objectives for several reasons.

First, a highly securitized AI sector will affect the flow of foreign AI
labor and capital to China's AI industry. To make it attractive to
global talent and capital, a booming AI industry requires an
outward-looking, open-minded, and international socio-politico-economic
environment. However, the securitization trend is pushing in the
opposite direction by producing a rising nationalistic, inward-looking,
security AI discourse. This is counterproductive to China's AI
ambitions, because it puts China at a disadvantage in the global market.
More specifically, there is a global shortage of AI talent and, as
previously mentioned, China is short of 5 million or more qualified AI
industry workers. This has led to fierce global competition in the AI
industry for qualified workers, to the extent where Chinese tech
companies offer extremely---or unreasonably---high salaries.126 Such
financial attraction, however, could be offset by an unfavorably
nationalistic domestic environment.

Second, the securitization trend could hinder economic efficiency. As
previously discussed, it contributes to the rise of a self-reliance
discourse on technology whose creation is often at the cost of economic
efficiency. Precisely because China is lagging behind in AI development,
it needs to make use of the global AI supply chain to catch up. However,
the self-reliance discourse considers the risk of relying on foreign
technology too high, and thus focuses on "Made in China." Such
self-reliance is difficult (if not impossible) to realize in the short
run, and hinders China's ability to benefit from the global AI market
and thus maximize industrial efficiency. Similarly, the securitization
of AI in the United States also undermines the appeal that America holds
for Chinese national AI talent, capital, and technology. Growing tension
between China and the United States has, moreover, undermined Chinese
companies' willingness to invest in the United States. In the long run,
therefore, securitization is detrimental to the competitiveness of the
American AI industry.

Third, in connection with the above paragraph, the domestic
inward-looking nationalistic trend that securitization has created
hinders China's realization of global leadership. To lead AI in the
global arena, China must provide public goods and win support from
others through successful partnerships. It must play a key role in
promoting global governance and, as a global leader, act according to
common interests rather than solely national interests. However, a
security-focused, inward-looking, nationalistic AI discourse is helpful
to neither global governance nor common interests. For example, it can
foster the rise of inward-looking national AI policies that prioritize
national interests over those of the globalized world. This is in direct
contrast to global governance goals, i.e., to build a shared future
through global solidarity. Indeed, many of the problems that AI has
created, such as those relating to ethics, represent collective
challenges to humankind that require a globally concerted response.
Inward-looking national AI policies may contribute to a fragmented
global governance structure, and thus obstruct concerted global actions
to address AI problems.

Fourth**[, the securitization trend has reinforced technological rivalry
at the expense of the potential for global AI cooperation, and will
likely exacerbate the United States--China confrontation]{.underline}**.
[This is not to deny the existence of United States--China cooperation
in the field of AI]{.underline}. [However, **by speaking of AI in the
language of security and a global race, the relevant security AI
discourse emphasizes competition over cooperation and destruction over
creation.**]{.underline} [This may produce a real security threat, and
perhaps an actual global AI race, thus undermining the space for
cooperation from which both the United States and China can
benefit.]{.underline} In other words**[, the rivalry discourse adopts a
zero-sum geopolitical angle for understanding AI innovation that is
inevitably to the latter's detriment in both
countries.]{.underline}**127

More importantly, **[securitization may push AI further into the hard
security area by virtue of its military applications]{.underline}**.
[The securitizing actor tends to exaggerate the security threat to
achieve a successful securitization, so enhancing the strategic risks of
AI military practices and increasing the likelihood of war, and of
escalating ongoing conflicts]{.underline}. [**In this regard, a highly
securitized AI politics may set China and the United States on a
dangerous path towards a catastrophic confrontation that imperils
everyone's interests and security**. In the worst case scenario, as in
all arms races, **blithe assertions about the inevitability of
AI-enabled war are a self-fulfilling and self-defeating
prophecy.**]{.underline} In this regard, the aforementioned Fu Ying's
call to regulate AI's military application merits more attention.

Lastly, by strengthening state involvement in China's AI industry,
**[securitization may undermine the interests of Chinese AI
companies]{.underline}**. [The boundary between the state and the market
is always far less defined in China than in other countries, due to
China's political environment]{.underline}. [**Making AI a national
security matter justifies the necessity for heavier state involvement,
if not control**.]{.underline} Although a blessing in the Chinese
domestic market, **[close ties with the state are a burden on the global
stage]{.underline}**. [Take the aforementioned civil-military
integration]{.underline} as an example. [Although helpful in gaining
China's AI companies and research institutes more state funding, it
undermines their global access]{.underline}. **[Close relations with the
Chinese government have caused certain Chinese AI companies, including
members of the "national AI team of China," to be subjected to
punishment, in the form of the aforementioned American
sanctions]{.underline}**. In this regard, **[securitization could hinder
the access of China's AI companies to the global market, and hence their
future development]{.underline}**. [It also remains to be seen whether
heavier state involvement in the AI industry hinders market
efficiency.]{.underline}

How AI Could Enhance Chinese Capability

[The most likely sources of a potential U.S.-Chinese
conflict]{.underline}, [such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or a
contest over some South China Sea feature]{.underline}, [would likely
feature the full spectrum of]{.underline} civil and military information
[operations aimed at deterring U.S. intervention and degrading U.S.
allies']{.underline} will to fight. AI could play a dominant role in
each of these missions. The Network Systems Department of [the People's
Liberation Army]{.underline}, for example, [may try using generative
language models to synthesize and amplify content on Facebook and
Instagram]{.underline}, [as it has done]{.underline} using botnets and
other non-AI tools [around Taiwanese elections]{.underline}. [The
Chinese military is]{.underline} also [likely to wage a similar campaign
to discredit U.S. military activities or sow division with partners,
including Australia and Japan]{.underline}.

Soon after the start of a conflict, [the People's Liberation Army would
likely attack U.S. sensor and communication networks]{.underline}, and
several different kinds of machine-learning applications could aid this
task. A cadre of [scientists at the People's Liberation Army National
University of Defense Technology]{.underline}, for example, [specializes
in "fuzzing,"]{.underline} [using machine learning to identify
vulnerabilities in an adversary's computer networks.]{.underline}
Experts also point to AI's role in attacking or defending critical
infrastructure in Taiwan, Japan, Australia, or the United States.

[Chinese planners]{.underline} also [aim to use AI for electronic
countermeasures and operations across the electromagnetic
spectrum]{.underline}. For example, analysts from anquan neican (a
Chinese journal for cybersecurity research) are optimistic about
[cognitive electronic warfare]{.underline} --- [using AI to analyze
incoming radar signals]{.underline}, and then [automatically adapting
one's own output to optimize jamming]{.underline}. But several other
applications of AI also play a role in electronic spectrum operations.
[In 2020]{.underline}, for example, [the People's Liberation Army
awarded equipment contracts for swarms of drones equipped with modular
radar-jamming systems]{.underline}, [which could be flown near U.S.
carrier strike groups]{.underline}, military [installations in Japan and
South Korea]{.underline}, or shared [facilities in the
Philippines]{.underline}. [Many systems under development]{.underline}
by Chinese universities and military research institutions [are
explicitly designed to counter U.S. drone systems and swarm
concepts]{.underline}. [Chinese companies have]{.underline} already
exported [drones to Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, and
Egypt]{.underline}, among others. However, while some People's
Liberation Army experts contend that these drones have been "battle
tested," others are less sanguine about their capabilities in a real
conflict.

Moreover, [the People's Liberation Army may]{.underline} attempt to [use
AI to enhance the lethality and reach of]{.underline} its [surface ships
and anti-access and area denial systems]{.underline}, [which could hold
U.S. forces at risk during a crisis]{.underline}. China's current
approach to territorial defense relies on hundreds of short- to
long-range ballistic missiles that would target U.S. aircraft carriers
and strike aircraft based in mainland Japan, Okinawa, South Korea, and
as far away as Guam. [As early as 2016]{.underline}, [Wang
Changqing]{.underline}, [director of the General Design Department of
the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation]{.underline},
[claimed that the company's next generation of cruise missiles would use
AI to adapt to specific combat conditions]{.underline}, being [capable
of adjusting flight profiles and even warhead yield]{.underline}.
Chinese defense industry engineers appear inspired by the U.S.
Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, which uses AI to improve accuracy and
achieve more flexible targeting.

Finally, t[he People's Liberation Army is building a wide array of
autonomous vehicles and extensive undersea sensor networks that make use
of AI and big-data analytics.]{.underline} [These systems may be useful
in recording and transmitting the locations of U.S. undersea
vehicles]{.underline}, and would be crucial to [overcoming the Chinese
military's disadvantages in undersea warfare]{.underline}. [Large
unmanned submarines]{.underline}, such as the HSU-001 and Haishen-6000,
[could be equipped with sea mines to deny the U.S. Navy access to
undersea space between the first and second island chains]{.underline},
[or to restrict access to the Taiwan or Luzon Straits.]{.underline}

Of course, [AI has the potential to revolutionize Chinese
operations]{.underline} in countless other ways, including [through
predictive maintenance, logistics, and back-office tasks]{.underline}
not discussed in depth in this article. In any case, it is clear that
[the People's Liberation Army is banking on the technology to create
asymmetric advantages vis-a-vis the United States.]{.underline}

A second approach focuses on why cyber norms emerge only slowly,
building on the existing IR norms literature (Finnemore & Hollis, 2016).
Early works in this area focused on the debate among states, especially
at the United Nations, followed by a growing number of proposal from the
private and the civil sector (Hurwitz, 2014). However, cyber norms
remain contested at the international level (Grisby, 2017). More
recently, the interest of researchers shifted to the role of the
creators (mostly private entities) and exploiters (sub-, semi-, and
non-state actors) of digital technologies in shaping the behavioral
standards that new regulation needs to take into account (Hurel &
Lobato, 2018). **[States]{.underline}** [need to know how their
**intelligence services**]{.underline} [work in cyberspace, because
through their **tools** and **practices**]{.underline} [they set
practical norms of acceptable (**cyber) espionage**]{.underline} with
[far-reaching effects on **state behavior** in]{.underline}
**[cyberspace]{.underline}** (Georgieva, 2019). [The focus on the role
of **intelligence** agencies in cyber conflict]{.underline}--as [both
the biggest threat and the most **capable provider** of]{.underline}
**[safety]{.underline}**--[opens up interesting questions linked to the
**larger transformation**]{.underline} [of these agencies in the context
of the **digitization of society**]{.underline}. [Some authors argue
that cyber conflict is primarily an **intelligence game**]{.underline},
because setting up cyber exploitation is much more expensive than
countering released exploitation, which increases the incentive to keep
the target at risk (Lindsay, 2017).

A third approach explores the broader repercussion of cyber conflict
dynamics for government and governance. The concept of networked
governance seems especially apt at capturing the essence of cyberspace
as co-constituted by technical devices and networks and socio-political
institutions (Hofmann, 2016). The key governance challenge in cyberspace
is fragmentation of authority and accountability. A case in point is the
lack in public transparency and trusted knowledge about the perpetrators
behind most cyber incidents. Although the number of public attributions
of cyber incidents by states and threat intelligence firms has been on
the rise, both types of actors have political and economic reasons not
to fully disclose their evidence (Egloff, 2019). As a consequence,
attribution claims remain contested in the public domain, undermining
the legitimacy of state action--from insurance matters and criminal
proceedings to mechanism of international cooperation and potentially
escalation control.

Cluster 3: Securitization, practice, and assemblages

Looking back at the beginnings of the cyber threat story, the policy
debate was riddled with cyber-doom scenarios and constant attempts to
mobilize in the political process. As a reaction to what was considered
a "hype," some scholars started to get interested in why and how this
issue was presented the way it was and with what consequences. Early
work to analyze the issues surrounding the politics of Internet from IR
and critical security studies perspectives emerged at the end of the
1990s (Deibert, 2002; Eriksson, 2001; Saco, 1999). A bit later, there
was a concentrated effort to apply variations of securitization theory
to the issue of cyber security politics (cf. Dunn Cavelty, 2008; Hansen
& Nissenbaum, 2009; Lawson, 2013). Securitization signifies the
representation of a fact, a person, or a development as a danger for the
military, political, economic, ecological, and/or social security of a
political collective and the acceptance of this representation by the
respective political addressee (Buzan, Waever, & De Wilde, 1998). The
successful securitization of a topic justifies the use of all available
means to counter it--including those outside the normal political rules
of the game.

Following the theory, the prime questions this literature engaged with
were related to the object of security, to what or whom was considered
the main threat, and to what policy responses flowed from these threat
constructions (Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010). Given its theoretical
underpinnings, the Copenhagen School focuses mainly on official
statements by heads of state, high-ranking officials or heads of
international institutions (Hansen, 2006, p. 64). What a focus on elite
speech acts ignores, however, is how these discursive practices are
facilitated or prepared by practices of actors that are not so easily
visible. The social competition for the definition of reality is not
only held in the open political arena. There are always state and
nonstate actors "under the radar"--that is, specialized bureaucratic
units, consultants or other experts--which have the capacity to
establish "the truth" about certain threats, thus pre-structuring the
discursive field in relevant ways (Huysmans, 2006, p. 72).

Cyber security, so the common assumption, arises from the interaction of
technologies, processes, and everyday practices. Thus, the literature
pays particular attention to how a variety of actors uses different
representations of danger to create or change different political,
private, social, and commercial understandings of security in selected
public spheres. In addition, it gives more weight to material aspects of
the issue in the tradition of STS (Balzacq & Dunn Cavelty, 2016;
Collier, 2018; Shires, 2018; Stevens, 2016), looking at the
co-constitution of technology and politics. In particular, it recognizes
that the political reading of cyber security cannot be divorced from
particular knowledge practices in different communities.

As the most recent research focus to emerge, literature in this cluster
covers a variety of topics, united by a focus on understanding how cyber
security emerges as an assemblage of people, objects, and enacted ideas.
Questions of authority and power are most directly addressed by research
in this cluster. C. Stevens (2019) sets out to better understand the
role of cyber security companies by looking at Symantec's analysis of
Stuxnet and the publication of their reports in the public. Tanczer
(2019) focuses on the increasingly blurred boundaries between field of
security professionals and hackers, pointing to changes in the larger
context of security and insecurity that are reflected in the practices
of these technical experts and in the conception of them. Shires (2019)
looks at how the cyber security industry portrays cyberspace as a
terrain of persistent threat, systemic vulnerability, and intelligence
ambiguity, a classic "noir" narrative that results from systemic
economic deficiencies (distorted incentives for protection) and from
systemic political deficiencies (black markets for new exploits). By
focusing on non-traditional actors and aspects of politics, this type of
research is able to make invisible aspects of cyber security visible.

Conclusion: [Where is **cyber security**]{.underline}
[politics]{.underline} research [headed]{.underline}?

[Over the past decade, **research** in **cyber security**]{.underline}
[politics has seen the emergence of a **growing**
interdisciplinary]{.underline} **[body]{.underline}** [of work that is
at the same time **theoretically informed**]{.underline}, [grounded in
**empirical observations**, and **policy-relevant** in many of its
insights. We have ended our **intellectual history** by outlining three
research clusters. In place]{.underline} of a summary of the past and
present evolution of cyber security as a security political issue, we
want to look into a possible future of research on cyber security
politics in this concluding section. We do this based on the same
assumption discussed at the beginning of this article: that the
trajectory of both cyber security research and cyber security policy
will continue to be shaped by the interplay between technology,
politics, and science. The direction in which research and policy will
move will be co-constituted by technological possibilities, political
choices, and scientific practices. We end our intellectual history with
a brief outlook on likely developments in all three areas.

Digital technologies have politics, and technological possibilities and
developments will require new governance mechanisms, while at the same
time being shaped by politics. First, the interconnectedness between
ever more complex socio-technical systems is bound to increase. Cyber
security will grow in importance as a topic as countries all around the
world strive to shape digital transformation processes that affect
society, economy, and the state alike. In the context of what has been
called fourth industrial revolution, the complexity of socio-technical
systems will increase due the ubiquitous digitalization and automation
of technical processes that support a great variety of socio-political
institutions. As these technical system become tighter coupled and
integrate more aspects of society and economy, cyber security concerns
will inevitably expand to more policy fields at both the national and
international level. These developments will create new demands for
technical and organizational research that needs to be better integrated
with approaches from the social and political science.

Second, cyberspace will become increasingly dependent on space-based
technologies and interlinked with newly emerging technologies in the
fields of quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). This will
increase the size of cyberspace. More importantly, as an enabling
technology with diverse applications in all areas of life, AI will link
cyberspace to more policy fields. AI will become an essential element of
cyber security and will have a profound impact on the speed, scale,
duration, autonomy, and complexity of cyber operations, for both offense
and defense. These new technologies will be primarily developed by
global technology firms and the private sector. As a consequence, state
actors will likely become more dependent on technology firms and
independent technology experts, further transforming the relationship
between public and private actors. The fact that there is considerable
**[uncertainty]{.underline}** regarding the tempo and scope of these
technological [developments creates new demands for
**research**]{.underline} [that maps, assesses, models, and]{.underline}
**[forecasts]{.underline}** [new **technological
possibilities**]{.underline}. [As social scientists, we need to
understand the increasingly salient **political** and]{.underline}
social **[aspects]{.underline}** [that will affect the patterns of
**cooperation**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[conflict]{.underline}** in politics and society at the national and
international level.

**[Political choices]{.underline}** [at the **national**]{.underline}
and international **[level]{.underline}** [have a **technological
dimension**. Politics will **influence** and **govern
technology**]{.underline} [development while at the same time being
**pre-structured** by **technology**]{.underline}. [First, we can expect
that **political**]{.underline} and military **[actors]{.underline}**
[will attempt to better understand the (limited) **strategic
utility**]{.underline} [of cyber operations below the level of **armed
conflict**]{.underline}, [in order to find the right balance between
**restraint** and **exploitation**]{.underline}. [One key challenge in
this context is ho**w best** to **manage** the]{.underline}
**[transformation]{.underline}** of [state intelligence services in the
digital age and their **growing dependence**]{.underline} on private
intelligence firms. Another key challenge is linked to information
operations and propaganda that might be spread more targeted and
effectively via AI technologies and social media platforms. These
political developments raise important research questions that require
interdisciplinary answers.

Second, public actors will uphold their efforts to control the risk of
escalation trough international cooperation. [States cannot secure
cyberspace on their own, without taking into account **market** and
**social forces**; yet no]{.underline} **[stable cyber
governance]{.underline}** [framework will emerge without greater
**convergence** on **responsible behavior**]{.underline} [among **great
powers**]{.underline}. [As long as great powers
**disagree**]{.underline} [about what represents responsible use of
**cyber operations** in]{.underline} **[state
interactions]{.underline}**, and [for that matter what forms of
espionage and interference in the political process of other states
through cyberspace are acceptable, **little** top-down
**progress**]{.underline} [will materialize]{.underline}. **[Bottom-up
progress]{.underline}**, [on the other hand, presupposes that the actors
become **more visible**]{.underline} [for each other in order to
**successfully work together**]{.underline} [in a multi-stakeholder
framework]{.underline}. **[Research]{.underline}** [can shed light on
**invisible actors** and **analyze**]{.underline} [the interaction
between market]{.underline} **[dynamics]{.underline}** [and **political
dynamics**]{.underline} in stabilizing cyberspace, it can evaluate if
the socio-technical institutions that secure cyberspace reflect the
tools and practices of public and private actors.

Third, the key governance challenge at the domestic political level is
how to overcome fragmentation of authority and accountability. Tighter
coupling of technical systems and their growing interconnectedness with
socio-political institutions creates growing demand for governance in
networks, which in turn means that governments increasingly share
responsibility with actors from business and society. The integration of
policy into a coherent overall framework involves difficult trade-offs
between security and privacy and creates horizontal and vertical
coordination and cooperation problems across government and at the
intersections between state, economy, and society. Research can evaluate
how states can fine-tune their multidimensional roles. How states decide
to regulate their technology base is moreover directly linked to how
they anticipate this will influence their relative economic, political,
and military power at the international level. Academics in this context
can study how different (democratic and authoritarian) political systems
balance regulation and market forces differently and what this means for
state access to the private technology sector, export control systems of
dual-use technologies, and screening mechanisms of foreign investment
into the strategically relevant technology base.

Scientific practice, as our third and final sphere of interest, will
keep coevolving with the anticipated changes in the spheres of
technology and politics. We started the article with the ascertainment
that there is no "field" or "subfield" of cyber security politics--and
we conclude with a wish that this remains true in the future. [Research
at the **intersection**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
**[cybersecurity]{.underline}** [and **security politics** in order to
remain **relevant**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[policy
choices]{.underline}** [and cognizant of technological possibilities
needs to **speak to** a variety]{.underline} of **[other bodies of
research]{.underline}**, [free to choose interesting and pressing issue
without **disciplinary constraints**; it needs to co-opt some of the
**new data** analytical tools]{.underline} **[offered by
AI]{.underline}**, [and it needs to flexibly overcome some of the
**institutional barriers**]{.underline} [that slowed down its
**independent contribution** to **cyber security**]{.underline}.

A first key challenge for cyber security politics research is conceptual
and linked to the integration of theoretical knowledge from different
disciplines and research traditions. Researchers need to better
integrate concepts and mechanisms from IR and security studies, IPE, and
intelligence studies to analyze the transformation of intelligence
services and how this affects their relationship with private cyber
security and intelligence firms. They need to better understand the
interplay between (black) security markets and (covert) security
political dynamics if they want to explain the co-existence of strategic
restraint and low-level subversion in cyberspace. Cyber security
politics research must pay more attention to economic aspects of the
phenomena at hand. Practice theory with its focus on technological
possibilities and socio-technical processes allows to integrate these
different approaches at the empirical level. STS offers a productive
lens for understanding the mutual interplay between the technical and
the socio-political sphere and, from an analytical point of view, to
deal with the opaqueness of cyber operations. Such an approach is of
critical importance in an attempt to shed light on how the cyber
security policy and practice of states, both at the national and the
international level, are facilitated or thwarted by the interests and
practices of actors that are not easily visible, in- and outside of
governments.

A second key challenge or indeed an opportunity for cyber security
politics research is linked to the fact that more data about cyber
operations by many different actors around the world and better tools to
monitor and analyze this data are becoming available. While there is
room for theory development and theory testing, we will likely enter an
era of empirical work. In-depth qualitative studies on the role of
invisible actors in state interactions linked to cyber security can be
combined with more data-driven approaches that evaluate how new AI tools
affect the cyber offense-defense balance. As state actors begin to
integrate these tools in their border guards, police corps, armies and
disaster response structures, important social and political questions
will arise linked to privacy, bias, and control. Conversely, governments
and societies will need to discuss how much of this new data should be
made publicly available and what this means for data protection and
privacy. From a research point of view, these developments call for more
interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer science,
mathematics, economics, and political science.

A third key challenge for cyber security politics research is linked to
overcoming the institutional barriers that slow down its independent
contribution to cyber security and cyber security politics. Universities
can help the public actors at the national and international level to
catch up in their technology competence, while educating the next
generation of experts for society and industry.
**[Academia]{.underline}** [can contribute to the study of **cyber
conflict** and through its **independent**]{.underline} [and
peer-reviewed **knowledge**]{.underline} [broaden the knowledge base for
some of the **difficult**]{.underline} [policy choices discussed
above]{.underline}. [Science can collaborate with the **private** and
**public actors**]{.underline} [in the development of **evidentiary
standards**]{.underline} and [norms that will underpin the **future
resilience**]{.underline} [of sociotechnical systems]{.underline}, and
[in the negotiation and establishment of new norms and institutions that
should govern the use and misuse of these systems. Yet in order to free
its full **potential**]{.underline}, [universities must overcome the
**institutional barriers** that]{.underline} slow down
**[interdisciplinary]{.underline}** [and more so **transdisciplinary
research**]{.underline} [intersection of science,
technology]{.underline}, while [building a network of institutions and
programs that together can considerably expand the body of **public
knowledge**]{.underline} surrounding these societally and politically
relevant questions.

is partially manifest in the credo that everyone is primarily
responsible for their own cyber-security.]{.underline} Such thinking
echoes with the strong political ideal of subsidiarity that demands the
leanest role of the state possible. Th[e responsibility of individuals
in the security of the whole collective is highlighted through calls
towards more awareness and prevention campaigns,]{.underline} informing
the broader public about cyber risks and countermeasures, thereby aiming
to improve prevention and resiliency, security concepts of the
everyday.6 Through the aim of resiliency, [the individual is
discursively constructed as being directly attached to larger security
outcomes of social collectives.]{.underline}

Of all three, [Technification is the most intriguing logic.]{.underline}
[Cyber-security 'experts' with a mostly technical background
drive]{.underline} the Swiss [discourse]{.underline} -- be they ICT
entrepreneurs, specialists, or researchers. [This reflects the
technification of the securitised cyber-security discourse, in that
privilege is given to constructing cyber-security as a primarily
technical issue]{.underline}. Other, [non-technical commentators often
preface their statements]{.underline} with "I am no technical expert,
but\..." [demonstrating the need to legitimise one's own
contributions]{.underline} to a political discourse, when one is not
considered 'technical' This [technified discourse is further visible
throughout policy solutions]{.underline}, be they the way critical
infrastructure risk is measured (i.e. calculated in complex formulas and
statistics), or the state of internet security in Switzerland is
communicated (e.g. how many percent of Swiss websites implement a
particular security technology).

Conclusion

In this contribution, we demonstrated that Swiss [cyber-security
politics can be fruitfully approached with constructivist
research,]{.underline} more specifically, [one that draws on practice
approaches]{.underline}. Of the three securitization logics as described
by Hansen and Nissenbaum, all three are present in the Swiss case, with
technification being the dominant one at present. [For democratic
politics, technification is a particular challenge.]{.underline}
[Assigning an issue to the technical realm has a depoliticizing
influence]{.underline}, [which removes it from democratic
deliberations.]{.underline} By making cyber-security an issue of the
'genius few', [technification makes contestation from those with less
technical expertise very hard if not impossible or makes it easy for
those with the most valued expertise to discredit others without
it.]{.underline} In addition, [the power of technical expertise comes
with a claim of being 'neutral' or 'a-political', and
hence,]{.underline} of being [more valid]{.underline} [than
anything]{.underline} that seems [emotional]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} based on [moral]{.underline}s.

The Swiss case also highlights interesting aspects for securitization
research and beyond. In theory, [securitization assumes that there is
one powerful actor who can make a convincing case for the exceptional
nature of a policy issue]{.underline}. [The entire Swiss political
system works against this]{.underline}. [**There are always multiple
voices and multiple audiences to convince** -- which makes it much
harder to be successful in a simple securitization move based on
urgency]{.underline}. In such a political system, **[less 'visible'
bureaucratic actors need to be studied more thoroughly.]{.underline}**
Security is not mainly the domain of security elites and politicians.
Instead, the [research focus needs to shift to everyday security
practices]{.underline}, to less traditional security actors, and to
actors outside government that have a central role in the creation of
danger knowledge and everyday security.

Beyond securitization research, it is evident that [looking closely at
the **intricacies of political systems, power distribution and political
culture,**]{.underline} as studied by scholars in comparative politics
and similar fields, [becomes necessary to understand security logics in
any policy field]{.underline}. **[Bringing the two research traditions
more closely together]{.underline}** in some form of conversation across
sub-disciplinary boundaries **[could be beneficial for
both.]{.underline}**

**Cyber securitization is inevitable AND good -- recognizing the threat
is key to developing necessary protections**

between digital rights and national security in cyberspace.

CYBERSPACE," Royal Holloway University of London, 2019,
https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-cyber-security-dilemma-and-the-securitisation-of-cyberspace(dcf65dd5-c75d-40ce-8994-6da979eaa1e7).html

5.2 SHOULD CYBERSPACE BE DESECURITISED?

[**Desecuritisation** is the process by which an issue is removed from
the security sphere and is **no longer considered to be an urgent
threat**]{.underline}, requiring exceptional measures to counter. For
the Copenhagen School, 'it means not to have issues phrased as "threats
against which me have countermeasures" but to move them out of this
threat-defense sequence and into the ordinary public sphere' (Busan, et
al., 1998, p. 29).

But [**desecuritisation is difficult to achieve once an issue has been
accepted as threatening** and **desecuritisation does not guarantee than
an issue will become re- politicised** and re-open to public
debate]{.underline}. [If securitising moves are rejected forcefully
enough, then **issues can become both de-securitised and
de-politicised**]{.underline} (See Figure 5.1). [This means that **not
only are the issues considered non- threatening, but they are also
closed for discussion**]{.underline}. Islamic extremism and immigration
are issues that are often difficult to discuss in a political
environment because they are either securitised as existentially
threatening or de-politicised because the responses to them are
considered threatening, racist or intolerant.

Cyberspace scholars are in general agreement that cyberspace
securitisation has mainly negative consequences. Kingsmith, for example,
discusses the negative consequences that emerge from moves by states to
securitise internet content.

Considering these securitising moves \... the more that filtering
practices are withheld from public scrutiny and accountability, the more
tempting it is for framing authorities to employ these tools for
illegitimate reasons such as the stifling of both opposition and civil
society networks (Kingsmith, 2013, p. 1).

Deibert also highlights the negative consequences of the securitisation
of cyberspace, including the resultant threats to basic freedoms.

[There has been a **growing recognition of serious risks in
cyberspace**]{.underline}. The need to manage these risks has led to a
wave of securitization efforts that have potentially serious
implications for basic freedoms (Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010, p. 49).

Whilst arguing that the securitisation of cyberspace is negative and
inevitable, Deibert also contends that the form of [this
**securitisation can be influenced**. 'The **securitization of
cyberspace may be inevitable**, but what form that security takes is
not']{.underline} (Deibert, 2012, p. 274). He suggests that it is better
to securitise threats to human rights than to securitise threats to
national security. Mariya Georgieva takes this further, citing the
Snowden disclosures as an example of the securitisation of digital
rights, arguing that Snowden had 'successfully shifted the focus of the
securitisation of cyberspace from values such as the survival of the
state and effective national security to the survival of privacy and
personal choice' (Georgieva, 2015, p. 44). Whilst she celebrates this
shift she does not explain why it is better to securitise privacy rather
than national security. Helen [Nissenbaum is one author who does take a
more consequentialist approach to cyberspace securitisation, arguing
that **it might be justified when the threat is as extreme** as its
proponents claim.]{.underline}

[If those who subscribe to a conception of security as cybersecurity are
right, particularly **if the magnitude of threat is as great as those on
the extremes claim, then an extraordinary response is warranted despite
its chilling effects**]{.underline} (Nissenbaum, 2005, p. 73).

However, this approach is rare and most literature is either critical of
state surveillance and the securitisation of cyberspace, or is
complimentary of Edward Snowden and supportive of the securitisation of
individual privacy. Given that a narrow majority of the British public
support greater efforts to protect national security it is surprising
that academic literature is weighted so strongly towards criticisms of
state surveillance and the securitisation of national security (Pew
Research Centre, 2016). Even when cyberspace securitisation by non-state
actors is addressed, such as in Georgieva's work on Snowden as an
alternative securitizing actor, [these forms of securitisation are
**considered positive** because they **support human
rights**.]{.underline} In the US and UK, academics have also been
politically active in opposing state surveillance. In 2014 over one
thousand scholars from a wide range of disciplines formed the 'academics
against surveillance' campaign, which published an open letter
criticising state surveillance (Electronic Frontier Foundation, 2014).

Whilst there is disagreement over whether desecuritisation is always
best and what types of securitisation should be reversed, there are a
variety of means through which desecuritisation can be achieved.

### 1AR\-\--Securitization Good

**Even if cyber securitization is bad, it's inevitable and necessary --
their alt ensures infrastructure attacks and cyber crimes**

**Pickin 12** -- MA in War Studies and University of London

Matthew Pickin, "What is the securitization of cyberspace? Is it a
problem?," University of London, 2012,
https://www.academia.edu/3100313/What_is_the_securitization_of_cyberspace_Is_it_a_problem

In analysing the problems of securitization, major issues have been
raised. Threat inflation, surveillance, militarisation and the
military-industrial complex are only some of the most prominent issues.
[There are **benefits of securitization** however]{.underline}, and at
the very end of this analysis [it]{.underline} will be explained why
**[securitization is necessary for now]{.underline}**. The main
supporting arguments for securitization include, the future of
cyber-attacks in conflicts, protecting critical infrastructure and
cyber-crime.

The 2010 National Intelligence Annual Threat Assessment stated that [the
United States was under a severe threat of cyber-attacks]{.underline}
(Blair, 2010). Due to the amount of infrastructure connected to the
internet in the United States targets for cyber-attacks are nearly
unlimited, as a superpower the United States presents a valuable target.
"As the world's hegemonic power, [the United States is also the **main
target** state that dissident groups, terrorists, and rogue states wish
to damage]{.underline} (Valeriano & Maness, 2011, p. 145)." [Therefore,
the **United States must have some defence, or offensive capability in
order to protect itself from future conflicts and attacks on critical
infrastructure**]{.underline}. In Foreign Affairs William J Lynn the
former deputy secretary of defence wrote that the centrality of
information technology in the United States makes it a prime target. He
argued that extending advanced cyber-defences was crucial for the
American economy, and also stated that [**failure of critical
infrastructure** would **compromise national defence**]{.underline},
"Our assessment is that [**cyber-attacks** will be a **significant
component** of future conflicts]{.underline} (Lynn, 2011)." Therefore
**[in order to protect the United States, the government has been forced
to securitize the issue]{.underline}**. According to William J Lynn an
attack could compromise national defence; therefore the issue is very
high in the national security agenda. In the article, he also addresses
the critics who argue that cyberspace is at risk of being militarized
and states that US cyber strategy has been designed to prevent this from
happening, "Far from militarizing cyberspace, U.S. cyber-strategy will
make it more difficult for military actors to use cyberspace for hostile
purposes (Lynn, 2011)." [In **securitizing cyberspace** and creating
advanced cyber-defences and cyber-weapons the United States is
**preparing for any future conflict or attack.** If such an attack or
conflict is a real existing threat then it is **beneficial to prepare
through securitization**]{.underline}, otherwise the disadvantages
clearly outweigh any advantage.

[The other **main benefit** of **securitizing cyberspace** would be
**tackling cyber-crime**]{.underline}. According to the security company
Sophos, in the first six months of 2010 it received 60,000 new malware
samples every day. Apart from malware, cyber-crime covers many different
areas such as financial, piracy, hacking and cyber-terrorism. [These
crimes are growing due to the constantly evolving communications system
of social sharing of data]{.underline}, online data storage and social
networking, "Although cybercrime has formed a hidden shadow and a kind
of evil doppelganger to every step of the Internet's long history from
its very origins, its growth has suddenly become explosive in recent
years by virtually any estimate (Deibert & Rohozinski, Contesting
Cyberspace and the Coming Crisis of Authority, 2012, p. 28)." Both
Deibert and Rohozinski argue that the rise is cyber-crime has become a
big problem for states, in 2011 counterfeiting and copying cost the
Asia-Pacific region almost \$21 billion. Certainly cyber-space has
become a rewarding way to commit crimes with little risk of prosecution,
"Cybercrime has elicited so little prosecution from the world's law
enforcement agencies it makes one wonder a de facto decriminalization
has occurred (Deibert & Rohozinski, Contesting Cyberspace and the Coming
Crisis of Authority, 2012, p. 29)." [Due to the trouble of cyber-crime,
**the only way of combating it effectively would be greater state
regulation and intervention**]{.underline}. With the whole of
cyber-space effectively securitized by the United States due to the
threat to national security by technological and social shifts, the
government is asserting itself increasingly to counter these threats.

Conclusion

In analysing what was the securitization of cyberspace, the beginnings
of the cyber-debate in the United States have been examined; this
country was used due to reliance on information technology and the
status as a superpower. The securitization model from the Copenhagen
school of thought was used to understand how issues are non-politicized,
politicized and eventually securitized. A different range of security
bills have been examined with this model to understand what was needed
for cyberspace to become a securitized issue. With the definition of
securitization dependent on the terms of national security, the changing
definition of this concept was also examined. Securitization has
occurred due to an evolving history whereby the military have understood
the potential of information technologies in warfare and where
vulnerabilities have been recognised that could damage national
security.

In evaluating whether securitization of cyberspace is a problem, it is
very clear that securitization is a growing concern with many
complications. There are many issues including privacy, regulation,
surveillance, internet regulation and the growing tension in the
international system. However, [because the United States is a
superpower contesting with other cyber-heavyweights such as Iran, Russia
and China **the issue will not be de-securitized in the short
term**]{.underline}. With the discovery and use of cyber-weapons, [many
states are in the process of making their own for defensive and
offensive purposes. The government of the **United States will not
de-securitize the issue of cyberspace while there are rival states and
groups which prove a threat to the national security
agenda**]{.underline}. These problems will continue to exist until there
is no defensive agenda and the issue is de-securitized, [for now
**securitization is a necessary evil**.]{.underline}

Cluster 1: [The **reality of cyber conflict**]{.underline}: Explaining
state restraint and practices

[In the **beginning** of this **intellectual history**, political
aspects of **cyber security**]{.underline} [were discussed almost
**exclusively** in publications]{.underline} originating in U.S.
**[think tanks]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[war
colleges]{.underline}** (for example: Arquilla & Ronfeldt, 1992). [This
literature had **little ambition**]{.underline} to contribute to an
academic debate. The two main questions it tackled were "who (or what)
is the biggest danger for an increasingly networked
nation/society/military/business environment" and "how to best counter
the new and evolving threat."

[The]{.underline} first [cluster is characterized by a
**reevaluation**]{.underline} [of the threat based on **empirical
evidence**]{.underline} [and a **gradual application**]{.underline} [and
adaption of "**old**]{.underline}" **[IR]{.underline}** [and strategic
studies]{.underline} [concepts to **cyber security**]{.underline}
(Kello, 2013). [Two cyber incidents]{.underline}--[the discovery of
**Stuxnet**]{.underline} [in 2010 and later the **Snowden
disclosures**]{.underline} in 2013--[were **instrumental**]{.underline}
in [shifting the focus of both **policymakers**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[researchers]{.underline}** [from the **threat
politics** of "**what if**]{.underline}"-[scenarios that had dominated
the 1990s and early 2000s]{.underline} [to the **reality** of the
**strategic use**]{.underline} [of **cyberspace**]{.underline} [by state
actors.]{.underline} In this new context, [literature in **IR**
and]{.underline} **[strategic studies]{.underline}** [could be used to
examine how **state actors**]{.underline} [use cyber instruments for
their **political** or **military advantage**]{.underline} and analyze
their impact on national and international security (Borghard &
Lonergan, 2017; Kello, 2017; Maness & Valeriano, 2016). [A strong
disciplinary]{.underline} "**[pull]{.underline}**" is [visible in how
early works **zoomed**]{.underline} in [on an alleged **offensive
advantage**]{.underline} in [cyberspace due to the ubiquity of technical
vulnerabilities (Peterson, 2013), grappled with the problem of
**escalation dynamics** in cyberspace]{.underline} (Liff, 2012), and
asked how deterrence might be adapted in order to uphold stability in
cyberspace (Wilner, 2019).

As researchers began to build data sets of cyber operations (Kostyuk &
Zhukov, 2019; Valeriano & Maness, 2014) to link cyber issues to the
larger agenda of conflict studies, [an empirical puzzle emerged that
**challenged** many of the **theoretical tenets**]{.underline} [and
standards assumptions of the **older literature**]{.underline}. Most
cyber operations did not seem escalatory, nor were they determined by
power asymmetries or changed the existing strategic balance.
**[Overall]{.underline}**, [states seemed to exercise a fair
amount]{.underline} of **[restraint]{.underline}** in cyberspace
(Gartzke, 2013; Gartzke & Lindsay, 2015; Valeriano & Maness, 2015).
**[At the same time, however]{.underline}**, [a lot of cyber operations
linked to **state rivalries occurred**]{.underline}, though as mere
add-ons to existing conflict dynamics and not independent of a broad
range of other foreign policy instruments (Betz & Stevens, 2011).

Reacting to this puzzle, the literature in this cluster has begun to
move in two directions: First, and comparable to the evolution of the
strategic studies literature during the nuclear age, some
[authors]{.underline} have started to integrate additional non-systemic
explanatory factors into their analyses of cyber conflict. While some
[explore the role of beliefs]{.underline} [and **cognitive
biases**]{.underline} in cyber policy decision making (Gomez, 2019),
[others]{.underline} zoom in on the destabilizing role of bureaucratic
politics and other deficiency of the policy process especially in crisis
decision making. Second, and more consequentially, many authors
acknowledge that the emerging empirical picture reflects the structural
feature of cyberspace as an operating environment, which is marked by a
high degree of technical interconnectedness and constant political
contestation (Fischerkeller & Harknett, 2018; Smeets, 2018). Taking this
into account, operating strategically in cyberspace seems to be more
technically and organizationally demanding than the "cheap and
easy"-metaphor suggests, while at the same time offering little enduring
strategic gains in the sense of changing a rival's political goals
(Lewis, 2018; Slayton, 2017).

**[2AC\-\--Realism Good]{.underline}**

**A focus on the state is still necessary and appropriate. Critical
approaches fail because they focus on [theory]{.underline} and
[abstraction]{.underline} over empirical data.**

In 2006, [Eriksson and Giacomello stated]{.underline} that the
discipline of international relations (**[IR]{.underline}**) [was
struggling to **apply**]{.underline} [its]{.underline} varied
theoretical [toolbox]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the topic of **[cyber
security]{.underline}**, therein [detecting]{.underline} "great
[difficulties for theoretical adaptation]{.underline} and application in
analyses of the complexities of the emerging new digital world" (p.

to]{.underline} interlinked [changes occurring in the
**fields**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[technology]{.underline}**,
[politics, and **science**]{.underline}, [research that applies
**international relations**]{.underline} [or **security**]{.underline}
studies [theory to different facets of the]{.underline}
**[phenomenon]{.underline}** [is no longer as **rare**]{.underline},
inviting us to look at this emergent body of research in depth at this
point in time (for a similar undertaking see Deibert, 2017a, 2017b).

This special issue displays the latest wave of cyber security politics
research. The articles position themselves mostly in a post-positivist
research tradition and use a set of different theories and conceptual
frameworks to analyze the current state of cyber security in politics.
Some articles examine the contested nature of public attributions of
cyber incidents, the norm-setting day-to-day behavior of intelligence
agencies, and discuss the consequences for governments and governance.
Another group of articles explores the knowledgeshaping practices of
IT-security companies, the co-production of risks and vulnerabilities by
technology and experts, and aim at better understanding the role of
firms and experts in strategic state interactions.

In this introductory article, we provide the intellectual history to
situate the literature in its broader evolutionary context. In a first
part, inspired by Buzan and Hansen's framework from their "The Evolution
of International Security Studies" (2009), we discuss six drivers that
have been influential in the evolution of (Western) cyber security
politics and how it is studied. In a second part, we identify three
clusters of research. In each of them, we highlight the interplay
between technological possibilities and political choices of state
actors in combination with scientific factors. [The focus on "**the
state**]{.underline}" [is]{.underline} **[appropriate and
necessary]{.underline}**, [because **security** politics is **inevitably
tied** to questions of **authority and power**]{.underline}. That said,
[the state is not the **only**]{.underline} [important actor in this
space]{.underline}--rather, [it is at the **intersection**]{.underline}
[between state and nonstate actors, nationally and
internationally]{.underline}, [that the **specificities**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[cyber security]{.underline}** [politics
emerge]{.underline}.

In the conclusion, we use these same drivers to look into the possible
future of cyber security politics research. We claim that it should not
be conceptualized as a sub-field of anything, so that inquiry is not
overly restricted by the disciplining power of disciplines. Cyber
security transcends levels of analysis, necessitates considerable
interdisciplinary knowledge, and will be shaped by the availability of
new data and methods. Its relevance for society is likely to become even
bigger in the future, with new digital technologies expanding the
spatial boundaries of cyberspace and with new complex issues emerging.
Scientific knowledge of both the problem-solving and the reflexive kind
is crucial to understand what politics these technologies will have and
how they will be linked to broader socio-economic changes affecting the
society, the economy, and the state in the future.

Factors driving the evolution of cyber security politics research

Mapping a body of research is no trivial and certainly no purely
objective undertaking. In order to simplify and abstract, a series of
choices have to be made about what to include and what to exclude. As
critical cartographers know, "\[m\]apping is epistemological but also
deeply ontological -- it is both a way of thinking about the world,
offering a framework for knowledge, and a set of assertions about the
world itself" (Kitchin, Perkins, & Dodge, 2009, p. 1). First, we hone in
on "cyber security politics," highlighting two areas that help to
structure the debate. What we aim for in these pages is an understanding
of cyber security politics that is flexible enough to deal with the
dynamics of the phenomenon, yet precise enough to demarcate the research
focus sufficiently to be of use. Second, and loosely following Buzan and
Hansen (2009), we identify six driving forces that explain the dynamic
co-evolution of cyber security politics and the academic engagement with
it. These factors help us to understand what researchers choose to write
about, what subjects and issues they define as the main cyber security
problem(s) and which ontologies, epistemologies, and methods carry
legitimacy (Buzan & Hansen, 2009, pp. 39--40).

Staking out cyber security politics

What is "cyber security" and how is it related to security politics? Far
from allowing a straightforward answer, this question lies at the heart
of the political and academic debates about the issue. First, cyber
security is a relatively new term for a set of older practices around
the security of computer networks (Von Solms & Van Niekerk, 2013).
Second, definitions for the term are contested, exemplified by the
refusal of some state actors to agree on a common vocabulary (Giles &
Hagestad, 2013). Third, the meaning of the term is changing across time.
Not so long ago, a limited circle of experts discussed cyber security
primarily as a technical risk management issue in critical information
infrastructure protection. Now the highest government circles deal with
cyber security as a key challenge of national security (Dewar, 2018).
Fourth, parallel to the advancing digitalization of ever more aspects of
the economy, society, and politics, cyber security concerns are
expanding to additional policy domains (Dunn Cavelty & Egloff, 2019). In
sum, cyber security is at the same time moving upwards in the political
agenda and expanding sideways as a problem area to a multitude of
additional policy domains.

Simple and static definitions are not well suited to deal with
constantly changing contexts. However, if we look down on the conceptual
space from a sufficient height, we notice that cyber security politics'
common ground is characterized by two main factors: First, by digital
technologies, specifically their use and misuse by human actors in
economic, social, and political contexts; and second, by enduring and
often highly conflictual negotiation processes in formal and informal
settings between the state and its bureaucracies, society, and the
private sector, geared towards defining roles, responsibilities, legal
boundaries and acceptable rules of behavior.1

The first dimension is tied to the use of a set of distinct digital
technologies and how these technologies are linked to broader
conceptions of socio-economic changes (Papp, Alberts, & Tuyahov, 1997).
The marriage of computers and telecommunications, the integration of
these technologies into a global multimedia system, and their worldwide
inexpensive availability is the bedrock for heralding multiple, rapid
and consequential transformations in production, management, societal
interaction, and governance (Schwab, 2018) though it remains to be seen
just how revolutionary these changes will really be. The most pertinent
questions in cyber security politics with regard to digital technologies
are what their characteristics are, what actions they make possible and
which ones they restrain, but also who develops them in what ways and
why and who has the power to shape their use and misuse.

The second dimension is tied to the role of states and their engagement
with other actors nationally and internationally. "Security" in cyber
security politics can be read in two ways: As cyber security politics
(the security political aspects of the issue) or as cyber security
politics (the politics engaging with questions of cyber security more
broadly). This ambiguity is deliberate because we consider the question
of what type of politics emerges under what kind of rules and with what
kind of boundaries to be crucial. From a theoretical point of view, the
question of how much politics there is or should be in security--and how
much security in politics--allows us to link research in cyber security
to debates in security studies (Hagmann, Hegemann, & Neal, 2019).
Importantly, the state has different roles in cyber security, ranging
from security guarantor, legislator and regulator, to threat actor and
danger to society and other states (Dunn Cavelty & Egloff, 2019). Hence,
cyber security politics are defined by national and international
negotiation processes about the boundaries of the responsibilities of
state, economic, and societal actors and the agreement or disagreement
over the means these actors use. This second dimension includes the
projection of power by certain actors, like the control over populations
and information flows, and the push-back against it as well.

Six driving factors

In their intellectual history of international security studies, Buzan
and Hansen develop a framework of five interrelated factors (2009, pp.
39-- 100)--great power politics, technology, key events, academic
debates, and institutionalization--that drove the evolution of the
field. For cyber security politics, we propose a slightly different
framework, purporting that changes in research are linked to changes in
the empirical phenomenon, whereby these changes can go both ways: A
research phenomenon often influences directions of research, but
research also illuminates aspects of the phenomenon that have gone
unnoticed before. We focus on the interrelationship between technology
and the world of policy and state practice--on what political actors say
they are doing and on what they are doing in the field of cyber security
as a political issue, both nationally and internationally, often in
relation to other actors--and on the different ways to observe this
interrelationship (Figure 1). The intellectual history of cyber security
politics is thus shaped by the interplay of three broad spheres:
Technology, Politics, and Science.2 Technological dynamics interact with
social and political dynamics. Technological possibilities and
constraints influence socio-economic processes. In turn, political
preferences and contexts shape the evolution of digital technologies.
This also applies fundamentally to the actors developing these
technologies and to the dynamic interplay of cyber security markets and
cyber security politics. Within each of the three spheres, we identify
two main drivers. In different combinations during different times,
these six factors stimulate or dissuade scholars from picking up
specific research questions. A summary can be seen in Table 1, with a
more detailed description in what follows.

Technology as a driver

It seems like an obvious choice to include "technology" as a category,
since the issue of cyber security is linked to the development and use
of cyberspace, a technological environment entirely built by humans. Yet
scholars have rightly pointed out that the vision of one unique
cyberspace is itself based on a social construction (Bingham, 1996;
Graham, 1998). Indeed, the conception of what cyberspace is and what can
be done with it has changed considerably throughout its history,
highlighting the needfor historically contingent understandings of the
development and use of technologies. However, a core characteristic of
IR scholarship's dealing with digital technology is "technological
determinism" (Herrera, 2003). The majority of IR approaches chooses to
deal with technology as an exogenous variable (McCarthy, 2018, p. 4),
seeing technologies as a material objects or power resources that drive
social change or as neutral tools that acquire meaning only through
their use (Leese & Hoijtink, 2019).

In contrast, we understand technologies as embodiments of societal
knowledge in the tradition of science and technology studies (STS), as
sites where power relations can be seen in operation and where the
shaping and coordination of the behavior of social and political actors
happens (Behrent, 2013, p. 57). During the design stage of technologies,
the intentions, norms, and values of their developers find their way
into the artefacts, while existing power structures influence the
desirability of specific aspects or forms of technology. Once
technologies diffuse, they are often given particular meanings and
acquire purposes other than the one initially intended by their
developers (Matthewman, 2011), but always within certain inescapable
material bounds (see also Fischerkeller & Harknett, 2018). For example:
A pen can be used for writing, but it can also be used to stab someone.
It can, however, not be used to make phone calls.

\[\[Table Omitted\]\]

That digital technologies "have politics" is hardly a contested
statement (Deibert, 2003, 2013; DeNardis, 2014; Mueller, 2010; Price,
2018). Design decisions made by engineers in the late 1960s have
implications until today, especially for security. From the early
prototype phase as ARPANET (1967- 1972) to the gradual development into
"the Internet" (1973-1983), technological protocols that define how data
is exchanged were written in an egalitarian spirit (Naughton, 2016). The
decision to have a system with minimal rules that had no central power
and no censor was deliberate and based on philosophical and political
beliefs of the technical community (Berners-Lee, 1999). Cyber security
as we understand it today became an issue only gradually, when the
system architecture changed from large proprietary machines with little
connection to "smaller and far more open systems (not built with
security in mind) coupled with the rise of networking" (Libicki, 2000),
yet still ran on the same basic protocols.

The perception that cyberspace is creating and perpetuating insecurity
with potentially catastrophic consequences is shaped by different key
events linked to the technological sphere as a second important driving
factor. In line with what we noted above, these events are not
understood as causal forces that unidirectionally influence politics or
science (cf. Buzan & Hansen, 2009, p. 54ff.) but rather as interrelated
catalyzers. The category consists of events outside the cyber realm with
influence on cyber security politics (examples include 9/11, the Snowden
revelations, or the Arab Spring), and cyber incidents themselves. In its
most basic form, a cyber incident is a disruption that challenges the
normal operation of digital technologies. Undesired change inside
machines create technical effects. Yet these technical effects alone are
not sufficient to explain the salience of cyber security in politics.
Between the initial effect in the machine and the political effect lies
a knowledge production process that creates an incident embedded in a
specific social context. A technical effect needs to be discursively
linked to something with sufficient social or political value to become
security politically relevant--which also explains why only some cyber
incidents reach that stage while others do not (Balzacq & Dunn Cavelty,
2016).

Such moments of disruption highlight previously hidden characteristics
of socio-technical artifacts, opening up opportunities for the study of
new aspects of the phenomena that were not easily observable before or
did not seem important (Best & Walters, 2013, p. 346; Latour, 1999).
Incidents are also linked to another fundamental issue in the study of
cyber security: the availability of data. Our current knowledge about
cyber security relies heavily on data from commercial threat reporting
and news reports. Yet this data provides a partial and biased view of
cyber threat activity, because it is often politicized and influenced by
the demands of powerful buyers and the interests of capable providers
(Lindsay, 2017).

Politics as a driver

The discipline of **[IR]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} mainly
[interested in patterns of **cooperation**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[conflict]{.underline}** [among
**states**]{.underline} [and how these patterns relate to shifts in the
distribution]{.underline} and **[character of power]{.underline}** [in
the international system]{.underline}: international power politics.
[As]{.underline} the issue of **[cyber security]{.underline}** [gained
in importance in **state interactions**]{.underline}, [experts and
policy makers pondered whether **digital technologies**]{.underline}
[gave rise to a "**new**"]{.underline} type of **[power]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [how this power source would influence the
**existing** power **distribution**]{.underline} [in the
system]{.underline} (Nye, 2011). Given that IR began as an "American
discipline, was focused on American security and written by Americans"
(Buzan & Hansen, 2009, p. 51), the debate about the security
implications arising from the spread of information technologies also
originated in America, with a series of implications for how the subject
was studied. Though definitions vary, cyber power is understood as the
use of resources related to cyberspace to achieve specific (political)
ends inside and outside of cyberspace (cf. Nye, 2010, p. 3). In the
contemporary U.S. setting, a discourse of simultaneous empowerment and
disempowerment characterized the conceptual debate from the beginning.
While the technological realm carried the promise of wielding a new sort
of power, it highlighted new dependencies and vulnerabilities at the
same time (Rattray, 2001).

Apart from giving the digital domain a particular weight in the broader
questions that IR scholars are interested in, [we]{.underline} also
[need to consider]{.underline} [how]{.underline} **[international
politics]{.underline}** [influence the **use** of **these
technologies**]{.underline}. [Given the **interconnection**
between]{.underline} **[technology]{.underline}** [and politics, we can
expect the **overall state** of **world politics**]{.underline} to [have
a noticeable influence on the forms of **use**/misuse of]{.underline}
**[these technologies]{.underline}**. [Buzan and Hansen call this larger
context "**patterns of enmity** and amity between **great
powers**]{.underline}" (2009, p. 52). [This highlights questions of
cooperation and conflict]{.underline}, about the formation of alliances
and the maintenance of strategic stability, about the proliferation and
control of dual-use technologies, but also about the efforts of states
to come to international agreements in the form of norms and
institutions.

[In our conception of politics, the **international
dimension**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} just **[one
aspect]{.underline}** [of a broader set of political
interactions]{.underline}. [Cyber security is **not only**]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} **[enmity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[amity]{.underline}** [and the potential for]{.underline}
**[war]{.underline}** and peace. In fact, [it is not very often about
situations of great urgency]{.underline}, [but more often]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} "**[normal" domestic politics]{.underline}**. Like
many other complex policy issues, **[cyber security]{.underline}** is
[cutting across different areas of **responsibility**]{.underline},
[requiring coordination and cooperation between a wide **variety** of
**public actors**]{.underline} at different levels of government, but
also actors from business and society When government tasks and
authority are delegated downwards (localization), upwards
(supranationalization), or sideways (privatization) (Krahmann, 2003),
governance in networks becomes important. Under such conditions,
governments no longer simply issue instructions and monitor their
implementation, but seek to shape the framework conditions so that
cooperation operates as smoothly as possible even without constant
oversight (Peters & Pierre, 1998; Salamon, 2002), coming with a set of
challenges for state-society relationships.

Science as a driver

The last two factors are situated in the realm of science that is
understood here as a collective term for "academic work," "intellectual
labor," or "knowledge production." Like Buzan and Hansen (2009, pp.
57-65), we focus on academic debates and on institutionalization. This
introduces an element of internal conflict into our intellectual
history, because even if academics would agree on the key events or
issues that need to be studied, how they would study it would still
differ widely. As a case in point, cyber security politics research is
no subfield of anything--it is characterized and united by the
engagement with a multifaceted and dynamic phenomena, but the
disciplinary approaches used, the ontological and epistemological
choices, vary greatly.

Debates about ontology, epistemology, and methodology are at the heart
of some of the most fruitful key debates in security studies, but at the
same time they divide the discipline. [The biggest
**cleft**]{.underline} [exists between **problem-solving** theories and
**critical theories**]{.underline}: the former do not explicitly
question the prevailing social and power relationships, while the latter
problematize these very relationships by analyzing their origins and
their evolution (Cox, 1986). [Which of these two approaches is
**favored**]{.underline} [in certain research settings however
**depends**]{.underline} [on many different factors]{.underline}
(Bourbeau, Balzacq, & Dunn Cavelty, 2015). Building on decades of IR
scholarship, **[traditional approaches]{.underline}** [have seen
**incremental**]{.underline} **[theoretical innovation]{.underline}**
[since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. By [contrast, **critical
approaches**]{.underline} [have gone through a phase of rich
**theory**]{.underline} development [and are only
**slowly**]{.underline} [becoming ripe for **empirical
work**]{.underline} based on critical methods (Aradau, Huysmans, Neal, &
Voelkner, 2014). The key focus of interest has been the analysis of the
(social) power relations that underpin security policies in liberal
states, highlighting security as a powerful political technology for
social (and political) control (Dillon & Reid, 2009); as a collection of
discourses that serve to empower and reproduce hierarchies (Shepherd,
2008); or as routinized and patterned practices carried out by
bureaucrats and security professionals (Bigo, 2002). These overall
research trends have an important impact on cyber security politics
research, since the topic has been picked up by all approaches, leading
to distinct takes on what cyber security politics is and how it should
be studied.

**[Automation]{.underline}** [doesn't change the fact that
**diplomats**]{.underline} and embassies [still matter]{.underline}.
**[Foreign policy]{.underline}**, like all politics, [is a factor of
**human condition**, including sense, gut feeling and cultural cues,
along with its **imperfections**]{.underline}. [However, there is a
**clear trajectory** whereby **states** that can best **adapt** to
automation -- in war, **foreign policy** and economy -- will develop
more **efficient ways** of dealing with the challenges of
an]{.underline} **[interconnected]{.underline}**,
**[data]{.underline}**-centric **[world]{.underline}**.
[Diplomacy]{.underline} too, can [retain its **relevance**]{.underline}
[and influence over **politics** between **nations**]{.underline}, so
[long as it can properly designate areas where
**automation**]{.underline} [can help and where it can't]{.underline}.
Although all **[states]{.underline}** [will come up with their **own
answers**]{.underline} to these questions, [based on their **own
individual interests and needs**]{.underline}, the common direction in
which automation and foreign policy is headed is more or less similar
for all countries. In the future, diplomacy has to build data processing
and management capabilities, with dedicated departments and scientists
supporting diplomats and negotiators on the ground. The structure of
this new framework will also heavily depend on regime type, scope of
foreign interests and alliance behavior.

[The structural shadow of **uncertainty**]{.underline} over diplomacy is
[stronger than ever]{.underline}. [Some]{.underline} communicative
rituals and **[practices]{.underline}** of diplomacy [are]{.underline}
[growing]{.underline} more **[obsolete]{.underline}**, as modern
political communication slides increasingly to short and sharp rhetoric,
coupled with automation tools that bombard audiences at unprecedented
levels. **[Diplomacy itself]{.underline}** [is **hardly obsolete
however**]{.underline}, [as the task of mediating and **negotiating
power relations**]{.underline} [is perhaps as important as it was during
the **Cold War**]{.underline}. [**New power** centers -- in the form of
technology companies and big data brokers -- are **changing** the
**state-centric parameters**]{.underline} of **[classical realism
perhaps]{.underline}**, [but the **inherent dynamics of power
realignment**]{.underline} [still render **diplomacy** a **crucial
endeavor**]{.underline}. [To rise to the challenge however, modern
diplomacy has to develop a strong computational]{.underline}
**[capacity]{.underline}**, [able to adapt to the changing nature of
**digital communication**]{.underline} [and advances in
