Political Policy and Institutional Arrangements

The fact that a given cyber threat or incident crosses the threshold of
political concern is without prejudice to its political and legal
characterisation for the purpose of developing an appropriate response.
Much will depend on political policy perceptions -- are cyber threats
and incidents predominantly perceived as human rights (i.e. data
privacy) issues, matters of law enforcement and/or homeland security300,
or matter of national security and defence -- and the different roles
played by the government agencies involved on the examination and
assessment of cyber threats and incidents, and competent to adopt or
contribute to actual responses. Accordingly, [it may be for multiple
reasons]{.underline} [that **NATO faces challenges**]{.underline} [in
**developing consensus** regarding]{.underline} [the **full
integration**]{.underline} [of **cyber**]{.underline} security and
[**defence** in its **respective mechanisms**]{.underline}, as well as
the necessary institutional arrangements.

First, [in an environment where any security]{.underline} [and defence
discourse is to a **great extent predetermined**]{.underline} [by the
**level of political concern**]{.underline}, [there may]{.underline}
simply [have been a **limited number of opportunities**]{.underline} [to
actually put cyber security]{.underline} and defence **[prominently on
NATO\'s agenda]{.underline}**. Second, quite similar to threats arising
from international terrorism, [threats]{.underline} arising
[in]{.underline} and out of the [cyber space may give rise to both
**internal**]{.underline}, or homeland, [and **external security
concerns**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} thus [trigger
the]{.underline} oftentimes **[complex delineations]{.underline}** [of
competence between the defence]{.underline}, [law
enforcement]{.underline}, [and intelligence sectors which]{.underline}
many NATO Nations [have developed into]{.underline} [strong checks and
balances amounting to a **separation of powers en
miniature**]{.underline} [within]{.underline} their [executive branches
of government]{.underline}. Whilst obviously [such **domestic
arrangements lack** the **capacity**]{.underline} [to **affect** the
**interpretation**]{.underline} [and **application**]{.underline} [of
the **North Atlantic Treaty**]{.underline}301, [they may
nevertheless]{.underline} **[de facto challenge]{.underline}** NATO
Nations\' Defence Ministries\' as well as Armed Forces\' [ability to put
cyber]{.underline} security and [defence on NATO\'s policy]{.underline},
[concept]{.underline}, [and **doctrine agendas**]{.underline}. [To
date]{.underline}, **[no well-entrenched method]{.underline}**,
[structure]{.underline} [or process]{.underline} [for
**overcoming**]{.underline} [this de facto challenge]{.underline} --
e.g. through involvement of foreign intelligence, homeland security
and/or law enforcement stakeholders -- [**exists** within
NATO]{.underline}. Third, [there is a **near complete
lack**]{.underline} [of **NATO-wide**]{.underline}, **[standardised
doctrine]{.underline}** [for cyber warfare]{.underline}. [The resulting
absence]{.underline}, amongst NATO Nations, [of a **militarily agreed**
and **legally cleared**]{.underline} (Article 36 of GP I) [understanding
concerning]{.underline} [the means and]{.underline}
[methods]{.underline} [of cyber warfare]{.underline} [may also
**contribute** to the **lack of political policy
consensus**]{.underline}. [The appetite for engaging in
hostilities]{.underline} which might be perceived as potentially
involving legally doubtful means and methods of warfare [may be
**limited**]{.underline}. [Ultimately]{.underline}, [the **absence of
consensus**]{.underline} [regarding **jus in bello**]{.underline} [may
thus have **repercussions**]{.underline} [on the **likelihood that
consensus can be reached**]{.underline} [concerning]{.underline} jus ad
bellum as well as **[collective]{.underline}** security and
**[defence]{.underline}**.

In addition, [the potential]{.underline} [for NATO to play a **bigger
role**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [defending the information
infrastructure by]{.underline} **[implementing]{.underline}** [a
**credible cyber deterrence strategy**]{.underline} [is **limited by
political disagreements**]{.underline} [on the
**conditions**]{.underline} [and **circumstances**]{.underline} [which
would **prompt**]{.underline} [any **collective response**]{.underline}
[to cyber attacks]{.underline}. NATO is currently focusing on
implementation of an active cyber defence strategy, with improved
security standards and requirements. While improved defence will to a
certain extent dissuade potential aggressors, this is of course not
enough for it to be considered as a real deterrent in its own right. For
actual cyber deterrence (by punishment), there is the prerequisite that
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty be considered applicable to cyber
attacks. In this respect the [NATO Policy]{.underline} on Cyber Defence
[reiterates that]{.underline} [any collective defence
response]{.underline} [is **subject to political
decisions**]{.underline} [of the **North Atlantic
Council**]{.underline}, [and that NATO will **remain
flexible**]{.underline} [on how it will respond to cyber
attacks]{.underline}. [This flexibility can be interpreted]{.underline}
in two ways: as a deliberate position calculated to keep potential
aggressors in a state of uncertainty regarding the consequences they
might face, or [as a **sign** that the Alliance]{.underline} [has
**difficulty** in **achieving consensus**]{.underline} [on a **firm
response option**]{.underline}. In the first case the aggressor might
indeed be dissuaded from attacking NATO's information networks by fear
of an unforeseeable retaliation. Unfortunately, however, [leaving
response options unspecified creates]{.underline} [a degree of
**ambiguity**]{.underline} [which might be perceived]{.underline} [as
**reflecting political disagreements**]{.underline} [among]{.underline}
the [Allies]{.underline} on when and how NATO should intervene. If this
were indeed the case, it might actually give an adversary good reason to
favour cyber attacks over other forms of action against the Alliance's
-- or the individual Allies'-- critical infrastructure. In other words,
the rationale for a cyber attack would be that
**[political]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[conceptual
divergences]{.underline}** [within NATO]{.underline} [might]{.underline}
**[delay]{.underline}** [the **consensus required**]{.underline} [to
**trigger** a]{.underline} **[collective response]{.underline}**. Here,
an interesting historical parallel is often drawn with the ambiguity
regarding NATO's nuclear deterrence in Europe during the Cold War: the
point made by some analysts is that the experience of nuclear deterrence
as practised by NATO and other actors can be usefully applied to the
cyber domain, insofar as nuclear deterrence doctrine prevented nuclear
conflicts. Unfortunately, nuclear and cyber deterrence differ
significantly in both technical and strategic terms. Attackers might
thus interpret the perpetuation of ambiguity in NATO's nuclear and cyber
retaliation posture as additional proof not only of political
disagreements, but even of strategic misunderstanding.

Such an interpretation must unfortunately be taken seriously. Cyber
attacks can take various forms, depending on their objectives and
techniques -- ranging from espionage, organized crime and disruption to
outright destruction. [Determining which category a specific type of
attack falls into will **largely depend**]{.underline} [on
**legal**]{.underline} [and **political considerations**]{.underline}
[at the **national level**]{.underline}.
**[Interpretations]{.underline}** might thus **[vary]{.underline}**
[from one country to another]{.underline}, [to the extent that a given
action might be considered an act of war by one member state but not by
another]{.underline}. [This **severely jeopardizes**]{.underline} [the
**political consensus required**]{.underline} [to **initiate collective
defence measures**]{.underline}. [The **resulting
difficulty**]{.underline} [in **defining** a **threshold**]{.underline}
[for **collective response**]{.underline} and an appropriate form of
retaliation [might in turn lead to a **considerable
weakening**]{.underline} [of NATO's **strategic credibility** in cyber
defence]{.underline}.

[**NATO was caught off guard** when the crisis started in
Ukraine]{.underline}. **[At the beginning]{.underline}**, [Russia's
**hybrid warfare** strategy]{.underline} of deception, ambiguity, and
denial [**complicated** attribution and response, and rendered **the
decision-making process** more difficult for NATO]{.underline}. The
Alliance did not manage to assess the environment correctly.27 As Major
General Gordon Davis, the United States general in charge of operations
and intelligence at NATO's military headquarters in Belgium during the
Ukrainian crisis, admitted, it took some time for the Alliance to
determine the "size and the scale" of the troop reinforcement, which was
continuously denied by the Russians.28

Russian President Putin masterfully played off the regional divisions
within NATO during his slow-rolling invasion of Eastern Ukraine.29 The
crisis shed some light on the fact that the sense of insecurity is not
the same in all NATO countries. Despite significant pressure from the
United States and NATO's worried Eastern European members, countries
enjoying good relations with Russia, notably France, Germany and Italy,
refrained from challenging Russia, and tried to mitigate the crisis via
diplomacy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated she was "convinced
that there is no military solution to this conflict, adding on the other
hand that no one could be sure they would manage to achieve a truce
through talks," such as those between Merkel, Hollande, and Putin.30

And so the Russian methodology outflanked NATO's reaction policies, with
the Alliance and its 28 members remaining bystanders, though there was
clear potential for the conflict to spread far beyond Ukraine. The
course of the conflict also proved paradoxical: Germany, for instance,
delivered military equipment to the Iraqi Kurds in the Middle East but
not to desperate Ukraine.31 France's focus on operations in Mali and the
Central African Republic during the Ukrainian crisis also highlighted
the superiority of national interests over the collective in the
Alliance.

[**However, subsequent** Russian **activities bolstered solidarity**
among the Alliance **and all members agreed upon** political and
military **measures** that broke the tangled relations between NATO and
Russia]{.underline}. [The **Wales Summit** became a **cornerstone of
solidarity and cohesion** for the Alliance, as the allies agreed upon
measures to counter the Russian threat]{.underline}. The RAP sought to
ensure a rapid and firm response to new security challenges. The [RAP
includes assurance measures, designed to reassure the Alliance's worried
members]{.underline} (especially in Eastern Europe) [of NATO's
solidarity and commitment against Russian aggression]{.underline}.
[These include **continuous**]{.underline} air, land, and maritime
[**presence and activities** in Eastern Europe]{.underline},
specifically in the Baltic countries and Poland, [on a rotational
basis]{.underline}. As a result, the Alliance increased its air-policing
activities over the Baltic States, enhanced naval patrols in the Baltic
Sea, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean, commenced AWACS (Airborne
Warning and Control System) surveillance flights over eastern Allies,
deployed ground troops to the eastern members for training and
exercises, and conducted three hundred NATO and national exercises in
2015 alone.

The [**RAP** also **has adaptation measures that envisage major
structural** and functional **changes in NATO's military
system**]{.underline}. [Specifically expected to enhance the Alliance's
capabilities is the reorganized NATO Response Force]{.underline} (NRF),
set up after the Prague summit in 2002 and [including the new Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force]{.underline} (VJTF) of around 5,000 troops,
some of are deployable within 48 hours. [The size of the enhanced NRF
has since tripled]{.underline} to around 30,000 troops, composed of
land, air, naval and special operations forces. The [**RAP insists on
responsiveness** and, above all, on the mutation of the NRF into a new,
revitalized model.]{.underline}

During the Warsaw Summit in 2016, [the Allies also decided to
**establish a forward presence** of multinational troops in the eastern
regions of the territory]{.underline}, in order to reassure worried
member countries, just as during the Cold War the Alliance's strategy
included demonstrating solidarity, cooperation, and cohesion. As the
Warsaw Summit declaration has it, Alliance members "have decided to
establish an enhanced forward presence in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and
Poland [**to unambiguously demonstrate**, as part of overall posture,
the Allies' solidarity, **determination**, and ability **to act** by
triggering an immediate Allied response to any aggression.]{.underline}

In addition to RAP, the [leaders also approved the **New Strategy on
Hybrid Warfare** during the Foreign Ministers' Meeting in December
2015]{.underline}. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg described the new
strategy: to prepare, to deter, and to defend. [He stressed the Alliance
requires many different kinds of capabilities in order to defend its
population, since hybrid threats are themselves so diverse in nature,
and he **outlined the key elements**: increased responsiveness and
readiness of NATO forces, of intelligence, and of surveillance; improved
situational awareness; the use of special operations and of cyber
capabilities; and **close cooperation** with the European
Union.]{.underline}

[The framework]{.underline} of the New Strategy on Hybrid Warfare
[enhanced the Alliance's counter-hybrid-threat
capabilities]{.underline}. [**Improved situational awareness** through
enhanced intelligence and reconnaissance, and better **information
sharing** between allies]{.underline} as well as other international
organizations, [constitutes one of the main developments]{.underline}.
[The Alliance aimed to **quickly identify** low-level attacks or
indications of impen**ding hybrid warfare**, in order to **reduce**
ambiguity and **surprise**, as well as to **enable more precise**,
timely, and correct **decision-making**]{.underline}

The [**Special Operations Forces** are expected to **provide strategic**
and operational **support** for the Alliance's efforts]{.underline},
[most especially in effectively countering irregular warfare
elements]{.underline}, as they are more effective in this realm than
regular forces. For this reason, [the **integration** of special forces
into the NRF and VJTF **constitute another key measure** adopted in the
New Strategy]{.underline}. The first demonstration of this integration
took place during the Noble Jump exercise of June 2015, when NATO
deployed VJTF based on scenario that Poland was under threat of
irregular warfare. The deployment made clear in terms of potential
aggression against Alliance members, Russian irregular warfare is seen
as far more likely than conventional warfare.

Arguing that Russia resorted to massive and effective cyber assaults
against both Ukraine and NATO countries, [the **Alliance enhanced** its
**cyber warfare capabilities** as well]{.underline}. A February [2016
technical agreement launched a joint program]{.underline} with the
European Union, which initiated the exchange of information and incident
data, [in order to boost situational awareness of cyber
threats.]{.underline}35 The Alliance also began to study the legal
background of the relation between cyber assault and common defense. The
statement by NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg that "a major cyber
attack against the Alliance could trigger a collective response"36 has
made clear that cyberspace is likely to be an important operational
domain in future.

Additionally, [**NATO opted to counter hybrid threats by** pursuing **a
comprehensive approach across all** military, diplomatic, economic,
information, and social **levers available to the** international
**community**]{.underline}. [Cooperation and coordination with other
partner countries and international organizations]{.underline},
especially with the European Union and Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), [is recognized as key to countering hybrid
threats; in particular in this regard, the **critical civilian assets**
and civil issue capabilities **of the European Union.**]{.underline}

Both [during]{.underline} and after [the Cold War, Russia enjoyed an
advantage over NATO in speedy decision-making and deployment of
forces]{.underline}, as well as in the use of special forces. Ever since
the establishment of the NATO Alliance, authority to deploy troops, and
the use of these troops, has constituted a critical issue between member
nations and NATO officials. [During the June Defense Ministerial meeting
in 2015, **leaders** decided to **grant authority to SACEUR to prepare**
troops **immediately** when the Allies deem it necessary, thereby
**accelerating the** military **reaction process**]{.underline}. [As a
result, when SACEUR sees an unfolding crisis he is authorized to
mobilize NATO's new VJTF and send troops to the nearest flight line, to
await final orders for takeoff]{.underline}. Authority from the
Alliance's highest decision-making body---the North Atlantic
Council---must be granted before actually deploying the troops.37 In
this way, member countries retained final authority for use of the
troops.

[**The new measures** were adopted to **deter**, **dissuade**, and
**challenge Russian hybrid warfare**]{.underline} in addition to a
Russian conventional assault against the Alliance---the latter scenario
described by Putin himself as only a madman's fantasy.38 [**The Alliance
is militarily stronger**, **swifter**, and **more capable of responding
to any Russian hybrid threat**, particularly **against a member
country**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, political determination will
remain a key factor in challenging Russia.

Deterrence by denial (i.e., an ability to deny Russian objectives by
defensive measures) is only possible for NATO at the lower rungs of this
ladder, and NATO has not been idle here either. In fact, most of the
early [measures taken by NATO]{.underline} in response to the annexation
of Crimea [fall into the deterrence of denial category and centre on
rapid reaction capacities,]{.underline} especially in the shape of a
NATO Response Force (NRF) upgraded for deterrence purposes. [The NRF now
has a **reinforced**, quicker spearhead---a Very High Readiness Joint
Task Force potentially up to 13,000 troops strong, and then two
complementing brigades with support]{.underline} (each 13,000 strong)
[forming a layered, sizeable reaction force explicitly linked to
**collective defence** purposes]{.underline} and regularly exercised in
Eastern Europe and the Baltic states.35 [In 2016, in response to the
foreseeable difficulties of projecting mainly Western forces into zones
of conflicts close to Russia, NATO decided to established an "enhanced
forward presence"---]{.underline}four multinational battalion-sized
battle groups ---[in the Baltic states and Poland]{.underline}, and a
"tailored forward presence"---mainly naval forces---in the Black Sea
region. Whether these forces can credibly "deny" Russian objectives in
the case of limited war is a bone of contention. [Most observers and
sometimes NATO itself employ the descriptor "tripwire" to these
forces]{.underline}, thus [indicating that they are triggers that
promise to unleash NATO's big guns]{.underline} and therefore part and
parcel of deterrence by punishment. However, [US diplomats]{.underline}
(interviewed on background) feel more [confident]{.underline} that the
US battalion embedded (in Poland) in [the collective forward presence
posture would]{.underline} actually [be able to fight and survive, and
thus **deny Russian objectives**]{.underline}. That may be so, in which
case the conclusion is that NATO has a moderate-to-low---and
geographically focused---capacity for deterrence by denial and then a
more general and impressive capacity for deterrence by punishment.
[NATO's unquestionable capacity for deterrence by denial is rather found
at the **level of grey zone**, non-kinetic conflict]{.underline}. In
this regard, [NATO has **upgraded** not only its **cyber defences** and
enhanced intelligence coordination, as mentioned, but has **enhanced
coordination** with the European Union on hybrid threats]{.underline},
[with a 2016 joint declaration leading to a common work program and a
collaborative Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid
Threats]{.underline}, located in Helsinki, the 2016 adoption of societal
resilience benchmarks that, while mostly falling outside NATO's
political-military remit, nations must meet, and finally the decision in
2018 to [organize counter-hybrid support teams that can tailor
assistance to individual allies and circumstances]{.underline}.36 NATO's
full range of actions in response to Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea
---a range to which this brief overview can do only limited
justice---thus combines deterrence by denial (grey zone conflict,
societal resilience, reaction and forward deployed forces to counter
limited land grabs) and deterrence by punishment (the full chain of
reaction and deployable forces, from conventional to nuclear). [NATO's
strong suit is the military piece of this posture, but it has
considerably adapted to grey zone conflict scenarios in an effort to
achieve a **comprehensive deterrence** posture vis-à-vis Russia's
unified]{.underline} (kinetic and non-kinetic) [and
uninterrupted]{.underline} (all domains, in war and peace) [doctrine of
"new generation warfare".]{.underline}

[The most significant long-term challenge facing American and British
cyber agencies is not China or Russia --- it's a shortage of cyber
talent]{.underline}. [This workforce deficit isn't only affecting

looked at 11 countries' cyber skill shortages and extrapolated that the
global deficit of qualified personnel sits at over four million unfilled
positions and argues that the workforce needs to grow by a staggering
145 percent. [Government agencies struggling to match the lucrative
private sector salaries on offer naturally find themselves on the back
foot]{.underline}. Cyber reserves, conscription models, and [the use of
volunteers](https://warontherocks.com/2018/01/estonias-approach-cyber-defense-feasible-united-states/)
are often touted as a panacea for boosting government recruits. Yet,
[[calls for a cyber
reserve](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1490.html) are not
enough]{.underline}. Cyber reserve models are often impractical and fail
to materially address nascent policy challenges. While cyber reserves
can certainly play a limited role in improving security, states such as
Britain and the United States should instead continue to focus on policy
initiatives that are better aligned with their political cultures and
operational requirements. Working with the private sector provides more
scalable reinforcements and enables a coordinated approach to protecting
what is often predominantly privately-owned infrastructure. Both
approaches can certainly co-exist, yet robust public-private
collaboration will often trump the whims of volunteers. Practical
Limitations of Cyber Reserves Calls for [expanded cyber
reserves](https://warontherocks.com/2019/09/the-presidents-own-as-a-model-for-the-marine-corps-cyber-auxiliary/)
underestimate the logistical challenges of implementation. [This has led
to [many policy
proposals](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/young-people-should-do-national-cyberservice-jshrhkf9l)
failing to address the nature of cyber operations or the lengthy
timelines often involved]{.underline}. As much as anything, [both
offensive operations and securing networks are a collection of practices
that require full-time staff and an organized approach]{.underline}.
[Most large government departments defend their networks 24 hours a
day]{.underline}. Security operations centers run around-the-clock
monitoring for potential threats. Likewise, [vulnerability management
programs, used to patch high-severity flaws, require constant vigilance
and active coordination in order to stay ahead of the
threat]{.underline}. Within these contexts, [full-time staff who have
experience working together develop continuity and established workflow
patterns to ensure threats aren't missed.]{.underline} Cyber espionage
campaigns are no different. It is assumed that operations conducted by
prominent state espionage groups, often [referred to as advanced
persistent threats](https://collierjam.com/apt-simplistic-as-123/), rely
on technical wizardry alone. Yet, [rather than their ability to exploit
flashy zero-day vulnerabilities or deploy highly bespoke malware, it is
often their operational capabilities that make the
difference]{.underline}. This was captured by National Security Agency
and former cyber security White House advisor Rob Joyce, who [stressed
that targeting large corporate networks requires plenty of patience and
focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDJb8WOJYdA&t=39s). This is
largely due to the [variety of
stages](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00396338.2016.1142093)
involved in cyber operations. This can include extensive open source
research on employees ahead of sending phishing emails, putting in the
hours to fully understand a target's infrastructure, or waiting for the
right moment to move laterally within a network. Crucially, successful
operations often come down to gritty abrasion[. Full-time staff, shift
patterns, and established routines are at the foundation of a successful
campaign. Supplementary staff waltzing in with the occasional weekend or
evening to spare might be able to contribute]{.underline}, yet these
operational realities limit their ability to substantially move the
needle.

Second, [Western offensive cyber operations might **spark war.** U.S.

cryptocurrency wallets of Russia's sanctions-avoiding kleptocrats? He
[might feel the need to escalate his own cyber operations]{.underline}
as part of his own version of defending forward. **[Escalation could
happen on the battlefield as well]{.underline}**. [According to the New

Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/us-ukraine-weapons.html),
teams from U.S. Cyber Command are "in place to interfere with Russia's
digital attacks and communications." Other teams are almost certainly
collecting digital intelligence on the location and intent of Russian
combat forces. [The United States is sharing such intelligence with the
Ukrainians but [apparently not yet providing any real-time
targeting](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/biden-administration-walks-fine-line-intelligence-sharing-ukraine-rcna18542).]{.underline}
That may change soon, as the United States seeks to alleviate
intensifying attacks on civilians. And with his KGB-bred paranoia,
[Putin might already see the presence of U.S. defensive and intelligence
teams operating on or against Russian military networks as evidence of
direct U.S. involvement in the war.]{.underline} Confirming his apparent
belief that Ukraine is just a NATO puppet, this might force a response,
either inside or outside of cyberspace. Further, [if Western
governments]{.underline} have [infiltrated Russia's operational military
networks, they may feel pressure to disrupt those networks]{.underline}
to prevent civilian massacres. Because cyber capabilities are billed as
non-lethal, reversible, and non-escalatory, tub-thumping newspapers may
push decision-makers to take shots they might not otherwise: "We can't

and [Olympic
Destroyer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/technology/winter-olympic-games-hack.html)
attacks, are less likely to be viewed as mere crimes. Repeated crises
bordering on war may further erode the tacit agreements and relative
restraint of quieter times. After repeated iterations of intensifying
cyber operations, both Russia and the West may feel their backs to the
wall with few options left other than military force when the next
crisis --- physical or cyber --- emerges. Under extreme conditions, some
of the same characteristics that lead cyber capabilities to be a
pressure release might have the opposite effect, a mechanism that Bob
Jervis and I have described as the [Escalation
Inversion](https://tnsr.org/2020/09/the-escalation-inversion-and-other-oddities-of-situational-cyber-stability/).
If Putin believes a direct conflict with NATO is likely and expects its
adversaries to [take measures to reduce
vulnerabilities](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/a-new-era-in-u-s-russian-strategic-stability),
he could conclude that the best possibility for success is to launch a
massive preemptive cyber attack. Since the U.S. military may seem
otherwise unbeatable, this [may
lead](https://www.brookings.edu/book/surprise-attack/) Russia to
"compensate with audacity in order to redress the balance." [The more
the United States **brags about its overwhelming offensive cyber
advantage**,]{.underline} but frets over weak defenses, [the more any

as hard as

Creating Unnecessary Vulnerabilities [Prioritizing offensive operations
can **increase adversaries' fears**, suspicions, and **readiness to take
offensive action**]{.underline}. Cyber [offenses include cyber
exploitation (intelligence gathering) and cyberattack]{.underline}
(disrupting, destroying, or subverting an adversary's computer systems).
An [adversary can easily mistake defensive cyber exploitation for
offensive operations because the distinction is a matter of intent, not
technical operation]{.underline}. [The difficulty of distinguishing
between offensive and defensive tactics makes mistrustful adversaries
**more reactive**, and repeatedly conducting offensive cyber operations
only **increases distrust**]{.underline}. A focus on [offensive
operations]{.underline} can also **[increase
vulnerabilities]{.underline}**; for example, secretly stockpiling
information about vulnerabilities in computers for later exploitation,
rather than publicizing and helping civil society to mitigate those
vulnerabilities, leaves critical infrastructure vulnerable to attack.
The skills and organizational capabilities for offense and defense are
very similar. Defense requires understanding how to compromise computer
systems; one of the best ways to protect computer systems is to engage
in penetration testing (i.e., controlled offensive operations on one's
own systems). [The similarity between offensive and defensive skills
makes it **unnecessary to conduct offensive operations** against
adversaries to maintain offensive capability.]{.underline} Thus, rather
than stockpiling technologies in the hope of gaining offensive
advantage, states should develop the skills and organizational
capabilities required to innovate and maintain information and
communications technologies. Managing Complexity The complexity of
information systems gives the offense certain advantages for purely
probabilistic reasons. [Imagine a race: offense and defense go hunting
for randomly distributed vulnerabilities, with the offense attempting to
exploit those vulnerabilities and the defense aiming to patch them. The
number of vulnerabilities grows with the **size and complexity** of the
computer system]{.underline}, as do the technological advantages of
offense---at least in principle. [With a vast number of vulnerabilities,
it is **unlikely** that the defense will be able to find and patch every
vulnerability before the offense finds and exploits it.]{.underline}
Technology is, however, embedded in social organizations, and
organizations can help the defense better manage complexity. Those that
develop software can check for common errors before making
hardware-software systems available for use. [The defender has complete
access to its computer system, whereas the attacker has a more limited
set of attack vectors.]{.underline} Organizations can help skilled
defenders by establishing good cybersecurity processes, such as
continually scanning for vulnerabilities and updating software.
Assessing Kinetic Effects To date, failures of cyber defense have
largely been failures of management, and the successes of offense are a
result of its relatively simpler goals. [Offense, like defense, becomes
more difficult as its goals become more complex.]{.underline} In
particular, the advantages that complexity offers the offense in
cyberspace diminish in the physical world. [Computers controlling
physical machinery can be hacked, but achieving particular physical
effects, such as covertly sabotaging nuclear enrichment facilities,
requires knowledge of the physical processes that the computers control,
not merely knowledge of the computers. Much of the detailed knowledge
needed to run an industrial control system is tacit]{.underline}, passed
from one engineer to another but never written down, let alone stored on
a computer. [Gathering such information requires traditional espionage
by humans on the ground, which is both expensive and risky]{.underline}.
A cost-benefit analysis of Stuxnet for both the offense and the defense
demonstrates why [damaging physical infrastructure is **more costly**
than simply infiltrating information networks. The costs of Stuxnet were
likely far greater for the offense (the United States and Israel) than
for the defense (Iran), and Stuxnet was relatively ineffective, setting
back Iran's nuclear program by fewer than three months]{.underline}. The
great expense of Stuxnet was intelligence; though digital espionage can
be used to obtain some kinds of information, the knowledge needed to
disrupt a physical control system, such as the detailed methods and
settings used to control pressure in Iran's nuclear centrifuges, is not
generally held in computers. The costs for both sides are dominated not
by technology but by skilled labor---for example, hackers who identify
and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, systems administrators who manage
and defend computer systems, and the nuclear engineers who understand
enrichment processes and the means of disrupting them. In addition,
assessing costs alone is misguided: [the perceived benefits of attacking
with and defending from Stuxnet (i.e., the value of Iran's nuclear
weapons program) greatly exceeded the costs for both the offense and the
defense]{.underline}. This is one reason not to be complacent about the
need to secure industrial control systems and critical infrastructure:
[though cyberattacks on such systems will be costly, a determined
adversary may be **willing to pay the cost** to achieve its
aims]{.underline}. Conclusion The common assumption that the offense
dominates cyberspace is dangerous and deeply misguided. The
offense-defense balance can be assessed only for specific operations,
not for all of cyberspace, as it is shaped by the capabilities of
adversaries and the complexity of their goals in any conflict. When it
comes to exerting precise physical effects, [cyberspace **does not offer
overwhelming advantages** to the offense]{.underline}. Because the
capabilities of offense and defense are similar, [improving defensive
operations allows preparation for cyber offense without **risking
geopolitical instability** or increasing vulnerability to
attack.]{.underline}

**An offensive cyber posture [fails]{.underline} and [causes
escalation]{.underline}.**

The Myth of the Offense

Contrary to observed patterns of limited disruption and espionage, Cyber
Command sees cyberspace as a domain fraught with increasing risk, where
great powers such as China and Russia will undermine American power. The
only solution, from this perspective, is to go on the offense. Yet, [the
benefits of an offensive posture]{.underline}, especially [in
cyberspace]{.underline}, [are]{.underline} mostly
**[illusory]{.underline}** to date. Instead, [the cyber domain tends to
be optimized for defense and deception]{.underline}, not decisive
offensive blows. [Not only is offense likely the weaker form of
competition in cyberspace]{.underline}, [it also **risks inadvertent
escalation**]{.underline}. [The fear]{.underline},
[suspicion]{.underline}, [and misperception that characterize interstate
rivalries **exacerbate** the **risk** of offensive action in
cyberspace]{.underline}.

[Cyber Command's 2018 persistent-action strategy aims to]{.underline}
"[expose adversaries' weaknesses]{.underline}, [learn their intentions
and capabilities]{.underline}, [and counter attacks close to their
origins]{.underline}."44 Put in simple terms, the best defense is a good
offense: get on adversary networks and stop cyber operations targeting
the United States before they occur. [Under this strategy]{.underline},
[offensive cyber operations will also be **preemptive**]{.underline} in
that they are designed to "contest dangerous adversary activity before
it impairs \[U.S.\] national power."45 To use another sports metaphor,
come out swinging. Go on the offense first and establish escalation
dominance (that is, demonstrating such superior capabilities over the
target state that it can't afford to escalate in response).46

According to Cyber Command, preemptive strikes will "impose . . .
strategic costs on our adversaries, compelling them to shift resources
to defense and reduce attacks."47 Whether through punishment, risk, or
denial strategies, offensive actions theoretically alter the target's
behavior by increasing the expected costs of targeting U.S. interests.48
Offensive action, according to this thinking, deters future aggression
by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance. Yet, [there
are well-established reasons to doubt that offensive options produce the
intended results in cyberspace]{.underline}.

Defense and Deception

[The rationale behind persistent action]{.underline}---[that the best
defense is a good offense]{.underline}---[is **deeply
flawed**]{.underline}. In fact, [most military and strategic theory
holds that the defense is the **superior posture**]{.underline}.49 For
example, Sun Tzu describes controlling an adversary to make their
actions more predictable, and hence easy to undermine, by baiting them
to attack strong points.50 [The stronger form of war is a
deception-driven defense]{.underline}: [confusing an attacker so that
they waste resources attacking strong points that appear
weak]{.underline}. This parallels cybersecurity scholars Erik Gartzke
and Jon Lindsay's claim that [cyberspace is **not offense
dominant**]{.underline}, [but **deception dominant**]{.underline}.51
Rather than persistent action and preemptive strikes on adversary
networks, [the United States needs **persistent deception**]{.underline}
[and **defensive counterstrikes**]{.underline} [optimized to **undermine
adversary planning**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[capabilities]{.underline}**.

Fear and the Security Dilemma

[New policy options proposed by Cyber Command]{.underline} and the Trump
administration **[risk exacerbating fear]{.underline}** in other
countries [and creating a **self-reinforcing spiral**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[tit-for-tat escalations]{.underline}** [that ri**sk
war** even though each actor feels]{.underline} [he is acting
defensively]{.underline}---or, as it is called in the scholarly
literature, a security dilemma.52 As shown above, most cyber operations
to date have not resulted in escalation. The cyber domain has been a
world of spies collecting valuable information and engaging in limited
disruptions that substitute for, as well as complement, more
conventional options. [Shifting to a policy of **preemptive offensive
cyber warfare** risks **provoking fear**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[overreaction]{.underline}** [in other states and possibly **producing
conflict spirals**]{.underline}. [Even]{.underline} limited-objective
cyber offensive action defined as "[defending forward]{.underline}" [can
be misinterpreted and lead to inadvertent escalation]{.underline}.53 As
the historian Cathal Nolan puts it, "intrusions into a state's
strategically important networks pose serious risks and are therefore
inherently threatening."54

More worryingly, [with a more offensive posture]{.underline}, [it will
be **increasingly difficult** for states]{.underline} [to differentiate
between cyber espionage and more damaging degradation
operations]{.underline}.55 What the United States calls defending
forward, China and Russia will call preemptive strikes. Worse still,
[this posture will likely lead great powers to assume all network
intrusions]{.underline}, including espionage, [are preparing the
environment for follow-on offensive strikes]{.underline}. According to
cybersecurity scholar Ben Buchanan, "in the \[aggressor\] state's own
view, such moves are clearly defensive, merely ensuring that its
military will have the strength and flexibility to meet whatever comes
its way. Yet potential adversaries are unlikely to share this
perspective."56 [The new strategy risks producing a]{.underline}
"**[forever cyber war]{.underline}**" [prone to **inadvertent
escalation**]{.underline} [because it implies all cyber operations
should be interpreted as escalatory by adversaries]{.underline}.57

The Myth of Decisive Cyber Victory

[There is a tendency in the military profession]{.underline}, at least
in the United States and Europe, [to uphold the concept of decisive
battle as central to the Western way of war]{.underline}.58 Often,
[disruptive technologies]{.underline}---from strategic bombers in the
mid-20th century to cyber operations in the 21st century---[are seen as
providing decisive offensive advantages in crises]{.underline}. In the
interwar period between the world wars, airpower enthusiasts argued that
bombers would reliably reach their targets, forcing political leaders to
end hostilities or face the prospect of destroyed cities and economic
collapse.59

[Yet the search for decisive battle is]{.underline} [often an
**elusive**]{.underline}, [if not **dangerous**]{.underline},
[temptation for military planners and policymakers]{.underline}. In a
comparative historical treatment of major 19th- and 20th-century
battles, Nolan argues that "[often]{.underline}, [war results in
something clouded]{.underline}, [neither triumph nor
defeat]{.underline}. [It is an arena of **grey outcomes**]{.underline},
[partial and ambiguous resolution of disputes and causes that led to the
choice of force as an instrument of policy in the first
place]{.underline}."60 Decisive victories in any one battle are rare.
Adversaries can refuse to fight.61 They can even signal resolve through
demonstrating their ability to endure pain.

**Offensive operations are escalatory and fail.**

Planning and Assessment Pathologies

[The]{.underline} [new policy framework for offensive cyber operations
**risks compounding common pathologies**]{.underline} [associated with
strategic assessments and planning]{.underline}. 62 **[Removing
interagency checks]{.underline}** [increases the risks that an operation
will **backfire** on the attacker]{.underline} [or **compromise ongoing
operations**]{.underline}.

[**Misperception** is **pervasive**]{.underline} [in insulated
decisionmaking processes]{.underline} for several reasons.63 First,
[small groups unchecked by bureaucracy tend]{.underline} [to **produce
narrow plans**]{.underline} [prone to escalation during
crises]{.underline}.64 Second, [leaders often give guidance to planners
during crises]{.underline} [that reflects their political
bias]{.underline} [or personality traits rather than a rational
assessment]{.underline} of threats and options.65 Third, [offensive bias
in planning may have little to do with the actual threat and more to do
with a **cult of the offensive**]{.underline} [and the desire of
officers to ensure]{.underline} [their autonomy and
resources]{.underline}.66 Removing interagency checks therefore risks
compounding fundamental attribution errors and other implicit biases.
Cyber operations are too important to be left to the generals at Cyber
Command alone.

in the West that [Russia has

an "escalate to de-escalate" nuclear strategy]{.underline}, which
[lowers the
bar](https://warontherocks.com/2016/03/three-minutes-to-midnight-closer-to-nuclear-conflict-than-we-think/)
for nuclear weapons use to a terrifyingly low level. Importantly, it's
referenced as fact in the Trump administration's new [Nuclear Posture
Review
,](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872886/-1/-1/1/2018-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-FINAL-REPORT.PDF)
which argues that the United States itself therefore needs new low-yield
nuclear weapons to deter Russia at lower levels of conflict. [But the
**evidence of a dropped threshold** for Russian nuclear employment **is
weak**]{.underline}. Moreover, even if this was Russia's doctrine, a
shift to more American reliance on lower-yield nuclear weapons would be
the wrong solution to the problem. Understanding Russian Doctrine [What
do people mean when they say "escalate to de-escalate?"]{.underline} The
words themselves are not particularly helpful. Any action that is
neither a perfectly symmetrical nor smaller response to adversary action
is escalation. [Any threat (nuclear or otherwise) to raise the costs of
conflict is a threat of escalation]{.underline}. [And countries both
escalate and threaten to do so fairly regularly as they seek to convince
adversaries to rethink plans]{.underline}. The fact is that [most
escalation is intended to, well, de-escalate.]{.underline} Western
analysts have developed a range of descriptions of Russian nuclear
strategy that all fall, with varying degrees of consistency and
contradiction, under the "escalate to de-escalate" umbrella. The [new

and political scientist [Matthew
Kroenig](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-tactical-u-s-nukes-1516836395)
hold that Russia intends to use nuclear weapons early in a conflict to
attain an advantageous battlefield outcome. So does current Pentagon
official [Elbridge
Colby.](https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/countering-russian-nuclear-strategy-in-central-europe)
[Juri Luik and Tomas Jermalavicius
believe](http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/umSnuTKFrMZggbaRv3SR/full)
Russia would turn to nuclear weapons in the face of imminent battlefield
defeat: e.g., to make up for conventional inferiority in a conflict with
the NATO alliance. [Evelyn Farkas
holds](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/15/trump-needs-a-russia-policy-or-putin-will-force-one-on-him/)
that Russia simply likes escalation, nuclear and otherwise. The notion
that Russia might use nuclear weapons on the battlefield may originate
in arguments in a 1999 paper published in the Russian military journal
Voennaia Mysl. The authors, military officers and analysts V. I.
Levshin, A. V. Nedelin, and M. E. Sosnovskii,
[posited](http://militaryarticle.ru/zarubezhnoe-voennoe-obozrenie/1999-zvo/8995-o-primenenii-jadernogo-oruzhija-dlja-dejeskalacii)
that the use of nuclear weapons in a heretofore conventional conflict
could demonstrate credibility and convince the adversary to stand down
for fear of further escalation. The argument for more nuclear steps on
the escalation ladder has been made more recently as
[well](http://nvo.ng.ru/concepts/2015-11-27/1_stairway.html). It was
even promised by a senior Russian official prior to the release of a new
military doctrine almost a decade
[ago](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/14/10/2009/5703d6e19a7947733180bb63).
[However, neither that]{.underline}
[[doctrine]{.underline}](http://carnegieendowment.org/files/2010russia_military_doctrine.pdf)
[nor the one that followed it in]{.underline}
[[2014]{.underline}](https://rusemb.org.uk/press/2029) [(the most
recent) in fact lowers the nuclear use threshold]{.underline}. As one of
us has argued
[previously](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine),
[the official statements, followed by a doctrine that did not deliver on
them, suggest that **proponents** of a lowered threshold ultimately
**lost a bureaucratic fight**]{.underline}. To this day, Russian
"escalation" advocates occasionally publish an article, still hoping to
change the policy --- but continue to fail. [Nor does Russian doctrine
call for the use of nuclear weapons if Moscow is losing a conventional
conflict]{.underline}. To the contrary, [military doctrine clearly
states that nuclear weapons will be used only in response to an
adversary using nuclear]{.underline} or other [weapons]{.underline} of
mass destruction and/[or "when the very existence of the state is
[in](https://rusemb.org.uk/press/2029)
[jeopardy.](http://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/3054726)]{.underline}"
One can argue what does and does not qualify as existential jeopardy,
but the [scenarios]{.underline} in [which Western analysts envision
Russian]{.underline} nuclear [escalation]{.underline} --- most of which
involve ending a conventional conflict --- [seem to fall short by most
definitions]{.underline}. In the past, Russia's bar for nuclear use has
been both higher and lower. In 1993, [Moscow dropped the no-first-use
pledge](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/world/russia-drops-pledge-of-no-first-use-of-atom-arms.html)
it inherited from the Soviet Union. In 2000, however, following the NATO
air campaign in Yugoslavia, Russia's new military doctrine allowed for
first use in case of large-scale conventional aggression against Russia
or its [allies](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2000_05/dc3ma00). It is
plausible that at this time, plans indeed looked something like
"escalate to de-escalate." But soon after that, proponents of reliance
on nuclear weapons found their views eclipsed by Russian government
decisions to instead invest in conventional
[forces](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/107537). At the time, this
was mainly because Russia believed [most of its battles would be
smaller-scale](http://milrf.ru/conference/cf_030604/5ru_esin.htm).
Today, however, [Russia is [increasingly
confident](https://sputniknews.com/russia/201701121049508492-precision-weapons-russia/)
that its conventional capabilities can play at least some of the
strategic deterrence roles historically played by nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} A Secret Plan to Escalate? Those who believe in a
lowered Russian threshold for nuclear use thus believe that Russia's
formal doctrine is intentionally disingenuous. [Indeed, speculation
about a secret annex to the doctrine that clandestinely lowers the
nuclear threshold
[abounds](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017-02/escalate-de-escalate)]{.underline}.
But as [Kristin ven Bruusgaard has pointed
out](https://warontherocks.com/2017/09/the-myth-of-russias-lowered-nuclear-threshold/)
in in War on the Rocks, [if Russia's goal is deterrence, **a stated
strategy** of restraint **at odds with a real strategy** of escalation
**seems counterproductive**.]{.underline} Deterrence works best when the
adversary understands which actions will trigger an undesirable
response. Three categories of evidence are offered to support the
argument that Russia's true nuclear threshold today is lower than its
doctrine indicates: exercises, capability, and rhetoric. [Like other
nuclear states, Russia runs exercises that involve [nuclear
weapons](https://www.foi.se/reportsummary?reportNo=FOI-R--4326--SE)]{.underline}.
The vast majority of these test strategic readiness, command and
control, and interoperability. In a handful of recent cases, various
sources
[have](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_01/20160128_SG_AnnualReport_2015_en.pdf)

[nuclear](https://jamestown.org/program/belarus-and-russia-prepare-zapad-2013-military-exercise/)
use was simulated in otherwise conventional Russian exercises,
supposedly boosting the evidence for "escalate to de-escalate." [It does
not, however, appear that scenarios for these exercises fit the model of
a small-scale nuclear strike early in a conflict]{.underline}---as one
of us has argued in the
[past](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/160504_Oliker_RussiasNuclearDoctrine_Web.pdf).
If one believes the strikes happened, conditions of a battlefield defeat
posing an existential threat to the state are more plausible. However,
as Bruno Tertrais explains, the evidence for simulated nuclear use in

[convincing](https://www.iiss.org/en/politics%20and%20strategy/blogsections/2018-4cda/february-e91d/does-russia-really-include-limited-nuclear-strikes-bf12).
Importantly, [Russia's most recent large-scale military exercise focused
on its Western flank]{.underline}, Zapad 2017, [did not have any evident
nuclear
[strike](https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/five-things-know-about-zapad-2017-military-exercise)
[component](https://news.err.ee/650543/michael-kofman-what-actually-happened-during-zapad-2017),
despite positing a conflict with the NATO alliance.]{.underline} Then
there's Russian capability, specifically smaller-scale, shorter-range
nuclear capabilities suitable for the battlefield. Russia maintains a
substantial legacy [arsenal](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL32572.pdf)
of nonstrategic weapons, which some may believe suggests a willingness
to use them. Moreover, in recent years, Moscow has emphasized the
development of new warfighting systems that can be deployed with either
nuclear or conventional firepower, the oft-touted Iskander being one
[example](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine).
Russia is also working on hypersonic
[systems](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine).
Finally, the "accidental" leak of plans (in the form of a presentation
slide) for a nuclear
[torpedo](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34797252) in 2015 fueled
speculation that Russia is thinking creatively about nuclear warfighting
(although the destructive power of the purported weapon would surely
have strategic, not merely "de-escalatory," effects). Some may argue
that capability is evidence enough of possible "escalate to de-escalate"
plans, and the West should therefore respond in kind. This is wrong, for
two reasons: First, weapons can be used for all sorts of things, and one
cannot plan for all possible contingencies --- only those that seem
plausible. Russia could also, in principle, plan to set off all of its
nuclear weapons at once, or fire some of them into space. If a possible
strategy is not supported by the evidence, it should not drive planning.
Second, the argument that capabilities prove intent works both ways. The
United States also has low-yield nuclear capabilities (and will have
more if proponents have their way). Should Russia therefore expect the
United States to use nuclear weapons first if American conventional
forces were losing, say in a fight against Russia over Ukraine? Indeed,
such an approach would be consistent with the American doctrine outlined
in the new Nuclear Posture Review. But while the review may make this
scenario less ludicrous than it was in the past, Russia would still be
dangerously paranoid to base its planning on the possibility. [**There
is no evidence of U.S. plans** to start an offensive war against a major
nuclear power like Russia]{.underline} or China, [much less **to use a
preemptive nuclear strike to "de-escalate" a conventional conflict**
once it went wrong.]{.underline} So what is Russia's very large
nonstrategic arsenal for, and why is it emphasizing dual-use systems?
First, as regards the nonstrategic arsenal as a whole, [Russia is quite
simply loath to give up something it has a lot of without getting
something else in return.]{.underline} Second, Moscow knows that its
nuclear capabilities make Brussels and Washington nervous. Russians did
not discuss a nuclear role for the Iskander---and, indeed, rejected the
possibility---until the Western press started describing the system as
[dual-capable.](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine)
To be blunt, if not reassuring, Moscow has noticed that an emphasis on
dual-capable systems keeps the West off-balance, and sees that as a
clear benefit. This brings us to the last category of evidence for a
clandestine lowered threshold: Russian rhetoric. While some Russian
pundits recklessly talk of turning countries to
[ash](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-kiselyov/russia-can-turn-us-to-radioactive-ash-kremlin-backed-journalist-idUSL6N0MD0P920140316),
senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have been far more
careful with their threats. Putin may
[mention](https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/europe/russia-putin-crimea-nuclear/index.html)
that the Crimea crisis could, in some contingencies, have led him to
place nuclear weapons on alert. However, this never happened, and it is
something of a stretch to interpret that as meaning he would have used a
tactical nuclear weapon to end a conventional conflict. Moreover, in the
face of recent nuclear
[rhetoric](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F03%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-nuclear-authority%2Findex.html)
from America's own president, the comments Putin has made seem almost
circumspect. [Putin's rhetoric is meant not to signal plans to use
nuclear weapons recklessly, but rather to remind any who may have
forgotten that Russia is a nuclear weapons state]{.underline}. While
this is prospectively destabilizing, it does not indicate a deep occult
doctrine, much less a doctrine that has been consistently and publicly
rejected. Russian rhetoric reflects the fact that Russia, much like the
Soviet Union before it, sees NATO posing a threat that needs to be
deterred. [Moscow continues to believe, and Russian generals in private
conversations emphasize, that any conventional conflict with NATO risks
rapid escalation without "de-escalation" --- into all-destroying nuclear
war. It must therefore be **avoided at all costs**]{.underline}. This
logic is consistent with that put forward by American scholars who have

nuclear weapons kept the peace during the Cold War. [The success of the
nuclear peace, in this view, lay in the threat of extreme
escalation]{.underline}, not the bespoke step-by-step deterrence
the Nuclear Posture Review seems to advocate and that the postulated
Russian "de-escalation" doctrine would implicitly endorse.

Since 1945," The Washington Quarterly,
https://www.frstrategie.org/web/documents/publications/autres/2017/2017-tertrais-twq-on-the-brink.pdf

**[The short answer?]{.underline}** If we are to discard Pope John Paul
II's explanation ("Divine Providence"),5 [it is that **the system
worked** and that, with rare exceptions, those in charge of nuclear
weapons have been responsible, prudent, and careful.]{.underline}
"[**Close calls**" have ranged in fact from "**not-so-close" to "very
distant**."]{.underline}

[A number of technical incidents have taken place]{.underline} since
1945, all of which led to one degree or another to nuclear precautionary
measures, generally involving the elevation of alert levels. Most of
these incidents are well documented, but one of them does not seem to
have taken place at all. It was revealed in 2015 that in the midst of
the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Mace missile squadron based in Okinawa
received a launch order.6 The ambassador of a Latin American country to
the United Nations claimed that this incident "could have altered the
course of civilization forever." 7 One should note that according to the
account---based on a single testimony---the safeguards worked: given
that the procedure was not respected (the order came at DEFCON-2,
whereas it was supposed to happen only at DEFCON-1), the unit commander
suspended the launch.8 In any case, an in-depth inquiry by Stars &
Stripes magazine at the end of 2015 did not find any confirmation of the
incident; U.S. Air Force historians did not find any trace of it.

At least a dozen real incidents took place in the United States in the
1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. (Even though there is little or no evidence
that as many happened in other countries, one should assume that some
also occurred in the Soviet Union or elsewhere.)10 In these cases, alert
levels were elevated due to a false alarm, generally caused by the
malfunction of a technical system. For instance, in 1960 a U.S. early
warning radar in Greenland confused the moonrise with a missile
launch.11 In 1961, a dysfunctional transmitter made the Strategic Air
Command (SAC) believe that its lines of communication had been cut
off.12 In 1962, a cascade of minor incidents and misinterpretation led
to bombers being put on alert.13 The same year, a rare conjunction of
events led a U.S. radar station to believe that a Soviet missile attack
was underway.14 Something similar occurred in 1967, when a solar storm
jammed three early warning radars.15 In 1980, two incidents caused by
faulty computer chips led U.S. authorities to mistakenly believe that a
Soviet attack could be underway.

In the Soviet Union, a well-known 1983 incident of the same sort was
recently publicized through a documentary entitled The Man Who Saved The
World (2014), according to which "millions of lives were hanging by a
thread," and no less than "the end of our civilization" was at stake.17
A more sobering account of the incident casts serious doubts on whether
this was actually the case. When the alarm sounded in the Soviet nuclear
command center because of a U.S. missile launch, the officer in charge
suspected that it was a mistake and requested visual confirmation. Such
confirmation never came, and the command thus stood down.

[Some incidents involve direct human errors]{.underline}. This was the
case for the infamous magnetic tape mistake of 1979, which went up the
chain of command to the U.S. presidency. Woken up by a phone call
announcing that 200 missiles were coming in the direction of U.S.
territory, National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski requested a
confirmation.19 He was informed a couple of minutes later that ten times
that number of missiles had now been detected. The cause was the
insertion of a tape used for training and exercises in SAC computers.
Nobody knows what President Jimmy Carter would have done had Brzezinski
told him that he only had a few minutes to decide, but can one seriously
believe that he would have launched a massive counter-strike in the
absence of any confirmation that an attack was underway?

In a few of these incidents, a real launch caused confusion. In 1980,
for instance, the Soviet Union launched four submarine-launched
ballistic missiles (SLBMs) as part of an exercise, and a U.S. early
warning radar wrongly judged that one of them was going in the direction
of the United States. This evaluation was quickly corrected.

The Norwegian rocket launch of 1995 belongs in the same category and has
become another poster child for nuclear dangers. However, the episode
should rather be taken as a testimony to Russian cool-headedness.
Norwegian and American scientists launched a new type of rocket, the
Black Brant XII, in order to study weather data; they had sent word of
the launch to Moscow, but the information had not reached the
appropriate authorities. Since Black Brant XII was new, large, and with
a high-altitude trajectory, its launch was interpreted as a possible
missile strike. Some in the general staff raised the hypothesis of a
highaltitude electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) detonation. Yeltsin considered
an interception, but it soon became clear that Russia was not a target.
"After the rocket emerged onto a ballistic curve, the direction of the
flight became clear, and we could see that it would in no way touch on
Russian territory, but land in the Spitsbergen region---we calmed down
and took no serious measures ... "21 Generals Vladimir Dvorkin, a
well-known Russian expert, and Eugene Habiger, former head of STRATCOM,
denied that the incident had any character of gravity.

The System Worked

[Based on the above examples, one must wonder: **is luck a necessary
hypothesis** to explain why none of these events led to nuclear
war?]{.underline} Is it not at least equally possible that since 1945,
people in charge of nuclear weapons "have taken greater care \[of them\]
than is taken in any other situation involving human agents and complex
mechanical systems"?

[Nuclear-armed countries have **set up mechanisms** designed **to
ensure** that nuclear **weapons will not be used by
mistake**]{.underline}. [This includes fail-safe procedures]{.underline}
(where non-use remains the default condition up until the last possible
moment) [as well as dual phenomenology]{.underline} (the need to confirm
the attack by two independent means relying on different physical
principles). [When The Man Who Saved The World was shown in New York
City]{.underline}, t[he Russian mission]{.underline} to the United
Nations [issued a communiqué that stated: "Under no circumstances a
decision to use nuclear weapons could be made or even
considered]{.underline} in the Soviet Union (Russia) or in the United
States [on the basis of data from a single source or a
system]{.underline}. For this to happen, a [confirmation is necessary
from **several systems**:]{.underline} ground-based radars,
early-warning satellites, intelligence reports, etc." 24 [In all the
incidents mentioned above, **safety mechanisms worked**, even in the
early 1960s **when they were still rudimentary**.]{.underline}

Furthermore, is it credible to imagine that the head of a State or
government would order a nuclear strike without being certain that a
major military attack was underway? [U.S. nuclear expert Jeffrey G.
Lewis rightly argues that he cannot imagine that an American president
would embark in nuclear reprisals if there was the slightest doubt on
the reality of the attack.]{.underline}25 Retired Russian General
Vladimir Dvorkin thinks similarly, claiming that "[**No president**, no
matter what president it is, **will ever make a decision** about
launch-on warning b**ased on information about one rocket** or missile
or even ... two or three missiles]{.underline}."

From the point of view of logic and complex systems analysis, it remains
possible that a combination of incidents can lead to the failure of all
safety mechanisms designed to prevent accidental nuclear war. Such a
thesis is embodied by the classic work of Scott D. Sagan, The Limits of
Safety. It would thus only be "a matter of time" due to cumulative
probabilities.27 In a recent documentary about nuclear risks, author
Eric Schlosser reiterates the point: "it's also due to luck, pure luck,
and the problem with luck is that eventually it runs out ... Every
machine ever invented eventually goes wrong."

[But the probability of failure increases markedly with time only if
conditions do not change---and conditions do change.]{.underline}
[Safety mechanisms have been perfected]{.underline} (without necessarily
becoming more complex) and lessons of past incidents are being learned.
Sagan claimed in 1993 that the Yom Kippur war (see below), as well as
the 1979 and 1980 incidents (see above), are proof that organizations
fail to learn from experience. But if that was the case, why would the
number of known incidents have significantly declined since 1983? We
only know of one significant incident in nearly 35 years: the Black
Brant XII episode. Charles [**Perrow**, the father of "normal accidents"
theory]{.underline} (those resulting from the complexity and
interconnection of systems), [wrote]{.underline}: "with regard to firing
\[nuclear weapons\] after a false warning we reach a surprising
conclusion, one I was not prepared for: [because of the safety systems
involved in a launchon-warning scenario, it is **virtually impossible**
for wellintended actions **to bring about an accidental
attack.**]{.underline}

**[Nuclear Crises]{.underline}**

A second type of crisis involves episodes during which there was an
alleged risk of deliberate nuclear use. One has to differentiate between
types of crises: to say that the use of nuclear weapons was "discussed"
for instance, is different from "considered" or from "planned." [A
closer look at them suggests that in most cases, there was an elevation
of alert levels and/or various forms of nuclear signaling]{.underline},
and in some cases contingency planning, [but **no evidence of
intention** of, or temptation **to**, actually **employ nuclear weapons
in almost all cases**]{.underline}. As is the case for false alarms,
many of the known cases involve U.S. nuclear forces. But there is no
evidence in the public domain that the Soviet Union ever considered the
use of nuclear weapons outside the East--West confrontation, for
instance.

False Nuclear Events

One should start with the nuclear crises that were not. Many episodes
sometimes labeled as such did not have any nuclear dimension. There was
no "nuclear ultimatum" during the Azerbaijan crisis of 1946, for
instance, despite what President Truman himself claimed.30 Nor was there
any significant nuclear dimension to the Falklands war of 1982, despite
reports to the contrary.

On some of the most-often mentioned episodes, there are important
question marks. The famous Kissinger "DEFCON 3" initiative of October
1973, aimed at deterring Moscow from intervening in the Middle East
during the Yom Kippur war, involved all U.S. forces, not merely nuclear
ones. There was never any explicit nuclear signal or threat during the
crisis, and it is far from certain that nuclear weapons per se played
any role then.

Likewise for the Kashmir crisis of 1990, a moment of high tension
between Pakistan and India. Despite initial reports to the contrary,
which were thinly sourced, it seems that there was never any significant
nuclear dimension in it--- if at all. A roundtable organized in 1994
involving participants in the crisis concluded that the two countries
were never on the nuclear brink during that spring.33 Another in-depth
study of the crisis one year later led to the same conclusion.34 There
may have been confusion between regular, unrelated Pakistani nuclear
activities and deliberate crisis-time decisions.35 The former head of
Pakistani weapons designs has stated that his country did not have a
weaponized device at the time.3

One crisis deserves a separate treatment. By the fall of 1983, a
particularly tense moment of the Cold War, NATO was conducting the final
phase (Able Archer) of its annual Autumn Forge exercise, which was more
elaborate than in previous years.37 Moscow increased the alert of a
significant number of forces including nuclear units. NATO simulated
nuclear strikes on the 9th and 11th of November. How dangerous was the
crisis? A 2008 British documentary claimed that the world had come very
close to catastrophe,38 but more information is available today. "We
knew that NATO were \[sic\] doing an exercise," said General Ivan Yesin,
then head of Soviet strategic forces.39 His opinion is reflected by
those of other former Soviet and Warsaw Pact officials.40 Note that by
November 11, even as the NATO exercise reached its climax, the Soviet
alert had been withdrawn and normal flights had resumed. Most indepth
analyses of the 1983 crisis all concur that Moscow did not really fear
an attack and that the alert was just a precautionary one.41 One should
also note that the Pershing 2 missiles, which were in Moscow's view a
possible instrument for a surprise attack, had not yet been deployed to
Germany: the first ones arrived on November 23.

Nuclear Signaling

Instances of deliberate nuclear signaling through verbal threats or ad
hoc deployments were frequent during the Cold War, and most of them have
been well documented: the Berlin blockade of 1948--1949, the Suez crisis
of 1956, the status of Berlin crisis of 1958, the U.S. intervention in
Lebanon that same year, the October 1962 retaliatory threat by President
Kennedy, the Sino--Soviet Ussuri skirmishes of 1969, the India--Pakistan
war of 1971, and the Vietnam War all belong to that category. But there
is no evidence in the public domain that such episodes included either
nuclear contingency planning or serious consideration of nuclear use.

What about India--Pakistan crises post-1998 (the year both countries
tested nuclear devices)? In 1999, there were threats on both sides, and
some evidence of an increase in alert levels of Indian missiles.42 There
is no clear evidence of the same steps being taken on the Pakistani
side: during the crisis, the head of Pakistani nuclear forces was in
Switzerland.43 This is also true for the 2001-- 2002 "Twin Peaks"
crisis, during which there is no evidence, despite some heated rhetoric,
that either of the two sides was ready to embark in nuclear
brinkmanship. A former Pakistani nuclear official reports that Islamabad
did not change the alert level of its forces during the crisis.

The Ukrainian crisis that began in 2014 has seen many small nuclear
signals, including an increase in flights of Russian nuclear-capable
bombers around the European continent. But the only known instance of a
clear nuclear-related threat by Russian authorities referred to a
hypothetical past situation. In 2015, answering a question about raising
alert levels at the height of the Crimean crisis a few months before,
Vladimir Putin said, "We were ready to do it," but seemed to refer to a
situation where Western forces would have tried to repel Russia in
Crimea, since he added, "Historically, this territory is ours. Russians
live there. They were in danger." 45 Hardly a case of nuclear coercion.

Contingency Planning

[Then we have crises where contingency planning was indeed
made]{.underline}---an indication that nuclear use was possible.
[However, there is no evidence that any political leader had his or her
"finger on the button" in any of these episodes]{.underline}. In some
cases, the use of nuclear weapons was suggested by subordinates and not
pursued further. Twice in 1950, General MacArthur suggested such use in
Korea, but his requests were rejected.46 In 1967, some in the Israeli
government seem to have considered a nuclear demonstration in the Sinai
if Egypt threatened the country's urban centers.47 In 1968, U.S.
commanders in Vietnam recommended the use of theater nuclear weapons to
defend Khe Sanh, but senior military authorities disagreed.48 In 1973,
it seems that part of Israel's nuclear arsenal was put on alert49---but
even at the darkest hour, as is now known through the testimony of a
direct witness, Prime Minister Golda Meir categorically refused the
nuclear demonstration suggested by General Moshe Dayan.50 Finally, in
1980, a Pentagon study reportedly considered the same option in case of
a Soviet invasion of Iran;51 but the contingency never came up.

The more interesting cases are those where the approach was "top-down,"
i.e. where nuclear contingency planning was ordered by the highest
political authorities. In 1954, Washington considered striking the
Vietminh's positions around Dien Bien Phu to support the beleaguered
French forces.52 President Eisenhower was reluctant: he wanted to do it
only in the case of an international intervention; he also doubted the
added value of nuclear (as opposed to conventional) weapons. In any
case, "Eisenhower never came close to approving any action to save Dien
Bien Phu," as former National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy describes.

During the 1961 Berlin crisis, nuclear options were discussed in
depth---a discussion that contributed to the emergence of the flexible
response doctrine---but only in case of a war over Berlin, which never
materialized.

In 1969, Henry Kissinger ordered the Pentagon to elaborate bombing plan
Duck Hook, designed to force Hanoi to negotiate. It is possible (though
still not certain to this day) that it included small-scale nuclear
options. The plan was shortlived.55 Despite his bravado, President Nixon
was aware of the political costs of using nuclear weapons in Southeast
Asia.56 In fact, Kissinger said later that during his time in
government, "there was no situation in which we were involved, in which
we ever made a plan for using nuclear weapons \[apart from the Single
Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP, the massive war plan to respond to a
Soviet attack)\]." 57 The famous journalist Seymour Hersh himself, a
staunch critic of the administration, admits that he never found any
evidence of an imminent use of nuclear weapons at that time.

Finally, one should mention the 1990 request by Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to evaluate the results of a use of theater nuclear weapons on
Iraqi forces. Mr. Cheney would later say that he was acting out of
"curiosity" and for the sake of "comprehensiveness." The study was
immediately destroyed.5

Serious Consideration of Nuclear Use

We are left then with three cases where the use of nuclear weapons seems
to have been very seriously considered: the Korean War, the two Formosa
Strait crises in the 1950s, and of course the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Korea and Formosa

As soon as the Korean War began, President Truman ordered the
preparation of attack plans in case the Soviet Union was to enter the
fray.60 He sent B29 nuclear bombers twice in the region, in 1950 and
1951---the second time with several assembled weapons. However, in June
1951, a Joint Staff study threw cold water on these plans by concluding
an absence of "good" targets for nuclear use.

The use of nuclear weapons was also seriously discussed several times at
the beginning of the Eisenhower administration, between February and May
1953.62 One contingency plan involved the large-scale tactical and
strategic (on Chinese territory) use of nuclear weapons.63 On May 20,
the U.S. president secretly approved this option in the form of a
memorandum entitled "NSC Action 794" to be executed if circumstances
warranted a resumption of offensive action---which never came, since the
Armistice was signed in July.64 As described by Columbia University
professor Richard Betts, "NSC Action 794 was not a commitment, but it
was as close to a final decision as a president can come, short of the
moment of execution." 65 Nobody knows what Eisenhower would have decided
had fighting erupted again.

In any event, several reasons prevented the use of nuclear weapons
during the Korean War.66 As documented, inter alia, by Nina Tannenwald
and T.V. Paul, both presidents appeared seriously concerned with the
international reputation of the United States.67 And in almost all
scenarios, the use of nuclear weapons did not offer any prospect to make
a serious difference on the ground.

During the Formosa Strait (also known as the Taiwan Strait) crises of
1954-- 1955 as well as 1958, nuclear use was seriously considered in
case of an invasion of Taiwan.69 But that was to come only as a last
resort, for fear of allied reactions or Soviet escalation. Eisenhower
was prepared but not "anxious" to use nuclear weapons.70 Despite his
public positions on the subject, a U.S. Air Force report made clear that
"the President simply did not accept the contention that nuclear weapons
were as conventional as high explosives."

The Cuban Missile Crisis seems to remain the only moment since 1945 when
the world came really close to nuclear use. This refers less to the
retaliatory threat that President Kennedy publicly made in case a
missile was launched against the Americas,72 instead referring more to
three specific episodes about which the details only became public in
the 1990s.

First, on October 24, 1962, the U.S. Navy attempted to force a B29
Soviet submarine to surface. The U.S. crew was unable to reach the
general staff.73 An "exhausted" and "furious" Soviet captain Vassili
Savitsky considered putting the ship's 15-kiloton nuclear torpedo in
operational condition. He told his crew: "We're going to blast them now!
We will die, but we will sink them all---we will not disgrace our Navy."
74 The traditional account holds that only the fortuitous presence in
the submarine of the fleet commander, Vassili Arkhipov, prevented the
shot, since he voted against it. But this version is questionable.
According to the Soviet Navy rules, the circumstances for allowing the
torpedo strike were not met: written rules of engagement stated that it
was possible only on Moscow's orders.75 Also, it is by no means certain
that any real vote took place. [The commander "consulted" Arkhipov and
deputy political officer Ivan Maslennikov---and they were both opposed.
Viktor Mikhailov, an officer on board, testified that "**Savitski never
lost it**."]{.underline}

In the second episode, on October 27 at the height of the crisis, U.S.
radars in Alaska detected two Soviet MiG-19s attempting to intercept a
U.S. U2 reconnaissance plane, which was flying towards the Kola
Peninsula due to a navigation error. Two U.S. F-102s took off to
accompany the plane, armed with Falcon nuclear air to-air missiles.
However, Khrushchev declared in his memoirs that the Soviet Union would
not have intercepted the plane under such circumstances (even less with
nuclear missiles) before ascertaining that it was not a navigation
error.

In the third episode, Soviet forces in Cuba were endowed with theater
nuclear weapons, and rules of engagement initially allowed them to be
used in case of an invasion if no contact with Moscow was possible.
However, Khrushchev took the initiative on October 26 to alter those
rules as to ensure that a Kremlin order would be a prerequisite.

[The Tradition of Non-Use Is Strong]{.underline}

The Cuban crisis reveals that Soviet and U.S. officials were able to
refrain from foolish judgments even in conditions of extreme stress.
Adversaries have never put at stake the "vital interests" of their
opponents---either because they were unable to, or because they never
intended to, or simply because they feared retaliation. [The barriers to
the use of nuclear weapons were solid, and the "tradition of non-use"
emerged very quickly.]{.underline}

One last element of the anti-nuclear narrative deserves discussion.
There is no certainty at all that any use of a nuclear weapon would turn
into a major nuclear war. Yes, Cuba was a time of great danger. [But why
would the use of a nuclear torpedo]{.underline}, for instance,
[necessarily have led to a global thermonuclear exchange? **Is it** not
at least **equally likely** that **the two countries would** have done
their best to **limit escalation**?]{.underline} It is possible, as
Herman Kahn famously argued, that "[**the nuclear threshold is not so
weak** that **a single use** of nuclear weapons **would make anyone
careless** about crossing it a second time]{.underline}."

Escalation in the nuclear age would not necessarily be a descent into
the abyss. It might very well be the equivalent of walking up a
staircase where the last stairs are considerably higher than the first
ones. Resistance to actual use or launch could increase as one moves up
the escalation ladder---not unlike two magnets repelling each other.

[**The narrative** claiming that **the world has stood** many times
"**on the brink of apocalypse**]{.underline}," or that we were within a
"hair's breadth" of a nuclear catastrophe, thus [deserves
deconstruction]{.underline}. [It **discards** the strength of the
**technical, operational, or mental safety valves** that prevent nuclear
use]{.underline}. Stanislas Petrov, the "man who saved the world," was
not a superhero who single-handedly stopped a runaway train: he was an
average Soviet official who applied procedures.

Some legitimate questions remain. What would happen if a false alarm
erupted during wartime? If a full-blown conflict involving nuclear-armed
countries erupted---something that has never happened, probably thanks
to deterrence---can we assume that caution would still prevail? This is
an important question and a legitimate preoccupation. The absence of any
such conflict since 1945 suggests that nuclear deterrence is a robust
construct---but no human construct is infallible. Whether it is for
safety mechanisms or for deterrence, even "virtually impossible" does
not mean zero. Some would argue that any probability of a nuclear war is
too much. But surely this does not close the discussion: a very small
probability of a deadly car accident has to be balanced against the
benefits of driving to work, for instance. Is the nuclear system
"tolerably safe"? 80 The conversation between proponents of deterrence
and anti-nuclear activists should revolve around the costs and benefits
equation. It is also far from certain that such safety mechanisms and
human resistance will always be present in the decision-making complexes
of all nuclear-armed states (think North Korea or Pakistan, for
instance).

[There's been a lot of discussion lately about the risks posed by
hackers to America's critical infrastructure systems, with terms like
"cyber-Pearl Harbor" and "cyber-9/11"]{.underline} being bandied about
by government officials and other prominent figures.¶ Invariably, [one
of the worst scenarios often depicted by these cyberwar predictions is
an attack on the US power grid that would cause a widespread
blackout.]{.underline}¶ In his testimony before the House Intelligence
Committee on November 20th, NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers went into
some detail on those risks:¶ House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike
Rogers: ["It was determined that malware was on those (critical
infrastructure) systems. Can you be a little more definitive about what
does that mean? If I'm on that system and I want to do some harm, what
does that do ... ? Do the lights go out? Do we stop pumping water? What
does that really mean? And the fact that it was there]{.underline},
**[does that mean they already have the capability to 'flip the switch'
if they wanted to?"]{.underline}¶** Admiral Michael Rogers: "Well let me
address the last part first. [There shouldn't be any doubt in our minds
that there are nation-states and groups out there that have the
capability to do that]{.underline}. To enter our systems, to enter those
industrial control systems, and to shut down, forestall our ability to
operate, our basic infrastructure. Whether it's generating power across
this nation, whether it's moving water and fuel ... Once you're into the
system and you're able to do that, it enables you to do things like, if
I want to tell power turbines to go offline and stop generating power,
you can do that. If I wanted to segment the transmission system so that
you couldn't distribute the power that was coming out of the power
stations, this would enable you to do that. It enables you to shut down
very segmented, very tailored parts of our infrastructure."¶ [A number
of media outlets interpreted these comments as a claim by the NSA that a
country like China could take down our nation's power grid. But is that
what the NSA director really said? And is a widespread, national
blackout caused by hackers a realistic scenario?¶]{.underline} While
it's easy to draw that conclusion from the generalized nature of Adm.
Rogers' responses, it's important to re-read the last line in that
exchange: "It enables you to shut down very segmented, very tailored
parts of our infrastructure." (Emphasis added.)¶ This line is important
because it clarifies the types of risks we're actually talking about
when it comes to the electric grid. [**No**, hackers can't take down the
entire, or even a widespread portion of the US electric
grid]{.underline}. From a logistical standpoint, [this would be **far
too difficult** to realistically pull off]{.underline} - and it's not
what we should be devoting our attention to. What is more realistic is
for a cyber attack to ~~cripple~~ \[devastate\] an individual utility,
causing a blackout or disruption of service at the local level.¶ The
power grid is vulnerable to attack --- there's no question about that.
In my own work, testing the security readiness of US and global energy
companies and utilities, I regularly find serious vulnerabilities on
these networks and I am often called in to deal with compromises that
have already taken place --- including cyber-espionage activities by
state-sponsored groups.¶ Adm. Rogers testimony is extremely important as
it provides a strong authoritative voice to what is an urgent problem
facing this country right now: America's critical infrastructure is
vulnerable to attack, it's a complicated problem to fix it and an attack
is eminent. But the notion that a hacker could basically turn off the
country's power with the 'flip of a switch,' as Rep. Rogers called it,
is more science fiction than reality.¶ Here's why:¶ [The US energy grid
is owned and operated by hundreds of various regional utilities that all
use different hardware and software. That means hackers would have to
tunnel into hundreds of diverse networks, which would take several
years, and then write custom exploits which are unique for each specific
environment they're targeting]{.underline}. [For those who would argue
that China]{.underline} or Russia [have the money]{.underline}, time and
capability to do that, [try to understand that developing a functional
exploit, getting it placed on the exact part of the network that it
needs to be on in order to have the desired effect]{.underline} (i.e.,
specific programmable logic controllers that run the utility's
machinery), [then keeping it hidden on that network over a period of
months or years while security teams try to hunt it down, and doing all
of this at the same time on hundreds of networks is extremely
difficult]{.underline}. [To put it in perspective, **it would be like
trying to rob a hundred different banks at the exact same
time.**]{.underline}¶ However, [even if a hacker group was able to pull
this off, there is a catch-all that would create yet another hurdle.
**There are high-voltage DC interconnects at various points that were
specifically designed to prevent widespread outages.**]{.underline}**¶**
By clarifying what we mean when we warn about attacks on the electric
grid and other critical infrastructure, I'm not trying to downplay this
risk at all. US critical infrastructure networks, which include the
electric grid, utilities, oil/gas refineries and pipelines, water
treatment plants, transportation networks, etc., are all highly
vulnerable to cyber attacks, and this threat should be prioritized at
the highest level by the federal government.¶ In the meantime, the
individual asset owners who are the ones technically responsible for
securing their networks and facilities need to start taking more
aggressive steps immediately to guard against highly sophisticated cyber
actors. [But the real risk when it comes to the electric grid
specifically is of localized disruptions in service --- not a widespread
outage. It would be extremely difficult for hackers, without an almost
superhuman effort, to cause a power outage that stretched across the
country.]{.underline}

\"Forget hackers: Squirrels are a bigger threat to America\'s power
grid\"
theweek.com/articles/452311/forget-hackers-squirrels-are-bigger-threat-americas-power-grid

[While American lawmakers and security officials repeatedly warn of a
catastrophic cyberattack that will ~~cripple~~ \[devastate\] the
nation\'s power grids, in reality, squirrels and tree branches are
proving more troublesome than hackers when it comes to actual power
outages.¶]{.underline} According to numerous reports and headlines:
America\'s power grid is \"too vulnerable to cyberattack;\" thousands
will die if terrorists attack the grid; cyber attacks could keep America
in the dark for nine to 18 months; and electric companies face \"daily\"
cyber attacks, which over a month can build to 10,000.¶ [With cyber
security so abysmal, incentive so high, and attacks constant, why
hasn\'t there been a massive hacker-triggered power failure yet? Simply
put, because **it\'s not that easy.**¶]{.underline} To be clear, attacks
on the power grid would be disastrous and there are significant gaps
that must be addressed --- procedures improved, vulnerabilities patched,
software updated --- but even with these glaring weaknesses, [an
ordinary hacker wouldn\'t be able to take down the electrical grid.
Turning America\'s lights off remotely is a complex operation that
requires not only hacking expertise but an array of intelligence and
analysis]{.underline} --- something only the most sophisticated
terrorist organizations or nation states can muster.¶ [Take one of the
grid\'s greatest cyber vulnerabilities, SCADA]{.underline} (supervisory
control and data acquisition) software. It allows utility companies to
remotely monitor and control facilities, which has the unfortunate
consequence of also [giving hackers the ability to sabotage the grid
from afar.¶]{.underline} While terrifying in theory, cyber security
expert Bruce Schneier explains that [SCADA vulnerabilities are
\"overblown\" and the reports are \"hype.\"]{.underline} [Actually
hacking into SCADA software and causing physical damage to a system is
exceptionally difficult]{.underline}. In fact, the only known SCADA
attack to cause damage was the Stuxnet virus, which was created after
years of intensive research and espionage by Israel and America\'s most
advanced spies and engineers to damage a secret Iranian nuclear
facility.¶ Veteran intelligence officer Michael Tanji points out in
Wired just how complex such an attack would be. For starters [SCADA
systems are \"rarely connected directly to the public internet,\" which
makes \"gaining access to grid-controlling networks a challenge for all
but the most dedicated, motivated and skilled --- nation-states, in
other words.\"¶ If hackers were somehow able to enter the system, to
actually cause physical damage Tanji explains, they would still need to
have **advanced intelligence gathering** abilities to learn which SCADA
software utilities are running, how they are connected, what the
generator blueprints look like, which weaknesses exist in equipment, how
to exploit those weaknesses, which machines are linked, how to override
safety mechanisms and keep engineers or automatic safeguards from
stepping in, and much more.¶]{.underline} In other words, [\"a purely
online approach is simply not going to provide you with the type and
volume of information you are going to need to accomplish your
mission,\"]{.underline} Tanji said. \"You\'re going to have to deploy
national-level resources.\"¶ Meanwhile, as lawmakers worry over these
highly sophisticated hypothetical attacks, the nation\'s aging power
grid is falling apart all by itself.¶ In its annual report on US
infrastructure, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the
electric grid, some of which dates back to the 1880s, a \"D-plus\" as
the number of power failures continues to rise.¶ [According to a study
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, between 1965
and 1988, there were three major power failures. From 2000 to 2005,
there were 11 and from 2006 to 2009, there were 33. **The primary
cause** of these failures **was weather.**¶]{.underline} More troubling
is the fact that [the second largest blackout]{.underline} in history,
the 2003 Northeast blackout that left more than 50 million without power
for two days, **[was caused by power lines brushing against tree
branches in Ohio.]{.underline}**¶ [Even **squirrels** are proving to be,
well, a squirrelly problem. No one really knows how much damage the
rodents do, but **it\'s certainly more than hackers
manage**]{.underline}. A cursory analysis in The New York Times found
that over a four month span last year, [squirrels caused at least **50**
power outages]{.underline} across the country --- and those were just
the ones that made the news. And while no one knows how many people are
affected by squirrel-related outages each year, in just two days last
June, four squirrel-related incidents left more than 18,000 homes in
four different states in the dark. How do squirrels manage such mayhem?
[They simply chew through wires or scamper over fragile electrical
equipment.]{.underline}¶ If squirrels weren\'t troublesome enough, on
the more malicious end, [there has been a sharp increase in the number
of physical attacks]{.underline} on America\'s energy infrastructure and
authorities are struggling to find who\'s responsible.¶ Last year,
[Arkansas suffered three separate attacks]{.underline} on the electrical
grid that left thousands without power including a substation being lit
on fire, [the chopping down of two key utility poles with a stolen
tractor]{.underline}, and an attempt to use a train to pull down a
100-foot transmission tower.¶ [Meanwhile in California, an individual
entered a substation and cut several cables, knocking out 911 calls,
landlines, and cell service in the area before firing a high-powered
rifle at transformers, which ultimately shut down the transformer
bank.¶]{.underline} Military-grade hackers could certainly trigger a
blackout for the ages, but with saboteurs waltzing into power stations
and causing mayhem with impunity, tree branches leaving millions in the
dark, and squirrels wrecking havoc, there are more clear and present
dangers to worry about.

**It is impossible for hackers to perform a large scale attack on the US
power grid.**

[The specter of a large-scale, destructive attack on the U.S. power grid
is at the center of much strategic thinking about
cybersecurity.]{.underline} For years, Americans have been warned by a
bevy of would-be Cassandras in Congress, the administration and the
press that hackers are poised to shut it down. But in fact, the
half-dozen [security experts]{.underline} interviewed for this article
[agree]{.underline}d [it's virtually impossible for an online-only
attack to cause a widespread or prolonged outage of the North American
power grid]{.underline}. Even laying the groundwork for such a cyber
operation could qualify as an act of war against the U.S. --- a line
that few nation-state-backed hacker crews would wish to cross. [None
denied that determined hackers could penetrate the networks of bulk
power providers. But there's a huge gap between that and causing a
civilization-ending sustained outage of the grid. Electrical-grid
hacking scenarios mostly overlook the engineering expertise necessary to
intentionally cause harm to the grid]{.underline}, [say experts
knowledgeable about the power generators and high voltage transmission
entities that constitute the backbone of the grid]{.underline} ---
[what's called the bulk power system.]{.underline} [There's also the
enormity of the grid and diversity of its equipment]{.underline} to
consider. "[The grid is designed to lose utilities all the
time]{.underline}," said Patrick Miller, founder and director of the
Energy Sector Security Consortium. "I'm not trying to trivialize the
situation, but [you're not really able to cause this nationwide
cascading failure for any extended duration of time,"]{.underline} he
added. "[**It's just not possible**."]{.underline}

The [risks]{.underline} of nuclear power [are many]{.underline}, but
[two stand above]{.underline} the rest. [The first is]{.underline} that
the [fuel assemblies]{.underline} in the reactor [might
overheat]{.underline}. [That would only occur if the fission process
became uncontrolled]{.underline} or if the cooling system failed. Should
overheating occur, the fuel rods' zirconium cladding and nuclear
materials could both melt, resulting in a nuclear sludge akin to molten
lava. That slag would be so hot that it might melt through the bottom of
the reinforced reactor. Eventually, it would cool enough to harden, but
not before it had spewed nuclear contaminants into the air. Melting
zirconium also releases hydrogen, which could lead to an explosion that
might actually expel the nuclear material into the surrounding
area---think Fukushima. [The good news is that nuclear fission can be
stopped in **under one second**]{.underline} [through the insertion of
control rods]{.underline}. [Those]{.underline} control rods [are
**automatically inserted**]{.underline} near the fuel rods either by a
hydraulic system or through the use of an electromagnetic deadman switch
that activates when power is removed. [That means that when the
electrical grid goes down]{.underline} or an emergency shutdown is
initiated, **[fission would automatically stop one second
later]{.underline}**. [That's a good thing]{.underline}, [but it doesn't
make the reactor inherently safe. Even without fission]{.underline}, the
fuel rod [assemblies remain]{.underline} incredibly h[o]{.underline}t,
perhaps a thousand degrees C. [If they were not actively
cooled]{.underline}, pressure and [temperatures would build]{.underline}
in the reactor until something breaks---not good. [After three days of
active cooling]{.underline}, [however, the reactor would be thermally
**cool enough to open**]{.underline}, should it be deemed necessary to
remove the fuel rod assemblies. [The second]{.underline} major
[risk]{.underline} [has to do with]{.underline} cooling of the [spent
fuel]{.underline} rod assemblies. Nuclear fuel rod assemblies have a
usable life on the order of 54-72 months (depending on reactor type).
Every 18-24 months, the reactor is brought down and serviced. While it
is down, the fuel rod assemblies are removed, and 1/3 of them are
replaced with fresh assemblies. Think of this like rotating cans of food
in your emergency pantry. In the U.S., fuel rods are not refurbished
like in other countries. Instead, they are carefully stored in giant
pools of water laced with boric acid---imagine a swimming pool at your
local YMCA that is 75-feet deep. Those spent fuel rod assemblies are
still incredibly radioactive, and they continue to generate heat. Water
in the pool must therefore be circulated to keep them cool. How long
must the fuel rods be cooled? According to Mr. Hopson, the answer is 5-7
years. After that, the rods are cool enough to be removed and stored in
reinforced concrete casks. Even then, the rods continue to be
radioactive, but their heat output can be passively managed. Nuclear
[plants]{.underline} obviously [require electricity to
operate]{.underline} their [cooling pumps]{.underline}, not to mention
their control systems. That power is normally tapped off of the
electricity that the reactor generates. If the plant is offline, the
power is provided by the electrical grid. But [what happens when the
grid]{.underline} itself [goes down? The]{.underline} [short answer
is]{.underline} that large [on-site diesel generators **automatically
activate**]{.underline} to provide electricity. [And if those should
fail]{.underline}, [portable diesel generators, which are **also
on-site**,]{.underline} can be connected. [Recent **standardization**
has also ensured that generators can be swapped between plants without
the need to retrofit connectors. There are]{.underline} also a couple of
[additional emergency]{.underline} systems [that can be used
specifically to cool the reactor]{.underline}. [These include the
turbine-driven-auxiliary-feedwater pump, which uses steam generated by
the reactor to power a cooling turbine]{.underline}. [The pump requires
an operator]{.underline}, [but it runs **completely without
electricity**]{.underline}. This system, however, is meant only for
emergency cooling of the reactor during those critical first few days
when the fuel rod assemblies are being brought down in temperature, not
for long-term cooling. And finally, **[in the worst case]{.underline}**,
[most plants have a method of bringing in river or ocean water to
**flood the reactor**.]{.underline} [This typically damages the cooling
system, but again, it helps to cool and cover the reactor core should
all else fail]{.underline}. Unlike in other countries, [permission from
the federal government is not required to flood the reactor. With
**backup systems to the backup systems**]{.underline}, [it would seem
that there's nothing to worry about]{.underline}, right? Under all but
the direst of circumstances, I think that assessment is correct.
However, [one could imagine a scenario in which the grid]{.underline}
[was lost and the diesel generators ran out of fuel]{.underline}.
Speaking of fuel, how much is actually stored onsite? It depends on the
plant, but at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, for example, [there is enough
fuel to run the emergency diesel generators for **at least 42
days.**]{.underline} I say at least because it would depend on exactly
what was being powered. [Once the reactor was cooled down,]{.underline}
a [much smaller system, known as the Residual Heat Removal System, would
be all that was required to keep the fuel assemblies cool,]{.underline}
both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. The
[generators]{.underline} and onsite fuel supply [could power that
smaller cooling system for **significantly longer**]{.underline} [than
if they were powering the larger reactor cooling system.]{.underline}
**[Even if we assumed a worst case]{.underline}** of forty-two days,
[it's hard to imagine a scenario in which that would not be enough time
to bring in additional fuel either by land, water, or air]{.underline}.
[Nonetheless, let's push the question]{.underline} a little further.
What would happen in the unlikely event that the diesel fuel was
exhausted? [Even with the reactor]{.underline} having been successfully
[cooled]{.underline}, [the biggest risk would continue to be
overheating]{.underline} of the fuel rod assemblies, both in the reactor
and the spent fuel rods pool. Without circulation, the heat from the
fuel rod assemblies could boil the surrounding water, resulting in
steam. In turn, the water levels would drop, ultimately exposing the
fuel rods to air. [Once exposed to air, their temperatures would
rise]{.underline} [but not to the levels that would melt the zirconium
cladding.]{.underline} [Thankfully, that means that meltdown **would not
occur**]{.underline}. The [steam might well carry radioactive
contaminants]{.underline} into the air, [but there would be no release
of hydrogen]{.underline} [and, thus, **no subsequent
explosions**]{.underline}. [The situation would certainly be dangerous
to surrounding communities, but it **wouldn't be the nuclear Armageddon
that many people worry about.**]{.underline}

Not only was the discussion enlightening about the reasons why different
people end up with different opinions about climate change responses
when presented with essentially the same body of information, but it
also got me thinking about a possible way to fight back against the
Gundersens, Caldicotts, Riccios, Grossmans and Wassermans of the world.
[That group]{.underline} of five [tend to use apocalyptic rhetoric to
describe what will happen to the world if we do not immediately start
turning our]{.underline} collective [backs on]{.underline} all of the
benefits that abundant [atomic energy]{.underline} can provide. They
spin tall tales of deformed children, massive numbers of cancers as a
result of minor radioactive material releases, swaths of land made
"uninhabitable" for thousands of years, countries "cut in half", and
clouds of "hot particles" raining death and destruction ten thousand
miles from the release point. [Every one of those clowns have been
repeating similar stories for at least two solid decades, and continue
to repeat their stories even after]{.underline} supposedly catastrophic
failures at [Fukushima have not resulted in a single radiation related
injury or death]{.underline}. According to eminent scientists -- like
Dr. Robert Gale -- [Fukushima is unlikely to EVER result in any
measurable increase in radiation related illness.]{.underline} One
important element that we have to consider to assess cancer risks
associated with an accident like Fukushima is our baseline risk for
developing cancer. All of us, unfortunately, have a substantial risk of
developing cancer in our lifetime. For example, a 50-year-old male has a
42% risk of developing cancer during his remaining life; it's almost the
same for a 10-year-old. This risk only decreases when we get much older
and only because we are dying of other causes. It's true that excess
radiation exposure can increase our cancer risk above baseline levels;
it's clear from studies of the survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, of people exposed to radiation in medical and
occupational settings, and of people exposed to radon decay products in
mines and home basements. When it comes to exposures like that of
Fukushima, the question is: What is the relative magnitude of the
increased risk from Fukushima compared to our baseline cancer risk?
Despite our fears, it is quite small. If the nuclear industry -- as
small and unfocused as it is -- really wanted to take action to isolate
the apocalyptic antinuclear activists, it could take a page from the
effective campaign of the fossil fuel lobby. It could start an
integrated campaign to help the rest of us to remember that, despite the
dire predictions, the sky never fell, the predicted unnatural deaths
never occurred, the deformations were figments of imagination, and the
land is not really irreversibly uninhabitable for generations. The
industry would effectively share the story of Ukraine's recent decision
to begin repopulating the vast majority of the "dead zone" that was
forcibly evacuated after the Chernobyl accident. It would put some
context into the discussion about radiation health effects; even if
leaders shy away from directly challenging the Linear No Threshold (LNT)
dose assumption, they can still show that even that pessimistic model
says that a tiny dose leads to a tiny risk. Aside: My personal opinion
is that the LNT is scientifically unsupportable and should be replaced
with a much better model. We deserve far less onerous regulations; there
is evidence that existing regulations actually cause harm. I hear a
rumor that there is a group of mostly retired, but solidly credentialed
professionals who are organizing a special session at the annual ANS
meeting to talk about effective ways to influence policy changes. End
Aside. Most of us recognize that there is no such thing as a zero risk;
repeated assertions of "there is no safe level" should be addressed by
accepting "close enough" to zero so that even the most fearful person
can stop worrying. [The sky has not fallen, even though we have
experienced complete core meltdowns and]{.underline} secondary
[explosions that did some]{.underline} visible [damage]{.underline}.
Nuclear plants are not perfect, there will be accidents and there will
be radioactive material releases. [History is telling me that the risks
are acceptable]{.underline}, especially in the context of the real world
where there is always some potential for harm. The benefits of accepting
a little nuclear risk are immense and must not be marginalized by the
people who market fear and trembling.

declared, "They are getting stronger all the time . . . And their goal .

has been a very excitable press. On CNN last week, I was asked if
Islamic State fighters represented an "existential threat" to the United
States. Set aside that absurdity; **[no terrorist group threatens our

modern times --- the Soviet nuclear arsenal --- and that is it.) [But is
the **I**slamic **S**tate a huge and menacing terrorist threat?
**Certainly not to the United States today.**]{.underline} The danger to
Iraq and its neighbors is real. The Islamic State has shown itself to be
a formidable insurgency. Its focus is on ripping apart Iraq and Syria,
sowing sectarian conflict, and creating in its midst a new jihadist
state or caliphate. (That very word seems to incite fearmongers: "Every
day that goes by, ISIS builds up its caliphate, and it becomes a direct
threat to the United States," said New York Representative Peter King,

If the insurgency grows, and the threat to Jordan or Lebanon increases,
we may have to act. But, for now, [it's important to understand that

of Al Qaeda in Iraq, operatives carried out hotel bombings in Jordan and
tried and failed to attack an American warship in the Red Sea. More
recently, four people were killed in an apparent lone-wolf attack at the
Jewish museum in Brussels by a young man trained in Syria. In other
words, we've seen no demonstrated ability to carry out the kind of
complex international strike that kills dozens or hundreds, [let alone
engulfs a US city in flames.]{.underline}

"Doubting Deterrence of Nuclear Terrorism,"
http://csis.org/blog/doubting-deterrence-nuclear-terrorism\]

Because of the difficulty of deterring transnational actors, many
deterrence advocates shift the focus to deterring state sponsors of
nuclear terrorism. The argument applies whether or not the state
intended to assist nuclear terrorists. If terrorists obtain a nuclear
weapon or fissile materials from a state, [the theory goes, then the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will track the weapon's
country of origin using nuclear forensics, and retaliate against that
country]{.underline}. If this is U.S. policy, advocates predict that
[states will be deterred from assisting terrorists with their nuclear
ambitions]{.underline}. Yet, [let's think about the series of events
that would play out if a terrorist organization detonated a weapon in
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Let's assume forensics
confirmed the weapon's origin,]{.underline} and let's assume, for
argument's sake, that country was Pakistan. [Would the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [then retaliate with a nuclear
strike?]{.underline} If a nuclear attack occurs within the next four
years (a reasonable length of time for such predictions concerning
current international and domestic politics), **[it seems unlikely.
Why?]{.underline}** First, [there's the problem of time.]{.underline}
[Though nuclear forensics is useful, it takes time to analyze the data
and determine the country of origin. Any justified response upon a state
sponsor would not be swift.]{.underline} Second, [**even if** the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [proved the country of origin,
it would then be difficult to determine that Pakistan willingly and
intentionally sponsored nuclear terrorism.]{.underline} If Pakistan did,
then nuclear retaliation might be justified. However, [if Pakistan did
not, nuclear retaliation over unsecured nuclear materials would be a
disproportionate response and]{.underline} potentially [further
detrimental]{.underline}. Should the United States launch a nuclear
strike at Pakistan, Islamabad could see this as an initial hostility by
the United States, and respond adversely. An obvious choice, given
current tensions in South Asia, is for Pakistan to retaliate against a
U.S. nuclear launch on its territory by initiating conflict with India,
which could turn nuclear and increase the exchanges of nuclear weapons.
Hence, [it seems more likely that, after the international outrage at a
terrorist group's nuclear detonation, the United States would attempt to
stop the bleeding **without a nuclear strike**]{.underline}. Instead,
[some choices might include deploying forces to track down those that
supported the suicide terrorists that detonated the weapon, pressuring
Pakistan to exert its sovereignty over fringe regions such as the
F]{.underline}ederally [A]{.underline}dministered [T]{.underline}ribal
[A]{.underline}reas, [and increasing the number of drone strikes in
Waziristan. Given the initial attack, such measures might understandably
seem more of a concession than the retaliation called for by deterrence
models, even more so by the American public]{.underline}. This is not an
argument against those technologies associated with nuclear forensics.
The United States and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should
continue their development and distribution. Instead, I [question the
presumed American response that is promulgated by deterrence
advocates]{.underline}. By [looking at possibilities for a U.S. response
to nuclear terrorism, a situation in which we assume that deterrence has
failed, we **cast doubt on the likelihood of a U.S. retaliatory nuclear
strike** and hence cast doubt on the credibility of a U.S. retaliatory
nuclear strike as a deterrent]{.underline}. Would the United States
launch a nuclear weapon now unless it was sure of another state's
intentional sponsorship of nuclear terrorism? **[Any reasonable
doubt]{.underline}** of sponsorship [might stay the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [nuclear hand. Given the opaqueness of countries'
intentions, reasonable doubt over sponsorship **is inevitable** to some
degree. Other countries are probably **aware of U.S.
hesitance**]{.underline} in response to terrorists' use of nuclear
weapons. If this thought experiment is true, then the communication
required for credible retaliatory strikes under deterrence of nuclear
terrorism is missing.

However, there is of course no guarantee that things will remain that
way, and the [9/11 attacks inspired the **remarkable extrapolation**
that, because the **terrorists were successful with box cutters**, they
might soon be able to **turn out** **w**eapons of **m**ass
**d**estruction--- particularly **nuclear ones**]{.underline}---[and
then detonate them]{.underline} in an American city. For example, in his
influential 2004 book, Nuclear Terrorism, Harvard's Graham [**Allison**
relayed his "considered judgment" that "on the current path, a nuclear
terrorist attack on America in the decade ahead is more likely than
not.]{.underline}"11 Allison has had a great deal of company in his
alarming pronouncements. In 2007, the distinguished physicist Richard
Garwin put the likelihood of a nuclear explosion on an American or
European city by terrorist or other means at 20 percent per year, which
would work out to 91 percent over the eleven-year period to 2018.12
**[Allison's time is up]{.underline}**, and so is Garwin's. These
[**off-repeated warnings** have **proven** to be **empty**]{.underline}.
And it is important to point out that [**not only** have terrorists
**failed to go nuclear**]{.underline}, but as William Langewiesche, who
has assessed the process in detail, put it in 2007, "[The best
information is that **no one has gotten anywhere near
this**]{.underline}. I mean, if [you look carefully and practically at
this process, you see that it is an **enormous undertaking** **full of
risks for** the would-be **terrorists**]{.underline}."13 [That process
requires **trusting corrupted** foreign **collaborators** and **other
criminals**, **obtaining** and **transporting** **highly guarded
material**, setting up a **machine shop** staffed with **top scientists
and technicians**, and rolling the **heavy**, **cumbersome**, and
**untested** finished **product** into position to be **detonated** by a
**skilled crew**, all the while **attracting no attention** from
outsiders]{.underline}. [Nor have terrorist groups been able to steal
existing nuclear weapons---characteristically burdened with **multiple
safety devices** and often **stored in pieces** at **separate secure
locales**]{.underline}---from existing arsenals as was once much feared.
And [they certainly **have not been able** to **cajole leaders** in
nuclear states to palm one off to them]{.underline}---though a war
inflicting more death than Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined was launched
against Iraq in 2003 in major part under the spell of fantasies about
such a handover.14 More generally, [the actual terrorist "adversaries"
in the West scarcely deserve accolades for either dedication or
prowess]{.underline}. It is true, of course, that sometimes even
incompetents can get lucky, but such instances, however tragic, are
rare. [For the most part, terrorists in the United States are a
**confused**, **inadequate**, **incompetent**, **blundering**, and
**gullible bunch**, only **occasionally able to get their act
together**]{.underline}. [Most seem to be far **better** at frenetic and
often **self-deluded scheming** than at actual
**execution**]{.underline}. A summary assessment by RAND's Brian Jenkins
is apt: "[their numbers remain small, their determination limp, and
their competence poor]{.underline}."15 And much [the same holds for
Europe and the rest of the developed world]{.underline}.16 Also working
against terrorist success in the West is the fact that almost all are
amateurs: [they have never before tried to do something like
this]{.underline}. Unlike criminals they have not been able to develop
street smarts. Except perhaps for the use of vehicles to deliver mayhem
(though this idea is by no means new in the history of terrorism),
[there has been remarkably **little innovation** in **terrorist
weaponry** or methodology since 9/11]{.underline}.17 Like their
predecessors, [they have continue]{.underline}d [to rely on
**bombs**]{.underline} ([many of which **fail to detonate**]{.underline}
or do much damage) [and bullets]{.underline}.18

**No US-Iran war -- [mutual disincentives]{.underline} and
[empirics]{.underline} -- rhetoric doesn't matter.**

**Tabatabai '17** (Adnan Tabatabai is co-founder and CEO of the Center
for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient, "Why Iran-US war of
words won\'t turn physical", Al-Monitor, February 9, 2017,

accessed 6/29/2017,)

As much as the United States\' new tone toward Iran is worrisome, and as
much as the Islamic Republic\'s Jan. 29 ballistic missile test is
disconcerting, **[Tehran and Washington are unlikely to
collide]{.underline}** directly. [In both capitals, decision-makers see
an urgent need for harsh rhetoric]{.underline} --- albeit for different
reasons. [The Iranians see a need to show resilience vis-a-vis an
explicitly hostile US administration]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the
latter wants to make clear to both its domestic and international
audience that the Obama era is over]{.underline}. This involves
signaling that the easing of tensions with Iran has ended. It also
involves reassuring regional allies such as Saudi Arabia and Israel that
Washington would not engage in a rapprochement with Tehran at their
expense. Indeed, it should not come as a surprise that US national
security adviser Michael Flynn\'s warning that Iran \"is officially on
notice\" came shortly after lengthy phone calls between the White House
and both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia\'s
King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. [**But escalating rhetoric aside,
the reality is that US policy toward Iran has largely remained intact.**
In the 13 months since the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran has repeatedly conducted ballistic missile
tests.]{.underline} And it is entitled to do so. In UN Security Council
Resolution (UNSCR) 2231, which endorses the nuclear deal, Iran is
\"called upon\" not to carry out tests of missiles \"designed\" to carry
nuclear weapons. There is no legally binding prohibition of such
launches, unlike in UNSCR 1929 --- the last and most harsh UN resolution
against Iran over its nuclear program --- which is superseded by UNSCR
2231. [To be clear, the nuclear deal does not address Iran\'s missile
program. Moreover, the world powers with which Iran negotiated UNSCR
2231 --- apart from the United States --- did not display any appetite
to insert legally binding text on Iran\'s missile tests]{.underline}.
Thus, [as provocative as the missile tests may be, it is hard to see
them providing a legal basis for the United States to spearhead new
multilateral sanctions]{.underline}, leaving Washington with the option
of adopting unilateral sanctions, which it did on Feb. 3. While it took
the Trump administration less than two weeks to slap sanctions on Iran,
the idea that there was a sanctions freeze in Obama\'s final year in
office is inaccurate. In fact, the latest sanctions were prepared by the
previous administration. In January 2016, not long after the
implementation of the nuclear deal, changes were made to the Visa Waiver
Program, which excluded Iranian dual nationals and anyone who had
visited Iran in the preceding five years. Moreover, last December, Obama
refrained from moving to veto the congressional vote on a 10-year
extension of the Iran Sanctions Act. While these sanctions are unrelated
to Iran\'s nuclear program, they undoubtedly undermine the impact of the
lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. [Iran has reacted to the
escalating rhetoric and sanctions by stressing that its missile program
is defensive in nature, promising retaliatory sanctions, and by carrying
out new military drills. **Yet, there is little incentive for Iran to
greatly alter the status quo**. Iranian leaders see the JCPOA as much
more than just about the United States]{.underline}. It is an
international arrangement with world powers --- including the European
Union, which Iran holds in high regard as a multinational institution.
[They see this arrangement as beneficial to Iran\'s economic and
security calculations]{.underline}. Foreign investment, albeit limited
due to remaining US sanctions, is trickling in. The EU oil embargo has
been lifted and major contracts in the area of petrochemicals, civic
aviation and transport are increasingly sealed. Additionally, [the JCPOA
provides a sense of security to Iran]{.underline}. It is highly unlikely
for any party to the agreement to green-light military action by another
party against Iran. Hence, [Iran has little incentive not to abide by
the nuclear deal.]{.underline} [**As such, while the cycle of escalating
rhetoric is discomforting at a time of deep uncertainty and conflict in
the Middle East, it is important to see that it has its limits. Short of
outright regime change, the United States has in fact rather limited
options to weaken and contain Iran.** Given its experiences in places
like Iraq and Afghanistan, it is unlikely that the United States will
launch full-scale unilateral military action against Iran]{.underline}.
It could move to arm a third country to hit Iranian infrastructure. This
was tried with Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Today, Saudi Arabia could be
such a third country. But given the lack of appetite in Riyadh for
direct confrontation with Tehran, and considering the downward spiral in
the Saudi military intervention against Yemen --- the poorest country in
the region --- it is unthinkable that Saudi Arabia would take such a
step. [Israel has repeatedly threatened to attack Iranian nuclear sites.
But considering the low chances of success and the potentially dire
consequences, including retaliatory attacks by Lebanon\'s Hezbollah
movement, it can be argued that such threats primarily serve a political
purpose]{.underline}. Less costly measures aimed at weakening and
containing Iran, such as sanctions, have been tried and tested. The
Obama administration managed to put in place an unprecedented
multilateral sanctions regime targeting Tehran. Yet, it was under those
very sanctions that Iran's nuclear program evolved into what the
international community came to perceive as a major threat to global
security. Consequently, [the Obama administration tried diplomacy. And
it worked. The JCPOA reduced the capacity and increased the transparency
of Iran\'s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of
nuclear-related sanctions]{.underline}. And as the International Atomic
Energy Agency has repeatedly certified, the deal is working. Bearing in
mind the nuclear deal is fulfilling its objectives, the limited military
options to contain Iran, and perhaps most of all the likely US inability
to forge an international consensus against Iran in case of its
unilateral breach of the accord, the security establishments of both
Israel and Saudi Arabia have publicly urged Washington not to dismantle
the JCPOA. While reveling in the newfound reassurances from Washington,
it can thus be argued that Riyadh and Tel Aviv understand the limits of
the cycle of escalation and mostly take solace in Trump\'s unwillingness
to realize their nightmares under Obama. In this vein, the Trump
administration can be expected to do whatever it can to minimize the
economic benefits Iran will reap under the JCPOA. It will likely seek to
discredit Iran\'s regional policies to prevent the normalization of the
Islamic Republic\'s ties with the world, while also diminishing the
political capital the deal affords Iran. But it will do this short of
breaching the accord. **[Thus, while likely to squabble about respective
obligations and further drift away from rapprochement, neither Iran nor
the United States has the incentive or ability to take the new cycle of
tension to a military confrontation.]{.underline}**

**Multiple factors constrain Iranian aggression or adventurism**

To accurately gauge the strategic challenges from Iran over a ten- to
fifteen-year horizon, [this study sought to assess the motivations of
the Islamic Republic, not just its capabilities.]{.underline} **[This
approach]{.underline}**, although difficult given the complexities of
the Iranian system, **[is critical in identifying potential sources of
caution and pragmatism in Iran's policy]{.underline} formulation**. [Our
exploration of Iranian strategic thinking revealed that **ideology and
bravado frequently mask a preference for opportunism and
realpolitik**---the qualities that define "normal" state
behavior.]{.underline} Similarly, when we canvassed Iran's power
projection options, we identified not only the extent of the threats
posed by each but also their limitations and liabilities. In each case,
[we found significant barriers and buffers to Iran's strategic reach
rooted in both the regional geopolitics it is trying to influence and in
its limited conventional military capacity, diplomatic isolation, and
past strategic missteps]{.underline}. Similarly, [tensions between the
regime and Iranian society]{.underline}---segments of which have grown
disenchanted with the Republic's revolutionary ideals---[can also act as
a constraint on Iranian external behavior.]{.underline} ¶ This leads to
our conclusion that [analogies to the Cold War are mistaken: The Islamic
Republic does not seek territorial aggrandizement]{.underline} [or even,
despite its rhetoric, the forcible imposition of its revolutionary
ideology onto neighboring states. Instead]{.underline}, it feeds off
existing grievances with the status quo, particularly in the Arab world.
Traditional containment options may actually create further
opportunities for Tehran to exploit, thereby amplifying the very
influence the United States is trying to mitigate. A more useful
strategy, therefore, is one that exploits [existing checks on Iran's
power and influence]{.underline}. These [include the gap between its
aspiration for asymmetric warfare]{.underline} [capabilities and the
reality of its]{.underline} rather [**limited conventional forces**,
disagreements between Iran and its militant "proxies," and the potential
for sharp criticism from Arab public opinion, which it has long sought
to exploit]{.underline}. In addition, we recommend a new U.S. approach
to Iran that integrates elements of engagement and containment while
de-escalating unilateral U.S. pressure on Tehran and applying increased
multilateral pressure against its nuclear ambitions. The analyses that
informed these conclusions also yielded the following insights for U.S.
planners and strategists concerning Iran's strategic culture,
conventional military, ties to Islamist groups, and ability to influence
Arab public opinion.

**Adv \-\-- Cohesion**

**[1NC \-\-- NATO Fails]{.underline}**

**NATO cohesion does not provide any practical benefits.**

**Carpenter 22** --- Ted Galen Carpenter, Senior Fellow for defense and
foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, PhD in U.S. diplomatic
history from the University of Texas, 2022 ("NATO Security Dependents
Are Not Useful Allies," *CATO,* January 8^th^, Available Online at
<https://www.cato.org/commentary/nato-security-dependents-are-not-useful-allies>)

SINCE THE end of World War II, [U.S. officials have had an **unduly
expansive** concept of what constitutes worthwhile strategic allies for
the United States. In too many cases, the "allies" that Washington touts
are **small**, **weak**, often **militarily useless**
dependents]{.underline}. [Worse, some of them are on bad terms with more
**powerful neighboring states**]{.underline}. Under those
circumstances[, the so‐​called allies are **major liabilities** rather
than assets to the United States]{.underline}. Indeed, [they are
potential snares, ones that can **entangle America** in unnecessary
military confrontations]{.underline}.

Washington would do well to become far more selective about which
nations it includes in its roster of allies, and U[.S. leaders should
stop elevating security dependents to the status of allies]{.underline}.
When U.S. officials described the regimes that Washington installed
through military force in Afghanistan and Iraq as allies, it became
clear that they had lost even minimal understanding of the concept. That
point became abundantly evident when their Afghan client collapsed
almost overnight in the face of the Taliban military offensive. It's
time for U.S. policymakers to do better.

[TROUBLING PROMISCUITY about acquiring weak U.S. security partners was
evident even during the Cold War, and the tendency has become **even
more pronounced** in the post‐​Cold War era]{.underline}. As the fiasco
in Afghanistan (and its ugly predecessor in South Vietnam) confirmed,
that problem with U.S. foreign policy has existed in multiple regions.
However, the defect has become most acute with respect to Washington's
campaign to expand NATO into Eastern Europe. Since the mid‐​1990s, [U.S.
administrations have worked to add a menagerie of new NATO members, and
it has done so with even less selectivity and good judgment than some
people use to acquire Facebook friends]{.underline}.

[Many of those new members have **very little to offer** to the United
States as security partners. Indeed, some are mini‐​states, bordering on
being micro‐​states. Such lightly armed Lilliputians would add little or
nothing to Washington's own capabilities---especially in a showdown with
another major power.]{.underline}

[As economic assets, their importance is **decidedly limited**, and
militarily, they are **even less valuable**]{.underline}. [It's **hard
to see** how new NATO allies such as Albania, Slovenia, Montenegro, and
North Macedonia enhance America's **power** and
**security**]{.underline}. That point should be apparent based on size
of population alone. Albania's 2.87 million, North Macedonia's 2.1
million, and Slovenia's 2.07 million people put those countries squarely
in the mini‐​state category, while Montenegro's 628,000 barely deserves
even that label. It doesn't get much better with respect to either
annual gross domestic product or size of military forces. Even
Slovenia's \$52.8 billion GDP puts that country only eighty‐​sixth in the
global rankings. Albania's \$15.2 billion (125th), North Macedonia's
\$12.26 billion (135th) and Montenegro's \$4.78 billion (159th) are even
less impressive.

T[he military forces that our new NATO allies can field are **not
likely** to strike fear into Russia or any other would‐​be
aggresso]{.underline}r. Albania's armed forces consist of 8,500
active‐​duty personnel, Slovenia's consist of 8,500, and North Macedonia
has 9,000 available. [Montenegro's active‐​duty force totals 2,400. In
comparison, the Austin, Texas, police department has 2,422 people in its
ranks.]{.underline}

Granted, the Cold War edition of NATO also had some mini‐​states as
members, most notably Luxembourg and Iceland. However, those members
were located within a stable, democratic Western Europe. Their defense
also was geographically inseparable from Washington's mission of
protecting important military and economic players, such as West
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Great Britain, from what appeared to
be a totalitarian superpower with expansionist ambitions[. That
situation was qualitatively different from Washington's gratuitous
post‐​Cold War decision to manage the security of quarrelsome mini‐​states
in the chronically volatile Balkans]{.underline}. Since the mid‐​1990s,
the United States has entangled itself in the region's parochial spats,
but giving some of the countries NATO membership intensified America's
exposure to needless risks and burdens.

[THE RISK-BENEFIT calculation is **even worse** with respect to some of
the other small nations that have joined NATO in the post‐​Cold War era.
Those partners are not merely irrelevant from the standpoint of U.S.
security; they are potentially dangerous tripwires that could trigger a
conflict between the United States and a nuclear‐​armed
Russia.]{.underline}

That point underscores one very important difference between individuals
casually amassing Facebook friends and the United States promiscuously
adding new security mendicants. [Facebook friends do not have the
ability to entangle anyone in armed conflicts; irresponsible security
dependents definitely can do so. Indeed, there are multiple examples
throughout history of such clients snaring their patrons into
devastating, unnecessary wars]{.underline}. One notable example was how
Tsarist Russia's fateful decision to give strong backing to Serbia in
the latter's escalating quarrel with Austria‐​Hungary following the
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand helped ignite World War
I---and caused the utter ruin of the Russian empire.

[The United States is flirting with a similar danger today regarding its
small clients in Eastern Europe. President George W. Bush's decision to
support the NATO membership bids of the three Baltic republics was---and
remains---highly provocative to Russia.]{.underline} One crucial way to
reduce the danger of armed clashes between great powers is to show
mutual respect for respective spheres of influence. Washington has
repeatedly violated that principle by pushing NATO to expand right up to
Russia's border.

Before President Donald Trump attempts real diplomacy with Russian
President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki on July 16, he\'ll
first be subjected to another summit. That first summit is a gathering
of leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}). These leaders continually [assure the United
States they are America\'s best allies, even as most contribute little
to America\'s defense and rack up huge trade surpluses with the United
States]{.underline}. [Trump]{.underline} will insist on a better deal
but [should go farther and wind down U.S. membership in
NATO]{.underline}. After the alliance was established in 1949, its first
secretary general, Lord Hastings Ismay, summed up its purpose concisely:
"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down." The
unofficial mission matched the time well: Western Europe's postwar
future was clouded by the prospect of a Soviet invasion, American
insularity, or German militarism--- all possible given the preceding
decades of history. Nearly seventy years later, none of these concerns
still exist. Furthermore, NATO\'s opposing alliance during the Cold War,
the Warsaw Pact, quit the Soviet Bloc in 1989, and the Soviet Union
itself passed into history in 1991 ---twenty-seven years ago. Despite
endless searches for a new mission to justify its massive burden on U.S.
taxpayers, [**NATO has failed** to be of much]{.underline} use since
then. As its boosters like to remind us, after 9/11, the alliance
invoked its Article 5 mutual-defense provision on our behalf. But action
from America's allies did not follow the grandiose gesture---[the NATO
mission in Afghanistan relied mostly on U.S. forces and effectively
failed.]{.underline} Today, the alliance's bureaucrats and some [member
states spotlight a threat from Russia as a reason for keeping the
organization alive]{.underline}, along with a laundry list of "train and
equip" missions. Yet [NATO members\' defense budgets don\'t reflect a
real sense of danger from Russia or anyone else]{.underline}. Among the
twenty-nine members, [only the United States is really serious about its
Article 3 obligations to defend itself]{.underline}, spending
approximately \$700 billion or 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense. [No
other NATO member comes close]{.underline} to this proportion, and the
[vast majority fail even to meet the modest, self-imposed requirement to
devote at least 2 percent of GDP to defense]{.underline}. Britain and
Poland are rare members that meet the 2 percent requirement. One of the
worst free-riders is Canada, which spends just 1 percent of its GDP on
security, amounting to \$20 billion. Furthermore, Germany spends a
similarly pathetic 1.2 percent. Compare that to non-NATO members facing
real threats, some of which spend 5-10 percent of their GDPs on defense.
These include Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who must
contend with Iran and spend nearly a combined \$100 billion. Israel,
which faces the same enemy, adds \$15 billion to the equation. Despite
protestations of poverty at a time when their economies have never been
larger, NATO members are more than willing to rack up additional
liabilities, knowing America has their back. Last year, the alliance
welcomed Montenegro. It is now poised to admit the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, which would mean the United States is pledged to
defend a nation that devotes just \$120 million per year to its own
defense, not quite as much as the Cincinnati Police Department. But the
reality is [there is no truly capable Russian foe seriously threatening
the West]{.underline}. Russia has one million uniformed personnel in its
military, the world's second-largest behind America, but the European
Union could easily afford to match that with its combined \$17 trillion
economy---ten times larger than Russia's. However, it needn't bother as
[Moscow spends just \$61 billion on its overwrought
military]{.underline}, which doubles as an employment program. Russia's
Vladimir Putin has gotten the most from Russia's military, occupying
parts of Georgia and Ukraine and gaining influence in Syria by backing
the Assad regime. Still, his success in all three cases rested heavily
on surprises that Moscow seems unlikely to be able to repeat against
prepared and adequately funded European militaries. Yer we should expect
to hear none of this nuance at the NATO summit, as poohbahs of the dying
old European political order gather to tut-tut President Trump in the
alliance's fancy new \$1.4 billion headquarters, funded predominantly by
American taxpayers. To get out of this abusive relationship, Trump
should begin the process of limiting America\'s role in NATO. A [good
model is that of Sweden, which cooperates with NATO on some matters and
not on others. Such an approach could allow joint training, but end the
practice of having overburdened U.S. taxpayers foot the bill for wealthy
Europeans\' security]{.underline}. As part of this plan, [Trump could
mothball U.S. bases in Europe and shift most resources spent there and
in the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific region, where China and Iran pose
real threats to America---and against which **NATO is
irrelevant**]{.underline}. Europe is prosperous and treats America like
a patsy. Let it stand on its own.

likely to step in as continental Europe's offshore power]{.underline},
though, of course, with diminished capabilities compared to those of the
United States. A Europeanized NATO would tie Britain to the continent
and perhaps become part of the answer to the troubled British-E.U.
relationship. The European Union would not be able to stand still in the
face of such a security transformation. [France and Germany
would]{.underline} likely [seek to rescue their institutional project by
accelerating the construction of a core that would allow France to
extend security guarantees]{.underline} to Germany in return for French
access to German financial governance, and [which would create an E.U.
periphery]{.underline}, notably in Eastern Europe, alongside countries
such as Ukraine and Belarus. It is probable that **[Western Europe could
rescue its commitment to collective institutions]{.underline}**,
including collective defense, but it is unlikely that it could extend
security guarantees far eastwards, as NATO today is able to. A revised
bargain with Russia will then become necessary, one in which the
sovereignty of Eastern European countries will be questioned.

https://www.thenation.com/article/the-transatlantic-alliance-will-survive-trump/

Every week, [often more than once a week, there's a]{.underline}nother
[article in the major media]{.underline} or in
foreign-policypublications [about the demise of the]{.underline}
post--World War II Anglo-American world order. These analyses typically
single out the [transatlantic alliance]{.underline} between the United
States and Europe―two of the world's largest economies―for special
concern and anxiety as the underpinning of this world order. Not
surprisingly, President [Trump's]{.underline} wildly fluctuating
[comments on NATO]{.underline} (despite the fact that he is expanding
it), [his unprecedented **rudeness to Europe**an leaders, and his
**friendliness with**]{.underline} Vladimir [**Putin** at]{.underline}
the [Helsinki]{.underline} summit have [all added to the
angst]{.underline}. The basic story behind this moaning and melancholy
is that US leaders put together a "rules-based" system based on "open
markets" and democracy (the two are sometimes seen as synonymous) that
has fostered prosperity and relative stability. The United States was
the only sizable industrial economy to emerge not only unscathed but
doubled in size following the war. While others might have taken
advantage of this unrivaled power for their own gain, the story goes,
America's beneficent rulers constructed a world order for the good of
everyone. Trump is seen as a threat to its continued existence. This
assessment of the postwar world order leaves out some 3 million dead
Vietnamese and half a million dead in Indonesia, who might question the
beneficence of this system if it had not killed them. A million dead
Iraqis, if they could be heard, would probably also raise objections
about whether US dominance has been in the interests of all. And there
are hundreds of millions of people in Latin America, Africa, and other
parts of Asia who suffered for decades under US-backed dictatorships, as
well as US-sponsored wars. Much of the violent dysfunctionality in these
countries today is a direct result of these interventions, as well as
continuing US influence. In fact, as I write this now, the US military
is directly involved in a war that has deliberately produced what the UN
has called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, in Yemen. That
war has pushed more than 8 million peopleto the brink of starvation,
created the worst outbreak of cholera in modern history, and killed
thousands of civilians in bombing raids. Washington is providing midair
refueling to the Saudi and UAE bombers, intelligence, targeting
assistance, on-the-ground military personnel, and more―constrained only
by growing opposition in Congress. But let us ignore these inconvenient
truths for a moment, as almost all of these analyses do, and look at the
present situation. [In fact, the transatlantic **alliance is much
stronger** than most of these analysts recognize]{.underline}. This is
mainly because it is not just an alliance of democratic governments with
shared values, but also one of the rich countries of the world―their
ruling elites, that is―against the poor and middle-income countries of
the world. [The rules of the **W**orld **T**rade
**O**rganization]{.underline}, to which 164 countries are bound, [were
written by US and European corporations]{.underline}. The WTO's most
significant achievement since its creation in 1995 was to increase
US-style patent protection throughout the world, leading to the death of
millions of poor people who cannot get access to essential medicines.
After years of struggle, some of these rules were rewritten, but much
damage remains. The WTO's rules on agriculture also greatly disadvantage
developing countries and seek to prohibit governments from subsidizing
domestic production for domestic consumption to feed people who are
badly malnourished, for example in India. WTO rules also make it much
more difficult for developing countries to employ the industrial
policies that high-income countries like the United States used to get
where they are today. [The **I**nternational **M**onetary
**F**und,]{.underline} an organization that has 189 member countries,
[is run by the United States and Europe]{.underline}. In fact, for most
of the world outside of Europe, the US Treasury Department is in charge.
The World Bank, which by custom since 1946 has to have an American as
its president, is also controlled by Washington and its allies, and
cooperates with the IMF in promoting and imposing economic policies that
Washington favors. These policies are often not in the interest of
developing countries, as one would expect from organizations that are
not accountable to low- and middle-income countries, or to any
electorate. [These are the institutions of global governance that
exercise power in the world]{.underline}, other than the
**[UN]{.underline}** Security Council, [where the transatlantic alliance
must share **veto power** with **Russia and China**.]{.underline} The
IMF, for most of the past half-century, has been the most important
avenue of US influence over low- and middle-income countries. It has sat
at the top of a creditors' cartel, where countries that did not agree to
IMF conditions would not get loans from other multilateral lenders
(e.g., the World Bank) and sometimes not even from the private sector.
This cartel lost influence in most middle-income countries in the first
decade of the 21st century, but it has been coming back (e.g.,
inArgentina), and it still maintains its creditors' cartel in poor
countries. [European leaders are quite angry about]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration['s unilateral abrogation of the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action]{.underline}, the negotiated agreement with
[Iran]{.underline} that had put an end to the threat that it would
develop nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future. Europe clearly has
much more of a security risk stemming from Middle East turmoil, which is
worsened by Trump's threatened war with Iran; not to mention all the
political problems that have been created by the refugee inflow that was
primarily a result of US intervention there. [**But what did they do**
about it, after their anxious pleading with Trump failed to move him?
**Nothing**, because these leaders―quite apart from the people of
Europe, who have been screwed royally since the Great Recession―need
their beloved partner in crime]{.underline}. The United States is the
gendarme of the rich countries' global economic and political order.
This is partly because Washington did not suffer the destruction that
Europe did in the world wars, and partly because Europeans have
developed welfare states that do not allow for the fantastically
wasteful military spending that maintains 800 US military bases around
the globe. But Washington's weapons of mass and ordinary destruction are
by no means its whole arsenal. The "exorbitant privilege" of being able
to print the world's most important currency, which makes up 60 percent
of global reserves held by central banks, is another. [When Lehman
Brothers collapsed in 2008 and the world financial crisis hit, the
Federal Reserve arranged currency swaps for its European partners to
make sure they didn't suffer any temporary international liquidity
problems. On the other side of the divide, if you are outside
Washington's good graces, the **dollarized** world financial **system**
allows the United States vast power to enforce **sanctions** against you
(e.g., in the cases of Cuba, Venezuela, and Iran), whether or not the UN
approves]{.underline}. [Europe's elites are **bound** to the rulers of
the **U**nited **S**tates by virtue of their **common interest** in
maintaining dominance over the world **economy**. This is true despite
the fact that their spoils do not trickle down to the
citizenry]{.underline}. This transatlantic dominance won't last forever.
Eurasia, the world's largest land mass, which bred the colonial powers
that conquered the world, continues to increase its economic
integration, despite Washington's efforts to counter this
world-historical trend with its attempted TPP and TTIP commercial
agreements. China's economy is already 25 percent larger than that of
the United States on a purchasing-power-parity basis (this is the
measure most often used by economists for international comparisons,
since it takes into account price differences between countries). In a
decade, it's projected to be about twice as big as that of the United
States. Over time, European countries, led by their corporations and
financial institutions, will look more to the East and less to the West
as the world becomes more multipolar and the US share of the world
economy shrinks. But [for the near future, the **US and Europe**an elite
**need each other**]{.underline} as the global hegemon tries to hang on
to its unelected position. [Trump can be as rude, crude, and ignorant as
he pleases with his European allies, but **it won't make them rebel**
against the "leader of the free world."]{.underline}

My chapter, though, did not look for specifc studies which could support
one specifc argument (e.g. 'democracy is a good thing' or 'democracy has
instrumental value as it brings peace between states'). [The aim of the
chapter was to investigate the question whether democracy leads to
interstate war or peace, by analysing **dozens** of statistical studies
which have been selected in a systematic way. The analyses revealed many
caveats.]{.underline}

[The first caveat is that **none** of the studies which have directly
tested the democratic peace hypothesis demonstrated that democracy is
the only and most important factor when explaining interstate war.
Some]{.underline} studies [provided evidence that other factors are
significant as well, and other studies indicated that alternative
explanations are much more powerful, sometimes even showing that the
impact of democracy is simply spurious. Geographical and economic
factors, for example, play a key role as well, and tend to be far more
important, so it is certainly not only democracy which
matters.]{.underline}

[Secondly, these findings are based on quantitative
studies,]{.underline} **[which show correlation but not necessarily
causation]{.underline}**. While there is a lively ongoing debate about
the causal mechanisms, it is still unclear how we can understand and
interpret the expected absence of interstate war between democracies.
[The number of studies which criticize these ideas has increased
considerably]{.underline} since the mid-1990s, [not just theoretically
but particularly empirically as there is no strong evidence to back up
the ideas that norms and institutional constraints are the key
mechanisms]{.underline} (see Hayes 2011). [Moreover, the quest to find
the underlying mechanisms should not get priority anyway in future
research]{.underline}, in my view, [as the statistical evidence for the
democratic peace hypotheses is weak overall]{.underline} (see frst
caveat above).

[Thirdly, democracies are not more peaceful than
dictatorships.]{.underline} While there might be some evidence for
democratic peace among democratic states (or at least a correlation),
[democracies are not more peaceful in general. The evidence for a
monadic link is not clear, not signifcant and certainly not robust.
There is no clear support for the monadic peace hypothesis which states
that interstate war is less likely in democracies compared to
dictatorships in general. And democracies do fight with
dictatorships---**quite a lot**.]{.underline}

[Finally, 'democratizing for peace' seems a dangerous route to take, as
democratizing states fight most---more than both democracies and
dictatorships]{.underline}. Democracies might not fght with each other,
but the [countries that are democratizing are quite
**war-prone**]{.underline}. Moreover, [there is convincing evidence that
hybrid systems (or semi-democracies) are more likely to be involved in
interstate wars, not only compared to countries with higher levels of
democracy but also to countries with lower levels of
democracy.]{.underline} Democratization can be a very unpredictable and
possibly dangerous process, and the fndings in this chapter show that
[democratizing for peace is likely to end in a deadly
disaster.]{.underline}

Based on those fndings, this chapter comes to the controversial
conclusion that eventually [we cannot defend the notion that it really
matters whether you live in a dictatorship or democracy, at least not
with regard to the likelihood that an interstate war will take place in
your country]{.underline}. In other words, **[democracy is not a panacea
for peace in general, and we cannot be sure that people living in
democracies have less chance to experience an interstate
war]{.underline}** compared to people living in dictatorships. [People
living in democratizing and hybrid systems seem to be most at risk,
which means promoting democratization would not be wise, at least not
when achieving peace is the ultimate goal. Hence, war is most likely in
democratizing countries]{.underline}. Still, the chance of an interstate
war is low in the other political systems---so not only in democracies
but in dictatorships as well. In this sense, the idea that democracies
make a signifcant difference is not convincing.43 The (instrumental)
value of democracy cannot be found in being less war-prone and bringing
peace between countries.

Caveat 1: It's Not (Just) Democracy

[While analyzing the selected articles, the first remarkable finding is
that only a relatively small number of studies have actually tested the
democratic peace hypothesis. Most of the studies have focused on the
mechanisms]{.underline} (see next section, caveat 2), [and hence seem to
assume that there is a correlation between democracy and war. In this
way, the majority of the studies---often unintentionally---reinforce the
idea that democratic peace actually exists without testing this
proposition.]{.underline} However, [none of the studies that directly
test the democratic peace hypothesis found strong evidence that
democracy is the most important factor when explaining interstate war.
All democratic peace studies have controlled for many possible
alternative causes of the peace, such as economic development and
growth, geographic distance and contiguity, power status, alliance ties,
militarization and political stability. The findings show that **it is
not just democracy which explains war, not at all**.]{.underline} Within
this group of studies, which explicitly test the democratic peace
hypothesis, four different types of fndings can be detected. I will
discuss those results more in-depth in the rest of this section.

[First Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are
Signifcant Too]{.underline}

[The first subgroup consists of scholars who stress the importance of
democratic peace, despite the fact their own analyses have shown that
other factors are statistically signifcant as well]{.underline} (Maoz
and Russett 1993; Rousseau et al. 1996; Gleditsch and Hegre 1997; Beck
et al. 1998; Ray 2013). [For example, some studies]{.underline} (e.g.
Rousseau et al. 1996) [included alternative independent variables in
order to test realist arguments]{.underline}. They tested whether the
distribution of power determines decisions to use force, and measures
each state's military capabilities relative to its opponent. A state's
military capability is the average of three elements: number of troops,
military expenditures and military expenditures per soldier. They found
that this realist variable was strong, positive and statistically
signifcant at the 0.001 level in their analyses (see, e.g., Rousseau et
al. 1996: 522, Table 2). However, [not only a state's military
capabilities appeared to be an important explanation for peace. In
addition, wealth, growth, alliances and contiguity played a crucial role
when explaining interstate war]{.underline} (see, e.g., Maoz and Russett
1993: 632, Table 1).11 [Moreover, when other factors are included, the
impact of democracy on the likelihood of international crises is even
spurious]{.underline} (Maoz and Russett 1993: 632; Henderson 2002: 141,
see also p. 3).12 [Still, scholars in this group keep defending the
democratic peace idea, despite the fact that their own analyses showed
the signifcance of alternative explanations.]{.underline}

[Second Result: Initially There Is Correlation, but the Impact of
Democracy Is Spurious When Other Explanatory Factors Are Included in the
Models]{.underline}

[The second subgroup of scholars is far more radical. Based on their own
analyses, this group concludes that the democratic peace link is a
spurious one]{.underline} (Weede 1984, 1996; Barbieri 1996; Mousseau
2013; Gartzke and Weisiger 2014).13 Typically, efforts to demonstrate
the spuriousness of the statistical democratic peace pointed to other
factors that, when accounted for 'properly', eliminated or dramatically
reduced the statistical signifcance of shared democracy. Hence, [the
studies in this second group did not find strong evidence for the
democratic peace hypothesis anymore, once other explanatory factors were
included in the models.14]{.underline}

One of the most convincing alternative explanations of peace between
countries is that there is no democratic peace, but a capitalist peace
instead. The settlement in Germany and Japan succeeded because of the
establishment of capitalist peace. Because of economic support by the
Americans, who encouraged free trade and offered trade opportunities in
practice as well, the poorer economies in Europe and Japan would gain
economically, resulting in 'economic growth, prosperity, and,
ultimately, free trade among most of the more technologically advanced
economies' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 232). By establishing and
expanding free trade, the incentives for war would quickly decrease
among trading states, according to this approach. To prevent new
interstate wars after World War II, the capitalist peace was a far more
important factor than the American promotion of democracy and its
political institutions.

The capitalist peace, or capitalist peace theory, also states that
economic development accounts for both democracy and the peace among
democratic nations. Economic development is a key factor to explain
democracy (Lipset 1959; see also Hegre 2003; Weede 2004).15 Moreover,
economic development also plays a role when explaining peace, and the
presence of market-oriented economies in countries have a positive
impact on both democracy in those countries and peace between them
(Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2013; see also Hegre 2014). Democratic
peace only exists when both democracies have high levels of economic
development, when economic development is well above the global median.

In fact, the poorest 21% of the democracies studied, and the poorest
4--5% of current democracies, are signifcantly more likely than other
kinds of political systems to fight each other (see, e.g., Mousseau
2005). Moreover, if at least one of the democracies involved has a very
low level of economic development, then democracy cannot prevent war.16
Still, there is a pacifying effect of free trade and economic
interdependence, which is more important than the effect of democracy,
because the former affects peace both directly and indirectly, by
producing economic development and ultimately, democracy (see Weede
2004).17

[Capitalist peace]{.underline} is not the only alternative explanation.
[Shared interests in general, and political similarities in specifc, can
also be seen as an important second alternative explanation for war and
peace between countries]{.underline} (Farber and Gowa 1995, 1997;
Gartzke 2007; Gowa 1999; Henderson 2002). [Democracies are not peaceful
to each other because they are democratic, but rather because they are
similar. So the difference of the scores of both countries also
contributes to the confict proneness of the dyad. If the difference in
levels of democracy is big, then the chance of confict is
higher]{.underline} (cf. Oneal and Russett 1997: 281--282).

Many researchers have conflated both the conflict-dampening impact of
joined democracy and the confict-exacerbating impact of political
distance in the variables focusing on political systems, but as Errol A.
Henderson (2002: 32) convincingly argued: 'Fusing these two contrasting
attributes in a single variable makes it diffcult to distinguish between
the competing processes'. Therefore, it is better to include an
additional variable of 'political dissimilarity' in the model. Henderson
(2002) was one of the frst scholars who included this variable and
measured it by taking the absolute value of the difference between the
two states' scores. His main variables were not only political
similarity, but also geographic distance and economic interdependence,
and he concluded that democratic peace is a statistical artefact which
disappears when those other variables are taken into account. Political
similarity clearly has a pacifying effect18 (see Werner 2000; Henderson
2002; Beck et al. 2004), and it is not democracy per se which is the
decisive factor.19

Hence, the benefts of trade and trade interdependence are essential
explanations, while democracy is spurious or at least subordinate (see
also Rosecrance 1986; Weede 1984, 1996; Hegre 2000, 2014; Jervis 2002;
Souva 2003; Rasler and Thompson 2005: 235; Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003,
2005). Based on those studies, it is safe to conclude that democracy, on
its own, is an unlikely cause of the democratic peace.

[Third Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are Much
Stronger]{.underline}

[This same point that democracy is just one of the explanations for
peace (and not even a very important one) is also at the core of studies
in the third subgroup. Scholars of this group keep arguing that there is
support for the democratic peace hypothesis, and that the link is not
spurious. In this sense, they are less radical than the second group of
scholars, as they do not completely reject the value of democracy for
peace. On the other hand, their own analyses have clearly shown that
alternative factors---hence other factors than democracy or type of
political system--- are not only statistically signifcant but also more
important when trying to explain interstate war]{.underline} (Bremer
1992; Gelpi 1997; Oneal and Russet t 1999a, b; Reiter and Stam 2002;
Peterson 2013; Caselli et al. 2015).

[Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggest that democracy is
not the most important factor, while war is more likely to occur between
states that are geographically proximate, approximately equal in power,
major powers, allied, economically advanced and highly militarized than
between those that are not]{.underline}. Bivariate analyses of these
factors in relation to the onset of interstate war over all pairs of
states in the period from 1816 to 1965 have generally supported these
associations. However, multivariate analyses revealed some differences.
Stuart Bremer (1992), for example, showed that some factors are far more
important than others. The existence of a dangerous, war-prone dyad can
be best explained by the presence of contiguity, the absence of an
alliance and the absence of more advanced economy. The absence of
democratic polity and other factors (absence of overwhelming
preponderance, and presence of major power) are less powerful. [Overall,
these fndings suggest that our research priorities may be seriously
distorted and that we should not focus too much on the perceived
positive impact of democracy, but on other factors (such as alliances
and economic factors) instead.]{.underline}

[Fourth Result: There Is Correlation, but Only Under Certain Specific
Conditions]{.underline}

[The final subgroup of scholars argues that we cannot unconditionally
accept the idea that democratic peace exists in general, so always and
everywhere. Their statistical studies clearly showed that support for
this hypothesis heavily depends on other factors.]{.underline} The
chance of democratic peace depends not just on the specifc historical
period (Cold War or not; Gibler and Sarkees 2004; Siverson and Emmons
1991; Weede 1984), but also the stage of the confict (beginning,
duration or severity; see Bremer 1993; Bennett and Stam 1996; Reed
2000), and on the neighbourhood instability (extent of confict in the
region; see Gibler and Braithwaite 2013; Gibler and Miller 2013).
Despite the differences between the studies, there is one common finding
in all studies: when explaining interstate war, we cannot just rely on
the impact of democracy, as it is too much dependent on other factors.

[Several scholars found strong evidence for the idea that democratic
peace exists, but only during some **specific historical periods**.
Based on this evidence, they concluded that democratic peace is simply a
statistical artefact of the Cold War]{.underline}. For example, Henry
Farber and Joanne Gowa (1995) found statistical support for the idea
that peace between democracies is an artefact of the Cold War, when the
threat from the communist states forced democracies to ally with one
another (see also Mearsheimer 1990). Sebastian Rosato (2003) also argued
that most of the signifcant evidence for democratic peace has been
observed after World War II; and that it has happened within a broad
alliance, which can be identifed with NATO and its satellite nations,
imposed and maintained by American dominance.

Since the Second World War, war has become a very costly affair.
Scholars discovered that only a handful of states are 'capable of
engaging in major power warfare. That process of elimination has not yet
extinguished the possibility of major power warfare, but it has lowered
its probability immensely' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). The chance
to achieve something in a war is low in general, and even lower in a
bipolar world with two big power players risking high nuclear war costs
(Jervis 2002). While war became more costly, trade became less costly;
as a consequence, the war/trade costs increased during the Cold War
(Rosecrance 1986; see also Jervis 2002). In such a world, war and
confict have become less attractive, while trade and cooperation have
become more appealing (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). Hence, more
states decided to adopt trading strategies in order to prevent confict
and war as much as possible. In the end, democracy was part of the
story, but only a very small part with a subordinated role next to the
power dynamics during the Cold War, the costs of warfare and the benefts
of trade.

Some scholars found evidence that the democratic peace still exists in
the post-Cold War period (Park 2013) which weakens this argument.
However, [most analyses showed that dyadic dispute rates have converged
after the Cold War]{.underline} (see, e.g., Gowa 2011). [Moreover,
jointly democratic dyads are likely to be allied only after
1945]{.underline} (see Gibler and Sarkees 2004); [during the 1816--1944
time period, there is even a negative relationship between democratic
dyads and alliance formation.20 These findings cast serious doubts on
the idea of a general existence of democratic peace.]{.underline}

Not only the historical period, but also the stage of the confict is
crucial. Some scholars in this group provided evidence that democratic
peace is not universal, but that it depends on the stage and whether we
focus on the beginning, duration or severity of the confict. Although
joint democracy has some pacifying effects on the onset of confict, the
results suggest that they are unrelated to the escalation of disputes to
war (see Reed 2000). Moreover, democratic peace is dependent on the
neighbourhood instability. Democracies often have few territorial issues
over which to contend, as they tend to be part of a stable region.
Democracies only seldom have territorial disputes with their neighbours,
and therefore they can more easily choose favourable conficts to
escalate. The type of political system does not predict confict
selection or victory once controls are added for issue salience (Gibler
and Miller 2013; see also Park and James 2015). There is an interaction
between joint democracy and regional instability, which confrms the idea
that the effects of type of political system on continued confict apply
mostly to dyads in peaceful regions (Gibler and Braithwaite 2013; see
also Park and James 2015). Very democratic countries might even become
more aggressive and faster than other political systems, once the region
becomes more hostile (see, e.g., Baliga et al. 2011).

The General Lesson from the Results in a Nutshell (Caveat 1)

[In short, regardless of the differences between the statistical studies
on democratic peace, all findings have indicated that other explanations
are important as well. It is clear that democracy is just one of the
explanations, and certainly not the most important one,21 sometimes even
spurious and often heavily dependent on other factors. It is not (just)
democracy to be preoccupied with, when trying to prevent war between
countries]{.underline} (Table 3.1).

**[DPT False]{.underline} --- [economic norms theory]{.underline} fully
accounts for it.**

**Mousseau 13** --- Michael Mousseau, Professor at the University of
Central Florida, teaching International Relations Theory, Political
Economy of War and Peace, and Terrorism and Insurgency, former professor
at Koç University, holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from Binghamton

[Model 2 presents **new knowledge** by adding the control for economic
type]{.underline}. To capture the dyadic expectation of peace among
contract-intensive nations, [the variable Contract-intensive EconomyL
(CIEL) indicates the value of impersonal contracts in force per capita
of the state]{.underline} with the lower level of CIE in the dyad; [a
high value of this measure indicates both states have contract-intensive
economies]{.underline}. As can be seen, [the coefficient for
CIEL]{.underline} ()0.80) [is **negative** and **highly
significant**]{.underline}. [This corroborates that impersonal economy
is a highly robust force for peace]{.underline}. [The coefficient for
DemocracyL is now at **zero**]{.underline}. [There are **no other
differences between Models 1 and 2**]{.underline}, whose samples are
identical, and no prior study corroborating the democratic peace has
considered contract-intensive economy. Therefore, the standard
econometric inference to be drawn from Model 2 is the nontrivial result
that [**all prior reports** of democracy as a force for peace are
probably **spurious**, since this result is predicted and fully
accounted for by **economic norms theory**]{.underline}.

CIEL and DemocracyL correlate only in the moderate range of 0.47
(Pearson's r), so the insignificance of democracy is not likely to be a
statistical artifact of multicollinearity. This is corroborated by the
variance inflation factor for DemocracyL in Model 2 of 1.85, which is
well below the usual rule-of-thumb indicator of multicollinearity of 10
or more. Nor should readers assume most economies: [While almost all
nations with contract-intensive economies]{.underline} (as indicated
with the binary measure for CIE) [are democratic]{.underline} (Polity2
\> 6) (Singapore is the only long-term exception), [more than
half]{.underline}---55%---[of all democratic nation-years have
contract-poor economies]{.underline}. At the dyadic level in this
sample, [this translates to 80% of democratic dyads]{.underline} (all
dyads where DemocracyBinary6 = 1) [that have at least one state with a
contract-poor economy]{.underline}. In other words, [not only does Model
2 show no evidence of causation from democracy to peace]{.underline} (as
reported in Mousseau 2009), [but it also illustrates that this absence
of democratic peace includes the **vast majority**---80%---of democratic
dyad-years over the sample period]{.underline}.

[Nor is it likely that the causal arrow is reversed---with democracy
being the ultimate cause of contract-intensive economy and
peace]{.underline}. This is because [correlations among independent
variables are not calculated in the results of multivariate regressions:
Coefficients show only the effect of each variable after the potential
effects of the others]{.underline} are kept constant at their mean
levels. [If it was democracy that caused both impersonal economy and
peace, then there would be some variance in DemocracyL
remaining]{.underline}, after its partial correlation with CIEL is
excluded, [that links it directly with peace]{.underline}. [The positive
direction of the coefficient for DemocracyL informs us that no such
direct effect exists]{.underline} (Blalock 1979:473--474).

[Model 3 tests for the effect of DemocracyL if a control is added for
mixed-polity dyads]{.underline}, as suggested by Russett (2010:201). As
discussed above, to avoid problems of mathematical endogeneity, I adopt
tohe solution used by Mousseau, Orsun and Ungerer (2013) and measure
regime difference as proposed by Werner (2000), drawing on the
subcomponents of the Polity2 regime measure. As can be seen, the
coefficient for [Political Distance]{.underline} (1.00) is positive and
significant, corroborating that regime mixed dyads do indeed have more
militarized conflict than others. Yet, the [inclusion]{.underline} of
this term [has no effect on the results that concern us here:
CIEL]{.underline} ()0.85) [is now even more robust, and the coefficient
for DemocracyL]{.underline} (0.03) [is above zero]{.underline}.7

[Model 4 replaces the continuous democracy measure with the standard
binary one]{.underline} (Polity2 \> 6), as suggested by Russett
(2010:201), citing Bayer and Bernhard (2010). As can be observed, [the
coefficient for CIEL]{.underline} ()0.83) [remains **negative and highly
significant**, while DemocracyBinary6]{.underline} (0.63) [is in the
positive (**wrong**) direction]{.underline}.

As discussed above, [analyses of fatal dispute onsets with the far
stricter binary measure for democracy]{.underline} (Polity = 10), [put
forward by Dafoe]{.underline} (2011) in response to Mousseau (2009),
[yields perfect prediction]{.underline} (as does the prior binary
measure Both States CIE), [causing quasi-complete separation and
inconclusive results]{.underline}. Therefore, [Model 5 reports the
results with DemocracyBinary10 in analyses of all militarized conflicts,
not just fatal ones]{.underline}. As can be seen, the [coefficient for
DemocracyBinary10]{.underline} ()0.41), [while negative, is not
significant]{.underline}. [Model 6 reports the results in analyses of
fatal disputes with DemocracyL squared]{.underline} (after adding 10),
[which implies that the likelihood of conflict decreases more quickly
toward the high values of DemocracyL]{.underline}. As can be seen, [the
coefficient for DemocracyL 2 is at zero, further corroborating that even
very high levels of democracy do not appear to cause peace in analyses
of fatal disputes, once consideration is given to contractintensive
economy]{.underline}. [Models 3, 4, and 6, which include Political
Distance, were repeated]{.underline} (but unreported to save space)
[with analyses of all militarized interstate disputes, with the
democracy coefficients close to zero in every case]{.underline}.
Therefore, [the conclusions]{.underline} reached by Mousseau (2009) [are
corroborated even with the most stringent measures of democracy,
consideration of institutional distance, and across all specifications:
The democratic peace appears **spurious**, with contract-intensive
economy being the **more likely explanation** for both democracy and the
democratic peace]{.underline}.

[NATO allies have made slow but steady progress when it comes to
crafting policy to deal with cyber security challenges]{.underline}. Yet
this progress has not always been made in a collaborative fashion.
Especially when it comes to the development and deployment of offensive
cyber capabilities, NATO allies are increasingly diverging in policy.
This is a worrying development and deserves more attention than it has
so far received. Steady progress [Member states **agree on the critical
need** for a **coherent cyber policy.** Almost all NATO allies have
developed both a cyber security strategy and a cyber defense
strategy]{.underline}.[\[1\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn1)
Some states have published updated versions over the years to reaffirm
cyber security as an issue of national security importance, to tweak
institutional responsibilities, or to articulate changes in the threat
landscape. In addition, since 2018, [most NATO allies have established a
military cyber organization]{.underline} (either a command or unit) with
a mandate to conduct cyber effect operations -- that is, cyber
operations intended to disrupt, deny, degrade and/or
destroy.[\[2\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn2)
There is also **[shared recognition that international law applies in
cyberspace]{.underline}**, although allies have yet to spell out the
legal procedures for operating in this new "domain of warfare." These
developments have been both [reflected in, and aided by, policy progress
made at the inter-governmental level]{.underline}. At the Prague Summit
in 2002, [NATO for the first time recognized that the Alliance should
"Strengthen]{.underline} our **[capabilities to defend against cyber
attacks]{.underline}**."[\[3\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn3)
In 2008, at the Bucharest Summit, there was another milestone
development, when [NATO adopted a "Policy on Cyber Defense," aiming to
"protect **key information**]{.underline} systems **[in accordance with
their respective responsibilities]{.underline}**; [share best practices;
and provide a capability to assist Allied nations]{.underline}, upon
request, to counter a cyber
attack."[\[4\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn4)
In the same year, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence --
a NATO accredited international research institution -- was established
in Tallinn, Estonia. In 2016, at the Warsaw Summit, cyberspace was
officially recognized as a "domain of operations" and allies made a
Cyber Defense Pledge to enhance their cyber
defenses.[\[5\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn5)
The 2018 Brussels Summit and 2020 London Summit reiterated NATO's
commitment to implement the Cyber Defense Pledge and operationalize the
Cyber Operations Center, responsible for situational awareness and the
centralized planning of cyber operations and
missions.[\[6\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn6)

**[1NC \-\-- Alt Causes]{.underline}**

**Alt causes for NATO collapse**

**Boffey 18** (Daniel Boffey; Guardian\'s Brussels bureau chief;
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/transatlantic-relationship-at-risk-says-nato-chief>;
6-19-18)

[The head of Nato]{.underline} has [warned that the deep divisions
between the US]{.underline} under Donald Trump [and its European allies
are not going away and there is no certainty that the transatlantic
relationship and its military alliance will survive]{.underline}.
Against a backdrop of Trump's open baiting of the German chancellor,
Angela Merkel, over immigration and her domestic difficulties, Jens
Stoltenberg has called for all Nato members to work to avoid a
disastrous breakdown in western unity. Writing in the Guardian, Nato's
secretary general admits that "[political storm clouds" are putting a
strain on]{.underline} the [ties]{.underline} that bind the Nato allies.
But, in an appeal to leaders before the military alliance's summit in
July, the former prime minister of Norway says that "where differences
persist, we must limit any negative impact on our security cooperation".
Stoltenberg -- who is meeting Theresa May in Downing Street on Thursday
as he prepares for the summit in Brussels -- writes: "Since the alliance
was created almost 70 years ago, the people of Europe and North America
have enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. But, at
the political level, the ties which bind us are under strain. "**[There
are real differences between]{.underline}** the United States and other
**[allies over issues such as trade, climate change and]{.underline}**
the **[Iran]{.underline}** nuclear agreement. "[These disagreements are
real and they won't disappear overnight.]{.underline} In fact,
**[nowhere is it written in stone that the transatlantic bond will
always thrive]{.underline}**. That doesn't, however, mean that its
breakdown is inevitable. We can maintain it, and all the mutual benefits
we derive from it." Stoltenberg's intervention comes at a point of
extreme tension among the leadership of the western powers. In seeking
to defend his administration's policy of separating children from their
parents at the country's border, Trump launched an extraordinary attack
on Merkel and the EU on Tuesday, likening Europe to a "migrant camp"
while claiming that "the people of Germany are turning against their
leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin
coalition". Merkel is embroiled in a tense standoff with her interior
minister over immigration. She faces a two-week deadline to find a
European solution or risk the collapse of her governing coalition. Trump
has already caused a fracture in relations with traditional US allies by
reneging on his country's commitments in both the Paris climate change
agreement and the nuclear deal with Iran. He is also threatening a
transatlantic trade war with the EU, and has criticised Germany and
others for not spending enough on defence and freeloading off the US. Of
the 29 Nato members, only eight, including the US and the UK, spend more
than 2% of their GDP on defence, a threshold that the alliance agreed
should be met by all the countries by 2024. Germany spent €37bn
(£32.5bn), or 1.2% of GDP, on defence last year. Asked for his position
last month on those countries underspending, Trump warned: "They'll be
dealt with." Greater "[burden sharing" is set to be a theme of the Nato
summit]{.underline} in Brussels, along with Stoltenberg's desire to
improve the readiness of Nato forces to deploy in quick order, and to
build on the alliance's counter-terrorism efforts, including through the
training of the Iraqi military and an extension of financing for Afghan
forces until 2024.

Testing Alliance Consensus and Decision-making [The Alliance's
decision-making principle of consensus further complicates the
negotiations and agreement of a NATO offensive cyber
policy.]{.underline} The above-mentioned nuclear example almost
exclusively concerns kinetic and state-level physical destruction of
massive proportions. The dire consequences of the extremity of possible
nuclear proliferation are enough to establish credibility, deterrence,
and is a comparatively simpler way in getting its 30 member states on
board, especially in the context of Cold War bipolarity. [Cyberspace as
a domain of war contains a myriad of vested technical issues including
the difficulty of attributing attacks to specific
adversaries.]{.underline} Even though this is one the most prominent
difficulties according to a variety of research in cybersecurity, more
recent analyses published by NATO\'s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence have suggested that the attribution gap is gradually
decreasing in size due to heavy research and development investment into
web tracing and identification designs largely spearheaded by the US
(Burton 11). A dynamic understanding of deterrence in cyberspace as
formerly suggested by taking into consideration social and historical
context will also alleviate the traditionally 'impossible' problem of
attribution. While such technical capabilities play a crucial role in
swaying the allies' considerations and decisions, the political and
strategic issues of simply conceptualizing an offensive cyber policy are
examined in closer detail here. Trust and Transparency [The transparency
and capability-sharing quality of NATO may give way for disagreement
amongst allies]{.underline}. Although the Alliance's communication on a
strategic and policy level is transparent, [it still possesses enough
opaque room to maneuver on an operational and tactical
level.]{.underline} Furthermore, the problem of [American supremacy in
cyber capabilities]{.underline} and NATO's reliance on its critical
perspective [may displease EU member states]{.underline} like France [in
their pursuit of strategic autonomy]{.underline} aside from its
prevailing aversion to today\'s American leadership. A new demand for
[cross-alliance intelligence-sharing on offensive cyber capabilities can
also exacerbate internal trust issues with the US.]{.underline} The
global [surveillance disclosures]{.underline} from 2013 onwards
[revealed allied surveillance and spying activities which damaged
confidence in NATO (Smeets; 2018). Discussion of further integrated
intelligence-sharing strategy under an offensive cyber policy can create
tension between Five Eyes states (Canada, the US, and the UK) and other
NATO allies]{.underline}. Doctrine Diversity Another overarching aspect
with the potential to determine allies' reception and leniency towards
an offensive cyber strategy is the diversity of threat perception among
NATO allies[. The diversity across allied standards in defining the
parameters of cyberattacks and the lack of overarching offensive cyber
policy could result in strategic ambiguity and discourage retaliation
(Arts 2). These differences stem from varied threat perceptions and
cyber norms.]{.underline} Nationally, both threat perception and cyber
norms are influenced by the state's experience with malicious
cyberattacks and its media and public opinion; and externally, the
state's engagement in bilateral and multilateral engagements are the
most effective ways in which threat perception and cyber norms are
shaped (Lewis 575). This hints at the political interest of near-Russia
states like Estonia and Finland to possess well-rounded cyber norms and
threat perception. Conversely, policy engagements on offensive
capabilities would also shape NATO allies' understanding as a whole.
[Without multilateral definitions, allies like Luxembourg and Iceland
who have not experienced similar events do not benefit from harmonized
knowledge and may not find justification to prioritize the strengthening
of cyber capabilities when allocating funds from the common NATO
budget]{.underline}. Not to mention the financial commitment issue
affects trust in the Alliance overall as well.

Concerning the three categories and the potential policy shifting
described above, NATO finds itself in a difficult situation that, under
current NATO practices, will be hard to escape. In terms of the cyber
threat, defense, and technology approaches, NATO reflects behavior that
puts the Alliance at a disadvantage. [NATO tends to be conservative in
terms of legal issues, meaning that the Alliance does]{.underline} not
[promise]{.underline} to be [a fruitful forum for]{.underline} adapting
or revising legacy rules to reflect the particular challenges
**[cyber]{.underline}** poses. Similarly, with NATO operating on the
basis of consensus, the [Alliance's decision-making
processes]{.underline} might have [difficulty handling governance
questions created by the cyber]{.underline} defense
**[approach]{.underline}**, such as how "active" should NATO cyber
defense be. Operationally, NATO cyber defense appears more static and
reactive than active in orientation---a situation that could lead NATO
cyber defense to become a cyber "Maginot line" rather than an effective
defensive strategy. It is [not clear whether NATO members could reach
consensus]{.underline} on what more active cyber defense activities
would be permissible under international legal principles on sovereignty
and non-intervention. As noted earlier, NATO functions with the
capabilities its members make available to it, meaning that NATO's
technological capabilities in cyber might not reach cutting-edge status,
leaving NATO cyber defense behind the global technological curve in
cyberspace. This problem is exacerbated if policy makers in leading
powers, such as the United States and China, are placing more reliance
on developing, deploying, and using full-spectrum cyber technological
capabilities because of the perceived pitfalls of other approaches and
the mounting geopolitical competition now affecting cyberspace. [NATO
members are also extraordinarily sensitive to the Alliance having any
offensive cyber capabilities or even discussing the need to think
about]{.underline} the value of [cyber capabilities and
operations]{.underline} in missions [NATO might undertake]{.underline}
(as NATO has done with other technological developments affecting its
military missions).44 The North Atlantic Council has not discussed, let
alone authorized, the development of offensive capabilities, doctrine,
or rules of engagement in the cyber realm.45 [Whether NATO members could
agree on]{.underline} what **[offensive cyber operations]{.underline}**
international law would permit [is also not clear, especially in light
of difficulties cyber presents to the international law]{.underline} on
armed conflict **[revealed by the Tallinn Manual]{.underline}** and
other analyses.46 Events outside the specific context of NATO cyber
defense might also adversely affect NATO cooperation. For example, in
June 2013, negative [European reactions to the disclosure of a secret
U.S. surveillance program targeting cyber activities]{.underline} of
foreign nationals, code-named PRISM, [reflected new transAtlantic
tensions on **government surveillance in cyberspace**]{.underline}, its
implications for privacy and other civil liberties, and the potential
for European-American cooperation on cybersecurity. The Washington Post
reported that "\[t\]he **[discontent from Europe pointed]{.underline}**
to the breadth of fallout from the affair and [to the potential for
fresh strains between the United States and allies wary of American
intrusiveness]{.underline}."47 Whatever the long-term impact of this
political fallout, [the short-term consequences will likely not create
more willingness among NATO members to become more
ambitious]{.underline} with NATO cyber defense.

Challenges to a smooth integration of cyber effects

[The abovementioned incidents have led cyber-conflict scholars to point
to **several technical** and **practical difficulties** in the
operational integration of cyber effects]{.underline}.29 In the
interviews and background conversations that contributed to this study,
three of these difficulties were continuously reiterated when discussing
successful integration of cyber effects into NATO operational planning:
the temporal dimension of developing exploits; the assessment of battle
damage; and the problem of confliction.

Developing exploits---a matter of time

One of the characteristics of [cyber attacks that receives most
attention is the fact that they **hit suddenly** and **without
warning**]{.underline}.30 While this is often the case, [the central
question for operational integration is not the speed at which they hit
their target, but the speed with which the tools and techniques that
exploit IT vulnerabilities in order to deliver cyber effects can be
developed]{.underline}. Like conventional weapons, the cyber tools---the
exploits or cyber weapons---take time to develop. [However, an exploit
is often harder to reuse than a conventional weapon, as it is more
dependent on a meticulous analysis and target preparation---in this
case, specifically, the target\'s IT infrastructure]{.underline}.
Without knowing the adversary\'s IT systems and its vulnerabilities
better than the adversary itself, meaningful cyber weapons are
impossible to develop.

[The fact that knowledge about the target is linked not only to the
deployment of a weapon but also to its development influences the extent
to which it can be used and reused]{.underline}. [Stuxnet, for example,
required **years of development**, **testing** and **perfecting** before
it could deliver the intended effect on the Iranian
centrifuges]{.underline}. Despite the techniques used in the Stuxnet
malware having been found in other malware,31 Stuxnet lost its ability
to destroy the centrifuges when it was discovered and the IT
vulnerabilities that enabled it were patched. Importantly, part of the
complexity of Stuxnet relates to the US--Israeli intention to keep the
effect secret. In a hot conflict, secrecy in terms of the effect is
often less important, and thus the development and deployment of cyber
effects do not necessarily have to be as complex and time-consuming.

This observation does not necessarily change the fact that the
[development of exploits often has to **precede** the military
confrontation in which they are intended to be used]{.underline}. [NATO
states that want to deliver cyber effects in NATO operations must try to
gain access to Russia\'s or other potential adversaries\' critical
military networks to identify and exploit IT
vulnerabilities]{.underline}. As several informants emphasized, [if
states wait for a conflict to escalate before they begin the development
of exploits, it is most likely to be **already too
late**.]{.underline}32

[The alternative to penetrating adversary networks in peacetime is for
states to rely on the exploitation of vulnerabilities in as many
commercial off-the-shelf products as possible]{.underline}. This can be
done, for example, by purchasing exploits from private companies
offering this service, in the hope that it will then be possible to
quickly create an overview of the enemy\'s IT infrastructure and adapt
the exploits to this environment when a conflict escalates. [The latter
approach is more likely to succeed against adversaries with low network
security, which does not apply in the case of Russia, or in contexts
where less sophisticated and less closely targeted cyber effects are
required]{.underline}.

Whether member states develop sophisticated exploits for future targeted
effects or stockpile well-known exploits to cause more minor effects,
[they **cannot**---as several informants indicated---**be certain** that
they will be able to deliver the cyber effect at the specific time it is
requested by CYOC.]{.underline} [This is because the IT vulnerabilities
upon which exploits depend **might not exist** for ever]{.underline}.
[Cyberspace is a **dynamic environment**: vulnerabilities are patched,
systems are updated or replaced and bad IT security practices are
identified and improved. This means that exploits are **temporary in
nature** and **cannot be stored** for later use]{.underline}.33 [States
must constantly ensure that the exploits still work, which requires
minor adjustments when updates take place. As a consequence, the larger
the military 'cyber arsenal', the more **technically skilled** human
resources are needed for its maintenance]{.underline}. [In the current
labour market, where recruitment and retention of a cyber workforce is
difficult, extensive investment is required for states to be able to
stand ready with cyber effects available when requested]{.underline}.

In short, [if a state is to offer a cyber effect in a NATO operation,
then the state is likely to have to be able, first, to predict what
Russian IT systems it is going to target months or years in advance, and
second, to marshal the necessary resources to develop and maintain a
large array of exploits that can be used against these systems. Even if
this is successfully done, the state still faces difficulty in ensuring
that an effect is delivered as promised.]{.underline}

Assessing effects---ensuring proportionality and discrimination

[How likely is it that the requested cyber effect will be delivered? The
answer to this question is **not clear**, in respect of either its
preparation or its execution]{.underline}. [This is not only because IT
vulnerabilities are constantly discovered and patched; it is also
because of the difficulty of assessing the effects and possible
side-effects of an exploit when navigating and analysing complex IT
infrastructures. In other words, reconnaissance is difficult in
cyberspace, and so is the containment of effects]{.underline}. The
Russian attempt to use ransomware aimed at disrupting critical Ukrainian
infrastructure in 2017, for example, succeeded---but simultaneously
encrypted computers globally, causing substantial economic damage to
multinational businesses such as Maersk and FedEx.34

[**Collateral damage** and **unintended consequences** are **serious
issues** for NATO]{.underline}. The alliance takes pride in its
adherence to the principles laid out in international law, such as
proportionality and discrimination, as former NATO Deputy Assistant
Secretary-General Jamie Shea has emphasized.35 [Thus, disruptions of
servers with huge negative implications for civilians, or the use of
generic cyber tools that risk spreading their effects far and wide, are
most likely **not going to be considered** for use in NATO
operations]{.underline}. Indeed, one of the main challenges to US
efforts to disrupt servers in working against ISIS was finding ways to
ensure that civilians were not hit by their cyber effects.36

[Another aspect of the difficulty of assessing the cyber effect relates
to adversaries\' cyber defence efforts. For the more sophisticated
players in cyberspace, cyber defence has developed into more than simply
patching, clearing and updating systems. Cyber defence is also
increasingly about following an intruder\'s activity in one\'s own
network and creating 'honeypots' or 'honeynets'; or about following data
traffic back to the intruder\'s network. In short, cyber defence is also
about deception and active defence.]{.underline}37 This approach to
cyber defence offers valuable insights into the intruder\'s techniques
and strategies; but the mere knowledge that deception is becoming a
predominant defensive strategy also introduces doubts into the
intruder\'s assessment of possible effects.

Consequently, as Russia is considered a peer competitor with
considerable cyber-defensive capacities[, one informant expressed
**scepticism** about the extent to which smaller member states are
**confident** in their ability to deliver a cyber effect when it is
requested by NATO.38 This is especially the case if operational success
depends on a **specific effect**]{.underline}. Even if a state has
developed the appropriate exploit, it must also be able to verify that
the effect is achieved and ensure that the effect is contained to
minimize collateral damage. And even if a state is confident about its
current ability to contain and verify an effect, it must also be
confident that it can deliver, verify and contain the effect at the
specific time in the future when CYOC requests it.

[The process of integration is **further complicated** by the fact that
NATO must be willing to hand over to contributing states the
responsibility for making battle damage assessments and collateral
damage estimations]{.underline}. As the following subsection shows,
[states are generally **unwilling to share** classified information
about exploits]{.underline}. Hence, [the delegated NATO commander is
**unlikely to receive** much useful information about how cyber effects
are delivered before a decision about their deployment must be
taken]{.underline}. As commanders would prefer to have control over the
capabilities used, member-state cyber effects are likely choices of
method only if alternative, conventional effects are unavailable.

The challenges associated with assessing cyber effects are naturally
most significant in relation to those effects that enable other kinetic
effects that are necessary to achieve operational success. [For cyber
effects that seek to maintain a persistent annoyance of Russian
networks, these challenges are less of an issue. If the aim is to create
confusion and drain resources by targeting networks and operations that
are otherwise difficult and expensive to disrupt using conventional
means, then cyber effects can support strategic goals without causing
irreversible damage to civilians]{.underline}. As I will conclude at the
end of this section, such a change demands an adaptation of the way in
which CYOC operates.

C. [Capability and Force Development Priorities **Assuming NATO can
overcome** conceptual and policy hurdles, **significant effort** will
still be required to develop the **necessary forces** and
**capabilities** across all domains, but perhaps especially for
cyberspace.]{.underline}

[Operationalising MDO demands a '**calibrated force posture'** with
multi-domain formations **strategically positioned**, held at
**readiness** and able to deploy over **large distances**, **trained**
and **equipped**]{.underline} to operate across multiple contested
domains (Grispen-Gelens, 2020). The vision is for different sensors and
shooters to share and fuse data, build a common operating picture,
inform rapid decision-making and deliver effects at a time and place of
the commander's choosing and to do so agnostic of domains, nation,
service or platform (Niewood, Grant & Lewis, 2019). [Forces must operate
at pace and against an adversary contesting all domains. This tempo
necessitates moving beyond NATO's past focus on synchronisation of
pre-planned effects in individual domains towards more agile targeting
and more resilience against hostile attempts at 'disorganisation' or
'systems attack']{.underline} (Thomas, 2019; Engstrom, 2018).

[Linking all this together demands **novel approaches** to
C4ISR]{.underline}, as reflected in investments in JADC2 (Harrigian,
2020). [This US initiative leverages advances in information and
communication technologies such as mesh networks, cloud and edge
computing, open architectures, data analytics, AI and machine learning,
autonomy and automation, software-defined systems, robotics, satellite
communications and sophisticated cyber and EMS capabilities]{.underline}
(Hitchens, 2019). Future JADC2 networks must be secure, robust,
resilient, agile and more decentralised, with enough bandwidth to share
data in a timely and secure manner despite cyber attacks, jamming,
spoofing or physical destruction of communication nodes (Goldfein,
2017). [Trust is also **essential**, handling data from different
sources and at multiple security levels without making controls so
arduous that Reliance on connectivity makes cyberspace, space and the
EMS the 'centre of gravity' for MDO]{.underline} (Hess et al., 2019).
[JADC2 introduces **obvious challenges** from a cyber threat
perspective, both in terms of the attack surface for different threat
vectors and the cascading effects from hostile cyber
activity]{.underline}---though, of course, existing centralised C2 hubs
also have their own vulnerabilities to cyber or physical attack (Hess et
al., 2019). [Improved cyber capabilities are not only needed to
**secure** and **enable** operations in **other domains**]{.underline}
(Reilly, 2020[). Investments by Russia and China to contest cyberspace
and the EMS may also **limit the ability** of NATO commanders to employ
**offensive cyber capabilities** at a time and place that will
'converge' with effects through other domains.]{.underline} Securing
networks against disruption is critical at the operational and strategic
levels given requirements for reach-back to headquarters, especially
constraining organisations responsible for delivering offensive cyber
effects, since these are likely to be physically located in the homeland
(Watling & Roper, 2019; Nettis, 2020).

While NATO and its member states adapted to the new security environment
after the end of the Cold War by scaling down the military investments
and presence in eastern Europe and by focusing more on crisis
management,53 much of the Cold War deterrence language returned when the
Russian--Ukrainian conflict broke out in 2014.54 What needs to be
deterred today, much of the literature agrees, is not only a full-scale
military invasion but to a larger extent the use and support of
pro-Russian militant separatists who are willing to apply insurgency
tactics in NATO\'s post-Soviet member states.55 [As a result, the
allies\' military investments have been increasing again]{.underline},56
a number of initiatives such as the Enhanced Forward Presence in the
Baltic States and Poland have been introduced,57 and the
discussions---and disagreements---on the nuclear deterrence (of
non-nuclear threats) have re-emerged.58 [Such responses are often
presented as a renewed attempt by NATO to reassert its deterrence and
assurance posture by signalling strength, preparedness and willingness
to punish 'bad' behaviour]{.underline}.59

At first sight, the introduction of CYOC seems to add to these
deterrence efforts. NATO added an offensive cyber option to reinforce
its ability to impose costs sufficient to dissuade adversaries from
acting aggressively. [On closer examination, however, it is not
self-evident that requesting member states\' delivery of offensive cyber
effects in NATO operations constitutes a **necessary** or even a
**substantial addition** to credibly signalling the ability and
willingness to punish an adversary]{.underline}. [NATO\'s conventional
capabilities are clearly already far superior to Russia\'s---with or
without fully integrated cyber effects.]{.underline} [Thus, a deterrence
failure, resulting for example in a scenario in one of the Baltic states
similar to that which occurred in eastern Ukraine, will **not be the
result** of NATO\'s lack of available cyber tools in its military
toolbox]{.underline}; rather, if the Russian leadership were to consider
it in its interest to pursue such a scenario, it would mean that
Russia\'s decision-makers did not believe in the credibility of NATO\'s
article 5 or in NATO\'s ability to mobilize its forces. [The capacity to
integrate cyber effects would do **nothing to change**
that.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [if the establishment of CYOC is an attempt to signal
defensive strength and unity in cyberspace, it remains **difficult to
imagine** that such signalling would **dissuade adversaries** from
trying to penetrate NATO and allied systems. CYOC does not change the
fact that NATO is **not tasked** to govern and secure national IT
systems.]{.underline} In an operational setting, states might connect to
each other through so-called federated mission networking;60 but there
is no tradition of ceding control of the deployed national networks to
NATO during military operations. [Hence, CYOC can only realistically
seek to become a hub for cyber-threat information-sharing and to support
states\' coordination and synchronization of various national responses
to these threats. In other words, CYOC is **unlikely** to become an
active defender in cyberspace that causes doubt in the adversary\'s
evaluation of its own cyber capabilities]{.underline}. [This also means
that even if CYOC\'s coordination and information-sharing efforts manage
to contribute to the denial of intrusions into allied systems, an
adversary\'s military is unlikely to be deterred from trying to hack
these systems. In fact, actively articulating that CYOC is supposed to
deter (through denial) a perceived adversary such as Russia from hacking
NATO and allied operational systems creates an incentive to do just that
and thereby show that the alliance is incapable of doing what it says it
seeks to do.]{.underline}

It could be argued, [given NATO's defensive orientation ( pace Russian
fears of diabolic plots), that a **purely defensive** and **technical
focus** for cyber operations is appropriate]{.underline}. [The question,
however, is whether NATO can field a credible military force without
some public linkage to an offensive cyber capability.]{.underline}

Here again, [the **nuclear precedent** offers some suggestions for a way
forward.]{.underline} In the NATO phonetic alphabet, "whiskey" ("W") and
"romeo" ("R") were used by NATO's command structure in conflict to
"warn" capitals that with a deteriorating situation on the ground it
would be sending a request to release nuclear weapons for NATO use.
Romeo was the actual request for release of nuclear weapons to NATO
control. This terminology prepared nuclear capitals to make the decision
on release.

[Just as nuclear weapons remain under national control but senior NATO
commanders can request their release, the US and UK could retain control
of offensive cyber capabilities but be prepared to make them available
to NATO commanders upon request]{.underline}. In practice[, national
teams could be assigned to support NATO commanders in theatre or could
carry out some operations against targets selected by NATO commanders
form their national duty station.]{.underline}

[Dissimulation is an essential part of hybrid warfare, and Europe and
the US face a propaganda barrage that is much more sophisticated than
the clumsy Soviet efforts of the Cold War]{.underline}. Despite this
clumsiness, a good portion of the Western public has found it
persuasive. Similarly, those critical of NATO will find new complaints
about aggression and militarisation credible. [Russia has **already
complained** that NATO's **defensive cyber doctrine** is **destabilising
warmongering** and part of a larger conspiracy to **advance western
hegemony**]{.underline}.11 [The Snowden revelations have lent a powerful
impetus to Russian propaganda.]{.underline}

[Behind the rhetoric lies]{.underline} both a desire to conceal their
own use of cyber operations and [a **real fear** that Russia's decline
leaves it **vulnerable** to new military technologies.]{.underline} The
intent is to hamper and complicate any Western response to Russian
efforts to regain control in Crimea and the "near abroad". [The Russian
position is that NATO's new cyber doctrine is **destabilising** as it
threatens to use conventional or even **nuclear responses**]{.underline}
(in the Russian description of the new policy towards low-level cyber
attacks).

[**Any announcement** by NATO relating to **offensive cyber
capabilities** would be greeted with **alarm** and **vitriol** in
Moscow]{.underline}. However, the effect on stability would likely be
less pronounced. [NATO-Russia relations are already in steep decline. It
is possible that any NATO announcement would accelerate
this]{.underline}, but it is also possible that Russia could recalculate
the risk of further adventures if it were faced with a stronger defence.
In terms of opponent attitudes, there is probably little effect.
[Russia, along with NATO's other potential military opponents, is likely
to **overestimate both capabilities** and coordination among NATO member
states and **underestimate NATO's will** to defend]{.underline}. [This
is an unhappy combination as it makes aggression against NATO seem
**less risky**.]{.underline}

NATO's decision on how cyber attacks could trigger Article 5, while
greeted with complaints, had a stabilising effect. It made clear to
potential opponents that cyber attacks are not risk-free. Similarly, a
clear enunciation of how NATO would use offensive cyber capabilities as
part of any defensive operation would also change opponents' risk
calculations in ways that would force them to consider how offensive
actions, even if intended to be covert, are not free of risk or cost.

The Cyber Club

Some level of cyber capability is being acquired by all advanced
militaries, and perhaps a dozen countries can be identified from public
sources as procuring offensive cyber capabilities. These countries
include several NATO members. [As with nuclear weapons, the capability
to undertake offensive cyber operations is a club within a club in NATO,
with largely the same membership -- the US, the UK and
France.]{.underline} Germany's armed forces may also be developing
offensive cyber capabilities.12 The well-developed procedures for
release and for integration into NATO planning created for nuclear
weapons do not exist for cyber attack, although it is currently far more
likely that any NATO military operation will have a cyber component,
while the use of nuclear weapons is almost unthinkable.

[The US and the UK both possess elite cyber capabilities. They also have
a close partnership in cyber espionage.]{.underline} This partnership is
centred on a relationship between the US National Security Agency (NSA)
and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), both of
which are intelligence agencies with a long history of supporting
military operations. US military cyber operations are the responsibility
of U.S. Cyber Command, whose commander is also the head of the NSA.
Cyber operations blur the line between intelligence and military
activities. The fact, however, that these are intelligence agencies has
a created a certain reticence regarding the sharing of information on
capabilities and plans, which complicates the integration of offensive
cyber into NATO planning and doctrine.

[Offensive cyber capabilities are still **too new**, with too many
**unknown risks** that hold potentially **profound political
consequences**]{.underline}. US policy is that only the President can
approve a cyber operation likely to result in "significant consequences"
that could produce loss of life or a damaging reaction, although the
Secretary of Defense or the head of U.S. Cyber Command can take
independent action in an emergency[. US policy restricts independent
action by tactical and operational commanders for this reason. A local
commander may not know all the trade-offs or the risks that using a
cyber attack could entail]{.underline}. That said, all of these problems
are manageable with some decision-making model based on the precedent of
the warning and request system used for nuclear weapons release.13

[Until there are better predictive tools and judgments about risk and
consequences, offensive cyber operations will require a **politically
sensitive decision** as to when the benefit of an attack outweighs the
**political risk**]{.underline}. Additional coordination mechanisms
would be needed to decide when the benefits of an attack outweigh the
risk of a loss of intelligence capabilities, or when a target justifies
expending a weapon that might never work again. [The inability to
predict **collateral damage** and **uncertainty** over political effect
encourage caution in the use of offensive cyber operations, but that is
not the same as advertising possession of the capability.]{.underline}

With the world worried about the risk of nuclear escalation between
Russia and the West[, now might also be a good time to worry about the
risk of cyber conflict **escalating to war** as well.]{.underline}

In recent years, a number of scholars and practitioners have argued that
cyber conflict should be seen as an intelligence battle or
pressure-release valve rather than something that could escalate into
actual conflict or war. [Indeed, to date, no state has responded to a
rival's cyber attack with a kinetic reprisal. But that does not mean it
will not happen now. As **geopolitical circumstances** change, the
**escalatory potential** of cyber capabilities is **likely to change**
as well.]{.underline}

[Moscow]{.underline}, for example, [might respond]{.underline} to
Western sanctions [with **intensified cyber attacks**]{.underline}. Or
Western leaders, recognizing that no-fly zones are too risky, might
approve cyber interventions to prevent civilian massacres instead. In
either case, they could well assume this escalation would not meet with
a direct military response. And in either case, they could be wrong.

[Minimizing this risk requires both recognizing and respecting the
latent but **strong escalatory potential** of cyber attacks. It also
involves delving deeper into the psychology of the situation, as
escalation will be driven as much by the perceptions and misperceptions
of the participants as any technical aspects of cyber
warfare.]{.underline}

The Great News

So far, cyber attacks have not proven particularly escalatory or
effective on the battlefield. Even the most provocative incidents that
came closest to resembling kinetic attacks, such as Stuxnet or the
ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, have not led to particularly
menacing crises, much less war. If anything, over the past decade cyber
capabilities have helped de-escalate crises, acting as a "non-kinetic
option for leaders who feel pressure to act in a crisis, but who are
wary of using force."

The U.S. conflict with Iran offers a clear example. After Iran attacked
several oil tankers and downed a U.S. drone in June 2019, President
Donald Trump canceled punitive U.S. airstrikes at the last minute out of
concern that the casualties could prompt further escalation. However, he
allowed nonlethal cyber disruption of Iranian computer systems,
anticipating Iran would not respond violently. Indeed, Iran's supreme
leader "blocked any large, direct retaliation," limiting the country's
response to the cyber realm.

Scholars have offered different explanations for the non-escalatory
nature of these attacks. Cyber effects are "uncertain and often
relatively limited" and "offer great powers escalatory offramps \[and\]
signaling mechanisms" to de-escalate. In the "cyber strategic
competitive space short of armed conflict," states have "tacitly agreed
on lower and upper bounds" and accordingly "have mutual interests in
avoiding escalation to violent conflict." Cyber conflict also has
characteristics of an intelligence, not military, contest.

The Bad News

[Cyber conflicts have flourished during a relatively peaceful time when
major powers generally did not invade one another]{.underline}. [Perhaps
cyber capabilities acted as a pressure release simply because in the
post-Cold War period states usually wanted to de-escalate and the
geopolitical stakes were not that high anyway? What happens now when
Moscow feels that the stakes are **much higher**?]{.underline}

Already [there have been warnings that if Russian forces face **further
setbacks**, Putin may **lash out** in **desperate** and ultimately
**self-harming ways**.]{.underline} [A major cyber power has never faced
such a crisis before, so past performance may be a **limited indicator**
of **future potential**. In fact, the very perception that cyber attacks
are non-escalatory might itself **increase the risk** of unintended
escalation.]{.underline}

[There are multiple ways cyber conflict around the Ukrainian invasion
might escalate into a **direct conflict** between **Russia and
NATO**]{.underline}, possibly as a result of either side's offensives.

First, [Russian offensive cyber operations might spark a **wider
war**]{.underline}. President Vladimir Putin has declared sanctions "are
akin to a declaration of war" and may see aggressive cyber attacks as
the perfect response, particularly since they are reversible and
non-lethal. Russia has been entangled with Western economies for
decades, especially in the realms of energy and finance. But now, as
ties are being severed quickly and viciously, Russia no longer has to
fear the backlash if its cyber forces were to disrupt Western banks or
liquified natural gas terminals. If you are dealt out of the game, why
not just flip the table?

[Russia's cyber generals may be just as **enthusiastic** as their Army
counterparts]{.underline}. They may assure Putin their forces are ready
for battle and can quickly and bloodlessly get the West to back down.
Putin could be convinced disruptive attacks against the West are no big
deal, a low-cost signal that the West should de-escalate or just the
next natural move in a non-escalatory intelligence contest[. After all,
U.S. research found that in response to cyber attacks, "Americans are
less likely to **support retaliation with force**" compared to a more
traditional strike.]{.underline}

[This can **lead to escalation** in two ways. The United States ---
along with countries like the United Kingdom, France, and the
Netherlands --- might well decide to defend forward against such
attacks]{.underline}. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the commander of U.S. Cyber
Command, has insisted his forces "must take this fight to the enemy,
just as we do in other aspects of conflict." His then-deputy has also
argued that the United States "cannot cede any territory" to adversaries
as the "Russians will keep pushing until we push back on them."

Worse, Dmitri Alperovitch recently warned that [if Russia launches cyber
attacks after "\[h\]aving already exhausted the power of economic
sanctions, America and its European allies would have few choices other
than to respond to these attacks with offensive cyber-strikes of their
own." Such dynamics can feed a **spiraling escalation** in cyberspace
that might take on a life outside of the control of
policymakers]{.underline}.

Second, [Western offensive cyber operations might **spark
war**.]{.underline} U.S. cyber espionage and operations against Putin,
his cronies, or Russia's military forces will appear far more ominous to
Putin if he believes they are aimed at regime change. Could Putin turn
the other cheek if the United States were to electronically raid the
cryptocurrency wallets of Russia's sanctions-avoiding kleptocrats? He
might feel the need to escalate his own cyber operations as part of his
own version of defending forward.

[Escalation could happen on the battlefield as well]{.underline}.
According to the New York Times, teams from U.S. Cyber Command are "in
place to interfere with Russia's digital attacks and communications."
Other teams are almost certainly collecting digital intelligence on the
location and intent of Russian combat forces. The United States is
sharing such intelligence with the Ukrainians but apparently not yet
providing any real-time targeting. That may change soon, as the United
States seeks to alleviate intensifying attacks on civilians. And with
his KGB-bred paranoia, Putin might already see the presence of U.S.
defensive and intelligence teams operating on or against Russian
military networks as evidence of direct U.S. involvement in the war.
Confirming his apparent belief that Ukraine is just a NATO puppet, this
might force a response, either inside or outside of cyberspace.

Further, if Western governments have infiltrated Russia's operational
military networks, they may feel pressure to disrupt those networks to
prevent civilian massacres. [Because cyber capabilities are billed as
non-lethal, reversible, and non-escalatory, tub-thumping newspapers may
push decision-makers to take shots they **might not
otherwise**]{.underline}: "We can't create a no-fly zone but can use
cyber capabilities to prevent civilian harm." Some well-meaning national
leaders may succumb to this pressure, potentially causing a larger
conflict.

Crisis," *War on the Rocks,* Available Online at

However, [conducting cyber operations to signal deterrence would,
paradoxically, **increase risks of escalation**]{.underline}. [This risk
is not just hypothetical, especially in light of Russia's updated
declaratory policy for the **first use of nuclear weapons**, which may
include responses to cyber attacks]{.underline}. [Russia has
**reinforced this message** during the war in Ukraine.]{.underline} In
early March, a hacking group affiliated with Anonymous claimed that it
had shut down the control center of Russia's space agency. While denying
that the attack took place, [Russia nevertheless warned that a cyber
attack against its satellites would be a justification for
war.]{.underline}

The Biden administration should clearly communicate that cyber
operations for nuclear signaling are out of bounds, just as it declared
restraint in other aspects of this conflict, like the deployment of
American troops to Ukraine.

How Cyberspace Is Creating Nuclear Risks

[Policymakers and academics are attuned to the cyber risks to nuclear
**command and control**]{.underline}. The practitioner community has
largely focused on U.S. vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.
Scholars, in turn, worry about how [cyber operations could have
**unintended escalatory consequences**]{.underline}. But less attention
has been paid to another likely scenario: the use of cyber operations
for signaling purposes (operations with visible effects that aim to
convey a message to another state) in a nuclear context. [The ambiguity
of cyber operations can sometimes be useful for signaling --- but the
same ambiguity can be **dangerous** during a **nuclear crisis**. The
problem is that civilian leaders in particular, distinct from the
military, are inclined to see cyber attacks as effective signaling
tools.]{.underline}

[Cyber operations could have **nuclear implications**, especially
because modern nuclear command and control systems, like those in Russia
and the United States, are becoming **increasingly dependent** on
digital infrastructure]{.underline}. [Nuclear command, control, and
communications systems, which include early warning, information
collection, and communications capabilities, alert decision-makers to
impending nuclear strikes and also enable leaders to control decisions
about nuclear use (or non-use). But their digital dependencies are
creating opportunities for exploitation using cyber means]{.underline}.
In a 2020 report, the Nuclear Threat Initiative found that "almost 9 out
of 10 planned nuclear modernization programs involve at least some new
digital components or upgrades."

Vulnerabilities inherent in the digital infrastructure that undergird
modern nuclear systems provide opportunities for actors to engage in
cyber espionage --- gaining access to a network or system to steal
information --- or even conduct cyber attacks. Hypothetically, a cyber
power like Russia could conduct a cyber attack against a U.S. early
warning satellite to degrade its functionality. This has become an
urgent concern for practitioners. U.S. Strategic Command, for instance,
is currently working to "operationally harden NC3 systems against cyber
threats." Congress has also gotten involved, requiring the Defense
Department to evaluate the cybersecurity of major weapon systems. And
the Government Accountability Office has published multiple reports
decrying the state of cybersecurity and scope of vulnerabilities of
weapon systems, including elements of the nuclear triad.

From an academic perspective, scholars have investigated how [cyber
operations targeting nuclear systems could **exacerbate escalation
risks**.]{.underline} Focusing on nuclear forces, early research, such
as work by Martin Libicki, was skeptical of the dangers posed by cyber
operations. Nuclear forces were seen as being largely immune from
digital attacks because they were "air gapped," meaning that they were
separated from information technology systems.

However, [as nuclear systems have become increasingly intertwined with
the digital environment --- not to mention the dual-use nature of many
elements of nuclear command, control, and communications systems (like
early warning or position, navigation, and timing satellites) --- the
protection offered by being segregated from the internet is **less
robust**]{.underline}. Jacquelyn Schneider, Benjamin Schechter, and
Rachael Schaffer, for instance, ran a series of wargames demonstrating
that decision-makers in hypothetical crises are likely to use their
cyber exploits against an adversary's nuclear systems. [They found that
this could have negative effects on states' respective nuclear
strategies, especially decisions to pre-delegate **nuclear launch
authority** or **automate nuclear responses**]{.underline}. Erik Gartzke
and Jon Lindsay argue that the clandestine nature of cyber operations
means that one state could secretly gain access to an adversary's
nuclear command, control, and communications systems, giving the former
an information advantage or even creating an incentive for the latter to
use its nuclear weapons out of the fear that it may lose them. [James
Acton notes that the difficulties of distinguishing between cyber
espionage and attack could lead a state to misperceive the intent behind
a cyber operation, generating a similar "**use it or lose it**"

Future Risks

[Even if Russia and the West avoid direct conflict this time, they might
not be so lucky the next]{.underline}. As relations worsen[, future
disruption of critical Western infrastructure by Russian intelligence,
such as the NotPetya and Olympic Destroyer attacks, are less likely to
be viewed as mere crimes. Repeated crises bordering on war may **further
erode** the **tacit agreements** and **relative restraint** of quieter
times. After repeated iterations of intensifying cyber operations, both
Russia and the West may feel their backs to the wall with few options
left other than **military force** when the next crisis --- physical or
cyber --- emerges]{.underline}. Under extreme conditions, some of the
same characteristics that lead cyber capabilities to be a pressure
release might have the opposite effect, a mechanism that Bob Jervis and
I have described as the Escalation Inversion.

[If Putin believes a direct conflict with NATO is **likely** and expects
its adversaries to **take measures to reduce vulnerabilities**, he could
conclude that the best possibility for success is to launch a **massive
preemptive cyber attack**.]{.underline} Since the U.S. military may seem
otherwise unbeatable, this may lead Russia to "compensate with audacity
in order to redress the balance." [The more the United States **brags
about its overwhelming offensive cyber advantage**, but frets over weak
defenses, the more any adversary might **feel the need to target** the
United States as early and as hard as possible.]{.underline}

[If Russia fears war with the United States may happen on Saturday, it
might feel the need to get in its cyber punches on Friday]{.underline}.
If the United States thinks the same, it may need to start on Thursday.
[Cyber capabilities may be to **World War III** as mobilization
timelines were to World War I.]{.underline}

[Since a cyber sucker punch may also seem less escalatory, adversaries
could be **tempted to take risks** they would not
otherwise]{.underline}. In this situation, [the sense that cyber is a
pressure-release valve becomes **positively dangerous**]{.underline}:
[If the system is seen to be stable, then there is less reason to act
with restraint, thereby making it less stable]{.underline}. Fortunately,
the good news is leading U.S. policymakers appear attuned to this risk.

**The plan violates intelligence norms --- causes adversaries to think
they're being attacked.**

Escalation and the dominant intelligence norm

[The large overlap between intelligence collection and attack in
cyberspace makes it difficult to send **clear signals** to adversaries,
in terms of either capabilities or intentions]{.underline}. [When a
foreign entity is moving around in a network, is it then about to start
a **military operation?**]{.underline} [Is the activity part of a
reconnaissance mission? Is it political or economic espionage? Is it
active defence?]{.underline} The difficulty of answering these questions
has created much nervousness among cyber-conflict experts. Ben Buchanan,
for example, [has shown how defensive hacking or intelligence-gathering
in cyberspace is **easily misinterpreted** as aggressive
behaviou]{.underline}r.66 [Why, then, have we not experienced serious
**misinterpretation** and **escalation** in cyberspace?]{.underline}

[One way to explain this is through the existence and dominance of a
largely unspoken but **widely accepted** norm]{.underline}. [For
decades, the **predominant actors** in cyberspace have been
**intelligence agencies**; and the norms that characterize interactions
between intelligence agencies are not primarily concerned with military
concepts such as conflict escalation and deterrenc]{.underline}e.67 In
the world of intelligence agencies, success is not about keeping a
distance between oneself and the adversary by signalling one\'s
intentions and capabilities. It is about being able to outmanoeuvre
adversaries in a space of constant contact.68 There are always risks,
and the work usually takes place in legal grey zones where a clear
distinction between war and peace is not the guiding principle. This is
an arena where the opportunity to annoy, cheat and delay opponents is
taken when it arises. [In short, espionage and counter-espionage **do
not fit well with** the thorough military operational planning that
characterizes **NATO operations**]{.underline}. Intelligence operations,
on the other hand, fit perfectly with a dynamic cyberspace where
anonymity is easy to achieve and uncertainty a constant condition.69
[The states that embrace cyberspace as a domain where the intelligence
norm dominates are able to use a broader array of tools to pursue or
respond to various foreign political objectives than only those that
relate to military operations.]{.underline}

In its 2018 'vision', [the US Cyber Command **built implicitly** on the
dominant **intelligence norm**]{.underline}. Here, the objective is to
become more agile and act as close to the adversary as possible ('defend
forward').70 [The United States considers 'constant contact' and
'persistent engagement' as the necessary guiding principles to achieve
superiority in cyberspace and to take full advantage of the broader
potential for pursuing its political objectives through
cyberspace.]{.underline} During the 2018 US midterm elections, for
example, the US Cyber Command worked closely with the NSA to disrupt
servers operated by the Russian Internet Research Agency aiming to
spread fake news and stir up tension in the United States.71 More
recently, the US Cyber Command responded with various cyber effects
against Iran after the Iranian Revolutionary Guards apparently placed
mines on ships in the Strait of Hormuz.72 These practices illustrate
that, for the United States, cyber effects provide political options
when one does not want to escalate existing tensions into military
confrontation. Defensive coordination between allies through CYOC
supports such defensive use of cyber effects, increasing the possibility
that US Cyber Command will be allowed to 'defend forward' and work
persistently through allied networks.73 A more cyber-active NATO,
however, risks being counterproductive to the ambition to 'defend
forward' through allied networks.

[Unintended conflict escalation from ongoing cyber activity is mainly a
risk if military analysts---in a strategic environment with heightened
attention to military confrontation---**ignore the dominant intelligence
norm**]{.underline}. [If that happens, it becomes more likely that
'persistent engagement' and active cyber defence will be misinterpreted
as **military preparation**, **armament** or the **initial phase of an
attack**]{.underline}. [**If NATO,** an organization that has publicly
returned to its original raison d\'être of deterrence and collective
defence, becomes the entity that **coordinates cyber effects** below the
threshold of armed conflict, then the likelihood increases that Russia
misinterprets these effects as **escalatory** and **acts
accordingly**]{.underline}. In other words, [a **more active NATO** in
the current strategic environment **increases the risk** that the
existing intelligence norm will be **undermined** and replaced by a
**more militarized norm**.]{.underline}

**Broader cyberwar is likely.**

[Much has been written about the fundamental changes in U.S. cyber
strategy]{.underline}. U.S. Cyber Command's vision of "persistent
engagement" and the Department of Defense's new strategy of "defend
forward" have, in particular, [led to numerous critical remarks about
the **risks of escalation** between the U.S. and its main adversaries in
**cyberspace**.]{.underline}

These debates are worth continuing, including about [what the change in
strategy means for establishing norms in]{.underline}
cyberspace[.]{.underline} But commentators have so far ignored a key
dimension: [The strategy's **main implications** may not reside in how
it changes the dynamics between the U.S. and its adversaries but,
instead, in how it affects **broader alliance
relationships**]{.underline}, especially beyond the Five Eyes
(Australia, Canada, the U.K., the U.S. and New Zealand). U[.S. Cyber
Command's mission to cause **friction** in adversaries' freedom of
maneuver in cyberspace may end up causing **significant friction** in
allies' trust and confidence---and adversaries may be able to **exploit
that**.]{.underline}

Since the Cuban Missile Crisis, assured retaliation---eliminating
incentives for a surprise first strike---has been the sine qua non of
strategic stability. The risk for crisis stability is that arms race
instability could revive those incentives, making the deterrent
relationships more "delicate." [With the advent of new technologies,
**escalation during a crisis** could occur in a non-traditional
domain---cyber or space---and could **misleadingly be viewed** as
non-escalatory because it would be non-kinetic]{.underline}. [But an
inadvertent **escalatory spiral** could be set off by a Russian
cyberattack to interfere with U.S. communications with its nuclear
systems or an attack on reconnaissance satellites to blind the United
States.]{.underline} Hints of that potentiality are already manifest:
Russia conducted an anti-satellite missile test last November and,
during the Ukraine war, has carried out extensive cyberattacks, often in
coordination with its battlefield operations.

[In the Ukraine war, as during the Cuban Missile Crisis, inadvertent
escalation remains a **major risk.**]{.underline} [Putin is a risk-taker
(whose agents used a military-grade nerve agent in a 2018 assassination
attempt on a Russian military defector in Britain) and he is **prone to
miscalculation**]{.underline}. His assumptions going in to
Ukraine---that the conflict would be short and decisive, that the
Zelensky government would fold quickly, and that the West would be
feckless in its disunity---were all miscalculations that ironically led
many Western officials and analysts to conclude that he would threaten
but not invade.

Given Putin's propensity for risk-taking and miscalculation, the Biden
administration is exploring scenarios in which [Russian military
"setbacks" and "desperation" (as CIA Director Burns' warned) lead to the
use of **chemical** or **nuclear weapons**.]{.underline} Under what U.S.
officials describe as Russia's "escalate-to-deescalate" strategy, [Putin
might **double down** in the face of adversity by employing a single
weapon for its demonstration effect]{.underline}---to shock the
Ukrainian and Western leaderships into acceding to terms favorable to
the Kremlin. While the Biden administration has not laid down an
explicit deterrent marker specifying the U.S. response, a senior
official warned that [any Russian use of nuclear weapons would mean
"**all bets are off**"---a tacit signal that such a violation of the
nuclear taboo could move the United States and NATO to become **directly
involved** in the war]{.underline}. The Biden administration could
strengthen that deterrent message, as Stanford Professor of Political
Science Scott Sagan has recommended, by communicating directly to the
Russian military that an order from Putin to use a nuclear weapon in
Ukraine would be illegal, a violation of the Geneva Conventions, and
should not be obeyed.

[The challenges of crisis stability to prevent escalation are
**immediate** and **urgent**]{.underline} even as the near-term
prospects for a resolution of the Ukraine war appear remote. The U.S.
policy focus should be on preventing inadvertent escalation. Key to that
imperative is maintaining an open line of communications with Russia's
military leadership. As a disquieting indicator of the virulent
relations between Moscow and Washington, Russia has rebuffed calls from
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to their counterparts.

**[1NC \-\-- Deconfliction Turn]{.underline}**

**The plan causes cyber deconfliction --- that makes effective [OCOs
impossible]{.underline} AND [ruins NATO cohesion]{.underline} --- turns
both advantages.**

**Jacobsen 21** --- Jeppe T. Jacobsen, Visiting Scholar at New York
University, former Cyber Coordinator at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

Studies and the Center for War Studies at the University of Southern

Confliction---the issue of secrecy

[The third challenge to the integration of cyber effects in NATO
operations relates to a well-known military concept, deconfliction. The
coordination by allies and military units of their efforts to avoid
confliction]{.underline}, between for example an air operation and a
special forces operation in the same area, is a central element in every
military campaign. Deconfliction is all about openness and communication
between allied partners. [But in cyberspace, deconfliction comes with
**several difficulties**]{.underline}. At the core of these difficulties
is the [fact that the tools and techniques that produce cyber
effects---which are often also used and heavily depended on for
intelligence collection---are **developed in secret** and **must stay
secret** until the effect is achieved.]{.underline} [If the IT
vulnerabilities and exploits are known, vendors or adversaries can fix
or replace the software and thereby render the effect **impossible to
achieve**]{.underline}.39 In an alliance not known for sufficient mutual
trust among members to share intelligence,40 [there is **little
indication** that allies will become more open about the cyber tools and
techniques they currently have at their disposal]{.underline}. [The
request-based model is the result of that lack of trust]{.underline}.
[And the unwillingness to share cyber intelligence **seriously
challenges** NATO\'s ambition to use CYOC to facilitate
**information-sharing** to increase situational awareness and thereby
achieve the '**cyber readiness'** and '**cyber
resiliency'**]{.underline} that NATO Deputy Secretary-General Mircea
Geoană hopes to attain.41

Furthermore, [**lack of coordination** and discussion about the use of
military cyber capabilities, both internally in each state and among
allies, can have **negative implications** for **intelligence
activities** and **general network security**]{.underline}. A
conventional military decision to deliver cyber effects is rarely
concerned with maintaining access and staying secret after an effect is
achieved[. Even though it is customary to try to obscure the
vulnerabilities that are being exploited, it is difficult to ensure that
those operating the targeted system or third-party network analysts do
not identify and fix the vulnerabilities in, for example, commercial
products used all over the world]{.underline}. Thus, [military plans to
engage other state entities need to weigh the benefit of delivering
cyber effects against the **risk of losing intelligence capacity**, as
well as the risk that other actors (allies, corporations, adversaries,
criminals, etc.) will use the **same exploits** against
oneself.]{.underline} In other words, [there is a **conflict of
interest** between attack, intelligence collection and internal defence
in **each NATO member state**.]{.underline}42 The desire of the US Cyber
Command to become more independent from the National Security Agency
(NSA) is precisely an attempt to gain a stronger voice when the US
government assesses whether a vulnerability should be disclosed to
vendors, retained for intelligence purposes or used to deliver 'loud'
cyber effects.43

[The risk of confliction among allies arises from the fact that a
similar assessment procedure **does not exist** across
NATO]{.underline}. As conversations with several national
representatives at the CDC reveal, [such a procedure is unlikely to be
agreed upon owing to the different perspectives on offence, defence and
espionage in cyberspace currently prevailing among member
states]{.underline}.44 If the Netherlands, for example, offers to
deliver a 'loud' cyber effect in a NATO operation, British or American
intelligence operations could end up being disturbed because they rely
on the same vulnerabilities which---when used in military
operations---risk being exposed and subsequently fixed.45 When deploying
'loud' cyber effects, malicious actors such as criminals are also given
the opportunity to identify and exploit the same vulnerabilities in
unpatched systems in allied countries. The ransomware incidents known as
WannaCry and NotPetya are examples of the damage that can emerge from
government exploits becoming publicly available---even though the
specific vulnerabilities were already patched by Microsoft and updates
released to supported systems.46

In short, [there is a dilemma both **internally**, between intelligence
agencies and the military, and **externally, between allies**. While it
is difficult to do much about the latter, the internal power dynamics in
most states, with the intelligence agencies as the primary cyber actors,
are likely to limit the willingness of most states to deliver military
cyber effects---whether offensive or defensive---when CYOC makes
requests]{.underline}. They also limit the willingness to share cyber
threat information across the alliance through CYOC.

This section has pointed to three characteristics about cyberspace that
limit the integration of cyber effects in NATO operations. [In a complex
and constantly changing cyberspace, it continues to be difficult to
develop and maintain sophisticated exploits for targeted cyber effects.
This is especially the case if the cyber effects are requested for a
specific time and place in order to guarantee operational success, and
if they simultaneously have to be verifiable and conform to
international legal principles.]{.underline} [Neither the member states,
which face an internal dilemma between attack, intelligence collection
and defence in cyberspace, nor the NATO commander, who will prefer to
control the capabilities used, are likely to feel sufficiently confident
about the targeted or highly integrated cyber effects to choose that
option if other capabilities are available.]{.underline}

**Info-sharing ruins any potential benefits of OCOs.**

Perspective," *CCDCOE*, Available Online at

Policy differences exacerbate conceptual ones. [Allies differ in their
**policy** and **legal constraints**, **strategic cultures**, **threat
perception**, **resources**, **planning** and **budgetary cycles** and
**forces**]{.underline} (Sondhaus, 2006). [While solidarity ultimately
remains NATO's strongest asset, these differences create seams that
**adversaries can exploit**]{.underline}. [This is especially so with
cyberspace, where there is more sensitivity and less commonality to
emerging national approaches than in more established domains, and to
MDO, which is inherently predicated on integration and
interoperability]{.underline} (Sharpy, 2020).

[**Information sharing** is **especially problematic** for the **cyber
dimension** of MDO, with Allies reticent to share details of their
capabilities across NATO given security concerns and political
sensitivities]{.underline}. [The issue of permissions is also a
'**significant challenge** in the development of cyber capabilities',
especially where reconnaissance on Allied soil and networks is required
to detect hostile cyber activity]{.underline} (Watling & Roper, 2019).
[Nations also have **differing policy**, **legal** and **ethical
stances** on key technologies]{.underline} on which MDO relies. [This
includes the use of offensive cyber capabilities or basing of hypersonic
missiles or longrange penetrating fires in Europe, which some fear could
be destabilising and escalatory]{.underline} (Quintin & Vanholme, 2020).
[NATO similarly lacks a common approach to governance and use of AI,
autonomy and automation, all envisaged as essential enablers for JADC2
(Williams, 2020). This affects the levels of autonomy (with the human
in, on or out of the loop) used for sensor data fusion and
decision-making]{.underline}, or to deliver effects using uncrewed
platforms, automated cyber systems and human-machine teaming (Scharre,
2018).

In considering cooperation and burden-sharing, [Allies face **several
dilemmas** depending on their ambitions and resources for both
cyberspace and MDO.]{.underline} The US must overcome domestic
inter-service rivalries and decide how to integrate partners, including
whether it can accept a multinational vision of MDO that is not imposed
on smaller allies---or excludes them entirely, at NATO's expense---but
rather is genuinely collaborative (Watling & Roper, 2019). [Larger
European nations face the dilemma of whether to buy into a US-led
architecture and system-of-systems with implications for freedom of
action, data-sharing and procurement choices, or shoulder the costs of
sovereign or multinational alternatives]{.underline}.11 They also face
choices over how best to contribute to multinational MDO: whether to
aspire to full-spectrum capabilities to allow sovereign action and offer
redundancy to Allies' capabilities or to specialise in certain domains
(e.g. cyber) to offer niche capability and buy leverage with the US and
NATO by making themselves indispensable. [Smaller nations must decide
how to influence larger Allies and NATO, and what to do if they lack
cyber capabilities (or others deemed central to MDO, e.g. long-range
fires) or their forces are too small to operate or gain MDO experience
at echelons above brigade (Watling & Roper, 2019).]{.underline}

[The economic fallout of COVID-19 also raises renewed questions about
**affordability** and the extent to which Allies are **willing** and
**able** to invest in new cyber capabilities]{.underline}---though some
may see these as cost-efficient alternatives to land, air or maritime
forces---and how they time investments in ambitious transformation
programmes such as MDO (Clark, 2020). Timing presents both threats and
opportunities from a cyber perspective. Rapid, hasty transformation
risks undermining NATO cohesion and interoperability or creating
vulnerabilities in JADC2 systems with immature cyber defences (Donaldson
& Sciarini, 2019b). Conversely, overly cautious change risks ceding
ground to adversaries such as Russia and China which are investing
heavily in asymmetric means, including offensive cyber capabilities, to
gain an information advantage over NATO (Kilcullen, 2020).

**NATO will spread info to the private sector --- that causes OCOs to
fail.**

**Black and Lynch 20** --- James Black, Research Coordinator at RAND,
MSc in International Security from Sciences Po, LSE in History from the
University of Cambridge, and Alice Lynch, Former Defense and Security
Analyst at RAND, M.A. in Applied Security Strategy from the University

Perspective," *CCDCOE*, Available Online at
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2020/12/Cyber-Threats-and-NATO-2030_Horizon-Scanning-and-Analysis.pdf)

Problematically, authorities associated with using cyber capabilities
are typically held at the strategic and national level; how tactical or
operational commanders might call upon cyber means as part of future MDO
remains unclear (Nettis, 2020). [Responsibilities for cyberspace also
often fall at least partly to **civilian agencies**, adding the
complexity of **cross-government cooperation**. The private sector's
role developing and applying technologies in the cyber domain (and,
increasingly, space) also **necessitates that NATO work more closely
with industry**, academia and others than for land, maritime or air
operations (Ablon et al., 2019). This presents **operational**,
**policy** and **legal difficulties** for C2, and cybersecurity
challenges associated with reliance on industry-owned
network]{.underline}s, though Allies continue to evolve novel mechanisms
for partnering with industry to address cyber threats (Carr, 2016).

[There is also the question of **tempo**: how to synchronise operations
in cyberspace with the delivery of effects in other domain]{.underline}s
(Reilly, 2020). [Though cyber attacks might initiate in a moment, the
underlying tools and exploits may take **years to develop** and the lead
times and scale of their eventual effect may be difficult to predict or
measure given the difficulties with battle damage assessment in
cyberspace or the EMS]{.underline} (Patrikarakos, 2017; US Joint Staff,
2019). Similarly, [commanders may **lack awareness** or
**understanding** of available cyber instruments and their limitations
and effects compared to more familiar weapons in the physical domains,
limiting inclusion in joint planning and decision-making]{.underline}
(Carbonell, 2017).

**[AT \-\-- Ukraine Cyberwar Now]{.underline}**

**Russia cyber efforts are low-level currently, but the plan changes the
calculus.**

**Kallberg 22** --- Jan Kallberg, Assistant Professor at the United
States Military Academy at West Point, Research Scientist at the Army
Cyber Institute at West Point, PhD in Public Affairs and M.A. in
Political Science from the University of Texas, LLM from Stockholm
University, 2022 ("Ukraine: Russia will not waste offensive cyber
weapons," *The Cyberwire,* March 14^th^, Available Online at

When Russia's strategic calculus would dictate major cyber attacks.

[Russia will use advanced strategic cyber at **well-defined** critical
junctures]{.underline}. For example, as a conflict in Europe unfolded
and dragged in NATO, [Russian forces would seek to delay the entry of
major US forces through cyber attacks against railways, ports, and
electric facilities along the route to the port of
embarkation]{.underline}. If US forces can be delayed by one week, that
is one week of a prolonged time window in Europe before the main US
force arrived, and would enable the submarines of the Northern Fleet to
be positioned in the Atlantic. Strategic cyber supports strategic intent
and actions.

[All cyber-attacks are not the same, and just because an attack
originates from Russia doesn\'t mean it is directed by strategic
intent]{.underline}. Naturally, the Russian regime would allow cyber
vandalism and cybercrime against the West to run rampant, because these
are ways of striking the adversary. [But these low-end activities do not
represent the Russian military complex's cyber capabilities, nor do they
reflect the Russian leadership's strategic intent.]{.underline}

[The recent cyberattacks in Ukraine have been **unsophisticated** and
have had close to no **strategic impact**.]{.underline} [The distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) cyber-attacks are **low-end efforts**, a
nuisance that most corporations already have systems to
mitigate]{.underline}. [Such DDoS attacks will not bring down a country
or force it to submit to foreign will]{.underline}. Such low-end attacks
don't represent advanced offensive cyber weapons: the DDoS attacks are
limited impact cyber vandalism. Advanced offensive cyber weapons
destroy, degrade, and disrupt systems, eradicate trust and pollute data
integrity. DDoS and website defacements are not even close to this in
their effects. By making DDoS attacks, whether it's the state that
carried them out or a group of college students in support of Kremlin
policy, Russia has not shown the extent of its offensive cyber
capability.

The invasion of Ukraine is not the major peer-to-peer conflict that is
the central Russian concern. [The Russians have tailored their advanced
cyber capabilities to directly impact a more significant geopolitical
conflict, one with NATO or China.]{.underline} Creating a national
offensive cyber force is a decades-long investment in training,
toolmaking, reconnaissance of possible avenues of approach, and
detection of vulnerabilities[. If Russia showcased its full range of
advanced offensive cyber capabilities against Ukraine, the Russian
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) would be
compromised]{.underline}. NATO and other neighboring nations, including
China and Iran, would know the extent of Russian capabilities and have
effective insight into Russia's modus operandi.

From a Russian point of view, [if a potential adversary **understood
Russian offensive cyber operations'** tactics, techniques, and
procedures, strategic surprise **would evaporate**, and the Russian
cyber force would **lose the initiative** in a more strategically
significant future conflict]{.underline}.

Understanding the Russian point of view is essential, because it is the
Russians who conduct their offensive actions. This might sound like
stating the obvious, but currently, the prevailing conventional wisdom
is a Western think-tank-driven context, which in my opinion, is
inaccurate. [There is nothing for the Russians to strategically gain by
unleashing their full advanced cyber arsenal against Ukraine or NATO at
this juncture. In an open conflict between Russia and NATO the Russian
calculation would be different and justify use of advanced cyber
capabilities.]{.underline}

**Cyberwar is currently a last resort for Russia.**

**Kallberg 22** --- Jan Kallberg, Assistant Professor at the United
States Military Academy at West Point, Research Scientist at the Army
Cyber Institute at West Point, PhD in Public Affairs and M.A. in
Political Science from the University of Texas, LLM from Stockholm
University, 2022 ("Ukraine: Russia will not waste offensive cyber

<https://thecyberwire.com/stories/75ca5313b59045ccbcbfc7d3b9e5d207/ukraine-russia-will-not-waste-offensive-cyber-weapons>)

[Cyberattacks, in this war, are a **last resort**]{.underline}, not an
opening gambit.

[The lingering threat of offensive cyber operations is Putin's **last
card** -- together with nukes.]{.underline} [There is no rational reason
that Putin's Russia would play the offensive cyber card without some
**reasonable prospect** of **geopolitical gain**.]{.underline}

Russia has achieved an operational stalemate with limited progress in
its invasion of Ukraine, but [unleashing its advanced cyber capabilities
at **this stage** against Western targets will not solve the
war.]{.underline} Such attacks will only increase the support for
Ukraine without bringing Russia any appreciable battlefield advantage

[Western commentaries predicting a Russian cyber onslaught rests upon a
general assumption that sees advanced offensive cyber capabilities as
being replaceable once used]{.underline}. . In reality, [this assumption
is **illogical**: there is no hidden cyber armory from which new weapons
can be fetched and reloaded for continued cyber
bombardment]{.underline}. Exploits, once used, are often parried
quickly, and they can't then be expected to have the same effect they
had when first unleashed.

Therefore, [Russia is **unlikely to waste** its advanced offensive cyber
arsenal on a conflict where there is no value to a cyberattack that
couldn't already be accomplished by kinetic attack]{.underline}: air
strikes, Kalibr cruise missiles, and indirect fire. Each advanced and
sophisticated offensive cyber weapon represents an investment that, in
some cases, is a one-shot ability to exploit a vulnerability. [Striking
targets in America and within NATO utilizing advanced offensive cyber

What are the implications of this for the current Ukraine crisis? [Thus
far, while cyber operations have been used on both sides of the
conflict, they have **not played a decisive role** on the
battlefield.]{.underline} [So far, the United States has been focused on
providing cyber defense support to Ukraine and NATO, reportedly to
include dispatching Cyber Command's cyber mission teams to Eastern
Europe, as well as seeking to deter potential Russian cyber retaliation
in response to U.S. and Western sanctions, especially attacks on U.S.
critical infrastructure]{.underline}.

However, [if the nuclear dimension of the crisis becomes more acute,
policymakers may be tempted to turn to cyber operations to signal
resolve to deter Russia in the nuclear domain]{.underline}. Such an
approach could be seen as particularly appealing precisely because cyber
operations are not kinetic and, therefore, less dangerous than other
military moves. [But this could have the inverse effect of making
**nuclear escalation**, rather than deterrence, **more likely**, for the
following reasons.]{.underline}

In 2020, [Russia clarified its nuclear declaratory policy to state that
Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons under a range of
contingencies, including an adversary attack]{.underline} against
"critical governmental or military sites of the Russian Federation,
disruption of which would undermine nuclear forces' response actions."
Cynthia Roberts has suggested that [this particular scenario "likely
include\[s\] cyber attacks against command and control infrastructure
and/or attempted leadership decapitation.]{.underline}" Similarly,
Dmitry Stefanovich wrote that ["\[t\]here is a wide consensus within the
Russian expert community that this also includes possible cyber threats
as well as other non-nuclear dangers."]{.underline} Interestingly,
Russia's declaratory policy contains parallels to the implicit link
between cyber attacks and nuclear use contained in the 2018 U.S. Nuclear
Posture Review. [That document notes that the United States would
consider using nuclear weapons under "extreme circumstances," including
"significant non-nuclear strategic attacks ... \[such as\] attacks on
U.S. or allied nuclear forces, their command and control, or warning and
attack assessment capabilities."]{.underline}

Therefore, [a hypothetical attempt by the United States to conduct a
cyber operation against Russian nuclear command, control, and
communication systems for signaling purposes, such as to demonstrate
resolve or convey a desire to deter the use of nuclear weapons could in
practice make their use more likely]{.underline}. Unlike most cyber
operations, which rely on secrecy, signals are meant to be seen. And to
be sufficiently credible, this kind of cyber operation would have to
demonstrate an ability to cause a meaningful effect against Russia's
nuclear systems, rather than a low-cost, unsophisticated cyber
operation. [Therefore, assuming such an attack were feasible, the
chances are greater in this scenario that Russia could interpret U.S.
cyber signals as an attack against its critical military
systems.]{.underline}

The problem is that, more often than not, cyber operations are ambiguous
[signals. There is evidence that states can use cyber operations under
some (narrow) conditions to signal a desire to de-escalate international
crises. But these findings do not extend well to nuclear crises where
clarity, rather than uncertainty, is important for
stability]{.underline}. The use of cyber operations to defuse crises
have involved cyber signaling short of war, not during an ongoing
conventional conflict involving nuclear powers. And they have not
involved cyber operations targeting a state's nuclear command and
control where states, like Russia, have already staked out declaratory
policies. [Moreover, states are still at a nascent stage in developing
shared indices to inform assessments of intent in cyberspace, especially
when it comes to cyber operations in nuclear crises.]{.underline}

Therefore, [even if Russia would not take the cataclysmic step of
escalating to the first use of nuclear weapons in response to a U.S.
cyber operation, it could misinterpret U.S. signaling efforts and take
measures to make nuclear use]{.underline} easier (such as making
warheads operational, dispersing forces, pre-delegating authority, or
increasing automaticity). [These readiness measures could increase the
chances of **inadvertent** or even **accidental
escalation**.]{.underline}
