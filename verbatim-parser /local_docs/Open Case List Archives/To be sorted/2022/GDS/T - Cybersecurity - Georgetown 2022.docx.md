\'\'Training to operate in a degraded environment is now regularly built
into our exercises, and our service members are quickly becoming aware
of our cyber vulnerabilities,\'\' the secretary said. But [winning in
cyberspace requires an offensive strategy]{.underline}, Esper told the
summit audience. [\'\'We need to do more than just play goal line
defense]{.underline},\'\' he said. \'\'As such[, the department\'s 2018
Cyber Strategy articulates a proactive and assertive approach to defend
forward of our own virtual boundaries.]{.underline} \'\'Just as we do on
land, at sea, and in the air, we must posture our forces in cyberspace
where we can most effectively accomplish our mission,\'\' he continued.
[\'\'Defending forward allows us to disrupt threats at the initial
source before they reach our networks and systems. To do this, we must
be in a position to continuously compete with the ongoing campaigns
being waged against the United States]{.underline}. Not only does [this
protects us day-to-day,]{.underline} but enacting this strategy builds
the readiness of our cyber warriors so they have the tools, skills and
experience needed to succeed in conflict.\'\'

#### C/I: Cybersecurity can be offensive or defensive---there's no relevant brightline

[Governments and corporations have realized that a passive, defensive
approach to cybersecurity has limited success]{.underline}. Instead,
there is [growing recognition of the need for persistent engagement that
infiltrates and degrades an attacker's systems and
infrastructure]{.underline}. Also known as hacking back[, offensive
cybersecurity operations refer to the proactive attack on hackers to
cripple or disrupt their operations and deter future attacks. Offensive
cybersecurity has the advantage of stopping or preempting cyberattacks
before they impair target systems or penetrate
cyber-defenses]{.underline}. The operations can also introduce
uncertainty in an attacker in addition to influencing their behavior.

#### Prefer our definition\-\--

#### [Limits]{.underline}\-\--it [excludes]{.underline} actions that tangentially affect cyber security, requiring a [direct framework]{.underline} for cyber security operations: OFFENSIVE or DEFENSIVE.

#### [Ground]{.underline}\-\--[overarching NATO]{.underline} governance guarantees [large]{.underline} change, ensuring [link uniqueness]{.underline}

#### Their ground arg is terrible -- require them to name specific das and counterplan that offensive rather than defensive cyber security spikes out of.

#### Predictability -- Their interp isn't exclusive all cybersecurity operations can technically be considered defensive🡪 "defending forward" see our we meet arg above

#### Functional limits check -- NATO Withdrawal CP & NATO turns ensure neg always has ground. The neg ran multiple turns specific to our aff and DAs with direct links - solves any abuse.

#### Reasonability over competing interps \-\-- solves race to the bottom and arbitrary limits.

**W/M Ext: OCO's are active defense.**

Affairs and an ACP Chapter member in United States Army and Air Force.

Additionally, \"active [defense measures]{.underline}\" [are
often]{.underline} another term [used to define and refer to offensive
cyber operations (OCOs]{.underline}) or computer network attacks (CNAs).
[Some have defined active defenses as including of deception or
honeypots]{.underline}, which seek to confuse attackers with traps and
advanced forensics. Examples of such honeypot technologies include
Illusive Networks, TrapX, Cymmetria, Attivo, and others. Other types of
active defenses might include automated incident response, which
attempts to tie together different response strategies in order to
increase work for attackers and decrease work for defenders. [The
Department of Defense defines active defense as: \"The employment of
limited offensive action and counterattacks to deny a contested area or
position to the enemy.\"\[12\]]{.underline} This [definition does not
specify whether it refers to physical actions, or cyber-related
actions.]{.underline} Recently, the Department of Homeland Security and
financial institutions have identified Active Defense as a top priority
for security industrial infrastructure systems. As part of a broader
push for greater resiliency, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology 800-160 Volume 2 framework has gone further, providing
guidance on standardization for active defense.

...[This capability can be required to guarantee one\'s freedom of
action in the cyber domain]{.underline}. [Cyber-attacks can be launched
to repel an attack (active defense) or to support the operational
action. The distinction between active cyber defense and offensive cyber
operations (OCO) is that the later requires legislative exceptions or
executive prerogative to undertake. Hence, offensive cyber capabilities
may be developed in collaboration with industry, or facilitated by
private sector but operations are led by nation states.]{.underline}
There are some exceptions, notably in self-defense or with judicial
authority (civil warrants) or assisting law enforcement.

#### C/I Ext : cybersecurity is offensive and defensive.

As ransomware attacks continue to increase and cybercriminals are
becoming more sophisticated, [the federal government has implemented a
more proactive approach when it comes to cybersecurity]{.underline}. As
evidenced by [its stated strategy to adopt a [zero trust
architecture](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2022/01/26/office-of-management-and-budget-releases-federal-strategy-to-move-the-u-s-government-towards-a-zero-trust-architecture/),
the federal government is taking measures to reduce the risk of
cyberattacks against its digital infrastructure, and setting specific
security goals for agencies to quickly detect, isolate and respond to
threats]{.underline}. This approach is also exemplified by the
[extension of its [Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity
Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-expands-public-private-cybersecurity-partnership-to-water-sector/)]{.underline},
which is [aimed at facilitating the deployment of technologies and
systems that provide cyber-related threat visibility, indicators,
detections and warnings to the water infrastructure]{.underline}.

An [offensive mindset is key to ensuring the best cyber
defense]{.underline}. To ensure success, there are [three main
components for organizations to consider when developing a defensive
strategy based on an offensive cyber model]{.underline}: re-envisioning
recruitment, thinking like a hacker, and promoting offensive training in
tangent with defensive training.

### Standards\-\--Not Much Lit

#### Security coop receives little attention

University of San Francisco, 12/12/11,
<https://repository.usfca.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=thes>

[The]{.underline} **[lit]{.underline}**erature **[review]{.underline}**
[will establish]{.underline} the premise [that **security
coop**]{.underline}eration [as an **academic area of study** receives
**little attention**]{.underline}.17 [The]{.underline} **[paucity of
literature]{.underline}** [on the subject contributes to]{.underline}
the current **[misunderstanding]{.underline}** of the definition [as
well as]{.underline} its **[improper strategic
utilization]{.underline}**. Authors who participate in scholarly
conversation on the topic fall into one of two categories, doctrinal use
or modern misconception.18 The contradictory nature of the literature
further supports my hypothesis that the definition of security
cooperation is frequently not applied in Afghanistan.

#### Even so the lit is on our side, the USFG's main form of cybersecurity strategies are OCO's (offense/defending forward).

#### Hon, Lamar, Smith et al. '16, "*COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND TECHNOLOGY*," p. 118 1/8/2016.

To follow up on Mr. Swalwell's question, he was [talking about being on
offense and the prosecution]{.underline}, but [from the technology side,
is it all defensive or are there proactive ways to combat hackers before
they make their attack?]{.underline} Mr. SCHNEIDER. I mean, I think
[there's a set of approaches that are not defensive and are much more
proactive that are in place today and will continue to
expand]{.underline}. So [one example is around things like honey
pots]{.underline}, so if the bad guys are attacking you and you give
them a place that looks like a legitimate part of your infrastructure
that they go to and spend all of their time and energy attacking, [you
protect your real assets and you're able to study what they're doing at
the same time.]{.underline} There's [also]{.underline} things like
[shock absorbers]{.underline} where the harder an attacker hits you with
traffic, the more you slow them down and do things like tar pitting. So
[there's a whole set I think of defensive and more proactive defensive
measures that aren't offensive, don't go directly after the attackers
that are in place today and are actually very successful within the
enterprise.]{.underline}

### A2 deterrence by denial vs. punishment

#### NATO uses both deterrence by denial & punishment- distinction is irrelevant in this context.

a former NATO employee. "NATO Review - On Deterrence" *NATO Review*,

<https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2016/08/05/on-deterrence/index.html>

[Deterrence is a relatively simple idea: one actor persuades another
actor -- a would-be aggressor -- that an aggression would incur a
cost]{.underline}, possibly in the form of unacceptable damage, [which
would far outweigh any potential gain, material or
political]{.underline}. [The involvement of at least two actors makes
deterrence a complicated social interaction]{.underline}. It is very
much about human nature, psychology and basic human emotions: fear,
courage, trust, lust for power, and revenge. [Elevate all this to the
level of state actors]{.underline}, with all the intricacies inherent in
statehood and statesmanship, add the stakes of national survival, add
nuclear weapons to the mix[, and deterrence becomes a highly complex,
volatile, intangible, but also combustible concept]{.underline}. [From
deterrence by denial to denial of deterrence -- and back.]{.underline}
During the Cold War[, NATO pursued deterrence by punishment and
deterrence by denial]{.underline}. [Deterrence by punishment was based
on the notion of 'unactable damages',]{.underline} including through
massive nuclear retaliation for any Soviet attack -- conventional or
nuclear[. Deterrence by denial was about making it physically difficult
for the aggressor to achieve his objective, which NATO pursued through
forward defense]{.underline} at its eastern border with the Soviet
Union.
