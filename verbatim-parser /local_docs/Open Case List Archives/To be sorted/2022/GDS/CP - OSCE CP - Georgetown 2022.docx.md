Strengthening human control: the role of the OSCE

[Reaching a common position on weaponised AI regulation is challenging.
The current global]{.underline} and European [political atmosphere is
one of distrust, particularly between]{.underline} two [major European
security players: Russia and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. In June 2021 both President Joe Biden and
President Vladimir Putin said that the bilateral relationship "has
deteriorated to its lowest point in recent years".34 [There is also
distrust of technologies such as the Internet, AI, 5G, and robotics, not
least because they can be weaponised]{.underline} and used for
threatening activities such as cyber attacks. [This environment makes it
difficult to attain a common understanding]{.underline} [and commit to
agreed principles]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the [use]{.underline}
[of weaponised AI. Nevertheless, the OSCE]{.underline}
[possesses]{.underline} some [key advantages]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} could [make it the platform for taking a step forward
in the global debate]{.underline}.

Just like the CCW, [the OSCE operates by consensus, which requires it to
seek a compromise]{.underline} among participating States on whatever
issue is being discussed. [However, the organisation has been
historically known for its ambition to form an inclusive security
community and to build practices that "suggest a new model of
international security" that is "comprehensive", "indivisible", and
"cooperative".]{.underline}35 [The OSCE's predecessor]{.underline}, the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, [was a symbol of
détente]{.underline} [between the United States and the Soviet Union,
and a place for two rivals to find compromise]{.underline} [on security
issues, demonstrating the possibility of coexistence on the European
continent]{.underline}.36 [The OSCE has not only been able to survive,
but also to adapt to the rising security challenges of the new world
order. Its broad membership]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[comprehensive]{.underline} [approach to security make it]{.underline} a
key -- if not [the]{.underline} [most]{.underline} -- [legitimate
institution for European security]{.underline}.37 [At a time when some
experts debate whether Russian-US relations have entered a new cold war,
the OSCE's inclusive approach]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
[needed]{.underline} [to show that tensions can be dealt with in a forum
rather than on the battlefield.]{.underline}

[Other international institutions have demonstrated their
ambitions]{.underline} to create some form of AI regulation. In April
2021 the European Commission presented its legal framework proposal,
which could lay down a path towards defining a regional approach to
governing weaponised AI.38 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}) [has]{.underline} [also]{.underline} [set out its
principles for the responsible use of AI in the area of
defence]{.underline}.39 [The]{.underline} key [difference]{.underline}
[is that these institutions have favoured exclusive]{.underline}
[membership in terms of which prospective countries need to fulfil
specific conditions to join. However, the OSCE has
relatively]{.underline} [broad]{.underline} [accession rules because it
was initially based on the concept of geopolitical
diversity]{.underline}.40 [Settling the differences]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [misunderstandings]{.underline} [between]{.underline}
different actors, especially [Russia]{.underline} [and the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [is]{.underline} a
[key]{.underline} step [in achieving a]{.underline} [security
agreement]{.underline} [such as a commitment to human
control]{.underline} [over weaponised AI.]{.underline} [In recent years
the Russian discourse has expressed disappointment]{.underline} [that
Western countries have made]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} [the main
European security organisation.]{.underline}41 [By engaging with Russia
on the issue of weaponised AI]{.underline} [within the]{.underline}
[OSCE]{.underline} framework, [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would contribute to]{.underline}
[easing]{.underline} the [tensions]{.underline} between it
[and]{.underline} Russia, while also [diminishing]{.underline} the
[chances of]{.underline} [misunderstanding]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [misinterpretation. The OSCE's]{.underline} [inclusive
membership]{.underline} [is]{.underline} thus [a]{.underline} [valuable
advantage]{.underline} [in terms of building trust and mitigating the
security implications of modern technologies]{.underline}.42

What should be the way forward? In the 2019 Luxembourg Declaration on
Advancing Sustainable Development to Promote Security, the OSCE
Parliamentary Assembly urged "participating States to support
international negotiations to ban lethal autonomous weapons with a view
to establishing international, legally binding rules".43 [A legally
binding treaty banning the development of weaponised AI would be
challenging]{.underline}, [given that]{.underline}, unlike nuclear
weapons or blinding lasers, [AI is not a specific type of weapon and can
also be applied for civilian use]{.underline}.44 Some participating
States hold the position that a ban will affect the development of
useful civilian technology. Within the framework of the CCW, [Russia has
argued that banning LAWS too hastily could "hinder technological
progress",]{.underline}45 while the UK government believes that "a
legally binding instrument which hampers the legitimate development and
use of such technologies would be counterproductive".46

[As a realistic starting point, the OSCE's]{.underline} confidence- and
securitybuilding measures ([CSBMs]{.underline}) [could provide a
framework to exchange information and observations]{.underline} [on the
use of weaponised AI, in order to facilitate communication and
dialogue]{.underline}.47 The OSCE already has CSBMs for information
communication technologies, which, like weaponised AI, create "an area
with much room for speculation, doubt, and ambiguity" and "increase the
potential for tensions between States".48 There is also the potential to
go further than exchanging information informally within the CSBMs
framework.

Based on the recommendations of the International Panel on the
Regulation of Autonomous Weapons, [the]{.underline} [next]{.underline}
[step should be to "focus on the obligation to maintain]{.underline}
[human control]{.underline} [over the use of force", which would "apply
to all conventional weapons]{.underline}".49 [Taking this path will
avoid the debate on defining LAWS, which has been hindering]{.underline}
the [progress]{.underline} of the CCW discussions. In 2019 the GGE on
LAWS adopted a set of guiding principles that are broad, have no legally
binding force and do not clarify the concept of human control, only
stating that "human responsibility for decisions on the use of weapons
systems must be retained since accountability cannot be transferred to
machines".50 [While OSCE member States accept in principle the
importance of human control, they have until now not been able to agree
on a common definition]{.underline} of this concept. [The commitment to
human control should be enshrined in a normative framework such as a
political declaration]{.underline} [or]{.underline} a [manual of best
practices]{.underline}. [Any such document would already be a step
forward]{.underline}. It could be part of the Vienna Document or the
result of a new OSCE working group.

Importantly, [an OSCE political declaration or guide]{.underline} on
human control and weaponised AI [would]{.underline} [not
undermine]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [negate]{.underline} [the
efforts at the CCW but would build on them]{.underline}. [Shifting the
discussion towards the current impacts of weaponised AI rather than the
potential future impact of "killer robots" would help to mitigate the
risks inherent in these technologies. It would demonstrate that finding
consensus]{.underline}, especially [in an atmosphere of]{.underline}
[political distrust]{.underline}, [is]{.underline}
[possible]{.underline}. [While debates at the CCW continue]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} [operational]{.underline} [trend towards further
autonomy]{.underline} [in the armed forces of OSCE participating States
is a reality]{.underline}. [Practices related to the use of weaponised
AI have the potential to shape warfare norms]{.underline}. [Yet
this]{.underline} trajectory [is]{.underline} [not
inevitable]{.underline}, and [with the right approach, a political
declaration containing a common definition of human control would be a
realistic achievement]{.underline}.

A political declaration should therefore contain a commitment to
retaining human control over AI-driven weapons systems. [This would be a
crucial step towards addressing regional security threats and creating
an international framework on weaponised AI]{.underline}. The history
and membership of the OSCE make it the most appropriate organisation to
build trust and take a key step forward on weaponised AI when global
discussion at the UN is stalling and operational trends continue to
increase the use of autonomous weapons systems.

Conclusion

[Current practices related to the use of weaponised AI are already
impacting European stability and security]{.underline}. Operational
trends that reflect a reduction in the level of human control over
weapons with increasingly autonomous features pose significant legal,
ethical and security risks. Moreover, [the lack of definition of LAWS
and agreement on an appropriate level of human control among states
creates uncertainty and potential misinterpretation]{.underline}.
[However, the trajectory of AI is not permanently set to be an "arms
race".]{.underline} [Finding a common agreement]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} a [challenging]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} [not
impossible]{.underline} task. [The OSCE is a promising platform to build
on]{.underline} the [stalled discussions]{.underline} at the CCW,
[because it has a history of acting as a bridge]{.underline} [between
various perspectives of European security. It is an inclusive
organisation]{.underline} that brings together the key developers of
weaponised AI and players in European security. [By debating this issue
at the OSCE]{.underline} and agreeing on a political declaration
containing a commitment to human control, [participating States will
address some of the risks of autonomous weapons systems and demonstrate
the relevance of the OSCE in tackling the impact of modern technologies
and their use in conventional weapons.]{.underline}

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine risks incapacitating]{.underline} one of
the only remaining multilateral spaces for cooperation between Russia
and the West, [the]{.underline} Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe ([OSCE]{.underline}). Participating states must
work to prevent this outcome and preserve the OSCE's critical role in
containing conflicts.

Russia's 24 February invasion of Ukraine has sent shock waves through
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a body
that has been instrumental in containing conflicts that erupted after
the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russia's actions in Ukraine are a
glaring violation of the OSCE's commitment to respecting sovereignty,
territorial integrity and human rights, memorialised in its founding
principles. They have poisoned the atmosphere at [the
organisation]{.underline}'s seat in Vienna -- which [hosts]{.underline}
the [57 participating states, including]{.underline} [Ukraine and
Russia]{.underline} [as well as]{.underline} [all]{.underline} European
Union ([EU]{.underline}) [and]{.underline} North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) [members]{.underline} -- and
compromised its ability to take decisions on matters big and small.

But [for all the challenges it faces, the OSCE]{.underline}
[remains]{.underline} an [essential]{.underline} forum. [It is one of
the only remaining multilateral spaces outside the UN]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} [dialogue between Russia and the West]{.underline}; in
the words of an OSCE official, [the organisation has been]{.underline}
"sort of [an]{.underline} [airbag]{.underline} [that opens]{.underline}
[any time we face]{.underline} echoes of [tensions]{.underline}" between
Russia and the West. [The OSCE is one of the few international
organisations]{.underline} [with the potential to play an important role
in implementing any]{.underline} [ceasefire]{.underline} arrangement
[that]{.underline} the [conflict parties might reach in
Ukraine]{.underline}, where prior to the war's current phase it led a
sizeable monitoring mission. [It]{.underline} also [helps manage the
risk of escalation in conflicts from]{.underline} [Moldova]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [Georgia]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [Central
Asia.]{.underline}

[Governments]{.underline} [should do all they can]{.underline} [to
prevent]{.underline} the [OSCE's incapacitation]{.underline}. Russia
must refrain from holding the OSCE hostage and letting core operations
collapse. Western states, in turn, should resist pushing for Russia's
suspension from the OSCE. Suspension would likely lead Russia to
withdraw, as it did on 15 March from the Council of Europe.

The OSCE in Ukraine

With roots that date back to the 1970s, the OSCE assumed its current
institutional form in 1994 as a forum for peace, stability and democracy
issues. It runs fifteen field operations that perform a range of tasks,
from monitoring conflict situations and violence prevention to promoting
governance reform.

Even before recent events, Ukraine was an important theatre for the
OSCE. In 2014, following Russia's annexation of Crimea and the onset of
a Russia-backed separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, the OSCE
mounted a far-reaching response. It deployed a monitoring mission -- one
of the largest field operations in its history -- that served as eyes
and ears on the ground and helped to reduce violence along the line of
separation between government-controlled Ukraine and the separatist
entities in Donetsk and Luhansk. When Russia's invasion began on 24
February, that mission still had close to 500 international monitors on
the ground and continued its reporting as evacuation commenced. The
mission has now essentially paused activities, although some Ukrainian
staff remain present to carry out limited office functions in some
locations.

Aside from monitoring, the OSCE acted as a mediator bringing together
Russia, Ukraine and the de facto entities in eastern Ukraine within the
so-called Trilateral Contact Group. The negotiations failed to settle
the conflict in line with the 2014 and 2015 Minsk Agreements, which
brought the war's first phase of major fighting to a halt. But they did
broker truces, for example in July 2020, which led to a marked reduction
in hostilities. The talks also helped improve the situation of the
civilian population in the areas affected by the conflict in eastern
Ukraine, for example by enabling civilians to cross the line of
separation.

The framework for these mediation efforts no longer exists. Russia's
recognition of the de facto separatist entities, and its 24 February
invasion, have rendered meaningless the Minsk Agreements, which foresaw
the reintegration of Donetsk and Luhansk with Ukraine. The OSCE still
has a special representative for Ukraine, Mikko Kinnunen, who was the
main mediator within the Trilateral Contact Group, but his role is
unclear at this point.

Since the start of the war, Poland, which chairs the organisation in
2022, has suspended all regular business, holding meetings only of two
political bodies -- the Permanent Council and the Forum for Security
Cooperation -- which were entirely dedicated to Ukraine. These meetings
featured strongly worded condemnations of Russia and coordinated
walkouts. Along similar lines, in the annual address of the OSCE
Chair-in-Office at the UN Security Council on 14 March, Polish Foreign
Minister Zbigniew Rau likened Russia's actions in Ukraine to "state
terrorism".

Beyond symbolic acts, the OSCE has only a handful of available tools for
responding to the war in Ukraine, given the polarisation among its
participating states and its convention of operating by consensus. On 3
March, it mandated a fact-finding expert group to collect information
about violations of human rights and international humanitarian law
committed during the war. But this enquiry will be limited, as the group
has to submit its report within a few weeks. Another tangible and
important step it might take would be to preserve the OSCE's monitoring
mission in Ukraine, whose mandate expires at the end of the month.
Participating states will shortly commence negotiations, but it is
questionable they will extend the mission's mandate as doing so would
require Russia and Ukraine to agree. Absent consensus, they can and
should at least agree to "hibernating" it, rather than shutting it down
completely. Hibernation would mean preserving the mission as a legal
entity and maintaining core administrative functions, even as its
operations remain paused. In the event of a ceasefire, hibernation would
allow for rapid reactivation, saving precious time. Another, though less
likely, possibility is that a reactivated OSCE monitoring mission could
serve as a stopgap until the deployment of a more robust UN or hybrid
UN-OSCE peacekeeping mission.

When it comes to diplomatic engagement, the OSCE is unlikely to serve as
the main mediator aiming to broker a settlement between Russia and
Ukraine, given that Poland -- which has an especially tense relationship
with Moscow -- now holds the chair. But the OSCE special representative
for Ukraine could use his good offices to address specific issues, for
example facilitating agreements on humanitarian access.

Beyond Ukraine

In countries [beyond Ukraine, the OSCE continues to play a]{.underline}
[crucial conflict management role. A prime example is]{.underline}
[Georgia]{.underline}, whose two breakaway regions -- Abkhazia and South
Ossetia -- Russia has recognised as independent states. Since the 2008
war between Russia and Georgia, [the OSCE has acted as one of three
international mediators, along with the EU and the UN]{.underline}.
Together, [the trio are responsible for organising the Geneva
International Discussions, a negotiating format that brings together
Georgia]{.underline}, the [de facto entities, Russia and
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [The
talks]{.underline} in Geneva [have kept]{.underline} [communication
channels open]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [helped]{.underline}
[address incidents]{.underline} [that otherwise could]{.underline} have
[escalate]{.underline}d.

In South Ossetia, the OSCE's role has been particularly important. Much
less visible than the EU, which runs a 200-person monitoring mission on
the territory controlled by the Georgian government, the OSCE is
considered an acceptable interlocutor by Russia and the allied de facto
leadership in South Ossetia. The OSCE has therefore been able to broker
deals, for example on water supply and access to farm land, which have
reduced the risk of violence and improved the lives of people on both
sides of the line of separation.

[The]{.underline} [Ukraine war]{.underline} [risks]{.underline}
[reopening wounds]{.underline} from 2008 [and could]{.underline}
[upend]{.underline} the [OSCE's diplomatic efforts]{.underline}. Both
breakaway regions have demonstrated strong support for Russia's actions
in Ukraine, while Georgia, although not joining sanctions against
Russia, has still sent in an application for EU membership and voted to
condemn Russia's aggression within international institutions. These
developments could have an impact on prospects for future cooperation
and even on negotiation formats that have helped keep these conflict
zones stable for over a decade. A worrying sign is that the UN, EU and
OSCE co-chairs decided to cancel the forthcoming round of the Geneva
talks scheduled at the end of March, following postponement of their
pre-talks visit to the region and to Russia. [The absence
of]{.underline} [regular talks]{.underline} [undermines]{.underline}
[the OSCE's ability to act as a]{.underline} [mediator]{.underline}
[just when its role as a go-between may be]{.underline} [most
needed]{.underline} [to maintain communication between the conflict
parties and help address incidents]{.underline} [that could]{.underline}
[spark violence]{.underline}.

[In]{.underline} [Moldova, the OSCE plays an important role, too, acting
as a]{.underline} [mediator]{.underline} [between the Moldovan
government and de facto authorities in separatist Transdniestria. Its
work has helped]{.underline} [contain the conflict]{.underline},
stabilising the situation in a country that is vulnerable to being
inflamed by tensions between Russia and the West. Likewise, the OSCE
runs field operations in the Western Balkans and in Central Asia that
perform local conflict management functions and aim to promote
governance reforms, though the results in each place vary.

The Need to Preserve the OSCE

The deepening rift between Russia and the West threatens the OSCE's very
functioning. As noted, [the organisation requires consensus]{.underline}
[to take decisions]{.underline}, which in effect bestows veto power on
all participating states. [The war in]{.underline} [Ukraine]{.underline}
[risks]{.underline} [not only paralysing]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[OSCE]{.underline} [but also]{.underline} [unravelling its core
operations]{.underline}. For example, absent agreement among
participating states, the OSCE's field operations, which work to advance
stability and governance reforms across the region, will collapse as
they require annual mandate extensions. [It is both]{.underline}
[possible and essential]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [avoid this
scenario]{.underline}.

Russia bears the primary responsibility. It must refrain from holding
the OSCE hostage and letting core operations fall apart.
[Western]{.underline} states also need to do their part. Their
[diplomats]{.underline} in Vienna [need to find ways of]{.underline}
[engaging Russia]{.underline} [and seeking]{.underline} [pragmatic
cooperation, even if it is]{.underline} [difficult to do so in the face
of an escalating war]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [rides roughshod
over OSCE principles. They should]{.underline} [refrain from pushing
Russia out of the organisation]{.underline} via the "consensus minus
one" rule, which states invoked in the early 1990s to temporarily
exclude the former Yugoslavia on the grounds of massive human rights
violations. Using this rule to suspend Russia from the OSCE would be
both ineffective and dangerous -- ineffective because even if Russia
were excluded, its close ally Belarus could still block decisions, and
dangerous because it would probably lead to Russia's withdrawal, as it
did in the Council of Europe. [Russia's]{.underline}
[exclusion]{.underline} [would]{.underline} likely [spell the
end]{.underline} [of the organisation's ability to mediate in its
neighbourhood, jeopardising]{.underline} [its]{.underline} [conflict
management role]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [Bosnia, Moldova, Georgia,
Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [various Central Asian
states]{.underline}. These are [precisely the areas]{.underline} [that
may now experience increased tensions]{.underline}, as parties come
under political pressure from Moscow and the West to take sides.

[Moreover, over the long term in Ukraine, the OSCE could come to
play]{.underline} [an]{.underline} [important role]{.underline}
[if]{.underline} [Moscow and Kyiv]{.underline} [come to a
compromise]{.underline} on a ceasefire or settlement. The existing
monitoring mission could be repurposed to help oversee a ceasefire
agreement, shedding light on violations and facilitating dialogue
between the parties. It could also be deployed to monitor specific
agreements, for example ones reached to ensure the safety of nuclear
power plants in Ukraine. The OSCE High Commissioner on National
Minorities could help find creative compromises related to the place of
the Russian language in Ukraine, long a controversial issue, and OSCE
election observers could be deployed in the event of post-war elections
in Ukraine. [However far off such issues may seem in the face of an
escalating war, they will be among the issues the parties will have to
grapple with when the fighting stops]{.underline}.

[All of these are reasons not to burn the bridge between Russia and the
West that the OSCE represents, even as it faces the most serious threat
since its creation]{.underline}. [Participating states should work to
ensure the OSCE's continued functioning, preserving]{.underline} its
[precious remaining space for]{.underline} [pragmatic
cooperation]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [international security
matters]{.underline} in Europe. They must also try to shield [the OSCE's
work]{.underline} beyond Ukraine -- in places like Moldova, Georgia and
Bosnia, where it helps to keep communication channels open, promote
dialogue and resolve incidents that could spark violence. These efforts
have helped lower tensions for years, and they [are]{.underline} [all
the more valuable]{.underline} [now that the fallout of the war in
Ukraine creates]{.underline} [fresh escalation risks]{.underline}.

Триггером послужили события в и вокруг Ук­ раины 2013-2014 гг., когда
Украина и ЕС обсуж­ дали подписание соглашения об ассоциации этой страны
с Евросоюзом, результатом чего явился сначала мирный, а затем
вооруженный Майдан, российская операция по присоединению Крыма и
развитие событий на юго-востоке Украины. Россия и Запад по-разному
оценивают причины сегодняш­ него кризиса: Россия считает, что Запад
перешел Рубикон, когда поддержал вооруженное свержение законного режима
Януковича после того, как пред­ ставители трех стран Евросоюза дали ему
гарантии безопасности; Запад считает, что Россия перешла Рубикон, когда
нарушила Будапештский меморан­ дум 1994 г., являясь одним из трех
гарантов терри­ ториальной целостности Украины в обмен на отказ последней
от ядерного оружия, а затем вмешалась в развитие событий на юго-востоке
этой страны.

Различная трактовка причин кризиса приводит к тому, что ни одна из
сторон не готова «посту­ питься принципами» и начать серьезный разговор
об основах новой разрядки. На наших глазах про­ исходит дальнейшая
эскалация. В рамках острей­ шей информационной войны обе стороны исполь­
зуют любые средства, дабы подорвать репутацию друг друга, и как бы
исключают возможности для будущих договоренностей.

Вместе с тем по линии взаимодействия с инсти­ тутами - НАТО, ЕС, ОБСЕ,
Совет Европы - на протяжении ряда кризисных лет наблюдалась оп­
ределенная сдержанность.

Россия - НАТО. 1 апреля 2014 г. в ответ на дейст­ вия России в Крыму НАТО
приостановила все виды практического сотрудничества по линии Совета Рос­
сия - НАТО, аргументируя свою позицию тем, что «бизнес как прежде
невозможен». Вместе с тем, работа самого Совета не была заморожена; за
период с 2014 по 2018 г. он собирался несколько раз на уровне послов.
Следует отметить, однако, что послы обменивались взаимными обвинениями,
и результаты заседаний были практически нулевыми. Решения Уэльского
саммита Альянса (сентябрь 2014 г.) свиде­ тельствовали о том, что НАТО от
отражения новых угроз вернулась к истокам - к обеспечению коллек­ тивной
обороны. В декларации по итогам саммита отмечалось, что план действий по
готовности НАТО (НАТО Кеабте88 АеТюп Р1ап) отвечал «на изменения среды
безопасности на границах Альянса» и на «вы­ зовы, порожденные Россией и
их стратегические последствия»2. План предполагал постоянное присут­
ствие триады вооруженных сил и существенную военную активность НАТО в
восточной зоне на по­ тенциальной основе.

Варшавский саммит Альянса 2016 г. продемон­ стрировал готовность
трансатлантических союзни-ков пойти на символическое укрепление (в виде
четырех батальонов по 1 тыс. человек каждый) оборонных структур на
восточном направлении, но неготовность пожертвовать Основополагающим
Актом Россия - НАТО 1997 г., на чем настаивал ряд стран Центральной и
Восточной Европы (речь шла о том положении ОА, где говорилось об отказе
НАТО от постоянного размещения существенных боевых сил в новых районах
базирования)1.

В начале 2018 г. генсек Альянса Столтенберг даже сделал заявление,
согласно которому он при­ звал союзников учитывать тот факт, что они
имеют дело с «более самоуверенной Россией». «Мы не хотели бы повторения
холодной войны и гонки вооружений, мы выступаем за политический диалог с
Москвой»2. В начале 2018 г. начальник Генераль­ ного штаба МО РФ Г.
Герасимов посетил штаб- квартиру НАТО и вел переговоры с официальными
военными представителями Альянса, в ходе кото­ рых затрагивались такие
вопросы, как ситуация в Украине, в Афганистане, транспарентность военной
деятельности и снижение рисков военных столкно­ вений (здесь следует
отметить, что только в 2016 г. в регионе Балтийского моря произошло
более 60 военных инцидентов в воздушном пространстве между самолетами РФ
и стран НАТО).

Россия и НАТО проявляют так называемую стратегическую сдержанность:
Россия - когда не размещает дополнительные военные контингенты в
Псковской и Калининградской областях (кроме систем ПВО), НАТО - когда не
хочет выходить из ОА РФ - НАТО и размещать существенные воору­ женные
силы на восточном фланге.

Безусловно, в краткосрочной и среднесрочной перспективе России и НАТО
вряд ли удастся вер­ нуться к тому уровню сотрудничества, который су­
ществовал в 2000-е годы, когда в рамках СРН было создано 25 рабочих
групп, включая совместное миро­ творчество и создание ПРО европейского
ТВД.

Особенно в условиях, когда российский МИД в середине апреля 2019 г.
объявил о решении о пол­ ном разрыве отношений между Россией и НАТО по
военной и гражданской линиям. За этим решением, вероятно, стояло
осознание тупиковости сохране­ ния видимости отношений, понимание того,
что на самом деле несмотря на определенную риторику со стороны
представителей Альянса, реальных наме­ рений и подготовки к военному
конфликту НАТО не ведет, надежды на то, что реалистичнее догова­ риваться
с США, а не со значительным количест­ вом их европейских союзников, ряд
из которых настроены категорически антироссийски.

Представляется, что как решение НАТО от 1 апреля 2014 г., так и решение
России от апреля 2019 г. не являются оптимальными. Во-первых, потому,
что именно в периоды кризисов надо оста­ваться за столом переговоров, а
не захлопывать двери. Во-вторых, потому, что отсутствие каналов
оперативного взаимодействия между военными может привести к инцидентам
как в воздушном, так и морском пространстве в районе Балтии, где
самолеты и корабли стран НАТО и РФ встречаются достаточно часто. В этом
контексте хочется наде­ яться на то, что сохраняются хотя бы неформаль­
ные контакты между военными.

Ни у России, ни у НАТО нет намерений эскала­ ции кризиса и трансформации
его в реальную во­ енную конфронтацию, несмотря на достаточно жесткую
пропагандистскую риторику с обеих сто­ рон в рамках ведущейся
информационной войны.

Геополитическая неопределенность, характери­ зующая нынешний этап
мирового развития и отно­ шения по линии Россия - Запад, является не
самым лучшим фоном для возможности какого-либо пози­ тивного развития на
треке Россия - НАТО. Вместе с тем не следует забывать, что Альянс не
переводит в практическую плоскость вопрос об интеграции Гру­ зии и
Украины, что означало бы готовность к воен­ ной конфронтации с Россией.
Россия, понимая, что военный бюджет Альянса в 20 с лишним раз превос­
ходит военные расходы РФ, также не имеет намере­ ний развивать
конфликтный потенциал отношений.

Подобные намерения дают возможность пред­ положить, что интересы в сфере
безопасности (например, Афганистан) приведут обе стороны к такому уровню
сотрудничества, который исключал бы взаимное сдерживание и восприятие
друг друга в качестве противников.

Россия - ЕС. После событий в Крыму и начала боевых действий на
юго-востоке Украины Евро­ союз (по инициативе Германии и Великобритании)
прекратил проведение совместных мероприятий и ввел санкции против РФ.
Была приостановлена работа всех совместных органов и мероприятий,
которые до этого составили каркас провозглашен­ ного во второй половине
2000-х годов стратегиче­ ского партнерства.

В своей Глобальной стратегии по внешней по­ литике и политике
безопасности ЕС провозгласил следующее: «Нарушение Россией
международного права и дестабилизация ситуации в Украине наряду с
затяжными конфликтами в регионе Черного моря стали вызовом для основ
европейской системы безопасности. Мы будем едины в защите междуна­
родного права, демократических прав человека, сотрудничества и права
каждого государства сво­ бодно определять свое будущее\...

Мы не признаем незаконную аннексию Крыма Россией и не смиримся с
дестабилизацией всей Украины»3.

Весной 2016 г. ЕС провозгласил пять принципов построения взаимоотношений
с Россией, главным из которых является принцип «избирательного
взаимо­действия», который предполагает, что ЕС будет сотрудничать с
Москвой только по вопросам, кото­ рые представляют интерес для самого
Евросоюза. Однако непонятно, как при этом будут учитываться вопросы,
представляющие интерес для РФ.

Брюссель неоднократно подчеркивал, что пово­ дом для, так сказать,
«разблокировки» отношений будет являться прогресс в реализации Минских
со­ глашений по урегулированию в Украине. И здесь очень много неясностей:
ЕС считает Россию участни­ цей конфликта, вместе с тем Москва никогда не
при­ знает себя таковой. Возникает вопрос - как могут соглашения,
основной целью которых было прекра­ щение огня и спасение украинской
армии (кстати говоря, эту задачу они выполнили и в 2014 г. после
Иловайска, и в 2015 г. после Дебальцево), являться основой для
разрешения конфликта в целом, ибо требования политического характера,
предъявляемые Киеву, будут означать поражение любого режима,
находящегося в Киеве. Второй вопрос - о релевантно­ сти «нормандского
формата», эффективность которо­ го вызывает большие сомнения в связи с
очередным обострением отношений между Россией и Западом.

При всем этом следует отметить, что рабочие контакты между Россией и ЕС
продолжаются, а това­ рооборот между ними в 2017 г. вырос на 27%, однако
они не могут способствовать замещению стратегии по созданию «общих
пространств», которая была провозглашена в первой половине 2000-х и
которая потерпела фиаско по той причине, что Россия и ЕС не имели общих
целей по их формированию, а рассмат­ ривали друг друга в качестве
конкурентов. Идея сотрудничества двух интеграционных образований - ЕС и
ЕАЭС - пока, видимо, неосуществима по при­ чине слабости ЕАЭС и
вследствие позиции союзни­ ков России - Белоруссии и Казахстана.

Представляется рациональным вернуться к идее формирования Совета ЕС -
Россия по вопросам безопасности, которая обсуждалась после Кавказ­ ского
кризиса осенью 2008 г. Это обусловлено тем, что, как считает известный
российский европеист Ю. Борко, главной сферой общих интересов на
ближайшие годы будет именно сфера безопасности1. И хотя в настоящий
момент обе стороны заняты наращиванием собственных военных потенциалов
(ЕС совместно с НАТО), основными и реальными угрозами их безопасности
будут воинствующий исламский терроризм, последствия изменения кли­ мата,
непредсказуемость, исходящая из центра за­ падного мира - из Вашингтона
(фактор Трампа), распространение ОМУ и средств его доставки, ми­
литаризация космоса, киберугрозы и ряд других. По всем этим вопросам ЕС
и Россия не имеют аль­ тернативы взаимному сотрудничеству.

Пока же с обеих сторон отсутствует политиче­ ская воля к осознанию причин
нынешнего кризиса, их оценки и переосмысления. Не просматривается
потенциал формирования архитектуры общеевро­ пейской безопасности на
основе баланса интересов Россия - ЕС.

В этой связи представляется важным обратить внимание на ряд инициатив
европейских стран (прежде всего Франции) по созданию так называе­ мой
«европейской армии», РЕ8СО, Европейского фонда обороны и т.д. С этими
инициативами связа­ ны иллюзии части российских политиков и экспер­ тов по
поводу того, что следствием явится ослабле­ ние и даже раскол НАТО.

Попытаемся разобраться в том, что же происхо­ дит на самом деле? Не
следует забывать, что 22 госу­ дарства ЕС являются одновременно членами
НАТО. На Варшавском (2016) и Брюссельском саммитах (2018). НАТО были
приняты совместные декларации двух евро-атлантических институтов, где
подтвер­ ждается принцип стратегического партнерства. А до этого в
глобальной стратегии ЕС для внешней поли­ тики и обороны признавалось,
что «НАТО остается самой важной инстанцией для большинства госу­
дарств-членов в сфере безопасности»2. Соответствен­ но ЕС будет углублять
отношения с Североатланти­ ческим альянсом, стремясь к
«взаимодополняемости и синергии», но «сохраняя автономию - в приня­ тии
решений»3. В совместных декларациях ЕС - НАТО были определены семь
направлений стратеги­ ческого партнерства: 1) противодействие гибридным
угрозам; 2) оперативное сотрудничество (в том числе на море и по
вопросам миграции); 3) кибербезопас­ ность и оборона; 4) оборонные
потенциалы; 5) обо­ ронная промышленность и оборонные исследования; 6)
совместные учения; 7) поддержка формирования потенциала на юге и
востоке. Определены 74 сферы сотрудничества в районах реализации
совместных деклараций, 20 из которых сосредоточены на проти­ водействии
гибридным угрозам, включая создание Европейского центра передового опыта
по противо­ действию гибридным угрозам.

Принципами сотрудничества ЕС - НАТО явля­ ются открытость, прозрачность,
инклюзивность, зер­ кальность, полное уважение независимости принятия
решений. Определены механизмы реализации декла­ раций: совместные
тренинги, учебные курсы, обмен предупреждениями об угрозах,
кросс-брифинги, сов­ местные инициативы по антикризисному управлению в
сфере кибербезопасности.

Такие инициативы Евросоюза как РЕ8СО, Ев­ ропейский оборонный фонд
(Е\^Р), План развития потенциала ЕС, Ежегодный скоординированный обзор
по вопросам обороны (САКВ) и соответст­ вующие программы в НАТО, а
именно: процесс оборонного планирования, программа планирова­ ния и
анализа, партнерство во имя мира координи­ руются между собой. Штабы НАТО
и ЕС сообща работают над повышением военной мобильности. Развивается
диалог по вопросам военной промыш­ ленности. Особое внимание уделяется
вопросу доступа предприятий малого и среднего бизнеса к цепочке поставок
и инноваций в сфере обороны.

В октябре 2017 г. были проведены первые па­ раллельные и
скоординированные учения НАТО и ЕС, в ходе которых была проведена
проверка меха­ низмов практического сотрудничества при реаги­ ровании на
кризис, в том числе в условиях гибрид­ ной войны. В ноябре 2018 г. прошли
вторые совме­ стные учения.

Укрепляется политический диалог между ЕС и НАТО. В практику вошли
взаимные приглашения на соответствующие министерские заседания, кросс­
брифинги.

Учитывая все вышеперечисленные моменты, в штаб-квартире НАТО не
проявляют никакой обеспо­ коенности по поводу европейских инициатив, по­
нимая, что все они носят комплементарный (т.е. взаимодополняющий)
характер и не подрывают веду­ щую роль НАТО в сфере обороны и
безопасности (так, например, РЕ8СО увеличит мобильность НАТО и т.д.). А
представители Еврокомиссии и Евросо­ вета подчеркивают, что они дополняют
инициативы НАТО и не представляют угрозу ни для РФ, ни для ВПК США.

Выборы в Европарламент в мае 2019 г. явились этапом на пути развития
Евросоюза в целом. С одной стороны, они продемонстрировали опре­ деленное
«дряхление» традиционных партий в ряде стран ЕС и повышение роли правых
популистов, которые получили в общей сложности на 35 мест больше, чем на
предыдущих выборах (связано это помимо всего прочего с европейским
миграцион­ ным кризисом, который пережила Европа в период между
выборами). С другой стороны, тот факт, что Европейская народная партия и
Прогрессивный Альянс социалистов и демократов, потеряв опреде­ ленное
количество мест (что не позволяет им со­ хранить большинство в ЕП),
все-таки лидируют, подтвердил настроения европейских избирателей в
поддержку европейского интеграционного проекта.

Смогут ли относительно усилившиеся популист­ ские партии повлиять на
политику Евросоюза в от­ ношении России, покажет время. Однако тем экспер­
там и политикам в России, которые связывают с этим усилением надежды на
снятие антироссийских санк­ ций и начало нового этапа в
российско-евросоюзов­ ских отношениях, следует напомнить, что такие же
надежды они связывали с приходом в Белый дом в Вашингтоне Д. Трампа.
Действительность оказалась куда более жестокой и беспощадной.

Россия - ОБСЕ. Единственной организацией в сфере евро-атлантической
безопасности, членом которой является Россия, остается ОБСЕ. До на­ чала
2000-х годов Россия утверждала, что именно эта организация является
краеугольным камнем европейской безопасности, и именно с ее помощью
пыталась противодействовать расширению НАТО. Однако когда этого не
получилось, поскольку все страны бывшего советского блока и даже респуб­
лики бывшего СССР - все члены ОБСЕ - выразили четкое желание
интегрироваться в Североатланти­ ческий альянс, а также, учитывая тот
факт, что деятельность ОБСЕ к этому моменту сосредото­ чилась на
мониторинговых миссиях по отслежива­ нию демократических процессов на
постсоветском пространстве, Россия перешла на позиции резкой критики
ОБСЕ. В период так называемой «золотой эры» во взаимоотношениях России и
НАТО (2002­ 2007 годы) у российских элит видимо складыва­ лось
впечатление, что многие проблемы безопасно­ сти могут быть решены на
площадке Совета Россия - НАТО.

Однако в 2008 г. после Бухарестского саммита НАТО, в ходе которого США
попытались (правда, безуспешно, поскольку этому воспрепятствовали
европейские союзники) предоставить Украине и Грузии План действий по
членству в НАТО, Рос­ сия через предложение по Договору о европейской
безопасности (ДЕБ) вновь попыталась вернуть ОБСЕ былое значение. После
пятидневной войны на Кавказе (август 2008 г.) различные варианты ДЕБ
обсуждались с Францией и Германией, а затем сти­ мулировали начало
дискуссии в рамках ОБСЕ о будущем европейской безопасности, которая выли­
лась в так называемый «процесс Корфу». Были созданы 10
специализированных групп: по вопросам выполнения всеми государствами
норм и принципов ОБСЕ; по роли организации в решении задач ран­ него
предупреждения, предотвращения и урегули­ рования кризисов и конфликтов;
постконфликтной реабилитации; контролю над вооружением и мерам
укрепления доверия; невоенным угрозам безопасно­ сти; вызовам в области
экономики и экологии; правам человека, демократии и верховенству закона;
повышению эффективности ОБСЕ и др1.

Россия и страны Запада не пришли к общему знаменателю в ходе обсуждаемых
вопросов, поэто­ му на саммите в Астане в 2010 г. не удалось согла­ совать
новую повестку дня.

На фоне серьезной деградации отношений Рос­ сии с рядом
евро-атлантических институтов в усло­ виях украинского и сирийского
кризисов ОБСЕ остается единственной площадкой, где еще возмож­ ны
какие-то договоренности. Во-первых, речь может идти о возобновлении
процесса контроля над воо­ ружениями и формировании на новом этапе мер
доверия, без чего невозможно представить выход из существующего кризиса.
Во-вторых, об организации миротворческой миссии на юго-востоке Украины,
но, по-видимому, не только для охраны сотрудников ОБСЕ, а в более
широком масштабе. Наконец, о создании площадки в рамках ОБСЕ, на которой
изучались бы и обсуждались причины нынешнего кризиса с извлечением
уроков из него, без чего невозможно продвижение вперед.

При этом следует иметь в виду, как отмечает российский исследователь А.
Загорский, что ны­ нешний стратегический курс России сложился не под
влиянием отдельных событий, но вследствие определенного числа явлений,
проблем и кризисов, выстроенных в цепочку (вольно или невольно)
встраивания России в существовавшую тогда сис­ тему безопасности на
условиях Запада, что само по себе, учитывая фактор стратегической
независимо­ сти РФ, не могло не вызвать противодействия1.

В нынешних условиях, когда скорее всего (со­ гласно концепции бывшего
советника Б. Обамы, президента Совета по международным отношениям США
Ричарда Хааса)2 мир движется к бесполяр- ному миропорядку, а
международные отношения подвергаются серьезной трансформации, значение
традиционных государств и межгосударственных объединений будет
снижаться, утверждения о том, что удел России - это «стратегическое
одиноче­ ство», что ей не нужны союзники и она самодоста­ точна и что ее
судьба - это конфронтация с коллек­ тивным Западом (включая Европу)
крайне опасны. Они неизбежно приведут страну к самомаргинали- зации,
исключению ее из мировой экономической и политической системы.

«Россия есть держава европейская» - утверждала Екатерина II еще в конце
XVIII столетия. И она, безусловно, была таковой до октября 1917 г.
Затем, когда вследствие большевистского переворота Россия стала
«выламываться» из своей «европейскости», она потерпела чудовищное
поражение в мирном противо­ стоянии с Европой и США. Представляется, что
Россия не имеет права на повторение подобной исто­ рической ошибки, а
должна вместе с европейскими партнерами искать пути выхода из
сложившегося тяжелейшего кризиса.

В качестве первых шагов можно было бы пред­ ложить следующие.

\- Остановить начавшуюся гонку вооружений (в том числе в сфере
кибербезопасности), наращи­ вание военных потенциалов, проведение широко­
масштабных военных учений; разрабатывать новые меры доверия.

\- Разрабатывать совместные подходы по разбло­ кировке конфликта на
юго-востоке Украины, по­ скольку без решения этой острейшей проблемы
невозможно решать никакие вопросы безопасности в Европе.

\- Начать подготовку совместных проектов с Евросоюзом по восстановлению
регионов, постра­ давших от конфликтов.

\[TRANSLATION\]

The trigger was the [events in and around Ukraine]{.underline} in
2013-2014, when Ukraine and the EU discussed the signing of the
association Agreement with the European Union, which resulted first in a
peaceful and then armed Maidan, the Russian operation to annex Crimea,
and the development of events in the south-east of Ukraine. [Russia and
the West have different views]{.underline} on the causes of the current
crisis: [Russia]{.underline} [believes that the West]{.underline}
[crossed the Rubicon]{.underline} when it supported the armed overthrow
of the legitimate Yanukovich regime after the representatives of the
three EU countries gave it security guarantees; [the]{.underline}
[West]{.underline} [believes]{.underline} that [Russia]{.underline}
[crossed the Rubicon when it violated the Budapest
Memorandum]{.underline} of 1994, being one of the leaders of the three
guarantors of the territorial integrity of Ukraine in exchange for the
latter\'s renunciation of nuclear weapons, [and then intervened in the
development of events in the south-east]{.underline} of this country.

[Different interpretations of the causes of the crisis lead to the fact
that neither side is]{.underline} [ready to \"stick to the
principles\"]{.underline} [and start a serious conversation about the
basics of a]{.underline} [new detente]{.underline}. [We are
witnessing]{.underline} a [further escalation. In the context
of]{.underline} the most [acute information war]{.underline}, [both
sides use any means possible]{.underline} [to undermine]{.underline}
each other\'s reputation and, as it were, exclude the possibility of
[future agreements]{.underline}.

At the same time, [cooperation with institutions]{.underline} - [NATO,
the EU, the OSCE]{.underline}, and the Council of Europe - [has
been]{.underline} somewhat [restrained]{.underline} over a number of
crisis years.

Russia - NATO. April 1, 2014 in response to the action In response to
Russia\'s intervention in Crimea, [NATO suspended]{.underline}
[all]{.underline} types of practical [cooperation through the
Russia-NATO Council]{.underline}, arguing that \" business as before is
impossible.\" However, the work of the Council itself was not frozen; it
met several times at the ambassadorial level between 2014 and 2018. It
should be noted, however, that the ambassadors exchanged mutual
accusations, and the results of the meetings were almost zero. Decisions
of the Alliance\'s Wales Summit (September 2014) showed that NATO has
returned from repelling new threats to its roots in collective defense.
The declaration following the summit noted that the NATO Readiness
Action Plan (NATO Ceabte88 AeTup R1ap) responded \"to changes in the
security environment at the borders of the Alliance\" and to
\"challenges generated by Russia and their strategic consequences\"2.
The plan assumed a permanent presence of the triad of armed forces and
substantial NATO military activity in the eastern zone on a potential
basis.

The Warsaw Summit of the Alliance in 2016 demonstrated the readiness of
the transatlantic allies to undertake symbolic strengthening (in the
form of four battalions of 1 thousand people each) of defense structures
in the eastern direction, but they were not ready to sacrifice the
Fundamental Act of Russia-NATO of 1997, which was insisted on by a
number of Central and Eastern European countries (it was where it was
mentioned that NATO refused to permanently deploy significant combat
forces in new areas of deployment) 1.

In early 2018, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg even issued a
statement, according to which he called on the allies to take into
account the fact that they are dealing with a \"more confident Russia\".
\"We would not want a repeat of the Cold War and the arms race, we are
in favor of a political dialogue with Moscow\"2. At the beginning of
2018, the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Ministry of Defense,
G. V. Gerasimov visited NATO headquarters and held talks with NATO
military officials, during which issues such as the situation in
Ukraine, Afghanistan, transparency of military activities and reducing
the risk of military confrontations were discussed (it should be noted
here that in 2016 alone, more than 60 military incidents occurred in the
Baltic Sea region). in the airspace between the aircraft of the Russian
Federation and NATO countries).

Russia and NATO exercise so-called strategic restraint: Russia - when it
does not deploy additional military contingents in the Pskov and
Kaliningrad regions (except for air defense systems), and NATO - when it
does not want to withdraw from the Russian - NATO Alliance and deploy
significant armed forces on the eastern flank.

Of course, in the short and medium term, [Russia and NATO are unlikely
to]{.underline} [return to]{.underline} the level of
[cooperation]{.underline} that existed in the 2000s, when 25 working
groups were established under the NRC, including joint peace-building
and the creation of a missile defense theater.

Especially in the context when [the Russian Foreign
Ministry]{.underline} in mid-April 2019 [announced a decision to
completely break off relations between Russia and NATO]{.underline} [on
military and civilian lines]{.underline}. This decision was probably
based on an awareness of the impasse in maintaining the appearance of
relations, an understanding that in fact, despite certain rhetoric from
representatives of the Alliance, NATO does not lead to real intentions
and preparations for a military conflict, hopes that it is more
realistic to negotiate with the United States, rather than with a
significant number of them. European allies, some of which are
categorically anti-Russian.

It seems that [both the NATO decision]{.underline} of April 1, 2014
[and]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Russian]{.underline}
[decision]{.underline} of April 2019 [are]{.underline} [not
optimal]{.underline}. First, because [it is precisely in times of
crisis]{.underline} [that we need to stay at the negotiating
table]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [not slam the door]{.underline}.
Secondly, because [the lack of channels of operational
interaction]{.underline} between the military [can lead to incidents
both in the]{.underline} [air and sea space]{.underline} [in the Baltic
region]{.underline}, [where aircraft and ships of NATO]{.underline}
countries [and the Russian Federation are quite common]{.underline}. In
this context, Nadia would like to despite the fact that at least
informal contacts between the military remain.

[Neither Russia nor NATO has any intention of escalating]{.underline}
the crisis and transforming it into a real military confrontation,
[despite]{.underline} the rather [harsh propaganda rhetoric]{.underline}
on both sides in the ongoing information war.

The geopolitical uncertainty that characterizes the current stage of
global development and relations along the Russia - West line is not the
best background for the possibility of any positive development on the
Russia - NATO track. At the same time, it should not be forgotten that
the Alliance does not translate the issue of integration of Georgia and
Ukraine into a practical plane, which would mean readiness for a
military confrontation with Russia. Russia, realizing that the
Alliance\'s military budget exceeds Russia\'s military expenditures by
more than 20 times, also has no intentions to develop the conflict
potential of relations.

Such intentions make it possible to predict that security interests (for
example, Afghanistan) will lead both sides to a level of cooperation
that would exclude mutual deterrence and the perception of each other as
opponents.

Russia - EU. After the events in Crimea and the outbreak of hostilities
in the south-east of Ukraine, the European Union (at the initiative of
Germany and Great Britain) stopped holding joint events and imposed
sanctions against the Russian Federation. The work of all joint bodies
and activities that had previously formed the framework of the strategic
partnership announced in the second half of the 2000s was suspended.

In its Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy, the EU has
declared the following:: \"Russia\'s violation of international law and
the destabilization of the situation in Ukraine, along with the
protracted conflicts in the Black Sea region, have become a challenge to
the foundations of the European security system. We will stand united in
defending international law, democratic human rights, cooperation and
the right of each State to freely determine its own future\...

We do not recognize Russia\'s illegal annexation of Crimea and will not
accept the destabilization of all of Ukraine. \" 3

Spring 2016 The EU has proclaimed five principles for building relations
with Russia, the main one being the principle of \"selective
interaction\", which assumes that the EU will cooperate with Moscow only
on issues that are of interest to the European Union itself. However, it
is unclear how this will take into account issues of interest to the
Russian Federation.

Brussels has repeatedly stressed that progress in the implementation of
the Minsk agreements on the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine will
be the key to \"unblocking\" relations. And there are a lot of
ambiguities here: The EU considers Russia a party to the conflict, but
Moscow never recognizes itself as such. The question arises-how can
agreements whose main goal was to end the fire and save the Ukrainian
army (by the way, they fulfilled this task both in 2014 after Ilovaisk
and in 2015) work? after Debaltseve), be the basis for resolving the
conflict as a whole, because the political demands imposed on Kiev will
mean the defeat of any regime in Kiev. The second question is about
relevant The effectiveness of the Normandy format is highly questionable
due to the latest aggravation of relations between Russia and the West.

At the same time, it should be noted that working contacts between
Russia and the EU continue, and trade turnover between them increased by
27% in 2017, but they cannot help replace the strategy for creating
\"common spaces\", which was proclaimed in the first half of the 2000s
and which failed due to the fact that Russia and the EU did not have
common goals for their formation, but considered each other as
competitors. The idea of cooperation between two integration
entities-the EU and the EAEU-is probably not feasible yet due to the
weakness of the EAEU and the position of Russia\'s allies - Belarus and
Kazakhstan.

It seems reasonable to return to the idea of forming an EU-Russia
Security Council, which was discussed after the Caucasus crisis in
autumn 2008. This is due to the fact that, according to the well-known
Russian Europeanist Yu.Borko, the main area of common interests in the
coming years will be the security sphere. 1 And while both sides are
currently engaged in building up their own military capabilities (the EU
together with NATO), the main and real threats to their security will be
militant Islamic terrorism, the consequences of climate change,
unpredictability coming from the center of the western world - from
Washington (the Trump factor), the proliferation of WMD and their means
of delivery, and militarization space, cyber threats, and a number of
others. On all these issues, the EU and Russia have no alternatives to
mutual cooperation.

In the meantime, there is a lack of political will on both sides to
understand the causes of the current crisis, assess them, and rethink
them. The potential for forming an architecture of pan - European
security based on a balance of interests between Russia and the EU is
not visible.

In this regard, it is important to pay attention to a number of
initiatives of European countries (primarily France) to create the
so-called \"European army\", RE8SO, the European Defense Fund, etc.
These initiatives are linked to Some Russian politicians and experts are
under the illusion that the result will be a weakening and even a split
of NATO.

Let\'s try to understand what is really happening. It should not be
forgotten that 22 EU States are simultaneously members of NATO. At the
Warsaw (2016) and Brussels (2018) summits. NATO adopted joint
declarations of the two Euro-Atlantic institutions, which affirm the
principle of strategic partnership. Before that, the EU\'s Global
Strategy for Foreign Policy and Defence recognized that \"NATO remains
the most important security authority for most Member States\"2.
Accordingly, the EU will deepen its relations with the North Atlantic
Alliance, striving for \"complementarity and synergy\" but \"maintaining
autonomy in decision-making\"3. The EU - NATO joint declarations
identified seven areas of strategic partnership: 1) countering hybrid
threats; 2) operational cooperation (including at sea and on migration);
3) cybersecurity and defense; 4) defense capabilities; 5) defense
industry and defense research; 6) joint exercises; and 7) support for
capacity-building in the south and east. 74 areas of cooperation have
been identified in the areas of implementation of the joint
declarations, 20 of which focus on countering hybrid threats, including
the establishment of the European Center of Excellence for Countering
Hybrid Threats.

The principles of EU - NATO cooperation are openness, transparency,
inclusiveness, transparency, and full respect for the independence of
decision-making. The mechanisms for implementing the declarations are
defined: joint trainings, training courses, exchange of warnings about
threats, cross-briefings, joint initiatives on crisis management in the
field of cybersecurity.

EU initiatives such as the PE8SO, the European Defence Fund (EEF), the
EU Capacity Development Plan, the Annual Coordinated Defence Review
(ACP) and related programmes in NATO, namely the defence planning
process, the Planning and Analysis Programme, and the Partnership for
Peace, are coordinated among themselves. NATO and EU headquarters are
working together to increase military mobility. A dialogue on military
industry issues is developing. Special attention is paid to the issue of
access of small and medium-sized businesses to the supply chain and
innovations in the field of defense.

In October 2017, the first parallel and coordinated NATO-EU exercises
were held, which tested practical cooperation mechanisms in crisis
response, including hybrid warfare. The second joint exercise was held
in November 2018.

The political dialogue between the EU and NATO is being strengthened.
Mutual invitations to relevant ministerial meetings and cross-briefings
have become part of the practice.

Taking into account all the above points, NATO headquarters does not
show any concern about European initiatives, understanding that they are
all complementary (i.e. complementary) and do not undermine the leading
role of NATO in the field of defense and security (for example, RE8CO
will increase NATO mobility, etc.). Representatives of the European
Commission and the European Council emphasize that they complement the
NATO initiatives and do not pose a threat to either the Russian
Federation or the US military-industrial complex.

The European Parliament elections in May 2019 marked a milestone in the
development of the European Union as a whole. On the one hand, they
demonstrated a certain \"decrepitude\" of traditional parties in a
number of EU countries and an increase in the role of right-wing
populists, who won a total of 35 more seats than in previous elections
(this is due, among other things, to the European migration crisis that
Europe experienced in the period between the elections). On the other
hand, the fact that the European People\'s Party and the Progressive
Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, having lost a certain number of
seats (which does not allow them to retain a majority in the EP), are
still leading, confirmed the mood of European voters in support of the
European integration project.

Time will tell whether the relatively strengthened populist parties will
be able to influence the EU\'s policy towards Russia. However, those
experts and politicians in Russia who attribute this increased hope to
the lifting of anti-Russian sanctions and the beginning of a new stage
in Russian-EU relations should be reminded that they had the same hopes
when Donald Trump came to the White House in Washington. The reality
turned out to be much more cruel and merciless.

Russia - OSCE. [The]{.underline} [OSCE]{.underline} [remains the only
Euro-Atlantic security organization]{.underline} [of which Russia is a
member]{.underline}. [Until the early 2000s, Russia claimed that this
organization was the cornerstone of European security, and]{.underline}
it was [with its help]{.underline} that it [tried to]{.underline}
[counteract]{.underline} [the expansion of NATO]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, when [this]{.underline} [failed]{.underline},
because all the countries of the former Soviet bloc and even the
republics of the former USSR - all OSCE members-expressed a clear desire
to integrate into the North Atlantic Alliance, and also, given the fact
that the OSCE\'s activities led to this Russia has focused on monitoring
missions to monitor democratic processes in the post-Soviet space, while
Russia has taken a position of harsh criticism of the OSCE. During the
so-called \"golden era\" in relations between Russia and NATO
(2002-2007), Russian elites apparently had the impression that many
problems were solved These issues can be resolved on the platform of the
NATO - Russia Council.

However, in 2008, after the Bucharest NATO Summit, during which the
United States tried (but unsuccessfully, as it was prevented by European
allies) to provide Ukraine and Georgia with an Action Plan for NATO
Membership, [Russia]{.underline}, through a proposal for the European
Security Treaty (ESC), again [tried to restore the OSCE]{.underline} [to
its former importance]{.underline}. After the five-day war in the
Caucasus (August 2008), various options for DEB were discussed with
France and Germany, and then a discussion was initiated within the OSCE
on the future of European security, which resulted in the so-called
\"Corfu process\". 10 specialized groups were created: on the
implementation of OSCE norms and principles by all States; on the
organization\'s role in early warning, crisis prevention and conflict
management; on post-conflict rehabilitation; on arms control and
confidence-building measures; and on non-military threats. economic and
environmental challenges; human rights, democracy and the rule of law;
and enhancing the effectiveness of the OSCE and dr1.

Russia and the West did not come to a common denominator in the course
of the issues discussed, so the Astana summit in 2010 failed to agree on
a new agenda.

[Against the background of the serious deterioration of Russia\'s
relations]{.underline} with a number of Euro-Atlantic institutions in
the context of the Ukrainian and Syrian crises, [the OSCE]{.underline}
[remains the only platform where any agreements are still
possible]{.underline}. First, [we can talk about the resumption of the
process of arms control]{.underline} [and the formation of
confidence-building measures]{.underline} [at a new stage]{.underline},
[without which it is impossible to imagine a way out of]{.underline} the
existing [crisis]{.underline}. Secondly, about the organization of a
peacekeeping mission in the south-east of Ukraine, but, apparently, not
only for the protection of OSCE employees, but on a larger scale.
Finally, the creation of a platform within the OSCE to study and discuss
the causes of the current crisis, drawing lessons from it, without which
it is impossible to move forward.

At the same time, it should be borne in mind, as the Russian researcher
A. Zagorsky notes, that the current strategic course of Russia was
formed not under the influence of individual events, but as a result of
a certain number of phenomena, problems and crises built up in a chain
(willingly or unwittingly) of integrating Russia into the then existing
security system on the conditions of the West, which This, given the
factor of strategic independence of the Russian Federation, could not
but cause opposition.1

In the current conditions, when most likely (according to the concept of
former adviser to Barack Obama, President of the Council on Foreign
Relations of the United States Richard Haas)2 the world is moving
towards a nonpolar world order, and international relations are
undergoing a major transformation, the importance of traditional states
and interstate associations will decrease, the claims that Russia\'s
destiny is \"strategic solitude\", that it does not need allies and is
self-sufficient, and that its fate is a confrontation with the
collective West (including Europe) are extremely dangerous. They will
inevitably lead the country to self-marginalization, its exclusion from
the global economic and political system.

\"Russia is a European power,\" Catherine II said at the end of the
eighteenth century. And it certainly was so until October 1917. Then,
when, as a result of the Bolshevik coup, Russia began to \"break out\"
of its \"Europeanness\", it suffered a monstrous defeat in a peaceful
counter-revolution. the United States and Europe. It seems that
[Russia]{.underline} has no right to repeat such a historical mistake,
but [must work]{.underline} [together]{.underline} [with]{.underline}
its [European partners]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [find ways out of
the current severe crisis]{.underline}.

The following could be suggested as [the]{.underline} [first
steps]{.underline}.

\- [Stop]{.underline} the beginning of [the]{.underline} [arms
race]{.underline} ([including]{.underline} [in the field of
cybersecurity]{.underline}), build up military capabilities, conduct
large-scale military exercises; [develop new confidence-building
measures]{.underline}.

\- To [develop joint approaches]{.underline} [to resolving]{.underline}
the conflict in the south-east of Ukraine, since without solving this
acute problem, it is impossible to solve any [security issues in
Europe]{.underline}.

\- Start preparing joint projects with the European Union to restore
regions affected by conflicts.

Introduction

[Recent technological and political developments in OSCE]{.underline}
participating [States suggest a strong interest in pursuing, testing and
using weaponised AI and weapons systems]{.underline} [with]{.underline}
increasingly [autonomous features]{.underline} controlled by algorithms.
In May 2021 Defence Minister Sergei [Shoigu announced]{.underline} that
[Russia had begun producing combat robots "capable of fighting on their
own"]{.underline},1 [while the French Army is planning to introduce
robotic systems by 2040]{.underline}.2 [The]{.underline} United Kingdom
([UK]{.underline}) government [has stated its objective of achieving "a
leading role in critical and emerging technologies]{.underline}"3 and
has established a Defence Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy Unit to
better understand them.4 In [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, the [N]{.underline}ational [S]{.underline}ecurity
[C]{.underline}ommission [on]{.underline} [A]{.underline}rtificial
[I]{.underline}ntelligence [has urged the government "not \[to\] be a
witness to the AI revolution in military affairs]{.underline}".5

[The]{.underline} [global discussion]{.underline} [about autonomous
weapons systems is often framed in a]{.underline}
[futuristic]{.underline} [way]{.underline} and focuses on lethal
autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) -- colloquially called "killer robots"
-- or the "AI arms race". [But weaponised AI is]{.underline} [already a
reality]{.underline} of European security. [Thus far participating
States have been]{.underline} [reluctant]{.underline} [to utilise the
OSCE]{.underline} platform [to address the risks]{.underline} caused by
the increasing autonomy of weapons systems. Building on this issue,
[this essay intends to address the]{.underline} following
[question]{.underline}s: (1) how does the lack of regulation of
weaponised AI affect security and stability in Europe? and (2)
[what]{.underline} [role]{.underline} [can the OSCE play in mitigating
the risks related to weaponised AI?]{.underline}

Weaponised AI practices: implications for European security

[A]{.underline} United Nations ([UN]{.underline}) [S]{.underline}ecurity
[C]{.underline}ouncil [report]{.underline} published in March 2021
[stated]{.underline} that "[l]{.underline}ethal [a]{.underline}utonomous
[w]{.underline}eapons [s]{.underline}ystems [were programmed to attack
targets without requiring]{.underline} [data connectivity]{.underline}
between the operator and the munition" during the Libyan civil war,
referring to the Turkish-made Kargu 2 armed loitering drone.6 [This
sparked a wave of]{.underline} worldwide [media reaction,
with]{.underline} many [headlines claiming]{.underline} that [the "age
of autonomous killer robots" has arrived]{.underline}.7 While it is
difficult to assess whether a weapon system has been operated in an
autonomous mode, whether in Libya or elsewhere, this episode indicates
that there is increased public awareness that AI-based weapons are
currently being developed, tested and used.8 In fact, more attention
should be paid to the fact that AI-based autonomy at various levels is
already present, among others in armed aerial loitering drones, ground
vehicles and air defence systems. The concept of autonomy has many
definitions and interpretations but is generally understood to be the
ability of a machine to perform an intended task without human
intervention by using the interaction of its sensors and computer
programming with the environment.9

[Weaponised AI is]{.underline} [affecting European security and
stability]{.underline} in two main ways. Firstly, [due to the absence
of]{.underline} [international regulations]{.underline} on the use of
weaponised AI, [the growing trend of]{.underline}
[automation]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [autonomy]{.underline} in
weapons systems [is]{.underline} silently [changing]{.underline} [the
way]{.underline} in which [humans are]{.underline} [involved in the use
of force]{.underline}.10 [Current applications of weaponised AI are
shifting the understanding of human control involved in critical
functions of weapons systems, especially those of identifying and
attacking targets]{.underline}.11 [For example, many OSCE participating
States use]{.underline} [air defence]{.underline} systems [with
automatic or semi-automatic features. The automation of critical
functions]{.underline} of air defence systems ["has diminished the
capacity of human operators to exercise meaningful human control over
specific targeting]{.underline} decisions".12 [The use of autonomy is
gradually changing warfare norms, similarly to the way in which the
proliferation of armed drones has encouraged targeted killing
operations]{.underline}.13 [Such developments pose]{.underline} legal,
ethical and [security risks]{.underline}.

The diminishing role of human control over weapons systems also
infringes upon several principles of international humanitarian law
(IHL) applicable to armed conflict.14 The principles of moral
responsibility and accountability are challenged by the process of
delegating crucial decisions such as selecting and attacking a target to
an autonomous function that has no moral agency.15 Current AI-based
weapons systems are said to be unable to satisfy the requirements of
distinction between legitimate and illegitimate targets during combat.
These types of weapons systems lack the situation awareness necessary to
discriminate between combatants and civilians.16

Moreover, a diminishing human involvement in the operation of weapons
systems with autonomous features has substantial security risks, since
[the risk of potentially catastrophic failure]{.underline} ["can never
be]{.underline} [entirely eliminated".]{.underline}17 [Humans
do]{.underline} [not]{.underline} fully [understand]{.underline}
[AI-based weapons]{.underline} systems, [and the declining role of
humans in their operation exacerbates]{.underline} [this]{.underline}
knowledge gap. As a UN Institute for Disarmament Research report has
noted, "All complex weapon systems can have failure modes that cannot be
foreseen. But it is likely to be harder to anticipate, quantify and
characterize the risks associated with those issues in autonomous
weapons".18 The factors causing these risks include an acceleration of
the speed of warfare,19 a destabilising effect,20 the strengthening and
"normalisation" of practices such as targeted killings,21 an increase in
the asymmetries of warfare,22 and the proliferation of autonomous
weapons among terrorist organisations and non-state actors.23

[Both]{.underline} [Azerbaijan and Armenia]{.underline}
[used]{.underline} [u]{.underline}ninhabited [a]{.underline}erial
[v]{.underline}ehicle[s]{.underline} [during the]{.underline} 2020
[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and several IHL violations such as
indiscriminate attacks on civilians were recorded]{.underline}.24 While
these weapons systems are not officially classified as LAWS, many
[analysts]{.underline} have [deemed their use to be an efficient way of
conducting warfare]{.underline} that could contribute to other states'
pursuit of similar technologies. Since there is no way of verifying the
level of human control over these systems, operational practices are
silently continuing to change the norms of war and legitimise the use of
weaponised AI. In other words, "the operational trend towards developing
AI-enabled weapon systems continues and is on track to becoming
established as 'the new normal' in warfare".25 While there are no legal
norms defining a responsible use of weaponised AI, the way in which
states use this technology will continue to shape the way warfare is
conducted and may increase risks to European and global security.

Secondly, the discourse surrounding weaponised AI -- i.e. [how OSCE
participating States talk about LAWS]{.underline} -- also
[has]{.underline} a [considerable impact]{.underline} [on European
security. Both a common definition]{.underline} of LAWS [and agreement
on the appropriate level of human control]{.underline} [over weapons
systems are lacking, resulting in]{.underline} the
[misinterpretation]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the [risks]{.underline}
that arise. [Looking at the discourse of]{.underline} three [major
players]{.underline} in European security − [France, Russia, and the
United Kingdom]{.underline} − [one sees that their official positions
converge]{.underline} [on the importance of retaining human
control]{.underline} over these weapons. The French Armed Forces
minister has said that "France refuses to entrust the decision of life
or death to a machine that would act in a completely autonomous manner
and would be beyond any human control".26 [Russia has said that it "is
committed to the need to maintain human control over LAWS, no matter how
'advanced' these systems may be".]{.underline}27 The UK Ministry of
Defence has noted, "the operation of our weapon systems will always be
under human control and no UK weapons systems will be capable of
attacking targets without this".28

Nevertheless, autonomy and the concept of appropriate human control over
weapons systems are perceived differently. Russia remains opposed to a
legally binding treaty that would ban LAWS, arguing that the definition
of LAWS should "strike a balance between humanitarian concerns and
\[the\] legitimate defence interests of states".29 France has suggested
a division between "fully" and "partially" LAWS and is only prohibiting
"fully" autonomous weapons.30 Meanwhile, the UK has stated that "an
autonomous system is capable of understanding higher-level intent and
direction", a definition that is more precise and constraining on the
user31 and is "clearly out of step with the definitions used by most
other governments".32

As a common denominator, [these states agree on the principle that
weapons systems should not function completely
autonomously]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, the
[differences]{.underline} [in their views create
misperceptions]{.underline} [about]{.underline} the [uses]{.underline}
of AI, specifically [among the leading states in this sphere, which are
all carefully watching one another's]{.underline} technological
[developments. There are risks of misunderstanding]{.underline}, for
instance [when one state is developing a weapon system that another
state considers to be a lethal autonomous system. Such communication
issues can lead to a security dilemma]{.underline} in which "one state's
pursuit of greater automation and faster reaction times undermines other
states' security, leads them to similarly pursue more automation just to
keep up" [and encourages]{.underline} experts to speak of [an "AI arms
race"]{.underline}.33

As a possible response, [several states, scholars, and civil society
organisations have been arguing for a ban on LAWS]{.underline}. Since
2013 [this issue has been discussed in the framework of the]{.underline}
UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons ([CCW]{.underline}).
[A]{.underline} Group of Governmental Experts ([GGE]{.underline}) [on
emerging technologies related to LAWS was established]{.underline} in
2016 [to pursue the debate in a more]{.underline} [formal]{.underline}
[setting. However, the discussions are often framed in]{.underline}
[futuristic terms]{.underline}, [focusing on "killer
robots"]{.underline} and their potential to operate fully autonomously
and without human oversight, [while]{.underline} [existing]{.underline}
[weapons systems with increasingly autonomous features already have the
potential to affect security and stability]{.underline}.

At the same time, [the implications of weaponised AI for European and
international security are not set in stone]{.underline}. Ultimately, AI
is not an agent that decides its own path. The trajectory of weaponised
AI, as other technologies in the military sphere used for conventional
weapons, is not inevitable. [The AI arms race scenario may or may not
develop: much will depend on how states decide to use the AI
capabilities that they are pursuing]{.underline}.

Importantly, [we do not argue NATO is the only---or even the most
important---actor shaping AI governance in international
security]{.underline}. Other contributors in this Handbook impressively
detail efforts at both state and regional levels. Our aim has been to
convince sceptics that NATO has a role that is not replicated by other
stakeholders in the international security environment. NATO has
particular influence, procedures, and the competency to institute
certain governance mechanisms---namely standardization and policy
planning---that it can build on without needing to expend time building
new institutions from scratch. Beyond just a role, NATO is incentivized
to emerge as a steward of AI governance and use these mechanisms for
future operations, should the Alliance wish to maintain its unique
position as a leader encouraging policy alignment, defense planning, and
military standardization.

More broadly, [this chapter illustrates that regional and international
organizations]{.underline} [have]{.underline} [high stakes for military
AI governance]{.underline}. As development, procurement, and
implementation of AI is accelerating, [it is imperative that
international organizations]{.underline} [facilitate cooperation among
states and industry partners to guide responsible military AI
implementation aligned with core values and legal obligations. The
convening and coordinating power of international organizations, among
other governance tools, is a necessary step for state cooperation and
policy alignment.]{.underline} How exactly NATO interacts with [other
international organizations]{.underline} in the security architecture,
including the UN and EU, is a political topic that [will]{.underline}
also [have]{.underline} [important implications]{.underline} [for the
composition of international technology governance regimes]{.underline},
and is a subject for further research.

#### Concedes NATO alone [fails]{.underline}\-\--limited-membership organizations can't create norms with sufficiently wide buy-in.

Which stakeholders?

The distribution of risk across a technology's lifecycle is no small
challenge because it requires looping in the host of stakeholders
involved in -- and responsible for -- each aspect of the technology's
design, development, diffusion, and deployment. [Stakeholders like
international organisations, states, and the]{.underline}
[E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion are already mentioned above.
Yet, [to]{.underline} [meet]{.underline} [the wide-ranging
risks]{.underline}, [anticipatory governance]{.underline}
[requires]{.underline} [upstream involvement]{.underline} from other
relevant entities such as the private sector, civil society, academia,
and more nebulously defined research networks or communities of
practice. [Given the]{.underline} [rate]{.underline} [at which
technologies]{.underline} [converge]{.underline} to culminate in new
inventions, [no]{.underline} [single]{.underline} individual or
[entity]{.underline} [can]{.underline} [single-handedly]{.underline}
[manage risk and shape the trajectory of innovation to the benefit of
humanity.]{.underline}

[This means that to conduct]{.underline} [responsible
innovation]{.underline} -- also called responsible research and
innovation (RRI) in EU nomenclature), [anticipatory, deliberative, and
responsive governance can only be achieved by including]{.underline}
these [diverse perspectives]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [unique
responsibilities]{.underline}. This [inclusivity of]{.underline}
[many]{.underline} [stakeholders is]{.underline} also deemed
[necessary]{.underline} [to make sure that social and cultural aspects
are considered]{.underline} on top of technical ones. Responsible
innovation not only entails safety and security -- it goes further to
consider moral obligations that are embedded in hard and soft law, and
in human activity to help keep the focus on impact and outcomes,rather
than inputs.

In practice, [this requires a change in paradigm]{.underline} from one
of liability to a broader emphasis on accountability and responsibility.
In addition to the aforementioned ongoing attempts of the European
Commission to marry these concepts, interested parties may look toward
other organisations that have deep experience working with
safety-critical and high-risk systems. At the national level, democratic
governments, including their armed forces, are situated to take on these
responsibilities given that they are structured to adhere to strict
legal processes and reduce risks. For example, Australian defence
researchers and ethicists recently offered practical tools to manage
ethical risks, including a checklist, risk matrix, and a more formal
documentation program for high-risk AI systems. Such documentation
practices, which require different parties to register their involvement
in the system across its lifecycle, could apply equally to civilian or
defence processes.

Conclusion

A number of middle powers and small states have increased their interest
in shaping the international technology order, seeking to play an
outsized role in international technology governance. In the past,
coalitions of small states and civil society organisations have proven
decisive in disarmament and non-proliferation initiatives. Ireland, for
instance, was part of the "core group" of the Ottawa Process that led to
the 1997 Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. For such core groups to
establish the rules of the international technology order today,
facilitating governance changes to responsible innovation may be key,
while managing technological risks affecting human rights and power
dynamics in the international system are equally relevant.

It is not new to focus technology management on practices such as norms,
standards, and regulations. But the interrelationships between
governments and other crucial governance actors -- in the private,
public, academic, and civil society sectors -- will be important to
shape innovation in alignment with core values. [Weaving
together]{.underline} coherent [governance regimes]{.underline} [whereby
actors understand their responsibilities in mitigating risk
is]{.underline} [important]{.underline} to preventing negative
consequences across the technology lifecycle. What is more, [in this
modern-day competitive international system, the earlier]{.underline}
that [attempts to shape the international technology order take place,
the greater the opportunity]{.underline} [to create]{.underline}
democratic [accountability]{.underline}.

4\. The process of consolidating existing norms under the OSCE umbrella

4.1 The old and new role of the OSCE

The more we try to perceive conflict as a manifestation of failed
management of disagreements, the higher are the chances of developing
efficient conflict prevention measures.35 [Norm-making
processes]{.underline} [offer valuable opportunities for stakeholders
to]{.underline} [recognize the effects]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[limited trust]{.underline} [between major powers and the means
to]{.underline} [overcome them]{.underline}. Regional organizations such
as the OSCE were created as a response to the need observed by States to
build trust and strengthen cooperation and are often regarded as holding
the key to the impasse at the global level.36

Regional organizations have a long history of working with CBMs in
conventional security areas.37 The OSCE, the world's largest
security-oriented regional organization, has a direct mandate to work on
reducing risks of conflict in Europe, and successfully played the role
it assumed in 2011 to strengthen cybersecurity.38 In 2017, the
[OSCE]{.underline} had already developed sixteen practical and
actionable measures in this area, which can be grouped into two main
clusters: transparency and cooperation measures. These [tools aim at
enhancing]{.underline} [cooperation, transparency, predictability, and
stability, to reduce]{.underline} the [risks]{.underline} [of
misperception, escalation, and conflict, that may stem from]{.underline}
the use of ICTs.39 These goals are tackled through information-sharing,
improvement of national protective capacities, cooperation on incident
response, and refrainment from [destabilizing State
practices]{.underline}.40

[Due to its]{.underline} [long history]{.underline} [of promoting
constructive dialogue, the OSCE is]{.underline} [best suited to
continuously respond to regional concerns or needs, not only of
like-minded participating States, but also to bring together
non-likeminded States which are in different stages of cyber
development]{.underline}.41 [OSCE's active efforts in
shaping]{.underline} developments in [the cyber domain, including
setting the]{.underline} [global tone]{.underline} [for the development
and operationalization of norms and CBMs, is]{.underline} [broadly
recognized]{.underline} [by its]{.underline} [partner
organizations]{.underline} [and in]{.underline} [GGE
reports]{.underline}.42

As the current OSCE's focus is to implement already agreed CBMs, rather
than pursuing additional cyber norms, this paper aims at arguing several
tools of [effective]{.underline} [consolidation]{.underline}.43 First,
this process [should build on previously agreed principles and
norms]{.underline}, and focus on issues which received broad support by
individual States, or by parallel processes, such as the GGE. Although
due diligence is not widely endorsed as a binding rule of international
law, [there is]{.underline} currently [widespread support]{.underline}
[of this]{.underline} non-binding [norm]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[responsible State behavior]{.underline}.44 Voluntary non-binding norms
can progressively acquire customary international law status, as well as
third party endorsement. Efficient norms may generate productive
imitation, especially if these are agreed by soft powers, as the
espionage case illustrates.45 Therefore, [simplicity might
be]{.underline} the [key, by reaching]{.underline} [political
commitments]{.underline} [among a group of]{.underline} [like-minded
actors]{.underline}, by operationalization of agreements and development
of culturally grounded behavioral expectations.46 The potential for
practical implementation of CBMs makes them unique instruments, not just
in the OSCE area, but as a source of good practices for other
organizations to replicate.47

Second, the [OSCE efforts]{.underline} [escape]{.underline} many of [the
hurdles of]{.underline} [high-level]{.underline} political [commitments,
including]{.underline} [vague language, and focus on]{.underline}
[directive steps]{.underline}.48 The stakeholders should identify and
capitalize on the benefits of regional bodies, including their capacity
to be more responsive to the changing environment, and the closed
sessions with less public scrutiny, where States' concerns can be more
effectively addressed.49 Moreover, benefiting from an established
Secretariat and attached procedures, States can adapt OSCE
information-sharing platforms to even more robust frameworks. As a
neutral organization, with a clear mandate, the OSCE can act as an
objective forum, because it does not have defense or sanctioning
prerogatives.

Third, the OSCE should capitalize on the participation of its
stakeholders, which are States, primary actors of international law.
[While]{.underline} [other]{.underline} [norm-making
laboratories]{.underline}, such as the Tallinn Manual 2.0,
[are]{.underline} [influential]{.underline} resources,
[these]{.underline} multilateral [efforts are]{.underline}

[are]{.underline} [standing members of the OSCE]{.underline}.

Secondly, on broadening the scope and participants of the dialogue:
Current [US and European sanctions on Russia have]{.underline}
undoubtedly [had a punishing impact]{.underline} on the Russian economy,
[but at the same time, opportunities to engage]{.underline} the private
sector and technical [experts]{.underline} from both countries [in
solving shared problems]{.underline} [have been]{.underline} too
[often]{.underline} [overlooked]{.underline}. For example, Russian and
US [negotiators have]{.underline} so far [tip-toed around]{.underline}
[vital]{.underline} [but]{.underline} [difficult topics]{.underline}
[like setting rules]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [interstate cyber
conflict]{.underline}, [countering the rise of
radicalization]{.underline} [via cyberspace, and increasing transparency
and accountability around advanced]{.underline}
[biotechnology]{.underline}. Private sector actors on both sides would
have considerable interest in advancing these dialogues, which might
take place within what Trump and Putin called in Helsinki a "working
group" of Russian and American business leaders. The surrounding
domestic politics are atrocious and sanctions cast a pall over
discussions generally, but Washington has enough additional positive and
negative arrows in its quiver to seek much more from U.S.-Russia
dialogue.

[A]{.underline} final [missed opportunity]{.underline}, one [especially
important]{.underline} [for the West]{.underline} [to signal interest in
engagement]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the whole of
[Russia]{.underline} [beyond]{.underline} [Putin, is the]{.underline}
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe
([OSCE]{.underline}). [The OSCE embodies the values and legacy of
the]{.underline} 1975 [Helsinki Final Act]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
the 1990 [Charter of Paris]{.underline} -- [monumental deals that
facilitated the Cold War's peaceful end]{.underline}. [Yet the OSCE's
most visible roles today are its election observer missions]{.underline}
and special monitoring mission in Ukraine, and the Organisation's
centrepiece, [the Permanent Council]{.underline} in Vienna, at which all
57 participating states are represented, [has become little more than an
echo chamber for mutual recriminations]{.underline}. [Now is the time
for jump-starting meaningful dialogue between Russians and Americans,
with Europeans at the table]{.underline}--- on this, a hopeful sign
underway in the OSCE's Structured Dialogue initiative aimed at exploring
foundational questions about threat perceptions and conflict resolution.

As a recent speech by Vice President Mike Pence underscored,\[2\] the US
and China appear to be heading for breaking point after only a few years
of uncomfortable coexistence as the world's dominant economies, with
China closing in on US military power. The addition of a provoked
Beijing to the current dead-end US-Russian conflict is not likely to
benefit US, or European, interests.

[The window]{.underline} for getting US-Russia relations back on track
[is]{.underline} [closing]{.underline} before our eyes,
[and]{.underline} [missing it]{.underline} [may be the definitive end to
the relative peace and prosperity of the post-Cold War era.]{.underline}

1\. Introduction

Increased use of technology in civil, military, and commercial sectors,
and associated threats have forced scholars and States to consider the
international law implications of this new reality. [After States,
international organizations, and international coordinating fora
endorsed the application of]{.underline} [i]{.underline}nternational
[law]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [cyberspace, the debate shifted to
questions of how]{.underline} [existing principles, rights, and
obligations should be]{.underline} [interpreted]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the [cyber]{.underline} realm.2 [Various exercises have
attempted to identify the]{.underline} [applicable]{.underline}
international [rules, possible]{.underline} State [responses,
and]{.underline} [legal consequences]{.underline} of cyberoperations,
both during war and during peacetime.

States quickly realized that national [security]{.underline} heavily
[depends]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [international cooperation.
International efforts to counter cybersecurity risks]{.underline}
[debuted with]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline} [introduction of
a]{.underline} first United Nations ([U.N.]{.underline})
[resolution]{.underline} on this topic in 1998.3 [Numerous cyber policy
fora have]{.underline} [proliferated]{.underline} [since
then]{.underline} in diverse formats, such as the U.N. Group of
Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and
Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (GGE), the
subsequent U.N. Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of
ICTs in the Context of International Security (OEWG), and other
industry- focused norm processes.4 [These]{.underline} multistakeholder
[initiatives started]{.underline} [to shape cooperative]{.underline}
tools, [norms]{.underline} of behavior, and confidence-building measures
(CBMs) in support of collective cybersecurity. [One of the
exercises]{.underline} which is regarded among the [most
successful]{.underline} by the international community [is
the]{.underline} [high-level agreement]{.underline} on principles,
norms, and rules of the road for national internet activities and
transnational cyber interactions, conducted [under the auspices of
the]{.underline} Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe
([OSCE]{.underline}).

[In pursuit of its mandate to]{.underline} [promote]{.underline} human
rights and [conflict prevention, the OSCE can play a]{.underline} [major
role]{.underline} [to support]{.underline} operationalization of
international law and [application of]{.underline} existing [principles
to the]{.underline} [cyber realm]{.underline}. This paper examines some
key steps for the aftermath of the creation of norms of behavior, and
transparency and confidence-building measures (TCBMs). After a brief
analysis of norm-creation processes (part II), this paper will identify
some of the most pressing cybersecurity challenges on the international
landscape (part III), and offer some suggestions for consolidating the
voluntary non-binding norms States already agreed upon (part IV). Using
the lessons learned from other domains, the analysis will focus on
mechanisms of building further stability and transparency in cyberspace,
in particular by reference to the due diligence principle and States'
human rights obligations.

2\. From norm creation to consolidation

Analysis of traditional Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction can provide
useful lessons learned for cyberspace and demonstrates that if States
desire, global governance is possible, even in domains not covered by
territorial sovereignty, such as outer space, the High Seas, and
Antarctica.5 The traditional power race is reflected in cyberspace, and
this domain reveals additional challenges for reaching a multilateral
agreement, including lack of consensus on defining fundamental legal
terms and interpretations of internal and external State sovereignty.6

[While most States]{.underline} seem to [agree on the]{.underline}
[application]{.underline} [of general]{.underline}
[i]{.underline}nternational [law]{.underline} [to transboundary
cyberoperations, the precise translation of]{.underline} the
[rules]{.underline} [developed in the physical world to cyberspace is
widely debated. If States see a need to develop new rules, these should
build on]{.underline} and strengthen [the existing legal
framework]{.underline}. The creation of international cybernorms is at
the States' discretion, as it is these international law actors that
will be bound by any new rules. Efforts such as that which produced the
Tallinn Manuals can play extremely valuable roles, but are no substitute
for State practice or articulation of norms. On the one hand, these
exercises provide an opportunity for a thorough understanding of
normative expectations within relevant communities. On the other hand,
they have fragmented the legal approach to cyberspace, which further
hampers cybernorms ability to solidify and diffuse. Fragmentation is
most visible with respect to the scope of notions such as the threshold
of the use of force, due diligence, and essential State infrastructure,
all which will be detailed below.7

Additionally, most norm-making fora focus on the end product, i.e., the
creation of norms and their substantive content. The process itself is
often understated, although it represents the catalysator of building
trust and understanding, and the real power of a successful future of
norms lies in the processes by which they form and evolve. Therefore, it
was argued that the journey matters as much as the destination, namely
the manner in which cybernorms are constructed will shape the content
and character of the emerging norms.8

Norms are voluntary forms of cooperation, usually framed in a general
language, that provide ideal standards of conduct for State and
non-State actors. Usually lacking compliance, enforcement, and dispute
resolution mechanisms, their value derives from implementation and
careful balancing of additional State commitments, national security
considerations, privacy concerns, and private-public partnerships.
Although cybernorms discourse has often focused on promoting voluntary
non-binding norms as an alternative to law, legal rules and norms are
not antagonistic concepts. The goal of law creation is precisely the
establishment of norms, and their legitimacy is conferred by creation of
collective behavioral expectations. Most existing cybernorms are built
on bases other than law, such as political agreement.9 Some of these
multi-stakeholder efforts were intended to be as inclusive as possible,
campaigning for universal cybernorms for all States.10 Other initiatives
targeted limited norm development, addressing "like-minded States",
"major powers" or specific domains, such as data protection.11 [The most
known multilateral norm-building efforts in cyberspace are]{.underline}
the GGE process and the [OSCE efforts]{.underline} [to
develop]{.underline} [voluntary CBMs]{.underline}.

TCBMs are policy tools [aimed at mitigating threats,
building]{.underline} [trust, and]{.underline}
[communication]{.underline} channels, and have been traditionally
promoted in tackling international security issues, such as nuclear
non-proliferation or disarmament. Usually perceived as politically
binding instruments, [TCBMs can]{.underline} sometimes be agreed as
legally binding, but they are mainly constructed as a
[bridge]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [future i]{.underline}nternational
[law rules, laying]{.underline} the [foundations]{.underline} [towards
identification of areas of]{.underline} [common ground]{.underline}.12
[Flexibility and openness to understand perspectives of allies and
competitors is both a]{.underline} crucial [condition]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} an [aim]{.underline} [of efficient TCBMs,
as]{.underline} was [demonstrated]{.underline} [by the]{.underline} CBMs
agreed under the umbrella of the [OSCE]{.underline}.13

#### It can [compel behavior]{.underline} even if it's not binding

[Although the OSCE process]{.underline} [cannot force]{.underline}
[States to implement their recommendations, it can employ]{.underline}
[preventive and quiet diplomacy, as well as]{.underline} [results-
orientated dialogue]{.underline} [to find]{.underline} [common
grounds]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [emerging security
challenges]{.underline}.52 As GGE processes share almost overlapping
mandates with the OEWG, [the OSCE can be among the]{.underline} [most
promising venues for multilateral cybersecurity
cooperation]{.underline}. In this regard, [the OSCE's ability to bring
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline} [to the conversation table
is]{.underline} [crucial]{.underline}, and with EU support, it should
strive at engaging Chinese representatives as well. The People's
Republic of China, which takes a similar view to Russia, also
participated in the GGEs, but is not an OSCE member. The preliminary
[conversations should focus on]{.underline} [national
interpretations]{.underline} [and]{.underline} application of
[fundamental]{.underline} international law [principles]{.underline}. To
ensure a candid exchange of views, initial conversations should be held
under Chatham House Rule and avoid public scrutiny.

### Solvency\-\--Cyber\-\--AT: Say No

#### OSCE can [compel members]{.underline} to share information about cybersecurity challenges\-\--despite a divergence in values in the membership.

doi:10.24818/TBJ/2021/11/3.01

Fifth, [as the]{.underline} [coordinating fora]{.underline} for CBMs,
[the OSCE]{.underline}, has [accumulated]{.underline} [political
capital]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [addressing States' reluctance
regarding information-sharing]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [inherent
challenges]{.underline} [that create multi-stakeholder cooperation
problems]{.underline}. During the previous rounds, the OSCE gained an
overview on which objectives can reasonably be achieved multilaterally,
and which ones are more suited for bilateral cooperation mechanisms.53
Deriving lessons learned from past processes enables better approaches
to national interests, concerns, and operational practices.54

[It would be utopic to believe that major powers will agree
on]{.underline} interpretations of [every]{.underline} [legal
institution]{.underline}. Even the experts of the Tallinn Manual Process
could not agree on basic principles, although as mentioned, they mainly
originated from like- minded states and cultures. The first part of this
paper highlighted that the process of norm-creation may matter as much
as the destination, as participants agree to disagree and understand
each other's differences and underlying rationales.

Another important endeavor is the analysis of past and present
challenges of effective implementation of voluntary norms. [The OSCE
should strive at]{.underline} [assisting States]{.underline} [to
recognize the]{.underline} [prospective]{.underline} domestic and
foreign policy [value]{.underline} [of]{.underline} recognizing
[CBMs]{.underline}.55 The reasons why some of the measures were
perceived as being less important, implementation challenges, and
responses within the civil society and industry shall be thoroughly
examined.

The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is sometimes cited as a
possible model for future cybersecurity cooperation. 56 This approach
has been described as a "coalition of the willing" against a global
threat by means of flexible coordination of national and international
instruments.57 The proposed institutional architecture encourages
collective action for a common cause, without requiring legally binding
commitments. This agreement is also recognized for reaching a political
commitment by only a few States, which accepted that they have different
capacities and resources to identify and respond to threats. This
initiative represents a successful example of voluntary cooperation,
first among like-minded States, around enforcement of specific, agreed
norms of behavior.

[The OSCE participating States should capitalize on lessons learned to
operationalize norms in a practical manner]{.underline}, such as was the
case of [the]{.underline} 1990 [OSCE Vienna Document on Negotiations on
CSBMs]{.underline}, which [contained]{.underline} [voluntary military
measures]{.underline} [aiming at enhancing]{.underline} [transparency,
trust building, and arms control. After]{.underline} their [translation
into the cyber realm, these tools]{.underline} departed from the
traditional military components of CSBMs and [adopted]{.underline} [more
cyber diplomacy approaches, bringing both]{.underline}
[likeminded]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [non-likeminded States to the
table]{.underline}.58

#### The OSCE's [extremely effective]{.underline} at creating norm consensus even when members disagree.

4.2 OSCE work and pressing cyberthreats

Part III of the paper detailed why States' recognition of their due
diligence obligations is crucial for early warning, a key element of
OSCE mandate. While the previous section suggested some practical steps
for addressing this principle and other delicate cyber issues on which
previous efforts have not concluded with unanimous consent, this section
will emphasize why the most pressing issues require immediate attention.

First, [the solid inter-state cooperation structure provided by OSCE
should be utilized to build on]{.underline} pre-existing
[commitments]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [strengthen existing
CBMs]{.underline} related to due diligence [and launch
legal]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [political
conversations]{.underline} [on the preventive]{.underline} aspect of
this [principle]{.underline}.59 This process should include civil
society and industry representatives, who can provide fresh insight on
the realistic capabilities of states to commit, on the requirements and
obstacles to full implementation.

Second, [development of agreed terminology is fundamental]{.underline}
for pursuing further dialogue, [as States can identify areas of
agreement and disagreement]{.underline} about the translation of the due
diligence principle from other areas of law, such as space law,
environmental law, or law of the sea.60 The same rationale applies to
divergent views in regard to terminology of "essential" or "critical"
infrastructure and associated concerns. In most views, a cyber intrusion
against ordinary hospitals, patients' databases or laboratories would
not impact national care during ordinary times.61 However, given the
shortages of medical infrastructure during the 2020 pandemic, the
threshold for the "essential character" would likely shift. While an
infectious disease hospital or testing facility are expected to be
considered indispensable medical services during a pandemic, the legal
effects of deaths occurring as indirect consequences of cyber intrusions
remain unanswered.62 Perhaps, the silver lining of recent malicious
cyberoperations is the opportunity for States and multilateral fora to
clarify application of international law, endorse norms, and assert
their credibility.63

5\. Conclusion

[The digital arms race determined numerous States to enhance their
defensive and offensive cyber capabilities, and some already defined
cyberspace as a military domain. The future will tell whether an
equivalent of the "Treaty on Open Skies" is possible in
cyberspace]{.underline}.64 With the same goal, the value of CBMs is
rendered by their mere purpose, to create safe and predictable behavior
in cyberspace, and to build a culture of transparency among
stakeholders. This paper highlighted the value of interregional
cooperation on cybersecurity and the need to institutionalize these
dialogues, to operationalize implementation measures, and strengthen
commitments. Despite their slow pace, CBMs are continuously developed
with every State action or declaration, having a great potential to
uphold international peace and reduce risks of conflict and escalation.
Norms of responsible State behavior seek to define key concepts, such as
"red lines" for the use of ICTs.65 [One of the most important thresholds
is that States make sure that the territory or cyber infrastructure
under their control is not used for operations that affect the rights
of, and produce adverse consequences for, other States.]{.underline}

The 2017 GGE demonstrated that [there are no]{.underline}
[guarantees]{.underline} [of reaching international consensus
for]{.underline} the creation of [norms]{.underline} to secure and
govern cyberspace. [Security threats are inherently transnational, and
their prevention and mitigation will require greater]{.underline}
[engagement]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [commitment]{.underline} from
the international community. [Their successful approach will imply
constructive and open conversations among various stakeholders with
divergent priorities, agendas, and views on international
law]{.underline}. At this moment in time, [progress
requires]{.underline} [continuous compromise]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} the major [powers]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}
[sometimes]{.underline} [express]{.underline} [contrasting
interpretations]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[i]{.underline}nternational [law]{.underline} applicable to cyberspace.
[OSCE's contribution and assistance to constructive dialogue, flexible
understanding of legal views, and creation of national practices that
allow implementation is crucial]{.underline}. This model of cooperation,
the norm-setting and CBMs are a model for other regional organizations
and their image should be defended by continuous efforts.

#### OSCE has an extremely strong track record in cyberspace consensus building.

Cyber Security and CIP

Critical infrastructures are the lifelines of States, and essential
assets. They are profitable businesses and indispensable for citizens.

Keeping them safe is a concern all States share -- no matter what their
stage of de- velopment.

It is in their national interest to optimise processes and procedures to
mitigate po- tential cyber threats that could harm them. Having said
that in times when governments are increasingly investing in cyber
capabilities enhancing national cyber resilience is not only good for
individual countries; it is also a contribution to international peace
and security.

Currently, [forty-seven UN member states have active cyber
programmes]{.underline} that give some role to the armed forces. [Ten
out of the 15 biggest military spenders possess or are developing
offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}.

[Given the importance of]{.underline} [critical
infrastructures]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [national security, it
is]{.underline} more [likely]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [tensions
will flare]{.underline} up [between States over cyber-attacks on
critical infrastructure]{.underline} than any other target or activity.

It comes as no surprise then that [the]{.underline}
[protection]{.underline} [of critical infrastructures is a]{.underline}
[key concern]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [international and regional
efforts]{.underline} designed to enhance cyber stability between States
and to reduce the risks of conflict stemming from the use of ICTs.

For instance, the latest report by the UN Group of Governmental Experts
on Devel- opments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in
the Context of Interna- tional Security recommended that a State should
not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity that intentionally damages
or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure.
In addition, States should also take appropriate measures to protect
their critical infrastructure from ICT threats.

Similarly, the protection of protecting ICT enabled critical
infrastructure has also been a focus of all 57 OSCE participating States
in their agreement on a list of confidence building measures to reduce
the risks of conflict stemming from the use of ICTs as re- cently as
March 2016.

For those less aware of OSCE efforts in this field, [OSCE participating
States]{.underline} [adopted a total of]{.underline} [16 cyber/ICT
security CBMs]{.underline}. They are [designed to]{.underline} [avoid
misunderstandings]{.underline} [and to increase]{.underline}
[transparency]{.underline}; [co-operation]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[stability]{.underline} [between States]{.underline} in cyberspace --
States that often have fundamentally different visions when it comes to
international cyber/ICT security policies.

[The CBMs offer States the opportunity to raise concerns]{.underline}
related to cyber incidents that could affect international relations,
for instance by using the new communication mechanisms that came with
the CBMs. By agreeing to [these measures]{.underline}, States [made a
commitment to]{.underline} ["care" about cyber stability]{.underline}
between States, [and]{.underline} to [work]{.underline} [towards
a]{.underline} [common objective]{.underline} despite ideological
differences.

The protection of ICT enabled infrastructure is an issue that all States
deem of vital importance. Consequently, the latest CBMs added the
protection of ICT-enabled critical infrastructures as a concrete are for
co-operation.

Specifically, States committed to facilitate cooperation between
authorities respon- sible for securing critical infrastructures
including to

> • Develop shared responses including crisis management procedures;
>
> • Adopt voluntary national arrangements to classify ICT incidents in
> terms of the scale and seriousness of the incident;
>
> • Share national views of categories of ICT-enabled infrastructure
> States consider critical;
>
> • Improve the security of national and transnational ICT-enabled
> critical infra- structure including their integrity; and
>
> • Raising awareness about protecting industrial control systems.

The goal of these measures is to both, encourage overall ICT security in
the OSCE region, and in the process establish working relations between
States as part of further enhancing confidence in each other, and each
other's capabilities to deal with such threats.

It is [this sort of]{.underline} [engagement]{.underline} that
demonstrates a State's understanding that a lax approach to protecting
ICT-enabled critical infrastructure could have cascading effects on
interstate relations and fuel potential tensions.

At the same time, it [offers the opportunity to]{.underline} [show
partners]{.underline} [the importance]{.underline} [a State attaches to
stability in cyberspace, and that it also takes the]{.underline}
[necessary steps]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [minimise]{.underline}
the [risk]{.underline} [of unknowingly becoming an accomplice of a
malicious cyber act; or even to become]{.underline} [entangled in
tensions]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [coincidence]{.underline} without
being able to contribute to its res- olution. Imagine, Country A
experiences a large scale cyber-attack. Since the perpetra- tors of a
hostile cyber-attack are difficult to identify for certain, country A
has to guess who is responsible.

Chances are that suspicions will fall on Country B with whom relations
are already especially if some Internet traffic can be traced back
there. A key determinant of how forceful Country A will react will
depend on many different factors. However, I would argue that it will
also depend on whether it is still willing to give Country B the benefit
of doubt.

Country A will question whether this attack is in, or out of character
for Country B by drawing on past behaviours and information exchange.
For instance, what measures has Country B taken to prevent national ICT
infrastructure from being abused by non- state actors to launch a
cyber-attack on a critical infrastructure in another State?

It is this sort of knowledge that prevents hasty and uninformed
decisions that could lead to tensions between the two States. And it is
exactly this sort of knowledge that States are sharing as part of the
CBM process, and on top can now use dedicated channels to raise such
concerns at the diplomatic and policy level.

While all this is going on other States will likely be greatly comforted
by the knowledge that country A and Country B are not only able to
address their concerns but also that those States have the right tools,
mechanisms and people in place to minimise the potential impact of this
attack on third countries.

How will they know? Well as part of the latest CBMs they might have just
initiated closer co-operation regionally and or sub-regionally between
operators of ICT enabled critical infrastructure to develop shared
mitigation plans, and probably would have struck up personal relations
with exactly those people who are dealing with these sorts of inci-
dents.

So far this is in theory. In practice [this sort of]{.underline}
[trusted relationships]{.underline} [between all OSCE participating
States needs to]{.underline} be [build]{.underline} up
[over]{.underline} [time]{.underline} [and through]{.underline} [active
implementation]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the [CBMs]{.underline}.
Confidence does not grow over night and is also affected by wider global
political developments.

Having said that so far [States have]{.underline} [surpassed
expectations]{.underline} [in their]{.underline} [implementation
efforts]{.underline} and [over]{.underline} [75% have implemented the
one or more]{.underline} of the [CBMs. The]{.underline} [voluntary
nature]{.underline} [of the CBMs might be the biggest asset in this
respect]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [peer review]{.underline} [as
well as]{.underline} [peer pressure]{.underline} [may have been
a]{.underline} [driving force in this context]{.underline}.

[Clearly, after having taken a commitment]{.underline} to "care" about
cyber stability between States, [non-implementation]{.underline}
[would]{.underline} [not shine a good light on any participating
State]{.underline}.

[Furthermore, the]{.underline} [politically-binding nature of the
decision may have helped States build consensus in the first
place]{.underline}. It would have been impossible to arrive at a similar
decision on a legally-binding basis.

What's next for the OSCE?

[Following the adoption of the latest]{.underline} cooperative
[measures, work will]{.underline} [continue]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} the [implementation]{.underline} of the existing CBMs
and efforts to fine-tune implementation.

For instance, States are currently considering the development of a
template to en- sure the timely response to requests for assistance by
another State whose critical infra- structure is subject to malicious
ICT acts.

Moreover, work will now also start on so-called stability measures.

To this end, the Chair of the responsible Working Group has invited
States to submit proposals for measures "that contribute to establishing
standards of responsible state be- haviour and help bolster a steady
global ICT environment" to be discussed already at the next meeting in
June.

With this [we are very much touching on normative issues. One could for
instance think whether such stability measures include a political
commitment to refrain from targeting certain
infrastructures]{.underline} -- but this remains to be seen. There
should be nothing political about wanting to protect citizens or to
avoid conflict stemming from the use of ICTs -- a least in theory.

If I were to sum up the status quo I would say that [a lot]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} [happened]{.underline}, [more needs to be
done]{.underline} [and most]{.underline} [importantly]{.underline}
[States need to own]{.underline} [what they have agreed if they want to
progress]{.underline}.

[Organizations such as the OSCE can help along the way and act as
facilitators]{.underline} but as we know they are only constructs made
up of their constituents. [Words need to be followed by
deeds]{.underline}.

Characteristic Features of the Current Situation

The security perception of European states and their citizens,
particularly the overwhelming majority that confined its interests
regionally, has improved during the quarter of a century since the end
of the Cold War and the middle of the current decade. Not even the wars
in the former Yugoslavia, the protracted conflicts in the former Soviet
Union, the secession of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and the annexation of
Crimea could reverse this perception. However, these [protracted
conflicts]{.underline} [have]{.underline} [undermined]{.underline} [the
achievement of new accords]{.underline}, be they documents approved by
OSCE Ministerial Councils, the Astana Summit, or a more extensive
modernization of the CSBM package.

Whereas for some participating states a significant deterioration of the
security situation started in 2008, for many others the sea change
occurred in 2014. Again, for some other participating states the
deterioration of relations began with the so-called Kosovo war of 1999
and was followed by the Iraq war of 2003 (both without approval by the
UN Security Council). However, it would be difficult to argue for them
to be seen as turning points because relations re- turned to cooperation
later. It is certain that [relations between Russia and the West have,
with significant variations, reached a new low]{.underline} since 2014.
[This means that the external conditions for agreeing upon measures
based on cooperation are not favorable]{.underline}. At least one of the
current conflicts, in [Ukraine]{.underline}, [carries the danger of
qualifying as 'protracted' and thus further increases the prospect of
more]{.underline} such [conflicts]{.underline}. Political establishments
in different capitals have interpreted this conflict in different ways.
Hence, [it may still be possible to have working relations irrespective
of some]{.underline} [violations at the top level]{.underline} [in the
hierarchy of international law]{.underline}.

Some participating states are of the view that a rule based
international order cannot exist when there are prima faciae violations
of its foundations such as the territorial integrity or the political
independence of states. Whereas a change of territorial integrity can be
easily attributed to external players, others emphasize the undermining
of the political independence of countries by externally induced or
actively supported measures, like the so-called color revolutions. Those
universal, peremptory norms cannot be disregarded with reference to
claims be they founded on history, ethnic composition or the right to
self-determination. This is independent of whether any OSCE document
reaffirms the norm or not. If this approach is interpreted strictly, no
business can be made between states that violate either of those norms.
As it is highly unlikely that some change could be reversed this would
lastingly freeze relations. Even if this view starts out from the
integrity of the international legal order and thus has internal logic,
it is not realistic to assume that this would be, generally, in the
long-term interest of the participating states. Other [participating
states tacitly recognize]{.underline} the potentially detrimental
consequences of such an approach and emphasize [the]{.underline}
[importance of maintaining relations]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} [security]{.underline} matters, [among the
OSCE]{.underline}. This view can be further differentiated according to
the emphasis made in overcoming the stalemate and covering the gaps.
They can be grouped as follows:

> • Top down approach. Cooperation is impossible as long as a violation
> of basic international legal principles continues;
>
> • Bottom up approach. [Cooperation in select areas must be possible
> irrespective]{.underline} [of violations on other levels]{.underline};
>
> • Opening a new chapter. Create distance between the eventual
> noncompliance with the arms control arrangements and the gross
> violation of the European peace order, and the stalemate in
> discussing/negotiating/agreeing upon new measures and hence make the
> coexistence of the current situation and the opening of a new chapter
> possible.

The various positions go back to the assumption of how the current
tension can be overcome -- (re)creating a cooperative environment in
which the perpetrator could react constructively. The "top down
approach" has been identified with particular emphasis upon deterrence.
However, the term deterrence does not bring us close to an accurate
assessment of the purposeful line to be taken. It is much more of a
roll-back policy that requires the state that annexed and seized
territory to give up and return to the status quo ante. Irrespective of
how desirable this might be, it is hardly realistic to count on or
expect such a development. This results in a certain kind of
'doubletalk' 3 as the participating states actually know there will be
no such return. However, they use it as part of their strategic
communication and will only be ready to sacrifice it for some
compensation. This leads to a gradual increase in the number of
protracted conflicts, lasting stalemates and a crisis of classical
diplomacy where every constructive step is a concession.

The bottom up approach addresses 'technical' arms control matters
irrespective of problems on levels closer to high politics. [This could
make technical]{.underline} [discussions possible]{.underline} on areas
such as compliance [and could fill the agenda of fora established to
address implementation]{.underline}.

[The most constructive]{.underline} (or apparently constructive)
[approach]{.underline} [is the one that separates the implementation of
commitments]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [constructive]{.underline}
arms control [dialogue]{.underline} among the participating states
[irrespective of their current compliance record]{.underline}. Here,
[the smaller technical violations of living up to detailed commitments
under arms control arrangements are not the problem; it is the larger
violations that evaporate trust and confidence. This third option
seems]{.underline} more [preferable]{.underline} [as arms control can be
regarded as]{.underline} ["a means to build trust where it has been
lost]{.underline}" [under the assumption that irrespective of how "deep
the rifts, we must try to build bridges."]{.underline} 4 This was
followed by that the incoming OSCE Troika took the commitment "to
launching a structured dialogue on security and arms control" --
apparently an achievement of the outgoing German chairmanship.5 The
[structural dialogue]{.underline} has [started and certainly contributed
to]{.underline} [professional exchanges of experts]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [spite]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the [fundamental
disagreements on major European security issues]{.underline} that were
impossible to overcome.

Conclusions

[After an interval of more than two decades, military security has
returned to the political agenda in Europe]{.underline}. The illusion
that many have pursued, that security is guaranteed for most European
states, turned out to be unfounded and temporary. [The revival of
military security is at odds]{.underline} [with an arms control
regime]{.underline} that has [not]{.underline} been successfully
[adjusted]{.underline} to the changes [since the beginning of the
post-Cold War]{.underline} era. [Due to the unadjusted]{.underline} (and
partly outlawed) [arms control regime, violations]{.underline} of the
letter of various accords [have]{.underline} [remained
limited]{.underline}. Violations gain significance in conjunction with
crises, real or potential, protracted conflicts and the strategic
reassessment of the importance of certain areas in the application of
the treaties. It is important to closely monitor the so-called 'norm
challenging behavior' as it prepares for norm erosion and increases the
danger of institutional decay. 15 It is irresponsible to create a
situation in which participating states or state parties could mutually
refer to each other's violations of commitments. On a larger scale with
respect to some major conflicts (Kosovo, Iraq, Georgia, Ukraine) this
has been going on for nearly two decades without anybody providing
reasons why one state's violation legitimizes that of another state or,
to put it more bluntly: Why states have to follow each other into the
mud.

In spite of the quest to make arms control measures not only applicable
in fair weather, this request has remained only partially fulfilled.
Some measures have been introduced in the CSBM packages of the early
1990s in order to address this matter. 16 The measures have also been
applied under stressful circumstances, like the so-called Kosovo war of
1999. Still, further measures may be necessary to advance the
applicability of CSBMs in other difficult circumstances.

The [current fora should be adequate to address compliance
matters]{.underline} unless they are being obstructed by some
participating states or state parties. [However, because of their
politicization, some fora]{.underline} ([like the]{.underline} Forum for
Security Cooperation ([FSC]{.underline}) [or]{.underline} the Open Skies
Consultative Commission ([OSCC]{.underline})) [are used for megaphone
diplomacy]{.underline} [in which delegates make statements]{.underline}
[and use harsh rhetoric]{.underline} in order [to demonstrate their
toughness to their own masters rather than conducting dialogue with
their partners]{.underline}. [This, inevitably, reduces the relevance
and usefulness of these fora]{.underline}. Consequently, there are
working bodies like debates on Open Skies in a smaller framework or the
Structured Dialogue, which take the place of the larger fora. They
function as genuinely multilateral fora [even though NATO assembles 29
allied nations]{.underline} from among them. However, [the expectation
that the smaller members will simply accept positions]{.underline}
[about which large parties persuade them]{.underline} [or which are
imposed]{.underline} upon them by larger ones even when it is not in
their national interests, [reflects a way of thinking not shared by
every participating state]{.underline}.

The [current thresholds]{.underline} for notification and observation
[are]{.underline} [too high]{.underline} [and can be
misused]{.underline}. The violation of their spirit can start by not
providing sufficient transparency and then simultaneously mobilizing
units for so-called snap exercises. It is understandable that some armed
forces will have to catch up after a period in which they did not take
training sufficiently seriously and did not allo-cate adequate resources
to defense, like the Russian Federation in the 1990s. However, providing
information on a voluntary basis must be possible in order to alleviate
concerns even if a new set of confidence- and security-building measures
cannot be agreed upon. Such a step would be contingent upon an improved
or at least more relaxed political atmosphere.

It is essential to see that some of the notification and observation
measures were agreed as long ago as 1986 so that they would not be
applicable to the then most frequent Warsaw Treaty exercises using
mechanized divisions. Clearly, many of our concerns reappear faster and
are more vivid when they are grounded in Cold War history. Diplomats
need to know that analysts are well aware that the current heating up of
tension, partially grounded in objective reality, is complemented by the
fact that today's re-emerging adversary is a state that is often
regarded as being identical with the old familiar Cold War adversary. It
makes drawing conclusions rapid and simple without much consideration
being given to the major differences between the two periods.

Arms control has changed a lot over the last decades in Europe. Still,
there are matters in which no change is apparent. There are still
participating states with significantly larger military capabilities
than others. Although all regimes are required to meet the same
normative obligations, the strategic importance of compliance focuses
mainly on a few states. The agreements provide tools to observe eventual
violations of one sort or another. However, there are difficulties in
taking action in the light of detected violations. When Fred Ikle wrote
his seminal article in 196117 concerning the dilemma states were facing
when they detected the violation of an arms control accord by a party
whose participation was essential to the accord, he raised the ultimate
question of what to do about the violator. What means the other parties
have (not in the sense of international law as that is fairly clear)
beyond publicly 'naming and shaming' the violator is open to conjecture.
In the end, expelling the pivotal partner from the arrangement with
reference to its massive or systematic violation does not solve the
problem; it simply gives a free hand to the violator to get rid of the
commitments that it was previously obligated to obey. Fortunately, there
are no premeditated, concerted, large-scale, systematic violations of
strategic significance nowadays and, hence, the unresolved dilemma is
not high on the agenda of interested parties. This is the case even
though some military experts and diplomats, for tactical reasons, may
make attempts to portray the differences as strategic in the area of
compliance with arms control.

It seems, under the current conditions, that there is no chance to
negotiate new, substantive arms control measures. Even those initiatives
that were put on the table have been taken back or meant more for
strategic 'sondage' than anything else. It has usually been a question
of whether there is a resolve to free some small area of conventional
arms control from strategic counter-in-terest on a higher level. This
would require visionary statesmen/women on a higher political level than
the present managers and power perpetuating egoists. However, history
never ends. If there is little chance for new arrangements to agree
upon, states have to decide on what to do next by focusing on the
process and leaving the outcomes for better times. It seems that what is
being done is precisely what may help under the current conditions:

> 1\. Not seeking to negotiate any new document on European arms control
> due to the unfavorable atmosphere and the conflicts that impose
> themselves on European security nowadays
>
> 2\. Maintaining dialogue on a professional level to discuss items of
> relevance
>
> 3\. Decoupling the process of forward looking considerations from some
> of those established frameworks (JCG, OSCC) that have lost some of
> their relevance as fora for professional exchange due to the
> historical burden of formal exchanges
>
> 4\. Keeping watch on compliance in order to prevent further erosion
> and a growing irrelevance of the existing arms control regimes.

The lasting stalemate results in an increasingly busy expert community
trying to address and contribute to its resolution. Most of their
efforts will not bring about immediate results but may contribute to
creating a depot of intellectual ammunition that can be explored when
the opportunity arises.

It is essential to reassess the situation objectively and to conclude
whether the overwhelmingly technical violations can be separated from
the eventual strategic discord. [It will also be essential to
leave]{.underline} the [professionals to gain more autonomy]{.underline}
[so that they can act in the]{.underline} [best interests of their
nations]{.underline} [rather than having to meet the]{.underline}
[expectations of certain groups]{.underline}, [which may wish to impose
their ill-informed positions upon them.]{.underline}

## OSCE NB

### Overview

#### Expanding the war to Transnistria draws in NATO\-\--goes nuclear

Holly **Ellyatt 22**, staff at CNBC, "Could there be war between Russia
and the West? Strategists predict what could happen next," CNBC,
4/29/2022,
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/russia-ukraine-war-should-the-west-prepare-for-war-with-putin.html

"[If there's a border spillover]{.underline} right now,
[we're]{.underline} still [probably]{.underline} most likely [looking at
something like Moldova]{.underline} being vulnerable to an invasion," he
said.

He noted that [Russia has a long history of using "nuclear brinkmanship"
as a way of preventing the West from pursuing security policies that it
doesn't like, with the escalation in hostile rhetoric]{.underline} aimed
at deterring NATO members from making heavy arms deliveries to Ukraine.

Moment of danger

Nonetheless, Ramani noted [the threat]{.underline} posed by Russia
[could become more acute]{.underline} if it felt humiliated on the
battlefield. In particular, military setbacks in Ukraine around May 9
could pose some danger. That's Russia's "Victory Day" --- the
anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat by the Soviet Union in World War
II.

"Putin has had a history of escalating unpredictability if he feels that
Russia is being humiliated in some way \... and if there are major
setbacks, especially on around the 9th \[of May\] then there's a risk of
unbreakable action," he said. "But also there's a logic of mutually
assured destruction that hopefully will rein everybody in."

Threatening nuclear attacks is part of Putin's "playbook," said William
Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.

"Putin enjoys using risks and he thinks he has a much more appetite for
risk than the West does," he told CNBC on Thursday. "He's trying to use
the old playbook of 'if I terrify you enough, you'll back down'," he
said.

"Ultimately, if he uses nuclear weapons, even a demonstration strike,
this would turn Russia into a global pariah," Alberque said. He advised
Western leaders, "We just need to be able to manage our risk and keep
our nerve and not panic when he does something that we might not
expect."

There's no indication that there will be a direct confrontation, Liviu
Horovitz, a nuclear policy researcher at the German Institute for
International and Security Affairs, told CNBC.

"Both the United States and Western European governments have repeatedly
said that they have no interest in escalating this conflict beyond
Ukraine, and I don't see anything suggesting that NATO troops will be
fighting in Ukraine anytime soon."

Still, [if a wider war did break out, "NATO's overall conventional
capabilities outmatch Russia's]{.underline}," he noted. What's important
now is that "all sides should avoid any steps that [could create
misunderstandings]{.underline}," he said --- steps that could [lead to
an accidental and]{.underline} potentially [catastrophic
war]{.underline}.

Economic war

While NATO has shied away from providing any aid to Ukraine that could
be misconstrued as a direct attack on Russia, Western allies continue to
pile on the pressure on Moscow.

Indeed, the economic punishment on Russia has been increasing by the
day, in the form of more sanctions on its businesses, key sectors and
officials close to or within Putin's regime. Russia's own Economy
Ministry expects the economy to contract as a result, by 8.8% in 2022 in
its base-case scenario, or by 12.4% in a more conservative scenario,
Reuters reported.

For its part, Russia has sought to inflict its own pain on European
countries that are, awkwardly, heavily reliant on Russian natural gas
imports. This week it suspended supplies to Poland and Bulgaria because
they refused to pay for the gas in rubles. Russia's move was branded as
"blackmail" by the EU but defended by Moscow.

While a direct confrontation between Russia and the West remains
unlikely, one close Russia watcher said Western governments need to
imbue their populations with a "war mentality" to prepare them for the
hardships they could face as the economic fallout from the war
continues. Those include rising energy costs and disrupted supply chains
and goods from Russia and Ukraine, among the world's biggest "bread
baskets."

"We're likely to see a further escalation of the economic war, because
in some ways, that's a rational and logical move from both sides that
have a very difficult time fighting one another in a direct way because
of the nuclear escalation risks," Maximilian Hess, a fellow at the
Foreign Policy Research Institute, told CNBC on Thursday.

"Russia will cut off gas to more countries, it will increase its ruble
demands, because it wants to ensure the ruble convertibility remains
open, and the West needs to be preparing for this with a full war
mentality, making the Western populations understand that this is going
to have real economic costs and real impacts on the cost of goods, the
cost of living and inflation over the coming years."

"If we don't take this war mentality and apply it to the economic war,
then it becomes a lot easier for Putin to win and have successes there,"
Hess said.

Other flashpoints to watch

After more than two months of war, Russia has expanded its control of
territories in eastern and southern Ukraine, trying to create a land
bridge from Russia via the Donbas region to its annexed territory of
Crimea. But it has also sustained large losses in terms of manpower and
arms.

In the meantime, the West continues to pledge more and more support for
Ukraine, and the country's forces are mounting a strong resistance to
Russian troops, signaling a protracted and bloody conflict ahead. NATO's
chief, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Thursday that the war in Ukraine could
last for years.

Andrius Tursa, Central and Eastern Europe advisor at Teneo Intelligence,
said that against this backdrop, "there is no end in sight to Russia's
war in Ukraine, and relations with the West will likely continue to
deteriorate."

"The [rhetoric]{.underline} in Russia [is already shifting from
statements of fighting]{.underline} the '[nationalists']{.underline} in
Ukraine [to an alleged]{.underline} (proxy) [war with NATO]{.underline}.
[Multiple]{.underline} [flashpoints]{.underline} [could]{.underline}
[further escalate]{.underline} the tensions [with the
West]{.underline}," he said. [Those include recent]{.underline}
[explosions in]{.underline} the breakaway Moldovan region of
[Transnistria]{.underline} ([which could serve as a pretext]{.underline}
[for an]{.underline} [increased Russian presence]{.underline} in the
region) [which could bring the conflict "dangerously close to NATO's
borders]{.underline}," Tursa said in a note Wednesday.

#### Spiraling [Georgia]{.underline} and [Black Sea]{.underline} conflict go [nuclear]{.underline}

and Black Sea Security", Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute Background Paper, December 2018, p. 1-2

[The [Black Sea]{.mark} region [is experiencing a changing]{.mark}
military [balance]{.mark}. The six littoral [states]{.mark} (Bulgaria,
Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine) [intensified]{.mark} their
[efforts to build up]{.mark} their [military]{.mark} potential
after]{.underline} Russia's takeover of [Crimea]{.underline} and the
start of the internationalized civil war in eastern Ukraine in 2014.

[Georgia revised its defence policy significantly]{.underline} after the
fighting between Georgia and Russia in South Ossetia in August 2008.
Since then, Georgia has continued to perceive Russia's foreign policy as
aggressive and a major threat to its security. Georgia views membership
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union
as strategic priorities. Georgia actively participates in and supports
NATO activities in the Black Sea region, which it sees as a means to
ensure stability in the region.

[[The]{.mark} security [environment]{.mark} in the wider Black Sea
region---which brings together the six littoral states]{.underline}
(Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine) [and a
hinterland including the South Caucasus and Moldova--- [is rapidly
changing. It combines protracted conflicts with]{.mark} a [significant
conventional]{.mark} military [build-up]{.mark} that intensified after
the events of 2014: Russia's takeover of Crimea and the start of the
internationalized civil war in eastern Ukraine]{.underline}.1
[[Transnational connections]{.mark} between conflicts across the region
and between the Black Sea and the Middle East [add]{.mark} further
[dimensions]{.mark} of insecurity. As a result, there is a [blurring
of]{.mark} the [conditions]{.mark} of peace, crisis and conflict in the
region]{.underline}. [This has [led to an unpredictable]{.mark} and
potentially [high-risk environment in which]{.mark} military [forces
with advanced weapons, including nucle]{.mark}ar-capable [systems,
are]{.mark} increasingly active [in close proximity]{.mark} to each
other]{.underline}.

In this context, [there is an urgent need to develop a clearer
understanding of the security dynamics and challenges facing the wider
Black Sea region]{.underline}, and to explore opportunities for dialogue
between the key regional security actors. This background paper on
Georgia is part of the Black Sea Regional Security Initiative, a project
launched by SIPRI in 2017 to provide independent data and analysis on
security developments in the region and to promote transparency around
military issues.2 This paper continues by describing Georgia's situation
on the Black Sea (section I), it then outlines recent trends in
Georgia's defence policy, including an overview of Georgia's national
documents (section II), the structure (section III) and deployment
(section IV) of its armed forces, its military spending (section V), and
its arms holdings and acquisitions (section VI), with a specific focus
on their relations with Black Sea security. Conclusions (section VII)
summarize Georgia's position on Black Sea issues.

#### Central [Asia]{.underline} escalates

Beyond that [Moscow]{.underline} was and still [may be equally anxious
that the "[Arab Spring]{.mark}" or some analogue of it might erupt [in
Central Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} where it even publicly voiced its
apprehensions about that in April 2011.\[xi\] [Any such uprising [might
spread]{.mark} throughout Central Asia [and trigger]{.mark} an
[explosion]{.mark}]{.underline} on a scale resembling or even surpassing
Syria's current travails. And there are analysts who have publicly
warned that such a revolution could occur under the inspiration of Arab
events.\[xii\]

Moreover, Russian perceptions of disaster were quickly confirmed as
Libya fell into civil war and as it became clear that Islamist factions
might actually take power in one or more of the affected Arab states.

Russian discussions of the Arab Spring regularly complain that these
revolutions' likely outcome is an Islamist takeover leading to a
protracted civil war or at least civil strife as those forces seek to
impose their vision of a just society on their countries if not
neighbors as well.\[xiii\]

[Since Moscow is currently fighting an Islamic insurgency in the North
Caucasus and fears for one in Central Asia the prospect of
other]{.underline} Islamist victories or [[civil
wars]{.underline}]{.mark} engendered by attempted Islamist takeovers [in
regions [where Moscow]{.mark} still [perceives]{.mark} as [its strategic
perimeter]{.mark} might [evoke]{.mark} profound [nervousness]{.mark} if
not anxiety in Moscow]{.underline}.

II Strategic and Geopolitical Goals

Beyond these compelling domestic reasons for resisting the Arab Spring,
Russia has equally profound strategic objections to Western
interventions in the Middle East.

These include but go beyond the belief that the West deceived Moscow
regarding Libya and used the UN resolutions on Libya to create a
precedent as in Kosovo for a war on behalf of democracy promotion, or,
more cynically, for French access to Libyan oil and gas. If the
democracy virus could easily spread to Moscow's restive Muslim south or
Central Asia, democracy promotion on the wings of NATO aircraft
threatens Russia's fundamental domestic system and great power
interests.

Since 1991 [Russia has professed that any regional strife in and around
its (i.e. Soviet) perimeter not only [exposes it to war]{.mark} or at
least significant threat, it might [also escalate beyond anyone's
control]{.mark}]{.underline} as in Iraq [[and trigger]{.mark} a
[protracted war that]{.mark} could [escalate vertically]{.mark} even [to
the nuclear level]{.mark}]{.underline} if Russia is drawn in.\[xiv\]
Alternatively it could escalate horizontally if it spreads throughout
the Middle East, which Moscow still claims as its strategic perimeter.

Given Moscow's lack of confidence in [Western]{.underline} judgments and
suspicions of its inveterate hostility to Russia, it is hardly
surprising that Russian spokesmen from Putin and Medvedev down have
repeatedly threatened that [intervention]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
Arab [revolutions]{.underline} [could]{.underline} [escalate all the way
up to nuclear war]{.underline}.\[xv\]

In recent years, however, some [observers have questioned]{.underline}
[the effectiveness of the OSCE's work, remarking on the "growing
futility"]{.underline}9 [of]{.underline} the [OSCE as the
EU]{.underline} has [expanded its political and security-related
missions. During the Cold War]{.underline}, a [clear
demarcation]{.underline} [existed between the structure and]{.underline}
[function]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} European Economic Community
([EEC]{.underline}) [and]{.underline} that of [the]{.underline}
[CSCE]{.underline}: [the EEC was a regional]{.underline} [organization
focusing on]{.underline} the [economic]{.underline}
[integration]{.underline} of Western Europe, [whereas the CSCE
was]{.underline} an [informal dialogue]{.underline} process
[promoting]{.underline} [cooperative security]{.underline} measures
[between]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
[Warsaw]{.underline} Pact. In 1993, [the EEC was subsumed under the
EU]{.underline}, which had a more comprehensive mission including a
Common Foreign and Security Policy. Over the past quarter-century,
[a]{.underline} "functional [convergence]{.underline}" has
[occurred]{.underline} between the EU and OSCE. Not only has the EU
expanded eastward into the former Warsaw Pact region, it has
increasingly taken on political and security functions, such as election
monitoring and security sector reform, that had previously been the
province of the OSCE.10 The [eastward expansion of NATO and the EU has
also put the Russian Federation on the defensive]{.underline}. Russian
leaders have argued that "[instead of acting as a genuine
transatlantic]{.underline} [organization, the OSCE has evolved into an
institution that seeks to act as a tool of Western influence, pushing
forward an agenda of excessive intrusion]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
potential [destabilization]{.underline} in Russia's neighborhood."11 As
long ago as 2006, one expert asserted: "[The OSCE is in
crisis]{.underline}. . . . There can be no doubt but that [the OSCE
today]{.underline}, as compared to its heyday during the Cold War, [is
a]{.underline} far [less visible landmark]{.underline} [on the European
institutional landscape than]{.underline} was [formerly]{.underline} the
case."12

This essay will argue that [the OSCE continues to play a unique and
vital role in preventing and containing]{.underline} ethnic
[conflict]{.underline} in Europe and Central Asia, [but]{.underline}
that [its]{.underline} [greatest distinctive strength]{.underline}---
the [capacity to]{.underline} help [foster]{.underline} [shared
political norms]{.underline} [supporting]{.underline}
"[common]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [comprehensive
security"---has]{.underline} [eroded]{.underline} since the late 1990s.
Part I of the essay will discuss the original operating concept of the
CSCE and OSCE, which sought to constitute a cooperative transatlantic
security community through the promulgation of shared norms. Part II
will examine the erosion of the normative consensus between the Eastern
and Western participating States of the OSCE since the late 1990s,
focusing on some Eastern states' distrust for the Western democracy
promotion agenda. Finally, Part III will examine the prospects for a
more robust role of the OSCE in protecting civilians from violent
conflict and mass atrocities, given the increasing tensions among
Eastern and Western OSCE participating States in recent years.

The OSCE Ideal: Community Building Through Norm Formation

Emanuel Adler has evocatively termed the OSCE an "imagined security
community," describing the logic of the organization's founders as
follows:

> \[T\]he OSCE has adopted the view that [you must first let the largest
> number]{.underline} of people [from]{.underline} [different
> states]{.underline} [imagine]{.underline} [that they are part of a
> community; only then]{.underline}, when all have formally and
> instrumentally accepted the institution's shared normative structures
> and practices, [do you socialize their elites and peoples]{.underline}
> [by means of continual diplomatic interaction]{.underline} [and a wide
> range of community-building practices]{.underline}.13

Adler's description of the OSCE community-building enterprise points to
the power of norms not only to constrain or regulate behavior but also
to constitute new communal identities:

> When assessing and measuring the influence of OSCE's practices, [we
> cannot simply look at this institution's regulative tasks or
> short-range activities, because what matters most is the long-range
> effectiveness of its practices and activities]{.underline} [as
> constitutive of]{.underline} community identity and
> [bonds]{.underline} [. . . \[W\]hat matters most is not]{.underline}
> the short-range success of [the]{.underline} mission, [seminar, or
> inspection, but the construction of a foundation]{.underline}
> [for]{.underline} community [practice]{.underline} and behavior.14

[Although it might be tempting]{.underline} to dismiss [the OSCE's
"seminar diplomacy" as an elaborate sleight of hand, conjuring the
illusion]{.underline} [of]{.underline} a transatlantic [community that
remains purely imaginary, this would ignore the real historical impact
of the]{.underline} CSCE/[OSCE enterprise]{.underline}. [During the
1970s and 1980s, the Helsinki Process created a space for the
articulation of human rights claims]{.underline} by dissident groups in
the Warsaw Pact, [which played a role in facilitating a peaceful end to
the Cold War]{.underline}. Since the early 1990s, the HCNM and other
[OSCE institutions have sought to foster "an environment characterized
by shared meanings, trust, increased cooperation, and a sense of common
identity]{.underline}."15 For all the frustrations and setbacks involved
in this project, there have also been important successes.

Of the various component institutions of the OSCE, two are particularly
relevant to the mission of atrocity prevention: [the]{.underline}
[Conflict Prevention Center]{.underline} (CPC), along with the field
operations that it supports, and the Office of the High Commissioner on
National Minorities (HCNM). These will be the focus of analysis for this
paper.

Created in 1990, the CPC "[acts as an OSCE-wide early warning focal
point]{.underline}, [facilitates]{.underline} [negotiation]{.underline},
[mediation]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} other [conflict
prevention]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [resolution]{.underline}
efforts, [and supports regional co-operation
initiatives]{.underline}."16 In its initial years, the CPC focused
principally on reducing risks of interstate conflict among the OSCE
participating States, for example by promoting Confidence and Security
Building Measures such as exchange of military information.

Over the past two decades, [the mandate of the CPC has expanded to
include early warning, situation monitoring, mediation and dialogue
facilitation, and support for OSCE field operations, among other roles.
It supports mediation initiatives in Ukraine]{.underline},
[Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline}, [Transdniestria]{.underline}, [and
Georgia]{.underline}.17 [The OSCE also currently deploys]{.underline}
[sixteen field operations]{.underline} in South-Eastern Europe, Eastern
Europe, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia, addressing issues
including reconciliation and human rights protection in the Balkan
states, conflict monitoring in Ukraine, and the monitoring and
prevention of ethnic conflict in Kyrgyzstan.18

#### The OSCE is being weakened because its core functions are becoming politicized. The CP [refocuses]{.underline} the organization on points of [potential consensus]{.underline}, which creates [virtual spirals]{.underline} for broader cooperation.

The Path Forward: Building Cooperative Capacity for Atrocity Prevention

In an October 2016 interview, OSCE General Secretary Lamberto Zannier
observed that "[the OSCE as a security organization is facing a very
complicated environment," because of the "return of
geopolitics"]{.underline} involving "divisions in Europe that we haven't
seen in a long time," [aggravated by global challenges including
terrorism]{.underline} [along with migration]{.underline} stemming from
violent conflicts [and]{.underline} the effects of [climate
change]{.underline}. Zannier observed:

> [As the OSCE was built in a divided environment]{.underline}
> [to]{.underline} [bridge the gulf]{.underline} [between opposing
> sides, today the convergence]{.underline} [of]{.underline} all [these
> problems is eroding the effectiveness of the tools that were created
> at that time]{.underline}. So we are facing a situation where [we may
> have more division, and the tools that we developed to]{.underline}
> [address]{.underline} the problems coming with [the divisions are not
> functioning]{.underline}... as well as they were. So [engagement,
> creating a space of dialogue in spite of the differences and the
> bitter debates... remains the key task for all of us]{.underline}.42

In the bitter aftermath of the 2016 presidential election in the United
States, where the Russian intelligence services allegedly sought to
undermine the campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in order
to tip the result to Republican candidate Donald Trump, such
[constructive dialogue has become more challenging]{.underline} [than at
any time since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. Having long
complained of Western meddling in Russia's "near abroad" through
democracy promotion initiatives and support for the "Color Revolutions,"
the Putin regime has effectively turned the tables on its Western
counterparts. Russia is alleged to have "cultivated an opaque web of
economic and political patronage" throughout much of Central and Eastern
Europe,43 as well as to have forged connections with right-wing parties
in Western Europe including the UKIP in Britain and the National Front
in France.44 The heated accusations of ill will on both sides have
further narrowed the already constricted avenues for cooperation between
the OSCE's Eastern and Western participating States.

As one scholar has written, [the OSCE is "par excellence, a 'soft
security' institution with extremely few]{.underline}
[material]{.underline} [resources]{.underline} at its disposal."
[Unlike]{.underline} other regional organizations such as the EU and
[NATO, the OSCE cannot exercise]{.underline} [coercive
power]{.underline} [by]{.underline} imposing economic sanctions or
[threatening the use of military force. Nor, in the current geopolitical
environment, can it credibly offer]{.underline} [material]{.underline}
[rewards]{.underline} such as the prospect of EU membership, which
served as a powerful incentive for cooperation by the Baltic governments
in the 1990s. [The effectiveness of the OSCE depends on its ability to
"use its]{.underline} [moral]{.underline} [authority as a]{.underline}
[principled organization]{.underline} and its limited amount of cultural
capital (e.g. technical expertise) [to exercise]{.underline} [symbolic
power]{.underline}."45

In the current polarized international security environment in Eurasia,
it is increasingly difficult for the OSCE to assert universally
recognized moral authority. During the 1970s and 1980s, the CSCE took
shape as a dialogue process between NATO and the Warsaw Pact in a period
of high international tension and distrust, which eased temporarily
during the decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall. To some degree, the
rising frictions between the Russian Federation and its Western
counterparts have returned Europe full circle to the geopolitical
atmosphere that surrounded the CSCE's founding.

[Even in an]{.underline} [inhospitable geopolitical context, the OSCE
can make]{.underline} several [valuable contributions]{.underline} to
protecting civilians threatened by violent conflict in Eurasia:
[conflict prevention, crisis management, cooperative problem-solving,
and the promotion of norms favoring peaceful coexistence]{.underline} of
diverse ethnic and national groups. The remainder of this essay will
address each of these aspects of the OSCE's work in turn.

Conflict Prevention. During the recent period of rising tensions between
the Eastern and Western factions of the OSCE, a number of efforts have
been made to bridge this geopolitical divide and develop more
constructive strategies for mitigating threats of violent conflict. In
2008, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and French President Nicolas
Sarkozy called for a new European security dialogue to discuss post-Cold
War security arrangements.46 In 2009, the Greek Chairmanship of the OSCE
launched a series of dialogues known as the "Corfu Process," which
sought "to strengthen the Organization's responsiveness to conflict in
all its phases," including "early warning, early action, dialogue
facilitation and mediation support, and postconflict rehabilitation."47
These dialogues culminated in 2011, under the OSCE's Lithuanian
Chairmanship, in Ministerial Decision No. 3/11 on Elements of the
Conflict Cycle, which affirmed "the Organization's commitment to
revisiting its approaches to conflict prevention and conflict resolution
for the twenty-first century."48 Among other things, Ministerial
Decision No. 3/11 called for the establishment of a systematic conflict
early warning system and a more robust mediationsupport capacity.
Unfortunately, there has been limited practical follow-through on many
of its recommendations.49

Crisis Management. Some of the most intractable conflicts in the OSCE
region---e.g. those in Ukraine, the South Caucasus, Moldova, and
Nagorno-Karabakh---are located in areas on the periphery of the Russian
Federation where Russia has a strong vested interest in the outcome.
Given the OSCE's lack of material instruments of leverage, the
organization is unlikely to be able to successfully mediate such
conflicts that have become locked into a "security competition" frame.
Nonetheless, it can help contain violence by focusing international
attention on events in the conflict zones, monitoring developments, and
providing early warning of potential escalation. The presence of an OSCE
field mission or visits by the HCNM may also provide channels of
communication between leaders of rival groups, which may help keep a lid
on violence even in the absence of a formal settlement.

In Ukraine, for example, the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has
tracked the living conditions of the 1.8 million IDPs from Crimea and
Eastern Ukraine since 2014, offering recommendations for how the
government of Ukraine and international donors can meet the needs of
IDPs and enhance relations between IDPs and host communities.50 The SMM
issues daily spot reports on security conditions in Eastern Ukraine,
monitoring compliance with the Minsk ceasefire agreements, and "engages
with authorities at all levels, as well as civil society, ethnic and
religious groups and local communities to facilitate dialogue on the
ground."51 Astrid Thors, who served as High Commissioner on National
Minorities from 2013 through 2016, also engaged in efforts to
"facilitate a dialogue between national minorities and the Ukrainian
authorities on issues of common concern." For example, she co-hosted a
2016 roundtable in Kyiv on "Strengthening the Institutional Framework
Related to Inter-ethnic Relations in Ukraine in the Context of
Decentralization." Asserting that "improved policies in the field of
inter-ethnic relations would help to consolidate Ukrainian society and
would increase stability in the country as a whole," the HCNM has worked
to provide a platform for Russian and other minority communities in
Ukraine to express concerns about the protection of their language and
cultural identities.52

In less geopolitically sensitive regions, such as Central Asia and the
Balkan states, the OSCE may have greater potential for robust conflict
prevention and crisis response---but its record in achieving this
potential has been uneven. For example, in May and June 2010, HCNM Knut
Vollebaek issued urgent warnings to the OSCE Permanent Council on the
risk of interethnic violence in Kyrgyzstan, asserting that the situation
represented "one of the OSCE's biggest challenges since the 2008 war in
the Caucasus."53 When violence between ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks erupted
in southern Kyrgyzstan that June, however, the OSCE Permanent Council
displayed no appetite for a robust response. In the words of one
commentator, "The lack of collective will by the participating States
and the Kyrgyz interim government's inability to take substantial steps
in managing the conflict in Kyrgyzstan significantly curbed the OSCE's
room for maneuver."54

Cooperative Problem-Solving. [Even in]{.underline} [geopolitically
contested settings]{.underline} where a comprehensive settlement remains
elusive, [the OSCE may be able to promote]{.underline} [incremental
progress]{.underline} [toward]{.underline} [peaceful
coexistence]{.underline} of rival groups. For example, in Georgia, where
the OSCE field mission was closed down on Russia's insistence in 2008,
the HCNM has "encouraged the effective implementation of the State
Strategy for Civic Equality and Integration for 2015-2020 and Its Action
Plan," and has "continued to support a project to facilitate interaction
between the political parties in the country and national minority
representatives, including by bringing them together to discuss topical
issues on televised talk shows."55 In Moldova, High Commissioner Thors
worked with the parliament to establish a "joint working group with
members of parliament and the People's Assembly of Gagauzia" to improve
"the functioning of the Gagauz autonomy," and she has worked with the
OSCE Mission to Moldova to address cultural and linguistic issues
surrounding the status of Transdniestria.56 Thors also remained engaged
in addressing issues related to citizenship rights, political
representation of ethnic minorities, and protection of minority
languages in a wide range of other countries including Kyrgyzstan,
Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia-Hezegovina, Macedonia, Hungary, and Slovakia.57

Norm Promotion. Over the past twenty years, [the OSCE has issued a
number of statements of principles]{.underline} [regarding]{.underline}
the protection of [minority rights]{.underline}, including the Hague
Recommendations Regarding the Education Rights of National Minorities
(1996), the Bolzano/Bozen Recommendations on National Minorities in
Inter-State Relations (2008), and the Ljubljana Guidelines on
Integration of Diverse Societies (2012).58 In documents such as the
Charter for European Security, adopted at the Istanbul summit of 1999,
it has also reaffirmed its commitment to "preventing the outbreak of
violent conflicts wherever possible" and "to settle conflicts and to
rehabilitate societies ravaged by war and destruction."59 Beyond
affirming these principles related to human security, the OSCE has
sought to memorialize its operational approach to conflict prevention in
documents including "The OSCE Concept of Comprehensive and Co-operative
Security" (2009) and the Ministerial Decision No. 3/11 on Elements of
the Conflict Cycle (2011).60

Scholars disagree about the efficacy of the OSCE's efforts to transform
norms governing relations among diverse ethnic groups in Eurasia. Some
observers, such as Wolfgang Zellner, have argued that the HCNM has been
relatively successful in "de-securitizing" relationships between states
and minority groups by "introducing international minority rights
standards as the frame of reference for majority, minority and
kin-States." The HCNM, Zellner asserts, has facilitated "substantive
short-term solutions with a view towards sustainable long-term solutions
under local ownership."61 Others have taken a more skeptical view: David
Galbreath and Joanne McEvoy contend that "the HCNM's role in societal
security often appears to maintain the status quo 'state vs. minority'
logic of the European minority rights regime," and that the OSCE as a
whole has been unable to transform the "zero-sum context" of interethnic
relations in Eurasia.62

[Despite]{.underline} the [sometimes]{.underline} [disappointing
results]{.underline} of its conflict prevention and crisis management
initiatives, [the OSCE remains a]{.underline} [vital component of the
Eurasian security architecture]{.underline}, both [because of
its]{.underline} [inclusive membership structure]{.underline} [and
because of its core mission to advance "common and comprehensive
security" through a]{.underline} [consensus-based approach]{.underline}.
Yet, for the organization to play a robust role in addressing the urgent
security challenges in contemporary Eurasia, it is essential that its
participating States share a genuine consensus about the importance of
protecting civilians threatened by violent conflict.

One stumbling block to productive cooperation between the Eastern and
Western participating States of the OSCE has been mutual suspicion over
the other side's motives. In Zellner's words, "what the U.S. regards as
democratization, Russia takes as destabilization."63 As Alistair
Miskimmon and Ben O'Loughlin have observed, a profound misalignment has
emerged between Russian and Western narratives about the post-Cold War
order. Rather than being recognized as "co-constitutor of this emerging
system," since the early 1990s "Russia has complained of being excluded
from the major decisions affecting it." Consequently, Russia "feels
mis-recognized," driving a "cycle of miscommunication, generating
frustration on all sides and restricting the scope for cooperation."64

During the 1970s and 1980s, the CSCE explicitly avoided establishing a
democratization agenda, which the Western participating States
recognized as a bridge too far for their Soviet counterparts. Instead,
participants in the Helsinki dialogue process focused on promotion of
human rights and other aspects of the "human dimension" of security, in
an effort to build mutual trust and lay a foundation for a broader range
of security cooperation activities.

[In the current period of retrenchment in relations between
NATO]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n
Federation, [it is]{.underline} [essential]{.underline} [for
the]{.underline} [OSCE to seek areas of common ground that can serve as
a focal point for constructive engagement]{.underline}. [A]{.underline}
[narrowing]{.underline} and deepening [of the OSCE's
mission]{.underline}, [refocusing]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the
[objectives]{.underline} of promoting human security in regions
afflicted by conflict, [might help]{.underline} [rebuild the normative
consensus]{.underline} [between Eastern and Western participating States
and increase the OSCE's]{.underline} [operational
effectiveness]{.underline}.

Prospects and potential

[The relevance of the]{.underline} [OSCE]{.underline}
[depends]{.underline} [heavily]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the
political climate and on [relations among its member
states]{.underline}. [A]{.underline} [substantial increase in
importance]{.underline} [requires]{.underline} [greater
unity]{.underline} among OSCE countries and country groups [with regard
to the]{.underline} [design of]{.underline} the international security
architecture, especially that of [the]{.underline} [OSCE]{.underline}.
[Such a development is]{.underline} [currently]{.underline} [not in the
offing. At the same time, the continued need for]{.underline} the [OSCE
is]{.underline} [clear as well. The]{.underline} [Georgian war
showed]{.underline} that [there is]{.underline} [no]{.underline}
long-term [democratic peace in the OSCE region]{.underline}. Here, too,
[minority]{.underline} [issues]{.underline}, [breaches of]{.underline}
human [rights, and deficits in]{.underline} [democracy]{.underline}
[persist]{.underline}. It is precisely [in these]{.underline} its [core
activities]{.underline} that [the OSCE can]{.underline} therefore [play
a]{.underline} particularly [important role]{.underline}. It is also
possible that the OSCE will gain in relevance on the operational level,
as the EU is presently absorbed with the debt and currency crisis.

After the low point of the Georgian crisis, some [silver
linings]{.underline} [can be found]{.underline} concerning the relevance
of the OSCE. The Corfu Process helped re-establish a basic level of
trust among OSCE member states by encouraging a renewed dialog.
Optimists do not interpret the Astana summit as a failure either, but
rather point out that the OSCE's acquis was confirmed by the heads of
state and government as part of the summit declaration. They also
emphasise that, [after]{.underline} the [de-facto]{.underline}
[suspension]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} [CFE]{.underline} [treaty,
the]{.underline} [OSCE]{.underline} and the Vienna Document [are
the]{.underline} [only remaining platforms for confidence-building
measures]{.underline}. While it is still too early to talk about a trend
reversal, [an]{.underline} [increase in the OSCE's
relevance]{.underline} [cannot be ruled out]{.underline} either. [The
OSCE]{.underline} [itself]{.underline} [could]{.underline} [facilitate
this process]{.underline} [through a]{.underline} [better-defined
division of labour with other security organisations]{.underline} and by
avoiding a dissipation of its thematic focus.

Начиная с конца XIX - начала XX века мировое сообщество начало
предпринимать серьезные шаги на пути разработки мирных средств для
урегулирования международных споров между государствами во избежание
кровопролитных войн. В этом отношении стоит особо отметить проведение
двух Гаагских мирных конференций в 1899 и 1907 годах, по итогам которых
были приняты несколько международных документов о законах и обычаях
войны. Это были первые конференции, собравшие большое количество
государств-участников, на которых на универсальном уровне обсуждались
вопросы международного мира и безопасности.

Возможности усовершенствования того, что уже было начато, вновь
оказались доступны и необходимы для установления нового мирового порядка
по окончании Первой мировой войны. Был достигнут заметный прогресс в
области международно-правового регулирования мирного разрешения споров
между государствами. В частности, стоит отметить возникновение института
санкций с подписанием Версальского мирного договора в 1918 году. В
качестве «санкций» в этом договоре отмечались меры для привлечения к
уголовной ответственности главного виновника в развязывании мировой
войны - императора Германии Вильгельма II. Была учреждена такая
организация, как Лига Наций, а также Постоянная Палата Международного
Правосудия как международный судебный орган, действовавший при Лиге
Наций. Главным призванием Лиги Наций было эффективное поддержание и
обеспечение международного мира и безопасности, с чем, впрочем,
организации справиться не удалось. Эта организация, созданная с целью
эффективного поддержания и обеспечения международного правопорядка,
закрепляла в своем Статуте положения, касательно принудительных мер,
которые можно было бы применить к государству, совершившему
международнопротивоправное деяние1 .

По итогам Второй мировой войны была создана более эффективная и
усовершенствованная система по обеспечению международного мира и
безопасности в лице Организации Объединенных Наций (ООН) с новым
Уставом, принятым в 1945 году. Основной постулат заключался в том, что
государства должны стремиться регулировать возникающие споры мирным
путем, а при невозможности такого урегулирования необходимо применять
механизм по обеспечению международного правопорядка, предусмотренный
непосредственно Уставом ООН.

Статья 1 Устава ООН предусматривает, что одной из четырех основных целей
ООН является следующее: «Поддерживать международный мир и безопасность и
с этой целью принимать эффективные коллективные меры для предотвращения
и устранения угрозы миру, подавления актов агрессии или других нарушений
мира и проводить мирными средствами... улаживание и разрешение
международных споров или ситуаций, которые могут привести к нарушению
мира»2 .

Безопасность, устойчивое экономическое развитие и основные права и
свободы человека и гражданина - неотделимые друг от друга понятия,
которые в целом составляют понятие международной безопасности. На
сегодняшний день угрозой для безопасности выступают не только
международные споры, применение или угроза силой, агрессивные войны, но
и такие явления, как бедность населения, распространение инфекционных
заболеваний, загрязнение окружающей среды, преступность в
транснациональном контексте, а также такой актуальный в нынешнее время
вопрос, как терроризм.

Вследствие этого возникла необходимость научного исследования правовых
аспектов обеспечения международной безопасности, что привело к
возникновению такой отрасли, как право международной безопасности,
которое представляет собой комплекс международно-правовых принципов и
норм, регулирующих международные отношения с целью установления,
обеспечения и поддержания всеобщего мира, а также равной и неделимой
безопасности для всех государств на основе общепризнанных принципов
международного права. Среди этих десяти принципов к вопросам
международной безопасности можно отнести следующие пять: 1) принцип
воздержания от угрозы силой или ее применения в международных
отношениях; 2) принцип разрешения международных споров мирными
средствами; 3) принцип нерушимости государственных границ; 4) принцип
территориальной целостности государств; 5) принцип добросовестного
выполнения международных обязательств, который косвенно относится и к
обязательств содействовать поддержанию международного мира и
безопасности. Данный факт свидетельствует о том, что именно эта область
является одной из наиболее приоритетных в рамках международного права и
требует наиболее детального регулирования посредством
международно-правовых актов и норм.

Международные организации играют важнейшую роль в международно-правовом
регулировании обеспечения международной безопасности. В этом смысле
необходимо отметить, прежде всего, Организацию по Безопасности и
Сотрудничеству в Европе (ОБСЕ). Эта организация является крупнейшей
региональной международной организацией по безопасности, в которой
участвуют 57 государств. Организация была создана в результате
преобразования первоначального Совещания по Безопасности и
Сотрудничеству в Европе, штаб-квартира расположена в Вене. Характерной
особенностью ОБСЕ можно отметить то, что, в отличие от обычных
международных организаций, она была создана на основе ряда политических
решений, а не на основании международного договора, заключенного между
государствами. Тем не менее, ОБСЕ, безусловно, относится к международным
организациям, обладает международной правосубъектностью, что выражается
в способности приобретать международные права и обязанности, принимать
участие в международных отношениях, заключать международные договоры, а
также нести международно-правовую ответственность и предъявлять
международно-правовые требования.

Совещание по Безопасности и Сотрудничеству в Европе было создано в
начале семидесятых годов ХХ века и главной целью ее создания было
создать многосторонний форум для диалога и переговоров между Востоком и
Западом. В рамках СБСЕ в 1975 году был принят Хельсинский заключительный
акт, который имеет важнейшее международно-правовое значение как в
практическом, та к ив теоретическом плане. Главной целью в принятии
данного документа, безусловно, было снижение напряженности и достигшей
недавно своего пика конфликтной ситуации в Европе между двумя
военно-политическими блоками в разгар Холодной войны. По мнению многих
исследователей, принятие этого документа и сыграло ключевую роль в
мирном разрешении этого противостояния. Помимо прочего, в этом акте были
закреплены принципы международного права, которыми государства-участники
должны руководствоваться во взаимных отношениях. Здесь были объединены
принципы, провозглашенные в Уставе ООН, а также в «Декларации принципов
международного права, касающихся дружественных отношений и
сотрудничества между государствами в соответствии с Уставом Организации
Объединенных Наций» 1970 года, принятой резолюцией Генеральной Ассамблеи
ООН3 .

Окончание Холодной войны в начале девяностых годов прошлого столетия
ознаменовало начало новой эпохи и для СБСЕ. Отныне Совещание было
призвано сыграть главенствующую роль в управлении процессами
исторических перемен, происходящих в Европе, а также в реагировании на
новые вызовы, что привело к появлению постоянных институтов и
оперативного потенциала. В рамках этой институционализации по решению
Будапештского саммита стран-участниц СБСЕ было переименовано в ОБСЕ.
Такая трансформация не может носить чисто формального характера и не
ограничивается сменой лишь названия международного института. Перед
европейским сообществом стояли новые задачи по пересмотру механизмов
безопасности, которые были призваны обеспечивать стабильность в регионе
на протяжении многих лет. Теперь организации предстояло адаптироваться к
новым условиям и угрозам. Возникла необходимость, в первую очередь,
пересмотреть прежние принципы Заключительного акта 1975 г. Некое
противоречие, присутствовавшее в этих принципах, оказалось сложным для
быстрого и мирного разрешения. К примеру, с одной стороны, принцип
невмешательства во внутренние дела государства не может служить
оправданием для массовых нарушений прав национальных меньшинств,
проживающих в стране. С другой стороны, право народов на самоопределение
не стоит рассматривать как безусловное право отдельных регионов того или
иного государства на отделение. Такое противоречие в принципах стало
причиной множества этнических конфликтов в девяностых годах двадцатого
века и актуально до сих пор.

К основным задачам ОБСЕ на сегодняшний день можно отнести следующие: 1)
принятие необходимых мер по построению доверительных отношений и
безопасности; 2) осуществление контроля над распространением вооружений;
3) содействие развитию демократических институтов; 4) проведения
мониторинга выборов в государствах-участниках; 5) обеспечение
экологической и экономической безопасности; 6) осуществление необходимых
действий и дипломатических усилий по предотвращению конфликтов; 7)
обеспечение защиты и уважения прав и основных свобод человека4 . Наличие
подобного рода задач еще раз доказывает тот факт, что на сегодняшний
день понятие международной безопасности представляет собой более широкое
явление, чем мирное регулирование международных споров и предотвращение
агрессивных войн. Обязательства государств-участников, касающиеся
международной безопасности, вытекают именно из этих задач и закреплены в
различного рода документах, принятых в рамках ОБСЕ.

Несмотря на то, что ОБСЕ позиционирует себя, как региональная
международная организация, она объединяет государства Европы, Азии, а
также Северной Америки в приложении совместных усилий для обеспечения
международного мира и безопасности. Организация пользуется формулой
партнерского сотрудничества, в рамках которой взаимодействует с
одиннадцатью средиземноморскими и азиатскими партнерами для того, чтобы
разработать и обеспечить применение наиболее эффективных механизмов
противодействия общим вызовам безопасности. Группы партеров из различных
регионов предпочитают разные сферы взаимодействия и успешно пользуются
опытом ОБСЕ в рамках поддержания международного мира и безопасности в
собственных регионах. Так, осуществляется сотрудничество в рамках
осуществления механизмов реагирования на преступления, совершаемые в
транснациональном контексте, разрабатываются меры для осуществления
борьбы с терроризмом, торговлей людьми, разрешения транспортных проблем,
предотвращения и ликвидации всех форм дискриминации, обеспечения
нерушимости государственных границ, безопасности окружающей среды,
формирования демократических институтов, проведения честных выборов, а
также решение многих других вопросов, относящихся к ведению ОБСЕ.

Кроме того, необходимо отметить обязательства государств-участников ОБСЕ
непосредственно в контексте вопросов безопасности. В этом отношении
следует упомянуть Кодекс поведения, касающийся военно-политических
аспектов безопасности. Данный документ был принят на 91-м пленарном
заседании Специального комитета Форума СБСЕ по сотрудничеству в области
безопасности (ФСОБ) 3 декабря 1994 года в ходе саммита СБСЕ в Будапеште.
Положения Кодекса поведения носят обязательный характер для
государств-участников ОБСЕ и служат для развития принципов и
обязательств межгосударственных отношений в военно-политической сфере,
зафиксированные в Хельсинском Заключительном Акте 1975 года, в Парижской
Хартии для новой Европы 1990 года, а также в Хельсинском документе 1992
года5 . Кодекс закрепляет в разделах I -- VI следующие «внешние»
обязательства для государств:

> -- уважать в полной мере принципы ОБСЕ, в первую очередь уважать
> принцип неделимости безопасности;
>
> -- отказ от укрепления своей безопасности за счет безопасности других
> стран-участников;
>
> -- принятие солидарных и согласованных мер в случае нарушения норм и
> принципов ОБСЕ;
>
> -- совместный поиск решений для успешной реализации мер по отношению к
> новым вызовам;
>
> -- отказ от содействия или поддержки государствам, применяющим силу
> или угрозу силой против территориальной целостности или политической
> независимости любого государства;
>
> -- обязательство поддерживать только такой военный потенциал, который
> соизмерим с законными индивидуальными или коллективными потребностями
> в области безопасности, иными словами это можно отметить как в той
> мере, в которой это необходимо для самообороны6 .

В Кодексе оговаривается, что каждое государство-участник может в
независимом и самостоятельном порядке определять свои интересы
безопасности на основе принципа суверенного равенства и имеет право
свободно выбирать способы обеспечения собственной безопасности в
соответствии с нормами международного права. Кроме того, в Кодексе
зафиксировано, что каждое государство-участник имеет суверенное право
принадлежать или не принадлежать к международным организациям, а также
быть или не быть участником двусторонних или многосторонних договоров,
включая союзные договоры. Эти свободы еще раз подчеркивают основы
суверенитета государств7 .

В качестве важной организации по поддержанию международного мира и
безопасности стоит отметить НАТО (англ. -- North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) -- Организация Североатлантического Договора. НАТО
представляет собой военно-политический союз, который был создан в 1949
году подписанием Вашингтонского договора между двенадцатью
государствами. Этот договор, в первую очередь, предусматривал
коллективную безопасность и взаимную защиту стран членов от внешних
угроз. В статье 5-й Североатлантического договора предусматривается, что
каждое-государство рассматривает нападение на одного или нескольких как
на нападение на них в целом и в этом контексте обязуются осуществлять
индивидуальную и коллективную самооборону, предоставляя стране,
подвергшейся нападению помощь, в том числе и военную8 .

Примечательным также является и то, что в данном Договоре определена, в
том числе, и его территориальная сфера воздействия -- территории
государств-участников как в Европе, так и в Северной Америке.
Исследование общих масштабов и основных целей внутренних внешних
преобразований организации свидетельствует о том, что НАТО идет по пути
глобализации интересов и стремится стать как фактически, так и
юридически единственным механизмом в области обеспечения международного
мира и безопасности.

Сама организация провозглашает свою цель как стремление гарантировать
свободу и безопасность своих членов с помощью политических и военных
средств. Однако в то же время, как видно из положений Договора основным
обязательством государств-участников является оказание всякой помощи,
включая военную, в случае нападения на одного из членов НАТО. Такой
подход оставляет неоднозначным ответ на вопрос о том, является ли НАТО
действительно международной организацией в классическом понимании этого
явления, или стоит ли рассматривать ее лишь как военно-политический союз
нескольких государств. Несмотря на то, что организация позиционирует
себя как приверженную к мирному урегулированию споров, допускается, что
в случае если дипломатические усилия не приносят результатов, НАТО
осуществляет военные операции согласно положениям о коллективной обороне
Договора, что является обязательством государств-участников, или
согласно мандату ООН.

\[TRANSLATION\]

Since the end of the XIX - beginning of the XX century, [the world
community has begun to take serious steps towards developing peaceful
means to settle international disputes]{.underline} between States [in
order to avoid bloody wars]{.underline}. In this regard, it is worth
noting the holding of two Hague Peace Conferences in 1899 and 1907,
which resulted in the adoption of several international documents on the
laws and customs of war. These were the first conferences that brought
together a large number of participating States, at which issues of
international peace and security were discussed at a universal level.

The possibilities of improving what had already been started were once
again available and necessary for the establishment of a new world order
after the end of the First World War. Notable progress has been made in
the field of international legal regulation of the peaceful settlement
of disputes between States. In particular, it is worth noting the
emergence of the institution of sanctions with the signing of the
Versailles Peace Treaty in 1918. As \"sanctions\" in this treaty,
measures were noted to bring to criminal responsibility the main culprit
in the outbreak of the world War - the Emperor of Germany Wilhelm II. An
organization such as the League of Nations was established, as well as
the Permanent Court of International Justice as an international
judicial body operating under the League of Nations. The main vocation
of the League of Nations was the effective maintenance and maintenance
of international peace and security, which, however, the organization
failed to cope with. This organization, created with the aim of
effectively maintaining and ensuring international law and order,
enshrined in its Statute provisions concerning coercive measures that
could be applied to a State that committed an internationally wrongful
act.1

As a result of the Second World War, a more effective and improved
system for ensuring international peace and security was created in the
person of the United Nations (UN) with a new Charter adopted in 1945.
The main postulate was that States should strive to settle disputes
peacefully, and if such a settlement is impossible, it is necessary to
apply a mechanism to ensure international law and order provided for
directly by the UN Charter.

Article 1 of the UN Charter provides that one of the four main purposes
of the UN is the following: \"To maintain international peace and
security and, to this end, to take effective collective measures to
prevent and eliminate threats to peace, suppress acts of aggression or
other violations of peace and to conduct by peaceful means \... the
settlement and resolution of international disputes or situations that
may lead to a violation of peace.\"2

[Security]{.underline}, [sustainable]{.underline} economic
[development]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [fundamental]{.underline}
human and civil [rights]{.underline} and freedoms [are]{.underline}
[inseparable concepts]{.underline} [that]{.underline}, in general,
[constitute the concept of international security]{.underline}. [Today,
the threat to security is not only international disputes, the use or
threat of force]{.underline}, [aggressive wars]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} [also]{.underline} [phenomena such as
poverty]{.underline}, [the spread of infectious diseases]{.underline},
[environmental pollution]{.underline}, [crime]{.underline} in a
transnational context, [as well as]{.underline} such a topical issue as
[terrorism]{.underline}.

As a result, [there was a need for]{.underline} scientific
[research]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the [legal aspects]{.underline}
[of ensuring international security]{.underline}, which led to the
emergence of such a branch as the law of international security, which
is a set of international legal principles and norms governing
international relations in order to establish, ensure and maintain
universal peace, as well as equal and indivisible security for all
States on the basis of universally recognized principles of
international law. Among these ten principles , the following five can
be attributed to international security issues: 1) the principle of
refraining from the threat or use of force in international relations;
2) the principle of resolving international disputes by peaceful means;
3) the principle of inviolability of State borders; 4) the principle of
territorial integrity of States; 5) the principle of conscientious
fulfillment of international obligations, which indirectly relates to
obligations to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and
security. This fact indicates that this area is one of the highest
priorities in the framework of international law and requires the most
detailed regulation through international legal acts and norms.

[International organizations]{.underline} [play a crucial
role]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the international legal [regulation
of international security]{.underline}. In this sense, it is necessary
to mention, [first of all]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} Organization
for Security and Co-operation in Europe ([OSCE]{.underline}). [This
organization is the largest regional international security
organization]{.underline}, in which 57 States participate. The
organization was created as a result of the transformation of the
initial Meeting on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the headquarters
is located in Vienna. A characteristic feature of the OSCE is that,
[unlike]{.underline} [conventional]{.underline} [international
organizations, it was created on the basis of a number of political
decisions, and not on the basis of an international treaty]{.underline}
concluded between States. [Nevertheless, the OSCE]{.underline}, of
course, belongs to international organizations, [has]{.underline} an
[international legal personality]{.underline}, which is expressed in the
ability to acquire international rights and obligations, take part in
international relations, conclude international treaties, as well as
bear international legal responsibility and make international legal
requirements.

The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe was established in
the early seventies of the twentieth century and the main purpose of its
creation was to create a multilateral forum for dialogue and
negotiations between East and West. Within the framework of the CSCE,
the Helsinki Final Act was adopted in 1975, which has the most important
international legal significance both in practical and theoretical
terms. The main goal in the adoption of this document, of course, was to
reduce tensions and the conflict situation in Europe that recently
reached its peak between the two military-political blocs at the height
of the Cold War. According to many researchers, the adoption of this
document played a key role in the peaceful resolution of this
confrontation. Among other things, this act enshrined the principles of
international law by which the participating States should be guided in
their mutual relations. The principles proclaimed in the UN Charter, as
well as in the \"Declaration of Principles of International Law
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation between States in
Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations\" of 1970, adopted by
the UN General Assembly resolution, were united here.3

The end of the Cold War in the early nineties of the last century marked
the beginning of a new era for the CSCE. From now on, the Meeting was
called upon to play a leading role in managing the processes of
historical changes taking place in Europe, as well as in responding to
new challenges, which led to the emergence of permanent institutions and
operational capacity. As part of this institutionalization, by the
decision of the Budapest Summit of the CSCE participating states, it was
renamed the OSCE. Such a transformation cannot be purely formal and is
not limited to changing only the name of an international institution.
The European community faced new challenges in revising the security
mechanisms that had been designed to ensure stability in the region for
many years. Now the organization had to adapt to new conditions and
threats. There was a need, first of all, to revise the previous
principles of the Final Act of 1975. A certain contradiction that was
present in these principles turned out to be difficult for a quick and
peaceful resolution. For example, on the one hand, the principle of
non-interference in the internal affairs of the State cannot serve as a
justification for mass violations of the rights of national minorities
living in the country. On the other hand, the right of peoples to
self-determination should not be regarded as the unconditional right of
individual regions of a State to secede. Such a contradiction in
principles caused many ethnic conflicts in the nineties of the twentieth
century and is still relevant.

[The main tasks]{.underline} [of the OSCE]{.underline} today
[include]{.underline} the following: 1) [taking]{.underline} the
necessary [measures to build trust]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[security]{.underline}; 2) [controlling]{.underline} the
[proliferation]{.underline} of weapons; 3) [promoting the development of
democratic institutions]{.underline}; 4) [monitoring]{.underline}
[elections]{.underline} in participating States; 5)
[ensuring]{.underline} [environmental]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[economic security]{.underline}; 6) [carrying out]{.underline} the
necessary actions and [diplomatic efforts]{.underline} [to prevent
conflicts]{.underline}; 7) [ensuring]{.underline} protection and respect
for [human rights]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [fundamental
freedoms]{.underline} 4 . The existence of such tasks once again proves
the fact that today the concept of international security is a broader
phenomenon than the peaceful regulation of international disputes and
the prevention of aggressive wars. The obligations of the participating
States concerning international security stem precisely from these tasks
and are enshrined in various documents adopted within the framework of
the OSCE.

Despite the fact that [the OSCE]{.underline} positions itself as a
regional international organization, it [unites]{.underline} the states
of [Europe, Asia, as well as North America]{.underline} [in making joint
efforts to ensure international peace and security]{.underline}. The
Organization [uses the formula of partnership cooperation]{.underline},
within which it interacts with eleven Mediterranean and Asian partners
in order to develop and ensure the use of the most effective mechanisms
to counter common security challenges. [Groups of partners from
different regions prefer different spheres of interaction]{.underline}
[and successfully use the OSCE]{.underline} experience [in]{.underline}
[maintaining international peace and security]{.underline} in their own
regions. [Thus, cooperation is carried out within the
framework]{.underline} of the implementation of mechanisms for
responding to crimes committed in a transnational context, measures are
being developed [to combat terrorism]{.underline}, [human]{.underline}
[trafficking]{.underline}, resolve [transport]{.underline}
[problems]{.underline}, prevent and eliminate all forms of
[discrimination]{.underline}, [ensure]{.underline} the [inviolability of
State borders]{.underline}, [environmental]{.underline} [security, the
formation of democratic institutions]{.underline}, fair elections, [as
well as the solution of many other issues]{.underline} related to the
jurisdiction of the OSCE.

In addition, it is necessary to note the obligations of the OSCE
participating States directly in the context of security issues. In this
regard, the Code of Conduct concerning the Military-Political Aspects of
Security should be mentioned. This document was adopted at the 91st
plenary meeting of the Special Committee of the CSCE Forum for Security
Cooperation (FSB) on December 3, 1994 during the CSCE summit in
Budapest. The provisions of the Code of Conduct are binding on OSCE
participating States and serve to develop the principles and obligations
of interstate relations in the military-political sphere, as set out in
the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, in the Paris Charter for a New Europe of
1990, as well as in the Helsinki Document of 19925. The Code establishes
in sections I -- VI the following \"external\" obligations for States:

> -- to fully respect the OSCE principles, first of all to respect the
> principle of indivisibility of security;
>
> -- refusal to strengthen their own security at the expense of the
> security of other participating countries;
>
> -- taking joint and coordinated measures in case of violation of OSCE
> norms and principles;
>
> -- joint search for solutions for the successful implementation of
> measures in relation to new challenges;
>
> -- refusal to assist or support States using force or threat of force
> against the territorial integrity or political independence of any
> State;
>
> -- the obligation to maintain only such military capabilities that are
> commensurate with legitimate individual or collective security needs,
> in other words, it can be noted as to the extent that it is necessary
> for self-defense.6

The Code stipulates that each State Party may independently and
independently determine its security interests on the basis of the
principle of sovereign equality and has the right to freely choose ways
to ensure its own security in accordance with international law. In
addition, the Code stipulates that each State party has the sovereign
right to belong or not to belong to international organizations, as well
as to be or not to be a party to bilateral or multilateral treaties,
including union treaties. These freedoms once again emphasize the
foundations of the sovereignty of states7 .

As an important organization for the maintenance of international peace
and security, [it is worth noting NATO]{.underline} (English -- North
Atlantic Treaty Organization) -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
NATO is a military-political alliance that was created in 1949 by the
signing of the Washington Treaty between twelve states. This treaty,
first of all, [provided for collective security and mutual protection of
the member countries from external threats]{.underline}. Article 5 of
the North Atlantic Treaty provides that each State considers an attack
on one or several as an attack on them as a whole and in this context
undertakes to exercise individual and collective self-defense by
providing assistance to the country under attack, including military
assistance.8

It is also noteworthy that [this Treaty defines]{.underline}, among
other things, [its]{.underline} [territorial sphere of
influence]{.underline} -- the territories of the participating States
both in Europe and in North America. The study of [the overall scope and
main objectives of the internal external transformations of the
organization indicates that NATO is following the path of globalization
of interests]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [seeks]{.underline} [to
become]{.underline} both de facto and legally [the]{.underline} [only
mechanism]{.underline} [in the field of ensuring international peace and
security]{.underline}.

[The organization]{.underline} itself [proclaims]{.underline} [its goal
as the desire to guarantee]{.underline} the freedom and
[security]{.underline} of its members [through]{.underline} [political
and military means]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, at the same
time, as can be seen from the provisions of the Treaty,
[the]{.underline} [main]{.underline} [obligation]{.underline} of the
participating States [is to provide]{.underline} any [assistance,
including military, in the event of an attack on one of the NATO
members]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} approach [leaves an
ambiguous]{.underline} [answer to the question of whether NATO is really
an international organization]{.underline} in the classical sense of
this phenomenon, [or]{.underline} whether it should be considered
[only]{.underline} as [a]{.underline} [military-political
union]{.underline} of several states. Despite the fact that the
organization positions itself as committed to the peaceful settlement of
disputes, it is assumed that if diplomatic efforts do not bring results,
NATO carries out military operations in accordance with the provisions
of the Collective Defense Treaty, which is an obligation of the
participating states, or according to the UN mandate.

#### It serves as a [cap]{.underline} on security threats\-\--but [proving the concept]{.underline} through [limited coop]{.underline} is key

Выход исследования «Трансформация многосторонности: вызовы и возможности
для ОБСЕ», подготовленного авторским коллективом швейцарских экспертов
во главе с известным дипломатом Т. Гремингером, под эгидой Женевского
центра политики безопасности по тематике ОБСЕ является закономерным
событием. Оно отражает тот факт, что Швейцария играет активную роль в
продвижении ценностей и важного значения Организации в деле обеспечения
европейской безопасности и сотрудничества. Это вписывается в
традиционный контекст швейцарской внешней политики, основанной, как
указывается в предисловии к книге, на посредничестве и мирном
урегулировании конфликтов. Председательство Швейцарии в ОБСЕ в 1996 и
2014 гг. отмечено важным вкладом в урегулирование конфликтов на Балканах
(содействие в реализации Дейтонских соглашений) и запуск Специальной
мониторинговой миссии ОБСЕ на Украине (СММ).

Особо выделяется в тот период инициативная роль и.о. председателя ОБСЕ,
министра иностранных дел Швейцарии Дидье Буркхальтера в развертывании
высокотехнологичной СММ ОБСЕ на Украине, которая продолжает выполнять
важные функции по сдерживанию кризисной ситуации в регионе и содействию
диалогу между сторонами в конфликте.

Структурированный диалог и новейшие технологии ‒ приоритеты Т.
Гремингера

Ставка на использование новейших информационных технологий в целях
повышения эффективности работы ОБСЕ, ее секретариата, полевых миссий и
операций является «коньком» дипломатии Швейцарии в отношении ОБСЕ. Это
подтверждено и в самом исследовании, в котором указано, что в период
руководства Организацией Т. Гремингером была разработана стратегия
цифровизации ОБСЕ на ключевых направлениях ее деятельности, включая в
том числе системы информационной безопасности, управления, закупок,
мониторинга в контексте полевых миссий и операций.

В наибольшей степени внедрение новейших технологий коснулось Специальной
мониторинговой миссии ОБСЕ на Украине, которая впервые в истории
операций ОБСЕ начала использовать для целей мониторинга в зоне
наблюдения почти пятьдесят беспилотных летательных аппаратов дальнего,
среднего и малого радиуса действия (Schniebel Camcopter S-100;
Delair-Tech DT18; DJI Phanton and Inspire quadcopters) в совокупности с
наземными наблюдательными камерами удаленного действия (24 камеры),
снимками со спутников и наземным патрулированием зон разъединения.
Параллельно с этим для улучшения координации в вопросах мониторинговой
деятельности СММ и оперативной обработки и анализа поступающих с
мониторинговых инструментов данных при СММ были созданы технический
центр мониторинга (ТМС) и центр управления мониторинговой информацией
(IMC) \[Claus Neukirch, 2015: 195‒198\].

Использование новейших технологий в рамках СММ для целей мониторинга
ситуации в зоне конфликта позволило не только повысить уровень
прогнозирования ситуации в данном регионе, но и оперативно принимать
меры реагирования по снижению напряженности на линии соприкосновения
сторон. Полученный ОБСЕ уникальный опыт в применении новейших технологий
для повышения эффективности мониторинговой деятельности может быть
успешно применен и в других кризисных регионах (Афганистан ‒ Центральная
Азия, Армения ‒ Азербайджан). С учетом того, что с прекращением
деятельности Договора по открытому небу страны--члены ОБСЕ не имеют
технических возможностей по «кризисному мониторингу», встает вопрос о
технологической модернизации Центра ОБСЕ по предотвращению конфликтов на
основе новейших достижений в сфере информационнокоммуникационных
технологий и анализа больших данных (блокчейн, искусственный интеллект и
т.д.).

В исследовании важное место отведено усилиям Т. Гремингера как
генерального секретаря Организации по разблокированию деятельности
созданного в 2016 г. Структурированного диалога в качестве платформы для
обсуждения актуальных проблем безопасности и разоружения, мер доверия в
военной области. Сложившаяся ситуация вокруг Структурированного диалога,
который воспринимается большинством государств‒членов как нужный и
полезный, во многом связана с ростом геополитической напряженности, а
также с позицией известной группы стран, нежелающих рассматривать эту
платформу в качестве приоритетной и пытающихся подменить общую
позитивную повестку конфронтационной тематикой «гибридных угроз».
Перспективы реанимации Диалога швейцарские эксперты видят в расширении
неформального пространства вокруг Структурированного диалога путем
вовлечения конструктивных политических, общественных и научных кругов, а
также формирования единой позитивной повестки и продвижения концепции
«кооперативной безопасности», разработанной исследовательскими центрами
и фондами Швейцарии и Германии (Центр политики безопасности в Цюрихе и
Фонд Фридриха Эберта).

Аргументы в пользу концепции «кооперативной безопасности»

В поддержку диалога сквозь призму «кооперативной безопасности» в
исследовании выдвинуты следующие аргументы.

> ‒ Данная концепция выходит за рамки геополитического соперничества и
> противостояния военно-политических блоков на основе стратегий
> устрашения; она направлена в первую очередь на конструктивное и
> равноправное сотрудничество в решении приоритетных национальных и
> трансграничных проблем (климатические изменения, деградация окружающей
> среды, пандемии, контроль над ядерным оружием и другим ОМУ, масштабная
> миграция, трансграничная преступность, регулирование воздействия новых
> технологий и искусственного интеллекта, киберпреступность и т.д.).
>
> ‒ Особую привлекательность концепция будет иметь для средних и малых
> государств Европы, в том числе нейтральных, поскольку отпадает
> необходимость ассоциации или членства в том или ином союзе или
> военно-политическом блоке.
>
> ‒ Реализация концепции будет содействовать гармонизации интересов
> различных стран на основе выработки общей позитивной повестки дня по
> ключевым направлениям деятельности ОБСЕ и позволит более четко
> сформулировать реалистическую стратегию Организации в сфере
> обеспечения безопасности, предотвращения и урегулирования конфликтов,
> оперативного реагирования на новые вызовы безопасности и стабильности
> \[Operational Document, 2019: 43‒46\].

Концепция «кооперативной безопасности», предусматривающая расширение
неформального пространства Структурированного диалога, может дать
импульс возобновлению Диалога и формированию позитивной повестки в его
рамках для обсуждения проблем европейской безопасности, предотвращения и
урегулирования конфликтов и принятию коллективных и скоординированных
мер по реагированию на новые вызовы безопасности и стабильности в
Европе. Однако для этого потребуются усилия по созданию тематических
диалоговых платформ в рамках ОБСЕ для сотрудничества неформальных
участников Диалога и государственных структур, отвечающих за принятие
политических решений.

Стратегия партнерства ОБСЕ с международными организациями

Одним из показателей уровня влияния и авторитета региональной
организации является эффективность ее сотрудничества и партнерства с ООН
и другими международными и региональными институтами в соответствии с
Главой VII Устава ООН. Как вытекает из данного исследования, с приходом
к руководству Организацией Т. Гремингера произошли качественные
изменения в стратегии партнерства ОБСЕ с ООН и другими международными и
региональными организациями. В первую очередь они были связаны с
углублением сотрудничества с ООН. Было расширено рамочное соглашение
ОБСЕ и ООН от 1993 г., а также заключены дополнительные соглашения с
рядом важных специализированных организаций системы ООН ‒ Верховным
Комиссаром ООН по делам беженцев(UNHCR), Программой ООН по развитию
(UNDP), Офисом ООН по контролю над наркотиками и преступностью (UNODC),
а также с департаментом Секретариата ООН по поддержке полевых операций
(DFS).

Составной частью стратегии партнерства ОБСЕ и ведущих международных
организаций стало учреждение представительств ОБСЕ при штаб-квартире ООН
в Нью-Йорке, ее региональных отделениях в Женеве и Вене, а также при ЕС
в Брюсселе и Совете Европы в Страсбурге. Развертывание глобальной
инфраструктуры представительств объясняется необходимостью повышения
уровня координации программной деятельности ОБСЕ с международными
организациями и получением дополнительных внебюджетных ресурсов в рамках
такого сотрудничества (в исследовании отмечается, что, благодаря
сотрудничеству с ООН и ее закупочными службами, Организация получила
прямой выход на крупнейшую технологическую компанию «Майкрософт», что
позволило ей сэкономить миллионы долларов на закупках программного
обеспечения и оборудования для своих нужд) \[Cooperation with
international organization, 2016: 1‒4\].

В рамках стратегии партнерства дальнейшее развитие получило
сотрудничество ОБСЕ с Евросоюзом на основе объединения и координации
программной деятельности ОБСЕ и ЕС на Западных Балканах, а также в
регионах Центральной Азии и Южного Кавказа. Преимущество такого подхода
авторы исследования видят в рациональном разделении труда между двумя
партнерами ‒ «ОБСЕ предоставляет нейтральный статус, инфраструктуру
своего представительства в данных регионах, обширные связи с местными
политическими элитами и экспертизу, а ЕС ‒ политический вес и
значительные финансовые ресурсы» (вместе с тем такая модель программного
сотрудничества создает дополнительные преимущества для ЕС, поскольку
позволяет Брюсселю использовать « нейтральный имидж» ОБСЕ для реализации
своих долгосрочных целей в данных регионах) \[Щербак, 2019: 111‒115\].

\[TRANSLATION\]

The publication of the study \"Transforming Multilateralism: Challenges
and Opportunities for the OSCE\", prepared by a team of Swiss experts
led by the well-known diplomat T. Greminger, under the auspices of the
Geneva Center for Security Policy on OSCE issues, is a natural event. It
reflects the fact that Switzerland plays an active role in promoting the
values and importance of the Organization in ensuring European security
and cooperation. This fits into the traditional context of Swiss foreign
policy, which is based, as indicated in the preface to the book, on
mediation and peaceful conflict resolution. Switzerland\'s chairmanship
of the OSCE in 1996 and 2014 was marked by an important contribution to
the settlement of conflicts in the Balkans (assistance in the
implementation of the Dayton Agreements) and the launch of the OSCE
Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (SMM).

At that time, [the initiative role of the OSCE]{.underline} Acting
Chairman, Swiss Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter in the deployment of
the high-tech OSCE SMM in Ukraine, which [continues to perform important
functions]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [contain]{.underline} the
[crisis]{.underline} situation [in the region]{.underline} [and promote
dialogue between]{.underline} the [parties to the conflict]{.underline},
was particularly highlighted.

Structured dialogue and the latest technologies-T. Greminger\'s
priorities

Focusing on the use of the latest information technologies to improve
the effectiveness of the OSCE, its secretariat, field missions and
operations is the\" skate \" of Swiss diplomacy towards the OSCE. This
is also confirmed in the study itself, which indicates that during the
leadership of the Organization, T. Greminger developed a strategy for
digitalization of the OSCE in key areas of its activities, including
information security, management, procurement, and monitoring systems in
the context of field missions and operations.

The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine was most affected by the
introduction of the latest technologies, which for the first time in the
history of OSCE operations began using almost fifty long-range,
medium-range and short-range unmanned aerial vehicles (Schniebel
Camcopter S-100; Delair-Tech DT18; DJI Phantom and Inspire quadcopters)
for monitoring purposes in the observation zone. with ground-based
remote surveillance cameras (24 cameras), satellite imagery, and
ground-based patrolling of the separation zones. At the same time, a
technical monitoring center (TMC) and a monitoring Information
management center (IMC) were established under the SMM to improve
coordination in the SMM\'s monitoring activities and operational
processing and analysis of data received from monitoring tools \[Claus
Neukirch, 2015: 195-198\].

The use of state-of-the-art technologies within the SMM for monitoring
the situation in the conflict zone made it possible not only to increase
the level of forecasting the situation in this region, but also to
quickly take response measures to reduce tension on the line of contact
of the parties. The unique experience gained by the OSCE in applying the
latest technologies to improve the effectiveness of monitoring
activities can be successfully applied in other crisis regions
(Afghanistan ‒ Central Asia, Armenia-Azerbaijan). Given the fact that
with the termination of the Open Skies Treaty, OSCE member states do not
have the technical capabilities for \"crisis monitoring\", the question
arises of technological modernization of the OSCE Center for Conflict
Prevention based on the latest achievements in the field of information
and communication technologies and big data analysis (blockchain,
artificial intelligence, etc.).

In the study, an important place is given to the efforts of T.
Greminger, as Secretary General of the Organization, to unblock the
activities of the Structured Dialogue established in 2016 as a platform
for discussing topical issues of security and disarmament, as well as
confidence-building measures in the military field. The current
situation around a Structured Dialogue, which is perceived by the
majority of member states as necessary and useful, is largely due to the
growing geopolitical tensions, as well as the position of a certain
group of countries that do not want to consider this platform as a
priority and trying to replace the overall positive agenda with a
confrontational theme of \"hybrid threats\". Swiss experts see prospects
for reanimating the Dialogue in expanding the informal space around
Structured Dialogue by involving constructive political, public and
scientific circles, as well as forming a single positive agenda and
promoting the concept of \"cooperative security\" developed by research
centers and foundations in Switzerland and Germany (the Center for
Security Policy in Zurich and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation).

Arguments in favor of [the concept of \"cooperative
security\"]{.underline}

In support of dialogue through the prism of \"cooperative security\",
the study puts forward the following arguments.

> ‒ This concept [goes]{.underline} [beyond]{.underline}
> [geopolitical]{.underline} [rivalry]{.underline} [and confrontation
> between military]{.underline} and political [blocs based on
> deterrence]{.underline} strategies; [it is]{.underline} primarily
> [aimed at]{.underline} constructive and equal
> [cooperation]{.underline} [in solving]{.underline}
> [priority]{.underline} national and [cross-border
> problems]{.underline} ([climate change, environmental]{.underline}
> [degradation, pandemics, control of nuclear weapons]{.underline}
> [and]{.underline} other [WMD]{.underline}, [large-scale
> migration]{.underline}, [cross-border crime]{.underline},etc.).
> [regulation of the impact of]{.underline} [new
> technologies]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [a]{.underline}rtificial
> [i]{.underline}ntelligence, [cybercrime]{.underline}, etc.).
>
> ‒ The concept will be particularly attractive for medium and small
> European states, including neutral ones, since there is no need for
> association or membership in a particular union or military-political
> bloc.
>
> ‒ The [implementation]{.underline} [of the concept will
> help]{.underline} to [harmonize]{.underline} [the interests of
> different countries]{.underline} [by developing a common positive
> agenda in]{.underline} [key areas of OSCE activity]{.underline} and
> will allow us to more clearly formulate a realistic strategy of the
> Organization in the field of security, conflict prevention and
> resolution, and rapid response to new challenges to security and
> stability \[Operational Document, 2019: 43-46\].

[The concept]{.underline} of \"cooperative security\", which provides
for the expansion of the informal space of Structured Dialogue, [can
give impetus to the resumption of Dialogue]{.underline} [and the
formation of a positive agenda]{.underline} within it [for discussing
European security]{.underline} issues, [conflict prevention
and]{.underline} [resolution, and taking collective and coordinated
measures]{.underline} [to respond to new challenges to security and
stability]{.underline} in Europe. [However, this will require efforts to
establish thematic dialogue platforms within]{.underline} the
[OSCE]{.underline} for cooperation between informal participants in the
Dialogue and State structures responsible for political decision-making.

OSCE Partnership Strategy with International organizations

One of the indicators of the level of influence and authority of a
regional organization is the effectiveness of its cooperation and
partnership with the UN and other international and regional
institutions in accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter. As
follows from this study, since T. Greminger took over the leadership of
the Organization, there have been qualitative changes in the strategy of
partnership of the OSCE with the UN and other international and regional
organizations. First of all, they were related to the deepening of
cooperation with the UN. The 1993 OSCE-UN Framework Agreement was
expanded. as well as additional agreements with a number of important
specialized organizations of the UN system ‒ the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR), the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Office for Drug and Crime Control
(UNODC), as well as with the Department of Field Operations Support of
the UN Secretariat (DFS).

The establishment of OSCE representative offices at the UN headquarters
in New York, its regional offices in Geneva and Vienna, as well as to
the EU in Brussels and the Council of Europe in Strasbourg has become an
integral part of the partnership strategy of the OSCE and leading
international organizations. The deployment of the global representation
infrastructure is explained by the need to increase the level of
coordination of OSCE programme activities with international
organizations and to obtain additional extra-budgetary resources in the
framework of such cooperation (the study notes that, thanks to
cooperation with the UN and its procurement agencies, Thus, the
Organization gained direct access to the largest technology company
Microsoft, which allowed it to save millions of dollars on the purchase
of software and equipment for its needs) \[Cooperation with
international organization, 2016: 1-4\].

Within the framework of the partnership strategy, cooperation between
the OSCE and the European Union was further developed by combining and
coordinating OSCE and EU program activities in the Western Balkans, as
well as in the regions of Central Asia and the South Caucasus. The
authors of the study see the advantage of this approach in a rational
division of labor between the two partners ‒ \"[the OSCE provides a
neutral status, the infrastructure of its representation in these
regions]{.underline}, extensive connections with local political elites
and expertise, and the EU ‒ political weight and significant financial
resources\" (at the same time, this model of programmatic cooperation
creates additional advantages for the EU, because it allows Brussels to
use the OSCE\'s \"neutral image\" to achieve its long-term goals in
these regions) \[Shcherbak, 2019: 111-115\].

The positive side of the new strategy is that it is aimed, among other
things, at taking into account the interests of regional organizations
that have emerged in the post -- Soviet space ‒ the CIS, CSTO, SCO and
EEU-and developing cooperation with them in the future based on the
coincidence of interests. The study emphasizes that [there are good
prospects for developing]{.underline} [cooperation]{.underline} [with
these]{.underline} regional [organizations, including in the areas of
economic]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [military-political]{.underline}
[cooperation, joint fight against terrorism and aggressive
extremism]{.underline}. [However, so far this]{.underline} partnership
[is]{.underline} [limited]{.underline} [to]{.underline} joint
[conferences]{.underline}, regular meetings of experts and managers of
these organizations. [The transition of this cooperation to more
advanced]{.underline} [forms of partnership]{.underline} based on joint
program activities [may become possible]{.underline} if the targeted
extra-budgetary funding [from]{.underline} these organizations increases
for the [implementation of joint projects]{.underline} [with the
OSCE]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [priority areas]{.underline}
\[Greminger, 2021: 28-38\].

### Impact\-\--Ethnic Conflict

#### Extinction

Kimon **Valaskakis 14**, Former Canadian Ambassador to the OECD,
"Separatism Everywhere: The New Global Epidemic," Huffington Post,
03/19/14,
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kimon-valaskakis/separatism-everywhere-the_b_4977800.html>

Like modern marriages, half of which end in divorce, [there is
[a]{.mark} new and ominous [global threat:]{.mark} the break-up
of]{.underline} previously stable [political entities through
[separatism]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Crimea wants to leave Ukraine. Scotland has scheduled a]{.underline}n
independence [referendum]{.underline} from Britain in September 2014
[and Britain is considering]{.underline} one [to possibly leave
Europe]{.underline} in 2015. [Catalonia\'s referendum to
secede]{.underline} from Spain [is in November]{.underline} 2014, [and
Quebec may]{.underline} possibly [organize its own]{.underline} in the
next couple of years. [Wallonie, Corsica, North Italy, Bretagne etc. may
one day follow suit.]{.underline} There is even talk of splitting
California in two!

[Why are these centrifugal forces emerging now? There seems to be four
leading reasons.]{.underline}

[The first is a knee jerk reaction against]{.underline} excessive and
[unregulated globalization]{.underline} which leaves the ordinary
citizen lost and with no identity. He therefore seeks a new sense of
belongingness in a small, newly independent country, favoring localism
over globalism.

The [second]{.underline} is the fact that [most]{.underline} so called
[\'nation\' states are actually multinational and diverse]{.underline}.
The [ethnic minorities]{.underline} which feel oppressed in such states,
are tempted to [seek a divorce]{.underline}, set up their own nation,
where they are will then be the majority \-- and perhaps, in the
process, exact revenge on their former tormentors, now in the minority.

The [third is the worldwide failure of national
governments]{.underline}, who seem to be chronically unable [to deliver
on]{.underline} their [electoral promises]{.underline}. One response is
to \'throw the rascals out\', which explains why governments of the
left, right and center are regularly kicked out of office at the next
election. In the U.S., an irate electorate consistently punishes the
governing parry at the mid-terms regardless of its ideology.

An alternative response to ineffective governance is to seek
independence, whenever there is a geographical concentration of like
minded opponents to a central regime. This was what the U.S. Civil War
was all about and is what many contemporary ethnic struggles are leading
towards.

[Fourth]{.underline} and finally, [there is simple self interest. Rich
provinces]{.underline}, in a country, whose constitution obliges them to
help poorer ones, (like Canada) may [want to end]{.underline} these
[subsidies]{.underline} and keep all the money to themselves. Under this
logic it should be Alberta rather than Quebec considering secession.

When all is said and done, is all this good or bad news ?

At first blush, by invoking the principle of self-determination, the
virtues of decentralization and more responsible local government, we
might be tempted to welcome these centrifugal forces.

But upon reflection and careful analysis we should instead fear them
because [[they will exacerbate]{.underline}]{.mark} the present
[[mismanagement of our planet]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The separatists often believe that they can repeal globalization by a
simple declaration of sovereignty, the adoption of a new flag and
national anthem and by being awarded a seat in the United Nations.

This, unfortunately is a delusion.

Globalization is fueled by international capital, labor and technology
movements, the internet, global finance and powerful worldwide networks
\-- some visible, others covert. Multinational corporations are going to
remain global, and so are mafias, narco-cartels, organized crime,
jihadists etc.

If all the separatist movements in the world were to succeed, we could
move from a present world of under 200 countries to one of over 1,000
\-- all with an equal seat at the UN. Can you imagine how difficult it
would be to decide on anything in a 1,000 strong UN general assembly?
[[Think]{.underline}]{.mark}, also, [[of]{.mark} the balance of power:
[1,000 fragmented]{.mark} small [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, plus
their subnational governments, [[competing]{.mark} for the favors of a
dozen huge unregulated global conglomerates]{.underline}. It would be an
embarrassment of riches for the footloose conglomerates. [[It
would]{.mark} also [be Eldorado for]{.mark} organized crime,
[jihadists]{.mark}, tax evaders [and]{.mark} assorted [criminals]{.mark}
vaulting from jurisdiction to jurisdiction]{.underline}.

The sociologist, Daniel Bell once remarked,in the 1970s, that the nation
state had become too big for the small problems and too small for the
big ones. His words were prophetic but they cut both ways. [National
[governments]{.mark} can no longer [cope with pandemics]{.mark}, global
[warming]{.mark}, international [terrorism, unregulated global
finance]{.mark} \-- unless they act [in unison]{.mark} in
intergovernmental organizations. But]{.underline}, by the same token,
[Lilliputian [micro states]{.mark}, emerging from the global separatist
wave, [would be]{.mark} even be [less capable]{.mark} to deal with these
problems. Global governance would then be completely controlled by the
remaining, still international, private networks. A scary scenario to be
sure]{.underline}.

Does that mean we must stay put and freeze present borders in
perpetuity. No, obviously not. Re-arrangements and restructuring are
necessary. But the more sustainable answer may be in new forms of
federalism rather than in the pure multiplication of sovereignties.

In today\'s interdependent world, sovereignty is an illusion except if
you are a superpower. The problems are too big while the means available
to the new so-called \'sovereign\' government are too small.

The [[\'balkanization\']{.underline}]{.mark} of Eastern and Southern
Europe [[after the First World War, led to the
Second]{.underline}]{.mark} World War.

The [balkanization]{.underline} of the world [through [wide-spread
separatism could increase the probability of a third]{.mark}
one]{.underline}. Not an inspiring scenario.

### Impact\-\--Ethnic Conflict\-\--AT: Defense

#### Restraints have [evaporated]{.underline}\-\--states will [violently]{.underline} disintegrate and [draw in]{.underline} nuclear powers

European Studies and Lecturer of International and Area Studies at the
University of California, Berkeley, "Ethnic Conflict in Georgia: What
Lies Ahead", 4-17, http://rpgp. berkeley.edu/node/87

Ironically, [[at the]{.mark} same [time that]{.mark} the
[demands]{.mark} of exclusive cultural groups [for]{.mark}]{.underline}
state sovereignty and \"national [[self-determination\" escalate around
the globe, support for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [international [legal
norms]{.mark}]{.underline} of established state sovereignty and
non-intervention [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[disappeared]{.mark}.
Together, [these]{.mark} two [trends are dangerously explosive. We are
likely to see more oppression]{.mark} of minorities in ethnically
defined states, more slaughter of]{.underline} innocent
[civilians]{.underline} caught [in cultural conflicts, the]{.underline}
continued [[violent breakup of]{.underline}]{.mark} sovereign
[[countries, and]{.mark} more [invasions]{.mark}]{.underline} and
occupation of disputed territory, [as powerful
countries\--nursing]{.underline} other [resentments and
fears]{.underline} against one another\--seize [the opportunity to take
sides. It will]{.underline} thus [not be long until nuclear powers end
up confronting one another. [The]{.mark} absurd [trigger
for]{.mark}]{.underline} this [[conflict will be]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [nationalist demands of [ethnic]{.mark} and sectarian political
[entrepreneurs]{.mark}]{.underline}\--who are often just thugs in
disguise. Note the timing of the U.S. announcement of a missile defense
pact with Poland, as Russian tanks rolled through Georgia to halt
Georgia\'s military incursion into Ossetian territory. [[Unless we
act]{.mark} quickly]{.underline} to reach wider international agreement
on global solutions to violent cultural disputes, more exclusive
[[territorial claims]{.mark} of small]{.underline} and distinct cultural
[groups and violent responses]{.underline} to those claims [[will suck
nuclear powers into]{.mark} deadly [international
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Sparks terrorism and ethnic conflict\-\--goes global

Editor's Note: Today\'s special feature lays the foundations for our
week-long look at how separatist and [[secessionist movements
may]{.underline}]{.mark} be [[impact]{.underline}]{.mark}ing upon
[regional and [global security dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline}, both now
and in the future. Indeed, as a counter to last week's state-centric
meditation on grand strategy, we present today excerpts from Simone
Florio\'s \"The Fragmentation of Geopolitical Space: What Secessionist
Movements Mean to the Present-day State System.\" [The
article]{.underline} not only charts the growing clamor for political
secession since the end of the Cold War, it also [explores]{.underline}
its [deeper implications for international security]{.underline}. In
doing so, it then sets the stage for a follow-on series of case studies
[on secessionist movements in Europe, China and the wider Middle
East]{.underline}.

The last century witnessed an extraordinary multiplication of sovereign
states. Epochal changes such as the dissolution of 20th century empires,
the decolonization process, and the end of the Cold War determined the
division of the world landscape into nearly two hundred separate
polities. But [[the trend to geopolitical fragmentation]{.mark} still
[has momentum]{.mark}: partially recognized and de facto states
constitute a big challenge for international order, while a conspicuous
number of [active secessionist projects]{.mark} continue to
[threaten]{.mark} the [territorial integrity of many
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. This article reviews the complex
questions that the trend to geopolitical fragmentation is posing to
global society, reviewing a number of normative secession theories and
evidencing in them a more hospitable approach to new state formation.
Given the current regime of sovereign states, framing a global approach
to the problems posed by separatist groups seems almost inconceivable;
for the time being, it seems likely instead that the international
community will continue accepting new states on a case-by-case basis,
often in response to Great Power interests or non-negotiable nationalist
projects, without advancing international law on state creation or
global standards of statehood as a whole. This article provides support
for the claim that adopting a global perspective and more functional
attitudes towards geopolitical restructuring are paramount for
effectively dealing with violence deriving from the clash of nationalist
separatist drives and state-centric conservatism.

The Fragmentation of Geopolitical Space: What Secessionist Movements
Mean to the Present-Day State System

Throughout the last century, the society of sovereign nations has grown
steadily, giving rise -- for distinct reasons and under different
modalities -- to our present-day international structure comprised of
almost 200 sovereign states, the primary geopolitical units of the world
system. Epochal changes in the international order, such as the
disintegration of European empires in the early 20th century, the
decolonization process, and lastly the end of the Cold War, brought
about an extraordinary proliferation of independent states: during the
past twenty years, full independence was accorded -- through United
Nations membership -- to twenty-five former sub-state entities. Although
such major geopolitical reconfiguration undoubtedly followed events of
an exceptional nature, these events have severely destabilized the idea
(dominant in the second half of last century) that international borders
should not -- or could not -- be modified to create new states. As is
widely acknowledged, this is nowadays achieved mainly by way of
secession, intended as the process by which a political community seeks
to detach part of an existing state in order to establish a separate
sovereign entity.

The tendency to fragmentation becomes relevant most notably: a) when
effective control is established on part of a sovereign state on behalf
of a secessionist community, with the aim of fostering international
recognition of the new polity; and b) when separatist politics -- with
differing degrees of legitimacy and success -- are pursued within the
territory of a sovereign state in order to achieve political goals,
including the chance of seceding from the state. (1) To the first
category belong those independent territorial entities -- so-called de
facto states (2) --- which rely on the 'principle of effectiveness' to
support their claim to sovereign statehood. (3) Especially when
patronized (more or less officially) by external actors -- and
especially by Great Powers (4) --de facto states pose a dramatic
challenge to the international system, since they operate in a grey area
of international relations and international law. To the second category
belong a great variety of territorially organized sub-state entities
(federal/confederal entities, autonomous regions, etc.) and non-state
actors (stateless nations, indigenous peoples, national and ethnic
minorities) which -- in different capacities and on various grounds --
actively seek to increase their sovereign powers to possibly attain
title over the territory they occupy, most commonly by appealing to the
right of self-determination.

While it seems inappropriate to establish a causal relation between
secessionism/separatism and armed conflict or the outbreak of ethnic
violence, (5) as of 2009 [secessionism and
[separatism]{.mark}]{.underline} considered [together [constitute the
second most frequent source of conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} (6) In
plenty of cases [[secessionism is connected to]{.mark} practices
of]{.underline} both terror and [[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark},
respectively, [on behalf of [states]{.mark} --whose
institutions]{.underline} tend to [[dispose of]{.mark} disproportionate
[military means to crush insurgents -- and]{.mark} [non-state]{.mark}
groups --whose unscrupulous [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[resort
to terrorism]{.mark} as an opportunistic strategy [to escalate and
internationalize conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}. (7) Furthermore, since
the creation and maintenance of states is always cemented through
specific nation-building policies, [[secessionist]{.mark}/separatist
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[arise along dangerous]{.mark}
ethno-nationalist [fault lines and perpetuate]{.mark} ethno-political
[confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, the salience of the trend
to fragmentation is confirmed not merely by the progressive enlargement
of the society of states, but rather by the fact that -- in spite of
such enlargement -- the number of secessionist movements has at the same
time remained practically constant. (8) These indications suggest that
separatism -- and secessionist politics in particular -- is one of the
most serious challenges to both state institutions and the international
order as a whole: in fact, secessionist projects are pursued worldwide,
under both democratic and non-democratic regimes, by both violent and
non-violent means.

#### Causes nationalist backlash, global spillover, and civil wars that escalate and go nuclear

International Security Consequences of Self-Determination

Cases of [[self-determination]{.mark} have implications for
international security]{.underline}. There are four categories of
consequences that can trigger international intervention:

1\. [Conflict in a strategically important country]{.underline}: There
is a justified concern that the [demands for
self-determination]{.underline} in the Russian Federation and Ukraine
[[will bring about]{.underline}]{.mark} either [[a nationalist]{.mark},
antidemocratic [backlash or]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[collapse of state
institutions followed by]{.mark} the [outbreak of]{.mark} many [civil
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. The problem is compounded by the fact that
[Russia and Ukraine have [nuclear weapons]{.mark} that]{.underline}, if
either scenario materializes, [[will constitute a major]{.mark} security
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are limits, however, to what the
international community can do to avoid the breakup of the Russian
Federation, Ukraine, China, or India, all nuclear powers and all, to
varying degrees, vulnerable to being reshaped by the forces of ethnic
self-determination.

2\. Escalation of conflicts into regional wars: [Self-determination
[conflicts can escalate]{.mark} into regional wars b[y drawing
into]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark} the [regional powers]{.mark}. The
Somali-Ethiopian war]{.underline} over the Ogaden region [is such a
case]{.underline}. In the Western [Sahara, Morocco and Algeria fought a
war by proxy]{.underline}, with Algeria backing the Polisario.
Throughout the last few years, the war between the Burmese government
and the Karen rebels has escalated into the occasional confrontation
between the Thai and the Burmese military. There is a fear that [Serb
actions in]{.underline} the province of [Kosovo could draw Albania into
a war with Serbia, or]{.underline} that the Armenian-Azeri conflict over
the [Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline} enclave\'s right to
self-determination [could drag Turkey, Russia, or Iran into the
conflict]{.underline}. This fear is often overstated, especially by
those parties hoping to garner international support for their cause.
Regional powers are much more reluctant to intervene in civil wars, even
if they have domestic political reasons to do so. Even in the case of
intervention, regional powers often limit their ambitions and cooperate
tacitly to avoid a regional conflict.47

3\. The spread of conflicts: [Self-determination [claims spread through
the \"demonstration effect.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} If one group succeeds
in establishing its claim to the right of self-determination by force
against a central government, [others will be encouraged]{.underline}.
The Abkhaz and Ossetian separatism in Georgia, the Russian and Gagauz
separatism in Moldova, and the separatism in the North Caucasus region
of the Russian Federation have all fueled each other Self-determination
claims can also spread by \"contagion.\" [Militias infiltrate the
borders of neighboring countries, stockpile weapons, and set up bases
from which to launch cross-border attacks,]{.underline} often with the
consent of the host government. This introduces an element of insecurity
and anarchy in an area that hitherto had been at peace. C[ontagion
brought the war from Sri Lanka to]{.underline} the state of Tamil Nadu
in [India, and from Burma to Bangladesh]{.underline}. It could also
bring the Balkan conflict to Macedonia and pit ethnic Albanians against
ethnic Macedonians.

4\. Spillover of conflicts: [[Conflicts can spill over borders if they
cause]{.mark}, as they often do, [massive population movements]{.mark}.
The fighting between]{.underline} the Iraqi [government and the Iraqi
Kurds spilled over into Turkey]{.underline}; the fighting between
Rohyingas and the Burmese military has caused the movement of more than
two hundred thousand refugees into Bangladesh; the fighting in Sudan led
to refugees flowing into Ethiopia. In some cases (such as the
India-Pakistan war of 1971 and the Iraqi-Kurdish war of 1991) the UN
Security Council deemed the situation a threat to international peace
and security and, on that basis, intervened.

The wave of [[self-determination conflicts
threatens]{.underline}]{.mark} both the international order and
[[international peace]{.underline}]{.mark}. The clash between
self-determination and state sovereignty cannot be ignored much longer,
nor can the various conflicts born from it be treated with the same old
medicine: supporting the state\'s war-making capabilities to ensure its
victory over those claiming the right to self-determination.

[Illicit economies]{.underline} are not harmless and can [have
tremendous]{.underline} human, economic, societal and [security
costs]{.underline} and consequences.

[Illicit economies come with [vulnerabilities]{.mark} to]{.underline}
peace and [security]{.underline} --- [[includ]{.mark}ing
[corruption]{.mark}]{.underline}, violence, chaos, [organized crime,
[terror]{.mark}ist [financing and instability]{.mark}. Illicit
[economies are]{.mark} the lifeblood of]{.underline} today's bad actors,
[[enabling kleptocrats]{.mark} to]{.underline} loot their countries,
criminal organizations to co-opt states and [export violence and
terrorist groups [to finance]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} against our societies.

[[Illicit economies]{.mark} are pervasive threats that [undermine
democracy]{.mark}, corrode [the rule of law]{.mark}]{.underline}, fuel
impunity, [imperil]{.underline} effective [implementation of national
[sustainability and]{.mark} economic development]{.underline}
strategies, contribute to human rights abuses [and [enflame]{.mark}
violent [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Across today's global threat environment, criminals and bad actors
exploit natural disasters, human misery and market shocks for illicit
enrichment.

The lucrative criminal activities enabling and fueling the
multitrillion-dollar illicit economies include the smuggling and
trafficking of narcotics, opioids, weapons, humans, counterfeit and
pirated goods; illegal tobacco and alcohol products; illegally harvested
timber, wildlife and fish; pillaged oil, diamonds, gold, natural
resources and precious minerals; and other contraband commodities. Such
contraband and illicit goods are sold on our main streets, on social
media, in online marketplaces and on the dark web every minute of every
day. The United Nations has estimated that the dirty money laundered
annually from such criminal activities constitutes up to 5 percent of
global gross domestic product, or \$4 trillion.

The International Coalition Against Illicit Economies recognizes that
[[illicit economies]{.underline}]{.mark} and crime convergence
[[are]{.mark} threat [multipliers that ripple across]{.mark} borders and
imperil supply chain security]{.underline}, market integrity, democratic
freedoms [and institutions]{.underline} and systems of open, free and
just societies.

In Mexico and Central America, for example, organized crime infiltrated
the government at every level, and has diversified into other sectors
such as agriculture, mining and transportation. Criminals also control
strategic and critical infrastructure such as the country's major ports.
In recent years, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel has killed judges,
police officers, politicians and thousands of civilians. Gangs like
MS-13 and the Mexican cartels also remain a significant threat across
the United States.

[The]{.underline} significant [market penetration of the Latin
cartels]{.underline} has [resulted in illicit economies
that]{.underline} have [corrupted and destabilized
[Mexico]{.mark}'s]{.underline} justice system and [rule of law, and
threaten regional stability. Their reach is now global, expanding
to]{.underline} other [regions]{.underline} of the world [like [Africa,
Europe, and]{.mark} the [Asia]{.mark}-Pacific]{.underline}.

China's involvement in the expansion of illicit economies --- including
the booming trade in fraudulent consumer goods, money
laundering/trade-based money laundering and the corruptive and malign
influence of the Chinese Communist Party --- continues to harm American
national interests, our economy and competitiveness and the health and
safety of our citizens.

[In Africa]{.underline}, authoritarian governments,
[ungoverned]{.underline} spaces and [conflicts]{.underline} have
[created the perfect storm for criminals and terrorist groups to
expand]{.underline} their [illicit]{.underline} trafficking and
smuggling [operations. The]{.underline} lucrative business of [illicit
trade has]{.underline} also [been militarized]{.underline} in some
areas, bribing complicit government officials to shield illicit
enterprises from scrutiny and coercing soldiers to protect the illicit
markets.

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} other parts of the world -- from
[[South]{.mark}east [Asia to the Caucasus]{.mark}]{.underline} --
ruthless corrupt leaders and [malign [actors are]{.mark}]{.underline}
similarly [engaging in criminality and [undermining]{.mark} global
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}, financing criminalized markets and
[creating illicit economies]{.underline}.

According to Euromonitor, while COVID-19 has brought economic malaise to
most sectors, [the illicit economy continues to accelerate]{.underline},
especially across the digital world. E-commerce platforms and online
marketplaces are generating tremendous prosperity for scammers,
fraudsters, counterfeiters and other predatory criminals that are raking
in tens of billions of dollars selling fake pharmaceuticals and
vaccines, personal protective equipment, counterfeit apparel and
footwear, copyrighted electronics knock-offs and other illicit goods.
Recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates
put sales of fake goods and pirated products globally at \$464 billion
per year, with the International Trademark Association projecting that
such illicit trade could reach [up to \$2.3 trillion by
2022]{.underline}.

These [illicit [economies divert]{.mark} revenue [from]{.mark}
legitimate market drivers such as businesses]{.underline} and
governments and impair the ability of communities to make the
investments [necessary to stimulate economic
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially during these hard economic
times. [Revenue]{.underline} that [could be used to]{.underline} build
roads to facilitate commerce, hospitals to [fight [pandemic]{.mark}
outbreak[s and diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}, homes to raise and protect
families or schools to educate children and future leaders, is instead
lost to criminals' greed crimes.

But this goes beyond just economic harm. [Illicit economies]{.underline}
incur a significant negative social cost, and in some cases, help to
foment market instability, enslave our human capital, pillage our
natural world and [endanger national efforts to implement sustainable
development goals]{.underline}.

[Given the scale]{.underline}, Congress and the [Biden]{.underline}
administration [need to elevate the fight against illicit economies by
empowering]{.underline} our law enforcement [agencies with new legal
authorities and]{.underline} the necessary [resources to]{.underline}
disrupt illicit markets and anonymized criminal communications,
[prosecute]{.underline} illicit actors and threat networks, combat
corruption and [money-laundering safe havens]{.underline} and elevate
the issue as a national security and foreign policy priority.

The Declining Importance of the OSCE

The course of discussion conducted in the years 1995--1999 on the
subject of the future model of security for Europe corresponded to the
divisions existing within the OSCE. They reflected the divergent
interests of the participating states. In this debate, the [Western and
Central European countries were on the side of the proponents of a
multi-level 'architecture']{.underline} for the European security
system, [in which]{.underline} the [OSCE]{.underline} [would receive
the]{.underline} [broadest role]{.underline} but would not be based on
obligations of a legal nature. [It would have a structure
promoting]{.underline} democratic [values]{.underline} [and
adopting]{.underline} so-called [soft security guarantees. They saw the
main guarantees of security as laying in NATO, which had
expanded]{.underline} to the [east]{.underline} in 1999, and to a lesser
degree, the European Security and Defense Policy, which had been
proclaimed at the time by the European Union. [There was a return to the
realist paradigm, which was made easier by]{.underline} the
[misunderstandings with Russia]{.underline} [on account of its criticism
of NATO's interventions in]{.underline} the Federal Republic of
[Yugoslavia]{.underline} (the 'Kosovo War'). In the West and in the new
NATO member countries of Central Europe, [the conviction grew that
'hard' guarantees]{.underline} of security [should be pursued and the
engagement of the USA]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the question of
[European security]{.underline} [should be deepened]{.underline}. This
conviction was [made]{.underline} the [stronger]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} the replacements and supplementation of weaponry by
[NATO]{.underline}'s new member states, and by the growing
interoperativeness of their armies due to their involvement in US and
NATO military adventures (in Afghanistan and Iraq, and Afghanistan
respectively). Furthermore, politicians in the new, Central European
members of NATO considered that they should behave as the US wished,
while activeness within the OSCE would not bring benefits, particularly
as Russia supported the organization. Feeling their own strength, NATO
and EU countries did not appreciate the need to make use of the OSCE's
unique and peace-building instruments. They also did not sufficiently
appreciate that the OSCE is the broadest and most democratic forum in
the Euro-Atlantic area. The reason for the OSCE's weakening can be seen
in the doubling of its functions by the Council of Europe, the EU, and
to a lesser degree, the Community of Democracies founded in Warsaw in
2000.

In the first decade of the 21st century, the West attempted to use the
OSCE to promote democracy in the eastern part of Europe. The USA and the
EU, including Poland, tried to involve the organization in supporting
the so-called color revolutions. In Poland, the policy of exporting
democracy in this manner was conducted especially actively by the
nationalist right in the years 2005--2007 by PiS governments and by the
president, Lech Kaczyński. Attempts were made to use the Warsaw Office
of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights to this end, but the OSCE as
a whole did not allow for such a policy of promoting democracy. Thus for
the Western countries the OSCE turned out to be practically useless. In
an exposé by the Polish minister of foreign affairs, Stefan Meller, in
the Sejm on February 15, 2006 the OSCE was not even mentioned
individually by name.

On the other hand, when the new head of Polish diplomacy, Anna Fotyga,
appeared in the Sejm in the following year, she recognized the OSCE and
ODHIR as the basic plane for Poland's regional activities. She claimed
that Poland supports the ODIHR in its activities, appreciating above all
the role and importance the ODIHR in the regional dimension. She stated:

> Poland supports the ODIHR in its actions, appreciating above all the
> role and importance of the ODIHR for the democratic processes taking
> place in the world. Poles have participated in many election
> observation missions and we know how important such measures are. We
> want the ODIHR to be able to maintain its independent role and its
> current framework of action. We are afraid that political factors
> could limit what to this time has constituted the ODIHR's great value
> that is, being guided above all by democratic principles. Poland
> supports the ODIHR. The Polish authorities attach great significance
> to the human dimension of their security policy, to supporting
> democratic processes and values and respecting human rights.Footnote11

In Poland's National Security Strategy of 2007 it is stated that "Poland
shall continue to be involved in the work of the Organization for
Security and Co-operation in Europe",Footnote12 as in the Council of
Europe, the OECD, and other multilateral institutions.

After the Istanbul summit in November 1999, the OSCE was marginalized by
the policies of the Western and Central European countries. Its organs
functioned but the next summit took place only in December 2010 in
Kazakhstan (in Astana). The choice of location for these summits proved
the departure from democratic standards as neither the Turks nor the
Kazakhs respect human rights in their domestic legislation and policies.

Russia contributed to a certain revival of the OSCE when it announced,
in June 2008, the 'Medvedev Plan' for rebuilding the architecture of
European security and concluding European Security Treaty
(EST).Footnote13 However, the suspension in December 2007 of the
implementation of the CFE Treaty by Russia, followed in August 2008 by
the Georgian War and Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and Southern
Ossetia in response to the recognition of the independence of Kosovo by
western countries were all factors which complicated relations between
the West and Russia. Later, in an attempt to reduce tensions between the
two sides, a dialogue was conducted within the framework of the 'Corfu
Process' at the OSCE headquarters in Vienna,Footnote14 inaugurated at an
informal meeting of ministers of foreign affairs on the Greek island of
Corfu on June 27--28, 2009. The majority of the OSCE member countries
viewed the Russian initiative unfavorably. According to Angela Stent:

> The Western response ranged from lukewarm to hostile. From the U.S.
> point of view there was no need for another legally binding
> Euro-Atlantic super-treaty. The OSCE had already taken care of that.
> Several clauses in the proposed Medvedev treaty particularly worried
> NATO because they implied that NATO's commitment to collective defense
> should be superseded by an all-European commitment to collective
> defense.Footnote15

In these circumstances it was agreed to forward the Russian proposal to
the OSCE. However, it should be noted that, already then, while Russia
supported the OSCE as a multilateral mechanism, it didn't accord much
importance to this organization. According to Elena Kropatcheva:

> \[I\]f in the early 1990s Russia used the OSCE in high profile
> politics, today Russia tends to use the OSCE more in 'low politics'.
> The 'low politics' issues have become more important for regional
> European security and stability. This is why, the OSCE format remains
> important for Russia on the issues of transnational threats rather
> than as a forum for discussing its EST initiative. The OSCE is still
> used to promote Russia's role as a great power, and, if it were
> reformed, Russia could use the Organization more in this
> sense.Footnote16

As part of the 'Corfu Process' dialogue, it was agreed that the OSCE
should be strengthened in regard to preventing and resolving crises by,
among other things, the necessary modification of its existing
mechanisms (and where necessary the formation of new ones) and
maintenance of the Organization's role as a consultation forum in
matters of Euro-Atlantic security.

Attempts to Revive the OSCE

The 'Corfu Process' did not lead to any significant progress, however,
and the leaders of the OSCE member states who came together in Astana on
December 1--2, 2010 after an 11-year hiatus stated only that "\[t\]he
time has now come to act, and we must define concrete and tangible goals
in addressing \[...\] challenges. We are determined to work together to
fully realize the vision of a comprehensive, co-operative and
indivisible security community throughout our shared OSCE
area".Footnote17 This was a proposal for talks aimed at creating a
'security community' within the OSCE area, based on an idea proposed
over half a century earlier by Karl Deutsch.Footnote18

This meeting gave rise to considerable expectations, particularly in the
countries of Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, which was chairing the
Organization. Seventy-three official delegations of member countries and
OSCE partners took part in the summit, as did representatives of the
leading international and regional organizations: the secretary general
of the UN, Ban Ki-Moon; the head of the European Council, Herman van
Rompuy; the heads of the Islamic Conference Organization, CIS, the
Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic
Community, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and other
organizations. However, many member states---including Poland and the
USA---were not represented in Astana by their heads of states but rather
by their ministers of foreign affairs.

The representatives gathered at the summit indicated that on the
East-West axis it was a question of cooperation between the EU and NATO
on one hand and the Eurasian Economic Community and the Collective
Security Treaty Organization on the other. In this manner the
transatlantic integration constructed in the previous century could be,
in a natural manner, supplemented by trans-Eurasian integration. In
Astana, a difficult stage in the history of the OSCE was concluded and
many speakers called for its revival in new conditions, in the 'spirit
of Helsinki'. The president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev,
proposed to work out a comprehensive Treaty on Security in Eurasia. The
participants stressed in their speeches that respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms should be the foundation for lasting security
in the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian areas. In connection with this,
Kazakhstan proposed that religious tolerance should be made one of the
OSCE's dimensions, and also offered a range of initiatives to increase
the number of OSCE baskets and institutions, for instance, to place
economic and financial security in the 'second basket' of the OSCE, to
create an OSCE Ecology Forum, and to open an OSCE Security Institute in
Astana.Footnote19

Subsequently, France, Germany, Russia, and Poland joined the Initiative
for the Development of a Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian Security
Community---IDEAS, in connection with the idea of community security
adopted in the OSCE Astana Summit Declaration. In December 2011, at a
session in Vilnius, the OSCE Ministerial Council supported the joint
project presented by the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Poland,
and Russia. In the following year, expert institutions from these four
countriesFootnote20 organized a series of four seminars (in Berlin,
Warsaw, Paris, and Moscow) on the subject "Towards a Euro-Atlantic and
Eurasian Security Community". The result was the joint document Towards
a Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian Security Community: From Vision to Reality.
It was presented by four institutes at an informal meeting of the
ambassadors of the OSCE member countries on October 23, 2012 in Vienna.

This report, which was addressed to all the countries belonging to the
OSCE, contains the following proposals for common activities to lead to
the creation of a security community from Vancouver to Vladivostok:

> reinforcing the arms control system and confidence-building measures;
>
> common responsibility for resolving conflicts within the OSCE area;
>
> cooperation to increase the stability and security of Central Asia and
> Afghanistan;
>
> measures taken to reconcile countries and societies;
>
> closer cooperation to address transnational threats and challenges;
>
> joint action on behalf of sustained economic development;
>
> reinforcing the effectiveness of the OSCE's 'human dimension';
>
> dialogue with Muslim communities within the OSCE;
>
> creating a network of academic institutions supporting the OSCE's
> activities.

The document, drawn-up by analysts from four countries, provides a new
look at the challenges involved in strengthening Euro-Atlantic and
Eurasian security. It favors connecting the entire area of the OSCE into
one whole. This is the opinion not of governments but uniquely of
experts. However, the report was not heeded. The Western countries were
unwilling to strengthen the OSCE and in autumn of 2013, after the
outbreak of the crisis in Ukraine, relations with Russia significantly
worsened and dialogue on the subject of building a security community
was suspended.

[The]{.underline} [US]{.underline} [has a very critical
approach]{.underline} [to the OSCE and places the entire responsibility
for]{.underline} the [crisis]{.underline} [in the organization on
Russia]{.underline}, for violating the organization's principles. [The
US opposes]{.underline} the structural changes proposed by Moscow, as
well as the idea of [giving the OSCE a legal personality]{.underline}
and multi-year budget.Footnote21 The American position is supported by
the majority of NATO and EU members. [This means that the West has
abandoned]{.underline} [the idea of a comprehensive]{.underline} and
[integrated approach to security]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
[combines hard and soft aspects]{.underline} [and is built by political
dialogue]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the [equal participation of all
57 member countries of the OSCE]{.underline}.

[The Western countries]{.underline} [deliberately ceased to treat the
OSCE]{.underline} [as a necessary institution for closer cooperation and
greater security]{.underline} in the Euro-Atlantic area. [Such a
political choice]{.underline} is a departure from the path taken in the
recent past, even in the first years after the Cold War. It also
[signifies the relinquishment]{.underline} [of a comprehensive approach
to shaping international security, with consideration for so-called soft
aspects of security]{.underline}. But [this choice cannot
be]{.underline} seen as a [reasonable]{.underline} one [given the
continual appearance of new challenges]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[security threats]{.underline} [of a non-traditional and non-military
nature. If we look at]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline} crisis, [it
has to be stated that the OSCE is the sole organization that is acting
toward its resolution. With some reservations, the OSCE is accepted by
both sides]{.underline} to the conflict [and has participated in working
out and supervising the Minsk peace agreements]{.underline} (of
September 5, 2014 and February 12, 2015).Footnote22 [Even the US has
shown]{.underline} some [interest in the role the OSCE has
played]{.underline} in the Ukraine crisis.Footnote23

In spite of the generally limited interest shown by Western countries in
reviving the OSCE and strengthening its role as a security institution,
on the initiative of the 2014 Swiss OSCE Chairmanship in close
co-operation with Serbia and Germany at the OSCE Ministerial Council
2014 in Basel on December 4 was launched the Panel of Eminent Persons on
European Security as a Common Project. It was composed of 15 eminent
personalities with long-standing practical expertise in European
security in all its dimensions from all OSCE regions, and mandated to
provide advice on how to reconsolidate peace and security in the OSCE
area on the grounds of the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris.
This body prepared the basis for an inclusive and constructive security
dialogue across the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian regions, reflecting on
how to re-build trust among OSCE participating states, and examining
perceived threats in the OSCE area and potential common solutions. The
Panel has produced two reports: an Interim Report on lessons learned for
the OSCE from its engagement in Ukraine (June 2015), and a Final Report
on the broader issues of security in Europe and the OSCE area at large
(November 2015).

The Final report consists in presentation of different views of the
West, Russia and states in between, evaluates the current crisis in
European security and its dangers, and formulates recommendations to set
in motion a robust political and diplomatic process to overcome the
present crisis. It recommends how to avoid military accidents or
incidents (inter alia to reactivate of the NATO-Russia Council), and a
new start for Ukraine by complete the implementation of the Minsk
agreements. The Report appealed for organizing the next Summit Meeting
of the OSCE and to undertake by next Chairmanships, starting with
Germany in 2016, to continue the consultations on reinvigorating
security in the OSCE area.Footnote24

The OSCE Ministerial Council, meeting on December 8--9, 2016 in Hamburg,
agreed to continue supporting the work of the OSCE and to use the
Organization as a platform for dialogue and to continue addressing
migration-related issues where the OSCE has expertise, with the aim of
developing effective measures and common approaches to this challenge.
It also decided to increase its efforts to prevent and combat terrorism.
These decisions have more political than practical significance, but
they are important because Europe, and particularly the EU, is unable to
deal with either the migration crisis begun in 2014 or with terrorism.
Ministers also initiated a Structured Dialogue on the current and future
challenges and risks to security in the OSCE area. The subsequent OCSE
Ministerial Council in Vienna on December 7--8, 2017 concentrated on
filling key posts within the organs of the organization, on the
continuation of the Structured Dialogue, but failed to make any
significant decisions strengthening the OCSE.

[Real conditions in the Euro-Atlantic area should definitely incline
countries to favor broad solutions]{.underline} [based on international
dialogue, and the OSCE is the]{.underline} [broadest existing
international security institution]{.underline}, [bringing]{.underline}
[together]{.underline} [at]{.underline} [one table]{.underline} [57
countries]{.underline} [from the entire area between Vancouver and
Vladivostok. It is worth remembering that the OSCE is one of the oldest
organizations promoting democratic norms and values]{.underline}, [and
that this is important in the current situation where other
organizations of Euro-Atlantic security are weakening]{.underline}. [The
OSCE could thus turn out to be useful as a modern 'embedded security
organization']{.underline}.Footnote25 Taking all the above into
consideration, it is worthwhile to paraphrase an idea from the book of a
well-known American political scientist, Charles Kupchan, who claims
that [we should all, in the Euro-Atlantic area, learn how to make
friends of our enemies]{.underline} [and build a lasting
peace]{.underline}.Footnote26 [The OSCE]{.underline} still [has the
opportunity to create such a community of security.]{.underline}

The flurry of [diplomatic meetings dedicated to]{.underline} [Moscow's
demands]{.underline} [for a]{.underline} [new security paradigm in
Europe]{.underline} will [culminate]{.underline} [with]{.underline}
discussions at [the]{.underline} Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe ([OSCE]{.underline}) on January 13. The scheduled
[talks in Vienna]{.underline} have [garnered]{.underline} [little
attention]{.underline} [in comparison to bilateral
U.S.-Russian]{.underline} [discussions]{.underline} on January 10 [and
the meeting of the]{.underline} [NATO-Russia Council]{.underline} on
January 12. In truth, [few concrete outcomes]{.underline} [are likely to
result from the final round of discussions]{.underline}, which will take
place during a regular session of the OSCE's Permanent Council.
[The]{.underline} [scope of Russia's demands]{.underline} and the
fundamental questions they pose [are]{.underline} far [too
complex]{.underline} to be considered in a single meeting. [Nonetheless,
if Russia is willing to engage in diplomatic negotiations about the
future of European security]{.underline}---as opposed to insisting on
the West's immediate acceptance of its demands in their entirety---and
refrains from using them as a pretext for war, then [the]{.underline}
potential [role of the]{.underline} [OSCE]{.underline} [in
securing]{.underline} a [new peace in Europe]{.underline} [is
worth]{.underline} [close consideration]{.underline}.

[As a]{.underline} [forum for dialogue]{.underline}
[covering]{.underline} a broad range of regional [security
issues]{.underline} [with an]{.underline} [open membership policy, the
OSCE]{.underline} arguably [is the]{.underline} [most appropriate of the
aforementioned venues]{.underline} to consider Russia's maximalist
proposals. Yet the organization faces considerable constraints on its
ability to serve as a useful platform for dialogue. In this regard, a
look at the potential advantages and disadvantages of the OSCE in
facilitating a resolution to the crisis is helpful in devising
recommendations on how to improve its chances of success in breaking the
impasse.

Why the OSCE Is the Right Framework

In many ways, [the OSCE is]{.underline} the [ideal]{.underline}
framework in which to consider Russia's security demands as well as the
reciprocal views of other countries. First and foremost,
[the]{.underline} OSCE's [membership]{.underline} [structure
ensures]{.underline} that [all countries]{.underline} [with a stake in
European security are included]{.underline} in the discussion. [The OSCE
was created as a forum for dialogue between the East and West during the
Cold War]{.underline}. [By]{.underline} [design]{.underline}, [it has an
inclusive membership policy]{.underline} and comprises 57 participating
states spanning from Vancouver to Vladivostok. [There are no
prerequisites]{.underline} [for membership]{.underline} other than
geography. [The organization operates according to a consensus-based
decisionmaking model]{.underline}, [ensuring]{.underline} that [less
powerful]{.underline} [states]{.underline} in Europe [have]{.underline}
just [as much]{.underline} of an [opportunity]{.underline} to engage in
and shape discussions on security issues as their more powerful
neighbors. In the context of Russia's buildup of military forces along
Ukraine's border and its insistence on carving out a sphere of influence
in the post-Soviet region, [discussions at the OSCE allow the Biden
administration to follow through on its pledge]{.underline} [not to
conclude security agreements with Russia]{.underline} [over the
heads]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the [countries]{.underline} that
would be [most affected]{.underline} by them. Of the many discussions
scheduled for mid-January, this is the only one in which Ukraine has a
chance to respond directly to Russia's demands and to do so on an equal
footing.

Second, Russia's proposals take aim at core concepts of regional
security that emerged from the OSCE. The OSCE traces its origins to the
Helsinki Final Act of 1975, in which contemporary European states
unanimously pledged to uphold 10 principles guiding relations between
them. These principles, which became known as the Decalogue, include
sovereign equality and respect for rights inherent in sovereignty;
refraining from the threat or use of force; and the peaceful settlement
of disputes. These are precisely the issues that Russia has brought up
for debate with its recent proposals for NATO and the United States. If
Russia wishes to engage in earnest talks on revising the foundations of
European security, then the OSCE---as the forum in which Russia
initially agreed to adhere to these principles---is the right venue for
this discussion. Russia affirmed its commitment to upholding basic
standards of behavior outlined in the Helsinki Final Act and the 1990
Charter of Paris for a New Europe, which adapted the concept of
comprehensive security to the post-Communist era, when it signed the
1999 Charter for European Security. It pledged to implement these
documents fully and in good faith at the 2010 Astana Summit, which was
the most recent high-level summit organized under the auspices of the
OSCE. Clearly, there is a need to work though the discrepancies between
what Russia agreed to and its recent actions.

Finally, [the OSCE has experience]{.underline} [supporting negotiations
on confidence-building measures that could allay Russia's stated
concerns]{.underline}. [Underpinning]{.underline} [Russia's demands
for]{.underline} a cordon sanitaire in the post-Soviet space and
[a]{.underline} [restriction on NATO]{.underline} enlargement and its
activities in non-member states [is a narrative that portrays Russia
as]{.underline} a [besieged]{.underline} fortress that is surrounded on
all sides by enemies. [This]{.underline} belief among the top echelons
of the Kremlin [has]{.underline} [metastasized]{.underline}
[after]{.underline} five [waves of NATO enlargement]{.underline}. It is
still unclear whether Russia will accept anything short of its demand
for a buffer zone in Eastern Europe, but a shift in focus toward
mitigating specific capabilities and behaviors that provoke concern in
Moscow would put the OSCE in a position to affect a positive outcome.
Having hosted talks that led to the adoption of Conventional Forces in
Europe (CFE) and Open Skies Treaties at the end of the Cold War, and as
the organization in charge of the Vienna Document, [the OSCE has
sufficient experience and technical capacity to lead dialogues on
reducing tensions through transparency, improved
communication]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [reciprocal
limitations]{.underline}. More recently, limited [progress]{.underline}
[has been made in the OSCE's Structured Dialogue on the topic of risk
reduction]{.underline}, and [this format could be used as a
springboard]{.underline} [for]{.underline} additional
[confidence-building measures]{.underline} [to rebuild the basic trust
that is a prerequisite to talks at the strategic level]{.underline}.

#### OSCE's the [only]{.underline} viable peace medium after the invasion. 

Teoman Ertuğrul **Tulun 22**, Analyst at the Avrasya Incelemeleri
Merkezi Center for Eurasian Studies, "NATO Is Not Brain-Dead: How Can
OSCE and NATO Help Stop the War in Ukraine?," AVIM, March 2022

[In an interview]{.underline} about two and a half years ago, French
President Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} arrogantly [claimed]{.underline}
that [NATO was brain dead]{.underline} and Europe was on the edge of the
precipice, [and]{.underline} he assertively [questioned]{.underline}
[NATO\'s]{.underline} [very future]{.underline}.\[1\] Corresponding to
the same period, [he also mentioned his long-time dream of developing a
European military force]{.underline}.\[2\] This European military force
is, in fact, the hypothetical joint Franco-German European army that
France and Germany announced during the signing of a new \"Treaty on
Franco-German Cooperation and Integration\" in Aachen on January 22,
2019.\[3\]

A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since 2019. The intervention,
which [Russia]{.underline} [initiated]{.underline} under [a]{.underline}
\"special military operation\" towards Ukraine and which turned into a
[full-fledged war]{.underline} in fifteen days, has revealed how empty
are the words Macron made for NATO two and a half years ago. The elapsed
time has also proved that Macrons rhetoric about establishing a European
Army is only wishful thinking. [The war in Ukraine has caused grave
concern]{.underline} in the Nordic countries. Certain EU member Nordic
countries, which are very keen to preach lessons and to show the right
way like teachers to non-EU European countries (including Turkey) on
many subjects at every opportunity, this time began to see themselves in
an imminent security threat. For example, according to a Deutsche Welle
(DW) report, Sweden and Finland, who had stayed out of NATO due to their
military nonalignment policy supported in the past by majorities of both
Finns and Swedes, now seem to change their policy due to war in
Ukraine.\[4\] As per the DW report, the shift in opinion is especially
dramatic in Finland, and for the first time in its history, a majority
of Finns are in favor of joining NATO. In this context., it is reported
that nowadays, 53% Finnish population is in favor of joining NATO. It is
stated that this rate was 19% in 2017. DW report also points to the
development that the approval rate of NATO membership in Sweden rose to
41% in 2022 from 32% in 2017. These developments indicate that NATO,
contrary to Macron\'s claims, is not in danger of brain death and is
instead seen as the most reliable defence organization for some EU
member states with the highest welfare level. It seems possible that the
EU will become much more in need of the NATO security umbrella in the
coming period. These developments show us that [security is provided not
with rhetoric]{.underline} [but with reliable]{.underline} and powerful
[defence]{.underline} forces.

[On the other hand]{.underline}, these days, [when]{.underline} a
[serious war]{.underline} situation [is taking place]{.underline} right
next to Turkey, it is believed that [it would be beneficial to go back
to the past]{.underline} [and]{.underline} to [remember the principle of
\"indivisibility of security\" developed by the]{.underline}
Conference/Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(CSCE/[OSCE]{.underline}) [and]{.underline} to [explain the essence of
this principle to the younger generations]{.underline}. In the 1975
Helsinki Final Act of the CSCE, the participating States recognized the
indivisibility of security in Europe. In this respect, the fifth
introductory paragraph of the Act states that [Recognizing the
indivisibility]{.underline} [of security in Europe as well as their
common interest in the development of cooperation throughout
Europe]{.underline} and among selves and expressing their intention to
pursue efforts accordingly.\[5\] By indivisible security it was
[meant]{.underline} that [the security of each state]{.underline} of
CSCE region [is]{.underline} [inextricably linked]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} the security of [every other state]{.underline}.
Another way of putting this would be: [Cooperation]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [beneficial to all]{.underline} participating States,
while the insecurity in or of one participating State can affect the
well-being of all.\[6\] Furthermore, the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New
Europe declared that security is indivisible and the security of every
participating State is inseparably linked to that of all the
others.\[7\]

[In the context of]{.underline} CSCE/[OSCE]{.underline}, [the most
evolved form of]{.underline} studies and [negotiations]{.underline} on
developing security and cooperation in Europe [was reached]{.underline}
in Istanbul at the dawn of the 21st century. At the OSCE Istanbul summit
in November 1999, the leaders of fifty-four states participating in the
OSCE signed the Charter for European Security called the Istanbul
Document. Paragraph 8 of the Charter for European Security involves one
of the crucial principles for the security and stability of Europe in
the 21st century.\[8\] The paragraph (p.3) reads as follows:

> 8\. Each participating State has an equal right to security. We
> reaffirm the inherent right of each and every participating State to
> be free to choose or change its security arrangements, including
> treaties of alliance, as they evolve. Each State also has the right to
> neutrality. Each participating State will respect the rights of all
> others in these regards. They will not strengthen their security at
> the expense of the security of other States. [Within]{.underline} the
> [OSCE]{.underline}, [no]{.underline} State, group of
> [State]{.underline}s or organization [can have]{.underline} [any
> pre-eminent responsibility]{.underline} [for]{.underline} maintaining
> [peace]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [stability]{.underline} [in the
> OSCE area or can consider any part of the OSCE area as its sphere of
> influence]{.underline}.

[The reason for the war situation that Europe is facing in Ukraine today
is that Russia and some countries in the Western bloc consider this
paragraph in terms of their priorities. The parties cannot achieve
everything they want in the negotiations to ensure]{.underline}
security, stability, [peace]{.underline}, and cooperation among 54
countries. [If the outcome]{.underline} of the negotiation [is to
reflect]{.underline} a [consensus, the negotiating parties must strike a
reasonable balance]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [reflects their
priorities]{.underline} as much as possible. Paragraph 8 of the
above-mentioned Charter reflects such a balance. In order [to find a
solution to the war situation]{.underline} we face today in Ukraine, the
[constructive negotiation spirit]{.underline} of the period when the
1999 Istanbul Document was prepared [must be returned]{.underline}. In
our judgment, Turkey, in current circumstances, is one of
[the]{.underline} most appropriate [OSCE]{.underline} countries that
[can]{.underline} [best prepare the suitable ground for a revival of
such constructive spirit in the new negotiations]{.underline}.

## NATO Bad NB

### Avoids NATO Bad\-\--2NC

#### The OSCE can fully replace NATO's security role in Europe but avoids exacerbating security dilemmas. 

Ejaz **Hussain 22**, London-based analyst on South-Asian and
Middle-Eastern security, "Russia-Ukraine conflict: Can OSCE replace
NATO?," Global Village Space, 3-2-2022,
<https://www.globalvillagespace.com/russia-ukraine-conflict-can-osce-replace-nato/>

As predicted, Russia being one of UN's original P-5 members, used its
right of Veto against any probable UNSC Resolution aimed at punishing
Kremlin for launching a military operation against Ukraine.

China, another Veto power in UN, customarily stayed away from the US-led
club in the Security Council.

Britain, as all-time loyal American martinet in Europe, despite a
divorce from EU, was all out to obey the orders from Washington---but
such orders were never issued.

France, having learnt enough history lessons already---from the
Napoleonic misadventure against Russia (1812), the Crimean War
(1854-56), WW-1 (1914-18), WW-2 (1939-45) and the Cold War---pursued
'strategic' quietness at the 25 February UNSC meeting.

NATO spineless against Russia

[During his most recent meeting with]{.underline} Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline}, in Moscow, President [Macron]{.underline} [ensured
that France]{.underline} [may pursue benevolent neutrality]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} case the [Ukraine]{.underline} crisis turned into an
armed conflict.

[As a result of that, the]{.underline} 15-member [UNSC]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} once again [clearly divided]{.underline} [between
the]{.underline} [US-UK]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [one
side]{.underline} of the aisle [and]{.underline} [Russia-China on the
other]{.underline}. Hence [the]{.underline} whole [US plan for taking
a]{.underline} [UN-authorised/NATO-led military action against Russia,
ended in]{.underline} an imminent [diplomatic opprobrium.
The]{.underline} [net outcome]{.underline} is---President Biden will
NEVER authorise Pentagon to attack Russia, moreover he will keep Jens
Stoltenberg at a shorter leash---[no]{.underline} unilateral [NATO
action]{.underline}, either!

What we will see rather sooner, the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy will
surrender unconditionally and Russian offensive to protect and defend
democracy in Donetsk, Donbas and Luhansk---will conclude in a few days.
This time it will go down in history a Russian moral 'victory with
honour', and a severe blow to the US, UK, and NATO hegemony over Europe
and other adjoining sub-regions. I would call it the end of the Monroe
Doctrine (1823) and gigantic frustration for the authors of CAATSA
(2017) and 517 US Congressmen who voted for it.

Sanctions, sanctions, sanctions!

Once again, as predicted, Biden and his trigger-crazy broncos couldn't
go beyond imposing sanctions on Putin---the business as usual. But this
time, instead of impacting on Putin's Russia these sanctions will hurt
the entire EU region---economically and politically. We shall see in
next 6-12 months a number of European factories shut, workers going
jobless, homes and workplaces facing blackouts, vehicles going off-road,
and eruption of social & political upheavals from Poland to Spain and
Finland to Italy. All major European political parties---Centre,
Centre-right, Centre-left, Right-wing, Far-right, the CDU, SD & the
Greens are not prepared to see again the Europe of Metternich,
Napoleon-III, Bismarck or Kaiser Wilhelm-II.

Already, the US imposed sanctions haven't brought desired results
vis-a-vis Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, North Korea, and China---and
they would prove disastrous for Europe at large---if they continued
against Russia over a long period of time.

Beginning of the end of Pax-Americana

Vladimir [Putin has robustly conveyed to]{.underline} Biden, Johnson,
and EU-[NATO]{.underline} leaders [that it's time they changed their
coercive approach]{.underline} towards the countries that disagree with
the American way of life.

It has taken the Russian leader two decades to rebuild his country that
lost its glory after crumbling of Soviet Union in 1990. He had to undo a
host of political, diplomatic, industrial and military actions taken by
Gorbachev and Yeltsin during 1990s. He was convinced that without
addressing the above four areas Russia couldn't achieve economic
progress and prosperity. Today---the top strategists and global security
pundits on both sides of the Atlantic are aware of the Russian military
prowess---conventional as well as nuclear.

They have started reading again Allison's ESSENCE OF DECISION, Cuban
Missile Crisis and how McGeorge Bundy, McNamara, and Dean Rusk pursued
'excessive' restraint to avert a nuclear Armageddon at their doorstep.
They were all aghast by the destructive scale of Igor Kurchatov's most
formidable nuclear force---'Tsar Bomba', the thermonuclear monster of
its time.

Russia's military capabilities

For the sake of records, Russia still has more than 6,400 nuclear
warheads---which is more than 45% of the world's entire 14,000 nuclear
bombs. President Putin, exactly four years ago---while giving his 'State
of the Nation' speech on 01 March 2018---unveiled Russia's NEW STRATEGIC
DOCTRINE.

He recalibrated Russia's nuclear outreach by declaring that, "Moscow
WILL use its nuclear weapons if threatened or bullied by its hostile
adversaries". This was a loud and clear counter-narrative to the US
Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.

As per the latest statistics of MILITARY BALANCE, Russia has four key
components of its upgraded/modernised nuclear arsenal:

i\) PC-28 CopMaT MIRV, super-mighty thermonuclear ICBM, to hit with
precision any target within the range of 10,000 miles---covering every
inch of North America and Australasia (QUAD/AUKUS/APEC inclusive).

ii\) Nuclear Super-Torpedo platform (Belgorod & Khabarovsk)---that with
its 100 megaton tip, can cause 500 metre high tsunami tide around any
coastal city in the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian as well as Arctic and
Atlantic.

All 18 US/NATO/allied aircraft carriers are within its forecourt reach.

iii\) AVANGARD---hypersonic nuclear glide vehicles with average speed of
7Km per second (20 times the speed of sound).

It can penetrate through any missile defence system on the planet.

iv\) BUREVESTNIK, nuclear-powered Cruise Missile (9M730)---it can
completely annihilate, within the range of 10,000 miles, any target the
size of New York City or London.

With such unimaginably frightful realities---the US will NEVER attack
Russia.

No more proxy wars

After the Ukrainian egregious blunder---US may NOT launch a proxy war
against Russia, either.

What I'm envisaging is---Biden has put himself between 'Scylla and
Charybdis'---A biting Russia on one side (Europe) and a hard-hitting
China on the other (Asia-Pacific).

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has failed to muster
enough support of its erstwhile allies that can fight in
Europe]{.underline}, alongside Pentagon---Germany, France and Italy will
not be on the US charabanc against Russia. Instead, President Biden, in
a few days, is likely to offer substantive concessions to
Iran---removing a number of economic sanctions. Also, he may also
announce alleviation of ongoing economic troubles in Afghanistan.

Britain with its scanty resources---ill equipped Army of 86,000
part-time troops, 33,000 innocuous sailors of Royal Navy and another
33,000 wing-clipped under-fed birds of Royal AF. With shelved Trident,
corroded ships/submarines, archeo-jets, and below-average political
leadership, on top, Britain wouldn't even fire an airgun pallet against
the Russian troops, to please its masters on the other side of the
Atlantic.

Hence, it amply suggests that [for the US and its over-ambitious allies
the possibility of pursuing the]{.underline} [second phase of the Cold
War]{.underline}---against China and Russia---[is]{.underline} [fast
diminishing]{.underline}. In other words---no more Taiwan, South Korea,
Japan, India and Down-under are in a position to stand by Americans
against China through the rubric of QUAD or AUKUS. Similarly, the
minnows like Ukraine, the Baltics, the Czech Republic, and even
Johnson's Britain will not militarily withstand Russia.

Golden decade of Russia, China and their allies

My argument stands tall and firm---[this decade]{.underline} (2021-2030)
[belongs to Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and Central
Asia]{.underline}. The Pakistani leadership MUST reconcile with emerging
regional security landscape.

The rusty/obsolete argument---if we offended the US and its GCC allies,
Pakistan will be deprived of \$30 billion remittances, annually---must
be revisited.

It's true that out of 10 million NRPs (Non-Resident Pakistanis), nearly
3 million are working for the arrogant Arab employers. Hypothetically,
if US gets angry with Pakistan , Arabs' Uber-masters in
Washington/London will pressure these employers to tighten screws on
Pakistan.

But the Holy Quran says---"There is not a single living thing on earth
whose sustenance is not guaranteed by Allah (SWT)". Why worry about
economic survival when we have the Greatest Provider with us?

All we have to do is---demonstrate 100% trust in Him. We should either
get rid of the grand economic fear or give up our divine faith.

We Pakistanis shouldn't be perturbed if oil-rich Arabs are in the
process of investing \$70 billion in Narendra Modi's India---the
Golgotha for 300 million Muslims? We shouldn't care more if Saudi top
military commander General Fahd bin Abdullah al-Mutair spends his 2022
Valentine Day with blood-sucking supremacist Indian premier Modi, or the
UAE regime builds Hindu temples in Abu Dhabi?

We must learn to live with the fact that all nations---Muslim and
non-Muslim have the right to pursue their national interests, as per
their vision. Let the Saudi-led Arab League conduct their diplomacy as
per their needs, desires and aspirations. They will eventually come back
to Pakistan---perhaps not by choice but for their desperate needs.
There's a famous ancient Chinese proverb---"when water rises, the fish
eats the ant; but when water recedes, the ant eats the fish".

Time for OSCE to assert itself

[It's]{.underline} [time for ageing NATO]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[retire---the septuagenarian Atlantic Treaty is]{.underline}
[exhausted]{.underline}, [fatigued]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[overworked. Instead, the]{.underline} Organisation of Security &
Cooperation in Europe ([OSCE]{.underline}) [is flexing its muscles to
deal with the European security, through]{.underline} [indigenous means.
Unlike NATO, the OSCE is]{.underline} [made in Europe---by the Europeans
and for the Europeans]{.underline}.

[It is ready to come out of the Viennese concrete walls]{.underline}
[and act as a powerful NEW Concert of Europe]{.underline}. Ambassador
Helga Schmidt---current Secretary General of [the OSCE has]{.underline}
[strategic maturity, operational]{.underline} [clarity]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [human capacity]{.underline} [to offer a]{.underline}
[better security alternative to the Europeans than]{.underline} what
[Stoltenberg]{.underline} can provide. She is assertive, knowledgeable
and persuasive.

I first met young 35-36 year old Helga in the summer of 1997 when she
accompanied her boss, then German FM Klause Kinkel, who came to deliver
a talk at IISS, London. Later, I met Helga in 2013-14 in Vienna and
Geneva when she attended a number of JCPOA sessions assisting Angela
Merkel and Federica Mogherini. Ms. Schmidt played a commendable role to
make JCPOA happen in July 2015---she was dismayed when Donald Trump
withdrew from it in May 2018.

[Headquartered in Vienna, OSCE is fully capable]{.underline} [of dealing
with security-related issues of]{.underline} [all]{.underline} 57
[members in Europe. The Europeans need a robust Concert of Europe to get
rid of]{.underline} obsolete yet [coercive NATO]{.underline}, for which
they, since 1949, have been making regular and equal
contributions---financial, human and collateral---but no equal sharing
of its blessings.

безопасность. Что дальше?," or, "OSCE in the 'New Architecture of
European Security'," Современная Европа, no. 1 (80), 2018, translated by

С момента созыва Совещания по безопасности и сотрудничеству в Европе
(СБСЕ) и в течение более 20 лет концепция общеевропейской системы
безопасности и сотрудничества создавалась совместными усилиями всех
государствучастников в ходе одобрения консенсусом итоговых документов
проводимых в рамках СБСЕ конференций, форумов или совещаний экспертов.

Представители каждого государства имели возможность оказывать реальное
влияние на содержание одобряемых документов и тем самым -- на
формировавшуюся эволюционным путём концепцию европейской безопасности,
учитывающую их суверенные права.

Можно с высокой долей уверенности утверждать, что современная ситуация в
Европе могла бы коренным образом отличаться от нынешней в лучшую
сторону, если бы такой уважительный подход к суверенитету и интересам
безопасности всех государств -- участников СБСЕ, их суверенному
равенству сохранился до настоящего времени. Однако, как известно,
события в Европе после завершения холодной войны и распада Советского
Союза развивались по иному сценарию.

Новая модель европейской безопасности

Организация Североатлантического договора (НАТО) с уходом мирового
коммунизма с международной арены оказалась перед реальной перспективой
прекращения своей деятельности. Вопрос выживания НАТО оказался в
зависимости от возможностей придания блоку новых европейских и
глобальных функций, не связанных с противостоянием мировому коммунизму.

После окончания холодной войны и роспуска ОВД Североатлантический
альянс, продолжая оставаться военным союзом, попытался взять на себя
важные политические функции. Накануне будапештской встречи СБСЕ в 1994
году руководство НАТО пригласило все государства -- участники СБСЕ
присоединиться к Североатлантическому договору. Одновременно государства
-- члены НАТО воспротивились преобразованию Совещания в классическую,
основанную на международном договоре международную межправительственную
организацию и тем самым превращению её в основную несущую конструкцию
будущей системы общеевропейской безопасности и сотрудничества. Они
согласились лишь переименовать Совещание в Организацию по безопасности и
сотрудничеству в Европе -- ОБСЕ. Что и было сделано.

Приглашение Совета НАТО всем государствам -- участникам СБСЕ
присоединиться к альянсу последовало после распада Советского Союза и
социалистического содружества и превращения Соединённых Штатов в
единственную "супердержаву", объявившую себя победителем в холодной
войне. Очевидно в таком своём качестве США не считали более необходимым
и важным искать консенсус по вопросам европейской и международной
безопасности с ослабленной Россией и другими государствами --
участниками СБСЕ, полагая возможным навязать им свою волю. Фактически
Совет НАТО предложил новую модель европейской безопасности,
системообразующим ядром которой должен был стать руководимый США
Североатлантический альянс.

В опубликованном в сентябре 1995 года исследовании о расширении НАТО,
проведённом по решению министров иностранных дел стран-членов,
говорилось, что такое расширение "после окончания холодной войны и
исчезновения Организации Варшавского договора... давало уникальный шанс
построить прочную безопасность на всём евроатлантическом пространстве
без разделительных линий (NATO Handbook, 2001: 61-62). Новая система
европейской безопасности должна была, по замыслу, создаваться усилиями
государств, разделяющих ценности запад- ной демократии, исходя из
презумпции, что "демократии друг с другом не воюют". ОБСЕ в этих
условиях становилась площадкой для рекрутирования новых членов НАТО из
числа её государств-участников, а институты и структуры ОБСЕ --
инструментами преобразования существующих в них политических режимов в
аналогичные западным.

Таким образом, прежний подход к созданию системы общеевропейской
безопасности и сотрудничества, построенный на учёте принципов
суверенитета государств и их суверенного равенства, уступил место
идеологизированному и крайне политизированному подходу западных
союзников, который разделяли далеко не все государства -- участники
СБСЕ. При этом речь шла не о декларативной приверженности западных стран
такой модели построения европейской безопасности, а о системе
взаимосвязанных и согласованных мер, нацеленных на её практическое
внедрение.

Since the convening of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe (CSCE) and for more than 20 years, the concept of a pan-European
system of security and co-operation has been developed jointly by all
participating States through consensus approval of the outcome documents
of CSCE conferences, forums or expert meetings.

Representatives of each State had the opportunity to have a real impact
on the content of the approved documents and, thus, on the
evolutionarily formed concept of European security, taking into account
their sovereign rights.

[It can be said with]{.underline} a [high]{.underline} degree of
[confidence]{.underline} [that the]{.underline} [current situation in
Europe]{.underline} [could]{.underline} [radically differ from the
current one]{.underline} [for the]{.underline} [better, if]{.underline}
such a respectful approach to [the]{.underline} sovereignty and
[security interests of all CSCE member States]{.underline} [and
their]{.underline} [sovereign equality]{.underline} [were]{.underline}
[preserved to this day. However]{.underline}, as you know, [events in
Europe after the end of the Cold War]{.underline} and the collapse of
the Soviet Union [developed according to a]{.underline} [different
scenario]{.underline}.

A new model of European security

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), with the departure of
world communism from the international arena, faced a real prospect of
ending its activities. [The question of]{.underline} [NATO\'s
survival]{.underline} [has become dependent on the possibility of giving
the bloc]{.underline} [new European and global functions]{.underline}
that are not related to countering world communism.

After the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the ATS, the North
Atlantic Alliance, while remaining a military alliance, attempted to
take on important political functions. On the eve of the Budapest CSCE
meeting in 1994, the [NATO]{.underline} leadership [invited]{.underline}
all [CSCE member States]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [join
the]{.underline} North Atlantic [Treaty]{.underline}. At the same time,
the [NATO]{.underline} member States [opposed]{.underline} [the
transformation of the Conference into a classic]{.underline}
international [i]{.underline}nter[g]{.underline}overnmental
[o]{.underline}rganization based on an international treaty [and thus
turning it into the main supporting structure]{.underline} [of
the]{.underline} [future system of pan-European security]{.underline}
and cooperation. [They only agreed to rename]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} Meeting the Organization for Security and Co --
operation in Europe ([OSCE]{.underline}). Which was done.

[The NATO]{.underline} Council\'s [invitation to]{.underline} all [CSCE
member States]{.underline} to join the alliance [came after the collapse
of the]{.underline} [Soviet Union]{.underline} [and the]{.underline}
Socialist Commonwealth and the [transformation of the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [into the]{.underline} [only
"superpower"]{.underline} to declare itself the winner of the Cold War.
Obviously, [in this capacity, the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [no longer considered it]{.underline}
[necessary]{.underline} and important [to seek]{.underline}
[consensus]{.underline} [on European and international security issues
with]{.underline} a weakened Russia and other [CSCE member states,
considering it possible to impose its will]{.underline} on them. In
fact, the [NATO]{.underline} Council [proposed a]{.underline} [new
model]{.underline} [of European security, the]{.underline} [strategic
core]{.underline} [of which was to be the]{.underline} [US-led North
Atlantic Alliance]{.underline}.

A study published in September 1995 on the expansion of NATO, which was
decided by the Foreign Ministers of its member countries, stated that
such expansion "after the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of
the Warsaw Pact Organization \... offered a unique chance to build
strong security in the entire Euro-Atlantic area without dividing lines
(NATO Handbook, 2001: 61-62). The new system of European security was
supposed to be created by the efforts of States that shared the values
of Western democracy, based on the presumption that "democracies are not
at war with each other." [Under these circumstances, the]{.underline}
[OSCE]{.underline} [became a]{.underline} [platform for
recruiting]{.underline} new [NATO members]{.underline} from among its
member states, [and]{.underline} the [OSCE]{.underline} institutions and
[structures]{.underline} [became tools for transforming]{.underline}
[existing]{.underline} [political regimes into]{.underline} similar ones
to [Western ones]{.underline}.

[Thus, the]{.underline} [previous]{.underline} [approach to creating a
system of pan-European security and cooperation]{.underline}, based on
the principles of State sovereignty and their sovereign equality,
[has]{.underline} [given way]{.underline} [to the]{.underline}
ideologized and highly [politicized approach]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} the [Western allies]{.underline}, which was [not
shared]{.underline} [by all CSCE member States]{.underline}. At the same
time, it was not about the declarative commitment of Western countries
to such a model of building European security, but about a system of
interrelated and coordinated measures aimed at its practical
implementation.

#### Linking OSCE cooperation to NATO [poisons the well]{.underline} for reviving the organization.

[A]{.underline} greater [challenge]{.underline} [to the OSCE
collaborative problem-solving efforts has been the rising tension
between Russia and the West]{.underline}. During the early 1990s,
[Yeltsin and other Russian leaders embraced the organization as the
potential centerpiece]{.underline} [for a future]{.underline}
[collaborative]{.underline} European [security
architecture]{.underline}. [In subsequent years]{.underline}, however,
the [Western]{.underline} [participating States placed increasing
emphasis on]{.underline} expanding [NATO]{.underline} and the EU, to the
detriment of the OSCE. The expansion of NATO to include Poland, Hungary,
and the Czech Republic in 1999, and an additional seven states including
the Baltic republics in 2004, [drove home the view among Russian leaders
that the OSCE was "erecting a wall within itself]{.underline},
[artificially]{.underline} [dividing]{.underline} [its members
into]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline} and EU members, [and
the]{.underline} [rest]{.underline}." Under these new conditions,
declared Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, "NATO deals with
security issues, the EU with economic issues, while the OSCE will only
monitor the adoption of these organizations' values by countries that
have remained outside the EU and NATO."35

In the late 1990s, Western criticisms of Russia's military campaign in
Chechnya, along with Russian unhappiness over NATO's bombing of Kosovo
and Serbia, created further frictions, which intensified after the
election of Vladimir Putin as President of the Russian Federation in
2000. [Russia's leaders increasingly expressed suspicions that the OSCE
agenda was]{.underline} "[destabilizing]{.underline} its neighborhood
and in the long run potentially also [Russia]{.underline} itself."36
They were particularly unhappy with the work of the Office for
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which they saw as
"regionally biased against the East."37 Beginning in 2002, Russia sent
its own observers to monitor elections in the post-Soviet states,
alongside monitors from the OSCE and EU, in order to counter the
"Western bias" in ODIHR's conclusions. On Russia's insistence, the OSCE
also sent observers to monitor elections in Western participating
States, including Canada and the United States.38 Russian leaders
accused the OSCE of being a tool of Western interests in Ukraine both
during the Orange Revolution of 2004 and during the political crisis of
2014, and bridled at ODIHR's repeated criticisms of election
irregularities in Belarus. Unnamed Western states, claimed Putin in
2007, were "trying to transform the OSCE into a vulgar instrument
designed to promote the foreign policy interests of one or a group of
countries."39

#### Duplication DA\-\--the perm signals that the OSCE is redundant with NATO\-\--that erodes its organizational identity which makes its leadership unsustainable.

5 CONCLUSION

The positive aspect of the Report is the suggestion regarding the
adoption of a constitutional charter for the OSCE. This is, in our view,
the most relevant aspect. From that fact, several further positive
consequences would develop. First of all, the clearer international
legal status of the organisation would put the OSCE on the same footing
of existing European organisations. Secondly, better defined organs with
their hierarchical position and their powers would strengthen the
operational aspects of the organisation. Thirdly, the organisation could
enter into proper agreements with other international organisations, in
particular the European ones and the United Nations. These tools would
enhance the visibility of the organisation in the international context
and would possibly get more support in the general public opinion.
Nevertheless, this solution seems not sufficiently addressed within the
Report. As we have tried to point out, this step would imply both
political and legal issues that may not be easily solved. Some states
may not be interested in having a strong political organisation dealing
with a broad range of security issues ranging from minority rights to
disarmament. Due to the broad concept of security adopted by the OSCE,
this would imply relevant scrutiny in many sensitive areas of states'
policy. Furthermore, [the risk of overlapping]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [multiplication of activities]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} [existing European organisations]{.underline} [should
be addressed to avoid criticism regarding misuse of funding
and]{.underline} [duplication of activities by the OSCE]{.underline}.
The new charter might address these issues and clearly define the areas
of activity. In areas covered by other international organisations some
form of cooperation could be envisaged. This issue [becomes]{.underline}
[more]{.underline} [difficult in the area of security]{.underline},
[with]{.underline} the EU and [NATO]{.underline} [expanding]{.underline}
their membership towards the East [and their action into the domain of
security broadly interpreted]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} the
reason [why the OSCE has to come to a better definition of its
status]{.underline} [otherwise it might risk erosion by the]{.underline}
new [activities of those organisations]{.underline}. [The positive
aspect of OSCE is that it includes a wide area of states]{.underline}.
[It is European but it includes also]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[USA]{.underline} and Canada, [Russia]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
[Central Asia]{.underline}n countries. [The dividing line based
on]{.underline} the [Cold War confrontation]{.underline} [has been
replaced]{.underline} [by]{.underline} the [membership of]{.underline}
the EU and [NATO]{.underline} and by criticism of Western European
countries towards all other participating states. Nevertheless, [the
broad area covered by the OSCE today]{.underline}, including central
Asia, [would comprise geographic zones that may represent important
security concerns for Europe]{.underline}. In this context, it should be
noted that still little interest is placed on the Mediterranean
dimension of security. This area should receive more attention as it
presents many aspects related to security. They include, among others,
human trafficking, terrorism and environmental issues. These policy
issues can be addressed in due course, but the institutional definition
of the OSCE has high priority, and after thirty years it is high time to
transform it into a proper international security organisation, under
the aegis of international law.

Для нормализации отношений с альянсом российское руководство настаивает
на возвращении к ситуации, документально зафиксированной в
«Основополагающем Акте Россия -- НАТО», подписанном в 1997 г. обеими
сторонами «на основе твёрдого обязательства, принятого на высшем
политическом уровне».

В документе говорилось, что Россия и НАТО будут содействовать укреплению
ОБСЕ, включая дальнейшее развитие её роли в качестве основного
инструмента превентивной дипломатии, предотвращения конфликтов,
урегулирования кризисов, постконфликтного восстановления и регионального
сотрудничества в области безопасности, а также укрепления её оперативных
возможностей по осуществлению этих задач. «ОБСЕ в качестве единственной
общеевропейской организации безопасности играет ключевую роль в
поддержании европейского мира и стабильности».

Развитие событий в последующие годы показало, что в действительности
НАТО в огромной степени действовала по принципу от противного,
утверждая, будто именно она -- единственный гарант мира в Европе.

Одно из ключевых положений Акта гласит: государства -- члены НАТО
подтверждают, что не имеют намерений, планов или причин для
развёртывания ядерного оружия на территории новых членов и не имеют
необходимости изменять любой из аспектов построения ядерных сил НАТО или
ядерную политику НАТО, а также не предвидят необходимости делать это в
будущем. «Это включает тот факт, что НАТО приняла решение о том, что не
имеет намерений, планов или причин создавать места хранения ядерного
оружия на территории этих стран ни путём строительства новых объектов
хранения ядерного оружия, ни путём приспособления старых объектов
хранения ядерного оружия». При этом в НАТО как-то бы стро «забыли» о
своих юридически зафиксированных обязательствах «предотвращать
какие-либо дестабилизирующие наращивания сил в различных регионах Европы
и в Европе в целом».

В документе было зафиксировано принципиально важное положение о том, что
он «не затрагивает и не может рассматриваться как затрагивающий главную
ответственность Совета Безопасности ООН за поддержание международного
мира и безопасности».

Два года спустя жестокими бомбардировками Югославии НАТО прямо нарушила
свои обязательства, действуя в обход СБ ООН. Причём в нарушение такого
принципа Акта, который предписывает «предотвращение конфликтов и
урегулирование споров мирными средствами в соответствии с принципами ООН
и ОБСЕ».

Предельно вольно интерпретируется в НАТО её обязательство осуществлять
свою коллективную оборону через обеспечение совместимости, интеграции и
потенциала усиления, «а не путём дополнительного постоянного размещения
существенных боевых сил». На практике «постоянное размещение» попросту
подменяется размещением на ротационной основе, а размытое понятие
«существенные силы» не несёт на себе какую-либо ограничительную
нагрузку.

Американскому руководству надо было бы ещё четверть века назад
прислушаться к дальновидному предупреждению авторитетного дипломата и
аналитика Дж. Кеннана, известного своим вкладом в разработку концепции
сдерживания нашей страны, который обладал уникальными знаниями о её
возможностях и потенциале: «Расширение НАТО станет роковой ошибкой
американской политики во всей эпохе после холодной войны. Такое решение
с высокой долей вероятности приведёт к разжиганию националистических,
антизападных и милитаристских тенденций в российском общественном
мнении. Оно будет иметь негативные последствия для развития российской
демократии, вернёт атмосферу холодной войны в отношения Востока и
Запада, а также направит внешнюю политику России в направлениях, которые
абсолютно будут нам не по нраву» \[6\].

[To normalize relations with the alliance]{.underline}, the
[Russia]{.underline}n leadership [insists on returning to the situation
documented in the]{.underline} \"[NATO-Russia Founding
Act]{.underline}\", signed in 1997 by both sides \"on the basis of a
firm commitment made at the highest political level.\"

[The document stated that Russia and NATO will contribute to the
strengthening of the OSCE]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} further
[developing its role]{.underline} [as the main]{.underline} [instrument
of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention, crisis management,
post-conflict reconstruction and regional security cooperation, as well
as strengthening its operational capabilities]{.underline} to carry out
these tasks. a key role in maintaining European peace and stability.\"

The development of events in [the following years showed that in
reality]{.underline}, [NATO]{.underline} [largely acted on]{.underline}
the principle of [the]{.underline} [opposite]{.underline}, [claiming
that it was the only guarantor of peace in Europe]{.underline}.

One of the key provisions of the Act states: NATO member States confirm
that they have no intentions, plans or reasons for deploying nuclear
weapons on the territory of new members and do not need to change any
aspect of the construction of NATO\'s nuclear forces or NATO\'s nuclear
policy, nor do they foresee the need to do so in the future. \"This
includes the fact that NATO has decided that it has no intentions, plans
or reasons to establish nuclear weapons storage sites on the territory
of these countries, either by building new nuclear weapons storage
facilities or by adapting old nuclear weapons storage facilities.\" At
the same time, NATO would somehow \"forget\" about its legally fixed
obligations \"to prevent any destabilizing buildup of forces in various
regions of Europe and in Europe as a whole.\"

The document contained a fundamentally important provision that it
\"does not affect and cannot be considered as affecting the primary
responsibility of the UN Security Council for the maintenance of
international peace and security.\"

Two years later, with the brutal bombing of Yugoslavia, NATO directly
violated its obligations, bypassing the UN Security Council. And in
violation of the principle of the Act, which prescribes \"conflict
prevention and settlement of disputes by peaceful means in accordance
with the principles of the UN and OSCE\".

NATO\'s commitment to implementing its collective defense through
interoperability, integration, and reinforcement capabilities is
interpreted very loosely, \"rather than through additional permanent
deployment of substantial combat forces.\" In practice, \" permanent
deployment \"is simply replaced by rotational deployment, and the vague
concept of\" significant forces \" does not carry any restrictive load.

A quarter of a century ago, the American leadership should have heeded
the far-sighted warning of the authoritative diplomat and analyst J. R.
R. Tolkien. Kennan, known for his contribution to the development of the
concept of deterrence of our country, who had unique knowledge of its
capabilities and potential: \"The [expansion of]{.underline}
[NATO]{.underline} [will be a]{.underline} [fatal mistake]{.underline}
[of American policy]{.underline} in the entire post-Cold War era. [Such
a decision is highly likely to incite]{.underline}
[nationalist]{.underline}, anti-Western, [and]{.underline} [militaristic
tendencies]{.underline} in Russian public opinion. [It will have
negative consequences]{.underline} for the development of Russian
democracy, [return the cold war atmosphere]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[relations]{.underline} between East and West, [and direct Russia\'s
foreign policy in directions that we will]{.underline} absolutely [not
like]{.underline}\" \[6\].

#### Russian membership in NATO [fails]{.underline}\-\--OSCE [solves]{.underline}

1.1. Benefits and drawbacks of russian membership in NATO

The starting point of arguments expressed by [proponents of the Russian
membership in the Alliance]{.underline} was the assumption of gradual
removal of the ideological heritage from the era of the Cold War. A
fundamental precondition of their arguments was the modification of
approaches of one actor to another that could result in formation of new
order in Europe and in more effective activities aimed at elimination of
modern globalised security threats. Taking into account that NATO
Eastern enlargement has been repeatedly labelled as a threat to Russian
national interests, Kupchan (2010) and even Karaganov (2011) until 2014
[considered Russian accession to the Alliance to be the way to ensure
peace and to create partnership relations between these subjects.
Additionally, they claimed that Russian membership in NATO would lead
not only to elimination]{.underline} [of one]{.underline} very [serious
obstacle]{.underline} [to]{.underline} current [cooperation]{.underline}
[between these parties, but also to a formal removal of remnants of the
bipolar world order]{.underline}. Needless to say, NATO's era of
expansion would, thus, be concluded. Bearing in mind significant
influence of Russian foreign policy on the politics of Ukraine, Georgia
and other Near-Abroad countries, if the proposed scenario in NATO-Russia
relations came true, it would be highly expected that these countries
would join the Alliance, too.

[Leaving aside claims that due to the current Ukrainian crisis and that
relations between NATO and Moscow entered a new stage of the Cold War,
if the internal security tension on the European continent was
removed]{.underline} [and the Alliance survived]{.underline}
([through]{.underline} [Russia joining]{.underline} NATO), [we could
severely question that the legitimacy]{.underline} [of the
military-political organization in the post-bipolar world would be
strengthened]{.underline}. Consequently, it would be easier to redefine
its fundamental purpose. [Russian accession to NATO would result in
sustainability of NATO control over the security development in the
Euro-Atlantic region and to some extent also in the territory of the
Asia-Pacific]{.underline}. Due to the above mentioned reasons,
[liberals]{.underline} [believe that accession of Russia to NATO would
enhance the credibility of the organization]{.underline} [from the
perspective of non-Western powers]{.underline}. These facts would most
likely lead to increased lifetime of the Alliance, which is, according
to Karaganov, currently ensured only owing to the passivity and lack of
motivation shown by its European member states. Furthermore, the Russian
decision to join NATO would serve as evidence of Karaganov's belief that
there is currently no such military-political organization in the
EuroAtlantic region which would be capable to replace the Alliance
efficiently, notwithstanding NATO's numerous faults and mistakes
(Karaganov, 2011). [Stability of relations between Moscow and other NATO
member states within the framework of the organization would imply a
trend of bias against excessive]{.underline}
[securitization]{.underline} [of issues closely related to east-west
division of power]{.underline} during the era of bipolarity toward the
opportunity to focus on global security threats or those outside its own
territories, provided that norms of international law are abided by.

Apart from the aforementioned issues, opinions of Kupchan and
NATO-skeptical Karaganov were also complementary when it came to
questions of security and geopolitical consequences of Russian
membership in NATO. Karaganov (2011) was convinced that due to its
financial and technological limitations, the security of Russia could
only be ensured by its orientation either on the European Union or on
NATO. However, recalling the lack of European motivation to promote its
security and defensive capabilities and to act as a recipient of
benefits of membership in NATO, he did not consider the
military-political cooperation between Russia and the EU to be more
acceptable than the option of Russian membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. On the other hand, Ariel Cohen (2014), of the
Heritage Foundation, reminds that after using its rather outdated
military in a 5-day war in Georgia in August 2008, Moscow has been
determined to invest heavily in its military and defense capabilities.
Consequently, Russian armed forced have been experiencing a process of
radical modernization with 730 billion USD to be spent between 2011 and
2020 (mostly during presidency of V. Putin) to buy new conventional arms
and upgrade the existing ones. He believes that extensive secrecy around
the budget for procuring conventional weapons alongside rather explicit
public declarations announcing development of cutting-edge nuclear
missiles (as demonstrated by President Putin in February 2018, just
weeks ahead of presidential elections in Russia) shall provide Moscow a
sufficient amount of time to catch up with military capabilities of the
USA to ensure Russian security in broader geopolitical terms without
need to rely on other subjects of the international relations. In light
of aforementioned facts and latest quality of relations between Russia
and NATO, it should not be surprising that the Russian military exercise
"Zapad" conducted in September 2017 was watched by NATO and its allies
with bigger caution than ever before.

Charles Kupchan (2010) analyzed the same problem through the prism of US
and NATO interests. He explains that an expanded NATO membership base to
Russia would lead to decrease in European military dependence on the USA
and, as a matter of fact, to increased defense capabilities of Europe as
a whole. It is important to note that such a state is a shared interest
of both parties and is explicitly defined as a goal in the conceptual
documents of both Russia and the Alliance. Growth in European defense
capabilities combined with stability of the European security politics
due to a guarantee that NATO member states cannot attack each other,
would stimulate yet again the chance to focus on global or interregional
security threats mentioned earlier.

As long as Russia becomes a member of NATO, its status would be formally
and practically equal to all other NATO member states. Hereby the
long-term objective raised by many Russian pragmatists (incorporated
even in National Security Concepts and Foreign Policy Concepts of the
Russian Federation) and Western liberals such as Daniel Deudney, Gilford
John Ikenberry or Charles Kupchan e an objective that the USA and NATO
exclude Russia from discussions on European security issues and that
they disregard its national interests e would lose its ground. On the
other hand, NATO could benefit from Russian involvement in the
structures of the Alliance from a long-term point of view given the
present geopolitical development and shifting center of the world
economy and politics in the Asia-Pacific region. For NATO, Russia could
significantly improve the quality of its relations with non-Western
powers, especially with the countries of BRICS.2

Except for the aforementioned reasons, liberal schools of international
relations see the need for Russian membership in NATO by quoting the old
saying, "Keep your friends close, but your enemies even closer." Based
on experience from the era of Napoleonic Wars and World War II,
emphasized even more after the War in Ukraine in 2014, it suggests
including former adversaries in creating a post-bipolar order of
international relations on the basis of equality. Application of this
principle is seen as a key precondition of the establishment and
maintenance of stability among the regional powers. Politically,
liberals believe that current discrepancies in opinions on several
political and security issues, which have their roots in different
historical developments, do not pose a problem in the case of Russian
accession to NATO. This conviction is supported by the current state of
the Alliance, which is multi-speed in its nature and so is an
economically and military-politically diversified international
organization.

Last but not least, if Russia joined NATO, greater pressure could be put
on the need of intra-organizational reforms within the organization.
Since the necessity of changes finds its place in the articles of its
latest strategic concept and 2010 Expert Report, the Alliance is aware
of them but does not find sufficient political will to implement them.
Positive effects could be visible for instance in lower relative
financial burdens being put on individual states of expanded Alliance e
just like in the prospect of building joint missile defense systems by
both parties. On the other hand, it is highly probable that the long
awaited reform of decision-making and voting procedures would not be
affected by accession of Russia to NATO. Considering the right of veto
granted to each member state owing to the current system of consensual
decision-making, Moscow would likely defend this principle in the same
way as they would with unanimous voting in OSCE, protection of its right
of veto in the UN Security Council or in the European Security Treaty
proposed by Russia but was turned down by the West. Consequently,
providing Russia joins NATO it is rational to expect that model of
ad-hoc coalitions, which is frequently used in these days, will not make
way to activities approved by consensus.

Keeping in mind these aforesaid arguments, Kupchan (2010) and Duleba
(2002: 173) suggest two alternative time frames regarding the accession
of the Russian Federation to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Firstly, they introduced the process of gradual rapprochement of the two
parties with a prospect of eventual membership. According to this
scenario, long-term accession plan with the horizon of ten to fifteen
years should be drafted and later modified in any direction if
necessary. However, Kupchan argues that such process of gradual
rapprochement of political views clashes with the current need to engage
Russia more profoundly in the debates about security issues in the
Euro-Atlantic region. Consequently, he advocates earlier accession of
Russia to the Alliance, even at the expense of unfinished
transformational process of Russian authoritative democracy to a Western
model of democracy. Although he is aware of the risk rising from
Alliance expansion to a country with different form of political
establishment than the other members of the organization, he is
convinced that the risk is lower when compared that of not including the
Russian federation into Euro-Atlantic security structures.

In this matter, [liberal]{.underline} [views are confronted by
pragmatists]{.underline}, [representatives]{.underline} of realistic
schools of international relations, and American neoconservatives. In
the view of the latter democracy. American neoconservative McNamara
(2010) [do]{.underline}es [not see any shared values]{.underline}
[between NATO and Russia]{.underline} e [just shared
interests]{.underline}, [which do not form a healthy basis for their
long-term cooperation.]{.underline} More or less pragmatic
representatives of the Russian School such as Kosachev (2011), Kozlovsky
and Lukin (2012) are aware of this argument as well although until 2014
they did not evaluate it as critically as selected representatives of
the West. Regardless of any contemplations affected by Cold War
ideology, they recognize the significance of this fact and its high
potential to disable Russian accession to NATO, and to complicate their
rapprochement in key areas of regional and global security. The liberal
school represented by Kupchan does not question the analyzed arguments.
In addition, Kupchan admits that an insufficient level of democracy
turned out to be one of the reasons why the Russian Federation had been
excluded from decision-making about the European security. However, he
defends his concept of Russian membership in NATO with motives that made
the Alliance agree with the membership of Portugal and Turkey or the
Alliance\'s drive to offer the membership to Georgia e that is, events
which he puts in contrast with political freedom in those countries at
the time of their accession or accession talks respectively.3 Kupchan
(2010) argues that discrepancies in issues related to shared values and
democracy were then set aside in favour of strategic goals. Since he
observes several parallels between the situation then and present state
of affairs in the politics of the Russian Federation, he believes that
in contemporary international relations characterized by a high degree
of interdependence and security threats implied by regionalization and
globalization, strategic goals should act as a drive for further
expansion of the Alliance to Russia.

Except for the previous conflicting argument, [the accession of Russia
to NATO is very likely to be hindered]{.underline} [in a short-term
period by disunity]{.underline} [of]{.underline} several [groups of NATO
member states]{.underline} as well as political and scientific elites of
the Russian Federation in this matter. On the one hand,
[ratification]{.underline} [of such an enlargement would]{.underline}
probably [fail]{.underline} [due to the persisting influence of
neoconservatism]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the US
[Congress]{.underline}. [Conflicts between declarations by]{.underline}
President [Trump and real US foreign policy]{.underline} since 2017,
[topped with persisting suspicions]{.underline} [about Russian
involvement in the American presidential elections]{.underline} in 2016
[make]{.underline} such [ratification in the USA nearly
impossible]{.underline}. Moreover, [the process of ratification would
also be threatened in countries of former Eastern Bloc]{.underline} [for
whom NATO remains to be a symbol of dissociation from the
USSR]{.underline} [and whose confidence in its de jure
successor]{.underline}, the Russian Federation, [has not
been]{.underline} fully [restored]{.underline}. Last but not least,
[events in Ukraine]{.underline} after 2014, alleged
[Russian]{.underline} [cyber]{.underline} [interventions]{.underline}
into elections or referendums in the United Kingdom, Netherlands, France
or Germany in 2016 and 2017, [disunity]{.underline} [about]{.underline}
achieving common goals in [Syria]{.underline} [and]{.underline} opposing
views on future political [development in Middle-East do not contribute
to more favourable perception of the Russian Federation]{.underline}
either in Europe or North America. On the other hand, [perception of
NATO in Russian society is not unequivocal either]{.underline}. In the
context of debate about national identity and further foreign policy
orientation, [NATO is perceived positively by pro-Western oriented
politicians]{.underline} and the Russian liberal school of international
relations. [However, this view is losing support]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} is [getting]{.underline} [heavily
marginalized]{.underline} [following the events in Ukraine]{.underline}
since 2014. Due to persisting post-Soviet sentiment in Russian society,
extensive securitization of problems related to NATO and strong
discontent with NATO operations regarding Ukraine after 2014, the
Alliance is commonly referred to as a relic of the Cold War. Perception
of Western countries and NATO by the Russian public in the years
following the Ukrainian Crisis aggravates the prospect of Russian
membership in the Alliance even further.

Jacob Poushter (2015) from Pew Research Center and Ariel Cohen (2014)
point out that owing to extensive biased coverage of the Ukrainian
events and other Western activities by Russian government-run media,
compulsory Soviet-style military training at high schools and a large
number of anti-Western bloggers, public support of President Putin\'s
foreign policy has increased from 70% in 2011 to 88% in 2015 despite
worsening economic situation due to European and American economic
sanctions. Conversely, favourable opinions within the Russian public
about NATO and USA in the same period decreased from 37% to 12% and from
56% to 15%, respectively. Given all these conditions Lukyanov (2010)
summarized the opinion of Russian radical nationalists and strict
pragmatists with his conviction that "NATO has clearly outlived itself".
Many times, especially after the controversial NATO operations in Kosovo
in 1999, the military section of the organization and its politically
motivated interpretation of fundamental international legal norms have
been subject to Russian criticism. Taking into account these aspects, it
is not advisable to think that the Russian Federation has a desire to
join the Alliance. Notwithstanding, between 2009 and 2014 Moscow did not
rule out this option from a long-term perspective altogether. Former
president D. [Medvedev]{.underline} [confirmed]{.underline} this during
the 2010 NATO Summit in Lisbon when he stated: "[Russia's accession to
NATO is not an option at present]{.underline} but it could become an
option if NATO changes" (RIA Novosti, 2010). As far as moods in
societies of the two actors were concerned, [proponents of Russian
membership in the Alliance did not come up with any notable suggestions
to improve the situations]{.underline}. Their key precondition in terms
of NATO was positive conclusion of the issue of the Russian membership
within American society and political elites. Consequently, they
believed that it would simplify the persuasion of Central and Eastern
European countries of the Alliance through reassurance that their
territorial defense will be still guaranteed by Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty. At the same time, Russian government should gradually
change unfavourable style of its current communication about the
Alliance with Russian civil society (Kupchan, 2010).

Robert E. Hunter and Sergey M. Rogov (2004), senior advisors of the RAND
Corporation think tank based in Los Angeles, USA, explain another reason
why Russia does not show interest in joining NATO through the prism of a
post-Soviet approach to international relations. Hunter points out that
due to post-Soviet trauma, the Russian Federation might not approve the
equal status with countries of former Eastern Bloc. Their views are
increasingly shared by the Russian schools of international relations.
Timofeev (2017) and Karaganov (2017) explain this shift through
development of Russian armed forces since 2011, Moscow\'s more distinct
involvement in Syrian conflict, the North Korean nuclear program, and
other key global and regional security affairs. Kupchan (2010) agrees
with this opinion indirectly when stating that Russian membership in the
Alliance could eventually lead to sinking solidarity within the
organization.

Unlike other scientists interested in the subject of this paper, Duleba
(2002:173) and Lukyanov (2010) evaluate the issue from military and
operational perspective. In this regard they consider the Russian
membership in NATO to be improbable because such enlargement would
expand the territorial responsibility of NATO considerably, which would
thus be bordering politically unstable countries of central Asia and the
Middle East. Taking into account the cumulative size of contemporary
Alliance and Russia, on the one hand, and lacking availability of
financial resources in economies of all participating countries on the
other hand, they seriously question NATO\'s capability to assure
security of the Russian Federation in compliance with the Article 5 of
the Washington treaty. We believe that from a short-term perspective
even recent modernization of Russian armed forces would not deliver
results that would meet standards of security as identified by the
Alliance. Moreover, Duleba is doubtful about the degree of
interoperability between military systems of Russia and NATO combined
with the degree of mutual confidence in use of military technologies of
the second party.

The last, yet no less important argument used by opponents of Russian
membership in the Alliance, rests on Kupchan's geopolitical optimism
related to the function of Russia as a bridge between Euro-Atlantic
security institutions and nonWestern powers. On the one hand, we are
likely to agree with Kupchan's aforementioned opinion that Moscow's
experience with negotiations with NATO combined with Russian credibility
in the eyes of non-Western powers due to its pragmatism and
authoritative form of democracy that definitely serve as an added value
of the Russian foreign policy. On the other hand, we do not suppose that
accession of Russia to NATO would enable Moscow to take full advantage
of it. Both Kosachev (2011) and Lukyanov (2010) set a question: Would
geopolitical gains of prospective Russian membership in NATO outweigh
the risks inherently connected with such a step? Bearing in mind
shifting the center of contemporary international relations from west to
east, because of its membership in the Alliance Russia would join the
group of states which impact on the world affairs and respect by other
non-Western states and associations gradually decreases. Furthermore,
this NATO enlargement could possibly undermine the quality of relations
between Russia and other key non-Western subjects in the economic and
security-political field e especially with China and Muslim countries.
In the event of extreme escalation of the situation, Russian membership
in the Alliance could result in armed conflict between the parties.
Deterioration of relations would be then rooted in significant change in
nature of bilateral relations between Moscow and those countries and
organizations. Russian accession to NATO would likely be seen by China
and other Asian parties as bias against pragmatism, long-term principle
of promoting multipolar division of power in the international politics,
and as Russian resignation to its position as a Eurasian power in favour
of being solely European power. We dare to assume that providing such
scenario comes true, Russia will no longer be able to take advantage of
and build up its relations with China only because of their similar
style of governance and shared fundamental principles of their foreign
policies. Consequently, Lukyanov (2010) suggests creating a new
trilateral form of cooperation which would dispose with sufficient
strategic impact on resolution of key security issues in Russian Far
East, Central Eurasia and Asia-Pacific space. In his opinion, NATO,
China and the Russian Federation should be included in such forum.

1.2. SWOT analysis

Aforementioned arguments in favour of Russian membership in NATO and
against it serve as a background for further analysis of Russian
strengths and weaknesses and opportunities with threats resulting from
its full involvement in the most influential military-political
organization in Europe. Taking into account these facts, we have
determined the most significant aspects in Table 1 below.

As far as the strengths of the Russian Federation are concerned, all are
rooted in Russia's geographical, historical and political conditions. In
the upcoming geopolitical constellation, Russian size and location,
spreading between powers of the 20th century in the Euro-Atlantic region
and powers of the 21st century in Asia-Pacific, and bordering with
important region of Middle East, shall serve as one of the major
advantages of Russian foreign policy. Considering its size, location and
ownership of extensive fossil fuel resources and raw materials, Russia
has long been a significant subject of security in international
relations. Taking into account its involvement in nearly all major
interregional and global security affairs since [\[TABLE 1
OMITTED\]]{.underline} 2013, we assume that its increasing importance is
likely to continue in the future. If Russia became a member of NATO, its
importance could thus serve as a strong incentive toward necessary
intra-organizational reforms within the Alliance such as burden sharing
(see previous section). Furthermore, NATO would find the issue of
redefinition of its post-bipolar purpose less daunting. Historical and
political evolution of Russia, especially in the 20th century, has left
traces on its security independence of the USA and its authoritative
political system. Whereas security independence is welcomed by both NATO
and Russia,4 an authoritative political system based on missing liberal
democracy of the Western style is not praised in the Alliance but
enabled Russia to communicate by-and-large effectively with countries of
Central Asia, Eastern and Southern Asia, Middle East and to some extent
with South America e regions whose influence is likely to rise in the
future.

On the other hand, fundamental weaknesses find their reasons in
political as well as economic spheres. As it has been indicated above,
[the]{.underline} authoritative [political system]{.underline} [of
Russia has negative consequences]{.underline} [as well]{.underline}. Not
only does it prevent any major advances in the search for mutually
acceptable tools to accomplish NATO-Russia or West-Russia shared goals,5
which are in our opinion based on similar values, but also hinders wider
public participation in debate about Russian post-Cold War identity and
long-term strategy of its foreign policy which has continued since the
fall of USSR. Missing firmness in strategy of Russian foreign policy can
be seen in discrepancies between official statements of its political
elites regarding the Asian vector of the foreign policy emphasis on the
one hand, and real emphasis on relations with the European continent on
the other hand.6 To a much lesser extent, diminishing desire to enter
the Alliance in Russian politics and society shall too be mentioned with
this respect. Foreign policy concept which would be widely accepted by
public and by all governmental levels in Russia and which would bear in
mind economic limitations of the country is, thus, indispensable.

Apart from political aspects, the state of Russian economy should be
listed among its weaknesses as well. Since its thorough analysis
requires an extent significantly exceeding the scope of the paper, we
would like to highlight only the most noteworthy features. Firstly, it
is generally known that sectoral division of the economy with a
prevalence of primary sector and energy policy invokes so called „Dutch
Disease" with negative mid-term and long-term economic consequences.
Secondly, post-Soviet psychological remnants in form of bureaucratic
obstacles, bribery, nepotism, extensive legislative regulations and
selective application of rules undermine Russian efforts to attract
foreign investments and advanced technologies. Needless to say, economic
sanctions imposed on Russia by the USA and the EU in the aftermath of
the Ukrainian Crisis combined with low prices of oil and natural gas on
global markets and significant investment into military defense
capabilities instead of social and economic welfare in recent years do
not lead to an improvement of Russian economic situation either. These
factors combined with insufficiently successful diversification of
Russian exports, weaker involvement in foreign trade, in infrastructure
projects and/or development aid to developing and emerging countries
around the globe result in the well-known nickname of the Russian
Federation "A Giant with feet of clay".

All major opportunities that Russia could take advantage of upon
entering the Alliance copy to large-extent arguments in favour of
Russian membership in NATO. From the Russian perspective, that would
mean mainly full and equal involvement in negotiations about European
security. Increasing success in preventing outbreaks of armed conflicts
within the Alliance serves as a powerful incentive. Provided that NATO
expanded to Russia, the USA and all European member states would need to
recognize and adhere to Russian interests as well. Consequently, all
these factors could eventually result in diminishing level of
securitization with respect to European security issues originating in
the Cold War era. Confidence building, implicitly indicated in previous
arguments and increasingly needed particularly after the outbreak of the
war in Ukraine, would be fostered also by transparency-enhancing
measures based on tying former adversaries together. Such a "great
coalition" built on mutual pragmatism and respect could be beneficial,
even within the global environment. Lastly, taking into account current
financial restraints in the economies of Euro-Atlantic region and the
Russian Federation and long-term experience of both parties in
developing military technologies, their close cooperation might cut the
production costs while providing them with technological advantages and
shared know-how to strengthen their status in the global security
environment.

As far as threats are concerned, we are inclined to avoid using terms
"threat and risk" and feel to be more appropriate when "threat, risk and
danger" are used.7 Taking into account the shifting centre of world
economics and politics to the AsianPacific region, we find the danger of
deterioration of Russian relations with China and other non-Western
subjects as the most important one. As it was written before, its
membership in NATO could undermine Russia's status in the eyes of
emerging countries and Russia could not, thus, fully benefit from its
function of "bridge" between the East and the West. Needless to say,
long-term Russian dependence on the European economy (even despite the
economic sanctions imposed by the EU and USA after annexation of Crimea
in 2014), which serves as an undesired feature of Russian foreign policy
and trade especially in the world of the 21st century, would get even
stronger foothold. Objectively, Russia would risk facing a situation
wherein disregarding its membership in the Alliance it would have to
take care of its security to large extent with its own means and
technology because of its large size and interoperability of Russia-NATO
technology and staff e the argument highlighted by A. Duleba and F.
Lukyanov above. Consequently, it could decrease the level of the
Alliances\'s readiness to deploy NATO Response Forces, ability of
strategic initiatives and even its military function. From our
subjective point of view, if Russian membership in NATO turned out to be
the reality in foreseeable future, there would be psychological dangers.
Firstly, despite its full-fledged membership, the Russian federation
could be considered an outsider mainly by CEE countries. Secondly,
bearing in mind persisting post-Soviet sentiment in Russian society, we
cannot rule out that Russia will not feel comfortable if it is put on
equal basis with Baltic countries and CEE regions e territories which
were looked upon as inferior during the era of bipolarity.

1.3. Future of NATO-Russia relations

While attempting to propose scenarios of future order of relations
between Russia and NATO, we can identify five possibilities: maintenance
of current status quo, increasing impact of the USA on the Euro-Atlantic
region, the Russian Federation as a donor of European security, Russian
membership in NATO which would put Russia in the position of recipient
of security, or incorporation of NATO to the organizational structure of
OSCE. We believe that the first three scenarios are hardly manageable in
the current environment of the international relations, and in pursuing
the goal of long-term geopolitical stabilization, they are undesired as
well. In spite of beliefs expressed by both Western and Russian schools
of international relations about lower level of security and the
beginning of the new Cold War after 2014 (Karaganov, 2017; Kortunov,
2017; Timofeev, 2017; Legvold, 2016), calls for deploying more NATO
forces in Poland and Baltic region (Shlapak and Johnson, 2016) and
several measures adopted by the Alliance that indirectly label Moscow as
a security threat,8 significant discrepancies between President Trump\'s
foreign policy statements and actual US foreign policy activities
towards the Alliance during his term cannot be regarded as attempts to
increase US involvement in European security affairs.

Likewise, the prospect of Russia as a donor of European security does
not look likely in next four to five years if we consider not only
Moscow\'s foreign policy shift to the Middle East and the Asian-Pacific
region (Trenin, 2017; Karaganov, 2017), but also opposition of several
CEE countries to such prospect and pro-Atlantic policies introduced in
France and Germany after their presidential and parliamentary elections
in 2017. In spite of its indisputable benefits for both the Alliance and
Russia (such as termination of NATO enlargement, prolonged legitimacy of
NATO, equal status of Russia with other NATO member states and NATO
being better security alternative for Russia than the EU), accession of
the Russian Federation is not possible from a short-term point of view
due to the necessity of ratification by all NATO member states;
existence of post-Soviet sentiment in Russia, and questionable
capabilities to ensure security of the whole extended territory from
Vancouver to Vladivostok. Furthermore, it is also not beneficial enough
from mid-term and long-term perspective.

We are therefore convinced that [keeping Russia outside]{.underline}
[the Alliance]{.underline} and/or a change in decision-making and voting
mechanisms within NATO [are]{.underline} [more acceptable
solutions]{.underline} [which embed the advantages]{.underline} [of
Russian membership]{.underline} in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization [while eliminating drawbacks]{.underline} of such a
situation. Taking into account the size of NATO membership base (29
countries in 2017eone more than in the EU in 2017), it is advisable to
turn unanimous voting exercised in these days into qualified majority
voting (just like in the Council of the EU9 ) and consensual voting if
issues of key importance are dealt with. The most significant
consequence of such change would be lower influence of the USA in
Europe. That being said, it is doubtful that it could be pushed through
as it would imply abandonment of the principle of equality and it would
most probably face opposition from the United States. Therefore, [we
find it more efficient to incorporate]{.underline} NATO [into the
organizational structure of OSCE]{.underline} as its autonomous unit and
govern their intraorganizational relations in the same way as the
relationship between the European Union and the European Monetary Union.
Our conviction is based on the following arguments:

> [OSCE is a credible organization]{.underline} [recognized
> by]{.underline} [high representatives of all]{.underline}: [NATO, the
> Russian Federation and non-Western powers. Both Russia and NATO have
> labelled it and treat it as supervisor over the peace and security in

2\. Conclusion

Debate about Russian membership in NATO has been ongoing for around two
decades. In the light of changes in international relations in the 21st
century and lapse of time since the fall of the USSR, arguments are
shifting away from ideological ones toward pragmatic and rational.

Through the identification of fundamental advantages and disadvantages
of Russian accession to the Alliance we have defined primary strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities and threats that lie before the political
elites in Moscow. In order to take full advantage of Russian strengths
and to eliminate all major dangers and/or risks of membership, we
believe that incorporation of the Alliance into structures of OSCE
serves as a better option. In addition, this constellation could foster
dialogue between NATO and CSTO/CIS, which might create a better starting
point for resolution of issues in Ukraine, the Baltic region, Syria, the
Middle East and Central Asia after 2017, as well as for communication
with China. Moreover, such incorporation does not have significant
potential to threaten opportunities arising from Russian membership in
the Alliance, nor does it intensify weaknesses of the Russian
Federation. Closer cooperation between NATO and Russia within OSCE on an
autonomous basis does not pose obstacles to confidence building,
technology and cost sharing. Bearing in mind adherence to international
law and preference for a peaceful resolution of conflicts by all
participating parties, guarantee of non-aggression should be easily
adopted even within the OSCE. Needless to say, [Russian objection based
on its exclusion]{.underline} [from]{.underline}
[decisionmaking]{.underline} processes [regarding security issues in
Europe would no longer find any backing]{.underline}. Consequently,
adoption of the proposed suggestion does not only have potential to set
long-term foreign policy strategy of the Russian Federation as a
Eurasian country, but also should not hinder Russian efforts to
diversify its economy and foreign trade. Taking into account all stated
above arguments, we conclude that [membership of the Russian Federation
in NATO]{.underline} [does]{.underline} [not have]{.underline} a
[potential to lead to long-term stability of security
environment]{.underline} in Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian regions.

**NATO 22**, "ABOUT NATO," US Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, <https://nato.usmission.gov/about-nato/>

Formed in 1949 with the signing of the Washington Treaty, [NATO is a
security alliance of 30 countries]{.underline} from North America and
Europe. NATO's fundamental goal is to safeguard the Allies' freedom and
security by political and military means. NATO remains the principal
security instrument of the transatlantic community and expression of its
common democratic values. It is the practical means through which the
security of North America and Europe are permanently tied together. NATO
enlargement has furthered the U.S. goal of a Europe whole, free, and at
peace.

[Article 5 of the Washington Treaty --- that an attack against one Ally
is an attack against all --- is at the core of the
Alliance]{.underline}, a promise of collective defense. Article 4 of the
treaty ensures consultations among Allies on security matters of common
interest, which have expanded from a narrowly defined Soviet threat to
the critical mission in Afghanistan, as well as peacekeeping in Kosovo
and new threats to security such as cyber attacks, and global threats
such as terrorism and piracy that affect the Alliance and its global
network of partners.

In addition to its traditional role in the territorial defense of Allied
nations, NATO leads the UN-mandated International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and has ongoing missions in the Balkans and
the Mediterranean; it also conducts extensive training exercises and
offers security support to partners around the globe, including the
European Union in particular but also the United Nations and the African
Union.

MEMBER STATES

The NATO Alliance consists of 30 member states from North America and
Europe. Article Five of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs
against one of the member states, it should be considered an attack
against all members, and other members shall assist the attacked member,
with armed forces if necessary.

List of Member States

Over the past two decades, the Alliance has developed a network of
structured partnerships with countries from the Euro-Atlantic area, the
Mediterranean and the Gulf region, as well as individual relationships
with other partners across the globe. NATO pursues dialogue and
practical cooperation with many partner countries and engages actively
with other international actors and organisations on a wide range of
political and security-related issues.

EXERCISES

The primary role of Alliance military forces is to protect peace and to
guarantee the territorial integrity, political independence and security
of the member states. Alliance forces must be able to deter and defend
effectively. The Alliance remains subject to a wide variety of military
and non-military risks that are multi-directional and often difficult to
predict.

role]{.underline} leading the Implementation Force (IFOR), the
Multinational Stabilization Force (SFOR) and the Kosovo Force (KFOR) in
the former Yugoslavia. [An]{.underline} [alternative]{.underline} [model
is]{.underline} the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO)
[peacekeeping]{.underline} mission, which has been deployed in the Sinai
since 1981. The MFO is funded by a group of donor nations and manned and
supplied by a group of troop-contributing nations. In a similar way,
Ukraine [could invite trusted partners]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
contribute personnel, material and funding to [this effort]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
([OSCE]{.underline}) -- [with a track record of border-management and a
membership enfolding the entire Euro-Atlantic region -- could play a
coordinative role]{.underline}. [Owing to their unique capabilities,
certain NATO members (though not NATO itself)]{.underline}
[would]{.underline} be needed to [provide enabling support]{.underline}.

2.3.3. NATO Actions in Yugoslavia

[A controversial topic with regard to the responsibility of
international organisations]{.underline} [is]{.underline} the attack
carried out by [NATO]{.underline} on Yugoslavia. As is well established,
[NATO is an international legal personality]{.underline} [capable of
engaging in i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations.
[The]{.underline} military [operation]{.underline} [was carried out
based on a]{.underline} [decision]{.underline} [of the]{.underline}
North Atlantic Council, the political [governing body of
NATO]{.underline}. When it became clear that during the bombardments
damages were inflicted on other than military targets on Yugoslavian
territory, NATO paid compensation to individuals whose properties were
damaged. Clearly, the member states did never consent to the execution
of those failed missions. Nevertheless, Yugo-Slavia decided to bring
[claims against the]{.underline} [NATO members separately,
and]{.underline} [not NATO itself]{.underline}, before the European
Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and the International Court of Justice.
NATO is neither a party to the ICJ Statute nor to the ECHR, so there was
no other alternative. This implied that the NATO cover of the missions
had to be lifted in order to effectively bring a complaint. During the
proceedings, [the]{.underline} NATO [members]{.underline} surprisingly
did not bring forth the [argument that it was]{.underline} the
[NATO]{.underline} [carrying out the attacks and]{.underline}
[not]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [member states]{.underline}, and
that the member [states could rely on the liability of the
alliance]{.underline}. Therefore, neither the ICJ nor the ECHR had to
deal with the issue during those proceedings. NATO has the capacity to
Carry out military attacks such as those in Yugoslavia, but was in casu
not called upon to answer for the incurred damages. On the other hand, a
decision of the North Atlantic Council is an authoritative instrument,
and states should be able to rely on its legitimacy when carrying out
the decision as long as they remain within the mandate given.

#### The difference is [vital]{.underline} and [fundamental]{.underline}

Freedom and the Future of NATO," Georgetown Journal of International
Affairs, vol. 3, no. 2, Georgetown University Press, 2002, pp. 51--56

[The U.S. -led]{.underline} military [action]{.underline} in Afghanistan
in response to the attacks of September II [raised]{.underline} a number
of [important issues regarding the future of]{.underline} the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) [and the relationship
between the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
its transatlantic allies]{.underline}. On September 12, , NATO invoked
Arti- cle 5 - the mutual defense clause of the Washington Treaty -
thereby committing NATO to help defend the United States from the
perpetrators of the attacks. Shortly thereafter, NATO sent seven of its
Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) aircraft, crews, and ground
support personnel to assist in the air defense of the United States. In
addition to demonstrating NATO\'s military resolve and buttressing the
political declaration of Article 5» the deployment of NATO AWACS
aircraft also freed up U.S. aircraft for Operation Enduring Freedom in
Afghanistan.

NATO also provided blanket air rights for U.S. aircraft, access to bases
and ports, and other non-combat support. However, NATO did not lead
Operation Enduring Freedom, nor did it develop the International
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) deployed to Afghanistan in the wake of
the American rout of the Taliban. The Europeans expected more of a say
in the planning and execution of operations since the alliance had stood
firm with the United States after the attacks. [Since the
understanding]{.underline} for fifty years [had been that
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would come
to the aid of Europe and lead its defense, it was only natural
to]{.underline} [assume]{.underline} that [Europe]{.underline} [would
play a]{.underline} [large role]{.underline} [if the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [was]{.underline}
[attacked]{.underline}. However, [this was not the case;
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [preferred a
coalition involving NATO]{.underline} [members]{.underline}
[but]{.underline} [not NATO itself]{.underline}.

European [members of NATO asked whether this]{.underline} American
[unilateralism]{.underline} [portended the]{.underline} [end of the
alliance]{.underline}. Americans vigorously denied this, and argued for
a broader conception of NATO. Nevertheless, Operation Enduring Freedom
was a landmark event because [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [chose to use a]{.underline} [loose
coalition]{.underline} [instead]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} [NATO
alliance, a decision that revealed an emerging]{.underline} U.S. -NATO
[relationship in which the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [consults]{.underline} with [NATO]{.underline} on
security issues [but acts]{.underline} [outside the alliance
structure]{.underline} when it is in America\'s interest.

Why the United States Didn\'t Turn to NATO. In the aftermath of
September II, the United States wanted the form of a coalition, but not
the sub- stance, for several reasons. First, the attacks were on
American soil, and consequently the United States had to lead the
response. Although citizens from scores of countries were killed in the
attacks, it was clear that the United States, its people and its
homeland, was the intended victim. Therefore, a response to the
terrorist attacks did not automatically involve NATO. Ultimately, there
was no direct link to Europe. Consulting NATO would have been
unrealistic, and no American administration would have waited for NATO
to form a response.

NATO was also not the United States\'s first choice because there is no
clear consensus on how to interpret the Washington Treaty in the
post-Cold War world. For example, although the treaty does not place
explicit restrictions on NATO operations in a geographical sense or
require United Nations approval for its operations, many members have
conceptual difficulty expanding NATO\'s role beyond the alliance\'s
immediate periphery, especially in the absence of UN man- dates for such
operations. Consequently, [rather than get embroiled]{.underline} [in
discussions regarding the]{.underline} [legality of NATO
participation]{.underline} in Afghanistan, [the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [sidestepped]{.underline} [the
issue and worked with its allies outside of official NATO
channels]{.underline}.

[NATO\'s 28 members are desperately grappling with the question
of]{.underline} [what, exactly, their military club is meant to
do]{.underline} [in this new world of]{.underline} [asymmetrical
warfare]{.underline}, cyber attacks, energy security and the socially
destabilizing effects of climate change and financial collapse.

Old challenges with dangerous new dimensions

picture-alliance/dpa

\"The [challenges]{.underline} that [NATO faces]{.underline} are not
actually that new but have taken on dimensions that [have caused the
organization to rethink its strategy]{.underline},\" a NATO spokesman
told Deutsche Welle. \"[Issues such as]{.underline} terrorism, nuclear
proliferation, climate change, [cyber]{.underline} protection and energy
security [were all included in the current strategy concept]{.underline}
which was signed in 1999. [But since then]{.underline}, terrorism has
spread in scale and intensity, proliferation [has]{.underline}
[accelerated]{.underline} to the point where it is a serious threat and
climate change has opened up many new problems.

\"Cyber-terrorism was first addressed ten years ago but it is only now
that we can see the full scope of its effects while energy security is
most countries\' number one concern this year as we saw recently that
nations can be brought to their knees when their energy supplies are cut
off,\" the spokesman added. \"So what we will see at this summit is a
decision to update the 1999 strategy and an announcement that work will
begin on a new strategic concept to meet these developing challenges.\"

Giles Merrit, the director of Brussels-based think tank Security &
Defense Agenda Forum Europe, agrees that this week\'s summit should
include discussions on a new strategy for the future of NATO.

\"The consensus is that [NATO]{.underline} [has to fashion a new
strategic plan]{.underline} which sets out what it is actually for,\"
Merrit told Deutsche Welle. \"There is an enormous array of ideas within
the organization; from those who see its future as laid out in its
original brief, to protect NATO territory, to those who see it changing
into a global peacekeeping force. But this new plan should also look at
what NATO\'s role should be in the fight against terrorism, and in the
wider Middle East situation. All these topics have yet to be discussed
in detail as NATO enlargement has eclipsed all debates on what role NATO
has in a post Cold War world.\"

Many believe NATO\'s meeting and resolution of its new challenges relies
heavily on an old foe: Russia. Relations with its former Cold War
adversary were frozen last year after the war in the Caucasus and have
barely risen above tepid since. The thawing of the chill between NATO
and the Kremlin will be an important topic this week.

Russian cooperation integral to NATO\'s future

\"NATO relations with Russia really depend on Russia,\" the NATO
spokesman said. \"All of the allies would like Russia to be involved but
most see Russia as part of the problem, not the solution. NATO\'s
ambition is to utilize Russia\'s massive potential to solve our shared
problems but the fact is that Russia is responsible for some of those
problems. The relationship is very difficult and complex. But the truth
is, if we can agree to work together, Russia can really help NATO meet
its new challenges.\"

Giles Merrit agrees: \"NATO\'s relationship with Russia is crucial in
addressing its new threats and challenges,\" he said. \"The fact is that
since the fall of the Soviet Union, NATO, like the EU, has failed to
develop a solid policy for Russia. They deal with it on a case-by-case
and issue-by-issue basis. NATO should look at how it sees Russia in
terms of economy, energy, trade and security. It will see that Russia
has many of the same concerns: Moscow wants stability in the Middle
East, especially Iran; it wants Afghanistan to be secure and it wants
security in the oil and gas-rich Black Sea and Caspian region.

\"NATO should also look at how it handles the new, embryonic Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO), which includes Russia, China and several
central Asian states,\" he added. \"While it is still in its infancy,
this is a security structure which stretches halfway round the world. In
the coming years, NATO\'s relationship with the SCO will be very
important.\"

But it is the battle against the Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan -
where Islamist fighters backed by al Qaeda only have to survive to win -
which is informing much of the alliance\'s thinking and causing it to
take a long, hard look at its strategy.

Strategic rethink central to Afghanistan stability

Experts say a new political strategy is needed in AfghanistanImage: AP

\"Our job in Afghanistan under the UN mandate is clear: to provide the
country with the means to secure itself,\" the NATO spokesman said.
\"We\'re not hiding the fact that is not happening at the moment and
that the efforts to achieve this are tough. This summit is an important
opportunity. We have to reinvigorate our strategy. You will hear a lot
about a \'comprehensive strategy\' in the next few days - this means
focusing on military efforts, increased training, a stronger police
force, a more cooperative Pakistan. It is a key topic of this summit, to
maximize success. Our mission is to help Afghanistan take care of
itself...but the fact is, right now, it can\'t.\"

\"There is a growing awareness that NATO has not been getting it right
in Afghanistan,\" Merrit said. \"This isn\'t a military conflict. This
is a governance problem and is something that NATO is not designed for
or equipped to tackle. NATO can keep the military situation fairly under
control but [this is a political problem for the]{.underline}
[governments of NATO countries]{.underline} [not NATO
itself]{.underline}. Afghanistan [needs]{.underline} [new structures of
governance]{.underline}, society and economy and [to achieve
these]{.underline}, it needs [a]{.underline} [new approach]{.underline}
[which is outside NATO\'s influence.\"]{.underline}

One of the terrors that Moscow has already dangled in the face of the
West is an escalation of the Ukraine conflict. Putin has put his nuclear
forces on high alert, a Sword of Damocles hanging over Brussels and
Washington D.C. [NATO members -- crucially not NATO itself]{.underline}

as the tanks, rocket launchers and artillery that have been sent from

### OSCE CP\-\--2AC

#### The [OSCE]{.underline} fails\-\--they can't paper over [fundamental differences]{.underline} AND [Russian propaganda]{.underline} undermines their credibility 

Andrew **Lohsen 22**, fellow in the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,
D.C., "Can the OSCE Help Resolve the Russia-Ukraine Crisis?," CSIS,
1/12/2022,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/can-osce-help-resolve-russia-ukraine-crisis

Why [the OSCE Is the Wrong Platform]{.underline} . . . for Now

[Despite]{.underline} these [indications]{.underline} of the positive
role the OSCE could play in resolving the current situation, [there are
strong counterarguments]{.underline}. The first is that
[Russia]{.underline} [and the]{.underline} [West]{.underline}
[remain]{.underline} [too far apart on basic positions]{.underline} [to
make use of]{.underline} the [OSCE]{.underline}'s good offices. As a
veteran U.S. diplomat and former OSCE mission head concluded, [the
organization, like]{.underline} [any other]{.underline} multilateral
institution, ["reflects the state of]{.underline}
[relations]{.underline} [among]{.underline} the [nations]{.underline}
[that make up]{.underline} its [membership]{.underline}. [When relations
are]{.underline} [good]{.underline} or most of the member states are
like-minded, [the organization works well. When relations
are]{.underline} [bad]{.underline} [and there are major]{.underline}
[disagreements]{.underline} among members, [that]{.underline} [same
organization]{.underline} [will]{.underline} [not function." For the
OSCE to serve as a]{.underline} useful [platform for discussions,
Russian officials and Western counterparts will need to come to Vienna
with the belief that it is possible to bridge their divergent positions,
and they must have an idea of where common ground might be found. It is
unclear whether]{.underline} the [faint]{.underline} glimmer of
[optimism]{.underline} after the January 10 bilateral meeting between
U.S. and Russian leaders in Geneva [will]{.underline}
[endure]{.underline}. While Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov remarked on the serious and
businesslike tone of the meeting, [little headway]{.underline} [was made
to narrow the negotiating margins]{.underline}. The OSCE's new
chair-in-office, Polish foreign minister Zbigniew Rau, who assumed the
one-year position at the beginning of the year, has indicated his
readiness to hold a dialogue on a revised security paradigm---"provided
that countries do not violate existing norms in order to gain a
privileged position in such a discussion." [Unless]{.underline}
[Russia]{.underline} [drops]{.underline} its more strident
[demands]{.underline}, [negotiations in the OSCE]{.underline} track
[will yield the same results]{.underline} as talks in Geneva and
Brussels.

A second concern is [that]{.underline} [disagreement]{.underline} on
fundamental principles [could lead to]{.underline} a [crisis within the
organization]{.underline}. In its recent proposals to the United States
and NATO, and in statements by top officials, [Russia offered
far-fetched interpretations of "indivisible security" according to which
Ukraine's right to apply for membership in NATO presents a "legitimate"
threat to Russia's security interests]{.underline}. However, [its
disregard of]{.underline} the [specific commitments]{.underline}
outlined in the Decalogue [suggests]{.underline} that [Moscow is
inclined to view comprehensive security as a]{.underline} [rhetorical
fig leaf]{.underline} [rather than a]{.underline} [shared
principle]{.underline} [guiding]{.underline} [relations]{.underline}
between states. Accordingly, [if OSCE participating states were to
engage in a deep, formal discussion of these principles, it is unclear
whether they would be able to reach consensus]{.underline} on previous
shared positions that heretofore were considered the least common
denominator. [Parallels between the current context and the ill-fated
Corfu Process of 2008--2010, which ultimately led to a "near death
experience" for the OSCE, will likely prompt]{.underline} several
[delegations to]{.underline} [refrain from convening for a
summit]{.underline} [to consider existential questions regarding
European security]{.underline}.

Finally, [Russia has]{.underline} [systematically undermined public
confidence in the OSCE]{.underline} [through]{.underline}
[disinformation]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[obstructionism]{.underline}. In recent years, Russia [has
leveled]{.underline} [accusations of bias]{.underline} [against the
OSCE]{.underline}, particularly its Special Monitoring Mission to
Ukraine (SMM), which was established in 2014 to report objectively on
the situation in the country at a time when "little green men" began to
appear in Crimea. Russian [officials and press outlets frequently accuse
the organization of ignoring alleged violations by Ukrainian
authorities]{.underline}, but in reality, many of these allegations are
hyperbolized or cannot be corroborated according to the mission's strict
reporting standards. Elsewhere, [Russia undermined the organization's
long-standing effort to achieve a political resolution to]{.underline}
the [Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline} dispute [by unilaterally]{.underline}
[brokering a]{.underline} [hasty ceasefire]{.underline} agreement
between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 2020, [despite serving as a lead
facilitator of OSCE peace talks]{.underline}. Further [examples
abound]{.underline}. [The Kremlin's tendency to undermine the OSCE,
cast]{.underline} [aspersions on its cred]{.underline}ibility, [and
question]{.underline} [its competence]{.underline} [when it cannot
be]{.underline} [manipulated]{.underline} to serve Moscow's aims [has
taken a]{.underline} [toll]{.underline} [on the organization's
reputation, particularly in]{.underline} [Russia. This makes it more
difficult for an OSCE-brokered outcome to be presented to the public or
to be respected by officials and military leaders in
Russia]{.underline}.

#### Perm do both\-\--regulatory fora are [complimentary]{.underline}, NOT [competitive]{.underline}

Daniel **Mügge 21**, Professor of Political Arithmetic at the University
of Amsterdam, "Cooperation á la carte is the way forward for EU AI
regulation," London School of Economics, 11/26/2021,
https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2021/11/26/cooperation-a-la-carte-is-the-way-forward-for-eu-ai-regulation/

Earlier this year, the EU became the first major jurisdiction to publish
a set of draft rules for artificial intelligence (AI). [There
are]{.underline} good [reasons to keep]{.underline} close legislative
[tabs on AI tech]{.underline}nology. Concerns range from algorithmic
discrimination and distorted democracy to ubiquitous surveillance and
outright oppression.

Beyond these questions loom deeper concerns. A world saturated with
machines able to predict and exploit our fears and desires fundamentally
challenges human autonomy. At the same time, AI-led automation has the
potential to deprive many people of their jobs once the government
debt-fuelled post-pandemic boom peters out. Already, automation has
driven a wedge between the upper and lower echelons of labour markets.
Aided by smart machines, many highly educated workers have seen their
productivity rise, while jobs with more routine tasks, in contrast, have
slowly disappeared.

The European Commission proudly touts a European third way on AI
regulation: rather than letting algorithms serve the state (as in China)
or large corporations (as in the United States), the Brussels approach
aims to put them at the service of people -- 'trustworthy AI', as the EU
slogan puts it. This entails curtailing the freedom afforded to the
masters of AI -- be they governments or companies.

This European approach will encounter two key obstacles. First, by most
measures the EU tech sector already lags those in China and America.
Slamming the breaks on AI applications is bound to widen that gap. After
all, algorithms thrive on 'learning by doing'. The creation of a
European data space and coordinated seed investment by EU member states
is meant to boost the homegrown sector. But whether that's enough to
make European AI more than a sideshow on the global stage is anybody's
guess.

Second, American politicians and pundits alike increasingly frame AI as
a security issue. Earlier this year, the final report issued by the US
National Security Commission on AI portrayed AI as a tech race between
China and the United States, with the loser vulnerable to the winner's
AI supremacy. Such a dog-eat-dog tech world has little patience for the
finer points of AI ethics. Hence, the report implies that Europeans
would be well-advised to climb into the passenger seat of a US-led
alliance of 'freedom-loving' tech powers and leave the steering to
Washington and Silicon Valley.

These forces are pulling European states in opposite directions. Ethical
concerns inspire caution, competitiveness concerns encourage European
boldness, while the security-framing of AI suggests Europe should play a
junior role in a Western alliance. So, what is the way forward?

Cooperation á la carte

[Much of the current debate on the global dynamics of AI regulation is
unduly simplistic, treating 'AI regulation' as]{.underline} though it
were [a]{.underline} [single, monolithic block,]{.underline} to be
[approached]{.underline} [either]{.underline} alone or [in cooperation
with one]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [other
partner]{.underline}. [Instead, a nuanced perspective would]{.underline}
be to [recognise the enormous breadth]{.underline} [of]{.underline} uses
and [regulatory concerns]{.underline} currently [lumped under the
AI-heading.]{.underline}

To be sure, with open economic borders the effectiveness of European AI
rules hinges on what other major jurisdictions do -- the AI field is
rife with 'regulatory interdependence'. What good are EU rules against
invisible discrimination in automated CV-sorting when clients can simply
use US-based services instead? What good are tight privacy rules when we
can import AI systems trained on data unethically harvested from
citizens abroad?

Yet this regulatory interdependence is variegated: in some domains --
say, the global spread of automated weapons systems -- the EU is
entirely dependent on cooperation with other major powers. In others,
such as safety standards for self-driving cars, it can craft its own
rules and testing procedures, quite irrespective of what others do.
[Some applications, such as the resilience of AI-powered infrastructure,
have direct relevance for NATO]{.underline} [as a security
alliance]{.underline}; [others]{.underline}, like rules for
Twitter-algorithms or automated loan approval, [are]{.underline}
[not]{.underline} [security-relevant at all]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} [variegated regulatory interdependence]{.underline}
-- high in some cases, low in others -- [invites a differentiated
approach to global AI regulation]{.underline}. Where global standards
might align with European regulatory goals, they are clearly
preferrable. When such agreement is out of reach, second-best options
emerge: mini-lateral solutions such as shared standards crafted in the
newly minted Transatlantic Technology Council. Mutual recognition of
different but equally stringent standards are also an option, as is
support for private tech-industry standards.

But where EU ethical goals are best served by Brussels forging ahead on
its own -- as it did with the General Data Protection Regulation -- it
should have the courage to do so. [There is no reason to]{.underline}
think the EU will [be]{.underline} well-[served by a
one-size-fits-all-AI-uses]{.underline} [approach to international
regulatory cooperation. It should not blindly give in to the 'are you
with us or against us' logic prominent in American
thinking]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [diverse]{.underline} ethical
[trade-offs AI raises weigh too heavily to be tackled well in a uniform
international mould.]{.underline}

Always heedful of which approach allows it to maximise its digital
sovereignty on any particular issue, the EU should cooperate where
feasible and dare to go it alone where it must. [Such an á la
carte]{.underline} [approach to global regulation has
served]{.underline} the EU [well]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
[many]{.underline} other [fields]{.underline}, from finance and food
safety to pharmaceuticals. [There is no reason to think it would fail in
relation to AI.]{.underline}

#### NATO is key\-\--they have unique institutions for facilitating legal interoperability

[One vital and unique contribution for NATO is facilitating legal
interoperability]{.underline} [among]{.underline} the [Allies to
resolve]{.underline} some of [the most pressing legal
barriers]{.underline} [for AI implementation in future]{.underline}
Allied [operations]{.underline}. [Legal interoperability]{.underline}, a
subset of larger coalition interoperability, [refers to the operational
coordination]{.underline} [around]{.underline} [partner]{.underline}
legal [obligations and interpretations]{.underline}.75 [It ensures "that
within a military alliance, military operations can be conducted
effectively]{.underline} [consistent]{.underline} [with the]{.underline}
[legal obligations of each nation]{.underline}."76 [Legal
interoperability is a]{.underline} [critical component of multilateral
operations]{.underline} [that has]{.underline} thus far
[been]{.underline} [under-examined]{.underline}, [despite its centrality
to successful military operations]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} largely [because]{.underline} "[legal factors have a
bearing]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [everything]{.underline} [in
alliances and coalition operations---from determining basic
'troop-to-task' considerations to decisions regarding the targets to be
engaged]{.underline}---[and]{.underline} the [types of
ordinances]{.underline} [that may be used]{.underline}."77

[To enhance]{.underline} legal [interoperability, NATO can exert its
influence]{.underline} [on how Allies can develop and deploy AI
consistent with their legal obligations through]{.underline} its [unique
standardization capacities]{.underline}. Historically, [NATO has taken
significant steps to bridge the legal gap]{.underline} between Allies
[on critical procedures]{.underline} that bridge responsible state
behavior with such "troop-to-task" considerations. [One instructive
example]{.underline} from past operations [is detention
policies]{.underline} in non-international armed conflicts.78 The
[promulgation of]{.underline} [detention standards]{.underline}
[illustrates the]{.underline} [operational significance]{.underline} [of
NATO's common legal procedures, even for coalitions of the
willing]{.underline} that [formally]{.underline} operate
[outside]{.underline} [NATO structures]{.underline}. By way of
background, the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan had internal debates
regarding the 96-hour security detention time period.79 The United
States advocated extending the 96-hour rule, where coalition partners
insisted adhering to the NATO standard, even though it was not a NATO
operation.80 Generally the detention example illustrates NATO legal

### OSCE CP\-\--NATO Key\-\--OSCE Fails

#### The OSCE [fails]{.underline}\-\--it can't mediate conflicts if the parties aren't open to mediation.

Over the past decade, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in
Europe ([OSCE]{.underline}) [has]{.underline} unwillingly [been
returning to its origins as a Cold War--era Conference]{.underline} -- a
forum [where states and blocs, often antagonistic to one
another]{.underline} [and espousing opposing ideals, can air their
frictions and hostilities and look for ways to overcome
them]{.underline}.

A brief historical review is necessary. The Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) established by the 1975 Helsinki Final Act
was one manifestation of Europe's aspiration to establish an
international order to keep the peace and, as Andrei Sakharov wrote in
his Nobel speech that year, to stress "the link between defense of peace
and defense of human rights".1

However, the CSCE was created without the legal personality other
international organisations possessed, and operated on the principle of
consensus -- i.e., all "participating States" (members) must agree to
every decision. The lack of legal personality, a US demand at the time,
prevented the development of a strong executive and professional cadre
along UN lines, and made such basic operational issues as diplomatic
immunities and customs clearances dependent upon individual states. The
consensus principle, advocated by the Soviet Union, blocked most unified
action except in narrowly defined and relatively uncontroversial areas.
To this day, these two characteristics render the organisation heavily
dependent on and constrained by its participating States.

The end of the Cold War temporarily loosened those constraints and after
1989 the CSCE flowered in the prevailing spirit of pan-European
cooperation. Consensus was the norm, allowing the OSCE to establish
missions throughout the former Soviet Union and Balkans despite the
absence of legal personality. Based on the Charter of Paris (1990),
accepted by all participating States, the CSCE eventually became the
OSCE in 1994 and acted as an executive organisation in matters of
mediation, peace operations and the promotion of human rights and
democratic governance. Russia even allowed the OSCE to establish a
mission in 1995 in wartorn Chechnya; and the Office of Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) deployed election monitoring
missions in states that had not held free elections in living memory, if
ever.

The lack of legal personality and requirement for consensus were moot --
for a time. But as attitudes towards Charter of Paris commitments
fragmented over the last decade, these constraints resurfaced, shrinking
the OSCE's room for manoeuvre. Missions closed, mediation -- never very
successful -- returned to individual states, and the promotion of human
rights and democratic governance met a backlash that brought the
organisation to a standstill. In essence, the OSCE is returning to its
origins as a permanent forum for dialogue only -- with extremely
constrained executive action capabilities -- among states and blocs,
often hostile toward one another.

The OSCE's efforts span a broad range of activities within the three
"dimensions" of its original mandate: security and political-military
affairs (with an emphasis on mediation), economics/environment and the
"human dimension", including human rights and governance. The three
overlap and "cross-dimensional" activities are frequent. Conflict
mediation, peace operations and the promotion of human rights and
democracy remain among OSCE's most important activities to this day and
offer evidence to assess the state of the organisation.

1\. Mediation

[Mediation]{.underline} [became]{.underline} [crucial]{.underline} [to
OSCE efforts]{.underline} in the 1990s [with the outbreak of armed
conflicts]{.underline} in the wake of the Soviet collapse. [The OSCE has
mediated]{.underline} in [several "frozen conflicts" in the former
Soviet space]{.underline} ([namely]{.underline} [Karabakh]{.underline}
in Azerbaijan, [South Ossetia]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[Abkhazia]{.underline} in Georgia [and]{.underline}
[Transdniestria]{.underline} in Moldova) [and in Ukraine]{.underline}, a
conflict that was on its way to becoming frozen even as intense fighting
raged. As an OSCE Head of Mission succinctly put it, "[the conflicts
themselves are not frozen -- only the peace processes
are]{.underline}".2 The last ten years have seen progress through
international mediation in only one of the four "traditional" frozen
conflicts listed below. Because the OSCE's efforts regarding the
conflict in Ukraine are so bound up with its observer deployments there,
they will be examined in the following section on peace operations.

Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Karabakh conflict: The Karabakh conflict
began in 1988 and intensified to full-scale military operations in 1992,
ending in Armenian military victory and a ceasefire in 1994 that left
the Karabakh Armenians in control of large areas of Azerbaijan but
without international recognition.3 Large-scale hostilities broke out
again briefly in April 2016 and for an extended period between September
and November 2020, during which Azerbaijan reclaimed lands it had lost
and the southern part of Nagornyy Karabakh.4

In 1992 the Italian CSCE Chair-in-Office attempted to convene a Minsk
Conference to resolve the conflict. It never met: the sides imposed
mutually contradictory conditions for participating. The Chair then
created a Minsk Group to steer negotiations. The Group's co-chairs --
Russia, France and the United States (US) since 1997 -- took over its
functions, but in practice acted autonomously on behalf of their three
countries, not the OSCE. After Dmitry Medvedev assumed the Russian
presidency in 2008, Russia came to dominate the mediation process.
Medvedev, eager for foreign affairs accomplishments in what he called
Russia's "sphere of privileged interests", mediated negotiations between
Armenia's Serzh Sargsyan and Azerbaijan's Ilham Aliyev, convening them
to eleven summits during his presidency. The US and French co-chairs
became passive. They helped prepare papers for the negotiations and
received debriefs afterwards but played no role in the meetings
themselves. After the failure of Medvedev's final attempt in Kazan in
2011, the Minsk Group ceased to play a significant role. It made no
contribution to mediation following either the April 2016 fighting or
the more recent hostilities in September--November 2020, in both of
which Russia mediated unilaterally. After the 2020 war, Azerbaijan's
President Aliyev bluntly stated that the OSCE Minsk Group played no role
in resolving the conflict.5

Georgia and the Abkhazia/South Ossetia conflicts: Hostilities broke out
in both regions with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in late 1991.
By 1993 Russianbacked separatists had emerged victorious and forced
Georgia to accept Russian peacekeeping forces. Since then the sides in
these conflicts have never engaged in good-faith negotiations on a
political settlement. The CSCE was mandated to lead mediation in South
Ossetia and deployed unarmed military monitors there; in Abkhazia it
assisted the United Nations (UN), which mediated negotiations and
maintained a large observer mission mandated only to observe Russian
peacekeepers. After the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, Russia recognised both
separatist polities as independent states and blocked renewal of both
the UN and OSCE mandates. Those missions closed. The European Union (EU)
Monitoring Mission in Georgia took on the patrolling function in October
2008.

Since then, the OSCE has co-chaired the Geneva International Discussions
(along with the UN and the EU) and the Incident Prevention and Response
Mechanism, which meets in Ergneti, near the Georgian--South Ossetian
frontline. Neither forum covers political resolution of the conflicts.
They deal with day-to-day security and humanitarian issues. The most
political issue is the process of "borderisation": Russian peacekeepers
fencing off territory previously controlled by Tbilisi. In 2014--15,
following the Crimea crisis, Russia concluded treaties that integrated
significant executive authorities of the entities into the respective
Russian government institutions, including the foreign affairs, military
and security apparatuses.6 This crypto-annexation has put the process of
resolving the overarching political conflict into a further deep-freeze.

Transdniestria conflict: 7 In 1991 pro-Soviet forces, fearing that
Moldova would unify with Romania, declared independence on the left bank
of the Dniester River. A short war followed in which Russian and local
forces secured the separation of Transdniestria from the rest of Moldova
and the deployment of a Russian peacekeeping force to protect it.
Communication between populaces on both sides of the river remained
robust, however, with constant crossings for family visits, commerce,
education and transit. Because the lack of a settlement caused little
inconvenience and there has been no threat of resumed combat, there has
been correspondingly little impetus to reach a compromise settlement. In
2003, while official negotiations were ongoing mediated by the OSCE,
Russia and Ukraine, Russia opened a secret second channel of
negotiations, aiming to secure peace on its own terms, including
favourable geopolitical orientation and military basing rights in
Moldova. The attempt failed. In 2006 official negotiations were broken
off.

The past decade has seen some progress from OSCE mediation between the
two banks of the Dniester, as well as repeated Russian attempts to
bypass the "5+2" process in which Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE mediate,
with the US and the EU participating as observers. Before 2009, the
Communist government in Moldova tried to persuade outside powers to
force unconditional capitulation on Transdniestria. From 2009, when a
pro-European government gained power, the OSCE focused its attention on
laying the groundwork for renewing official negotiations: promoting
one-on-one meetings between the two sides' negotiators, resurrecting
moribund sectoral working groups, hosting conferences with security
officials from both sides in Germany and Austria, and working with the
EU and United Kingdom (UK) on dialogue projects.

In June 2011, Russia tried once again to bypass the OSCE and broker a
peace unilaterally. The attempt failed when Russia's negotiator
circulated three different -- and mutually contradictory -- draft
declarations within ten days.8 Soon thereafter, in September 2011, the
OSCE persuaded the leaders of Moldova and Transdniestria to restart
official negotiations. This success, however, owed more to the leaders
themselves than to the OSCE. Moldovan premier Vlad Filat was willing to
ignore his cabinet and advisors to meet Transdniestrian leader Igor
Smirnov at Bad Reichenhall, in Germany. For his part, Smirnov was aware
that Russia wanted to oust him and would oppose him in upcoming
Transdniestrian "presidential" elections, and he therefore sought
support from the West. On such a flimsy basis, the renewed negotiations
went nowhere: Smirnov was out a few months later. His successor, more
obedient to Russia, obstructed progress. The OSCE redoubled its efforts,
especially under the German chair in 2016. Much progress has been made
on the "packet" under discussion since then, but that packet consists of
humanitarian and confidence-building measures that may improve the lives
of people on both sides of the river but do not comprise a comprehensive
resolution of the conflict.

That episode illustrates several important points: mediators do not make
peace, the sides in conflict do (indeed, mediators who are also involved
in the conflict, and therefore also have a stake in the outcome, can
play a negative role). The willingness of the sides' leaders to make
peace is wholly dependent on their calculations of what will preserve
and increase their power. Humanitarian and confidence-building measures
do not threaten the power or lives of leaders. While they do not settle
conflicts, negotiating them is valuable for three reasons: 1) the
measures themselves have intrinsic value; 2) they give the sides a stake
in, and familiarity with, the negotiations that produce them, preparing
the sides to move on to more substantive negotiations; and 3)
negotiating these measures gives sides a forum for raising their
concerns, which can prevent or delay a recurrence of active hostilities.

2\. Peace operations: The case of Ukraine

A peacekeeping role has often been raised for the CSCE/OSCE, first in
1992 with the suggestion of "Yellow Beret" OSCE peacekeepers for the
Karabakh conflict. OSCE observers were deployed in the South Ossetia
conflict from 1992 to 2008. An OSCE Chair's Personal Representative
participated in a supporting role in implementing the Dayton Accords for
Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1995 to 2015. The OSCE rapidly deployed an
international police presence to Kyrgyzstan during widespread unrest in
2010.

The OSCE peace operations in Ukraine since the crisis erupted in 2014 --
the Special Monitoring Mission (SMM), the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG)
and the Observer Mission at the Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk
(OM) are, together, the largest endeavour the OSCE has undertaken in the
last decade, and perhaps the most consequential. Today they deploy over
700 monitors from 44 OSCE participating States. The military and
political situation changed rapidly in 2014-- 15, with armed hostilities
in eastern Ukraine falling into three phases: "hybrid war", Ukrainian
"anti-terrorist operations" and a Russian-backed counter-offensive.
Finally, the conflict cooled into a simmering pattern of ceasefires with
frequent violations.

Flexibility was the key to the SMM's transitions through these phases.
It was created before armed hostilities broke out in eastern Ukraine.
Negotiations on forming a mission for national reconciliation began on 2
March 2014. By 21 March, when the OSCE Permanent Council authorised the
SMM, unrest was engulfing much of eastern Ukraine and Russia had annexed
Crimea. The project staff quickly found themselves becoming conflict
monitors. Russia's price for agreeing to the deployment was barring the
SMM from Crimea. The monitors were not allowed to operate in areas along
the Russian border and had no enforcement powers. The OSCE's lack of a
legal personality meant that the SMM had to use the umbrella of the NATO
office in Kyiv merely to open a bank account.

The Mission's initial reporting9 describes the outbreak of civil unrest:
on 1 March in Donetsk, on 6 April in Luhansk and Kharkiv, on 12 April in
Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, and by 17 April in Mariupol. Civil unrest
quickly turned into what came to be known as a "hybrid war".10 In
Ukraine the term meant Russian "little green men" (that is, Russian
military units operating on the ground without insignia) and pro-Russian
separatist forces hiding among activists, pretending to be Ukrainian
civilians as they took over city governments by occupying buildings. A
campaign of this type depends for success on the target state treating
all opposing forces -- fighters and civilian protestors alike -- as
fellow citizens and refraining from using force against them. On 17
April the foreign relations chiefs of Ukraine, Russia, the United States
and the European Union met in Geneva. Their statement called for
de-escalation measures and called upon the SMM to play a leading role in
helping Ukrainian and local authorities implement them.11 Daily SMM
reports track the spread of unrest fomented by "armed opponents of the
central government".12 Although the government in Kyiv announced that it
was engaged in an "antiterrorist operation",13 this appears to have been
aimed at militarily useful objectives outside the main towns, such as
airfields, leaving city administration buildings in the hands of
"activists".

The hybrid war stage ended abruptly on 2 May, when in Odessa Ukrainian
proMaidan forces, including "Right Sector" militants, treated "little
green men" and anti-Maidan civilian protestors alike as armed invaders,
not citizens. Forty-two burned to death in the building they had
occupied.14 Over the next few weeks SMM teams mostly reported
consolidation of the sides: the separatists strengthened their hold over
parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, while Ukrainian authorities
regained control over cities outside those regions.

The second phase of the conflict began in late May with heavy clashes in
the Donetsk region as Ukrainian "anti-terrorist" operations began in
earnest. Repercussions for the SMM were immediate. On 26 May,
separatists detained four SMM observers based in Donetsk. On 29 May,
four observers based in Luhansk were taken prisoner. Both teams spent
the next month in captivity.15 On 28 May, eleven observers were detained
west of Donetsk, but were released later the same day. The SMM made a
point of continuing its work in both regions, demonstrating the
international community's resolve not to be intimidated. As clashes
increased, the mission gradually changed from observing hybrid war to
monitoring full-scale hostilities.

Initially, Ukrainian forces met with some success, leading Russia to
accept international talks in the Normandy Format (France, Germany,
Ukraine and Russia) on 6 June. That meeting in turn led to an 8 June
meeting of the Trilateral Contact Group (OSCE, Russia, Ukraine), chaired
by the experienced Russian-speaking Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini, who
was appointed as special representative by the OSCE's Swiss
Chair-in-Office. Thus the OSCE, which had a presence on the ground in
eastern Ukraine, was tasked with conducting the day-to-day negotiations
that Germany and France had put in motion. Petro Poroshenko, elected
president of Ukraine on 5 May, took office on 7 June and by 20 June had
proposed a peace plan. Peace negotiations began in earnest, paving the
way for the 27--28 June release of the two groups of OSCE observers who
had been held captive by separatists since late May.

Russia took steps, however, to roll back Ukraine's advances on the
battlefield. The third phase of the conflict was marked by a more or
less open (though rigorously denied) Russian military presence in
Donetsk and Luhansk. Moscow sent both personnel and heavy weapons across
the border. As the Russian presence grew, the separatists were able to
reverse Ukrainian gains. An early event of this new stage was the
downing of a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine on 17 July 2014, killing
all 298 persons aboard. A Dutch Safety Board forensic investigation,
granted access through OSCE intervention, confirmed that the cause was
an anti-aircraft missile from a Russian-military BUK system spotted
earlier in the hands of separatists. The Dutch Ministry of Justice later
identified and charged some alleged perpetrators.16 Energised by the
atrocity, the international community again deputised the OSCE. The OSCE
Permanent Council decided on 18 July to deploy observers to two Russian
crossing posts, Gukovo and Donetsk, on the separatist-controlled part of
the border between Ukraine and Russia to observe traffic between Russia
and the separatists.17 However, the observers were limited to static
posts.

Diplomatic efforts continued over the summer in the Trilateral Contact
Group (TCG). Observers believe the driving force came from Germany,
which was careful never to give the impression that it was acting
unilaterally so as not to raise historical memories and suspicions.
France was Germany's partner in the Normandy Format and the OSCE was the
face of the West in the TCG. On 5 September 2014, the TCG signed the
Minsk Protocol, which established a ceasefire in place and mandated
autonomy talks for Donbas under Ukrainian law. However, the ceasefire
left a Ukrainian salient at Debaltseve, a rail and road junction
controlling traffic between Luhansk and Donetsk. In January 2015 a
Russian-backed offensive began that over the next month encircled,
besieged and shelled the town; the US charged that Russian artillery was
responsible for the shelling.18 A Normandy Format meeting in Minsk
proclaimed another ceasefire on 12 February 2015 ("Minsk II"), but the
offensive continued until Ukrainian troops abandoned Debaltseve on 18
February.

Throughout this period the SMM patrolled in zones of combat and
shelling, staying in close touch with both the Ukrainian military and
the Joint Control and Coordination Commission (JCCC) set up between
Ukrainian and Russian military authorities. The SMM reported extensively
on shelling of civilians by both sides as well as movements of heavy
weapons to the separatists.19 The SMM enhanced its capabilities in
October 2014 by deploying uncrewed aerial vehicles to places
inaccessible to patrols.20 The SMM thus adapted to the outbreak of
full-scale combat by reporting objectively on what both combatant sides
would have preferred to remain lost in the fog of war.

After new frontlines stabilised in Donbas, the role of the OSCE began to
resemble other frozen conflicts, albeit with failures of successive
ceasefires, widespread ceasefire violations and continued casualties.21
The SMM and OM monitored and reported to the international community;
the TCG, meeting every two weeks, negotiated on day-to-day issues; and
the SMM liaised with the Joint Control and Coordination Commission --
which took on the form of combined military commissions seen in other
frozen conflicts, e.g., the Joint Control Commission in the
Transdniestria conflict.

This frozen-conflict system was disturbed in 2016, during Germany's term
as OSCE Chair-in-Office, when foreign minister and OSCE Chair
Frank-Walter Steinmeier cast aside Germany's usual behind-the-scenes
approach and proposed a formula for holding elections according to
Ukrainian law in separatist-controlled areas. The OSCE would monitor the
elections, and if it judged them to be free and fair, an interim
self-governing status would be initiated in exchange for the return of
Ukrainian control over its borders. Despite some back and forth, and
endorsement in 2019 by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the
initiative failed; the separatists ignored the formula and held their
own unrecognised elections in 2018.

To summarise, through the SMM, the Observer Mission at the border points
and the TCG, the OSCE has performed a valuable service since 2014 in
maintaining and managing the international involvement in a dangerous
conflict in the heart of Europe and keeping the international community
informed. Flexibility and nimble navigation of bureaucratic procedures
allowed for quick deployment and rapid adaptation to changing
politico-military environments. The OSCE was able to give institutional
support to the Normandy process and, through the TCG, to blunt
suspicions of German leadership. One factor for success was Russia's
continued view of the OSCE as neutral -- according to one analyst, the
first Russian officers to participate in the JCCC even wore OSCE
armbands.22 This contrasted sharply with Russia's evolving assessment of
the EU. In 2008 Russia agreed to EU observers in the wake of its war
with Georgia. With Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency, the
Russian government adopted the view, previously limited to the
military/security services, that the EU was a rival, not a partner.

But the SMM came at a cost. Just as the OSCE gave Germany a multilateral
screen, it did the same for Russia, lending a veneer of legitimacy to
Russia's assertion that it was a mediator, not a belligerent. Russia
also limited SMM/OM activity: Russia's proxies in Donbas constrained and
intimidated the SMM; and while static observers could see groups of men
of military age and bearing crossing the border, heavy weapons later
seen inside Ukraine entered through crossings beyond their view.

3\. Democracy and human rights

In 2020 the OSCE underwent a leadership crisis. The terms of the four
leaders of its premier institutions -- the Secretary General, the
Director of the ODIHR, the High Commissioner on National Minorities
(HCNM) and the Representative on Freedom of the Media (RFoM) -- expired
in July. They had been appointed three years earlier in a package deal,
and their renewal was expected by consensus. But on 11 June, Azerbaijan
announced that it would oppose renewing the RFoM, the French politician
Harlem Désir, for his "excessive criticism" of the state of free speech
in Azerbaijan.23 Turkey and Tajikistan followed by opposing the renewal
of ODIHR Director Ingibjörg Sólrún Gísladóttir, an Icelandic politician;
ODIHR had often targeted those countries on human rights grounds. In
retaliation France and Iceland, supported by Canada, Norway and Armenia,
vetoed extensions for Secretary General Thomas Greminger, a Swiss
diplomat; and HCNM Lamberto Zannier, the Italian diplomat who had
previously served two terms as OSCE Secretary General.24 The OSCE's
institutions were thus left leaderless for six months, until a new
package deal to fill the posts was reached on 4 December at the OSCE's
annual Ministerial Council meeting in Tirana.25

What caused this crisis? ODIHR had been critical of human rights and
elections practices since its inception in 1991; the RFoM had been
criticising the persecution of journalists since 1998; and their
criticisms had frequently caused irritation in OSCE participating
States, especially those "east of Vienna". But no state had ever blown
up the process of choosing a slate of leaders for the institutions. What
led Azerbaijan -- followed quickly by others -- to take this step?

To answer this question, we must look back to the OSCE's origins. The
Helsinki Final Act of 1975 represented a grand bargain between East and
West. The Soviet Union achieved recognition of its sphere of influence:
its political, economic and security bloc in Eastern and Central Europe.
In return, the West received Eastern recognition that respect for human
rights was a universal obligation and therefore that human rights
anywhere were of legitimate concern everywhere. 26 By the end of World
War II, democracy had become the only legitimate form of governance --
had it not been, the "Democratic" People's Republic of Korea and the
German "Democratic" Republic would have chosen different names -- but
the Helsinki Final Act, adopted while Leonid Brezhnev ruled the Soviet
Union, makes no mention of democracy or the rule of law. That was
remedied in 1990 by the adoption of the Paris Charter.27 As new states
emerged and joined the CSCE/OSCE, they, too, assumed the Charter's
commitments to democratic governance, rule of law and respect for human
rights as universal ideals -- the price of admission to a Europewide
organisation in which small states could speak on equal footing with the
large.

To actualise those ideals, the Charter established many of the OSCE's
current institutions: the Secretariat, the Conflict Prevention Centre
and the Permanent Council (originally the Committee of Senior
Officials), all now in Vienna; and a Committee for Free Elections (now
ODIHR) in Warsaw. The Charter mandated a Geneva conference in 1991 that
led to the creation of the office of the High Commissioner on National
Minorities in The Hague. It mandated the parliamentary outreach that
became the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly based in Copenhagen. The
institutions created by the Paris Charter began the process of turning
the CSCE into the OSCE: from a Conference to an Organization with
executive functions, still dependent on a consensus of the participating
States to ratify its actions, but with rudimentary policy-making
capability. That capability grew exponentially in the early 1990s with
the establishment of many field presences, mostly in the new states,
often war-torn, that emerged from the ruins of the Soviet Union and
Yugoslavia. Each field presence possessed the latitude to pursue
programmes and policies to promote peace, security, democracy, the rule
of law and respect for human rights in places where all these were, when
the Charter was adopted, in very short supply.

The hard truth, however, is that regardless of the hopes and dreams of
many, democracy failed to survive in most of the former Soviet Union
outside the Baltics. In Central Asia, Communist Party first secretaries
remained in place, making a seamless transition to
presidencies-for-life. In the South Caucasus, democratically minded
nationalists only briefly replaced the party leaders. In 1992, warlords
overthrew Georgia's Zviad Gamsakhurdia and installed former Party first
secretary and Politburo member Eduard Shevardnadze as a figurehead
president. To gain real power, Shevardnadze allied with both old Party
figures and young democrats. In Azerbaijan, Abulfaz Elchibey and his
democratic allies in the Popular Front took power in 1992, upon which
Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan's Party boss turned president for life,
reportedly commented, "Such a man will survive one year".28 One year
later, Elchibey was indeed ousted in favour of former Party and KGB boss
and Politburo member Heydar Aliyev. Levon Ter-Petrosyan survived in
Armenia until 1998, when he was ousted by the even more nationalistic
Robert Kocharyan. In Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko won the first
presidential election in 1994 and then installed a Soviet-style
authoritarian regime. More democratic -- but extremely corrupt --
governments emerged in Ukraine and Moldova. Most significantly,
democracy failed in Russia, where Boris Yeltsin's initial promise was
drowned in corruption, organised crime and impoverishment. In all these
countries -- with only partial exceptions in Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia
and Armenia -- the very concept of democratic governance as an ideal was
discredited.

If we take as a proxy for democratic governance the peaceful transition
of power from one leader to an elected opponent without the intervention
of a revolution, coup or uprising, how many times has this happened in
the former Soviet Union (outside the Baltics)? Never in Central Asia,
where presidents have left only through revolution or death -- or, in
the case of Kazakhstan, retirement in favour of a personally designated
successor. Never in Russia, where Yeltsin designated his successor, who
has remained in power since, though nominally changing positions. Never
in Armenia or Azerbaijan, and in Georgia not until 2013, and never
since. The only states to experience multiple peaceful democratic
transitions of government were Ukraine (1994, 2010 and 2019) and Moldova
(1997, 2001, 2016 and 2020).

In place of democratic ideals, nascent autocrats nurtured an ideology of
grievance -- based on the real lawlessness and impoverishment of
immediate post-Soviet life -- that blamed early attempts at democracy
for abasing their countries. In Russia, the Putin narrative holds that
the early 1990s represented a period of misery, disgrace and weakness
that the West exploited to expand at Russia's expense, promoting Western
-- not universal -- "interpretations" of democracy and human rights as a
means of keeping Russia subjugated. This narrative has found widespread
acceptance both inside and outside Russia. It has given political cover
to other states adopting overtly authoritarian measures. They use it to
buttress an ideology asserting that Western "interpretations" of
democracy and human rights are a transplant that corrodes traditional
values, a club to bludgeon sovereign countries into weakness and
submission.29

The OSCE, in its efforts to promote democratic governance and respect
for human rights, never developed an effective strategy to counter this
narrative. ODIHR heads and other OSCE officials presented -- and
continue to present -- the issue in simple terms: participating States
had undertaken solemn commitments to universal ideals and needed to live
up to them. Civil society activists who flocked to ODIHR's Human
Dimension Implementation Meetings in Warsaw, Europe's largest annual
human rights conferences, believed the most effective way to get wayward
states to live up to these commitments was to "name and shame" those who
did not, unaware that figures such as Vladimir Putin could exploit
naming and shaming by the West to boost their domestic standing.

ODIHR election monitoring missions were sent out to "east of Vienna" and
"west of Vienna" countries with equal frequency -- ODIHR was sensitive
to criticism that it thought only "east of Vienna" was worth monitoring
-- but found far more to criticise in the east, especially in Azerbaijan
and Central Asia. From 1999 to 2020 ODIHR issued thirty statements and
reports expressing concern, criticism or condemnation of Azerbaijani
elections or human rights practices and thirty-five about Kazakhstan,
but only sixteen on Russia and eleven on Hungary (mostly about
Roma/Sinti issues). The RFoM similarly found much to criticise in
Azerbaijan: for the same period, the Representative issued seventy-four
statements of concern, criticism or condemnation on Azerbaijan (mostly
for high-profile prosecutions of journalists), but only thirty-eight
about Kazakhstan and seventeen about Hungary. On Russia the RFoM issued
few statements until Putin's return to the presidency in 2012 but has
issued ninety-four since then.

OSCE efforts to promote democratic governance and respect for human
rights in states unreceptive to that message has resembled, over the
last two decades, Sisyphus pushing the boulder uphill, with the slope
steepening after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Already hobbled
since the financial crisis of 2008 by a "zero nominal growth" budgetary
policy, the OSCE suffered from a structural disadvantage imposed by the
consensus principle: all decisions require unanimity, including annual
consent on the budgets and mandates of field presences. To be sure,
field presences had closed in the past: host countries joined the EU and
no longer needed the programmes or services provided by OSCE missions,
or the single purpose for which some presences were established became
obsolete (e.g., the Representative to the Estonian Expert Commission on
Military Pensioners). But in 2010 Belarus took a new step: it closed the
Office in Minsk, whose director was vociferous in raising democracy and
human rights issues. The crisis of 2014 emboldened those who resented
OSCE criticisms. In 2014 Azerbaijan downgraded the OSCE Office in Baku
to a Project Coordinator and closed it entirely the following year. In
2017 Armenia followed suit, closing the Office in Yerevan.

It was only a matter of time before participating States threatened
breaking consensus to promote other demands, and in 2020 Azerbaijan set
off the cycle that vacated the leadership positions in ODIHR, RFoM, HCNM
and the Secretariat. Now that participating States have seen what is
possible, it cannot be unseen and will be difficult to reverse. While it
will be the task of the 2021 Swedish Chair-inOffice (CiO) and her
successors to help re-establish the institutions to carry out their
tasks effectively, the threat of any participating State's breaking
consensus reminds the institutions of the cost of doing their jobs. In a
Zoom webinar with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on 28
January 2021, CiO Ann Linde, Foreign Minister of Sweden, reiterated --
in the same words as previous OSCE officials -- determination to press
for respect for human rights and democracy as commitments undertaken
without reservation by participating States. The drama continues.

Conclusion

[The OSCE has met with]{.underline} decidedly [mixed
results]{.underline} [over the last]{.underline} ten
[years]{.underline}. OSCE [mediators' best efforts were no more
successful than in the twenty preceding years. A mediator cannot make
peace if the sides]{.underline} -- or in some cases, their patrons --
[do not want it]{.underline}. The Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine
can be judged as a success in keeping the international community
informed and involved but the consensus principle and the lack of a
legal personality, which render the OSCE heavily dependent on its
participating States, make it impossible for the OSCE to go beyond the
bounds set by those states, especially when the latter are belligerents.
That limitation is even more severe in the case of promotion of
democratic governance and human rights. [Participating States can -- and
did --]{.underline} [disrupt]{.underline} all [activities]{.underline}
[in these areas. What do these cases tell us about]{.underline}
[where]{.underline} the [OSCE is heading?]{.underline}

In 2016, [following Russia's annexation of]{.underline}
[Crimea]{.underline} [and the]{.underline} [war in]{.underline} eastern
[Ukraine, the OSCE established]{.underline} a [Structured
Dialogue]{.underline} to work on "challenges in the wider
politico-military sphere" [in areas on which East and West were still
capable of finding common ground]{.underline}.30 It followed an earlier
attempt at dialogue, the Corfu Process, created by the Greek CiO in 2009
in the wake of the Russian-Georgian War and Medvedev's proposal for a
new European security treaty.31 [The Structured Dialogue
can]{.underline} [be viewed as a]{.underline} [return]{.underline} to
the CSCE of 1975: [a]{.underline} [permanent conference of
states]{.underline}, most [affiliated with]{.underline}
[rival]{.underline} security, political and/or economic [blocs, whose
purpose was]{.underline} [discussing issues of European security and
cooperation. Given the continuing difficulties the OSCE faces in
carrying out]{.underline} [executive]{.underline} [functions, the
question participating States must ask themselves becomes: "what future
do we want]{.underline} for the OSCE[?]{.underline}" If the answer is a
return to the 1975 CSCE, they need do nothing: the Structured Dialogue
is that future, barring only window dressing. [A]{.underline}
[return]{.underline} to 1975 [would]{.underline} still [leave the OSCE
a]{.underline} [valuable organisation]{.underline}, especially since
some participating States appear to look forward to a return of blocs,
spheres of influence and a more Westphalian and less multilateral world.

[If, however, the participating States want an OSCE capable of carrying
out the executive functions]{.underline} [needed to]{.underline}
[mediate peace]{.underline}, mount effective observer missions and
promote the democratic and human rights commitments they undertook at
Helsinki in 1975 and Paris in 1990, [they must]{.underline} agree to
[strengthen the OSCE's executive capabilities]{.underline} and give the
organisation more autonomy from their own day-to-day pressure. They can
start this process in three ways: the first -- and admittedly most
difficult -- is to amend the process of achieving consensus in choosing
the leadership of OSCE institutions to negate direct threats from
participating States with a particular grievance -- the drama we saw in
2020. We can only hope that [the]{.underline} [certainty of a stalemated
organisation]{.underline} [-- in]{.underline} [every
function]{.underline} -- will serve to concentrate minds.

Secondly, participating States should agree on a legal personality for
the OSCE that will allow it to carry out basic day-to-day tasks that are
now barred -- as we saw, the SMM in Ukraine could not even open its own
bank account. In this regard the position of the United States will be
key, since it represented the original resistance to a legal personality
and a stronger executive. Historically, "Jacksonian"32 US legislators,
suspicious of internationalism, led that charge. After four years of
Jacksonian foreign policymaking by the Trump Administration, President
Joseph Biden and his team face an uphill battle in credibly asserting
that a return of US commitment to internationalism will outlast the new
Administration.33 One step in rebuilding credibility would be
strengthening the OSCE's executive capabilities -- furthering the twin
goals of re-engaging with multilateralism and re-engaging with Europe.

Lastly, states committed to democracy, the rule of law and respect for
human rights need to work together to come up with a better argument for
furthering those goals among all participating States. Merely doubling
down on insisting that these are universal ideals to which those states
undertook commitments has not proved effective in the past and is
unlikely to be effective in the future. [States now]{.underline}
[undermine the OSCE]{.underline} acquis not [by]{.underline}
[challenging]{.underline} democracy, legality or human rights per se,
but rather the meaning ascribed to them by Western powers. Calling those
[ideals]{.underline} aspects of geopolitical struggle, a community of
"[illiberal]{.underline}" [states]{.underline} [now claim]{.underline}s
[the right to define them in Orwellian oxymorons]{.underline}. The
democracies of Europe, still the majority, are fragmented but also
diverse -- which also means they have voices that can bridge the divide.

ОБСЕ или Организация по безопасности и сотрудничеству в Европе --
довольно молодая организация по поддержке безопасности и стабильности
относительно своих коллег, таких как ООН, ЕС или НАТО, создана лишь в
1975 году. Создание Организации по безопасности и сотрудничеству в
Европе было направлено на закрепление 10 принципов хельсинкского
Заключительного акта Совещания по безопасности и сотрудничеству в
Европе: суверенного равенства, неприменения силы и ее угроз, нерушимости
границ, территориальной целостности государств, мирного урегулирования
споров, невмешательства во внутренние дела, уважение прав человека и
основных свобод, включая свободу мысли, совести, религии и убеждений,
равноправие и право народов располагать своей судьбой, сотрудничество
между государствами и добросовестное выполнение обязательств по
международному праву. И по сей день, со времен образования первых
организаций по обеспечению мирного порядка, таких, как Лига Наций,
главной целью мирового сообщества остается поддержание безопасности и
контроль за соблюдением прав человека.

В 1995 году ОБСЕ стала первой организацией, отвечающей за
общеевропейский порядок. Ее спектр действий направлен на предупреждение
кризисов и конфликтных ситуаций, их урегулирование и постконфликтная
реабилитация. Помимо решения вопросов экономики и экологии, укрепления
мира и безопасности в Европе, немаловажным аспектом деятельности ОБСЕ
является защита прав людей. Уважение прав человека и основных свобод
является ключевым элементом всеобъемлющей концепции безопасности ОБСЕ.
Во-первых, идет борьба с торговлей людьми. Действия ОБСЕ против торговли
людьми координируются Управлением Специального представителя и
координатора по борьбе с торговлей людьми. Во-вторых, идет обеспечение
гендерного равенства, свободы религии, слова, передвижения, СМИ.
В-третьих, ОБСЕ выявляет, ищет пути разрешения напряженности между
этническими представителями и устанавливает стандарты прав для групп
меньшинств. Создано Бюро по демократическим институтам и правам человека
(БДИПЧ), которое представляет собой институт по содействию обеспечению
прав человека, развитию демократии и утверждению верховенства закона.

Рассмотрим работу организации на примере Республики Кыргызстан. В летнее
время жители сел югозапада страны сталкиваются с проблемой нехватки
поливной воды. Здесь проживают представители различных этнических групп,
и ограниченный доступ к воде может привести к конфликтам. ОБСЕ
организовала курсы посредников для местного населения для того, чтобы
обученные «вестники мира» могли помочь разрешить разногласия в своих
общинах. Центр ОБСЕ в Бишкеке стремится к долгосрочному позитивному
воздействию на жизнь жителей Кыргызстана, работая в таких сферах, как
укрепление отношений между общинами, укрепление надлежащего управления,
содействие защите прав человека и верховенства закона, а также
продвижение гендерного равенства. Так, браки по договоренности все еще
реальны для многих молодых женщин Кыргызстана. Большое количество таких
браков распадаются, и часто женщина остается одна, затрудняясь
справиться со сложившейся ситуацией. ОБСЕ поддерживает местные
организации, в том числе сеть «Женских Инициативных Групп», которые
оказывают помощь и содействие женщинам, оказавшимся в подобной ситуации.

Все бы хорошо, но везде есть свои изъяны и недостатки. По нашему мнению,
деятельность ОБСЕ недостаточно эффективна. Начнем с того, что
организация не может принуждать государства к миру, так как это
прописано в Хельсинкском документе 1992 года. Она не является
доминирующей на фоне своих коллег, таких как ЕС и ООН. Ей отведена роль
«гуманитарного контролера», который действует в своих геостратегических
интересах, а не следует задаче восстановления мира в том или ином
регионе. Явным примером, на наш взгляд, является ситуация в Украине, где
велись ожесточенные бои в районах Донбасса, Краматорска, Донецка.
Насколько было известно из СМИ, представители ОБСЕ были в местах
напряженности, но это не привело к какому-либо немедленному разрешению
противоречий.

Можно долго рассуждать о проблемах деятельности ОБСЕ и, хотя при ее
гибкой, мобильной работе, она остается ограниченной в своих полномочиях,
что влияет на выполнение своих обязанностей, таких как обеспечение
миропорядка на территории Европы, ведь, повторимся, ОБСЕ не имеет права
силой принуждать страны к миру. По нашему мнению, организация нуждается
в реформах, так как нет ничего неизменного. Всему в этом мире нужно
развиваться.

\[TRANSLATION\]

[The]{.underline} [[OSCE]{.underline}]{.mark} or the Organization for
Security and Co--operation in Europe [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a [fairly
[young]{.mark}]{.underline} organization to support security and
stability [relative to its counterparts]{.underline}, such as the UN, EU
or NATO, established only in 1975. The creation of the Organization for
Security and Co-operation in Europe was aimed at consolidating the 10
principles of the Helsinki Final Act of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe: sovereign equality, non-use of force and its
threats, inviolability of borders, territorial integrity of States,
peaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference in internal affairs,
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of
thought, conscience, religion and beliefs, equality and the right of
peoples to have their own destiny, cooperation between States and the
faithful fulfillment of obligations under international law. To this
day, since the formation of the first organizations to ensure a peaceful
order, such as the League of Nations, the main goal of the world
community remains to maintain security and monitor the observance of
human rights.

In 1995, [the OSCE became the first organization responsible for the
pan-European order. Its range of actions is aimed at preventing crises
and conflict situations, their settlement and post-conflict
rehabilitation]{.underline}. In addition to addressing economic and
environmental issues, strengthening peace and security in Europe, [an
important aspect of the OSCE\'s activities is the protection of human
rights]{.underline}. Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms
is a key element of the OSCE\'s comprehensive security concept. Firstly,
[there is a fight against human trafficking]{.underline}. OSCE actions
against human trafficking are coordinated by the Office of the Special
Representative and Coordinator for Combating Human Trafficking.
Secondly, [gender]{.underline} equality, [freedom of
religion]{.underline}, [speech]{.underline}, [movement]{.underline},
[and the media]{.underline} [are being ensured]{.underline}. Thirdly,
[the OSCE identifies and seeks ways to resolve tensions between ethnic
representatives and sets standards of rights for minority
groups]{.underline}. The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human
Rights (ODIHR) has been established, which is an institution for the
promotion of human rights, the development of democracy and the
establishment of the rule of law.

Let\'s consider the work of the organization on the example of the
Republic of Kyrgyzstan. In the summer, residents of villages in the
south-west of the country face the problem of lack of irrigation water.
Representatives of various ethnic groups live here, and limited access
to water can lead to conflicts. The OSCE has organized mediation courses
for the local population so that trained \"messengers of peace\" can
help resolve differences in their communities. The OSCE Center in
Bishkek strives to have a long-term positive impact on the lives of
Kyrgyz residents by working in areas such as strengthening community
relations, strengthening good governance, promoting human rights and the
rule of law, and promoting gender equality. So, arranged marriages are
still real for many young women in Kyrgyzstan. A large number of such
marriages break up, and often a woman is left alone, finding it
difficult to cope with the current situation. The OSCE supports local
organizations, including a network of \"Women\'s Initiative Groups\"
that provide assistance and assistance to women who find themselves in a
similar situation.

Everything would be fine, but [[there are flaws]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [shortcomings everywhere]{.underline}]{.mark}. In our
opinion, [the OSCE\'s [activities are not effective]{.mark}]{.underline}
enough. Let\'s start with the fact that [[the organization cannot
force]{.underline}]{.mark} [states to [peace]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it
is prescribed in the Helsinki Document of 1992. [It [is not
dominant]{.mark}]{.underline} [[against]{.mark} the background of its
colleagues]{.underline}, [such as [the EU]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[UN]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline}]{.mark} [is assigned the role of a \"humanitarian
controller\" who [acts in]{.mark} his [geostrategic interests]{.mark},
and does [not]{.mark} follow the task of [restoring
peace]{.mark}]{.underline} in a particular region. [[A clear
example]{.underline}]{.mark}, in our opinion, [[is]{.mark} the situation
in Ukraine]{.underline}, where fierce battles were fought
[in]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} areas of
[[Donbass]{.underline}]{.mark}, Kramatorsk, Donetsk. As far as it was
known from the media, [[OSCE]{.mark} representatives
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in places of tension]{.underline}, [but
this did not lead to]{.underline}]{.mark} [any immediate
[resolution]{.mark} of the contradictions]{.underline}.

One can talk for a long time about the problems of [the OSCE\'s
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline} and, [al[though]{.mark}]{.underline}
with its [[flexible]{.underline}]{.mark}, mobile work, it
[[remain]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[limited]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [its [power]{.mark}s]{.underline}, [which
affects the performance of its duties, such as ensuring world
order]{.underline} in Europe, because, again, [the OSCE has no right to
force countries to peace]{.underline}. In our opinion, the organization
needs reforms, since nothing is unchangeable. Everything in this world
needs to evolve.

#### OSCE is wrecked

Daniel **Trachsler 12**, analyst at CCS Analysis in Security Policy,
"The OSCE: Fighting for Renewed Relevance," CCS Analysis, No. 110, March
2012, https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/141518/CSS-Analysis-110-EN.pdf

Loss of relevance

For about ten years now, the [OSCE has been struggling]{.underline}
[against]{.underline} a [loss of relevance]{.underline}. This challenge
stems [from a number of reasons]{.underline}: firstly, [competition from
other actors]{.underline}; secondly, [paralysis]{.underline} of the
organisation [due to an East-West split]{.underline}; [and]{.underline}
thirdly, [its]{.underline} [diffuse profile]{.underline} and low degree
of visibility. Europe's security architecture has changed, and the [OSCE
has become less attractive]{.underline} as a consequence. The expansion
drives of [NATO]{.underline} and the EU [were]{.underline} [crucial
factors]{.underline}. Numerous countries joined these two organisations,
which had more to offer their members than the OSCE did: concrete
security guarantees as well as economic and financial prowess. NATO and
the EU also introduced frameworks of association apart from full
membership, reducing the importance of the OSCE's encompassing nature.

The OSCE also faced competition in its areas of activity. With the
establishment of a common security and defence policy, the EU became
active in areas that had previously been regarded as core competencies
of the OSCE, e.g., election monitoring, conflict mediation and field
missions (e.g. EUPM in Bosnia-Herzegovina, EUMM in Georgia after the
2008 war). This led to a duplication of competencies on unequal terms,
as Brussels has vastly greater resources. There is also an overlap
between the OSCE and the Council of Europe, particularly in the human
dimension of security (e.g., promotion of human rights and democracy).
Vienna and Strasbourg have established co-ordination mechanisms. A
clearer division of labour exists with NATO, which as a defence alliance
guarantees the military security of its members. The UN, in turn, has
recognised the OSCE as a regional organisation, while the OSCE itself
regards support for the UN, e.g. in the area of conflict prevention, as
one of its tasks. Here, too, co-operation and division of labour are
crucial. There is no argument over jurisdiction when it comes to
authorising sanctions and coercive measures, which is done under the
aegis of the UN Security Council.

The renewed East-West divide within the OSCE is also problematic, since
it weakens the organisation's ability to act. [NATO]{.underline}/ EU
[countries stand in opposition to Russia]{.underline} and other
likeminded states, [in the context of the generally tense political
relations between Moscow and Washington, in particular with regard to
the Eastern expansion of NATO]{.underline} and the US development of a
missile defence shield. OSCE-specific factors are also important,
specifically the erosion of the normative consensus among member states
and the crisis of confidence this has entailed. With the end of the Cold
War, the OSCE's human dimension gained in importance. In Copenhagen
(1990) and Moscow (1991), member states agreed that obligations relating
to the human dimension (human rights, democratisation, good governance)
could not be considered as exclusively domestic affairs. The
introduction of relevant instruments ("Moscow mechanism") implied a
curtailment of the sovereignty principle.

This development is meeting with increasing resistance from Moscow. The
dominant view in Russia is that the co-operative strategy of the 1990s
has failed. Western states, it is believed, have ignored Russian
security interests, e.g., with regard to missile defence and the CFE
treaty, and there is a widespread perception that the West has not
respected Moscow's sphere of interests, as evinced by its support of the
"colour revolutions" in Central Europe. Russia makes three accusations
in particular: First, that the human dimension within the OSCE is
overemphasised at the expense of the political/military dimension.
Secondly, that the OSCE resolves the tension between state sovereignty
(territorial integrity, non-intervention, inviolable borders) and
fundamental rights of the people (human rights, self-determination) in a
lopsided manner favouring the latter (e.g., when recognising the
independence of Kosovo). And thirdly, that the geographic equilibrium of
the OSCE's activities has been lost. The OSCE, according to this view,
essentially only intervenes 'east of Vienna', although relevant issues
also exist further West (e.g., Basque country, Northern Ireland). This
criticism culminated in 2007, when Russian President Vladimir Putin
accused the OSCE of having degenerated into a vulgar instrument of
asserting Western interests.

[Due to the consensus]{.underline} [rule, the split]{.underline} between
East and West [paralyses]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[organisation]{.underline}. [Member states failed to pass a joint action
plan]{.underline} at the Astana summit [and did not agree on final
statements]{.underline} [at]{.underline} [several]{.underline}
ministerial [meetings]{.underline}. The [budget]{.underline}
[was]{.underline} also [the subject of frequent dispute. The rift has
led to key]{.underline} OSCE [missions]{.underline} [not
being]{.underline} [extended]{.underline} [or their]{.underline}
[mandates]{.underline} [being watered down]{.underline} (e.g., Georgia,
Belarus, Uzbekistan). Similarly, [Moscow tried to
strengthen]{.underline} [political control]{.underline}
[over]{.underline} the relatively independent [OSCE
institutions]{.underline} (ODHIR, HCNM, RFM). [The]{.underline} current
[logjam]{.underline} has also [impeded]{.underline} any [clarification
of]{.underline} the OSCE's [legal status]{.underline} and the passing of
an OSCE convention. The Western states suspect that [Russia would use
this as an opportunity to]{.underline} [weaken the
organisation]{.underline}'s competencies and limit the autonomy of its
institutions.

[The OSCE's]{.underline} [low]{.underline} degree of
[visibility]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [also not helpful]{.underline}
[to its reputation]{.underline}. Usually, [the organisation only enjoys
media coverage during]{.underline} [election-monitoring]{.underline}
campaigns [and]{.underline} [summit meetings]{.underline}. Aside from
that, [it]{.underline} [rarely]{.underline} [creates]{.underline}
[positive headlines. Its]{.underline} most important
[successes]{.underline} (such as the missions in Kosovo, Croatia, and
Bosnia) [are a]{.underline} [thing of the past. In Europe's]{.underline}
["frozen conflicts",]{.underline} e.g., [in Transdniestr or Nagorno
Karabakh, where the OSCE has long been active, progress is
a]{.underline} [long way off. The]{.underline} [hard day-to-day
work]{.underline} that [the OSCE performs]{.underline} competently in
many places (e.g., Kyrgyzstan mission, activities of ODIHR and HCNM)
often [goes]{.underline} [unnoticed]{.underline} by the public.
[Success]{.underline} in conflict prevention [is]{.underline}
[notoriously difficult]{.underline} to demonstrate. As a result, public
awareness of the OSCE's relevance is limited at best.

[This effect is]{.underline} [further]{.underline} [intensified by the
OSCE's]{.underline} [diffuse profile]{.underline}. After 1989/91, its
activities grew organically rather than in a strategically controlled
manner. This resulted in the currently almost excessively broad range of
activities, from conflict prevention, over the fight against terrorism,
and human trafficking to the promotion of media freedom and trade.
Extending OSCE activities into the domains of energy security and
cybersecurity is also being discussed. Added to this is the lack of
continuity arising from the rotating chairmanship and the limited
strategic planning competencies of the OSCE secretariat. While
cross-dimensional activities are part and parcel of the OSCE, they also
carry the risk of dissipating energy in the absence of clear thematic
focus.

### OSCE CP\-\--NATO Key\-\--Norms

#### NATO is key\-\--they possess unique intellectual and political capital to propagate best practices. 

Dr Ulf **Ehlert 21**, head of Strategy and Policy in the Office of the
Chief Scientist at NATO headquarters, "Why Our Values Should Drive Our
Technology Choices," NATO Review, 12-16-2021,
https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/12/16/why-our-values-should-drive-our-technology-choices/index.html

Setting norms -- a role for NATO?

Emerging and Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) came into NATO's political
focus in 2019, when NATO leaders adopted an implementation roadmap for
seven such technologies. Regardless of their tremendous promise, we must
realise that these technologies are not yet mature, not yet "fully out
there". Therefore, considerable uncertainty remains to which extent
these fledgling technologies and their foreseeable applications are
appropriately contained within established legal, ethical, and moral
norms. These questions are not limited to military applications, nor do
they stop at national borders: rather, they cut across many government
departments and business sectors, and they affect humanity in its
entirety.

In this complex, fast moving, high-stake setting, we must view
technology and values as intertwined. While our values should guide our
use of technology, we must recognise that our technology choices will,
whether intended or not, reflect the values we adhere to.

[As inaction is not an option, we must take active measures to establish
norms]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the [future]{.underline} use of
[technologies; norms that are deeply rooted in our values]{.underline};
[technologies that are currently emerging and have recognised disruption
potential (such as]{.underline} [AI]{.underline}, biotechnology, and
quantum technology). [How could we realistically master this novel
challenge? The following three proposals could pave the
way]{.underline}.

> We must effectively cope with the uncertainties of technology
> evolution. Hence, I suggest evolutionary policy-making, building on
> current knowledge, but flexible enough so that today's decisions can
> be adjusted or corrected in the future.
>
> We must strive to limit potential harm without unduly constraining the
> benefits a technology can bring. Therefore, our policies should set
> limits for the application of technologies (such as genetically
> optimised super-soldiers) rather than banning entire technology areas
> (in this case, biotechnology).
>
> [We need to understand when policy changes are necessary]{.underline}
> and what those changes should be. [Reflecting the diversity of
> interests, we need to institutionalise a broad stakeholder
> engagement]{.underline} that reaches out to all parties affected by a
> technology and influencing its evolution.

Within this broadly applicable framing, [NATO's role is
specific]{.underline}. [As the international organisation committed to
defence and security in the North Atlantic]{.underline} area, [it
convenes considerable political, military, economic, and technological
power]{.underline}. [Building in particular on its political and
intellectual capital]{.underline}, [the Alliance can credibly spearhead
norm setting for technology applications in defence to comply with
Western values.]{.underline}

[With its recently published AI Strategy, NATO fulfils its traditional
role in an innovative way. This Strategy embraces principles of
responsible use, which express the value-driven norms that
NATO]{.underline} and its member [nations will adhere to]{.underline} in
the application of AI. [By making these principles public, they set an
example]{.underline} for other nations to consider and potentially adopt
NATO's principles. This is an effective approach towards proposing and
gradually implementing an international norm, not unlike the European
Union's General Data Protection Regulation.

#### NATO's direct integration into military issues makes it uniquely effective at ensuring compliance with international law.

International legal norms

In certain respects, the legal debate mirrors much of the ethical debate
surrounding AI as the two address many of the same issues. International
law is a values-based system embedded in certain principles and
practices agreed-upon within the international system. This section
certainly identifies the complementarity of the ethical discussion
surrounding AI, but it also illustrates where the legal debate can
depart from the ethical considerations to address different sorts of
legal challenges that face the Alliance.

[Lawyers]{.underline}, researchers, and civil society [grapple
with]{.underline} existing [legal regimes relevant to military
operations and the uncertainty and ambiguity surrounding automated
decision-making, particularly in lethal decision-making. Thus far,
the]{.underline} legal [dialogue has been]{.underline} heavily [anchored
in]{.underline} the applicability of international humanitarian law
([IHL]{.underline}), and other relevant legal regimes, to lethal
autonomous weapons systems.72 IHL, also known as the laws of war or the
laws of armed conflict, regulate the means and methods of warfare and,
as such, is pivotal to the emergence of military technology and how
existing legal structures are disrupted. [The legal debate]{.underline}
often [revolves around the prospect of a "treaty ban" of
LAWS]{.underline}.73

[But the]{.underline} legal [debate is much more nuanced]{.underline}
[than the likelihood of]{.underline} international
[treaties]{.underline} [banning]{.underline} [any particular weapon
system]{.underline}. Especially [because NATO is]{.underline}
[not]{.underline} a [regulatory]{.underline} body, [it]{.underline}
[cannot institute measures to regulate emerging technology for the
Allies]{.underline}. [Instead, NATO's function in the legal domain may
be more effective outside the traditional]{.underline} [legal debates
around emerging military technology and more embedded in fostering
cooperation and coordination among military partners]{.underline}.

[Other avenues of legal regulation may fall short of an international
convention or prohibition, but nevertheless factor
significantly]{.underline} in regulating and/or delineating state
policies. Additionally, non-lethal applications of AI, as well as
applications of AI that do not figure into autonomous systems, also
raise important legal questions under international law. Arguably, norms
around non-lethal applications are more urgent as their development is
more advanced, harder to define, and less controversial in
integration.74 [Ultimately, NATO's]{.underline} [facilitative
power]{.underline} [can help ensure that integration of EDTs like
AI]{.underline} [into]{.underline} [military capabilities]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} into [multinational coalition operations]{.underline}
[is consistent]{.underline} [with]{.underline} member [states' legal
obligations.]{.underline}

### OSCE CP\-\--Perm Do Both

#### The [perm]{.underline} is best\-\--NATO and the OSCE are [complimentary]{.underline}\-\--[combining]{.underline} dialogue [best]{.underline} propagates new security norms

регулирования международных отношений (ООН, ОБСЕ, НАТО)," or

Relations (UN, OSCE, NATO)," Марийский государственный университет,

На сегодняшний день систему международных отношений невозможно
представить без таких организаций, как ООН и ОБСЕ. Современный мир все
больше сталкивается с проблемами вооруженных столкновений, с самого
разного типа кризисными ситуациями. И лучший ключ к разрешению подобных
проблем --- деятельность данных организаций. Нельзя недооценивать всю
значимость миротворческих операций, проводимых ООН, невозможно выразить
всю благодарность деятельности ОБСЕ за проводимые ей планы по
урегулированию кризисных ситуаций, возникших в том или ином регионе. Это
лишь немногие плюсы данных международных организаций. Подводя итог в
данном вопросе, стоит сказать, что значимость ООН и ОБСЕ огромна.
Военнополитический блок НАТО, несмотря на свои сомнительные и далекие от
доверия средства решения возникших проблем, также представляет собой
важного игрока на международной арене и оказывает существенное влияние
на нее. НАТО так же, как ООН и ОБСЕ, способствует эффективному
предотвращению конфликтов и активно участвует в кризисном регулировании.

Помимо собственных целей, которые ставят перед собой данные
международные организации, они также следуют и целям коллективного
характера. Ярким примером взаимодействия двух игроков международной
арены в рамках коллективного целеполагания является взаимодействие НАТО
и ООН.

Вопросы, касаемые кризисного регулирования, объединяют НАТО и ООН.
Уместно будет сказать о правовой основе решения подобных вопросов. Глава
18 Устава ООН и Вашингтонский договор 1949 года подтверждают
приверженность Североатлантического союза основным принципам ООН. НАТО и
ИСАФ (Международные силы поддержания безопасности) тесно сотрудничают с
Миссией ООН по содействию Афганистану, а также и с другими
международными структурами, которые поддерживают работу по
государственному восстановлению, развитию и управлению. Стоит сказать,
что тесное взаимодействие ООН и НАТО проходит в самых различных форматах
как в Афганистане, так и в столицах стран ООН и НАТО. Сюда можно
добавить, что это, прежде всего, совместное членство в Объединенном
совете по координации и мониторингу, осуществляющем надзор за
соблюдением Афганского договора. Однако, несмотря на все вышеуказанные
положительные моменты данного сотрудничества, все же стоит сказать, что,
хотя НАТО и ООН сегодня весьма крупно развивают взаимодействие по
сложным вопросам осуществления безопасности, их отношения нельзя назвать
достаточно крепкими в плане партнерства.

Еще одним примером коллективного взаимодействия является сотрудничество
ООН и ОБСЕ. Здесь важно отметить, что ОБСЕ ведет активный диалог с ООН и
поддерживает с данной международной организацией весьма крепкие
партнерские отношения. ООН и ОБСЕ довольно упорно и слаженно
сотрудничают в сфере раннего обнаружения, своевременного отслеживания и
предотвращения конфликтов и кризисов. Обе международные организации в
своей работе делают упор исключительно на политико-дипломатические и
правовые средства решения возникших проблем в соответствии с уставом
ООН. Как в ОБСЕ, так и в ООН имеется широкий арсенал средств и
механизмом раннего предупреждения конфликтов и недопущения их
перерастания в военные конфликты.

Также стоит сказать, что все вышеперечисленные международные организации
сотрудничают совместно. ОБСЕ и ООН косвенно поддерживают отношения с
НАТО. Однако здесь речь может идти лишь о путях координации усилий НАТО
с деятельностью ООН и ОБСЕ. Рассуждая о дальнейшем сотрудничестве НАТО с
ООН и ОБСЕ, стоит отметить, что у НАТО практически отсутствуют
инструменты решения проблем, которые можно было бы использовать в сфере
превентивной дипломатии. Из этого следует вывод, что было бы довольно
положительно для НАТО чаще прибегать к встречам с Генеральным секретарем
ООН и ОБСЕ, обмениваться информацией, а также привлекать специальных и
личных представителей Генсекретаря ООН, действующего председателя ОБСЕ,
посредников и специалистов в области превентивной дипломатии.

Однако все же, говоря о взаимодействии данных игроков международной
арены, нельзя не сказать об истории их возникновения.

Хочется начать с Организации Объединенных Наций. Данная международная
организация была основана 24 октября 1945 года, именно к этому дню Устав
ратифицировали: Китай, Советский Союз, Великобритания, Соединенные
Штаты, Франция, а также большое количество других подписавших его
государств. Главной своей целью ООН ставит поддержание мира между
странами и народами, предупреждение возможных конфликтов и улаживание
споров дипломатическими средствами.

Говоря об Организации по безопасности и сотрудничеству в Европе, стоит
сказать, что создание этой международной организации приходится на 1975
год. Итоговый акт был подписан в конце июля -- начале августа 1975 года
в столице Финляндии, Хельсинках. С того времени Совет по безопасности и
сотрудничеству в Европе стал проводить свои встречи регулярно. Данная
организация ориентирует свое внимание на таких вопросах, как
предотвращение возникновения конфликтов в регионе, урегулирование
кризисных ситуаций, ликвидация последствий конфликтов.

Закончим данный краткий исторический экскурс информацией об истории
создания и целях военнополитического блока НАТО.

НАТО была создана 4 апреля 1949 года в городе Вашингтон. Стоит сказать,
что с самого начала НАТО была нацелена и ориентирована на полное
противодействие Советскому Союзу, а также и странам --- участницам
Организации Варшавского договора позднее. Сама стратегическая концепция
определяет многие первостепенные задачи НАТО. Выделим несколько:
выступает основой стабильности в Евроатлантическом регионе; служит
форумом для проведения консультаций по проблемам безопасности;
способствует эффективному предотвращению конфликтов и активно участвует
в кризисном регулировании и т. д. В своей деятельности НАТО опирается на
особые программы сотрудничества. Одной из таких является программа
«Партнерство ради мира». Данная программа представляет собой форму
двустороннего практического сотрудничества, особенно в военной сфере,
между НАТО и отдельными странами-партнерами.

Подводя итог рассуждениям по данному вопросу, надо сказать, что
деятельность всех вышеперечисленных международных организаций оказывает
большое влияние на систему международных отношений. Действительно, это
своего рода механизмы работы великой машины, имя которой ---
международные отношения, и каждый механизм важен для продуктивного и
правильного функционирования этого уникального средства для поддержания
дипломатии, диалога и сотрудничества.

\[TRANSLATION\]

Today, it is impossible to imagine the system of international relations
without such organizations as the UN and the OSCE. [The modern world is
increasingly faced with]{.underline} the [problems of]{.underline}
[armed clashes, with]{.underline} [various]{.underline} types of [crisis
situations]{.underline}. And [the]{.underline} best [key]{.underline}
[to solving]{.underline} [such problems is]{.underline} the activities
of [these organizations. It is]{.underline} [impossible to
underestimate]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [importance]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} UN peacekeeping operations, it is impossible to express
all gratitude to the [OSCE]{.underline} for its [plans]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [resolve crisis situations]{.underline} that have
arisen in a particular region. These are just a few advantages of these
international organizations. Summing up on this issue, it is worth
saying that the importance of the UN and the OSCE is enormous. The NATO
military-political bloc, despite its dubious and far from trustworthy
means of solving the problems that have arisen, also represents an
important player in the international arena and has a significant impact
on it. NATO, as well as the UN and OSCE, contributes to effective
conflict prevention and actively participates in crisis management.

In addition to their own goals set by these international organizations,
they also follow collective goals. A striking example of the interaction
of two players in the international arena within the framework of
collective goal-setting is the interaction of NATO and the UN.

Issues related to crisis management unite NATO and the UN. It would be
appropriate to say about the legal basis for solving such issues.
Chapter 18 of the UN Charter and the Washington Treaty of 1949 confirm
the Alliance\'s commitment to the basic principles of the UN. NATO and
ISAF (International Security Support Force) work closely with the UN
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, as well as with other international
structures that support the work on state reconstruction, development
and governance. It is worth saying that close cooperation between the UN
and NATO takes place in a variety of formats both in Afghanistan and in
the capitals of the UN and NATO countries. It can be added here that
this is, first of all, joint membership in the Joint Coordination and
Monitoring Council, which oversees compliance with the Afghan Treaty.
However, despite all the above-mentioned positive aspects of this
cooperation, it is still worth saying that, although NATO and the UN are
developing cooperation on complex security issues on a very large scale
today, their relations cannot be called strong enough in terms of
partnership.

Another example of collective cooperation is the cooperation of the UN
and the OSCE. It is important to note here that [the OSCE
conducts]{.underline} an [active dialogue]{.underline} [with the UN and
maintains very strong partnership]{.underline} [relations with
this]{.underline} [i]{.underline}nternational
[o]{.underline}rganization. [The UN and]{.underline} the [OSCE are
cooperating]{.underline} quite hard and [harmoniously]{.underline} [in
the field of early]{.underline} detection, timely [tracking]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [prevention]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [conflicts
and crises]{.underline}. Both international organizations in their work
focus exclusively on political, diplomatic and legal means of solving
the problems that have arisen in accordance with the UN Charter. Both
the OSCE and the UN have a wide arsenal of tools and a mechanism for
early warning of conflicts and preventing them from escalating into
military conflicts.

It is also worth saying that all of the above international
organizations cooperate together. The OSCE and the UN indirectly
maintain relations with NATO. However, here we can only talk about ways
to coordinate NATO\'s efforts with the activities of the UN and the
OSCE. [Speaking about]{.underline} [NATO\'s]{.underline} further
[cooperation with the]{.underline} UN and the [OSCE, it is]{.underline}
[worth noting that NATO has]{.underline} practically [no problem-solving
tools]{.underline} [that could be used in the field of]{.underline}
[preventive diplomacy. It follows from this that it would be
quite]{.underline} [positive]{.underline} [for NATO to]{.underline}
resort [more often]{.underline} to [meet]{.underline}ings [with
the]{.underline} UN Secretary General and the [OSCE, to]{.underline}
[exchange information]{.underline}, as well as to involve special and
personal representatives of the UN Secretary General, the OSCE
Chairman-in-Office, mediators and specialists in the field of preventive
diplomacy.

However, speaking about the interaction of these players in the
international arena, it is impossible not to say about the history of
their origin.

I would like to start with the United Nations. This international
organization was founded on October 24, 1945, it was on this day that
the Charter was ratified by: China, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, the
United States, France, as well as a large number of other signatory
states. The main goal of the UN is to maintain peace between countries
and peoples, prevent possible conflicts and settle disputes by
diplomatic means.

Speaking about the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe,
it is worth saying that the creation of this international organization
falls in 1975. The final act was signed in late July -- early August
1975 in the capital of Finland, Helsinki. Since that time, the Council
for Security and Cooperation in Europe has been holding its meetings
regularly. This organization focuses its attention on such issues as the
prevention of conflicts in the region, the settlement of crisis
situations, the elimination of the consequences of conflicts.

Let\'s finish this brief historical digression with information about
the history of the creation and goals of the NATO military-political
bloc.

NATO was established on April 4, 1949 in Washington. It is worth saying
that from the very beginning, NATO was aimed and focused on complete
opposition to the Soviet Union, as well as to the member countries of
the Warsaw Pact Organization later. The strategic concept itself defines
many of NATO\'s primary tasks. We will single out several: acts as the
basis of stability in the Euro-Atlantic region; serves as a forum for
consultations on security issues; promotes effective conflict prevention
and actively participates in crisis management, etc. [In its activities,
NATO relies on]{.underline} [special cooperation programs]{.underline}.
One of these is the Partnership for Peace program. This program [is a
form of]{.underline} [bilateral practical cooperation]{.underline},
especially [in the]{.underline} [military sphere]{.underline},
[between]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [individual
partner countries]{.underline}.

Summing up the reasoning on this issue, I must say that the activities
of all the above-mentioned international organizations have a great
influence on the system of international relations. Indeed, these are
some kind of mechanisms of the great machine, whose name is
international relations, and [each mechanism]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [important]{.underline} [for the productive and proper
functioning of this unique means for maintaining diplomacy, dialogue and
cooperation]{.underline}.

Fourth, [strengthening the]{.underline} [regional
structures]{.underline} [for conflict prevention requires]{.underline} a
[great]{.underline} amount of [political will. However, for]{.underline}
[broader inclusion, coherence, and complementarity]{.underline} of
efforts, [and to]{.underline} [avoid]{.underline} risks of [duplication,
international partners should enhance their cooperation at]{.underline}
[all working levels. More]{.underline} [synergy among regional
organizations]{.underline} [will]{.underline} [enhance common
understanding]{.underline} of threats, [exchange]{.underline} of
[lessons learned, and promote]{.underline} [cooperation]{.underline}
[over competition. These efforts]{.underline} can [provide]{.underline}
advanced legal policy training for diplomats and local [capacity
building]{.underline}, which is [crucial]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[follow-up on]{.underline} the [implementation]{.underline} of CBMs. The
OSCE should avail itself of the dialogue channels in place and establish
new partnerships for a comprehensive picture of regional views and
conflict prevention mechanisms.

[Cyberpolicy cooperation]{.underline} and understanding of States' views
and concerns [should build on the]{.underline} significant [overlap in
membership of]{.underline} the EU, [the OSCE, and NATO, organizations
with highly]{.underline} [complementary mandates]{.underline}. While the
EU focuses on strengthening resilience through finance and diplomacy,
the [OSCE's model of]{.underline} [regional security, and]{.underline}
[NATO's]{.underline} [crisis management]{.underline} [capacities could
merge]{.underline} [into]{.underline} [meaningful synergies]{.underline}
[with the purpose of conflict prevention and early warning, common
features of these organizations' mandates.]{.underline}51

### OSCE CP\-\--Perm Russia in NATO

#### Only [offering Russia integration]{.underline}\-\--[even]{.underline} if it [refuses]{.underline}\-\--[communicates]{.underline} NATO's benign intent\-\--[integration]{.underline} solves [broad security coop]{.underline} 

Charles A. **Kupchan 10**, Professor of International Affairs at
Georgetown University and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign
Relations, "NATO\'s Final Frontier: Why Russia Should Join the Atlantic
Alliance," Foreign Affairs, May/June 2010,

Nonetheless, [the West is making a historic mistake]{.underline} [in
treating Russia as a strategic pariah. As made]{.underline}
[clear]{.underline} [by the settlements after the Napoleonic Wars and
World War II]{.underline} \-- in contrast to the one that followed World
War I \-- [including]{.underline} [former adversaries in a postwar order
is critical to the consolidation of great-power peace. Anchoring Russia
in an enlarged Euro-Atlantic order, therefore, should be an urgent
priority for NATO today.]{.underline}

[[Russia has been disgruntled with]{.mark} the
[expansion]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of NATO]{.mark} ever since the
alliance began courting new members]{.underline} from the former Soviet
bloc in the early 1990s. [However, Russia\'s economic and military
decline and the West\'s primacy encouraged NATO members to discount the
potential consequences]{.underline} [of Russian discontent. \"As
American capabilities surged]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[Russian]{.underline} [capabilities waned]{.underline},\" the political
scientists Daniel Deudney and G. John Ikenberry have observed,
\"[Washington policymakers increasingly acted as though Russia no longer
mattered and the United States could do whatever it
wanted]{.underline}.\"

[The]{.underline} [strategic landscape]{.underline} [has since changed
dramatically, however, and [the costs of excluding Russia]{.mark} from
the Euro-Atlantic order [have risen]{.mark} substantially]{.underline}.
The Kremlin\'s recentralization of power and Russia\'s economic rebound
thanks to higher energy prices have brought the country back to life.
[[Russia now has]{.mark} the [confidence]{.mark} and the capability [to
push back against NATO \-- just as the West urgently needs Moscow\'s
coop]{.mark}eration on a host of issues]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} the containment of [Iran]{.underline}\'s nuclear
ambitions[,]{.underline} [arms control]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
non[prolif]{.underline}eration, the stabilization of
[Afghanistan]{.underline}, counter[terror]{.underline}ism,
[and]{.underline} [energy]{.underline} security.

Moreover, [the [ongoing expansion]{.mark} of NATO [has made]{.mark} the
question of [Russia\'s place]{.mark} in the Euro-Atlantic order even
[more pressing]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its new military doctrine,
released this February, [Russia identified NATO enlargement]{.underline}
[as a primary external threat. The alliance has been contemplating
membership for Georgia and Ukraine, a move that would dangerously
escalate tensions]{.underline} between NATO and Russia. Indeed, the
Russian-Georgian war of 2008 was to some extent a reflection of
Moscow\'s disquiet about Georgia\'s westward geopolitical alignment. And
rather than just opposing NATO enlargement, Russia is now offering its
own ideas for revamping the Euro-Atlantic security architecture. In
November 2009, the Russian government released a draft of a new European
security treaty that laid out Moscow\'s proposals for a pan-European
institution. [NATO allies]{.underline}, it seems, [no longer have the
luxury of indefinitely postponing consideration of Russia\'s place in
the post-Cold War settlement]{.underline}.

[[A vision for]{.mark} bringing [Russia into the Euro-Atlantic]{.mark}
space [is]{.mark} readily [within reach: Russia should become a member
of NATO.]{.mark} The country\'s eventual admission to the alliance would
be the logical completion of a Euro-Atlantic order in which NATO is the
primary security institution]{.underline}. Having embarked on the
process of enlarging NATO when the Soviet bloc collapsed, [the Western
allies should now do their best to conclude that process by integrating
Russia and other members of the]{.underline} Commonwealth of Independent
States ([CIS]{.underline}) [into the alliance.]{.underline}

[There are, of course, many other options for pursuing a pan-European
order]{.underline}, such as fashioning a treaty between NATO and the
Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization; elevating the
authority of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), of which Russia is a member; or picking up on Russia\'s proposal
for a new European security treaty. [But now that NATO]{.underline}, the
world\'s most powerful military alliance, [has 28 members and more to
come, these [other options are]{.mark} merely [strategic sideshows.
Countries will be either NATO]{.mark} members [or outsiders. The only
logical path]{.mark} to a pan-European order thus [entails Russia\'s
integration]{.mark} into the alliance.]{.underline}

Russia may ultimately reject inclusion in NATO due to the requirements
and constraints membership entails, instead choosing to go its own way.
[But if the primary institutions of the Euro-Atlantic community
ultimately fail to extend their reach to Russia, let it be due to the
Kremlin\'s missteps, not because the Atlantic democracies]{.underline}
[failed to demonstrate the vision]{.underline} [or]{.underline} the
[will]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [embrace Russia]{.underline} in a
pan-European order.

#### It\'s a [more sustainable solution]{.underline} to tensions with Russia than [stopping]{.underline} NATO expansion.

Third, [[Russia\'s integration]{.mark} into NATO would [enable Georgia
and Ukraine to join]{.mark} the alliance [without]{.mark} provoking [a
crisis with Moscow. According to]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}n political
scientists]{.underline} Sergei Karaganov and Timofei Bordachev, [the
[admission]{.mark} of these countries into NATO would [increase]{.mark}
\"the risk of a [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} with unforeseeable
consequences.\" [[Stopping]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[enlargement]{.mark} of NATO [could avert this]{.mark}
problem]{.underline} [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} [would]{.underline}
[leave another]{.underline} one [unsolved: [How can
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} [and its neighbors]{.underline}
[[be]{.underline} [integrated into a]{.underline}]{.mark} [unitary
[Euro-Atlantic order?]{.mark}]{.underline} As Andrew Monaghan of the
NATO Defense College notes, \"[[Even if enlargement stops]{.underline},
[Russia]{.underline} [remains excluded]{.underline}]{.mark} [from
Euro-Atlantic mechanisms]{.underline}.\"

[[The]{.underline} [solution]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[is for
Georgia and Ukraine to join a]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} [in which
Russia is already]{.underline}]{.mark}[, or is soon to be, [a member,
ensuring]{.mark} that [their entry would cause little, if any]{.mark},
geopolitical [tension]{.mark}]{.underline}. More generally, [[if]{.mark}
membership in [the CIS remains separate]{.mark} from membership in NATO,
Europe\'s [East and West will be]{.mark} [subject to indefinite]{.mark}
geopolitical [division]{.mark} and jockeying]{.underline}
[over]{.underline} [zones of influence. In contrast, [if NATO opens its
doors]{.mark} to members of the CIS, such dividing lines and the
[competition]{.mark} that accompanies them [will]{.mark} likely [fade
away]{.mark}. There is a precedent]{.underline} for this evolution:
[all]{.underline} [of the CIS members already cooperate with NATO
through the Partnership for Peace program and the Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council.]{.underline}
