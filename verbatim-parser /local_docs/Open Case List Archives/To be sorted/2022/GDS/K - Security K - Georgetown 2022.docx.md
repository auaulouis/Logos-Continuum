#### The affirmatives [recalibration]{.underline} of NATO reflects a logic of securitization that inflates threats in order to justify a [bloody war machine]{.underline} that paves the way for attacks around the globe in the name of security 

**Campbell, 19** -- Professor of African American Studies and Political
Science, Syracuse University. (Horace B. Campbell, "Global NATO: A
70-Year Alliance of Oppressors in Crisis," *Counter Punch*, 4-9-2019,
Available Online:

The celebration of [**NATO's** 70 years of **existence** provides
another opportunity to unearth the real history of the **ideas**,
**practices** and **destruction** wrought by this **military
alliance**.]{.underline} Even with the clear exposure of the cooperation
between NATO, the CIA and the British MI6 to spread terror and
psychological warfare in Europe immediately after the formation of this
military alliance, [the mainstream **media**, [**academics** and
**policy makers** remain **silent** on]{.mark} activities of
[the]{.mark} 'stay behind [**armies'** and]{.mark} '**[false
flag']{.mark}** [operations that distorted the]{.mark} **real
[causes]{.mark}** [of **insecurity**]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}
after 1945. The evidence of the manipulations of the peoples of the
world to ensure the continued survival of NATO has been well documented
in the fraudulent interventions and bombings in the Balkans right up the
present multiple wars against the peoples of Iran.

Vijay Prashad had identified NATO as the prime defender of the Atlantic
project. [[This **Atlantic project**]{.mark}, he noted was, "[a]{.mark}
fairly straightforward [campaign by the **propertied classes** to
maintain]{.mark} or restore their position of
**[dominance]{.mark}**."]{.underline} This Atlantic Project [[was
**anchored** in]{.mark} the **military alliance** called
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} with its principal work, that of
reversing the South Project; the struggles for peace bread and justice
by the poorer citizens of the planet, especially those who had emerged
on the world stage after the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and the
Caribbean.

The ostensive reason for the founding of NATO was to 'thwart' Soviet
aggression, but in practice the organization was a prop for western
capital and after the fall of the Berlin Wall, became the core prop for
Wall Street. In this year, there will be many commentaries on the fact
that the existence of NATO reflects a Cold War relic, that NATO is
obsolete and lost its mandate, but [[very few]{.mark} will [link]{.mark}
the **expansion of [NATO]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the [**military
management** of the **international system**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Prior
to 1991, the planners of NATO could justify the existence of NATO on
ideological and political grounds, but [[with the threat of a **multi
polar world**]{.mark} and the **diminution of the dollar**, [NATO
**expanded**]{.mark} to the point where this author joined with others
in labelling this organization Global NATO [to reflect its]{.mark}
current **[imperial mandate]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The Global thrust of
NATO now comprises 29 members from Europe and North America along with
41 'partners' that had started off under the banner of the North
Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) in 1991. Since that time, [NATO has
launched a lengthy **war without end** in Afghanistan, **colluded in**
the **destruction** of Iraq and **conspired with militarists** to forge
'Partnership for Peace' (with most members of the former Warsaw Pact
states).]{.underline} The core 29 members are now enmeshed with treaties
and undertakings from states involved in the Mediterranean Dialog and
Istanbul Cooperation Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab
Emirates. There are also the 'partners' from across the globe:
Afghanistan, Australia, Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan. [[This **enlargement** served
the]{.mark} military [purposes of **encircling** **China** and
**Russia**]{.mark} who military planners in the West
**targeted**.]{.underline}

There is no shortage of literature on NATO and its milestones, but [very
[few]{.mark} have [documented]{.mark} the real crimes of [this **global
network** of **anticommunist operatives** who **precipitated**]{.mark}
real [**terror** and **psychological warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline}
against the citizens of Europe and North America while supporting mass
atrocities from Algeria to Indonesia, and South Africa. Books such as
that of NATO's Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western
Europe by Danielle Ganser and The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen
Dulles, and Their Secret World War, by Stephen Kinzer used rigorous
research techniques to uncover the dark history of NATO. These two books
can be [[**distinguished** from]{.mark} the bland
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations texts that discusses
NATO inside the old [**calculations** of]{.mark}
'**[strategy]{.mark}**,' 'concert of democracies', '**[security
cooperation']{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[balance of power]{.mark}**,'
and **spheres of influence**.]{.underline} Most recently, this IR
rendering of the history of NATO has been served up in a document
entitled, NATO at Seventy: An Alliance in Crisis. Published by Harvard
University with one of the coauthors being a former US ambassador to
NATO. This document spelt out ten challenges.\[1\] However, in a
testimony before Congress, Nicolas Burns boiled down the challenge of
NATO to one objective; that the current role of NATO must be to contain
Russia and China.\[2\] On the day before the actual 70thanniversary, on
April 3, [the Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg delivered an address to
a joint session of the US Congress **[advocating]{.mark}** an
[**expansion** of the alliance while promoting]{.mark} a [**military
buildup** against **Russia**]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[3\] European
progressives will have to reflect deeply on whether the current
sanctions regime and the special propose vehicle called the Instrument
in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX), is ushering in another round of
inter imperialist rivalry reminiscent of the currency wars of 1929-1939.
Then, [the **[shifting alliances]{.mark}** **[yield]{.mark}**ed
[**confusion** among working peoples who]{.mark} ultimately went to
[fight]{.mark} against [each other]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe,
[**[spreading barbarism]{.mark}** throughout the world,]{.underline}
from Auschwitz to Hiroshima.

The continued struggles for bread, peace and justice ensure that it is
only the authoritarian leaders from the Global South who are compromised
on the real meaning of the existence of NATO. [In the present era, there
is a new **capitalist competition** while North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (**[NATO]{.mark}**) [serves]{.mark} as an integral part of
the Pentagon's world **command structure**.]{.underline} Recent
experiences have demonstrated in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya that the
moguls of Wall Street are willing [[to **wage**]{.mark} as many
**[wars]{.mark}**, to **[destroy]{.mark}** as many [**countries**
and]{.mark} to **[kill]{.mark}** as many people as necessary [to achieve
the **dominance** of]{.mark} **US [capitalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
The destruction of Libya was a classic example of the convergence of
finance as warfare, the weaponization of information and incessant
bombing to destroy a society. Where at the start of NATO the war scare
was the propaganda method, [In [the]{.mark} current **[digital
age]{.mark}**, brain hacking and the engineering of smart phones have
[placed]{.mark} the [giant **technology firms**]{.mark} of Apple,
Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook [at the forefront of the]{.mark} new
[**weapons platform** of **NATO**]{.mark} and Wall Street.]{.underline}
This analysis is in three parts spelling out the rationale for the call
for all progressive forces to join together to concentrate their
energies in the dismantling of NATO.

**Security is an [unsustainable social fantasy]{.underline} that
justifies policy with [apocalyptic worst-case
thinking]{.underline}\-\--the impact is an endless,
[self-fulling]{.underline} cycle of enemy creation and [biopolitical
governance]{.underline}.**

[Security is]{.underline} about [the prevention of events **yet to
happen**]{.underline}; hence, [the future is]{.underline} -- or, rather,
possible futures are -- [the object of]{.underline}
[security]{.underline} practice. [Preventing means acting]{.underline}
here and [now on a threat]{.underline}, [which is then]{.underline}
'[the]{.underline} future [cause of a change in the
present']{.underline} (Massumi, 2005: 35). [Securing is about
**anticipating**]{.underline} (see Amoore, 2013; Anderson, 2010a, 2010b;
Aradau and Van Munster, 2012) 'a virtual cause, or quasicause' (Massumi,
2005: 35).7

According to Ulrich Beck (\[1986\] 1992), among the characteristic
elements of modern society is the emergence of 'risk' and its management
as a central governmental practice.8 Risk is about the quantification of
the future, and particularly future dangers, in terms of probability
(see Aradau and Van Munster, 2012: 99--100). The 'balance' between
prevention/anticipation and other dimensions becomes central to security
thinking at this juncture. A self-perceived risk society shifts the
focus from the 'event' -- and reactions to it -- to the management of
potential threats, which need to be continuously assessed and
anticipated. Practices based on risk management are about calculating
the trade-off between probability and the impact of a certain event. In
this framework, securitization is a cost--benefit curve: The more we
invest, the more we increase security, at the same time curtailing other
dimensions. When the added cost of increasing securitization becomes
bigger than the marginal gain (in terms of increased security), the
balance is found. Economic thinking of this kind has permeated more and
more fields of governance, from the 'securitization of life'
(LoboGuerrero, 2014) to conceptualizations of crime control (Foucault,
\[2004\] 2007: 4--5; see also Becker, 1974).

In line with the hegemonic standing of the individual in Western
Enlightenment ideas (Mignolo, 2009; Mouffe, 2008; Panikkar, 1982),
individual rights are placed right at the center of the
conceptualization of the balance. This is particularly evident in the
way in which the United Nations (the quintessentially universalist
institution) envisages security, more recently in the paradigm of human
security (for an overview, see Smith, 2005: 51--55):

We recognize that all individuals, in particular vulnerable people, are
entitled to freedom from fear and freedom from want, with an equal
opportunity to enjoy all their rights and fully develop their human
potential. To this end, we commit ourselves to discussing and defining
the notion of human security. (United Nations, 2005: §143)

The human security paradigm constructs a liberal individual as its
subject (see Robinson, 2016; Shepherd, 2008) and, in stressing the
interrelatedness of the 'human elements of security, rights and
development' (United Nations Human Security Unit, 2009: 6), it is
concerned about 'strik\[ing\] a balance among humanitarian, political,
military, human rights and development strategies' (Commission on Human
Security, 2003: 28; see also Panikkar, 1982: 83). Another example of the
balancing of rights, and its paradoxes, is the deployment of CCTV
systems as preventative means, a field where most regulations are
concerned with striking a balance of 'proportionality' between the
(alleged) increase of personal safety9 and the loss of privacy.10

In short, mainstream logics of security, centered on Western conceptions
of individual human rights, seek the correct balance between security
and other rights. I stress the centrality of Enlightenment conceptions
because these make the nature of contemporary security logics evident.
Lacanian planning theory (e.g. Allmendinger and Gunder, 2005; Gunder,
2003) has discussed how modernist planning -- which is rooted in
Enlightenment ideas and health and social order concerns -- is permeated
by a desire for security and certainty. It follows that the fantasy of
security is central to modern Western thinking -- as is a permanent
state of unfulfillment:

Much of [what we perceive of as **social reality is**]{.underline}
[actually a **culturally constructed**]{.underline} [set of
**fantasies**]{.underline} [that seek to provide a sense of
**completeness**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} **[ontological
wholeness]{.underline}**, [that we all desire, but is **never** actually
**achieved**]{.underline}. (Gunder, 2003: 293)

[Anderson]{.underline} (2010b: 229) has [referred to the coexistence of
the fantasy of **security**]{.underline} [with the
**impossibility**]{.underline} [of securing as the '**radical ambiguity
of security'**]{.underline}. Because '[living bodies can **never be
completely protected'**]{.underline} (Lorey, \[2012\] 2015: 20),
[securing is a never completed task]{.underline}. [Since there **is
always another potential threat, another virtual cause of
disruption**]{.underline}, [more **security calls** for **more
security**]{.underline}, [in an **unstoppable circuit**]{.underline}.
[In psychosocial terms]{.underline}, [these logics are typical of
relations of **control**]{.underline}, [based on the
assumption]{.underline} [that the **other**]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [always **inclined** to]{.underline}
**[transgression]{.underline}** [and should thus
**relentlessly**]{.underline} [prove their **innocence**]{.underline}
(Carli and Paniccia, 2003: 212--225). The idea of 'balancing' between an
insatiable right, security, and other rights seems quite problematic: a
'myth' (Neocleous, 2007) crucial to the construction of the liberal
order. Security may never be achieved, but it is always worth trying
harder, as long as endangered individuals exist, as summarized by two
powerful statesmen:

We will chase terrorists everywhere. If in an airport, then in the
airport. So if we find them in the toilet, excuse me, we'll rub them out
in the outhouse. And that's it, case closed. (Vladimir Putin, cited in
Oliphant, 2015, emphasis added)

I want to put all the nation's resources into protecting our citizens. .
. . We will eradicate terrorism because we are attached to freedom.
(François Hollande, cited in Horobin et al., 2015, emphasis added)

For Putin and Hollande, [security **only makes sense**]{.underline} [as
a good that institutions must pursue in its **purest
form**]{.underline}: **[absolute security]{.underline}**. [These
formulations may be **hyperbolic**]{.underline}, [but their underlying
logic is **not** structurally **different**]{.underline} [from that at
the core of mainstream **Western**/liberal **understandings** of
security]{.underline} -- for instance, [the UN's notion of human
security]{.underline} (see also Christian Borch's \[2015: 95--119\]
[discussion of the **totalitarian biopolitical character**]{.underline}
[of crime prevention]{.underline}). [And though all these understandings
of security involve different ideas about what might be the correct
balance between security and rights, they are **all concerned** with
**striking it**]{.underline}. [Inevitably, **freedom** and **security**
end up **converging**]{.underline} -- [with the **latter trumping the
former**]{.underline} -- as evident in this excerpt from an interview
with Italian former center--left minister of the interior Marco Minniti:

[Security is freedom]{.underline}: It is evident that there cannot be an
idea of security without guaranteeing individual freedom; and at the
same time, [there is no]{.underline} true [freedom if everyday safety is
not guaranteed]{.underline}. (cited in Giannini, 2017, emphasis added)11

[These contradictions]{.underline} [are taking on an even more
pronounced scale]{.underline} [amid recent transformations of the ways
in which futures are conceptualized in security practice]{.underline}.
More and more, [so-called **low-probability, high-impact
events**]{.underline}, [along with a focus on **possibility in spite of
probability**]{.underline}, [have become **central** to **security
logics**]{.underline} (Amoore, 2013; Anderson, 2010a, 2010b). [Terrorism
provides possibly the most evident example of this trend]{.underline}:
[In the West, being the victim of a **terror**]{.underline} [attack is
an event with an extremely **low probability**]{.underline},12 [and yet
compare this with the amount of **political discourse**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} governmental [resources concerned with
**terrorism**]{.underline} -- [is the late '**risk
society'**]{.underline} [concerned with actually **measurable risks
after all**]{.underline}?13 [While attention to low-probability,
high-impact events increases, the **focus shifts** toward]{.underline}
the **[management]{.underline}** [of **all behaviors**]{.underline} [and
bodies that are considered to be **out of place**]{.underline} (Aradau
and Van Munster, 2012; Borch, 2015). [Critical thinkers have therefore
argued that the **logics** of **terrorism**]{.underline}
**[preparedness]{.underline}** [have become the **central**
discursive]{.underline} [engine in global **trends** toward the
normalization of **states** of '**emergency'**]{.underline} and
'**[exception']{.underline}** (Adey et al., 2015; Agamben, 2003, 2015).
Needless to say, there are powerful interests behind the securitization
in the name of terrorism and other threats -- critical urban studies,
for instance, has shown how terrorism is the central discursive engine
in the attack late capitalism has launched against democracy (see, for
example, Rossi and Vanolo, \[2010\] 2012).

And yet, if large majorities -- especially in the Western world, but
increasingly so in the global South -- support the allocation of so many
resources to, along with the constraining of their own rights in the
name of, [the fight against **phenomena**]{.underline} [with such
**low**]{.underline} **[actual 'impact']{.underline}**, [this could also
be due to the fact that the **fantasy** of]{.underline}
**[security]{.underline}** [seems **more real than it has ever
been**]{.underline}. After all, never in the history of mankind have
there been societies safer than those of the contemporary West (Bauman,
2005). Of course, this is not valid for everyone. Security is
distributed very unevenly internally within societies, along geographic,
class, ethnic/racial, gender, and other divides, but most attention is
devoted to fighting (allegedly, see Melossi, 2003) external threats.

#### Vote negative in favor of a [ruthless]{.underline} critique of securitization -- capital has colluded with industry to produce a field of expertism designed to maintain global militarism -- if their scholarship is suspect you should refuse to evaluate the consequences of the plan

**Neocleous, 18** -- Professor of the Critique of Political Economy at
Brunel University. (Mark Neocleous, "The bleak rituals of progress; or,
if somebody offers you a socially responsible innovation in security,
just say no," *Socially Responsible Innovation in Security*, Routledge,
2018, pg. 129-139)//ILake-MO

Yet to organize and mobilize in the name of socially responsible
innovation in security is nonetheless [to organize and **mobilize** in
the name of **security**.]{.underline} Moreover, as I have been trying
to suggest in the first half of this chapter, [it is likewise to
**mobilize** in the name of **capital**. What 'socially **responsible**
innovation in **security'** gives us, then, is little more than yet
another way of **participating** in the logic of
**security**.]{.underline} Adopting a term straight out of the discourse
of capital ('innovation'), and adding to it one of the key terms of
corporate neoliberal power (namely 'corporate social responsibility'),
socially responsible innovations in security appear to be little more
than new ways of rendering the social over to the powers of state and
capital.

One might extend this observation by pointing out that although it is
generally assumed that the whole point of innovation is that it
surprises -- 'the greater the surprise, the more innovative the idea'
(Nowotny, 2008, p. 103) -- rarely is anything actually genuinely
surprising offered in socially responsible innovations in security.
Quite the opposite, in fact: [accepting entirely the logic of
**security**, all such **innovations** do is try and **moderate** this
logic by somehow recognizing 'privacy' or 'liberty', or by not being too
**discriminatory** or exclusionary,]{.underline} or by being less under
the corporate powers within the security industry. [Ultimately, the
least surprising thing of all happens: **security** still **wins**.
Worse, security wins by having the whole of the social offered up to it,
and offered up to it by the new 'socially progressive'
advisors]{.underline} to Princes, those whose political vision commits
us to what we are told must be our fate: one security experience after
another, one security scare after another, one recovery from each
security scare after another, one security innovation after another.

[The more dominant a concept becomes, the more **unimaginable** the
means by which those living under its spell might break that
**domination**.]{.underline} In the case of security, [the only way to
imagine breaking its domination is to begin with its **ruthless
critique**. To advocate socially responsible innovation in **security**
is to advocate **conformity** rather than critique.]{.underline} If
somebody offers you a socially responsible innovation in security, just
say no.

[Securitizations not only have powerful effects on immediate policy
responses to threats, but also have lasting political and social
implications]{.underline}. Extending from present securitization theory,
this paper has demonstrated that [a successful securitization
fundamentally alters the baseline of normative politics.]{.underline} By
discursively constructing an 'Other' that is existentially threatening
to the Self, securitizations elevate certain core values (those seen as
existentially threatened) while simultaneously subducting others. [In so
doing, securitizations create discursive frameworks through which the
distortion, perversion or abrogation of non-core values becomes
acceptable, since these transgressions are taken in the name of
protecting the core, constitutive values of the political body.
Furthermore, this 'new normal' is quite resilient, informing the
calculus of policy makers long after the securitizing speech act first
took place, although the new framework is never ossified to the point of
being irreversible.]{.underline}

This extended framework holds useful insights for policy-makers and
practitioners[. It suggests that policy-makers can use existing
securitizations to legitimize certain actions, or, alternatively, that
they can engage in a securitizing speech act to create long-term
acceptance for a broad goal.]{.underline} Conversely, acknowledging the
lasting political and social impacts of a successful securitization
allows practitioners to first identify and then counteract a
securitizing discourse. [In effect, noting the role of securitization on
the normative framework of politics allows politicians and security
practitioners to engage in strategic desecuritizations, ultimately
removing issues from the realm of security altogether.]{.underline}

[Since then, strategic communicative actions that are intended to
influence, mislead and confuse foreign populations have assumed a
**central position** in global debates about politics and foreign
policy. Given the impact of such actions on elections, polarization and
crisis management, it was natural for the rhetoric about these actions
to assume such a central position]{.underline}(Bradshaw, Howard, 2018).
However, over time, popular buzzwords like
'disinformation/misinformation', 'fake news', and 'information
operations' have proliferated in global political mainstream discourse
and assumed an accusatory nature worldwide as more leaders, diplomats,
and politicians have begun using them to discredit and delegitimize
their political opponents. [This dynamic was later conceptualized as
'discursive deflection']{.underline} (Ross, Rivers, 2018; Smith, 2019)
[and became acutely visible in the foreign policy domain, as more
countries have begun securitizing the concepts 'fake news',
'disinformation', and 'information warfare' to similarly discredit, and
delegitimize rival countries]{.underline}(Baum, Potter, 2019). Broadly
speaking, ['discursive-deflection' is the strategy of discrediting
competitors and rivals by portraying oneself as the sole source of
truth.]{.underline} While the domestic political use of these terms is
well-studied, we are still somewhat in the dark with regard to why
countries choose to securitize these terms and what happens in their
interactions with other countries when they do so.

The foreign policy use of such terms predates the 2016 US elections and
proliferated after the Russian military involvement in Crimea and Donbas
(Khaldarova, Pantti, 2016). The primary reason for this contextual
proliferation was the Russian decision to deny the initial stages of its
involvement in Ukraine and its broader strategy of distracting and
dividing Western attention over Russian military operations (Mejias,
Vokuev, 2017). [There is still a debate over whether it was really
Russian information operations that had derailed NATO response in
Ukraine, or if disinformation discourses are employed in order to shift
the blame over to Russia at a time when NATO was already divided over
its commitment to Ukraine]{.underline} (Lysenko, Brooks, 2018). [While
there is robust evidence of Russian information operations in Ukraine
and its role in spreading disinformation in NATO countries, sustained
NATO apathy towards rising Russian military influence in the Black Sea
after 2014 and Syria after 2015 support the latter claim.]{.underline}

Critics of Western disinformation discourses for example, argue that
such discourses have turned into 'floating (or empty) signifiers', that
have no specific or agreed-upon meaning (Farkas, Schou, 2018). In that
vein, blaming others for engaging in disinformation often distracts
attention away from a mistake or failed policy enacted by the blamer
(Monsees, 2020). In this case[, critics argue that Western discourses on
disinformation are intended to distract attention away from NATO or EU
divisions, or more domesticlevel polarization dynamics, by creating a
unique empty signifier (disinformation) that is employed as a rallying
rhetoric that bolsters the significance of external threats (Mas-Manchón
et al., 2021). This way, disinformation and its associated terms like
misinformation, fake news and information war get securitized, receiving
disproportionate levels of attention in the policy domain]{.underline}.
In this context, [disinformation and its associated terms are used to
**exaggerate** an existing threat and create a **rallying discourse**
that would channel the attention of the divided Western nations away
from their internal disagreements, and towards an **inflated external
threat**.]{.underline} Some scholars go even further, arguing that
disinformation is being securitized in the West (especially in NATO) to
the extent the 'war on terror' was securitized through the 2000s
(Lanoszka, 2019). In this line, disinformation is alleged to have become
a new strategic glue that would help Western nations pool in their
increasingly diverging interests and resources into a common cause
(Baumann, 2020).

Securitization of disinformation in domestic politics is relatively
well-studied (Freelon, Wells, 2020; Neo, 2021). Although these terms
have entered into mainstream debate after the 2016 US elections, [former
President Donald Trump too, had **securitized fake news** to
**delegitimize his opponents** by constructing rival disinformation as a
national security problem, indirectly attributable to China]{.underline}
(Polletta, Callahan, 2019). [Following the tornado of accusations in the
US, political actors in **Britain**, **France**, **Italy**, **South
Africa**, **Kenya** and others have begun blaming each other for
engaging in organized disinformation]{.underline} (Maweu, 2019;
Saurwein, Spencer-Smith, 2020[). Even in Sweden, there is empirical
evidence that suggests accusing journalists of spreading fake news
results in **self-censorship** of such outlets]{.underline} (Bennett,
Livingston, 2018). [There are further cases of evidence supporting the
claim that elite-level discourses on disinformation have **a direct
effect** on how the wider society **perceives information** and facts in
general, creating **a measurable effect** on **public trust** towards
such facts and information]{.underline} (Van Duyn, Collier, 2019). [In
Singapore for example, delegitimizing rival parties and news outlets
through disinformation discourse is considered 'acceptable', as part of
the state's duty to discipline the opposition and its political actors
(Tan, 2020). Similar trends emerging in democracies and authoritarian
countries alike, such as in Austria, Australia, Poland, Russia, and
South Africa, demonstrate the universality of instrumentalizing
disinformation discourse as a political delegitimization
tactic]{.underline} (Kurowska, Reshetnikov, 2018; Tandoc et al., 2018).

#### Language mobilizes proportionate policy action.

[One of the most important building blocks in securitization is the
speech act,]{.underline} which is theorized by Jane Austin (1962) in her
book How to Do Things with Words. [Austin argues that the speech act is
neither true nor false; it is a performed action]{.underline}, like when
you say, "I bet" you actually "act", or when you say, "I do" in a
marriage, you actually "perform" something and your status changes, and
even when you "declare war" you perform an act and you are in the state
of war. [In such cases there is no further action needed to finish these
acts, they are final. Security is also a communicative act (Waever
1995), which affects the audience and drives them to act accordingly.
Speech act is equated to action, not only communication (Austin 1962;
Waever 1995; Buzan et al. 1998; Booth 2007), and this is why, by
labeling an issue as a "security" issue, one preforms an
act]{.underline}, such as naming a baby, naming a ship, getting married,
or declaring a war. [This case only updates the "speech act" into the
"security speech act", where a political significance and an existential
importance are given to the issue that is labeled as
"security"]{.underline} (Waever 1995). When labeling an issue as a
security issue, usually the word "security" is uttered. But that is not
always a must, as words such as "defense, offense, or attack" have a
similar effect as the word "security" (Waever 1995; Buzan et al. 1998).
[In politics, a security labeled issue is equated to existence; this is
why it becomes a priority policy for the government and the
people.]{.underline} When an issue is profiled as a security issue then
the action has already happened. There is no true or false, it
immediately becomes a security issue, which is later discussed by the
audience to issue the legitimacy to use the extraordinary means, that
would not be used in normal circumstances, just to ensure the wellbeing
of the securitized issue.

[Language is always very important in politics, but especially in
constituting a threat and a security atmosphere, language becomes even
more important. Bourdieu (1999: 170) argues that there is a magical
symbolic power of words, as they make people see and believe a
particular vision of the world and make them act and mobilize in that
world, as almost an equivalent of force]{.underline}. German
philosopher, Jurgen Habermas (1984: 289), explains the relation between
language and action as follows: "to say something, to act in saying
something, to bring about something through acting in saying something".

#### Securitized discourse directly affects NATO policymaking.

Following the Russian meddling in the 2016 US elections, disinformation
and fake news became popular terms to help generate domestic awareness
against foreign information operations globally. Today, [a large number
of politicians, diplomats and civil society leaders identify
disinformation and fake news as a primary problem in both domestic and
foreign policy contexts]{.underline}. But how do security institutions
define disinformation and fake news in foreign and security policy, and
how do their securitization strategies change over years? [This article
explores **238,452 tweets** from official NATO and affiliated accounts,
and more than 2,000 NATO **texts**, **news**, **statements**, and
**publications** using computational methods since January 2014 and
presents an unsupervised structural topic model (stm)
analysis]{.underline} to explore the main thematic and discursive
contexts of these texts. [The study finds that NATO's threat discourse
and securitization strategies are **heavily influenced** by US
**political lexicon** and discovers that word choices change based on
their likelihood of **mobilizing alliance resources** and
**cohesion**]{.underline}. [In addition, the study finds that NATO's
recent **disinformation agenda** is in fact a continuity of NATO's
long-standing Russia-focused **securitization discourse** and an attempt
to mobilize alliance attention on Baltic states and Poland to counter
Russia.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Research First

#### What and how we research is a [political activity]{.underline} that [shapes subjectivity]{.underline} -- even if debate is a game, as an educator you have an [ethical obligation]{.underline} to reject logics of securitization 

**Stavrianakis 6** -- Senior Lecturer in International Relations @
University of Sussex, Director of Teaching and Learning in the School of
Global Studies, PhD @ Bristol \[Anna, "Call to Arms: The University as a
Site of Militarised Capitalism and a Site of Struggle," Millennium:
Journal of International Studies, Vol 35, No 1, 12/1/2006, DKP\]

If universities are sites of both domination and contestation, [what
does this mean for research? Primarily, it means that it is a political
activity.]{.underline} That is, [what academics choose to
research]{.underline} (and what they put on their teaching syllabi) [is
intimately related to their worldviews and value systems.]{.underline}
As Max Weber argued, "all knowledge of cultural reality ... is always
knowledge from particular points of view."41 Issues that require and/or
receive academic investigation do not exist objectively but within a
frame of reference that constitutes them as a problem: "without the
investigator's evaluative ideas, there would be no principle of
selection of subject-matter and no meaningful knowledge of the concrete
reality."42 At present, it is only those arguments that challenge
mainstream values and ideas that are recognised as political: the
inherent political situatedness of mainstream arguments goes unnoticed
precisely because it is unremarkable.43 This applies as much to
scientists and engineers as it does to IR scholars. As documented above,
[the problems for which scientists and engineers seek solutions exist
within a framework that is significantly influenced by the needs of the
arms industry.]{.underline} [The problems that IR scholars seek to
analyse are influenced by the frameworks governing the
discipline]{.underline}, such as the ESRC's emphasis on priority areas
and demands for policy engagement. [This emphasis]{.underline}, in
addition to the principle of having to apply competitively for funding
to carry out research, a core academic duty, [serves to orient the
discipline]{.underline} in particular directions, [towards
the]{.underline} instrumentalisation and [commercialisation of academic
research. **Even those who seek to "play the game"**]{.underline}
further entrench the principle of external funding and **[reproduce the
discourse of policy relevance in order to win resources to conduct their
own, critical research.]{.underline}**

Conducting policy-relevant research is not necessarily antithetical to
challenging oppression: targeted [interventions in the policy
process]{.underline} can be effective, but [**run the significant risk
of co-option.** Being accepted as policy relevant requires that one use
the]{.underline} same vocabulary and conceptual [language as those
making or implementing policy, and this generally requires acceptance of
the parameters within which a policy is framed. **Even those who seek to
use this vocabulary for strategic gain have to negotiate the hurdles of
co-option and neutralisation. Policy relevance is often reduced to
improving the processes through which a policy is implemented; yet such
an approach sidelines debate about the values and goals that inform
policy.** It is difficult for those who seek to challenge oppression
through policy engagement to have an impact on value
choices]{.underline}, however. **[They are unlikely to have access to or
credibility with elite actors because their critical stance
disadvantages them in the networking that is intrinsic to
academia]{.underline}** (as in any other profession).

[If we accept]{.underline} that [research is]{.underline} a
[political]{.underline} activity, how are we to proceed? [Two potential
strategies spring to mind. One is based on]{.underline} Max Weber's
dictum that "the prophet and the demagogue do not belong on the academic
platform."44 Academics have a socially privileged role that should not
be abused by advancing political positions that carry extra weight
because of the authority invested in the speaker. For Weber, objectivity
is not the same as moral indifference, but the social position of
academic is not one for advancing political views because we cannot
choose rationally between values: that choice is "a matter of faith"
rather than empirical fact.45 The Weberian concept of [value
neutrality]{.underline} refers to academics' responsibility to keep the
scientific discussion of facts separate from the evaluation of them,
having accepted that the choice of what to study is value-driven. [The
task of an academic, in this view, is to engage in technical criticism
and value clarification.]{.underline}46 [This serves to identify the
repercussions of particular courses of action and the value schema that
motivate them, but refrains from commenting on the validity of those
values.]{.underline}

[A second option is to **engage explicitly as an activist academic**,
making clear what one's political commitments are and **actively
choosing sides.**]{.underline}47 In this scenario, [academics explicitly
choose to research instances or structures of social
injustice]{.underline}, often conduct research with rather than on
particular subjects, [and use their research to inform]{.underline}
campaigning and [protest.]{.underline} This is neither necessarily
biased research nor the production of propaganda (although of course,
like any research, it can be). **[The activist academic is explicit
about]{.underline}** the values **[motivating]{.underline}** her/his
**[research]{.underline}** -- and as argued earlier, value choice is
intrinsic to all research, whether it is acknowledged or not -- **[and
seeks to connect academic practice to activism]{.underline}**, learning
from and contributing to activist struggles. **[Engaging
with]{.underline}** campaigners [**and social movements** has the dual
effect of putting more pressure on government to change its policies and
contributing to the wider democratisation of social life through the
sharing of skills and knowledge among activists and
academics]{.underline}. Both Weberian and activist strategies share an
acceptance of the political nature of all research, and that **[there is
no view from nowhere]{.underline}**, but [the]{.underline} latter
[strategy actively tries to use research to challenge
oppression]{.underline}. Those following a Weberian strategy may well
undertake research that is critical of the status quo, but they do not
explicitly ally themselves with what they believe to be progressive
social forces.

My own understanding of activist academic research retains a belief that
[scholarship is a different social activity from campaigning. While both
are politically situated]{.underline} and motivated, [the primary aim of
campaigning is to generate change, while the primary aim of scholarship
is to generate truth]{.underline} (which can only ever be situated and
partial), a process in which scholars have a duty to deal explicitly
with 'inconvenient' facts.48 However, scholarship and campaigning can be
mutually reinforcing, through a process of translation "that allows for
mutual intelligibility among the experiences of the world" that aims to
"identify and reinforce what is common in the diversity of
counter-hegemonic drive."49 One of the challenges for activist academics
is traversing the boundaries between academia and activism.50 For
academics of this persuasion, the task is to ensure that there is
"neither too much reflection on too little experience, which is armchair
theorizing, nor too little reflection on too much experience, which is
mere activism."51 Of course, [there are risks associated with activist
research, including the loss of access to the very institutions and
actors that need to be examined, because of one's reputation as an
activist or lack of contacts within elite circles. This poses difficult
questions]{.underline} for activist researchers **[and can be a
disciplining process]{.underline}**, [requiring them to weigh up the
benefits]{.underline} to be gained [from contributing to social struggle
against their role as a scholar in exploring the social
world.]{.underline} Given that activist academics' contribution to
social struggle is based on their scholarship, this is a significant
risk.

As a brief illustration of how academic strategies play out in practice,
my own research explores non-governmental organisation (NGO) activity in
relation to UK involvement in the arms trade through the lens of debates
about global civil society.52 It assesses the government's stated policy
against its export practice, introducing "inconvenient facts" regarding
the relationship between arms capital and the UK state and role of
coercion in the development of capitalism. The leap to an explicitly
activist agenda comes through engagement with the issue of change in UK
arms export policy and my involvement with anti-arms trade campaigners.
I am indebted to campaigners and NGO workers, many of whom have
conducted painstaking research into the arms trade and its effects. On
the basis of the research I have done -- using scholarly methods such as
documentary analysis and interviews53 -- I am in a position to
contribute to activist debates and strategy, which I have done
predominantly through involvement with CAAT at the local and national
level. A second aspect of my research explores the widespread image of
NGOs and campaign groups as progressive agents of global civil society.
[I am interested interrogating the dominant liberal narratives of a
globalising emancipatory and non-violent sphere separate from the state
and market,]{.underline} and NGO activity on the UK arms trade is a rich
case study for this. This research has implications for campaigning but
may not be directly relevant for it[. I do not conduct my research for
arms campaigners but I contribute where I can; my research agenda is not
defined by what is campaignable. This is in line with my understanding
of scholarship and campaigning as distinct social
activities.]{.underline}

A key issue for critical scholars is strategy: do they use the main
claim to legitimacy that scholars have, that of disinterested inquiry,
and introduce "inconvenient facts" into their research; or do they get
involved with the individuals and groups struggling against the
oppression they document and analyse? Significant numbers of academics
are involved in advising political actors: the disagreement comes over
whose politics should be supported. Academia prides itself on its
independence and the impartiality of research, a position promoted by
key funding bodies.54 If one accepts that "good research is not just
books and academic papers, but is also the creative action of people to
address matters that are important to them,"55 is one at risk of a
conflict of interest? In an activist conception of scholarship it is
acceptable to be involved with groups and/or individuals one is
researching. This rests on an acknowledgement that [there are forces of
domination in society: some social forces are much better resourced and
more widely ideologically acceptable]{.underline}, so being involved
with them does not look like a conflict of interest. [Activist academic
research challenges this and self-consciously allies itself with groups
and individuals struggling against oppression in an attempt to bolster
forces of resistance.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--!\-\--Psychic Violence

#### Securitization within educational spaces causes psychic violence --- that outweighs.

**Stern 18** -- Professor of Education in the School of Psychological
and Social Sciences at York St. John University

Julien Stern, "The Politics of Schooling," A Philosophy of Schooling,
2-20-2018, https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-71571-1_9

[Those who are in constant fear of death, therefore, necessarily fear
life]{.underline}. The idea of fearing life is well captured by the poet
Larkin, who said '\[l\]ife is first boredom, then fear' (Larkin 1988, p
153). The psychologist Erikson presents the other side of this: 'healthy
children will not fear life if their elders have integrity enough not to
fear death' (Erikson from Childhood and Society, quoted in Arthur 1990,
p 150). Gandhi says it even more poetically: '\[t\]hose who defy death
are free from all fear' (Gandhi 1951, p 248). [Passing on fear across
the generations---or avoiding passing on fear---this is a **choice made
within schools**]{.underline}. So Hobbes feared death and used reason to
avoid it as long as he could. Macmurray overcame his fear of death, and
therefore---he believed---overcame his fear of life. Macmurray's account
of overcoming fear by facing it is an important dimension of his
philosophy, and it is in the application to school communities of
Macmurray's approaches to fear that is, I believe, of considerable
value. [Macmurray said that fear haunts all forms of community---family,
friends, religious communities, and schools]{.underline}:

**[Fear freezes the spontaneity of life]{.underline}**. [The more fear
there is in us, the less alive we are. Fear accomplishes this
destruction of life by turning us in upon ourselves and so isolating us
from the world outside us. That sense of individual isolation which is
so common in the modern world, which is often called 'individualism', is
one of the inevitable expressions of fear.]{.underline} (Macmurray 1992,
p 32)

[This form of 'individualism', expressed as 'egocentricity' and
'selfishness' leads to a 'life which is fear-determined', he says, and
'fundamentally on the defensive']{.underline} (Macmurray 1992, p 33).
[Such a life 'is permeated by the feeling of being alone in a hostile
world']{.underline} (Macmurray 1992, p 33): this might be a description
of Hobbes' 'state of nature', and it has a great deal in common with
Macpherson's account of Hobbes' philosophy, centred on its 'possessive
individualism' (Macpherson 1962). Macmurray and Hobbes, therefore, agree
that [fear leads to **individualism** which in turn leads to
defensiveness and misery]{.underline}. Where they differ is in the
possibility of 'escape' from fear. Hobbes understands the only way out
of a nasty, brutish, short life is by the creation of a greater
fear---that of government by the Leviathan. Life may remain somewhat
nasty, but it will be longer, as people will no longer attempt to kill
each other, as they will all fear punishment by the government. For
Hobbes, this is not a mere theory: he described himself as living in
fear, being born with fear as his inseparable twin. [Macmurray, in
contrast, found escape from the fear of death precisely in recognising
that death was inevitable. The purpose of government was not to create
enough fear to stop people from killing each other]{.underline}. It was
to enable friendship in community to flourish.

[Political systems **at any scale** can be founded, as Hobbes describes
it, primarily on a (rational) fear or they can be founded, as Macmurray
describes it, primarily on friendship]{.underline}---which does not
'depend upon pure reason' (Macmurray 1946c, p 8). Sitting alongside
Hobbes are many other social contract theorists. Such [theories are
often driven by fear]{.underline}. Even Rawls (1972) bases his
justice-oriented political theory on a social contract to be agreed by
people sitting behind a 'veil of ignorance', assuming that the veil
ensures they would fear the consequences of a system in which some are
unfairly treated. It is not enough that the system should be fair: what
is needed is ignorance of whether you are to benefit from or be harmed
by the unfair system, to motivate you to agree to a fair system. Sitting
alongside Macmurray are those who base politics on positive
relationships. As described in Chap. 2, Macmurray and Aristotle, for
example, both put friendship at the heart of their politics. Aristotle
goes as far as to say that 'in a tyranny there is little or no
friendship' (Aristotle 1976, p 278, quoted in Chap. 6).

[Schools can be based on fear---fear of punishment, fear of failure,
fear of bullying---**just as much as nations** can be based on fear. Few
explicitly recommend fear as a motivator in school, but occasionally a
fear-driven educational philosophy is revealed.]{.underline} The UK
secretary of state for education, John Patten, complained of lessening
expectation of eternal damnation amongst young people. He said that 'the
loss of that fear has meant a critical motive has been lost to young
people when they decide whether to try to be good citizens or criminals'
(Macleod 1992). Although coverage of his comments clearly related them
to his (Catholic) religious beliefs, Ball says that the principles of
Patten and other 'new right' thinkers in the educational politics of the
1980s and 1990s 'could trace its philosophy back to Hobbes' (Ball 1994,
p 29). [Other education writers describe---in negative terms---the use
of fear in schools, and the need to reduce its use. Harber (2002, 2004)
writes of 'schooling as violence', including both **physical** and
**psychological** violence, and describes how 'authoritarianism in
schools and classrooms' creates an '**association of pain** and fear
with learning']{.underline} (Harber 2002, p 11), whilst Chater writes of
'education as violence to the spirit' (in Ota and Chater 2007, Chap. 7).
Failure in school is seen by Holt as generated by fear: fear of
embarrassment, fear of failure, fear, perhaps, even of success (Holt
1964), and Barth describes the 'biggest problem besetting schools' as
the 'primitive quality of human relationships', which leads to 'children
and adults ... frequently behave\[ing\] like infants, complying with
authority from fear or dependence' (Barth 1990, p 36). More positively,
Ayers describes a 'good school' as 'fearless' (Ayers 2004, p 39), and
Noddings, noting how ['schools have often induced fear, boredom,
subjugation and feelings of inadequacy', describes how 'good education'
will take place in caring institutions]{.underline} (Noddings, in Lees
and Noddings 2016, p 1). And Fielding describes the headteacher Alex
Bloom, working in London in the 1940s and 1950s, who believed that ['at
the root of much bad education, in both its broad and narrow senses, is
the utilisation of fear, either as a motivating device for good
behaviour or as a deterrence for its opposite', noting that 'fear
enslaves and **inhibits** ... \[and\] **destroys the
personality'**]{.underline}, in contrast to Bloom's view of
education---including his work as a headteacher---which 'implies growth
... of the whole personality' (Fielding, quoting Bloom, in Burke and
Jones 2014, p 89).

[The role of fear in politics---incorporating the politics of
schooling---is complex. It is the **dominance of fear** that is objected
to by Noddings, Ayers, Bloom, or Harber, but there must be room for some
risk or stress that might induce some fear. Gill (2007) writes of an
increasingly **'risk-averse' society** that attempts to make children
wholly safe: as dangerous, he says, to try to avoid fear at all costs as
it is to be dominated by fear. In fact, Gill suggests that adult
fears---fears of litigation, of being sued---are the **source of a
risk-averse culture** that tries to abolish all fear]{.underline}. Even
friendship or love, the positive relationship that is central to the
politics of both Macmurray and Aristotle, has an element of risk and
fear. Facer writes of 'the self as democratic agent' in schools as
implying 'the simultaneous fear and confidence engendered in the
recognition of dependence upon others', with friendship described as
'that unique relation of fear and trust' (Facer, in Lees and Noddings
2016, p 74). [It is the **misuse of fear** as the basis for all politics
that **is dangerous**. Fear and love, according to Costello's biography
of Macmurray, are 'the two founding motives in human beings', and fear
can have 'value' but is 'misuse\[d\] and abuse\[d\] ... in
totalitarianism']{.underline} (Costello 2002b, p 290). Macmurray's work
has echoes in the social psychology of Mitscherlich. Living through
Germany in the 1930s, and attending some of the Nuremburg trials in his
professional capacity as a psychologist (Mitscherlich and Mielke 1949),
he used his understanding of totalitarianism to analyse post-war
Germany. Authority had been so misused before and during the war that
survivors were unable to mourn (Mitscherlich and Mitscherlich 1975) and
became a 'fatherless society' (Mitscherlich 1993). It is not that
Germans had 'got over' the experience of the years of totalitarianism.
They had rejected mourning and rejected authority altogether as both
were too uncomfortable. Fearing their own history, Germans were unable
to rebel against authority, leading to what is described as a 'fraternal
society' (Mitscherlich and Mitscherlich 1975, p 305, described by Bly as
the 'sibling society', in Mitscherlich 1993, p xvii). Education was
tightly controlled in totalitarian Germany, but this meant education
failed. '\[E\]ducation can never be complete' as '\[a\]n educated man
... \[is\] one who has retained his youthful receptiveness to the new
and the unknown', he says, so '\[d\]ogmatic certainty is the end of
education': '\[t\]he educated philistine is as uneducated as the
ignoramus' (Mitscherlich 1993, p 13--14). [The politics of schooling
reflects---and contributes to---**wider politics**. Fear-driven
politics, like fear-driven schooling, typically **divides people
encouraging individualism** and competitiveness and works against both
friendship and self-realisation. 'The world cannot be saved by the
exercise of power', Macmurray says, as '\[t\]o use power ... is to
appeal to fear: it is to make another afraid to refuse obedience to your
command' (Macmurray 1995, p 77). He continues, saying that '\[t\]he
State acts through fear to **maintain the common life** of a society'
(Macmurray 1995, p 78) whereas it is left to communities---family,
religion, schools---to 'act through love to maintain and to create a
community' (Macmurray 1995, p 78). That is why Macmurray's approach to
fear---his way of tackling Hobbes' twin---is so radical and so
significant. It is also the basis of his qualified
optimism.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--!\-\--Education

#### Understanding subjectivity is a prerequisite to true education.

**Zambernardi 16** -- Assistant Professor of Political and Social
Science at University of Bologna

What, then, is the role of theory for practitioners? [Rather than
prescribe policies, IR scholarship should have a pedagogical role; it
should help decision-makers to familiarize themselves with the complex
matter of politics]{.underline}. [It should be an instrument of
self-education meant to widen policymakers' mental
horizons.]{.underline} IR should play the role that Clausewitz assigned
to theory in the education of the military commander:

[Theory should be study, not doctrine\.... It is an analytical
investigation leading to a close acquaintance with the subject; applied
to experience \... it leads to thorough familiarity with
it]{.underline}. The closer it comes to that goal, the more it proceeds
from the objective form of a science to a subjective form of a skill,
the more effective it will prove in areas where the nature of the case
admits no arbiter but talent\.... [Theory is meant to educate the mind
of the future commander, or, more accurately, to guide him in his
self-education, not to accompany him to the battlefield]{.underline}.
(Clausewitz, 1976: 141)

[Theoretical knowledge is an instrument for intellectual development,
not a substitute for political judgement]{.underline}. Thus,
policymakers, while practitioners, should also be students of politics,
and, paraphrasing William Butler, no broad line of demarcation should be
drawn between the practitioner and the thinking man.14 IR theorists, on
their part, should there- fore be reminded about the beginnings of [US
political science, which was born not primarily as a technique for
direct application, but as a critical and formative discipline meant to
**educate political leaders and citizens (**]{.underline}Crick, 1959:
19--36).15

More may be better: The political importance of theoretical pluralism

The second function of IR refers to its influence on those general ideas
that shape the discussion on foreign policy decisions. In particular,
[even if scholarship is not supposed to guide the conduct of foreign
affairs directly, it can still perform the role that Collingridge and
Reeve]{.underline} (1986), [in their analysis of the role of experts in
policymaking, labelled as 'ironic.' Rather than provide solutions to
problems, IR helps policymakers to look at problems from different
angles, to question causal assumptions and to challenge simplistic
doctrines employed by practitioners in their foreign policy
conduct.]{.underline} [IR scholarship can contribute to policy and
public discussion on how to consider a specific issue, even when there
are no precise answers to offer]{.underline} (Wilson, 2000: 122).

### 2NC\-\--!\-\--Serial Policy Failure

Bruce Schneier, "Worst Case Thinking," Schneier Blog, 3-13-10,
http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/05/worst-case_thin.html

At a security conference recently, the moderator asked the panel of
distinguished cybersecurity leaders what their nightmare scenario was.
The answers were the predictable array of large-scale attacks: against
our communications infrastructure, against the power grid, against the
financial system, in combination with a physical attack. I didn\'t get
to give my answer until the afternoon, which was: \"My nightmare
scenario is that people keep talking about their nightmare scenarios.\"
[There\'s a certain blindness that comes from worst-case
thinking]{.underline}. An extension of the precautionary principle, [it
involves imagining the worst possible outcome and then acting as if it
were a certainty.]{.underline} [It substitutes imagination for thinking,
speculation for risk analysis, and fear for reason]{.underline}. [It
fosters powerlessness and vulnerability and magnifies social
paralysis]{.underline}. [And it makes us more vulnerable to the effects
of terrorism.]{.underline} [Worst-case thinking means generally bad
decision making]{.underline} for several reasons. First, [it\'s only
half of the cost-benefit equation]{.underline}. Every decision has costs
and benefits, risks and rewards. [By speculating about what can possibly
go wrong, and then acting as if that is likely to happen, worst-case
thinking focuses only on the extreme but improbable risks and does a
poor job at assessing outcomes]{.underline}**.** Second, [it\'s based on
flawed logic. It begs the question by assuming that a proponent of an
action must prove that the nightmare scenario is
impossible.]{.underline} Third, it [can be used to support any position
or its opposite. If we build a nuclear power plant, it could melt down.
If we don\'t build it, we will run short of power and society will
collapse into anarchy.]{.underline} If we allow flights near Iceland\'s
volcanic ash, planes will crash and people will die. If we don\'t,
organs won't arrive in time for transplant operations and people will
die[. If we don\'t invade Iraq, Saddam Hussein might use the nuclear
weapons he might have. If we do, we might destabilize the Middle
East]{.underline}, leading to widespread violence and death. Of course,
not all fears are equal. **[Those that we tend to exaggerate are more
easily justified by worst-case thinking]{.underline}**. So [terrorism
fears trump privacy fears, and almost everything else]{.underline};
technology is hard to understand and therefore scary; nuclear weapons
are worse than conventional weapons; our children need to be protected
at all costs; and annihilating the planet is bad. Basically, any fear
that would make a good movie plot is amenable to worst-case thinking.
Fourth and finally, [worst-case thinking validates ignorance. Instead of
focusing on what we know, it focuses on what we don\'t know]{.underline}
\-- and what we can imagine. Remember Defense Secretary Rumsfeld\'s
quote? \"Reports that say that something hasn\'t happened are always
interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are
things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is
to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also
unknown unknowns \-- the ones we don\'t know we don\'t know.\" And this:
\"the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\" **[Ignorance
isn\'t a cause for doubt; when you can fill that ignorance with
imagination, it can be a call to action]{.underline}**. Even worse, [it
can lead to hasty and dangerous acts]{.underline}. [You can\'t wait for
a smoking gun, so you act as if the gun is about to go off. Rather than
making us safer, worst-case thinking has the potential **to cause
dangerous escalation**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} new
[undercurrent]{.underline} in this [is]{.underline} that [our society no
longer has the ability to calculate probabilities]{.underline}**. [Risk
assessment is devalued]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} [Probabilistic
thinking is repudiated in favor of \"possibilistic
thinking]{.underline}\": Since we can\'t know what\'s likely to go
wrong, let\'s speculate about what can possibly go wrong. [Worst-case
thinking leads to bad decisions, bad systems design, and bad
security.]{.underline} And we all have direct experience with its
effects: airline security and the TSA, which we make fun of when we\'re
not appalled that they\'re harassing 93-year-old women or keeping first
graders off airplanes. You can\'t be too careful! Actually, you can. You
can refuse to fly because of the possibility of plane crashes. You can
lock your children in the house because of the possibility of child
predators. You can eschew all contact with people because of the
possibility of hurt. Steven Hawking wants to avoid trying to communicate
with aliens because they might be hostile; does he want to turn off all
the planet\'s television broadcasts because they\'re radiating into
space? It isn\'t hard to parody worst-case thinking, and at its extreme
it\'s a psychological condition. Frank [Furedi, a sociology professor at
the University of Kent, writes: \"Worst-case thinking encourages society
to adopt fear as one of the dominant principles around which the
public]{.underline}, the government and institutions [should organize
their life. **It institutionalizes insecurity and fosters a mood of
confusion and powerlessness.**]{.underline} [Through popularizing the
belief that worst cases are normal, it incites people to feel
defenseless and vulnerable to a wide range of future threats.\" Even
worse, it plays directly into the hands of terrorists, creating a
population that is easily terrorized]{.underline} \-- even by failed
terrorist attacks like the Christmas Day underwear bomber and the Times
Square SUV bomber. When someone is proposing a change, the onus should
be on them to justify it over the status quo. But [worst-case thinking
is a way of looking at the world that exaggerates the rare and unusual
and gives the rare much more credence than it deserves. It isn\'t really
a principle; it\'s a cheap trick to justify what you already believe. It
lets lazy or biased people make what seem to be cogent arguments without
understanding the whole issue. And when people don\'t need to refute
counterarguments, there\'s no point in listening to them.]{.underline}

#### Imperial information distorts their picture of the world and the policy outcomes.

**Shor 10** -- Professor of History at Wayne State University

Francis Shor, "Dying Empire: US Imperialism and Global Resistance,"

In order to excavate and explode the mental landscapes created by
imperial enclosures, we will need to confront and transcend the
blinkered intelligence, impeded wills, and hectored hearts that are
integral to the [imperial]{.underline} and civic
[enclosures]{.underline} that [**surround us** in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [These enclosures are enerated
by ideological mechanisms, media constructions, and daily social
practices that are deeply embedded in the political culture of an
imperial U.S.]{.underline} [From uncritical patriotism, induced by
ruling elites and ritualized by the corporate media]{.underline}, to
cultural provincialism, [U.S. citizens are **ensconced in an imperial
matrix** that **distorts reality** and **nurtures \"aggressive
militarism**\" and \'escalating authoritarianism]{.underline}.\" \"As
the militarization of American society proceeds,\"
[contends]{.underline} Carl [Boggs]{.underline}, \"[the confluence of
the domestic war economy and global Empire generates popular attitudes
inconsistent with a vibrant, democratic public sphere: fear hatred,
jingoism, racism, and aggression]{.underline}. [We have arrived at a
bizarre mixture of imperial arrogance and collective paranoia, violent
impulses and a retreat from the norms of civic engagement and obligation
that patriotic energies furnish only falsely and
ephemerally.\"]{.underline}

Recognizing how falsely and ephemerally patriotism attempts to assuage
the assaults of militarism and imperialism, a number of feminist
dissenters have promoted \"matriotism\" as a key component of critical
opposition. Among the more prominent proponents of matriotism was Cindy
Sheehan, the anti-war advocate who became a lightning rod for opponents
of the Iraq War after her son, Casey, was killed in Iraq. Writing in
January 2006, Sheehan argued that a \"true Matriot would never drop an
atomic bomb or bombs filled with white phosphorous, carpet bomb cities,
and villages, or control drones from thousands of miles away to kill
innocent men, women and children.\" Beyond this critique of war-making,
Sheehan urged those among her readers who would join other matriots \"to
stand up and say: \"No, I'm not giving my child to the fake patriotism
of the war machine which chews up my flesh and blood to spit out obscene
profits.\"

While [flag-wavering patriotism]{.underline} may provide ideological
cover for the mendacity of ruling elites and compensatory status for the
powerless, it also [reinforces the self-enclosure of
imperialism]{.underline}. [The desperate need to display the
flag]{.underline}, from the phalanxes of those that now accompany the
public appearances of U.S. presidents to the periodic fluttering outside
the homes of average citizens, [provides a]{.underline} [symbolic ritual
for imperial legitimacy]{.underline}. In effect, [the]{.underline}

[more uncritical the]{.underline} kind of [patriotism that rules popular
imagination]{.underline} and public discourse, the more alone,
insulated, special and different the American ethos makes people feel.
[The more it holds up a distorting mirror to itself and the rest of the
world, **the more incomprehensible the rest of the world becomes,** full
of inarticulate, hostile elements.]{.underline}

That distorting mirror is not only part of the imperial narrative that
represents the United States as the repository of good in the world, but
is also a function of the role of corporate media\'s presentation of the
world. [Through the use of framing and filtering devices, U.S. corporate
media]{.underline}, especially television, [manage to **narrow and
exclude critical perspectives**, **leading to significant
misperceptions**]{.underline}. In fact, according to a University of
Massachusetts study of television viewers during Operation Desert Storm
in 1991: \"the more TV people watched, the less they knew\....Despite
months of coverage, most people do not know basic facts about the
political situation in the Middle East, or about the recent history of
U.S. policy towards Iraq\" Added to media distortions,
misrepresentations, and complicity, the Bush Administration\'s
deliberate policy of disinformation in the lead-up to the Iraq War in
2003 further eroded the public\'s critical understanding of the
situation in the Middle East and Iraq. Erroneously insisting on ties
between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda and the presence of weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq, the Bush Administration and complicit corporate
media helped to frame the invasion and occupation of Iraq. Such
misperceptions persisted into 2006 when a Harris Poll found that 64
percent still believed that Hussein had strong links to al Qaeda and 50
percent were convinced that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction when
the U.S. invaded.

[The kind of **disinformation** spread by politicians and pundits and
reinforced by the media follows from our national and imperial myths
which, in turn, bother literally and figuratively separate us from the
rest of the world.]{.underline} While not a new phenomenon, such
imperial self-enclosure does seem even more striking in the globalized
and interconnected world we now inhabit. \"As the American media has
acquired a global reach,\" argue cultural critics Ziauddin Sardar and
Merryl Wyn Davies, \"it has simultaneously, and paradoxically, become
even more parochial and banal.\" According to Sardar and Davies, [the
media reinforce]{.underline} what they call \"[knowledgeable ignorance\"
by acting as \"the **gatekeeper** of what is relevant and necessary to
know about Third World civilizations]{.underline}.\" Often, most evident
in those mediage images are ones of random violence or poverty and
disease unrelated to U.S. policies. However, it is not just those
countries caught up in conflict, whether initiated by the United States
or endemic to a particular region, that suffer from media frames that
diminish or denigrate the reality of others\' lives. \"[As a function of
American narcissism]{.underline},\" notes another critic, \"[American
media tend to problematize all countries except the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates\....The absence of self-reflexivity or a sense of
humor and irony in viewing America\'s place in the world seems to be
part of the collective habitus.\"

[Even when U.S. citizens are aware of some vague relationship between
their government and conditions elsewhere, there remains a kind of
phenomenological disconnection, inherent in life in an imperial culture,
which impedes understanding of the causal connections]{.underline}.
Commenting on the violations perpetrated against peasants in central
America by U.S. sponsored militaries and para-militaries and the
resultant gross violations of human rights, Christian Smith observes: \"

Most Americans probably were, in fact, concerned about these problems.
But [for]{.underline} most [U.S. citizens]{.underline}, these
[injustices and atrocities remained]{.underline} essentially [abstract
and remote]{.underline}, [detached from the immediate affairs that
shaped their lives]{.underline}. It is not that most
[Americans]{.underline} were necessarily callous. They [simply lacked
the cultural and social positioning that would have infused these
violations with a sense of personal immediacy and urgency]{.underline}.

The lack of a cultural and social positioning is evident in the way some
[U.S. citizens continue to see the world through the same **blinkered
filters** that inform the dynamics of knowledgeable
ignorance]{.underline}. A good example of the misperception of the U.S.
role in the world is how the vast majority of U.S. citizens continue to
overestimate the largesse of their government\'s foreign aid. Although
most citizens believe the U.S. gives close to 10 percent of its GDP for
foreign aid, the U.S. actually gives closer to 0.1 percent. Moreover,
much of that aid is military material sent to Israel, Egypt, and Saudi
Arabia. A fictional example, albeit representative, of such
knowledgeable ignorance or imperial arrogance while abroad is the
evangelical Baptist father in Barbara Kingsolver\'s 1998 novel, The
Poisonwood Bible. Nathan Price stubbornly insists that every last bit of
U.S. culture and horticulture can be easily transplanted in the Congo in
the midst of the Cold War. With such imperial blinders and blinkered
intelligence he manages to endanger his whole family, resulting in the
death of one child and his own demise.

It could be suggested that the [present risk-oriented preoccupation with
symptoms is itself symptomatic of IR's insufficient self-reflection on
its own role in this problem. Despite the normative emphasis on ensuring
national and international security, the literature's overwhelming
preoccupation with gauging the multiplicity of ways in which ecological,
energy and economic crises might challenge security in coming decades
provides **very little opening** in either theory or policy to develop
more effective strategies to mitigate or prevent these heightened
security challenges]{.underline}. On the contrary, for the most part,
[these approaches tend to highlight the **necessity to maximise national
political**--military and international regimes' powers so that states
might be able to respond more robustly in the event that new threats
like resource wars and state failure do emerge. But the **futility of
this trajectory is obvious** -- a preoccupation with 'security' ends up
becoming an unwitting accomplice in the intensification of
**insecurity**.]{.underline}

The [extent of orthodox IR theory's complicity in this predicament is
evident in its reduction of inter-state relations to balance-of-power
dynamics, despite a lack of determinate bases by which to define and
delineate the dynamics of material power]{.underline}. While orthodox
realism focuses inordinately on a military--political conceptualisation
of national power, conventional attempts to extend this
conceptualisation to include economic dimensions (including the role of
transnational corporations) -- as well as production, finance, ideas and
institutions beyond the state -- do not solve the problem.75 [This
Weberian proliferation of categorisations of the multiple dimensions of
power, while useful, lacks a unifying explanatory order of determination
capable of rendering their interconnections intelligible.]{.underline}

As Rosenberg shows in his analysis of the dynamics of distinctive
geopolitical orders from Rome to Spain -- and Teschke in his exploration
of the changing polities of continental Europe from the eighth to the
eighteenth centuries -- these orders have always been inseparably
conjoined with their constitutive relations of production as structured
in the context of prevailing social-- property [relations]{.underline},
illustrating the mutually-embedded nature of 'economic' and
'extra-economic' power.76 In contrast, orthodox IR axiomatically
fragments the 'economic' and 'extra-economic' (and the latter further
into 'military', 'political', 'cultural', etc.) into separate,
autonomous spheres with no grasp of the scope of their
interconnection.77

[It also **dislocates** both the state, and human existence as such,
from their fundamental material conditions of existence, in the form of
their relationship to the biophysical environment, as mediated through
relations of production, and the way these are governed and contested
through social--property relations.78 By externalising the biophysical
environment -- and thus human metabolism with nature -- from state
praxis, orthodox IR simply lacks the conceptual categories necessary to
recognise the extent to which socio-political organisational forms are
mutually constituted by human embeddedness in the natural
world]{.underline}.79 While further fragmenting the international into a
multiplicity of disconnected state units whose behaviour can only be
analysed through the limited lenses of anarchy or hierarchy, orthodox IR
is incapable of situating these units in the holistic context of the
global political economy, the role of transnational capitalist classes,
and the structural pressures thereby exerted on human and state
behaviour.80

[Indeed, the mediating structure of the global political economy --
along with the beliefs and behaviour of agents within it (through which
this structure is constructed) -- play a critical role in the
transformation of ecological or resource-related events into concrete
politically-defined conditions of 'scarcity' that lead to **crisis or
conflict.**]{.underline} A powerful example is provided by Davis in his
study of the impact of the El Niño--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) -- the
vast oscillation in air mass and Pacific Ocean temperature. In the last
quarter of the nineteenth century, ENSO created large-scale droughts in
many countries peripheral to the European empires, including those in
Asia (India, China, Java, the Philippines and Korea), and in Brazil,
southern Africa, Algeria and Morocco. Davis shows that British 'free
market' imperial policy converted these droughts into foreseeable but
preventable deadly famines, multiplying death tolls to gross proportions
without any historical precedent.81

In 1874--76, northern harvests were more than sufficient to provide
reserves for the 1878 autumn crops deficit. But most of the grain from
north-western Indian subsistence farming was controlled by a captive
export sector designed to stabilise British grain prices, which from
1876 to 1877 had increased due to poor harvests. This generated a
British demand that absorbed almost the entirety of north-western
India's wheat surplus. Meanwhile, profits from these grain exports were
monopolised by wealthy property holders, moneylenders and grain
merchants, as opposed to poor Indian farmers. India's newly-constructed
modern railway system shipped grain from drought areas 'to central
depots for hoarding', leading to exorbitant price hikes that were
'co-ordinated in a thousand towns at once'. Food prices rocketed out of
the reach of 'outcaste labourers, displaced weavers, sharecroppers and
poor peasants'. Consequently, 'the poor began to starve to death even in
well-watered districts "reputed to be immune to food shortages"'. Thus,
between 1877 and 1878, grain merchants exported a record 6.4 million
hundredweight of wheat to Europe while between 5.5 and 12 million
Indians starved to death. This catastrophe occurred 'not outside the
modern world system, but in the very process of being forcibly
incorporated into its economic and political structures'. 82

As Dalby thus argues, '[humans live in a complex interaction with
environments that adapt and change in much more complex ways than is
facilitated by linear thinking within the territorial boxes of
contemporary administrative arrangements'. This suggests 'that "global"
markets and economic connections are essential to understanding the
complex politics of "local" environments and struggles over access to
specific resources in particular places' -- because the 'geography of
the domination of nature' is precisely the continuing 'history of
colonisation and imperialism'. 83 Hence, environmental and energy crises
are generated in the context of **historically-specific sociopolitical
systems**]{.underline} -- [and whether or not they lead to conflict
depends on existing relations of power at local, national and
transnational scales, and on how those relations are configured by
structures of resource ownership, mediated by ideas and values, and
supported by military power.]{.underline}

3\. From securitisation to militarisation

3.1 Complicity

[This analysis thus calls for a broader approach to environmental
security based on retrieving the manner in which political actors
construct discourses of 'scarcity' in response to ecological, energy and
economic crises (critical security studies) in the context of the
historically-specific socio-political and geopolitical relations of
domination by which their power is constituted, and which are often
implicated in the acceleration of these very crises]{.underline}
(historical sociology and historical materialism).

Instead, [both realist and liberal orthodox IR approaches focus on
different aspects of interstate behaviour, conflictual and cooperative
respectively, but each lacks the capacity to grasp that the
**unsustainable trajectory** of state and inter-state behaviour is only
explicable in the context of a wider global system]{.underline}
concurrently over-exploiting the biophysical environment in which it is
embedded. [They are, in other words, unable to address the relationship
of the inter-state system itself to the biophysical environment as a key
analytical category for understanding the **acceleration of global
crises.**]{.underline} [They simultaneously therefore cannot recognise
the embeddedness of the economy in society and the concomitant
politically-constituted nature of economics]{.underline}.84

Hence, [they neglect the profound irrationality of collective state
behaviour, which systematically erodes this relationship**, globalising
insecurity on a massive scale** -- in the very process of seeking
security]{.underline}.85 In Cox's words, [because positivist IR theory
'does not question the present order \[it instead\] has the effect of
**legitimising** and **reifying** it'.]{.underline} 86 [Orthodox IR
**sanitises globally-destructive** collective inter-state behaviour as a
normal function of instrumental reason -- thus rationalising what are
clearly deeply irrational collective human actions that threaten to
permanently erode state power and security by destroying the **very
conditions of human existence**.]{.underline} Indeed, the prevalence of
orthodox IR as a body of disciplinary beliefs, [norms and prescriptions
organically conjoined with actual policy-making in the international
system highlights the extent to which both realism and liberalism are
ideologically implicated in the acceleration of **global systemic
crises**.87]{.underline}

By the same token, [the incapacity to recognise and critically
interrogate how prevailing social, political and economic structures are
driving global crisis acceleration has led to the proliferation of
**symptom-led solutions focused** on the **expansion of state/regime
military--political power** rather than any attempt to transform root
structural causes.]{.underline}88 It is in this context that, as the
prospects for meaningful reform through inter-state cooperation appear
increasingly nullified under the pressure of actors with a vested
interest in sustaining prevailing geopolitical and economic structures,
[states have resorted progressively more to militarised responses
designed to protect the concurrent structure of the international system
from dangerous new threats. In effect, the failure of orthodox
approaches to accurately diagnose global crises, directly accentuates a
tendency to 'securitise' them -- and this, ironically, fuels the
proliferation of violent conflict and militarisation responsible for
magnified global insecurity.]{.underline}

['Securitisation' refers to a 'speech act']{.underline} [-- an act of
labelling -- whereby political authorities identify particular issues or
incidents as an existential threat which, because of their extreme
nature, justify going beyond the normal security measures that are
within the rule of law]{.underline}. It thus legitimises resort to
special extra-legal powers. [By labelling issues a matter of 'security',
therefore, states are able to move them outside the remit of democratic
decision-making and into the realm of emergency powers]{.underline}, all
in the name of survival itself. Far from representing a mere aberration
from democratic state practice, this discloses a deeper 'dual' structure
of the state in its institutionalisation of the capacity to mobilise
extraordinary extra-legal military-- police measures in purported
response to an existential danger.89

[The problem in the context of global ecological, economic and energy
crises is that such levels of emergency mobilisation and militarisation
**have no positive impact** on the very global crises generating 'new
security challenges', and are thus entirely
disproportionate]{.underline}.90 All that remains to examine is on the
'surface' of the international system (geopolitical competition, the
balance of power, international regimes, globalisation and so on),
phenomena which are dislocated from their structural causes by way of
being unable to recognise the biophysically-embedded and
politically-constituted social relations of which they are comprised.
[The consequence is that orthodox IR has no means of responding to
global systemic crises other than to reduce them to their
symptoms.]{.underline}

Indeed, [orthodox IR theory has largely responded to global systemic
crises not with new theory, but with the expanded application of
existing theory to 'new security challenges' such as 'low-intensity'
**intra-state conflicts**; inequality and poverty; **environmental
degradation**; international criminal activities including drugs and
arms trafficking; **proliferation of weapons of mass destruction**; and
**international terrorism**]{.underline}.91 Although the majority of
such 'new security challenges' are non-military in origin -- whether
their referents are states or individuals -- [the inadequacy of systemic
theoretical frameworks to diagnose them means they are primarily
examined through the lenses of military-political power.92 In other
words, the escalation of global ecological, energy and economic crises
is recognised not as evidence that the current organisation of the
global political economy is **fundamentally unsustainable**, **requiring
urgent transformation**, but as vindicating the necessity for states to
radicalise the exertion of their military--political capacities to
maintain existing power structures, to keep the lid on.93]{.underline}

[Global crises are thus viewed as amplifying factors that could mobilise
the popular will in ways that challenge existing political and economic
structures, which it is presumed (given that state power itself is
constituted by these structures) deserve protection]{.underline}. This
justifies the state's adoption of extra-legal measures outside the
normal sphere of democratic politics. In the context of global crisis
impacts, this counter-democratic trend-line can result in a growing
propensity to problematise potentially recalcitrant populations --
rationalising violence toward them as a control mechanism.

3.2 From theory to policy

Consequently, for the most part, [the policy implications of orthodox IR
approaches involve a redundant conceptualisation of global systemic
crises purely as potential 'threat-multipliers' of traditional security
issues such as 'political instability around the world, the collapse of
governments and the creation of terrorist safe havens'. Climate change
will serve to amplify the threat of international terrorism,
particularly in regions with large populations and scarce
resources.]{.underline}94 The US Army, for instance, depicts climate
change as a 'stress-multiplier' that will 'exacerbate tensions' and
'complicate American foreign policy'; while the EU perceives it as a
'threat-multiplier which exacerbates existing trends, tensions and
instability'. 95

In practice, [this generates an **excessive preoccupation** not with the
causes of global crisis acceleration and how to ameliorate them through
structural transformation, but with their purportedly **inevitable
impacts**, and how to prepare for them by controlling problematic
populations. Paradoxically, this 'securitisation' of global crises does
not render us safer.]{.underline} Instead, [by necessitating more
violence, while inhibiting preventive action, it guarantees greater
insecurity.]{.underline} Thus, a recent US Department of Defense report
explores the future of international conflict up to 2050. It warns of
'resource competition induced by growing populations and expanding
economies', particularly due to a projected 'youth bulge' in the South,
which 'will consume ever increasing amounts of food, water and energy'.
This will prompt a 'return to traditional security threats posed by
emerging near-peers as we compete globally for depleting natural
resources and overseas markets'. Finally, climate change will 'compound'
these stressors by generating humanitarian crises, population migrations
and other complex emergencies.96

A similar study by the US Joint Forces Command draws attention to the
danger of global energy depletion through to 2030. Warning of 'the
dangerous vulnerabilities the growing energy crisis presents', the
report concludes that 'The implications for future conflict are
ominous.' 97 Once again, the subject turns to demographics: 'In total,
the world will add approximately 60 million people each year and reach a
total of 8 billion by the 2030s', 95 per cent accruing to developing
countries, while populations in developed countries slow or decline.
'Regions such as the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, where the youth
bulge will reach over 50% of the population, will possess fewer
inhibitions about engaging in conflict.' 98 The assumption is that
regions which happen to be both energy-rich and Muslim-majority will
also be sites of violent conflict due to their rapidly growing
populations.

A British Ministry of Defence report concurs with this assessment,
highlighting an inevitable 'youth bulge' by 2035, with some 87 per cent
of all people under the age of 25 inhabiting developing countries. In
particular, the Middle East population will increase by 132 per cent and
sub-Saharan Africa by 81 per cent. Growing resentment due to 'endemic
unemployment' will be channelled through 'political militancy, including
radical political Islam whose concept of Umma, the global Islamic
community, and resistance to capitalism may lie uneasily in an
international system based on nation-states and global market forces'.
More strangely, predicting an intensifying global divide between a
super-rich elite, the middle classes and an urban under-class, the
report warns: 'The world's middle classes might unite, using access to
knowledge, resources and skills to shape transnational processes in
their own class interest.' 99

3.3 Exclusionary logics of global crisis securitisation?

Thus, [the securitisation of global crisis leads not only to the
problematisation of particular religious and ethnic groups in foreign
regions of geopolitical interest, but potentially extends this
problematisation to any social group which might challenge prevailing
global political economic structures across racial, national and class
lines.]{.underline} [The previous examples illustrate how securitisation
paradoxically generates insecurity by reifying a process of
militarisation against social groups that are constructed as external to
the prevailing geopolitical and economic order. In other words, the
internal reductionism, fragmentation and compartmentalisation that
plagues orthodox theory and policy reproduces precisely these
characteristics by **externalising global crises from one another**,
externalising states from one another, externalising the inter-state
system from its biophysical environment, and externalising new social
groups as **dangerous 'outsiders'**.]{.underline} Hence, [a simple
discursive analysis of state militarisation and the construction of new
'outsider' identities is insufficient to understand the causal dynamics
driving the process of 'Otherisation']{.underline}. As Doug Stokes
points out, the Western state preoccupation with the ongoing military
struggle against international terrorism reveals an underlying
'discursive complex', where representations about terrorism and
non-Western populations are premised on 'the construction of stark
boundaries' that 'operate to exclude and include'. Yet [these
exclusionary discourses are 'intimately bound up with political and
economic processes', such as strategic interests in proliferating
military bases in the Middle East, economic interests in control of oil,
and the wider political goal of 'maintaining American hegemony' by
dominating a resource-rich region critical for global
capitalism]{.underline}.100

But [even this does not go far enough, for arguably the construction of
certain hegemonic discourses is mutually constituted by these
geopolitical, strategic and economic interests -- exclusionary
discourses are **politically constituted**]{.underline}. New conceptual
developments in genocide studies throw further light on this in terms of
the concrete socio-political dynamics of securitisation processes. It is
now widely recognised, for instance, that the distinguishing criterion
of genocide is not the pre-existence of primordial groups, one of which
destroys the other on the basis of a preeminence in bureaucratic
military--political power. Rather, genocide is the intentional attempt
to destroy a particular social group that has been socially constructed
as different. 101 As Hinton observes, genocides precisely constitute a
process of 'othering' in which an imagined community becomes reshaped so
that previously 'included' groups become 'ideologically recast' and
dehumanised as threatening and dangerous outsiders, be it along ethnic,
religious, political or economic lines -- eventually legitimising their
annihilation.102

In other words, [genocidal violence is inherently rooted in a **prior
and ongoing ideological process**, whereby exclusionary group categories
are innovated, constructed and 'Otherised' in accordance with a specific
socio-political programme]{.underline}. [The very process of identifying
and classifying particular groups as outside the boundaries of an
imagined community of 'inclusion', justifying exculpatory violence
toward them, is itself a political act without which **genocide would be
impossible**.]{.underline}103 This recalls Lemkin's recognition that the
intention to destroy a group is integrally connected with a wider
socio-political project -- or colonial project -- designed to perpetuate
the political, economic, cultural and ideological relations of the
perpetrators in the place of that of the victims, by interrupting or
eradicating their means of social reproduction. [Only by **interrogating
the dynamic and origins** of this programme to uncover the social
relations from which that programme derives can the emergence of
genocidal intent become explicable]{.underline}.104

### 2NC\-\--!\-\--Militarism

#### Security threats are political constructions by experts to justify constant militarism.

Despite such democratic concerns, a large part of [what makes today\'s
dominant security concept so compelling are two **purportedly
objective** sociological claims about the nature of modern threat. As
these claims undergird the current security concept, this conclusion
assesses them more directly and, in the process, indicates what they
suggest about the prospects for any future reform. The first claim is
that global interdependence means that the United States faces near
continuous threats from abroad]{.underline}. Just as Pearl Harbor
presented a physical attack on the homeland justifying a revised
framework, [the American position]{.underline} in the world since [has
been one of permanent insecurity in the face of new,]{.underline}
equally [objective dangers]{.underline}. Although today [these
threats]{.underline} no longer come from menacing totalitarian regimes
like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union, [they]{.underline} nonetheless
[create **a world of chaos and instability** in which American domestic
peace is imperiled by decentralized terrorists and aggressive rogue
states]{.underline}. n310 \[\*1486\] [Second, and relatedly, the
objective complexity of modern threats makes it impossible for ordinary
citizens to comprehend fully the causes and likely consequences of
existing dangers. Thus, the best response is the further entrenchment of
the national security state, with the U.S. **military permanently
mobilized** to gather intelligence and to combat enemies wherever they
strike]{.underline}-at home or abroad. [Accordingly]{.underline},
[modern legal and political institutions that privilege]{.underline}
executive [authority and insulated decision-making are simply the
**necessary consequence of these externally generated crises**.
Regardless of these trade-offs, the security benefits of an empowered
presidency]{.underline}-one armed with countless secret and public
agencies as well as with a truly global military footprint n311
-[greatly outweigh the costs]{.underline}. Yet although these
sociological views have become commonplace, [the conclusions that
Americans should draw about security requirements are not nearly as
clear cut as the conventional wisdom assumes]{.underline}. In
particular, [a closer examination of contemporary arguments about
endemic danger suggests]{.underline} that [**such claims are not
objective empirical judgments**, but rather]{.underline} are [socially
complex and politically infused interpretations]{.underline}. Indeed,
the openness of existing circumstances to multiple interpretations of
threat implies that the presumptive need for secrecy and centralization
is not self-evident. And as underscored by high profile failures in
expert assessment, [claims to security expertise are themselves riddled
with ideological presuppositions and subjective biases]{.underline}. All
[this indicates that the gulf between elite knowledge and lay
incomprehension in matters of security may be far less extensive than is
ordinarily thought. It also means that the question of who
decides]{.underline}-and with it the issue of how democratic or insular
our institutions should be-[remains open]{.underline} as well. Clearly,
[technological changes, from airpower to biological and chemical
weapons, have shifted the nature of America\'s position in
the]{.underline} \[\*1487\] [world and its potential
vulnerability]{.underline}. As has been widely remarked for nearly a
century, the oceans alone cannot guarantee our permanent safety. Yet in
truth, they never fully ensured domestic tranquility. The nineteenth
century was one of near continuous violence, especially with indigenous
communities fighting to protect their territory from expansionist
settlers. n312 [But even if technological shifts make doomsday scenarios
more chilling than those faced by Hamilton, Jefferson, or Taney, **the
mere existence of these scenarios tells us little about their likelihood
or how best to address them**]{.underline}. Indeed, [these latter
security judgments are inevitably permeated with **subjective political
assessments**-assessments that carry with them preexisting ideological
points of view-such as]{.underline} regarding how much risk
constitutional societies should accept or [how interventionist states
should be in foreign policy]{.underline}. In fact, from its emergence in
the 1930s and 1940s, supporters of the modern security concept have-at
times unwittingly-reaffirmed the political rather than purely objective
nature of interpreting external threats. In particular, commentators
have repeatedly noted the link between the idea of insecurity and
America\'s post- World War II position of global primacy, one which
today has only expanded following the Cold War. n313 In 1961, none other
than Senator James William Fulbright declared, in terms reminiscent of
Herring and Frankfurter, that security imperatives meant that \"our
basic constitutional machinery, admirably suited to the needs of a
remote agrarian republic in the 18th century,\" was no longer
\"adequate\" for the \"20th-century nation.\" n314 For Fulbright, the
driving impetus behind the need to jettison antiquated constitutional
practices was the importance of sustaining the country\'s
\"pre-eminen\[ce\] in political and military power.\" n315 Fulbright
believed that greater executive action and war- making capacities were
essential precisely because the United States found itself \"burdened
with all the enormous responsibilities that accompany such power.\" n316
According to Fulbright, the United States had \[\*1488\] both a right
and a duty to suppress those forms of chaos and disorder that existed at
the edges of American authority. n317 Thus, rather than being purely
objective, [the American condition of permanent danger was itself deeply
tied to political calculations about the importance of global primacy.
What generated the condition of continual crisis was not only
technological change, but also the belief that the United States\' own
national security rested on the successful projection of
power]{.underline} into the internal affairs of foreign states. The key
point is that [**regardless of whether one agrees with such an
underlying project**, the value of this project is ultimately an open
political question]{.underline}. [This suggests that]{.underline}
[whether distant crises should be viewed as generating insecurity at
home is similarly as much an **interpretative judgment as an empirically
verifiable** conclusion]{.underline}. n318 To appreciate the open nature
of security determinations, one need only look at the presentation of
terrorism as a principle and overriding danger facing the country.
According to National Counterterrorism Center\'s 2009 Report on
Terrorism, in 2009 there were just twenty-five U.S. noncombatant
fatalities from terrorism worldwide-nine abroad and sixteen at home.
n319 [While the fear of a terrorist attack is a legitimate concern,
these numbers-which have been consistent in recent years-place the
gravity of the threat in perspective. Rather than a condition of endemic
danger]{.underline}-requiring ever-increasing secrecy and
centralization-[such facts are perfectly consistent with a reading that
Americans **do not face an existential crisis**]{.underline} (one
presumably comparable to Pearl Harbor) and [actually enjoy relative
security.]{.underline} Indeed, the [disconnect between numbers and
resources expended]{.underline}, especially in a time of profound
economic insecurity, [highlights the political choice of policymakers
and citizens to persist in interpreting foreign events through
a]{.underline} World War II and early Cold War **[lens of permanent
threat.]{.underline}** In fact, the continuous alteration of basic
constitutional values to fit national security aims emphasizes just how
entrenched Herring\'s old vision of security as pre-political and
foundational has become, regardless of whether other interpretations of
the present moment may be equally compelling. It also underscores a
telling and often ignored point about the nature of \[\*1489\] modern
security expertise, particularly as reproduced by the United States\'
massive intelligence infrastructure. [To the extent that political
assumptions-like the centrality of global primacy or the view that
instability abroad necessarily implicates security at home-shape the
interpretative approach of executive officials, what passes as objective
security expertise is itself **intertwined with contested claims about
how to view external actors** and their motivations. These]{.underline}
[assumptions mean that while modern conditions may well be complex, the
conclusions of the presumed experts]{.underline} [may not be
systematically less liable to subjective bias than judgments made by
ordinary citizens]{.underline} based on publicly available information.
[It]{.underline} further [underlines that the question of who decides
**cannot be foreclosed in advance** by simply asserting deference to
elite knowledge.]{.underline} If anything, one can argue that [the
presumptive gulf between elite awareness and suspect mass opinion has
generated]{.underline} its own very [dramatic political and legal
pathologies]{.underline}. In recent years, [the country has witnessed a
variety of **security crises built on the basic failure of
\"expertise**]{.underline}.\" n320 At present, part of [what obscures
this fact is the very culture of secret information]{.underline}
sustained by the modern security concept. Today, it is commonplace for
government officials to leak security material about terrorism or
external threats to newspapers as a method of shaping the public debate.
n321 These \"open\" secrets allow greater public access to elite
information and embody a central and routine instrument for
incorporating mass voice into state decision-making.

What is changing? This: [the contradictions and predations of
patriarchal imperialist capitalism]{.underline}, [and of the deeply
racist and gendered material and symbolic order it
produces]{.underline}, [have enabled an **accelerating**,
**unrelenting**, **unfettered extractive stance** toward the planet, its
ecosystems and natural resources, and the plant and animal species and
human beings that inhabit it. That stance has not only resulted in
increasingly outrageous inequalities and concentrations of wealth; it
has gotten us to the brink of **climate catastrophe**, **ecosystem
collapse**, and **a vast, literally unimaginable intensification and
expansion of human immiseration and suffering**]{.underline}. So [what
is changing in security]{.underline} (if not in security studies,
critical or otherwise) [is **everything** -- from the entire context of
stable planetary ecosystems that gave rise to the way our world is
politically, economically and socially structured, to our understandings
of those structures, and to our models and theories of what constitutes
security within them, be it state security or human
security]{.underline}.

[We can no longer claim to be thinking about security unless we address
the model that conceives the purpose of economic activity as
ever-increasing 'efficiencies' of extraction, exploitation and
consumption of nature's resources, and of human labour]{.underline},
both paid and unpaid, [for the purpose of profit -- rather
than]{.underline}, for example, [conceiving the purpose of economic
activity as meeting human needs for a decent and dignified life, and
ensuring the sustainability of the resources and ecosystems on which
life depends]{.underline}.

### 2NC\-\--!\-\--Root Cause

**Burke 7** -- Associate Professor of Politics and International
Relations in the University of New South Wales

Anthony Burke, "Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason,"
Theory & Event, https://muse.jhu.edu/article/218079

My argument here, whilst normatively sympathetic to Kant\'s moral demand
for the eventual abolition of war, militates against excessive
optimism.86 Even as I am arguing that [war is not]{.underline} an
enduring historical or anthropological feature, or a [neutral and
rational instrument of policy \--]{.underline} that [it is rather the
product of **hegemonic forms of knowledge** about political action and
community]{.underline} \-- my analysis does suggest some sobering
conclusions about its power as an idea and formation. Neither the
progressive flow of history nor the pacific tendencies of an
international society of republican states will save us. The [violent
ontologies]{.underline} I have described here in fact do[minate the
conceptual and policy frameworks of modern republican
states]{.underline} and have come, against everything Kant hoped for, to
stand in for progress, modernity and reason. Indeed what Heidegger
argues, I think with some credibility, is that the enframing world view
has come to stand in for being itself. Enframing, argues Heidegger,
\'does not simply endanger man in his relationship to himself and to
everything that is\...it drives out every other possibility of
revealing\...the rule of Enframing threatens man with the possibility
that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing
and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth.\'87

What I take from Heidegger\'s argument \-- one that I have sought to
extend [by analysing the militaristic power of modern ontologies of
political existence and security]{.underline} \-- is a view that [the
challenge is posed not merely by a few varieties of weapon, government,
technology or policy, but by an overarching system of thinking and
understanding that lays claim to our entire space of truth and
existence.]{.underline} [Many of the most destructive features of
contemporary modernity \-- **militarism, repression, coercive diplomacy,
covert intervention, geopolitics, economic exploitation and ecological
destruction** \-- derive not merely from particular choices by
policymakers based on their particular interests, but from calculative,
\'empirical\' discourses of scientific and political truth]{.underline}
rooted in powerful enlightenment images of being. Confined within such
an epistemological and cultural universe, [policymakers\' choices become
necessities, their actions become inevitabilities, and humans suffer and
die.]{.underline} Viewed in this light, [\'rationality\' is the name we
give the chain of reasoning which builds one structure of truth on
another until a course of action, however violent or dangerous, becomes
preordained through that reasoning\'s very operation and
existence]{.underline}. It creates both discursive constraints \--
available choices may simply not be seen as credible or legitimate \--
and material constraints that derive from [the mutually reinforcing
cascade of discourses]{.underline} and events which then [preordain
militarism and violence as necessary policy responses, however
ineffective, dysfunctional or chaotic.]{.underline}

The force of my own and Heidegger\'s analysis does, admittedly, tend
towards a deterministic fatalism. On my part this is quite deliberate;
it is important to allow this possible conclusion to weigh on us. [Large
sections of modern societies]{.underline} \-- especially parts of the
media, political leaderships and national security institutions \-- [are
utterly trapped]{.underline} within the Clausewitzian paradigm,
[within]{.underline} the instrumental utilitarianism of \'enframing\'
and [the stark ontology of the friend and enemy]{.underline}. [They are
certainly tremendously aggressive and energetic in continually stating
and reinstating its force.]{.underline}

[But is there a way out]{.underline}? Is there no possibility of agency
and choice? Is this not the key normative problem I raised at the
outset, of how the modern ontologies of war efface agency, causality and
responsibility from decision making; the responsibility that comes with
having choices and making decisions, with exercising power? (In this I
am much closer to Connolly than Foucault, in Connolly\'s insistence
that, even in the face of the anonymous power of discourse to produce
and limit subjects, selves remain capable of agency and thus incur
responsibilities.88) There seems no point in following Heidegger in
seeking a more \'primal truth\' of being \-- that is [to]{.underline}
reinstate ontology and obscure its worldly manifestations and
consequences from critique. However [we can]{.underline}, while refusing
Heidegger\'s unworldly 89 nostalgia, appreciate that he was
[search]{.underline}ing [for a way out of the modern system of
calculation]{.underline}; that he was [search]{.underline}ing [for a
\'questioning\', \'free relationship\' to technology that would not be
immediately recaptured by the strategic, calculating vision of
enframing.]{.underline} Yet his path out is somewhat chimerical \-- his
faith in \'art\' and the older Greek attitudes of \'responsibility and
indebtedness\' offer us valuable clues to the kind of sensibility
needed, but little more.

When we consider the problem of [policy]{.underline}, the force of this
analysis suggests that [choice and agency can be all too often limited;
they can remain confined]{.underline} (sometimes quite wilfully) [within
the overarching strategic and security paradigms.]{.underline} Or, more
hopefully, [policy choices could aim to bring into being a more
enduringly inclusive, cosmopolitan and peaceful logic of the political.
But this cannot be done without seizing alternatives from **outside the
space of enframing and utilitarian strategic thought,** by being aware
of its presence and weight and activating a very different concept of
existence, security and action]{.underline}.90

This would seem to hinge upon \'questioning\' as such \-- on the
questions we put to the real and our efforts to create and act into it.
Do security and strategic policies seek to exploit and direct humans as
material, as energy, or do they seek to protect and enlarge human
dignity and autonomy? Do they seek to impose by force an unjust status
quo (as in Palestine), or to remove one injustice only to replace it
with others (the U.S. in Iraq or Afghanistan), or do so at an
unacceptable human, economic, and environmental price? Do we see our
actions within an instrumental, amoral framework (of \'interests\') and
a linear chain of causes and effects (the idea of force), or do we see
them as folding into a complex interplay of languages, norms, events and
consequences which are less predictable and controllable?91 And most
fundamentally: Are we seeking to coerce or persuade? Are less violent
and more sustainable choices available? Will our actions perpetuate or
help to end the global rule of insecurity and violence? Will our
thought?

#### The Perm Fails --- only complete rejection solves.

**Neocleous 8** -- Professor of the Critique of Political Economy at
Brunel University London, Editor of the journal Radical Philosophy,
holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Middlesex University London

Mark Neocleous, "Critique of Security," Edinburgh University Press,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt1r270k

[The only way out]{.underline} of such a dilemma, to escape the fetish,
[is]{.underline} perhaps **[to eschew the logic of security
altogether]{.underline}** - to reject it as so ideologically loaded in
favour of the state that any real political thought other than the
authoritarian and reactionary should be pressed to give it up. That is
clearly something that can not be achieved within the limits of
bourgeois thought and thus could never even begin to be imagined by the
security intellectual. It is also something that [the constant iteration
of the refrain \'this is an insecure world\']{.underline} and
reiteration of one fear, anxiety and insecurity after another
[will]{.underline} also [make it hard to do.]{.underline} But it is
something that the critique of security suggests we may have to consider
if we want a political way out of the impasse of security.

This impasse exists because [security has]{.underline} now [become so
all-encompassing that it **marginalises all else, most
notably**]{.underline} the constructive conflicts[,
**debates**]{.underline} and discussions **[that animate political
life]{.underline}**. The constant prioritising of a mythical security as
a political end - as the political end constitutes a rejection of
politics in any meaningful sense of the term. That is, as a mode of
action in which differences can be articulated, in which the conflicts
and struggles that arise from such differences can be fought for and
negotiated, in which people might come to believe that another world is
possible - that they might transform the world and in turn be
transformed. Security politics simply removes this; worse, it remoeves
it while purportedly addressing it. In so doing [it suppresses all
issues of power and turns political questions into debates about the
most efficient way to achieve \'security\',]{.underline} despite the
fact that we are never quite told - never could be told - what might
count as having achieved it. Security politics is, in this sense, an
anti-politics,\"\' dominating political discourse in much the same
manner as the security state tries to dominate human beings, reinforcing
security fetishism and the monopolistic character of security on the
political imagination. We therefore need to get beyond security
politics, not add yet more \'sectors\' to it in a way that simply
expands the scope of the state and legitimises state intervention in yet
more and more areas of our lives.

Simon Dalby reports a personal communication with Michael Williams,
co-editor of the important text Critical Security Studies, in which the
latter asks: [if you take away security, what do you put in the hole
that\'s left behind?]{.underline} But I\'m inclined to agree with Dalby:
**[maybe there is no hole]{.underline}**.\"\' The mistake has been to
think that there is a hole and that this hole needs to be filled with a
new vision or revision of security in which it is re-mapped or civilised
or gendered or humanised or expanded or whatever. All of these
ultimately remain within the statist political imaginary, and
consequently end up reaffirming the state as the terrain of modern
politics, the grounds of security. [The]{.underline} real [task
is]{.underline} not to fill the supposed hole with yet another vision of
security, but [to fight for an **alternative political language**
which]{.underline} takes us beyond the narrow horizon of bourgeois
security and which therefore [does not constantly throw us into the arms
of the state.]{.underline} That\'s the point of critical politics: to
develop a new political language more adequate to the kind of society we
want. Thus while much of what I have said here has been of a negative
order, part of the tradition of critical theory is that [the negative
may be as significant as the positive in setting thought on new
paths.]{.underline}

For if security really is the supreme concept of bourgeois society and
the fundamental thematic of liberalism, then [to keep harping on about
insecurity]{.underline} and to keep demanding \'more security\' (while
meekly hoping that this increased security doesn\'t damage our liberty)
[is to **blind ourselves** to]{.underline} the possibility of building
real [alternatives]{.underline} to the authoritarian tendencies in
contemporary politics. [To situate ourselves against security politics
would]{.underline} allow us to circumvent the debilitating effect
achieved through the constant securitising of social and political
issues, debilitating in the sense that \'security\' helps consolidate
the power of the existing forms of social domination and justifies the
short-circuiting of even the most democratic forms. It would also [allow
us to forge another kind of politics centred on a **different conception
of the good.**]{.underline} We need a new way of thinking and talking
about social being and politics that moves us beyond security. This
would perhaps be emancipatory in the true sense of the word. What this
might mean, precisely, must be open to debate. But it certainly requires
recognising that security is an illusion that has forgotten it is an
illusion; it requires recognising that security is not the same as
solidarity[; it requires accepting that insecurity is part of the human
condition,]{.underline} and thus giving up the search for the certainty
of security and instead [learning to tolerate the
uncertainties,]{.underline} ambiguities and \'insecurities\' [that come
with being human;]{.underline} it requires accepting that
[\'securitizing\' an issue does not mean dealing with it politically,
but **bracketing it out** and handing it to the state; **it requires us
to be brave enough to return the gift.\"\'**]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--AT: Realism Correct

#### Realism is Empirically Inaccurate --- laundry list proves --- our K has better explanatory power.

Relations at Carleton University, PhD in Political Science from Carleton

Kenneth Waltz may have been correct in that states are security
maximizers, but today, this may be occurring in a profoundly different
way than he originally envisioned. His famous dictum argues that states
look to maximize security though a balance of power that discourages
both predation and counterbalancing (Waltz, 1979: 126). However, [since
the end of the Cold War, we have seen a distinctively different sense of
security maximization: an ever-expanding domain of security
issues]{.underline}. [Despite appeals to the contrary (e.g. Walt, 1991),
the broadening of security has risen to the status of international
institutions, globalization and great power rivalry in terms of being a
**central**, if ambiguous, feature of contemporary world
politics.]{.underline}

**[Evidence of this broadening is pervasive]{.underline}**. The
[executive summary of the Pentagon's recent 'Quadrennial **defense
review'** begins with the clichéd claim that the US 'faces a rapidly
changing security environment', defined not only by interstate war, but
also by 'sectarian conflict' and cyber-threats (DoD, 2014: iii). While
intended to limit great power conflict, the United Nations (**UN)
Security Council** now increasingly deliberates over the dangers of
infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2011), Polio (UN News
Centre, 2013) and, more recently, Ebola (UNSC, 2014).]{.underline} [The
**Organization for Security and Cooperation** in Europe offers an even
starker example. Its 'comprehensive and co-operative' approach to
security holds arms control, the rule of law and minority rights as all
equally viable 'security' concerns]{.underline} (OSCE, 2009: ii). [This
broadening includes the wholesale addition of new sectoral concerns
(e.g. cyber-security), as well as an intensifying of traditional
dangers. Once materially insignificant and geographically distant
'rogue' states, terrorists groups and local militias are now understood
by policymakers and publics alike as 'genuine' threats to international
security]{.underline}. Debates over what is and is not a security issue
are now akin to a rowdy dinner table where several --- often uninvited
--- guests rub elbows with more traditional military concerns.

In the midst of this broadening, [there is a serious political and
practical concern for realist scholars of security]{.underline}. [If a
state is encumbered by an ever-expanding security agenda that consumes
more and more resources and promotes reckless adventurism abroad, what
then will be left when the genuine problem of great power conflict
emerges again?]{.underline} As a corrective, realists have repeatedly,
and often admirably, engaged in sustained advocacy campaigns to convince
publics and policymakers alike of the need to constrain the national
security agenda. Lost in the extensive literature on the realist
tradition is a rich history of political practice embodied by E.H.
Carr's interwar polemic against liberal idealism (Cox, 2001), [Hans
Morgenthau's and Kenneth Waltz's resistance to the **Vietnam war**
(Oren, 2009), and even contemporary neorealism's criticism of the US's
role in **Iraq** (Payne, 2007; Schmidt and Williams, 2008). While
realist advocacy is diverse, speaking out against expansive conceptions
of national security, or 'threat inflation' as it is more commonly
known, is a recurrent theme]{.underline}.1

While previous works by Payne (2007) and Oren (2009) highlight the [key
tensions between neorealist theory and practice, this article joins
Schmidt and Williams (2008) in questioning why such advocacy
fails.]{.underline} Like Schmidt and Williams, I see the 2003 [Iraq War
as a crucial example of realism's failure to influence public debate and
to curb an expansive vision of national security.]{.underline}2 Also, in
line with Schmidt and Williams, I am broadly [sympathetic to
explanations rooted in how a variety of 'symbolic and political
resources' (Schmidt and Williams, 2008: 194) were employed rhetorically
by neoconservatives against realists]{.underline}. My concern, however,
is that this explanation elides how realists sceptical of the Iraqi
threat were committed to a very specific model of advocacy anchored in
the metaphorical marketplace of ideas. In this ironically liberal model
of public discourse, [the market valuation of the Iraqi threat was
grossly inflated, something to be corrected through the provision of
superior information and reasoning]{.underline}. Even if realists had
been sensitive to the value of the rhetorical resources outlined by
Schmidt and Williams --- and I believe at some level that they were ---
the marketplace of ideas model is predicated on objective rational
actors debating over facts and logic, not values.

It is [against this backdrop of a tacitly liberal model of discourse
that I argue for the **value of securitization theory** in explaining
the failure of realist political advocacy]{.underline}. Contra the
marketplace of ideas, [securitization theory envisions debates over
security]{.underline} as explicitly power-laden, where 'some actors are
placed in positions of power by virtue of being generally accepted
voices of security' (Buzan et al., 1998: 31). Focusing specifically on
the 2003 Iraq War debate, I examine how rhetorical resources in the form
of identity and emotion were employed by neoconservatives against
realists.

#### Realism is wrong and takes out the perm.

Ironically, however, [adhering to such metatheoretical fiats proved to
entail serious political costs]{.underline}. It isolated realism from
all but the most conventional forms of post-positivist theorizing so
that Wendtian constructivism became 'the most radical widening
perspective to be addressed' (Buzan and Hansen, 2009: 163), if at all.
It arrested any richer conceptualization of security, save for the
comparatively insular debates between defensive and offensive realism.
At the end of the Cold War, [realists were left with a deeply
problematic and under-scrutinized concept of threat inflation as the
only way to account for the broadening of security agendas. When the
time came for explicit political advocacy against policies like the 2003
Iraq War, realists were confined by a framework where the perceived
danger of Saddam Hussein's regime rested solely on 'distorted history
and faulty logic']{.underline} (Mearsheimer and Walt, 2003a: 52). True
to their microeconomic foundations, [realists naively believed that such
a market inflation could be corrected through superior information and
reasoning, which they looked to provide. The **results were
tragic.**]{.underline}

[The inability of realists to grapple with, engage in, benefit from and
respond to the widening and deepening debates underscores the
first-order political risks of the incommensurability thesis. The
**effect is to silence alternatives** even though they have a direct
bearing on one's own political practice. The thesis 'be\[came\] a
legitimisation of **apartheid for paradigms**]{.underline}, a dialogue
of the deaf which precludes any exploration of the possibility of
synthesis' (Wight, 1996: 292). Yet, theories of security 'are not
hermetically sealed bodies of thought ... there are often significant
areas of overlap' (Wight, 1996: 312). Jackson and Nexon (2009) would
agree and go even further by arguing that most substantive bodies of
research in IR are, in fact, commensurable at some level. Discarding the
language of paradigms and programmes, they suggest an ideal-typical
mapping of the discipline along different dimensions of
commensurability, such as the plasticity of anarchy (Jackson and Nexon,
2009: 918). Sil and Katzenstein's (2010: 414--415) recent call for
analytical eclecticism similarly challenges the idea that
incommensurability poses a hopeless barrier to communication among
theories. Notably, this argument is made in the hopes of creating a more
practical, policy-oriented study of social science (Sil and Katzenstein,
2010: 412), which closely resembles the kind of knowledge that realists
look to use in their own advocacy.

#### Experts fail.

In his remarkable book Expert Political Judgment, Philip E. Tetlock
(2005) presents findings that might seem to account for some of the dire
events of the succeeding years. [Putting hundreds of experts through
rigorous tests of their ability to predict economic and political
trends, he found their predictions, on the whole, wanting]{.underline}.
[Experts performed only marginally better than they would have done by
randomly guessing among the alternative predictions that the tests
permitted. Experts actually performed **worse**, on average, than a
**standardized statistical model**]{.underline} that Tetlock designed to
extrapolate from long-term patterns and current trends in any context.
In addition to their lack of accuracy, Tetlock shows that the [experts
**consistently overestimated** their ability to make these predictions
accurately]{.underline}, [and that they failed to learn from their
mistakes\*refusing to admit that their methods or assumptions might need
revising.]{.underline} Although no category of experts performed
substantially better than others, [the ones that Tetlock calls
''hedgehogs''\*those who claimed to rely on a central idea or
explanatory notion\*did somewhat worse than his ''foxes''\*those who
used a complex and flexible intellectual approach.]{.underline}

In fact, apparently underlining Tetlock's concerns, [**disastrous
failures** of expert advice, real or alleged, have been a theme of the
past decade. In the run-up to the **Iraq** War, intelligence officials
drastically exaggerated the clarity of the evidence that Iraq possessed
weapons of mass destruction (Commission on Intelligence Capabilities
2005; Jervis 2010).]{.underline} [On many accounts, the financial crisis
and economic recession of **2008**-2010 were partly the result of
economic advice in the 1990s that promoted sweeping deregulation of
financial services and endorsed a wide range of high-risk investment
innovations contrived by financial managers]{.underline}.1 [In the
aftermath of the economic calamity, economists trumpeting a sharp
reversal in approach helped design some of the most expansive measures
for governmental direction of economic activity in American
history\*with results that remain to be seen.2 One might conclude that
the so-called experts have **no real insight**, and yet that
**policymakers act on their advice**, with the public suffering the
consequences. The problem with experts, in this view, is, as Tetlock
suggests, a severe shortage of discipline, accountability, and
ultimately competence.]{.underline}

---Erykah Badu, "On and On"

The future is "terra incognita": although we may be able to guess the
outcome of events that lie close to us, as we project beyond this we
enter an unmapped zone full of uncertainty. Paradoxically, the range of
options this reveals can seem paralysing. No one can definitively map
the future, but we can explore the possibilities in ways that are
specifically intended to support decision-making. **[[At Shell we use
scenario building to help us wrestle with]{.mark} the [developments and
behaviours that shape]{.mark} what [the future]{.mark} may hold and
prepare ourselves more effectively.]{.underline}** We also believe it
can inspire individuals and organisations to play a more active role in
shaping a better future---for themselves, or even on a global scale. In
this book, we use a metaphor of exploration and map-making to describe
how we think about building scenarios. Like a set of maps describing
different aspects of a landscape, scenarios provide us with a range of
perspectives on what might happen, helping us to navigate more
successfully. Exploration---of a territory or the future---involves both
analytical thinking rooted in whatever facts are clear, and also
informed intuition.

Imagine that a man hails a taxi and instructs the driver to take him to
a sustainable energy future. The taxi driver punches "sustainable
energy" into the car's GPS and steps on the gas pedal. Glancing at his
passenger in the rearview mirror, the driver asks, "Do you believe in
aliens?" For the rest of the ride, the taxi driver tells a tale of
outer-space creatures who have been watching human development on earth.
They notice that human actions have rendered the earth's ecosystem
increasingly tenuous and unsustainable and have depleted its energy
supply. Speculating about the earth's future and the potential of
earthlings to participate in an intergalactic community, the space
aliens in the driver's tale determine that humans are "a bit too
haphazard" to be "invited up to the intergalactic party." The driver
asserts, "We need to get better at seeing the bigger picture. We need to
face the energy challenge." He continues by explaining that, from his
present vantage point, one of two likely futures will become manifest.
The first is characterized by a disorganized and unsustainable
"scramble" for resources, with governments prioritizing the day-to-day
and delaying the big decisions necessary for long-term energy
sustainability in an unceasing game of catch-up focused on producing
more and more energy. The other entails the innovation of a cooperative
"blueprint," created by people all over the world taking action,
agitating for their governments to change laws, imagining new paths for
sustainable living, and working in harmony with the planet while "we all
continue to profit and grow." Clearly, the cooperative "blueprint" is
the better plan for the future that the "we" invoked here desire; and,
according to the taxi driver, it would earn humans an invitation to the
aforementioned intergalactic party. This narrative is offered in an
animated YouTube video produced by the future scenarios team at Royal
Dutch Shell plc (aka Shell).1 "Join the Taxi Ride to a Sustainable
Future" illustrates the multinational gas and oil company's recent
efforts to "look into the future" with their "Shell Energy Scenarios to
2050" project. A pioneer in the development of corporate "future
scenarios," Shell's **[[investment in "the future" involves forecasting
into and speculating about that future]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order
**[[to maximize]{.underline}]{.mark}** their
**[[profits]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is an investment in maintaining
its present status as a profitable multinational corporation. Attending
to how and why they produce knowledge about that future offers insights
into the temporality that sustains present relations. Royal Dutch
Shell's website not only showcases a set of future scenarios reports; it
also includes documents that explain the process of producing scenarios
and the benefits to corporations of doing so. **[According
to]{.underline}** the introduction to **["People and Connections: Global
Scenarios to 2020," [scenarios are]{.mark} "[a tool for helping managers
plan for]{.mark} . . . [different possible futures]{.mark}." [They
are]{.mark} "*[alternative stories of how the world may
develop]{.mark}*," [which]{.mark} "[help us understand the limitations
of our 'mental maps' of the world]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} to think the
unthinkable, anticipate the unknowable, and utilise both to make better
strategic decisions."]{.underline}**2 The future scenarios offered in
the 2050 project---"Scramble" and "Blueprints"---**[[draw from]{.mark}
the available [quantitative and qualitative data that Royal Dutch Shell
deems relevant to its present decision-making.]{.mark} Based on the
literature accompanying the scenarios, including the ninety-eight-page
publication "Scenarios: An Explorer's Guide," [these speculative
fictions inform decision-making aimed to maximize]{.mark} the
corporation's [profits and ensure]{.mark} its [survival]{.mark}.
Contestations over "the future" and "futurity" have been central to
formulations of time throughout the twentieth century and into the
twenty-first: from the scientific inquiries into the relations of space
and time carried out by physicists]{.underline}** such as Neils Bohr,
Albert Einstein, and others; **[to the theorizations of time offered by
philosophers and artists such as Henri Bergson, Martin Heidegger, and
Aimé Césaire]{.underline}** (which often contradict those advanced by
physicists); **[to the theories of modernity offered by political
theorists; to the rise of financial derivatives as part of a shift away
from the gold standard; and to the ways that film and other technologies
have transformed lived experiences of temporality]{.underline}**. Thus,
the strategies and assumptions that inform Royal Dutch Shell's futures
scenarios are antagonistic to those that animate Queer Times, Black
Futures, which centers some of the cultural logics of Afrofuturism. In
1994, Mark Dery tentatively defined Afrofuturism as "speculative fiction
that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American
concerns in the context of twentieth-century technoculture---and more
generally, African American signification that appropriates images of
technology and a prosthetically enhanced future."3 Over the past ten
years, an explosion of interest in Afrofuturism has transformed the
category itself, pushing its cultural logics and political investments
into the twenty-first century. Currently, Afrofuturism is a rich and
growing area of critical inquiry and cultural production, which includes
film and other visual cultural forms, literature, critical scholarship,
and audio culture. Its early definition, which influential scholar
Alondra Nelson, among others, credited to Dery, has been revised and
debated. Recently, Ytasha L. Womack offered the following definition in
her book Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and Fantasy Culture:
"Afrofuturism is an intersection of imagination, technology, the future,
and liberation."4 One of the aims of Queer Times, Black Futures is to
interrogate these four constitutive elements of
Afrofuturism---imagination, technology, the future, and
liberation---within the context of finance capital's stances toward (and
investments in) the future. Queer Times, Black Futures considers the
implications of scholarly, artistic, and popular investments in the
promises and pitfalls of imagination, technology, futurity, and
liberation that have persisted in Euro-American culture since the
beginning of the twentieth century. The Afrofuturisms of interest to
Queer Times, Black Futures consist of cultural forms and logics through
which creative engagements with Black existence, technology, space, and
time might be accessed and analyzed. Their conceptualizations of futures
differ from those through which Royal Dutch Shell and other
transnational corporations like it aim to ensure their existence. The
corporate use of scenarios to support profitable decision-making affirms
Kodwo Eshun's claim in his essay "Further Considerations on
Afrofuturism" that "science fiction is now a research and development
department within a futures industry that dreams of the prediction and
control of tomorrow."5 Eshun continues:

> **[[Corporate business seeks to manage the unknown through]{.mark}
> decisions based on [scenarios, while civil society responds to
> future]{.mark} shock through habits formatted by science fiction.
> Science fiction operates through the power of falsification, the drive
> to rewrite reality, and the will to deny plausibility, while the
> scenario operates through the control and prediction of plausible
> alternative tomorrows]{.underline}**.6

**[For Eshun, [the difference between]{.mark} the future scenarios
produced through science fiction and [speculative fiction]{.mark} genres
[and those produced by]{.mark} the [interdisciplinary teams assembled by
multinational corporations resides in the stance each takes toward the
present]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Science and speculative fiction writers
often produce future scenarios that the range of data available today
would deem impossible, or that fly in the face of reality and
plausibility. **[[Multinational corporations]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
conversely, **[[produce "credible, relevant, and challenging alternative
stories" that help managers make long-term decisions rooted in present
realities.]{.mark}7 By combining "different fields of knowledge and ways
of knowing," [corporate scenarios seek to ward off what]{.mark} John
Maynard [Keynes referred to as "uncertainty,"]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
thereby [mitigate the vulnerability and risks of unanticipated
events]{.mark} caused by blind spots, at least some of which, as I
discuss below, the Shell scenarios team attribute to the epistemological
limitations of disciplinary knowledge]{.underline}**.8 Royal Dutch
Shell's existence is predicated on a system of racial capitalism that
thrives on the dispossession and exploitation of Black people,
Indigenous peoples (some of whom describe themselves as "Black"), and
people of color. **[[A future]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
**[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}** Royal Dutch Shell **[[would continue to
exist as such forecloses]{.mark} upon a future in which those groups of
living beings we currently can identify as "[Black]{.mark} people"
[and]{.mark}/or [Indigenous peoples]{.mark}, have the resources to enjoy
a sustainable and joyful existence on this planet.]{.underline}** In
order to grasp the significance of Shell's speculative fictions about
the future, it is helpful to have a sense of its history, including the
environmental and human costs of its "strategic decisions." Royal Dutch
Shell was formed in 1907 after a merger between the British Shell and
the Royal Dutch companies. Shell began as a venture between Marcus
Samuel and his brother Samuel Samuel to control the oil trade in East
Asia; it was formally launched in 1897 as the Shell Transport and
Trading Company Limited.9 Royal Dutch was founded in 1890 by a Dutchman
named Aeilko Jans Zijlker, who, as a manager of the East Sumatra Tobacco
Company in the Dutch East Indies, found oil in northeast Sumatra in 1880
and convinced the Dutch authorities to support his efforts to extract it
and bring it to market.10 While Zijlker founded Royal Dutch, it was
Henri Deterding, another Dutchman, who later made it a profitable
enterprise. Shell began operating in the United States in 1912 and
claimed worldwide operation one year later with its expansion to
Venezuela. Venezuelan oil became an especially significant aspect of
Shell's holdings, and it "was with mostly Venezuelan oils that the
Allies fought the Second World War" on the European continent.11 The
arrangement depended upon the oil company's good relationship with
Venezuela's president at the time, a fascist dictator named Juan Vicente
Gómez.12 Although the Royal Dutch/Shell Group (as it was then known)
helped the Allies during World War II, even offering their dual
headquarters in England and the Netherlands (which remained neutral
during the war) to bolster the Allies' war efforts, Deterding made no
secret of his admiration for fascist dictators. He idolized Italy's
Mussolini and backed Spain's Franco and Germany's Hitler. Deterding
reportedly offered to cooperate with Hitler, a decision that ultimately
led to his ousting from his long-time leadership position.13 The history
of Royal Dutch/Shell underscores the distance between the company's
stated purpose with its futures scenarios and the reality of how their
profit-driven activities have impacted the peoples and ecologies they
use in the name of ensuring the future of Shell Oil. The history of
Shell's flirtation and collaboration with fascist dictators is sediment
within the present relations that sustain the oil giant's profitability.
These dealings contributed to Shell becoming one of the most profitable
oil companies in the world after World War II. By the 1950s and 1960s,
when post--World War II "economic growth throughout the industrial world
was powered by cheap oil," Europe was "the most competitive market in
the world," and "Shell was the leading European marketer."14 During that
time, Shell's explorers found oil in Nigeria after a roughly fifteenyear
search and set up an operation to extract it. The infamous events that
followed reveal the extent to which Shell's existence is predicated upon
its ability to exploit land, lives, and labor. The future scenarios
initiative at Shell began in 1970, when Shell was causing overwhelming
ecological destruction in the Niger Delta and perpetuating violence
against the Ogoni people who live there. Key staff on Shell's scenarios
team explain in a short video available on Shell's website that in the
1970s, they predicted "volatility in the world would rise" as a possible
result of the decision by Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela to
form OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) in
1960.15 Their **[speculation about a possible future that came to pass
enabled them to prepare for the volatility ahead of time and thereby
minimize its negative effects on their operations. But]{.underline}**
the **[[future scenarios did not prevent]{.mark} them from [extracting
resources from the Niger Delta]{.mark}. Royal Dutch Shell's operations
in Nigeria demonstrate one example of how [the company's industrial
practices have harmed the planet's ecosystem across the world,
*especially*]{.mark} *on [Black and]{.mark} other [Indigenous people's
lands]{.mark}*]{.underline}***.* Some of Shell's "strategic decisions"
over time have threatened the survival of both the land from which Shell
extracts its oil and those who live on it. By 1995, the Ogoni people had
organized themselves to use nonviolent means to achieve justice. One of
the most visible and outspoken Ogoni leaders was writer, journalist, and
leader of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP), Ken
Saro-Wiwa. About MOSOP's beliefs and motivations, Saro- Wiwa explained:

> MOSOP was intent on breaking new ground in the struggle for democracy
> and political, economic, social and environmental rights in Africa. We
> believe that mass-based, disciplined organizations can successfully
> revitalize moribund societies, and that relying upon their ancient
> values, mores, and cultures, such societies can successfully
> reestablish themselves as self-reliant communities and at the same
> time successfully and peacefully challenge tyrannical governments.16

MOSOP's effective nonviolent campaign drew international attention in
the early 1990s. In 1990, Saro-Wiwa wrote the first draft of the Ogoni
bill of rights. As Bronwen Manby describes: "In October 1990, MOSOP sent
the Ogoni Bill of Rights to then--military head of state General Ibrahim
Babangida, but received no response. In December 1992, MOSOP sent its
demands to Shell, Chevron, and NNPC \[Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation\], together with an ultimatum that they pay back royalties
and compensation within 30 days or quit Ogoniland."17 By 1993, citing
intimidation and attacks on its staff, Shell's operations in Ogoniland
were suspended, and state-sponsored and extra-legal violence had been
unleashed to stop MOSOP's nonviolent protests of Shell Oil's activities
in the Ogoni area, which resulted in the deaths of "hundreds of unarmed
Ogoni men, women, and children."18 After several previous detentions,
Saro-Wiwa and other members of MOSOP were forced into a detention center
in Port Harcourt in 1993. Writing from there, Saro-Wiwa claimed that
Shell was sponsoring the violent attacks against MOSOP. To this day,
Shell denies any involvement. On November 10, 1995, after a trial that
has been widely criticized as unfair, Saro-Wiwa and his eight
codefendants were hanged in Port Harcourt Prison. Shell Oil condemned
the executions. In 2009, "before the start of a trial in New York that
was expected to reveal extensive details of Shell's activities in the
Niger Delta," Shell settled with Saro-Wiwa's son, Ken Saro-Wiwa Jr., for
\$15.5 million dollars, claiming that it was a humanitarian gesture.19
As of August 2018, Shell Oil is worth US\$306.5 billion,20 and the
company has been widely regarded as a leader in "corporate
responsibility."21 Yet, in 2004, Shell rocked the global financial
market when it admitted that it had been overestimating its oil reserves
by "2.1 billion barrels in Nigeria and Oman, 1.2 billion in Australia
and Kazakhstan and 0.6 billion in other fields around the world."22 Some
commentators and observers placed partial blame for the deception on the
company's massive bureaucratic structure.23 The decision to overstate
the reserves by 41 percent was attributed to the leadership at the time,
and led to the replacement of three senior executives.24 Under
international pressure from activists and humanitarians after the
execution of "the Ogoni nine," Shell conducted an internal review and
updated its business principals to include "specific references to human
rights."25 In their first social responsibility report, published in
1998, the company stated: "We engage in discussion on human rights
issues when making business decisions. We have established a regular
dialogue with groups which defend human rights."26 Yet, Royal Dutch
Shell's **[[present existence has clearly depended upon]{.mark} their
[ability to wreak havoc on]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[if not
destroy]{.underline}**, **[the living conditions of [those who inhabit
the lands from which Shell extracts]{.mark} its profitable
[oil]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **["Corporate responsibility" is another
calculation to increase profit since Shell by no means plans to
redistribute its wealth]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to account for the
history that made it the one of the richest companies in the
world]{.underline}**. **[Under these circumstances, any likely future
for Shell justifies the violences it has inflicted. [The scenarios it
predicts for the future]{.mark}, therefore, [embed these violences and
obfuscate present possibilities]{.mark} for redressing and preventing
them.]{.underline}** Moreover, Shell's futures assume that Shell will
continue to extract whatever resources it needs. Presently, Shell's
interest in futures and future scenarios evidences its investment in its
survival as a corporate entity. While the taxi driver's tale blames
government policies, Shell Oil's own survival also jeopardizes the
survival of the planet and all living things insofar as its profits
continue to depend upon the exploitation and appropriation of land and
living labor. Since Shell Oil's future scenarios are of course designed
to speculate on futures wherein the company will continue to generate
profits, they do not include situations in which Shell Oil itself no
longer exists, is rendered obsolete, or has redistributed its wealth. As
such, Royal Dutch Shell's continued existence (since its inception in
the late 1800s) can be understood as part of the longue durée of a
modernity that, as I will discuss later in this introduction, was
***[[inaugurated by]{.underline}]{.mark}*** the
***[[colonization]{.underline}]{.mark}*** of the so-called New World,
the attendant **[[enclosure]{.underline}]{.mark}** of land, **[[*and
the* transatlantic *slave trade*]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Their
***[[future scenarios are part of a knowledge project that has been
calibrated to reproduce existing relations.]{.underline}]{.mark}***

**[[The mode of knowledge production that
animates]{.underline}]{.mark}** Shell's **[[future scenarios hinges upon
its understanding of]{.mark} the value of
[interdisciplinarity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Shell presents
interdisciplinarity as a significant method for fulfilling the role
played by speculative scenarios in its decision-making process, as
explained in its publication, "Scenarios: An Explorer's Guide":
**[[Scenarios address blind spots by challenging assumptions, expanding
vision and combining information]{.underline}]{.mark}** from many
different disciplines. Our experience, training, current fashions and
familiar ideas can strongly influence what we notice and how we
interpret the world. The positive view of these influences is that they
help us focus, but they can also create blind spots---whole areas we
know nothing about---leaving us exposed to unanticipated developments.
Expertise itself can, paradoxically, help to create these blind spots.
Information acquired from discipline-based research can create
fragmented learning.27 **[[The value]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Royal
Dutch Shell **[[of assembling]{.mark} "interdisciplinary"
[scenarios]{.mark} teams [consisting of experts from a variety of
fields]{.mark}, combined with their interest in using the story form [to
include relevant qualitative, nonquantifiable
information]{.mark}]{.underline}** in their scenarios, **[[calls
attention to the convergence of]{.mark} the [knowledge-production
apparatus of a controversial transnational corporation with]{.mark}
current [academic discourses]{.mark} and practices.]{.underline}**
**[Those include interdisciplinarity and collaboration]{.underline}**,
the tropes and creative operations of speculative and science fictions,
**[and the range of interests currently animated by imaginative
speculations on the future]{.underline}**. Here,
**[["interdisciplinarity" marks]{.mark} a mode of [knowledge production
that can meet the]{.mark} challenges and [demands of contemporary
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Heralded in some academic quarters as
a way to resist the governance of traditional disciplines,
"**[interdisciplinarity]{.underline}**," according to Shell Oil's future
scenarios team, **[is]{.underline}** also **[an emergent logic that
serves the current needs of Capital by calling attention to existing
"blind spots" created by disciplinary assumptions and]{.underline}**
their attendant methods of **[knowledge production.]{.underline}** As a
way to engage with the world that might direct attention to what Capital
has not (yet) taken into account, interdisciplinary and collaborative
scholarship emerges in accordance with the needs of finance capital. Yet
the difference between assembling a team of cross-disciplinary experts
and producing interdisciplinary fields and areas of study is worth
considering here. Talking specifically about the discipline of
economics, Lawrence Grossberg has argued that Cultural Studies ought to
take seriously the ways that interdisciplinary scholarship works to
transform disciplines.28 Grossberg asserts that scholars in Cultural
Studies have become "lazy" as a result of "the increasing tendency to
tame interdisciplinarity by incorporating it into and delimiting it
within the disciplines. Rather than taking on other disciplines,"
Grossberg writes, "we grab onto a body of literatures and paradigms that
have become transdisciplinary, so that they appear to liberate people
from disciplinary canons to some extent."29 It is debatable whether or
not this tendency can be diagnosed as a symptom of laziness, rather
than, say, the myopic modes through which scholarship is rewarded, at
least in the United States, if not elsewhere, through publishing
protocols and merit reviews that privilege the reproduction of existing
scholarly methods, paradigms, and assumptions. Such a debate would not
detract, however, from what is to be gained by pointing out, following
Grossberg, that the interdisciplinarity of Cultural Studies historically
has been predicated on a different model than the interdisciplinarity
that informs the assembly of Shell Oil's scenarios team.30 The
interdisciplinary drive of Cultural Studies, at its most impactful, has
been consistent with how Stuart Hall retrospectively described the
interdisciplinary activities of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural
Studies (CCCS), founded at the University of Birmingham, England in 1964
by Richard Hoggart. The CCCS, which closed in 2002, was the
institutional home of "the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies," which
notably included Stuart Hall. In an essay entitled "The Emergence of
Cultural Studies and the Crisis of the Humanities," also quoted in
Grossberg, Hall writes: Serious interdisciplinary work involves the
intellectual risk of saying to professional sociologists that what they
say sociology is, is not what it is. We had to teach what we thought a
kind of sociology that would be of service to people studying culture
would be, something we could not get from self-designated sociologists.
It was never a question of which disciplines would contribute to the
development of this field, but of how one could decenter or destabilize
a series of interdisciplinary fields. We had to respect and engage with
the paradigms and traditions of knowledge and of empirical and concrete
work in each of these disciplinary areas in order to construct what we
called cultural studies.31 The interdisciplinary work described by Hall
involves a sustained engagement with existing literatures in order to
construct another field. It could be characterized as a mode of
scholarly production that imaginatively, yet seriously, engages with
disciplinary and interdisciplinary areas' "existing paradigms and
traditions of knowledge" and "empirical and concrete work" to construct
a new scholarly terrain. Such an endeavor is calibrated to "be of
service to people studying" a particular object or set of objects, or to
those interested in specific questions; it creates ways to do that work.
It is animated by a scholarly imagination. As Hall explains, after the
critical, negative work that those who formed the CCCS did to distance
themselves and their work from some of the ongoing traditions in the
humanities, "the positive work one then went on to do in the Centre had
still to be invented."32 **[[The pulls toward interdisciplinarity can be
situated within a broader transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
described by Gilles Deleuze, **[[away from disciplinary societies and
toward "societies of control."]{.underline}]{.mark}** In a short essay
published in 1992 and entitled "Postscript on the Societies of Control,"
Deleuze argues, "**[[We are at the beginning of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
something." He describes it as **[[a]{.mark} widespread ["substitution"
of "mechanisms of control" for]{.mark} the ["disciplinary sites of
enclosure"]{.mark} that characterized]{.underline}** the **[prior
formations of power]{.underline}** described by Michel Foucault as those
of "disciplinary societies." **[The struggle over]{.underline}** the
transformation or destruction of **[the traditional academic
disciplines]{.underline}** in order **[to develop [interdisciplinary
sites of knowledge production]{.mark} can be understood as part of the
broader struggle against disciplinary societies]{.underline}**, **[which
[are animated by]{.mark}]{.underline}** the same **[[logics of
enclosure]{.underline}]{.mark}**.33 The **[[logics of interdisciplinary
knowledge production]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, also **[[are
consistent with]{.mark} aspects of the [mechanisms of
control]{.mark}]{.underline}** discussed by Deleuze in 1992. According
to him, in place of the enclosed spaces of disciplinary societies, which
"reached their height at the outset of the twentieth" century,
mechanisms of control have been accelerating since the end of World War
II to become the dominant logic of power. Deleuze writes,
"**[[Enclosures are molds]{.mark}, distinct castings, [but controls are
a modulation]{.mark}, like a self-deforming cast that will continually
change from one moment to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh will
transmute from point to point]{.underline}**."34 **[As]{.underline}**
the logics of **[disciplinary societies are increasingly
eclipsed]{.underline}** by those of control societies, **[[institutions
are being transformed]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[protocols and
methods]{.underline}]{.mark}** through which a variety of disciplines,
**[including disciplinary knowledge production]{.underline}**, have been
maintained over time **[[are subjected to modulation and
fluidity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Under present conditions,
interdisciplinary modes of knowledge production can work as a mechanism
of control.35 As such, they encapsulate a confrontation between
liberating and enslaving forces. Based on our examples of Shell Oil's
scenarios team and considering the importance of interdisciplinarity to
neoliberal university management logics, it could be argued that control
societies are substituting interdisciplinarity (practiced as what
Grossberg characterizes as transdisciplinarity, or assembling experts in
different disciplines in order to produce knowledge across those
disciplines) for disciplinarity.36 The logics and methods of
interdisciplinarity do not guarantee, nor do they inherently express,
liberatory or radically transformative knowledges. Yet, as Deleuze
asserts, "There is no need to fear or hope, but only to look for new
weapons."37 Because "the different control mechanisms are inseparable
variations," it must not be assumed, however, that the weapons available
to be found may not also be used to build the societies of control
themselves.38 In other words, interdisciplinary knowledge---that is,
knowledge that transforms the disciplines while creating other forms of
knowledge---might still be fashioned into a weapon directed against the
investment in interdisciplinarity as a strategy of control.

Security scientism and the propagation of permanent insecurity,"
Security Dialogue, 2-15-2012,
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0967010611430436

With the demise of communism as an overarching organizing principle and
crystallization point, [Western security doctrines have seen the
inclusion of a growing range]{.underline} [of different security issues
from political, societal, economic and environmental
sectors]{.underline}. By the same token, [Western security politics has
also **been prominently infused with risk narratives and
logics**]{.underline} since the 1990s (Petersen, 2011; Hameiri and Kühn,
2011). [Particular to risk-centric conceptualizations of public danger
is the]{.underline} [understanding that national and international
security should take into account]{.underline} a varied set of natural
or man-made disaster [potentials, as well as other probable]{.underline}
[disruptions with potentially grave consequences for
society.]{.underline} Also, [specific to these dangers is the **profound
uncertainty** regarding their **exact form** and likely
impact]{.underline}, [and the **substantial room for conflicting
interpretations surrounding them**.]{.underline}

However, [precise and 'actionable' knowledge of looming danger is
quintessential to security politics]{.underline}, the shift to new
security narratives notwithstanding. [Without conceptions of existing or
upcoming collective dangers, security schemes are neither intelligible
nor implementable]{.underline}. Whether the matter at hand concerns the
installation of hi-tech body scanners at airports, the construction of
avalanche barriers in the Alps or diplomatic initiatives for a global
anti-terror alliance, [any security]{.underline} [agenda is
rhetorically]{.underline} and politically [grounded in a representation
of **national** or **international danger**]{.underline}. In recent
years, [the epistemological foundations of security]{.underline}
[politics have been addressed by reflexive and critical approaches, a
literature that enquires into the formation]{.underline}, contestation
and appropriation [of (in)security discourses.]{.underline}

Situating itself in this broader literature, this article focuses on
national risk registers as a particular means for authoritative
knowledge definition in the field of national security. [National risk
registers are fairly recent, comprehensive inventories of public dangers
ranging from natural hazards to industrial risks and political
perils]{.underline}. Often produced by civil protection agencies,
**[they seek to provide secure foundations for public
policymaking]{.underline}**, security-related resource allocation [and
policy planning. **Evaluating** and **ranking** all kinds of **potential
insecurities**, from toxic accidents and political unrest to plant
diseases]{.underline}, thunderstorms, energy shortages, [terrorist
strikes, wars and the instability of global financial markets, risk
registers stand at the intersection of the **broadening of security
politics** and the **adoption of risk logics**]{.underline}.

This positioning notwithstanding, the topic of risk registers as
systematic ministerial attempts at authoritative definition of public
danger has received little to no attention in the security studies
literature -- or any literature, for that matter -- so far. Reflexive
security studies has focused on the creation of new danger narratives
for single cases such as migration or HIV/AIDS (Huysmans, 2000; Elbe,
2008), or on the rationalization of uncertainty through risk logics in
the distinct case of terrorism (Rasmussen, 2002; Buzan, 2006; Amoore and
De Goede, 2008). In other cases, it has also looked at the role of
sovereign decisions in the production of knowledge (Williams, 2003;
Aradau and Van Munster, 2007), the knowledge inputs of distinct security
professionals such as the police (Bigo, 1996), the limits of knowing in
particular (Daase and Kessler, 2007), or the role of science and
scientific data in the production of public danger notions more
generally (e.g. Büger and Villumsen, 2007; Villumsen, 2008). A recent
inquiry into catastrophic futures, too, has some interfaces to the world
of risk registers, though it deals more particularly with one specific
type of anticipatory governance characterized by 'radical unknowability'
(Aradau and Van Munster, 2011: 5).

In contrast to those contributions, [risk registers]{.underline} are not
about individual dangers, extreme risks or tipping points, but about
mapping the territory of national insecurity as broadly and
comprehensibly as possible. They [are governmental technologies for
making sense of a world that is seen to be so crowded with potential
security issues]{.underline} [that choosing the 'right' issues on the
basis of 'objective' and scientific criteria has become the prime goal
of security professionals]{.underline}, thus pushing to the background
discussions about how to actually deal with those issues. [National risk
registers]{.underline}, then, are also tools for dealing with
unknowability, or the limits of knowledge more generally, but they are
not about making particular unexpected events -- or catastrophes --
actionable and governable. Instead, they [are about the management
of]{.underline} [insecurity in the broadest sense]{.underline}, as [they
provide seemingly incontestable and neutral mechanisms by which danger
potentials can be **prioritized** in a **cost-effective
way**]{.underline}. In that sense, [national risk registers are an
integral constituent of a **larger politics of
insecurity**]{.underline}. Though connected to the politics of
catastrophe, they advance a different regime of knowledge and distinct
modes of governing.

Indeed, risk registers advance an analytical agenda that shapes the way
in which the larger organization of public danger is to be understood in
the first place, and they also define which authorities are entitled to
define danger on behalf of a political collective. [Risk registers are
hence situated in proximity to other domestic risk technologies and
strategies that seek to make the future calculable]{.underline}
(Hacking, 1990). However, such registers also differ in several ways
from the technologies employed by the 'managers of unease' (Bigo, 2005).
Most importantly, while the latter are mainly focused on identifying
potentially disruptive individuals or groups, [risk
registers]{.underline} [are interested in 'themes' of a diverse nature,
advancing a depersonalized and even]{.underline} **[dehumanized image of
security]{.underline}**. Also, [the type of knowledge]{.underline} that
is empowered by risk registers [is]{.underline} typically [not actuarial
or statistical in nature, but a type of **expert-generated knowledge
that is actively used to mask non-knowledge, and**]{.underline} that is
[complicit in **'feigning control over the
uncontrollable'**]{.underline} (Beck, 2002: 41).

The aim of this article is to introduce national risk registers and to
problematize the distinct ways of understanding and thinking about
security introduced by them into current Western -- or arguably European
-- security affairs. In doing so, [we identify and put into question
three elements of the larger security analytics with which these risk
registers are associated.]{.underline} The first element relates to the
specific type of knowledge that is valued, as well as the kinds of
authorities that are prioritized by risk registers. [While risk
registers pretend to recognize scientific inquiry as the supreme
authority for security knowledge construction, they in fact employ a
**glorified** form of **guesstimates** that is turned into **objective
security 'truth' in the process**. Through this '**knowledge-laundering
process**', risk registers **foreclose the possibility of contestation**
and **discount alternative views**]{.underline}.

[The second element is the registers' reliance on the 'conventional'
risk-analysis formula]{.underline}, [which assigns a numerical value to
a risk theme by multiplying the probability]{.underline} [of occurrence
by a figure for the potential impact]{.underline}. [Such a
rationalization of the future]{.underline} based on engineering
risk-assessment methodology [effectively **silences value questions**,
while]{.underline} at the same time advancing an analytical perspective
that competes with views emphasizing the malleability of future
trajectories. By making potential monetary loss -- in the form of
consequences or impact in the risk formula -- a central element of
policy prioritization, **[it empowers a security agenda based on crude
cost--benefit rationality]{.underline}**. [Marginalizing alternative
kinds of rationalities, **it effectively 'depoliticizes'**
**policymaking** in the security domain,]{.underline} [circumventing
debates about **other possible values, aims and measures**]{.underline}.

The third element pertains to the larger organization of insecurity.
Risk registers posit risk 'themes' rather than referent objects as their
analytical point of departure. In practice, this decision empowers a
homeland-centric security agenda in which public ministries define what
(and by implication, who) is to be protected -- an analytical view that
competes with both human subject-centric and more international security
perspectives. Not only are classic distinctions between international
and domestic issues reformulated; [risk registers also strengthen a
particular image of security based on a sense of all-encompassing
vulnerability]{.underline}. With this[, a sense of pervasive insecurity
emerges. The security agenda becomes marked by **constant mobilization**
for **emergency response** and object hardening]{.underline}, and
security comes to be seen as requiring our persistent, unwavering
dedication, even if a state of security can never be achieved.

War Scare, NATO and psychological warfare against the citizens of Europe
and North America

At the end of World War II, the defense Industries in the USA had been
faced with the choice of conversion and retooling the factories that
made weapons or continue the massive subsidies for the industries vested
in military and armaments production. The choice was eventually made to
embark on a propaganda war scare to justify the need for an expanded
army and it was in this context when [[NATO was conceived. To
**sustain** the]{.mark} WW II [**armaments enterprise**, there needed to
be a cycle of **war scare** and the **fabrication**]{.mark} and
**inflation** [of **threats**]{.mark} and enemies.]{.underline} It was
in this context that Lawrence D. Bell, President of Bell Aircraft
Corporation, in a statement to the U.S. Air Policy Commission Finletter
Commission) on September 29, 1947, stated that ["as soon as there is a
**war scare**, there is **a lot of money** available."]{.underline}
\[6\] According to Andrew Cockburn,

> "[The aircraft [corporations]{.mark} that had garnered enormous
> profits during the war on the back of government contracts had
> [discovered]{.mark} by 1947 that **[peace was
> ruinous]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Despite initial high hopes, the
> commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less
> accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there
> were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders
> from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations,
> while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers
> and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly." \[7\]

In the spring of 1948, the U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal and
top officials of the Harry Truman administration began to sound alarm
about a looming Soviet attack against Western Europe. It is now known,
from declassified documents, that the officials were aware that there
was no credible evidence to back up their war scare. Some analysts have
argued that [[the **war scare** of 1948 was devised to **save** the
**aircraft**]{.mark} manufacturing [**industry** from]{.mark} plunging
into **[bankruptcy]{.mark}**. [And this goal was
**achieved**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the book Harry S. Truman and the
War Scare of 1948, Frank Kofsky states that [within 2 months of the
emergence of the scare, the [Truman]{.mark} administration [**revamped**
the]{.mark} **aircraft [industry]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} embarking on a
57% **increase** in [purchase of **military
aircraft**]{.mark},]{.underline} and the total budget of the Pentagon
was increased by 30%.

[[NATO was born]{.mark} on April 4, 1949 [out of this **propaganda war**
to deceive]{.mark} the US [citizens about a **pending attack**]{.mark}
of the **Soviet Union** on Western Europe. [The task of

Agency. There are now so many books and articles on the role of the CIA
in deception, propaganda and psychological warfare that we will not
spend a great deal of time on the role of the Covert agencies in giving
legitimacy to the idea of a Soviet threat. Stephen Kinzer and David
Talbot are two writers who have documented extensively how the Dulles
brothers ensnared every major profession in the USA in this deception.

... The narrative of Western unity and the politics of collective
forgetting during the Cold War\
[One of the most influential narratives of international security put
forward by liberal IR scholars and practitioners centres on the
Euro-Atlantic security community, consisting of a group of countries
united around a set of key liberal norms and institutions that generate
"dependable expectations" of peaceful resolution of conflicts that might
arise among them]{.underline}.1 [From that perspective, **[NATO]{.mark}
is an institution that [was created]{.mark} in the context of the Cold
War [to protect]{.mark} [the pre-existing security community]{.mark}
[from the threats posed by the West's dangerous other]{.mark}: the
communist bloc**]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline}, as a series of
constructivist scholars have persuasively argued, [there is nothing
natural about the Western security community]{.underline}.2 In Emanuel
Adler's words, "[security communities are socially
constructed]{.underline} and rest on shared practical knowledge of the
peaceful resolution of conflicts."3 Furthermore, the absence of violence
should not lead us to conclude that the construction of security
communities in general and the Western community in particular were
power-free processes. On the contrary, as Adler and Barnett explain,
central to the establishment of a security community is the dialectic
between power---primarily symbolic power---and knowledge.4 Thus, in the
physically non-violent context of security communities, power is
primarily "the authority to determine the shared meanings that embody
the identities, interests and practices of states, as well as the
conditions that confer, defer or deny access to goods and benefits."5
[Applying this logic to the specific case of NATO, we can see the
alliance not as the institutional expression of a pre-given community,
but, rather, as an organization that has been deeply involved in
power-filled practices of construction and reproduction of that
community]{.underline}.6\
Historical evidence indicates that the founders of NATO---[policymaking
elites]{.underline} from the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States,
France, and the Benelux states---did not take the Western security
community for granted. Instead, they [engaged in a systematic set of
practices aimed at constructing a sense of community around a shared set
of liberal-democratic norms in the Euro-Atlantic area, and placed the
newly created North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the heart of those
practices]{.underline}. In the intergovernmental debates leading up to
the establishment of NATO, the threat of military confrontation with the
Soviet Union was regarded as less worrisome than the danger of communist
subversion within the weakened societies of Western European states.7 In
that context, as Louis St. Laurent---then Canadian Secretary of State
for External Affairs---argued, [[the best way to prevent a]{.mark} third
[world war]{.mark} [was]{.mark} [by confronting]{.mark} "[the forces of
communist expansion]{.mark} [with]{.mark} an [overwhelming]{.mark}
preponderance of [moral, economic and military force]{.mark} on the side
of freedom]{.underline}."8\
At the level of top Western political elites, the fear of communism
inspired a collective (re)definition of political identity in the
Euro-Atlantic area. The "spectre of Communism" provided the defining
other against which decision-makers on both sides of the Atlantic were
able to subordinate their differences to a collective definition of a
Western community. That community was seen as based on the common
heritage of political and cultural ideas of member states; its defining
mark was the set of shared values of individual liberal freedoms, the
rule of law, and democracy.9 This view is clearly reflected in the
preamble to the Washington Treaty (NATO's foundational treaty), which
stipulates that the alliance is based on principles of democracy,
individual liberty, and law.\
Contrary to what conventional (realist) wisdom suggests, NATO was not
simply set up as the hegemonic instrument of the US. On the contrary,
political actors from other states---most notably Canada---played key
roles in driving the process of establishing NATO and defining its key
foundational principles.10 In fact, one of the key articles in the
Washington Treaty is informally known as the "Canadian" article,
precisely in recognition of the influential role played by Canadian
policymakers in its formulation.11 Article 2 clearly shows that NATO was
expected to play a role that went far beyond that of a conventional
military alliance. That article succinctly summarizes the precepts of
the Kantian-inspired democratic peace theory, as it stipulates: "The
Parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and
friendly international relations by strengthening their free
institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of the principles
upon which these institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions
of stability and well-being."\
To decision-makers locked in a competition with forces regarded as
representing communist otherness, [[it was imperative that
countries]{.mark} of Western Europe, Canada, and the US [cultivate a
sense of]{.mark} [shared]{.mark} liberal-democratic [identity---**set in
opposition**]{.mark} [to communism]{.mark}---among their
peoples]{.underline}. In that context, they sought to articulate a
narrative of Western unity, and disseminate it as widely as possible in
the countries of the Atlantic Alliance. As Erik Ringmar has argued,
identities are constructed, maintained, and transformed via the telling
of "constitutive" narratives.12 Narratives provide a set of meanings
within which an actor's identity, the situation within which they are
located and the actions deemed appropriate are brought together.13 The
process of telling constitutive narratives is especially important
during periods of fundamental transformation, when new identities are
being formed and old ones are being pressured to evolve.14\
In the eyes of Western leaders, the narrative of unity among NATO
members had to not only cultivate a sense of shared identity, but also
to delegitimize---by casting them as inconsistent with Western
identity---communist forces that were becoming increasingly powerful in
many allied states. Once again, some of the most influential voices in
favour of disseminating a narrative of Western unity and using that to
legitimize community-building practices within NATO were its middle
powers---particularly Canada. For instance, the Canadian Foreign
Minister, Lester Pearson, repeatedly argued in the early 1950s that
NATO's long-term goal had to be the creation of a community of free
nations in the Atlantic area. More broadly, Canadian officials, together
with NATO supporters from Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and the UK,
were acutely aware of the fact that, in order for the alliance to be
able to help build "a community of free nations" united around liberal
values, [it had to find a way to help publics from allied states
transcend recent memories of war among Western states. What was
required, in other words, was [a collective
reinterpretation]{.mark}---and a selective forgetting---of the recent
past.15 After all, **[the newly identified enemy]{.mark}**, [communist
Soviet Union]{.mark}, [had emerged from the war as a hero]{.mark} in the
eyes of many in the West]{.underline}.\
[The view of the "West as one" became central to a collective
(re)reading of Western history following the establishment of the
alliance.16 [Collective efforts at history (re)writing]{.mark} found
expression not only within the public discourse articulated by NATO, but
also in confidential documents]{.underline}. Recently declassified
documents from the 1950s reveal a set of shared understandings among
NATO's decision-makers regarding the way in which the history of member
states should be interpreted in order to foster a sense of Western
community. [In addition, NATO mobilized its substantial material and
symbolic power to widely disseminate the discourse on Western unity in
all the allied states and, simultaneously, to delegitimize alternative
readings of history---especially those that focused on ideas of
solidarity---and memories of friendship---with the Soviet
Union]{.underline}.17 In particular, as Patrick Jackson has
demonstrated, the discourse of Western civilization played a key role in
orchestrating the collective (re)reading of Germany as a member of the
Western community, and on this basis legitimating its incorporation into
NATO. This is not to suggest that the West was an essential entity that
objectively determined a field of outcomes. Rather, "Western
civilization" needs to be understood as "rhetorical commonplace," used
by allied policymakers as a discursive resource for de-legitimating
policy options opposed to Germany's incorporation into American-led
institutions.18 In the official NATO discourse, Germany was interpreted
as a member of the Western family that, under the Nazi regime, had
temporarily deviated from its core values. Following the end of that
regime, however, (West) Germany---acting under the close supervision of
allied states---could and should be reintegrated into the Euro-Atlantic
community.\
Against the background of the constitutive discourse on Western unity,
disagreements and tensions that continued to occur among member states
could be represented as "family" feuds, and managed within the framework
of shared norms and a persisting sense of community. A full analysis of
inter-allied disagreements during the Cold War is beyond the scope of
this paper. However, it is worthwhile to briefly examine what could be
seen as one of the most significant set of disagreements within NATO:
arguments concerning the accession to the alliance of states that did
not comply with the liberal-democratic norms and values around which the
Western community defined itself. Particularly interesting were
arguments over the inclusion of Portugal in 1949, as well as the
accession of Greece and especially Turkey (completed in 1952). In that
context, middle powers like Canada and Norway emerged as strong
proponents of the view that countries which did not respect basic
liberal-democratic values did not belong---and should not be
included---in the alliance which represented the Western community.19
[In the end, however, all the [allies]{.mark} [were persuaded to support
the inclusion of]{.mark} those ["problem" countries]{.mark}. Several
factors were crucial to the emergence of that consensus: a shared
recognition among the allies of the geostrategic importance of those
countries in the context of growing confrontation with the Soviet Union,
and a sense that, in that particular context, [the inclusion]{.mark} of
strategically vital but normatively deviant states [was]{.mark} an
[acceptable compromise **in the name of protecting** the community of
liberal values]{.mark}]{.underline}. The prevailing view came to be that
the integration of states like Portugal and Turkey could be managed in a
way that would not necessarily endanger the core values of the West.
Furthermore, inclusion into the Western community was seen by some
allied policymakers as a course of action that could help those
countries evolve into stable liberal democracies. It is revealing, in
fact, that a normative compromise that was eventually seen as reasonable
in the cases of Portugal and Turkey was regarded as inappropriate in the
case of a country whose political regime was perceived as an active
threat to liberal-democratic values: Franco's Spain.20 As Mark Smith put
it, "[Turkey could be accommodated, and Portugal's dictatorship had less
Fascistic origins than Spain's. Significantly, **neither had a history
of active antagonism** toward Western European liberalism]{.underline}.
Admitting Franco would be admitting a regime of the very sort that had
overturned European democracy in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was
wholly unacceptable."21...

[... The West imagines European security in terms of NATO]{.underline}.
The West is a generic term, as is NATO, for what John Searle describes
as collective intentionality in the actions of a number of
governments.58 Whereas the West is a collective identity that shapes the
actions of certain governments on a wide range of issues, [NATO has
become the pivot of Western security]{.underline}. It institutionalises
a collective identity at the same time as it provides the military and
political infrastructure for its member governments to act in concert.
[Following the end of the Cold War, [NATO reaffirmed its identity as a
collective intentionality]{.mark} [that furnished the ends as well as
means for Western security]{.mark}.59 NATO thus provides an opportunity
for studying the Western praxeology of security]{.underline}. The next
section will sketch how NATO embodied the rules of the modern security
praxeology, and how it became the pivot of rule-altering politics after
the Cold War.\
Strategy and Security\
In the late eighteenth century the concept of strategy came to define
'questions of force' in terms of means-ends rationality. Strategy was to
define 'war's conduct as a "science" whose principles could be
discovered, laid down in a "system", and taught in the military
academies that were just beginning to open their doors'.60 No one has
defined the modern conception of strategy better than Carl von
Clausewitz. Raymond Aron points out that Clausewitz's theory is a
praxeology.61 'War', Clausewitz famously asserted, 'is simply a
continuation of political intercourse with the addition of other
means'.62 By arguing that war was a means to achieve political ends,
Clausewitz sought to define the rationality of war rather than its
'grammar'.63 War has a meaning shared by no other form of violence (for
example a bar brawl) because it is defined as a means to ends beyond the
acts of violence themselves. The purpose of war is to use military means
for political ends.64\
Politics is 'nothing in itself', Clausewitz argued, 'it is simply the
trustee for all these interests \[of the state\] against other
states'.65 As war, politics was a means to an end. In the twentieth
century the political ends served by strategy were defined by the
concept of 'security'. Security conceptually integrated a number of
'interests' into a coherent strategy for how a state should act. This
process gained momentum in the wake of the Second World War. It was the
concept of 'national security' that came to define Western strategy
during the Cold War.66 It is important to note that compared to previous
conceptions, 'national security' was a very 'broad' concept. As the US
National Security Council pointed out in its NSC68 report, in 'times of
apparent peace' security was not merely a matter of military
capabilities. According to NSC-68, the military stalemate made it
necessary to 'make ourselves strong' in socio-economic and ideological
terms. Victory was to be an achievement not only of American society but
also of the power of American ideals.67\
The New Strategic Environment\
[The Cold War created a strategic environment with little space for
transformation. By limiting states' possibilities of action it
entrenched the means-ends rationality of 'national
security']{.underline}. One indication of this is that academic interest
in the concept of security faded during the Cold War, but forcefully
returned in the 1990s.68 At that time, the West believed that the world
of NSC-68 had disappeared. '[The monolithic, massive and potential
immediate threat' of a Soviet attack had vanished, NATO asserted in its
Strategic Concept of 1991.69 This was, in the words of President
Clinton, [a 'moment of panoramic change, of vast opportunities and
**troubling threats'**]{.mark}.70]{.underline} [The end of the Cold War
removed almost every one of the threats mentioned in NSC-68, the threats
which warranted the concept of 'national security'. However, **[the end
of the Cold War did not mean the end of security policy]{.mark}**.\
[Nowhere was the concept of 'national security' more constitutive than
in NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore many, if not most, security
experts expected NATO to disappear with the end of the Cold War and
'national security' (and some still do).71 If the Alliance was to carry
on, it was argued, it would be through bureaucratic inertia or to insure
the safe passage to a new security order.72 The opposite has happened:
[[NATO has become the pivotal institution in constructing a new]{.mark}
European [security architecture]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most importantly,
perhaps, [the construction of the new security architecture has to a
considerable extent been achieved by constructing [a new]{.mark}
reflexive [conception of security]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO has not
only reinvented itself; it has provided a Western forum for reinventing
security.\
NATO has come to understand itself as a rule-altering institution.
'[[The new strategic environment']{.mark}, NATO Secretary General Lord
Robertson argued in the Mounbatten Lecture at the University of
Edinburgh, '[offers]{.mark} us a unique luxury; [the opportunity to set
the security agenda ourselves]{.mark}. And setting the agenda is what
NATO of the 21st century is all about']{.underline}.73 Thus **[[the
organisation is actively reconstructing the terms of its own
existence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One of Beck's central ideas is that
constructivism is not only a philosophy of science but a characteristic
of our times: NATO is clearly in a time of construction. In that sense,
it lives up to the characteristics of reflexive modernity. An important
part of reflexivity is the selfawareness brought about by reflection on
one's ability to construct one's own terms of existence. NATO defines
itself by the constructive character by which it has set a new security
agenda.\
[[It is as an agent of constructivist politics]{.mark} [that the
Alliance finds its legitimacy]{.mark}, and therefore it opposes other
constructions of what NATO is about.]{.underline} 'NATO remains
frequently misunderstood---its character as well as its policies', Lord
Robertson complains; 'too many observers still tend to judge NATO by the
outdated yardsticks of the Cold War'.74 Struggles of definition (or
discourse), and the symbolic politics they entail, are central to NATO's
own understanding of its purpose. Though its image is a matter for its
spin-doctors to construct, the ways in which NATO imagines security and
security agency in the post-Cold War world is immensely important for
security studies.\
[NATO has been used as the forum for establishing a Western consensus on
the security issues of the post-Cold War world. Most important to this
process have been the two 'strategic concepts' of 1991 and 1999, which
served to establish a common ground between Western governments on how
to conceive not only NATO's new role but also the security environment
in which the Alliance should operate]{.underline}. In the following, I
will therefore take my point of departure primarily from NATO's
strategic concepts in order to briefly outline the post-Cold War
construction of security. Analysis of these concepts shows that not only
does NATO's self-conscious constructivism illustrate the heuristic value
of Beck's concept of reflexivity, but that the concept of security NATO
is constructing is based on a notion of risk that fits Beck's
theoretical framework in a very successful manner.75 ...

#### NATO's definition of security was [purposefully written]{.underline} to allow it to [constantly change]{.underline} what qualifies as a "threat" because its [existence]{.underline} is predicated on security

... Security Challenges and Risks\
[Since 1991, **[NATO has defined the object of security]{.mark}**---what
is to be spotted, stopped, resisted and used---as 'security challenges
and risks']{.underline}.76 [This redefinition is a self-conscious break
with the past and forms the basis for the construction of a new
praxeology of security]{.underline}. In Beck's terms, it exemplifies
'rule-altering politics'.77 This is a type of politics one might refer
to as constructivist, as it seeks to redirect policy by changing the
entire conception of the environment of action. According to NATO, the
new security environment is completely different from the past. The Cold
War focused NATO in one direction and made the Alliance focus
exclusively on the resources need to defeat the Red Army. '[[In
contrast]{.mark} with the predominant threat of the past', NATO argued
in 1991, '**[the risks to Allied security]{.mark} that remain
[are]{.mark} [multi-faceted]{.mark} in nature [and
multi-directional]{.mark}, [which makes them hard to predict and
assess']{.mark}**.78]{.underline} The new security policies NATO has
constructed to deal with this new environment can be described through
the concepts of 'management', the 'presence of the future' and the
'boomerang effect'.\
'Management': A Work in Progress\
'[Security in the Cold War was essentially about things we didn't want
to happen']{.underline}, Lord Robertson argues.79 NATO fought the Cold
War by constructing a defensive security structure. [Following the end
of the Cold War, [NATO has turned institution-building into an offensive
strategy of 'rule-altering' politics]{.mark}. By making itself the
institutional centre of European security, [NATO has sought to
manage]{.mark} the [transformation]{.mark} of the Cold War system. [It
has used]{.mark} the [enlargement]{.mark} of its own institutional
sphere [to define the rules]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [the new European
security system]{.mark} in ways the Alliance believes will guarantee
peace]{.underline}.\
By inviting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to join the Alliance
in 2000, NATO committed to a radical enlargement of its membership.
Furthermore, NATO has placed itself at the centre of a number of
institutions and cooperation arrangements (Partnership for Peace, North
Atlantic Cooperation Council, etc.) that include most European states.
Furthermore, [it goes to great lengths to stress the historical
continuity of these two strategies of institution building.]{.underline}
'The Alliance', as the 'Strategic Concept of 1999' explains, 'has
striven since its inception to secure a just and lasting peaceful order
in Europe'.80 What has changed, according to NATO, is the environment in
which its vision of peace is to be realised.\
[Central to NATO's conception of the conditions for security agency in
the post Cold War world is the notion that there exists 'an environment
of continuing change']{.underline}.81 To NATO, this transformation is
the result of the Alliance's victory in the Cold War.82 The Alliance has
a reflexive approach to its victory, however. [By constructing our era
in reflexive terms, NATO does not advocate that the post-Cold War world
offers the possibility of pursuing clearly defined ends, achieved by
means of the organisation itself. [NATO has not set a new end for
itself;]{.mark} [it has established]{.mark} a number of
[guidelines]{.mark} [by which it can **manage the transformation of the
present**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, NATO policy follows
Beck's recipe for political agency in reflexive modernity. The
enlargement process shows this clearly.\
Perhaps not surprisingly, the real debate about NATO enlargement did not
take place at the Madrid Summit in 1997 when the decision on who should
join the Alliance in the first round of the enlargement process was
taken. The discussions in Madrid were portrayed as an objective
evaluation of the applicants' ability to join, and the decision reached
was thus presented as the closure of the subject. The fact, however,
that so much emphasis was placed on the need for a new round of
enlargement suggested that the Madrid meeting itself was an act of
symbolic politics, which was merely a signpost in a much larger
process.\
The decision on enlargement was a true act of constructivist politics.
With the Study on NATO Enlargement, and the discussions within the
Alliance that surrounded it, NATO defined the conditions under which a
country could join: any future member state should be well on its way to
becoming a democratic society and should be in a condition to contribute
to the security of the Alliance as a whole.83 In spite of their
vagueness (or perhaps because of it), these rules defined the
enlargement process. They enabled NATO to reject a number of applicants
in the first round of enlargement, but they also enabled applicants to
keep the process open. In order to manage this process, NATO has
increasingly sought to provide 'objective' rules for when a state can be
admitted into the Alliance. Thus, in 1999 NATO launched the Membership
Action Plan (MAP), which has created a process of consultation and
evaluation through which states that seek membership may improve their
military capabilities, while NATO can gain insights into their ability
to meet Alliance standards.84 Beck discusses these kinds of technocratic
strategies in relation to environmental regulation, where the limits of
pollution are defined by scientific arguments that claim secure
knowledge in situations where there can only be reflection.85 The same
is true of NATO enlargement. MAP only disguises the fact that the
question of who should become a member is a political decision. NATO
readily acknowledges this; perhaps because of MAP's attempt to
'objectify' enlargement has provided at least some applicants with a
discourse through which they can convincingly argue in favour of their
membership when their military reforms are going well.\
Enlargement is a reflexive process because its rules make NATO reflect
not only on the nature of the Alliance but also on the characteristics
of Western society. [The criteria for joining NATO are, for all their
vagueness, essentially requirements for 'Western-ness']{.underline}. For
that reason, enlargement has been inevitable. In the early 1990s, the
Eastern Europeans successfully portrayed their societies as 'Western'.
As NATO defined itself and its 'enduring' mission in terms of defending
a 'common heritage and civilisation',86 Václav Havel could convincingly
argue that '\[i\]f the West does not find a key to us, who were once
violently separated from the West\...it will ultimately lose the key to
itself'.87 The key of Western identity is to lock the door to the past.
'[Protecting peace in a new Europe' in effect meant managing the new
Europe]{.underline}. [[The Alliance's repeated emphasis on
'stability']{.mark} must be seen in that light.]{.underline} [[Because
the present is defined by transformation, doing nothing means losing
control]{.underline}]{.mark}. In terms of the ship metaphor of
governmentality, enlargement was regarded as the only way to steer
Europe away from the rocks of the Cold War. Without it, the West feared
that a wave of instability might push Europe backwards. In the words of
Secretary General Javier Solana, '\[m\]anaging Europe's benign
evolution\...is after all NATO's key role today'.88\
[[NATO had to alter the rules of security policy]{.mark} in order to
play that role. Thus NATO has broadened its conception of
security]{.underline}. [In the 'Strategic Concepts' that the
organisation publishes regularly, [NATO commits itself to '**a broad
approach to security**]{.mark}, which recognises the importance of
political, economic, social and environmental factors in addition to the
indispensable defence dimension'.89 Such a broad concept of security has
enabled NATO to realise its ambition of stabilizing the peace achieved
with the collapse of the Soviet Union.]{.underline}\
This policy demonstrates how constructivist politics can change the
content of concepts by placing them within a different understanding.
Adopting a broader concept of security, NATO appropriated ideas designed
in the 1980s as alternatives to NATO's approach to security.90 From
NATO's own perspective on the way the times had changed, however, this
was quite natural. Faced with the 'monolithic' threat of the Red Army,
NATO had focused on military security. [Now, 'managing the diversity of
challenges facing the Alliance requires a broad approach to
security']{.underline}.91\
While [[this broad concept of security]{.underline}]{.mark} was
originally designed to make NATO obsolete as the foremost provider of
Western security, it [[is now used to export NATO's]{.mark}
[services]{.mark}, making the Alliance the centre of European
security]{.underline}. [[Institutions]{.mark} [like]{.mark} the
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe
([OSCE]{.mark})---which were explicitly intended to build security
through the deliberative and inclusive strategies associated with the
broad concept of security in the 1980s---[have been marginalised]{.mark}
[because]{.mark} [they are regarded as being unable to provide]{.mark}
the **[enforcement capabilities]{.mark}** needed by the
West]{.underline}. In NATO, [[the broad concept of security]{.mark}
[provides]{.mark} [a praxeology for the active enforcement of Western
security]{.mark} rather than deliberation over different security
considerations]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[widening the concep]{.mark}t
of security has [permitted NATO enlargement]{.mark} [to be constructed
as a]{.mark} [security necessity]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[The new
European order holds many diverse threats in need of
'management']{.underline}]{.mark}**. The broad concept of security has
become the key whereby the West has opened the door of a new security
order with NATO at the centre. As the very purpose of this order is to
manage transformation, it holds an inherent impetus for continued
expansion of the NATO framework. [In the words of Lord Robertson,
'\[s\]ecurity in Europe remains a work in progress'.92 **[Reflexivity
offers no end]{.mark}**. NATO's example shows that one reason for this
is that [the policies needed to manage the problems at hand **produce
awareness of yet other problems**.]{.mark} [The broad concept of
security continually presents new security issues to
manage]{.mark}]{.underline}. As we shall see in the section on the
'boomerang effect', this has forced the West to face some hard choices.

... The 'Presence of the Future': Proliferating Threats\
In the West, [the end of the Cold War was constructed as the beginning
of a new era, where a peace would reign. In this construction, however,
**[peace did not entail the end of security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As
described above, [[NATO has expanded its concept of
security]{.underline}]{.mark} [and engaged in much more active security
policies]{.underline}. These policies led to its first major military
engagement, against Yugoslavia during the Kosovo Crisis in 1999. How did
a time of 'peace' become the scene of such an active security policy?
The answer lies partly in the argument above: [[the broad concept of
security has made NATO regard the post-Cold War world as a time of
security challenges]{.mark}. Equally, however, [NATO's construction of
the present]{.mark} as a time of transformation [has focused its
attention on the threats of the future]{.mark} rather than on the peace
of the present]{.underline}.\
Proliferation is the catchword of insecurity in the age of risk society.
**[[Proliferation describes the accumulation of a threat across
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The construction of a risk depends on a
scenario that constitutes a 'real virtuality' in Beck's terms.
[Proliferation describes the logic in that scenario whereby [minor
problems of the present are constructed as major threats of the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}.\
David Mutimer points out that in the course of the 1990s [the issues
signified by 'proliferation' have expanded dramatically]{.underline}.
From signifying the stable control of nuclear weapons in the hands of
the five original nuclear powers, proliferation has come to refer not
only to the spread of other weapons of mass destruction but of any
threat that spreads. Mutimer shows how the concept of proliferation
control is even applied to the 'war on drugs'.93 Again, **[[it is the
future that makes these issues security concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
It is not the establishment of a nuclear facility in North Korea that
poses a threat, but the prospect of North Korea having a nuclear
capability. It is not the production of coca, and perhaps not even drug
abuse in the US that poses a problem, but drugs' long-term destabilising
effect on Latin American countries and their effect on crime and social
stability in the US.\
[**[NATO applies the proliferation discourse to European
security]{.mark}**, and [from a proliferation perspective]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [time of peace is more precarious]{.mark} than if it had
been constructed in the terms of NSC-68.]{.underline} [NATO operates
against three types of 'proliferation'. Firstly, NATO focuses on the
'spilling over' of 'serious economic, social and political difficulties'
in 'countries in and around the Euro-Atlantic area']{.underline}.94\
Secondly, the conception that not only Europe but the entire planet is
in a process of transformation towards a more globalised world has
convinced the Alliance that it has to 'take account of the global
context'. In a globalised world, conflicts from faraway countries can
proliferate into the West by means of terrorism or organised crime.
Furthermore, the disruption of the flow of vital resources need not only
refer to oil but to a vast quantity of other goods and services from
around the world that globalised economies need to function.95 Finally,
NATO identifies 'the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical
(NBC) weapons and their means of delivery' as 'a matter of serious
concern'.96 These constructions of proliferation erode the distinction
between 'the North Atlantic area' and the area beyond. NATO needs to go
farther afield in order to maintain its security in a changing,
globalised world. [Proliferation temporalises the broad concept of
security]{.underline}. [[The broad concept of security
identifies]{.mark}, for example, [economic or social crises as security
issues. **Proliferation outlines how these security problems might
become the West's security problems**]{.mark} **in time**]{.underline}.\
Furthermore, proliferation may be regarded as the negative manifestation
of the constructivist politics of risk society. From this perspective,
'management' can be regarded as benign, guided mechanism of
proliferation. The enlargement process is a means of proliferating the
institutions that NATO believes to have brought peace and security for
fifty years across the European continent. It is guided by a scenario
envisaging how all of Europe can develop into a security community like
the West. However, not all European countries need to join NATO at once.
[The process of enlargement itself will proliferate security throughout
the European system, or so the West hopes]{.underline}.97 Thus, the West
is painfully aware that security is not the only possible outcome of
enlargement. An alienated, hostile Russia is another eventuality that
greatly concerns NATO. It is this 'boomerang effect' that is the subject
of the next section....

#### NATO's existence is predicated on the response to threats -- its [redefinition]{.underline} of security allowed it to further expand after the Cold War and is the only reason it can continue to exist

...Conclusions\
[[By defining the post-Cold War security environment in terms of
'security challenges and risks']{.mark}, [NATO]{.mark} has engaged in
constructivist politics. It [has]{.mark}, thus, [provided a forum in
which the rules directing Western security policy have been
redefined]{.mark} in terms of 'management', the 'presence of the
future', and the 'boomerang effect']{.underline}. **[[NATO has imagined
itself as the agent of change in the post Cold War
era]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Its means of facilitating]{.mark} change
[has been through the broadening of the concept of
security]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This has placed it at the centre of a
cobweb of security issues, interests and institutions.]{.underline}
NATO's function has become the weaving of this web into a stable
security structure for the twenty-first century. [[It is the 'presence
of the future' that has made this]{.mark} very active security policy
[necessary]{.mark} [in the eyes of the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[The West has regarded,]{.mark} in
turn, [this time of peace from the perspective]{.mark} [of a broadened
conception of security]{.mark} [because]{.mark} [it]{.mark}
[believes]{.mark} that [peace can only be maintained if]{.mark} every
contingency in [the proliferation of threats is
managed]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} NATO's constructivist policies
have presented the West with several 'boomerang effects'. Nonetheless,
enlargement was carried through in spite of fears of alienating Russia.
Just as NATO seemed to have managed that risk, it felt compelled to
intervene in the Kosovo Crisis, risking its precarious relationship with
Russia. In that sense, NATO's 'management' of the Kosovo Crisis clearly
shows the 'risk trap' the West faces. Western policy in the 1990s has
created so many 'boomerang effects' that NATO's window of opportunity
has become very narrow indeed on a number of issues central to the
West.\
[[Security]{.mark}, therefore, [is no longer what it was]{.mark} during
the Cold War]{.underline}. A decade after the end of the Cold War this
might seem a trivial point. Still, most studies of international
security analyse the changes in quantitative terms. [[There are fewer
threats to 'spot']{.mark}, the argument goes, [and therefore agencies
like NATO must concentrate on less important threats in order to justify
their existence]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This line of argument
overlooks the fact that the rules by which security issues are 'spotted'
and the measures taken to stop threats have been transformed. The
construction of these new rules has been pivotal to structuring European
security; including the central role NATO has come to play in this
structure. Security studies needs an understanding of agency that does
not overlook these developments. This article's central purpose has been
to suggest that Beck's notions of risk society and reflexive modernity
offer a way of appreciating these new rules of security policy.\
If security studies is entering a 'sociological era', as Bill McSweeney
suggests, it is because the practice of security policy is transforming.
Only by appreciating the present societal context is one able to account
for contemporary security policies. Risk society and international risk
society ought to be understood as two sides of the same coin: a new,
reflexive praxeology. It is important to note that this era of
late-modernity defines a process of transformation rather than an
entirely new departure. Therefore, elements of past and present
practices exist side by side in a reflexive relationship. [This is
evident, for example, in the way NATO defines its policies both as a
continuation of its 'enduring purpose', and as a new practice of
security that views the Russian approach to security
'outdated']{.underline}.\
This article has focused on NATO in order to illustrate the heuristic
value of Beck's concepts of reflexivity. Thus, the article has pointed
to the creation of an international risk society, but it has not argued
for its existence. Such an argument would, on the one hand, have to
focus on the processes Beck himself describes; processes which are
eroding the nation-state, most notably, globalisation.113 At a time when
the rules of world politics are being altered by governments, it would
be interesting to investigate the extent to which new possibilities open
for what Beck refers to as 'sub-politics', that is, politics outside the
traditional political arena conducted by new types of political agents
(for example social movements, groups championing environmental causes,
and NGOs).114 ...

I revisit herein the campaign to amend the "EASA Statement on the

of the EASA statement to cast light on possible futures in social
anthropology's debates and in order to make a case for anthropology as
an anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, cosmopolitan and anti-war
discipline. EASA's statement on the Russian war and the protest campaign
to rewrite it On the 26th of February 2022, [two days after Russia's
invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine, the [EASA]{.underline} executive
committee (EASA EC) [published a statement]{.underline} 'EASA Statement
on the Russian war against Ukraine'. While in the context of atrocities
its value is symbolic rather than practical, the EASA EC must be
commended on the swiftness of their response and the clarity of their
stance against the war and imperialism. The first two paragraphs of the
statement are particularly strong: The Executive Committee of the
European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA) condemns the
Russian government's illegal and unprovokedmilitary invasion of Ukraine:
an imperialist war that is leading to immeasurable suffering and losses
for the Ukrainian people, whose dignity, well-being, and independence we

GoogleDocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHjtoczfboEF55eqQRkVpaCJSyBq3cz3F5MeufV3u2s/edit)
and started gathering signatures. They explained in earlier versions of
the petition that if EASA did not retract the wording by noon on Monday,
14th March, they would feel 'morally obliged' to go public with the
petition. As EASA EC changed the wording, the petition was never widely
circulated. The style of the protest itself is quite stunning as it
features moralistic-conservative language ('controversial ideas'),
forces the executive committee to decide over a weekend, and in many
ways [resembles wartime Realpolitik]{.underline} (the initiators speak
of 'kind appeals' but set conditionalities and prepare to escalate
further, justifying such their steps with reference to morality). But it
is the content of the protest that interests me here. As the authors of
the petition explain: [While we fully agree that the war against Ukraine
has roots in Russian imperial ambitions, we reject the suggestion that
Russia's armed aggression is caused by NATO expansion into the Eastern
European territory]{.underline}. Such a statement would imply that
sovereign countries of Eastern Europe do not have the right to join
international alliances unless Russia approves, justifying Russia's
colonialist and imperialist claims over countries in Eastern Europe. As
anthropologists, we understand Ukraine's defensive actions as resistance
against the reactionary empire and recognize the right of people of
sovereign states to decide on membership in international alliances.
[The sentence]{.underline} \[this refers to the final sentence in the
EASA EC statement quoted above; M.F.\] also [contains a deeply troubling
ambiguity]{.underline}---[referring to Putin as "main aggressor" implies
that there are more aggressors in this war than Putin]{.underline} and
Russia, [assigning the blame for the war against Ukraine]{.underline}
(even asymmetrically) [to another party]{.underline}. **[Don't mention
the North-Atlantic Treaty Organisation]{.underline}** The "ambiguity"
raised by the last point can be debated. On the other hand, most EASA
members are not native speakers of English and thus there may always be
ambiguity in written English statements from the organization. But I
believe, it is clear from the statement condemning "Russian government's
illegal and unprovoked military invasion" in the opening sentence who is
the aggressor. It is, however, the arguments made in the first three
sentences which are particularly striking. I ask the readers to take a
look at the first two paragraphs of the original EASA statement quoted
above again. [How could a mention of NATO's role in the longer history
preceding the invasion imply that sovereign countries do not have the
right to join international alliances unless Russia
approves]{.underline}? What [logical somersault was performed
here?]{.underline} Does the protesters' problem with EASA EC's statement
lie in the word "roots"? Do the protesters read this as equivalent to
"the cause"? [It is certainly not a marginal position to argue that
Putin's actions are framed in geopolitical terms]{.underline} ([where
the key agents are the US and
China](https://lefteast.org/against-russian-imperialism/)) [and that the
West has not really tried to "[inscribe Russia in a more comprehensive
security agreement and all of the bilateral and multilateral
agreements](https://jacobinmag.com/2022/03/ukraine-socialist-interview-russian-invasion-war-putin-nato-imperialism?mc_cid=c9f7fa9edd&mc_eid=2ece385425)]{.underline}".
It is [also not a marginal position to point out that NATO policies have
made Russia's invasion more likely]{.underline}. Moreover,
pronouncements about [Ukrainian membership in NATO]{.underline} (or in
the European Union) had been [merely symbolic]{.underline}. Even
countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) had never truly supported
Ukraine's membership until now (geopolitics, in other words), [leaving
it in a particularly vulnerable position]{.underline}. In no way,
however, does acknowledging ["the geopolitical confrontation between the
US-led liberal "empire", and the Russian imperialist project in East
Europe](https://www.theasa.org/publications/asaonline/articles/asaonline_0111.shtml)"
mean that Ukrainians are mere puppets without desires, hopes and agency,
who should not freely express their will on which international
alliances their country should enter, without a fear of becoming targets
of military invasion. Of course, [most Ukrainians have no time and
patience for such debates now]{.underline}---their country has been
brutally attacked and the fight against the Russian invaders is all that
matters to them. In this sense, it is good that the EASA EC removed the
final sentence of the statement to avoid a social media storm that would
have followed with the publication of the petition and which would have
detracted from the statement's overall message. But let's be clear here:
[there was no ambiguity]{.underline} in the original statement. The
ambiguity was created by the initiators of the protest. Unless, of
course, [for anthropologists]{.underline} [it is inconceivable that one
can support the independence and sovereignty of Ukrainian people while
seeing Russian tsarism and NATO enlargement as shaping the context of
the invasion.]{.underline} But there is a danger that [**knee-jerk
ascriptions of culpability** and contests over the moral high ground
**will weaken our capability to take a critical view** of ourselves,
**and to** understand how our activities **contribute to fascism and
militarism**.]{.underline} NATO in CEE The choice presented by the
protest initiators is straightforward: if the EASA EC statement
mentioned NATO as an actor shaping geopolitical contexts, it would go
against Ukraine's right of self-determination. [This]{.underline}, to
me, [is **a whitewashing of NATO**]{.underline}. It is
[striking]{.underline} that [it comes from anthropologists who must know
that **the pro-NATO position was never**]{.underline} unequivocally
[**embraced by Ukrainians.**]{.underline} This is why, Volodymyr Arthiuk
explains, ["a silent majority" elected]{.underline} [Zelensky
who]{.underline} ["[promised to end the war, to not press issues of
identity and
language](https://jacobinmag.com/2022/03/ukraine-socialist-interview-russian-invasion-war-putin-nato-imperialism?mc_cid=c9f7fa9edd&mc_eid=2ece385425)."]{.underline}
[And while for reasons of bare survival under occupation,]{.underline}
[[support for NATO membership, or at least for a closer
cooperation](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/eng/news/2022/03/20/7136284/),
increased among Ukrainians]{.underline} in comparison with the pre-war
period, [these views will continue to be in flux]{.underline} and are
regionally specific. As regards Ukrainians' political opinions, one must
also wonder [what it will be in the
future](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/record-number-ukrainians-support-joining-eu-backing-nato-membership-falls-poll-2022-04-05/),
given how [NATO has **failed** to come to their defence]{.underline}.
[Equating NATO membership unproblematically with popular
sovereignty]{.underline}, with "the right of people of sovereign states
to decide on membership in international alliances", [is even more
**disingenuous** coming]{.underline} from CEE scholars, as in most CEE
countries there were [no referendums about NATO
membership]{.underline}---there was no popular decision. And while in
Poland or the Baltic countries, the majorities would have probably been
in favour, even Václav Havel was against the referendum in
[Czechia]{.underline}, since the opinion [polls were far from
conclusive]{.underline}. In [Slovakia]{.underline}, another country that
I know well, [[barely 50% supported membership]{.underline} in
2003](https://www.focus-research.sk/archiv/suhlas-nesuhlas-s-clenstvom-slovenska-v-nato/?fbclid=IwAR2L1Uqoeg9Ctu7D3t-aEtIkmLe9i2C4Dy_Arj5mvUsCO7ODDE3pmXWCClc)
when the country joined the alliance. Continued ambivalence of these two
countries to [NATO]{.underline} can be seen, for instance, in
demonstrations against the installation of tracking radar and kinetic
missiles in Czechia. Although politicians ar[gued these would protect
from attacks by rogue states,]{.underline} such as Iran,
[the]{.underline} [[public overwhelmingly (68%) rejected
them]{.underline}](https://original.antiwar.com/zoltan-dujisin/2007/12/19/nie-bolsters-czech-opposition-to-us-radar-base/).
In Slovakia, [just prior to the invasion,]{.underline} [[more people
blamed NATO than Russia for the
escalation](https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22831087/poll-slovaks-blame-nato-and-the-us-for-tension-on-ukrainian-border.html)
of the tensions along Ukraine's borders.]{.underline} The petition was
initiated by eight anthropologists -- seven Polish and one Slovak (see
'[Protest
initiators](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UHjtoczfboEF55eqQRkVpaCJSyBq3cz3F5MeufV3u2s/edit)').
The petition now claims to speak for an "international anthropological
community", whereas the EASA website speaks of an initiative by "EASA
members" that stimulated the change. Since the petition with signatures
was never publicised, I must suppose that the executive committee
decided to change the wording of the statement following the email from
the protest initiators. A predominantly CEE character of the initiative
is further reflected in the online social life of the petition: most of
the signatures come from Poland, Slovakia and Czechia. And while a
public campaign was stopped short by the EASA EC changing its statement,
any momentum for obtaining a critical mass for the protest would have
emerged from within this region. In this way, the narrative of the
protest echoes important discussions about the position of Central and
East European anthropologists within the discipline, in which many
signatories of the protest letter have been taking part actively.
However, **[consider the irony]{.underline}** it leads to: a group of
CEE anthropologists led by former **[members]{.underline}** of EASA EC
end up **[defending NATO]{.underline}** against EASA, [which they imply
is **a Western hegemonic institution misunderstanding the
region**]{.underline} (even if it is currently presided over by a
Bulgarian). Such positioning undoubtedly added to the pressure on the
EASA EC, since it suggested that EASA's statement was denying
sovereignty to Ukrainians and to peoples of other "sovereign countries
of Eastern Europe", **[legitimising Russia's imperialist
claims]{.underline}**. [We must be wary of]{.underline} such
east-[Europeanising re-alignments in the context of the prevalent view
of Ukraine in many CEE countries as a failed state between Central
Europe and Russia;]{.underline} [**the** **racialisation** **of
Ukrainians** **as cheap** and thus exploitable, also sexual, labour, but
'white' (good migrants and even refugees!).]{.underline} Likewise,
[it]{.underline} [is important to critically reflect on the grading
of]{.underline} [Europeanness in the]{.underline} CEE [public sphere,
where NATO and EU membership have been constructed as its unambivalent
symbols.]{.underline} It would also be misleading to say that all CEE
anthropologists found EASA's original statement to be "the dangerous
distortion" that the protesters saw it to be. Many disagreed, or would
have disagreed, if they had been aware of the protest, and if not with
the content of the protest, then with its tone. Indeed, there was a
lively discussion on the mailing list of the Czech Association for
Social Anthropology (CASA), with voices pro and contra. In the end, only
a few members signed the petition. Of course, some were probably waiting
for EASA EC's response, while others might have thought this whole thing
ridiculous, since, as one member put it, and I paraphrase, "Ukrainians
need guns, not statements." In any case, it shows that the options
presented by the protest initiators as clearcut were not wholeheartedly
embraced by all. [The need for anti-militarism]{.underline} Let's be
honest here. Rather than an argument about popular sovereignty,
[the]{.underline} initiators' [position is a pro-NATO]{.underline}
[one.]{.underline} It [pr**esents a false dichotomy: if one is against
Putin, one cannot be against NATO**]{.underline}. To be sure, I
understand where this position comes from. The feeling among many people
in CEE, including my parents, confirmed by the invasion, can be
summarised in the following way: [only NATO membership protects our
countries from becoming prey to Russia's tsarist ambitions; it is
therefore only NATO that enables people in member states to be safe and,
by extension, CEE anthropologists to pursue our careers]{.underline}.
Certainly, [**such an argument is counterfactual,** a]{.underline}s the
[world]{.underline} [where]{.underline} CEE [countries would not be NATO
members would be a different world. Precisely]{.underline}
[because]{.underline} [any]{.underline} line of [argument about the
absence of NATO]{.underline} membership [must remain counterfactual it
invokes both fears and desires, and in its operation must reproduce
legitimising narratives.]{.underline} These are things anthropologists
should be mindful of. **[The argument]{.underline}** is also problematic
as it [**separates NATO's past interventions and invasions from its role
as a defensive alliance** through which smaller states can protect
themselves]{.underline} against an imperialist next door.
[Violence]{.underline} [elsewhere]{.underline} (e.g.,
**[Yugoslavia]{.underline}**, **[Afghanistan]{.underline}**,
**[Libya]{.underline}**, and with Turkey as a NATO members conducting a
war against the **[Kurdish]{.underline}** population within its borders
and in [**Syria**)]{.underline} and often [**against** a]{.underline}
threat of "[tribal]{.underline}" [or **racialised**]{.underline}
"**[savage]{.underline}ry**" (Pierre 2013: 548) are treated in isolation
from peace and European values at home. [**This** compartmentalization
is understandable]{.underline} in the context of Russian imperialist
warfare, [but it **leads to** simplistic listing of pros]{.underline}
(NATO as a national-level ally against Russian colonialism)
[and]{.underline} cons (**[continued militarisation
internationally]{.underline}**; '[humanitarian
interventions']{.underline}), which is [a sophisticated
approach]{.underline} [[to neither the history of
imperialism](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/03/pros-cons-british-empire-balance-sheet-history-imperialism.html)
nor to a critical anthropology of military alliances]{.underline}. As
anthropologists[, **we must**]{.underline} resist such a
compartmentalization. Our discipline must [**be** anti-colonial,
anti-imperialist, cosmopolitan and **anti-war,** even though it is
always practised from a specific locale]{.underline}, such as CEE. [We
must reject simplistic Manichaeism,]{.underline} labour against
provincialism, and [r**eject seeing anthropologists as Putin's
apologists, just because they are critical of NATO** and of their own
countries' role in it.]{.underline} Furthermore, the above line of
argument promises only war; **[it extends Russia as a threat into the
past with only war and crisis on the horizon]{.underline}**. One must
wonder [how such "truths]{.underline}" (constructed through the piling
up of historical analogies, which are now in vogue) **[skew
anthropological sensibility]{.underline}**, especially in and about
Central and Eastern Europe. Gregory Bateson (2000: 265), among others,
showed how our truths, premises and habits of thought recursively
[reinforce our understanding of the world]{.underline} and of ourselves,
which **[leads further to the petrification of these truths. Against the
real threat of securitisation in European anthropology, I suggest we
promote an anti-war anthropology]{.underline}**, a part of a broader
anti-war movement. To [break the militarist habit of
thought]{.underline} we should become **[apprehensive of how militarism
and militarisation shape research topics and field sites]{.underline}**
(Gusterson 2007). We should also proceed as if we knew that the forever
war (as a problematic, not static ontology) was the ground on which we
stand and from which we speak as anthropologists. [This task is more
urgent now]{.underline} when [countries]{.underline} are
[increasing]{.underline} their military [spending]{.underline} or when
some argue for [the need to destroy Russia]{.underline} in a long-term
war, with the suffering borne by Ukrainians. We might [find inspiration
in abolitionist anthropology]{.underline} and rethink European
anthropology as [a speculative]{.underline} [analysis]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} not only [critiques the existing order]{.underline},
but in [a]{.underline} **[move of counter-war imagination, reimagines
and---through collective practical effort---reinvents the
possible]{.underline}**, "past the ruins of the world (and the
discipline) as we know it" (Shange 2019: 10). Two final comments The
fact that Putin clearly broke international law and the Russian army has
been committing war crimes should not make us blind to the fact that
**[the war has been going on in Ukraine for eight years preceding the
invasion.]{.underline}** As anthropologists [we must recognise the
complexity]{.underline} of that situation. This [does not make us
Putin's apologists]{.underline}. In fact**[, the real
problem]{.underline}** from the point of view of the discipline **[is
the way]{.underline}** European anthropology **[chooses which 'events'
it notices:]{.underline}** while we have had discussions on Brexit and
COVID (e.g., dossiers in Social Anthropology and two [series of
articles](https://www.focaalblog.com/?s=Brexit) on
[FocaalBlog](https://www.focaalblog.com/?s=covid)), [the war in eastern
Ukraine---with 14,000 casualties]{.underline} between 2014 and
2021---**[was never the focus of critical discussion]{.underline}**
(e.g., no dossier or EASA-sponsored roundtable, not even by the protest
initiators). Turning to the internal politics of EASA, it is important
to note that many members would want the association to function as a
learned society that abstains from activism and politics. For them,
EASA's past activities related to
[HAU](https://easaonline.org/newsletter/74-0819/hau.shtml),
[precarity](https://easaonline.org/publications/precarityrep), and
possibly also the open letters published by the current EASA EC signify
an unwelcome ideological move to the left. It is ultimately EASA members
who will decide on this in the future elections. I, personally, am proud
to be a part of an association that published such a strong anti-war
statement on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Organising biannual
conferences, publishing a journal or facilitating various topical
networks is not enough.

**[L -- Hybrid War -- Russia]{.underline}**

\*\*\* "HW" is hybrid war

This article theorises [the relationship between geopolitics and anx-
iety]{.underline} and uses this conceptual argument to analyse and
[critique the discourse of 'hybrid warfare'.]{.underline} Conceptual
works on the link between geopolitics and anxiety are scarce, despite
contemporaneous appearance of the claims that we are experiencing (yet
another) 'return of geopoli- tics' (Auer, 2015; Guzzini, 2012, 2016) and
that 'we live in anxious times' (Eklundh, Zevnik, & Guittet, 2017, p. 1;
Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020; Zevnik, 2017b[) in academic]{.underline} and
public [debates. We fill this gap by introducing the notion of anxiety
geopolitics as a type of affective discourse that emerges to relieve the
subjects from the uprooting experience of anxiety by anchoring both the
self and the alleged source of danger within a familiar 'mental
map'.]{.underline} However, [as]{.underline} [anxiety]{.underline} [can
never]{.underline} [be]{.underline} fully [resolved]{.underline} or
repressed, [discursive fixes]{.underline}, including geopolitical ones,
[are always temporary]{.underline} [and]{.underline} eventually
**[failing]{.underline}**. We contend that anxiety geopolitics is an
ultimately ambivalent, Janus-faced way of 'writing global space' ( ́O
Tuathail, 1996), in which [anxiety is both repressed and reproduced
through geopolitical discourses.]{.underline} In making these arguments,
we build upon and contribute to multiple literatures in political
geography and international relations. First, conceptualising
geopolitics as a discourse through which global politics becomes
spatialised, we borrow from the canon of critical geopolitics. We follow
especially the more recent turn towards affective geopolitics,
understanding affects as intertwined in the process of discursive con-
struction. So far, anxiety has received only rare attention in this body
of work (an exception is G ̈okarıksel & Secor, 2020), a gap this article
ad- dresses by theorising the role of anxiety in geopolitics in detail.
Second, in adopting the argument that construction of identity
narratives is a way to manage anxiety and make sense of the world, we
engage with the IR literature on ontological security. Yet, conversely,
this body of work has dealt with geopolitics only scarcely (Browning,
2018; Guzzini, 2012, 2016), and these rare studies rely on a
reductionist notion of anxiety. For these purposes, we reach to a third
literature, namely the work on the political dimension of anxiety
embedded (mostly) in Lacanian social theory. We then utilise these
theoretical arguments to analyse and critique 'hybrid warfare' (HW), one
of the key security discourses of our time. To start with[, it is not
easy to find out what HW is supposed to mean exactly, as there are many
varying definitions of the interchangeably used notions of 'hybrid
wars', 'hybrid threats' or 'hybrid campaigns']{.underline} (for a
magisterial conceptual discussion see Fridman, 2018). Most of them
[typically label]{.underline} some form of [combination]{.underline} of
'[military and non-military as well as covert and overt
means']{.underline} of conflict (NATO, 2019). This is usually followed
by **[long lists of disparate examples]{.underline}**. According to one
EU definition, hybrid threats 'range from **[cyberattacks]{.underline}**
on critical information systems, through the **[disruption of critical
services]{.underline}** such as energy supplies or **[financial
services]{.underline}**, to the undermining of **[public trust in
government]{.underline}** institutions or the deepening of **[social
divisions']{.underline}** ( European Union, 2018). In this logic, HW
[targets]{.underline} **[a wide range]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
pre-existing social issues, political cleavages and [security
vulnerabilities]{.underline}, while [seeking]{.underline} **[to amplify
and exploit them for the benefit of the attacker.]{.underline}**
[The]{.underline} covert and [psychological character of such form of
attack]{.underline} [then appears to be **particularly
worrying**]{.underline}, as 'hybrid campaigns' are '[designed to be
difficult to detect or attribute' so as to 'create
confusion']{.underline} (European Union, 2018) and '[sow doubt in the
minds of target populations']{.underline} (NATO, 2019). Clearly, such
definitions of HW are **[so broad that they can encompass almost
anything]{.underline}**; '[any possible combination of military and
non-military means]{.underline}' or even **['any possible hostile
activity']{.underline}** as has been argued elsewhere (Fridman, 2018, p.
155). Consequently and in line with approaches rooted in critical
geopolitics, we do not provide an authorita- tive definition of our own.
Instead, we focus on how HW is used in discourse to produce certain
(geo)political effects. Apart from being a highly relevant problem, HW
also presents a particularly fitting case to be analysed as an instance
of anxiety geopolitics. First, the close link between HW and anxiety has
been explicitly recognised by Maria M ̈alksoo, who shows how
[HW]{.underline} [triggers 'anxiety about the difficulties of
concretising **unknown and indetermi- nate threats**]{.underline}**'**
(M ̈alksoo, 2018, p. 378). Second, the [relation between HW and
geopolitics is at the same time strongly pronounced]{.underline} and
marked by a profound tension. On the one hand, HW ostensibly [departs
from a 'modern']{.underline} geopolitical [imagination]{.underline}
based on territorial states and borders ( ́O Tuathail, 1998). After all,
it is about [information operations in deterritorialised]{.underline}
spaces of the globalised public sphere, [unattributable]{.underline}
cyberattacks carried out [by non-state groups]{.underline}, or the
incitement of hor- izontal protest movements discontent with the present
political order. On the other hand, this 'postmodern' geopolitical
imagination (ibid.) has been very often subdued to the much more
traditional and 'modern' vision of a 'new Cold War' between Russia and
'the West' (for critical analyses of this discourse see Browning, 2018;
Ciut ̆a & Klinke, 2010; Toal, 2017). Thereby, [HW]{.underline} has been
[incorporated into the civilisational mode of]{.underline} geopolitical
[thinking that divides the world]{.underline} [along]{.underline} [an
East/West axis]{.underline}. Approaching HW as a case of anxiety
geopolitics allows us to analyse this tension and unpack the underlying
puzzle: [Why is it that the ostensibly novel, networked and
deterritorialised phenomena associated with hybrid warfare get so easily
submerged under such an old, static and territorial geopolitical
imagination?]{.underline} We argue that [the allure of East/West
geopolitics lies in its familiarity]{.underline}, as it provides [a
well-worn map]{.underline} that pr[omises to 'make sense' of the
anxiety-inducing manifesta- tions of 'hybrid warfare']{.underline}. Yet,
we also show that [these attempts even- tually fail]{.underline} and the
**[HW discourse ends up perpetuating the insecurities and anxieties,
which it was supposed to resolve]{.underline}**. As such, [it serves
well to **'a 'hybrid-industrial complex'** of government agencies,
think-tanks, non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and pundits' that
emerged around it]{.underline} (Galeotti, 2019, p. 11). By pointing out
to the role of anxiety geopolitics in this economy of power/knowledge
that emerged around HW, this article provides both an analysis and a
political intervention. The article proceeds as follows. First, we start
by a theoretical dis- cussion, crafting the notion of anxiety
geopolitics by developing and connecting insights of the literatures on
critical geopolitics, ontological security, and politics of anxiety.
Second, we argue that the [amalgam- ation of the hybrid warfare
discourse and East/West geopolitics]{.underline} presents a particular
case of anxiety geopolitics, which [oscillates between the promise to
repress anxiety and the **repeated failures in doing so.**]{.underline}
This is illustrated by examples from Czechia, a country considered as
playing a pioneering and outsized role in the European HW debate (Daniel
& Eberle, 2021; Jankowicz, 2020), which offers plenty of empirical ma-
terial for developing our theoretical argument and drawing some more
general implications. By way of conclusion, we discuss the broader
take-aways for critical geopolitics and IR, as well as for policy
debates on how (not) to address the threat posed by Russia. 2. Anxiety
geopolitics: space, affect, and ontological insecurity Our research is
located in critical geopolitics, from which we borrow the understanding
of geopolitics as discourses and practices through which people
''spatialize' international politics and represent it as a 'world'
characterized by particular types of places, peoples and dramas' ( ́O
Tua- thail & Agnew, 1992, p. 192). Critical geopolitics focuses on how
political events are articulated as somehow related to or driven by
geographic phenomena, or how issues are 'geopoliticised', that is
constructed as geopolitical problems (Cadier, 2019, p. 71). These ideas
are best captured by the concept of geopolitical imagination:
'Geopolitical imaginations are the result of subjects' attempt to make
sense of the world by associating political values with various parts of
that map. They can also be spoken of in the collective sense, in which a
group can be said to have similar (if ultimately unique) visions of the
world.' (Dittmer & Dodds, 2008, p. 447) More recently, critical
geopolitics has paid increased attention to affects and emotions (G
̈okarıksel & Secor, 2020; Laketa, 2019; Müller, 2013; Pain, 2009).1 Such
affective geopolitics explores how affects are an indivisible part of
social construction of space, as they are intimately entangled with lan-
guages and images through which our 'mental maps' are produced and
disseminated. Summarising this broader argument, Laketa argues that
geopolitics should be understood 'both as socially produced and
intimately experienced' and, consequently, 'the emotional and the
affective become the site of the geopolitical' and vice versa (Laketa,
2019, pp. 156, 160). Therefore, international politics is spatialised
also by engaging subjects at the affective level, which is an essential
part of the production of geopo- litical imaginations through which
subjects view the world and their place within it. This links critical
geopolitics to a range of literatures that deal with the relationship
between identity, emotions and affects, including the scholarship on
ontological security and anxiety in IR. The rapidly growing literature
on ontological security is concerned with how subjects -- individuals,
groups, or states -- deal with the un- certainty of modern life without
losing the 'security of the self, the subjective sense of who one is'
(Mitzen, 2006, p. 344) that defines ontological security and makes life
bearable. Building mainly upon the work of Anthony Giddens (1991),
classical contributions agree that ontological security is sought
through an active process of constructing the self and anchoring it in
the social world, which happens through the establishment of routines
(Mitzen, 2006), creation of biographical nar- ratives (Kinnvall, 2004;
Steele, 2008; Suboti ́c, 2016), or maintenance of relationships
(Berenskoetter & Giegerich, 2010). The key underlying purpose of
ontological security-seeking is to avoid anxiety, which Gid- dens,
following Freud, understands as an elusive and paralysing 'generalised
state of \[\...\] emotions' that is different from fear (Giddens, 1991,
p. 44). Fear is 'a basic emotion directed at a specific object that
prompts an adaptive response: fight or flight.' (Kinnvall & Mitzen,
2020, p. 241). In contrast, 'anxiety is diffuse, it is free-floating:
lacking a spe- cific object', which makes it possible to 'pin' it to
different things and concepts (Giddens, 1991, p. 44). Repressing the
elusive anxiety by this 'pinning', which transforms it into the
manageable fear of something, is then one of the key motives of human
behaviour. As anxiety is consid- ered overwhelming and paralysing; the
'chaos' that 'threatens on the other side of the ordinariness of the
everyday conventions' (1991, p. 37), subjects often prefer to deal with
it through the production of fear via 1 The terms affect and emotion are
often used interchangeably. We follow scholarship that sees affect and
emotion as placed on a continuum, where af- fects signify amorphous
bodily moods that are difficult to describe, whereas emotion refers to
states that are already reflected upon and linked to culturally embedded
and actionable categories like anger or love (Hutchison & Bleiker,
2014). In this sense, anxiety is an affect, while fear is an emotion. J.
Eberle and J. Daniel Political Geography 92 (2022) 102502 3the
discursive construction of 'specific objects and threats' (Chernobrov,
2019, p. 39). This involves reaching to well-worn identity discourses,
which serve as vehicles for '\[t\]ransforming the anxiety of the unknown
into the security of the known (recognizable, even if illusory) \[that\]
affirms the identity of the perceiving subject and enables it to confi-
dently interact with the international other.' (ibid.) These arguments
have a direct purchase for critical geopolitics, as geopolitical
imaginations are good examples of how such sense-making and
anxiety-managing discourses can look like. Some have already recognised
and developed this link. For Guzzini, the 'revival of geopo- litical
thought' in Europe is directly linked to ontological insecurity stemming
from 'the sense of disorientation and foreign policy identity crises
which followed 1989.' (Guzzini, 2016, pp. 14--15) Making a more explicit
link between anxiety and fear, Browning develops a very similar
argument: 'The attraction of tropes of a new Cold War and a return of
geopolitics is precisely that they solve anxiety about current events by
fitting them into clearly established systems of meaning, though doing
so entails reducing anxiety by emphasising a world of threats and fears'
(Browning, 2018, p. 113). Both Guzzini and Browning are critical of
using geopolitics as a tool of anxiety management, citing its adverse
effects both in normative terms (creation of enemy-images, building an
exclusionary 'Fortress Europe'), and in the consequential decrease in
physical security (e.g. as a result of escalating tensions between
antagonists locked-in in their hardened identities). However, both also
appear to ground their argu- ment in the assumption that anxiety
ultimately can be managed (more or less) successfully, one that is
shared by the Giddensian mainstream of ontological security studies.
While scholars making such arguments would consider the price of
anxiety-management via geopolitics as too steep, they still accept that
such a trade-off can be made in the first place and that one's
ontological security can in fact be gained at the expense of physical
security or the well-being of others. As some of the most recent debates
in ontological security scholarship recognise (Browning, 2019; Cash,
2020; Gustafsson & Krickel-Choi, 2020; Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020;
Rumelili, 2020), these issues stem from Giddens' problematic con-
ceptualisation of anxiety that is adopted by most ontological security
work in critical geopolitics and IR. To sharpen the analysis of the role
of anxiety in geopolitics and deepen the critique made by Guzzini and
Browning, an additional theoretical step is needed. For this purpose, we
reach to the literature on the politics of anxiety drawing mainly on the
work of Jacques Lacan, a psychoanalyst whose ideas have been
increasingly prolific in IR (for an authoritative overview see Zevnik &
Mandelbaum, 2021), and, to a lesser extent, critical geopolitics
(Klinke, 2016; Laketa, 2019; Müller, 2013). Our approach shares the
Giddensian notion that anxiety is an inarticulable, traumatic and
potentially paralysing affect that subjects attempt to avoid and
repress. However, instead of seeing it as merely something that 'lurks'
behind as the dark other of normal life, anxiety is understood as a du-
rable affective condition interwoven in everyday experiences as well as
social processes and political institutions. It doesn't just lurk, it is
always already there, as it is present in the key mechanisms that hold
society together: in the production of social subjects and the creation
of rules through which these are regulated and bound together. In this
reading, anxiety is correlative to the very emergence and existence of
the subject as such. It is 'a type of expectant dread' or 'a crushing
experience of 'out of placeness'' that arises 'when the subject, unable
to ground themselves in either a functional horizon of values or a
reliable social or subjective identification, fears that they might be
somehow swallowed up, devoured' (Hook, 2015, pp. 117, 119). It is less
about the disorientation and uncertainty caused by one particular crisis
(e.g. Russia invading Ukraine, Covid-19 arriving) and more about being
reminded of the ultimately irreducible fragility of all things,
including human lives and social orders. In this sense, anxiety is an
affect linked to experiencing the limit of one's own existence as a
subject, something that signifies the encounter with 'the real', to use
the Lacanian term for the internal limit of social order and/or the
biological limit of human existence. Anxiety can never be fully managed
or repressed, as it is a reaction to being confronted with what is for
Lacan the ultimate reality of human existence: the fundamental
'groundlessness of meaning' (Balaska, 2019, p. 25) and, therefore, the
impossibility of ever achieving a coherent and stable identity. In this
sense, anxiety is the affect that 'does not deceive' (Lacan, 2014, p.
160), as it does not cover over the void at the heart of every social
identity, but rather confronts us with it at the level of bodily
sensation. To put it differently, subjects are always ultimately
ontologically insecure, as no narratives, routines or re- lationships --
personal or geopolitical -- can ever fully deal with the omnipresent
possibility that things may not make sense and everything can break down
any minute. Anxiety emerges as the affect that signifies 'the need for
the stabilisation of the subject' (Burgess, 2017, p. 29), yet this
stabilisation is doomed to fail in the longer term. Therefore, in
contrast to readings that see it as an aberration, anxiety is
omnipresent, even though it clearly varies in its intensity across time
and space. Sometimes it is experienced more often and more strongly,
while there may be other, less anxious times (Solomon, 2012 makes this
argument with respect to affects in general). The current social condi-
tion is arguably one when anxiety is on the high; leading some authors
to argue that we are now living in an 'anxious society', 'a society on
con- stant alert, despite having no identifiable existential threat.
Instead, there is the constant presence of the possibility of that
threat, and with it, the sense that government cannot fully protect the
people and that danger resides in the everyday' (Kinnvall & Mitzen,
2020, p. 247, emph. added; Eklundh et al., 2017). Such (highly) anxious
society was created by the congruence of a range of factors. Some point
to the effects of neoliberalism and austerity that produce the
widespread feelings of powerlessness and loss of control (Hirvonen,
2017). Others focus on the social media economy that requires users who
are constantly obsessively checking for news updates, notifications and
the affective gratification coming from 'retweets' and 'likes' (Davies,
2019). For yet others, the proliferation of anxiety is connected to the
societal changes linked to gender, race and immigration (Ali & Whitham,
2018; Klinke, 2016; Zevnik, 2017b), or the 'security creep' perpetuated
by discourses and practices of counterterrorism and cybersecurity
(Heath-Kelly, 2018; Jacobsen, 2020). This extended understanding of
anxiety as ontologically conditioned and socially circulated 'nervous
states' (Davies, 2019) without a clear and concrete referent object
opens the possibility to think (geo)politics of anxiety in broader and
arguably more critical terms than in conven- tional ontological security
literature. On the one hand, the Lacanian approach broadly agrees with
the Giddensian ontological security framework with respect to how
subjects try to deal with anxiety: by 'pinning' it onto an object and
transforming it into a more tangible fear of something. In this manner,
'fear becomes a way of easing anxiety; of attaching a signifier (an
object of fear) to what is otherwise an un- founded experience of
unease' (Zevnik, 2017a, p. 237)

Such '[politics of fear']{.underline} then [transform]{.underline}s [the
crushing and paralysing experience of anxiety into the management of
'concrete objects that we have invented']{.underline} (Hir- vonen, 2017,
p. 261), such as the geopolitically coded '[Muslim terror-
ists']{.underline} or '[Russians hackers']{.underline}. In this step,
[anxiety]{.underline} is ostensibly [eased or repressed]{.underline} [by
the production of (geopolitical) narratives that '**make sense'** **of
the unpleasant experience by giving it a name and placing it on a
map**]{.underline}.2 On the other hand, however, the Lacanian take
allows us to account also for the politics that is imminent in the
failure of these anxiety- managing attempts. As we have argued, all
narratives built around 2 There is nothing natural about the
construction of particular fear objects, [be it]{.underline} 'Muslim
terrorists' or '[Russian hybrid warfare']{.underline}, as [discourses of
fear are al- ways contingent]{.underline}. Societies are complicit in
the production of their fears through the reflexive/strategic as well as
non-reflexive/habitual ways through which discourses are produced and
reproduced. This also makes it possible to chal- lenge them and search
for alternatives. J[particular objects of fear, including geopolitical
ones, are eventually failing, as these objects are **ultimately 'false
targets'**]{.underline}. They are [merely temporary discursive vessels
functioning as placeholders for expressing deeper ontological anxiety,
**which is bound to strike back**]{.underline}. Consequently,
[**attempts to make societies** (feel) **more secure**, habitually end
up **mak**ing **them** (feel) equally, or even **more,
insecure**]{.underline} [and anxious, **regardless of how much effort is
invested** into fighting this or that particular threat]{.underline}. As
Heath-Kelly (2015, 2018) and Jacobsen (2020) have shown, [**successful
security** discourses like counter-terrorism or cybersecurity **have
actually managed to internalise this 'failure** to secure']{.underline}
(Heath-Kelly, 2015) **[by incorporating it into their very
structure.]{.underline}** According to them, counter-terrorism and
cybersecurity are [constructed as dangers so slip- pery and multifaceted
that once we resolve one problem]{.underline} ([by killing Osama bin
Laden]{.underline}, resolving [a particular cyberthreat]{.underline}),
[**a whole new range** of terrorist groups or cyber issues **emerges**
to occupy their place.]{.underline} Consequently, and in contrast to
conventional ontological security literature, [politics of anxiety is
not only about managing and repressing it through
narrative]{.underline}s, routines and relationships. [It is also about
other ways of **manipulating anxiety for political purposes**,
**including repro- ducing,** nurturing and spreading it via the
construction of **threats** so **opaque and widespread** that they
cannot be possibly resolved, like terrorism, cybersecurity -- or hybrid
warfare]{.underline}. By its repeated failure to secure, such discourses
hold societies in the anxious 'state of constant and heightened
alertness' (Davies, 2019, p. xii), [making them **ready to accept** a
range of pre-emptive security measures across all possible areas of
social life.]{.underline} Bringing the argument together, by the notion
of anxiety geopolitics we conceptualise the politics of dealing with
anxiety by linking it to objects and issues spatialised through the
means of geopolitical imagi- nations. By references to geographical
categories, such as states, regions, continents or civilisations, this
type of affective geopolitics promises to transform the amorphous and
ambiguous anxiety stemming from range of different issues into tangible
and manageable objects of fear taking the form of geopolitical threats.
Yet, as all [such narratives and images are ultimately bound to fail to
resolve the underlying anxiety]{.underline}, the analytical focus must
be extended also to how these failures are accounted for and how anxiety
is being further reproduced with the help of geopolitical imaginations.
Therefore, anxiety geopolitics is ultimately about the oscillation
between repressing anxiety through the geo- politicisation of both the
'threat' and the self, as much as it is about dealing with the recurring
failures to secure the subjects produced by such geopoliticisation,
which result in reproduction of social anxiety. 3. Hybrid warfare as
anxiety geopolitics: learning from the Czech case We will now further
develop our conceptual argument by discussing hybrid warfare as a case
of anxiety geopolitics. Some have already shown that [HW]{.underline}
[**plays an ontological security role at the level of NATO** and
EU]{.underline}, as it '[links the uncertainty emanating from the hybrid
nature of the new threats to the known]{.underline} and routine
relationship with its tradi- tional antagonist', that is Russia (M
̈alksoo, 2018, p. 380). Following this argument, **[Russia's aggression
suddenly gave meaning to a range of hitherto unconnected, yet
omnipresent, and, therefore, anxiety-inducing problems that
NATO]{.underline}**, EU and their member states **[were
facing]{.underline}**. Polar- isation and the rise of
**[populism]{.underline}**, widespread **[distrust]{.underline}** in
institutions, erosion of [**international norms**,]{.underline}
**[cyberattacks]{.underline}**, **[propaganda]{.underline}** and
**[disinfor- mation]{.underline}** campaigns **[suddenly all 'made
sense',]{.underline}** if they [could be discur- sively linked to Moscow
as]{.underline} instances of '**[Russian hybrid warfare']{.underline}**.
HW thus provided NATO and EU, with [the elusive 'security' of knowing
one's enemy]{.underline} (also Browning, 2018). Similarly, in Czechia,
the [HW discourse arrived at a time of intense social anxieties emerging
from a range of different cultural, economic or geopolitical
factors.]{.underline} For many in Czechia (and Central Europe more
broadly), [post-Cold War sense of ontological security had been provided
through a civilisational geopolitical imagination of 'the
West',]{.underline} which Central Europe supposedly (re)joined after
1989 (Cadier, 2019; Kuus, 2007; Todorova, 2009). Best captured by the
slogan of a 'return to Europe', the vision of embracing liberal
democracy, capitalism and Euro-Atlantic political structures was seen as
a panacea that would resolve all big (geo)political questions once and
for all. However, these very principles and structures arguably started
crumbling precisely at the time that the Central Europeans were finally
0admitted in EU and NATO. The [Iraq]{.underline} War [laid bare the
rifts within the West]{.underline}, calling in question its further
relevance as a coherent geopolitical entity (Brown- ing & Lehti, 2010;
Jackson, 2006). [Resurgent Russia challenged Western
hegemony]{.underline} in Europe and led 'an influential part of the
Czech political and intellectual elite \[to\] succumb\[\...\] to
anxiety' (Drul ́ak, 2012, p. 79). Central European countries were hit
particularly hard by the economic crisis and further hurt themselves by
the (foreign- or self-imposed) 'Western' medicine of austerity (Tooze,
2018, pp. 220--238). In the Czech case, this led to one of the longest
periods of economic recovery in Europe, accompanied by a free-fall in
public trust in institutions, with only one in ten Czechs expressing
trust in the government (11%) and the Chamber of Deputies (10%) at the
lowest point in 2012/2013 (CVVM, 2013). Add to this the rise of
illiberalism at home and increasing divides between the 'old' and 'new'
EU member states, laid bare especially during the so called 'refugee
crisis' of 2015--2016. As a consequence, you end up with a region that
is not so sure about its feeling about and to- wards 'the West' any
longer (Kazharski, 2018; Krastev & Holmes, 2019). Put differently, by
mid-2010s, the Czech society was already in a state of anxiety and
uncertainty about its own geopolitical identity and in search for
ontological fixes.3 [**This is where the HW discourse clicks** in
following Russia's aggression against Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014. To
the liberal voices that dominate security debates, [hybrid warfare could
be used to put a name on this anxiety]{.underline} and thereby attempt
to **[suppress it by the construction of familiar geopolitical
narratives]{.underline}**. By invoking the prism of a [conflict
between]{.underline} a liberal-democratic [West]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} an authoritarian [Russia]{.underline}, [all sorts of
problems -- spread of misinformation, return of nationalism,
technological transformations or global power shifts]{.underline} --
**[could be reduced to the logic of civilisational
confrontation]{.underline}**. This is the conventional ontological
security part of the story, to which we add another step by showing how
[this promise of security is never actually fulfilled]{.underline}. Du[e
to the supposed invisibility and omnipresence]{.underline} of hybrid
threats [and the insecure position]{.underline} the Czechs occupy in
their own East/ West geopolitical imagination, **[there is a surplus of
anxiety that cannot be successfully managed.]{.underline}** The case
study is structured according to the two 'faces' of the Janus- faced
politics of anxiety. First, we show how hybrid warfare was used as a
sense-making device promising to manage anxiety by providing a
conceptual link between a broad range of social issues and anchoring
them within the familiar East/West geopolitical imagination. [This
linking]{.underline} could [simultaneously make hybrid warfare
meaningful]{.underline} by [geo- politicising it]{.underline}, and
[reinforce the]{.underline} crumbling [East/West geopolitical
imagination]{.underline} by showing its renewed relevance in facing
hybrid warfare. Second, we show how the fleeting sense of ontological
security achieved via this articulation gets undone by the recurring
re-emergence of sur- plus anxiety and how HW ends up reproducing and
perpetuating the sense of insecurity and anxiety it was supposed to
resolve. The analysis is grounded in a range of empirical materials from
2014 to 2020, including official documents, media articles, popular
books and parliamentary debates. Two caveats are in order. First, both
Czech [government]{.underline} and civil society have [responded to the
perceived threat of HW]{.underline} in many ways, including creating new
official institutions and informal initiatives tailored to deal with it
(Daniel & Eberle, 2018). In this article, we focus on the discourse that
made these responses possible. Second, as shown elsewhere (Daniel &
Eberle, 2021), the Czech HW discourse is not monolithic and includes
different understandings of what exactly con- stitutes a threat to whom,
ranging from military operations targeting public infrastructures all
the way to individual citizen's struggles with media literacy. In this
article, though, we downplay these differences and instead focus on the
commonalities that tie these different notions together as parts of
ostensibly the same problem of Russia's 'hybrid warfare'. 3.1.
Repressing anxiety: making sense of hybrid warfare through East/ West
geopolitics Starting with the repression side of anxiety geopolitics,
this can be observed inthe successive steps through which ontological
security is sought by associating a range of issues with hybrid warfare
and then pinning HW onto the familiar map of East/West geopolitical
imagina- tion. This consists of four interrelated discursive moves:
identifying the supposed 'origin' of societal unease, putting a name of
the problem, localising it in space, and endowing it with broader
geopolitical mean- ings. In this particular case, [Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014 [serves as the supposed original moment and
'cause' of anxiety]{.underline}, hybrid warfare is the name presented to
make sense of what is going on, [Russia is constructed as the
threat]{.underline}, and civilisational East/West geopolitics is used to
give the situation broader meaning. Let us now discuss each of these
steps in turn. First, [a certain event needs to be constructed as a
supposed point of origin of the perceived unease, **a
'crisis'**]{.underline} that dislocates the symbolic order (Nabers,
2015). This is the first move in the repression of anxiety, one in which
an 'actually existing' empirical event is discursively pre- sented as
the apparent cause of the deeper ontological crisis that is affectively
experienced as anxiety. In the HW discourse in Czechia, Russia's
aggression against Ukraine of 2014 is presented as such pro- foundly
shocking and dislocating event. As the otherwise rather down-to-earth
and matter-of-fact military intellectual, Karel ˇRehka, puts it: 'the
Russian Federation shocked the whole world. The unimaginable was broken
into.' (ˇRehka, 2017, p. 199) 'Shock' and 'helplessness' are words used
also by a high-ranking Czech diplomat (personal interview, Prague,
August 4, 2020). A leading Czech think-tanker then recalls how
'surprised' he was by Russia's invasion and how 'disorganised and
fragmented' the security debates were in the months that followed
(Janda, 2017). The affective experience is captured well also in a
widely cited and circulated popular book, which vividly describes how
'we are walking on the edge of a cliff' and '\[u\]ncertainty is the only
thing that you can count on these days' (Alvarov ́a, 2017, p. 20).
Therefore, 2014 was constructed as a radical breakthrough into a much
more insecure world. Yet, this move of identifying the supposed origin
of these dizzying feelings of anxiety in one particular event was at the
same time already the first step of seeking ontological security by
making sense of it. [A second step is putting the name on the
problem]{.underline}. It is only the performative and affect-laden
performance of naming that connects disparate phenomena together and
creates a discursive 'object' that can be then dealt with politically
(Laclau, 2005). [In our case, this leads to the creative appropriation
of the concepts of 'hybrid warfare']{.underline} and 'hybrid threats',
which were virtually non-existent in the Czech public discourse prior to
2014 (Daniel & Eberle, 2018), [and using them as a linchpin that
connects all sorts of societal problems.]{.underline} For an
authoritative Czech se- curity document, 'hybrid threat' is a 'way to
wage a confrontation or a conflict', one that is characterised by an
extraordinarily broad spectrum of measures: 'a wide, complex, adaptable,
and integrated combination of conventional and unconventional means,
overt and covert activities, characterised primarily by coercion and
subversion' (Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p.
127). [**The range of actors** that can execute such methods is
**similarly broad**]{.underline}, including 'military, para- military,
and various civilian actors' (ibid.). Similarly, an overview of a
'Russian hybrid strategy' provided by the counterintelligence service
includes 'interpretation of modern history', different ways of 'informa-
tion warfare', 'networking/infiltration' [across the fields of politics,
economy, crime, espionage, culture and education, and militar-
y/guerrilla operations alike]{.underline} (Security Information Service,
2018, p. 7). In statements like these, [hybrid warfare is stretched so
as to incorporate almost anything that can be understood as a hostile
activity.]{.underline} A such, it [becomes an universal object of
fea]{.underline}r, [broad enough to be used as a placeholder for all
sorts of anxieties]{.underline}. In the third move, hybrid
[warfare]{.underline} is [territorialised by pointing to Russia as its
ultimate source]{.underline}. The 'postmodern' geopolitical imagination
of hybrid warfare in terms of flows, clouds and infrastructures, is
backgrounded in favour of the 'modern' territorial East/West geopolitics
of a Russian threat. In certain cases, this [means little more than
merely pointing out that it is indeed Russia that 'has executed hybrid
operations]{.underline} \[ \...\], including targeted disinformation
activities and cyber-attacks', as the Defence Strategy (Ministry of
Defence of the Czech Republic, 2017, p. 7) puts it explicitly and other
documents hint at implicitly (e.g. Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the
Czech Republic, 2015). More inter- esting are the instances which
present Russia not only as one source of threats, but as an orchestrator
coordinating all possible means and ac- tors. In such cases, the
'postmodern' geopolitical imagination of net- works is used and
reproduced, yet with a key twist: such networks are seen as
hierarchical, with centre in Moscow. In this logic, different do- mestic
actors -- 'alternative news' websites spreading anti-Western nar-
ratives, right-wing populists, even contrarian intellectuals -- can
ultimately be tied to an overall Russia's masterplan (for an example see
Janda & Kundra, 2016). The counterintelligence agency reports are an
example of this ['puppet-master' approach]{.underline}. One of them
[lists 'covert infiltration]{.underline} of Czech media and the
Internet' and 'foundation of puppet organizations, covert and
[open]{.underline} [support of populist or extremist
subjects']{.underline} among the key activities of Russia's 'information
operations' (Security Information Service, 2016, p. 9). [Another
outlines this logic]{.underline} in colourful detail,
[claiming]{.underline} that '[Russia is creating a structure in Europe
drawing on the concept of]{.underline} the Comintern (the
[Communist]{.underline} International; the Third International) founded
by the Soviet Union' (Security Information Ser- vice, 2015, p. 11), [an
organised network of all sorts of actors]{.underline} 'with pro-Russian
stances or fighting against the system' (ibid., 12). However, [different
actors can be labelled as agents or instrument of HW and then
geopoliticised and linked to Russia]{.underline} not only by direct as-
sociation, but also because they are [merely voicing opinions that can
be somehow qualified as 'pro-Russian']{.underline}. As a more recent
counterintelli- gence report puts it, actually an 'overwhelming majority
of disinfor- mation websites in Czech are the work of Czech \[\...\]
citizens, who are not supported by Russian entities.' (Security
Information Service, 2018, p. 8) Nevertheless, this still makes them a
part of a broader geopolitical threat, as 'these people and their
internet projects are misused by Russia to spread propaganda or support
other components of the hybrid strat- egy.' (ibid., 8) [It is this
imagination of a Russian-orchestrated networked threat that enables a
leading]{.underline} Czech [journalist]{.underline} [to blankly
dismiss]{.underline} the prominent [disinformation]{.underline} website,
Aeronet. cz, [as 'writing for Putin']{.underline} (Kundra, 2016b),
[without]{.underline} [any evidence of links]{.underline} to the Russian
state known at that point and with his own subsequent investigations
showing that this is most likely not the case. It also makes it possible
to [deal with anxieties by externalising the problem]{.underline}, such
as when a popular book argues that 'Furious hate \[\...\] is not Czech,
it is something new, foreign. It came from the outside and 'somehow'
entered into us.' (Alvarov ́a, 2017, p. 88). In the fourth and final
move, this 'hybrid' struggle with Russia is endowed with meaning by
being inserted into the whole symbolic structure of East/West
civilisational geopolitics, in which '\[i\]ssues of security and
geopolitics are \[\...\] reframed in cultural terms. [They become
simultaneously geographical, cultural and strategic concepts, and they
diffuse into ever more spheres of political life]{.underline}.' (Kuus,
2007, p. x) The societal anxieties that are managed via the narrative of
hybrid warfare emanating from Russia, are now also made part of an

6struggle between the East and the West. This [reactivates the 'mental
maps']{.underline}, in which 'the West' functions as a desired point of
identification and a promise of security and prosperity, whereas 'the
East' is seen as 'an abyss', a notion 'which in the Czech political
discourse refers less to a geographical space than to ontological
categories defining the alienated past of the Czech Republic.' (Cadier,
2019, p. 84) As one member of parliament, Jan Bartoˇsek, put it, the
Czechs are left with an unequivocal choice: '[either we will be part of
NATO as a firm ally of our pro-Western orientation, or we will be just
one of Russia's many colonies. There is no third way]{.underline}.' (in
Chamber of Deputies, 2018a). In statements like these, [Russia is
presented as a fundamentally different entity, a quintessentially
Oriental actor]{.underline}, [belonging to a different 'universe' that
'until nowadays has not met' with the European one]{.underline} (Alvarov
́a, 2017, p. 70). Echoing classical Orientalist tropes, Rus- sians
supposedly rely on '\[m\]ysticism, irrationality, associational instead
of logical thinking -- thus, a model of thinking that is of different
civilisation, the one we know rather from the Orient' (Alvarov ́a, 2017,
p. 193). [The potentially catastrophic consequences of allying with
Russia]{.underline} are then often [presented through references to the
past]{.underline}, reinforcing the notion that what is at stake in HW is
in fact yet another instance of a historical struggle between
civilisations. 'Many of us probably know our modern history, from 1945
through 1948, Russian advisers, death of \[foreign minister\] Jan
Masaryk, occupation in 1968. The Russian in- fluence, which simply broke
us away from the West, ripped us from \[our\] democratic development,
and has incalculable economic conse- quences stretching to this day.'
(Helena Langˇs ́adlov ́a in Chamber of Deputies, 2018b). [This idea that
issues like propaganda]{.underline}, misinformation [or rise of
populism]{.underline} [are instances of a dramatic geopolitical
confrontation, is]{.underline} finally [driven home]{.underline} also
[by the]{.underline} [notion that it is the West as a whole that is
under attack]{.underline}, [not just any individual
country]{.underline}. According to a coun- terintelligence report, '[the
goal of the Russian hybrid campaign]{.underline}' is 'primarily
[to]{.underline} [weaken NATO]{.underline} and the EU internally, e.g.
by weakening individual member states' (Security Information Service,
2018, p. 7). Therefore, should the Czechs fail to defend themselves,
they are sup- posedly endangering something much bigger. According to a
member of parliament, Jan Lipavský, what the Russians want is 'to break
European unity' (Chamber of Deputies, 2018b). Such ideas connect hybrid
warfare squarely to the Messianistic undertones of the East/West
geopolitical imagination, in which the Central Europeans serve as
guardians defending the West at its limit. To paraphrase Milan Kundera's
(1984) foundational essay on Central European civilisational
geopolitics, by fighting hybrid warfare, the Czechs are risking 'dying
for Czechia and the West', which indeed gives a sense of deep purpose
and meaning to their cause and produces a strong anxiety-repressing
narrative. To sum up this part, one important aspect of the anxiety
geopolitics of hybrid warfare lies in the way how it allows channelling
deeper anxieties by using the East/West geopolitical imagination to
produce familiar storylines, identities and objects of fear. [Despite
being con- structed as multifaceted, broad and difficult to detect,
hybrid warfare is made legible by being]{.underline} projected on a
[familiar]{.underline} 'mental map', [where it becomes merely the most
recent instance of long-lasting struggle be- tween the West and a
fundamentally different, antagonist Russia.]{.underline} However, the
relationship between the discourses of hybrid warfare and East/West
geopolitics goes both ways: HW is not only territorialised by, but also
gives broader meaning to and, in a way, promises to reinforce the
East/West civilisational geopolitics. It is in and through HW that
Russia is constructed as fundamentally different and the West presented
as a coherent entity under attack, as well as something worth defending
against the potentially tragic alternatives. [Through the discourse of
hybrid warfare, doubts about the relevance]{.underline} or [resilience
of a West- centric geopolitical order are]{.underline} seemingly
[brushed away and old geopo- litical identities are
hardened]{.underline}. This is precisely the logic of ontological
security that [makes the]{.underline} ideas of a 'return of geopolitics'
and the '[new Cold War']{.underline} so [appealing]{.underline}, as
shown by Guzzini (2012, 2016) and Browning (2018). 3.2. Reproducing
anxiety: danger is everywhere and the East is already within The [HW
discourse arguably succeeds on the level of]{.underline} meaning, that
is in '[making sense']{.underline} [of]{.underline} the [new threats by
geopoliticising them in East/ West terms.]{.underline} In contrast, its
success is only fleeting at best as an anxiety- repressing ontological
fix. In this section, we focus on the other face of anxiety geopolitics,
showing how the HW discourse also contributes to the reproduction of
anxiety. The argument that security discourses end up perpetuating the
very insecurity they promise to deal with is not new (e. g. Campbell,
1998). More recently, Heath-Kelly (2018) and Jacobsen (2020) have
advanced it from an explicitly Lacanian perspective and shown how the
discourses of terrorism and cybersecurity are inherently bound to
disappoint the underlying desire for security. [The endurance of these
discourses is made possible by]{.underline} [way how they pre-emptively
incorporate an explanation for their own failure]{.underline}.
**[Terrorism and cyber- threats are constructed in such a broad, complex
and omnipresent manner that no individual achievement can lead to the
resolution of the problems presented by these discourses.]{.underline}**
**[There are always new risks]{.underline}** and vulnerabilities, [as
the destruction or neutralisation of no actually existing objects of
fear]{.underline} (e.g. Osama bin Laden) [can ultimately satisfy the
underlying ontological anxieties.]{.underline} There is always something
else to worry about. Building on Heath-Kelly and Jacobsen, our final
argument is that hybrid warfare works exactly like their examples, as
HW, too, is a discourse that is simultaneously anxiety-repressing and
anxiety- reproducing. In fact, we argue that the linking of HW and
East/West geopolitics produces a particularly strongly anxiety-ridden
discourse. [While hybrid warfare presents threats as invisible and
omnipresent]{.underline} due to their covert and networked nature, [the
East/West imagination]{.underline} further [raises the
stakes]{.underline} and salience [of such threats by painting them as
parts of a]{.underline} titanic [civilisational struggle]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} [subjects]{.underline} [produced]{.underline} by such
discourse [can never rest]{.underline}, as what may be going on right
behind their noses is not just one particular cyber-attack, a single
conspiracy theory that has gained traction on Facebook, or merely one
instance of information stolen by a spy. Instead, [it is a battle for
the future of 'the West']{.underline} and the Czech belonging to it, one
where [the alternative]{.underline} option is the most tragic one: [a
descent deep into the 'abyss']{.underline} of 'the East' (Cadier, 2019).
We will now illustrate these arguments by [focusing on the
unfathomability of HW]{.underline}, [the shifting]{.underline} nature of
the threats it produces, and the [anxieties inherent in the East/West
geopolitics]{.underline} that underpin it. First, [the]{.underline}
'[failure to secure']{.underline} (Heath-Kelly, 2015[) is pre-emptively
incorporated in the HW discourse by its portrayal of the looming dan-
gers as insidious, invisible and even impossible to detect.]{.underline}
As a key se- curity document states, '\[[t\]he principal risk to which a
subject attacked by a hybrid campaign is exposed lies in the fact that
they will not be able to identify the hybrid campaign]{.underline} -- in
time, in its full scale, or [at all']{.underline} (Ministry of the
Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 129). According to the deputy
Helena Langˇs ́adlov ́a, [what we are supposedly facing are highly
dangerous]{.underline}, yet 'creeping [threats']{.underline}, [which we
'cannot see]{.underline} on a day by day basis' (in Chamber of Deputies,
2019). This leads some to claim that 'at no point in history was it so
extremely difficult to decide, if we are at war, or not' (T ́aborský,
2019, p. 164). While there may be little drama on the surface, **[no one
can ever rest in this logic.]{.underline}** An attack may be already
underway, [one that can even be approximated to war, **literally at any
minute**]{.underline}. As the Special Forces general, Karel ˇRehka, put
it at a conference organised in the Czech parliament: 'In a way, we are
already at war, we just do not realise it or are not able to admit it.'
(Lang, 2015) [This is a mode of thinking that produces highly anxious
subjects, in a constant]{.underline} sense of the '**[expectant
dread']{.underline}** that is anxiety (Hook, 2015, p. 117), [one not yet
having a clear referent]{.underline} **[and directed towards all
possible]{.underline}** yet still **[unknown dangers that may
materialise at any time]{.underline}**. It is in these notions that an
unspecified existential threat may be hidden behind mundane events that
the otherwise backgrounded 'postmodern' geopolitical imagination of HW
suddenly kicks back in. If the 'modern' East/West **[geopolitical
imagination 'made sense']{.underline}** and J. Eberle and J. Daniel
Political Geography 92 (2022) 102502 [7provided at least some fleeting
ontological security]{.underline} by pointing to Russia, this is
frustrated by the surplus anxiety produced via this 'post- modern'
imagination of insidious, **[hidden networks operating in phys- ical and
cyberspace alike]{.underline}**. In fact, as the discourse postulates,
[we may not even know that it really is Russia in the first place that
is behind a particular incident]{.underline}, as [hybrid
attackers]{.underline} seek to [create]{.underline} '[an environment
where responsibility for these activities cannot]{.underline} (at least
formally) [be attributed to them]{.underline}, or at least only
speculatively and with great diffi- culty' (Ministry of the Interior of
the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 127). We may ultimately never know if this
or that mundane event is actually not a part of something much bigger,
as it is the very aim of the attacker to 'prevent a clear interpretation
of events and the discovery of their interconnectedness' (Ministry of
the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 127). Therefore, while the
prevalent 'modern' geopolitical reading of HW enables channelling
anxiety by constructing Russia an object of fear, it still remains far
from the manageable fear of 'fight or flight' (Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020,
p. 241). This is because these sup- posedly known aspects of the danger
are constantly being accompanied and disrupted by the surplus anxiety of
the 'unknown unknowns' stemming from the partial inclusion of the
'postmodern' geopolitical reading. **[This effectively pre-empts the HW
discourse from ever solving the problems it is supposedly designed to
tackle]{.underline}**, as it is wholly **[unclear how to act upon
threats]{.underline}** [that we are not yet aware of]{.underline} or do
not know how to make sense of. Second, this oscillation between the
known and the unknown and between fear and anxiety manifests itself in
the constantly shifting construction of what is supposed to be the exact
nature of the threat coming from Russia. This is best illustrated in the
wording of the annual reports of the Czech counterintelligence agency
(SIS), which reinforce the notion that Russia is indeed a severe threat,
yet the precise character and shape of this threat appears to be
changing year after year. As already mentioned, in first annual public
report reflecting on the situ- ation after Russia's aggression against
Ukraine, the SIS warned that their assessment showed the formation of
what was spectacularly labelled as the 'New Reincarnation of the
Comintern' -- a loose network of allied actors, similar to the Cold War
Soviet-controlled network of ideologi- cally affiliated political
parties, agitators and agents. The danger was portrayed as a new version
of this tried and tested strategy, which Russia supposedly employs to
connect different groups dissatisfied with the Western liberal democracy
(Security Information Service, 2015, pp. 11--12). However, the spectre
of the Comintern was a one-off, never to appear again. Instead, SIS
later concluded that the threat resided in a much looser combination of
often uncoordinated actions of Russian intelli- gence, authentic Czech
individuals not in any way linked to Moscow but 'only' spreading their
own 'pro-Russian' worldviews, and finally, even in the lack of education
about modern history in schools (Security Infor- mation Service, 2018,
pp. 6--8). This trend of diffusing the danger from a Kremlin-coordinated
network to seeing the threats in mere ideological resonances further
continued. The most recent report notes that there is a 'transition from
state-controlled or directed activities to spontaneous actions' of
like-minded actors. 'When Russian state officials express what they
desire to happen (for instance by spreading manipulative information),
proxy actors without any links to the Russian state pro- ceed to action
on their own initiative and based on what they think the officials might
want' (Security Information Service, 2020, p. 9). Through this move, the
spectre of 'Russian hybrid warfare' can now encompass virtually anything
that can be somehow interpreted as matching with the desires or
interests of the Kremlin, without any need for proving direct links, as
these are no longer considered necessary. **[The construction of 'a
threat' now includes even situations when 'a foreign power does not
engage in any direct action and keeps its distance]{.underline}**, while
using various ways (PR, instigating statements, propaganda etc.) to
inspire individual persons to take action' (Security Information
Service, 2020, p. 9). Put differently, [Russian threat can be present
even where there is no direct Russian hand whatsoever]{.underline}.
**[Literally any individual with views]{.underline}**
[somehow]{.underline} [similar to those of the Russian state can be seen
as part of it,]{.underline} which makes the idea that **[security can
ever be achieved virtually impossible]{.underline}**. Instead, this
logic contributes to the [reproduction of an anxious
society]{.underline}, defined by '[the constant presence of the
possibility of that threat, and with it, the sense that government
cannot fully protect the people and that danger resides in the
everyday]{.underline}' (Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020, p. 247). Third, this
notion that the possibility that something 'Russian' may be insidiously
present deep within the Czech society then revives also the old
anxieties inherent in the 'modern' East/West geopolitical imagination
it- self. Central Europeans' self-positioning in East/West geopolitics
is highly ambivalent (Kuus, 2007; Todorova, 2009). On the one hand,
being or becoming part of 'the Western civilisation' is a source of
ontological se- curity. On the other hand, [this security is never quite
complete or perma- nent]{.underline}. This is because Central Europeans
locate themselves at the very limit of the West, as 'European edge-men'
(M ̈alksoo, 2010, p. 5), whose mem- bership in the civilisation must
constantly be proved as it can always be taken away -- especially by the
forces of the 'East'. The 'old shadow of Yalta', the feeling that the
region's 'freedom could yet again be expendable in times of crisis' is
constantly present (M ̈alksoo, 2010, p. 75). Put differ- ently,
East/West geopolitics equips the Czech 'pro-Western' security in-
tellectuals with a 'mental map, where the country is depicted as being
on the "edge" of Europe and constantly risking to "fall" into an abyss
\[\...\] traditionally characterised as the "East"' (Cadier, 2019, p.
84). While the East/West geopolitical imagination can succeed in
spatialising the threat in the Russian 'other', [the position it grants
to the self is always potentially insecure. Therefore, it is also
East/West geopolitics itself that produces subjects that are constantly
on alert]{.underline}, facing the constant 'possibility of loss of one's
soul' (Balaska, 2019, p. 8) that defines the experience of anxiety. Such
fragile geopolitical self-positioning further fuels the search for new
and new sources of hybrid threats, as failing to uncover and face them
may have existential consequences, especially given that 'Easternness'
may have already infiltrated and compromised the Czech social body. This
notion of 'East within' links to the above discussed unfathomability and
invisibility of HW and manifests itself in multiple ways. For one
counterintelligence report, it takes the form of smuggled ideas and
narratives, presented 'in a way leading Czech citizens to believe they
are recipients of opinions held by fellow citizens not of Russian
propaganda' (Security Information Service, 2015, p. 11). Similarly, a
popular book on 'fake news' geopoliticises social attitudes en bloc by
identifying them along East/West axis, presenting the 'disappointed'
part of society as 'seeing a model in Russia, or perhaps China' (Gregor,
Mlejnkov ́a, & Zvolsi.info, 2018, p. 62). For others, the 'East within'
takes the form in the physical presence of 'Putin's agents' who
supposedly '**[quite likely teach your children at universities, you
meet them for a coffee in your favourite caf ́e or work in normal
jobs.]{.underline}**' (Kundra, 2016a, p. 88). The anxiety geopolitics of
hybrid warfare is thus also about creating the normatively highly
disturbing '"red under every bed" mentality' (Fridman, 2018, p. 3) and
applying 'the ethics of total war \[\...\] even to the smallest
skirmish' (Galeotti, 2019, p. 8). Therefore, viewing security threats
through the prism of hybrid warfare reproduces a highly anxious society
and perpetuates the justification for those 'intellectuals of
statecraft' ( ́O Tuathail & Agnew, 1992) that would not hesitate to pro-
vide the sort of geopolitical fixes that were discussed in the previous
sections. Thereby, the discourse ends up reproducing itself, as the two
faces of anxiety geopolitics not only disrupt, but also dialectically
reinforce one another: geopolitical discourse emerges to repress anxiety
and provide ontological security, yet the anxiety inherent in the
discourse disrupts ontological security and, to come full circle,
creates the need for geopolitical discourses. The result is a society
oscillating between its desire to avoid anxiety and the repeated
frustration thereof; an affective pulsation that has arguably been
elevated to a dominant mode of politics of (in)security in our present
time (Eklundh et al., 2017), of which hybrid warfare is a prime example.
As similar patterns of anxious over-reaction and securitisation of broad
areas of social life have been recognised by authors writing about HW in
different J. Eberle and J. Daniel Political Geography 92 (2022) 102502
8empirical contexts (Fridman, 2018; Galeotti, 2019; M ̈alksoo, 2018;

̈Ord ́en, 2019), we believe that the problem with 'hybrid warfare' is of
a more general nature and the relevance of our analysis reaches beyond
the Czech case. 4. Conclusion Introducing anxiety geopolitics as a
conceptual linchpin between disparate arguments from debates on critical
geopolitics, ontological security, and politics of anxiety, this article
made two central contri- butions. First, we have theorised the
relationship between geopolitics and anxiety, moving beyond the existing
accounts above all by pointing out the Janus-faced character of anxiety
geopolitics, in which anxiety is both repressed and reproduced. Second,
using the case of Czechia, we have argued that hybrid warfare is a
discourse that constantly oscillates between repressing anxiety by
geopoliticising the source of danger in East/West terms, and subverting
its own constructions by presenting the threats as insidious, invisible,
and constantly shifting. Therefore, we contend that the HW discourse is
structured in a way that cannot achieve its purported ambition to secure
populations against 'hybrid threats' and instead ends up producing more
insecurity and anxiety. Our argument has clear normative implications
that expand the existing criticisms of HW by putting the underlying
civilisational geopolitics in spotlight. This should help us challenge
the technology- centred presentism of the HW discourse, showing that
many of the ostensibly unprecedented concerns are in fact reheated
versions of narratives that date back decades if not centuries. More
importantly, it enables us to point to the presence of some of the
highly problematic aspects of East/West thinking, especially those that
have been rightly criticised as Orientalist, chauvinist or even racist
(see e.g. Said, 1978; Todorova, 2009). Realising the presence of
civilisational geopolitics makes it possible to ask whether certain
portrayals of Russia in HW debates -- e.g. as barbaric, irrational,
irredeemable -- may not represent narcissistic projections of the
'Western' self, rather than credible threat assessments (Chernobrov,
2019). [Importantly, these are not scholastic matters of concern just
for ivory-tower peaceniks,]{.underline} as the proponents of HW
sometimes like to put it. Instead, **[these criticisms have clear impli-
cations for security policy.]{.underline}** As recognised even among
[NATO's own an- alysts and officials]{.underline} (Caliskan & Li
́egeois, 2020; Rühle, 2019), **[adopting the prism of HW and labelling
Russia as an inherently irrational enemy is detrimental to leading a
productive debate]{.underline}** on the exact nature of the challenges
that Putin's regime poses and formulating appropriate and efficient
strategies to respond to it. We add to it by highlighting that the [HW
discourse]{.underline} not only 'undermi[nes strategic
thinking]{.underline}' (Caliskan & Li ́egeois, 2020), but also **[never
actually manages to provide security]{.underline}** and [creates highly
concerning societal side-effects]{.underline} (perpetuation of anxiety,
proliferation of Orientalist images). There are also important
qualifications of our argument and avenues for further research. First
of all, we certainly do not claim that everyone who ever spoke of
'hybrid threats' or 'hybrid warfare' would find themselves in agreement
with the examples used in our analysis, or be instantly guilty of
Orientalism. While the article focused on overarching themes, there is
certainly variation within the HW discourse, not only in Czechia (Daniel
& Eberle, 2021), but also in Germany, UK or EU (Jan- iˇcatov ́a &
Mlejnkov ́a, 2021; Monsees, 2020; ̈Ord ́en, 2019). One intriguing
possibility for further research is in showing the variation in the way
how geopolitical thought is invoked and anxiety repressed and reproduced
within the different versions of the HW discourse. More generally, the
theoretical argument should also be tried and developed in other
contexts.

The Dangers of an AI Race for Technological Advantage: In Rhetoric and
in Reality

[What is so bad about framing the development of AI in terms of a race
for technological advantage?]{.underline} After all, it is widely agreed
that AI brings enormous potential benefits across many sectors. One
recent report estimated that it could add £232 billion by 2030 to the UK
economy alone, with healthcare one of the sectors most enhanced,
potentially bringing faster, better service to consumers (PwC 2017).
There is a widespread belief that competition and other market forces
are central to such innovation. So in as much as a race to develop AI
technology means these kinds of benefit come sooner, we have reason to
view it positively.

But at the same time, [the development of such a potentially powerful
new technology will need to be steered]{.underline} if it is to be as
beneficial as possible [while minimising]{.underline} the
[risks]{.underline} it might pose (Crawford and Calo 2016). In the words
of the Future of Life Institute's open letter on 'Research Priorities
for Robust and Beneficial Artificial Intelligence', signed by over 8,000
people including many leading figures in AI, work should focus "not only
on making AI more capable, but also on maximizing the societal benefit
of AI." (Future of Life Institute, 2017a). [The danger of an AI race is
that it makes]{.underline} exactly this thoughtful [steering towards
broadly beneficial outcomes more difficult]{.underline}.

Three Sets of Risks

We want to distinguish between three sets of risks:\
i) The dangers of an AI 'race for technological advantage' framing,
regardless of whether the race is seriously pursued;\
ii) The dangers of an AI 'race for technological advantage' framing and
an actual AI race for technological advantage, regardless of whether the
race is won;\
iii) The dangers of an AI race for technological advantage being won.

\(i\) Risks Posed by a Race Rhetoric Alone

It is possible that [**the trend towards 'race for technological
advantage' terminology** in AI]{.underline}, [including suggestions such
as Vladimir Putin's that the winner of such a race "will become the
ruler of the world," **could pose risks even if the race is not pursued
in earnest, let alone won**.]{.underline} We perceive two main risks
here:\
(i.a) The kind of [thoughtful consideration of how to achieve broadly
beneficial AI]{.underline}, as mentioned above, [will require subtle,
inclusive, multi-stakeholder deliberation over a prolonged
period]{.underline}. [The rhetoric of the race for technological
advantage]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} its [implicit or explicit
threat]{.underline} that dire consequences will follow if some other
group wins that race, [is not likely to be conducive to such
deliberation]{.underline}. Indeed, [rhetoric around technological
superiority (such as the **'arms race' rhetoric**]{.underline} used in
the Cold War in the US), [played into what has been called a **politics
of fear, or a politics of insecurity**]{.underline} \-- that is, a
political climate that discourages debate in favour of unquestioning
support for a prescribed agenda (Griffith 1987). In The Politics of
Insecurity, Jef Huysmans argues that [use of the **language of
security**]{.underline} (by which he means militarised language, [which
would include 'arms race' and related rhetoric]{.underline}) "[**is a
particular technique of framing policy questions in logics of survival
with a capacity to mobilize politics of fear** in which social relations
are structured on the basis of distrust]{.underline}" (Huysmans 2006).\
(i.b) Second, [if the **rhetoric of a competitive, 'winner takes all' AI
race** is used in the absence of an actual race, it **could contribute
to sparking such a race.**]{.underline}

\(ii\) Risks Posed by a Race Emerging If the rhetoric of a race for
technological advantage became an actual race to develop sophisticated
AI, the risks increase further:\
(ii.a) First, there is the risk that [racing to achieve powerful AI
would not be conducive to taking]{.underline} the [proper safety
precautions]{.underline} that such technology will require (Armstrong,
Bostrom, and Shulman 2016). We mentioned above the need for broad
consultation about the role AI should play in the life of a community.
This might help address important considerations such as avoiding biased
systems, or maximising fairness. But in addition to these goals,
[serious attention must also be given to ensuring humans do not lose
control of systems.]{.underline} Such considerations become particularly
important if AI approaches general intelligence or superintelligence
(Bostrom 2014), but also long before, particularly when AI systems are
performing critical functions. The risk is that [as the **perceived
benefit** to winning the race **increases**, so correspondingly does the
**incentive to cut corners** on these safety
considerations.\]{.underline}
(ii.b) Second, a ['race for technological advantage' could increase the
risk of competition in AI causing real conflict]{.underline} (overt or
covert). Huysmans argues that [militarised language]{.underline} such as
this [has "a specific capacity for fabricating and **sustaining
antagonistic relations** between groups]{.underline}. In the case of the
race for technological advantage, [it encourages us to see competitors
as **threats** or even **enemies**]{.underline}. The belief that a
country intends in earnest to win an AI race, and that this would result
in technological dominance, could, for example, prompt other countries
to use aggression to prevent this (akin to the cyberattacks made against
Iranian nuclear facilities attributed to the US and Israel) (Nakashima
2012), or motivate the targeting of key personnel (precedents \-- though
specific to their historical context \-- might include Operation
Paperclip, during which over 1,600 German scientists and engineers who
had worked on military technology were taken to the US (Jacobsen 2014),
or the apparently ongoing operations to encourage the defection of
nuclear scientists between nations) (Golden 2017). Such scenarios would
also in- crease the risk that a general race for technological
superiority became increasingly a military AI arms race.

\(iii\) Risks Posed by Race Victory [The third category of risks of an
AI race for technological superiority are those that would arise if a
race were won]{.underline}. We will not explore these in detail here \--
and the forms they take will anyway depend on the precise nature of the
technology in question. But as an example, [these risks include the
**concentration of power** in the hands of whatever group possesses this
transformative technology]{.underline}. If we survey the current
international landscape, and [consider the number of countries
demonstrably willing to use force against others]{.underline}, [as well
as the speed with which political direction within a country can change,
and the persistence of non-state actors such as terrorist
groups,]{.underline} we might conclude that [the number of groups we
would not trust to responsibly manage an overwhelming technological
advantage exceeds the number we would]{.underline}.

Current Military AI Competition Is Not an "Arms Race"

As Heather Roff has written, [the arms race framing "misrepresents the
competition going on among countries."]{.underline} To begin with, [AI
is not a weapon]{.underline}. [AI is a general-purpose enabling
technology]{.underline} with myriad applications. It is [not like a
missile or a tank]{.underline}. It is more like electricity, the
internal combustion engine, or computer networks.6 General-purpose
[technologies like AI have applications across a range of
industries]{.underline}. Wired magazine co-founder Kevin Kelly has
argued that it "will enliven inert objects, much as electricity did more
than a century ago. Everything that we formerly electrified we will now
cognitize."7

Nations may very well be in a technology race to adopt AI across a range
of industries. [AI will help to improve economic productivity
and]{.underline}, by extension, [economic and military
power]{.underline}. During the industrial revolution, early adopters of
industrial technology significantly increased their national power. From
1830 to 1890, Britain and Germany, which were both early
industrializers, more than doubled their per capita gross national
product while Russia, which lagged in industrialization, increased its
per capita gross national product by a mere 7 percent over that 60-year
period.8 These technological advantages led to increased economic and
military power, most notably for Europe relative to the rest of the
world. In 1790, Europe (collectively), China, and India (including what
is now Pakistan and Bangladesh) held roughly the same shares of global
manufacturing output, with Europe and India each holding about
one-quarter of global manufacturing output and China holding roughly
one-third. They all had approximately equivalent levels of per capita
industrialization at that time. But the industrial revolution
skyrocketed European economic productivity. By 1900, Europe collectively
controlled 62 percent of global manufacturing output, while China held
only six percent and India less than two percent. These economic
advantages translated into military power. By 1914, Europeans occupied
or controlled over 80 percent of the world's land surface.9

Being ahead of the curve in adopting AI is likely to lead to significant
national advantages. [Although AI can increase military capabilities,
the more consequential advantages over the long term may come from
non-military AI applications]{.underline} across society. [Long-term
benefits]{.underline} from AI [could include increased productivity,
improved healthcare outcomes, economic growth]{.underline}, and other
indicators of national well-being. Increasing productivity is especially
significant because it has a compounding effect on economic growth. Over
the long term, [technological progress is the main driver of economic
growth]{.underline}.10

Of course, [AI can also be used for weapons]{.underline}. Militaries
around the world are actively working to adopt AI to improve their
military capabilities. [Yet the **militarization of AI does
not**]{.underline}, at present, **[meet the traditional definition of an
arms race]{.underline}**, [despite the rhetorical urgency of many
national leaders.]{.underline} Michael D. Wallace, in his 1979 article
"Arms Races and Escalation," defined an arms race as "involving
simultaneous abnormal rates of growth in the military outlays of two or
more nations" resulting from "the competitive pressure of the military
itself, and not from domestic forces exogenous to this rivalry." Wallace
further stated that the concept of an arms race only applied "between
nations whose foreign and defense policies are heavily interdependent"
and who have "roughly comparable" capabilities.11 [AI is being adopted
by many countries around the globe]{.underline}.12 Arguably at least
[some]{.underline} of the [dyads]{.underline}, [such as the United
States and China]{.underline}, [meet Wallace's definition in terms
of]{.underline} being nations with ["roughly comparable"
capabilities]{.underline}, [locked in competition]{.underline}, "[whose
foreign and defense policies are heavily interdependent."]{.underline}
[However]{.underline}, [AI **fails** the arms race test in the critical
area of spending]{.underline}.

Wallace distinguished arms races from the normal behavior of states to
improve their military forces. [A state that adopts a new technology and
modernizes its military forces is not automatically in an arms
race]{.underline}, under Wallace's definition, even if the modernization
is aimed at competition with another country. [The decisive factor in
qualifying as an arms race]{.underline}, according to Wallace, [is the
rate of growth in defense spending.]{.underline} Wallace characterized
arms races as resulting in abnormally large growth rates in defense
spending, beyond the historical average of 4 to 5 percent annual growth
(in real dollars). In an arms race, annual growth rates are above 10
percent or even as high as 20 to 25 percent.13 Other scholars define
arms races using different quantitative thresholds --- and some
definitions lack clear quantitative thresholds at all --- but [the
existence of rapid increases in defense spending or military forces
above normal levels is a common criterion in the scholarly literature on
arms races]{.underline}.14

Arms races result in situations in which two or more countries are
locked in spiraling defense spending, grabbing ever-greater shares of
national treasure often with little to no net gain in relative advantage
over the other. Classic historical examples include the Anglo-German
naval arms race prior to World War I and the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms
race during the Cold War. [Military AI spending today clearly does not
meet these criteria of abnormally large growth rates in defense
spending]{.underline}. [AI defense spending is difficult to calculate
due to the general-purpose nature of AI technology]{.underline}. Unlike
ships or ballistic missiles, [AI systems cannot be easily
counted]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [even crude estimates of defense
spending show that military AI investments are nowhere near large enough
to constitute an arms race.]{.underline} An independent estimate by
Bloomberg Government of U.S. defense spending on AI identified \$5
billion in AI-related research and development in fiscal year 2020, or
roughly 0.7 percent of the Department of Defense's over \$700 billion
budget.15 [The scale of military AI spending]{.underline}, at least at
present, [is nowhere near large enough to warrant the title of "arms
race."]{.underline} (Adding in private sector spending, which
constitutes the bulk of AI investment, would lead to larger figures but
would further belie the claim of an "arms" race since most private
sector AI investment is not in weapons.)

An Accelerating Tempo of Warfare

One possibility for how [AI could alter warfare]{.underline} in a manner
that would leave all states worse off would be [if it accelerated the
tempo of war past the point of human control, making warfare faster,
more violent, and less controllable.]{.underline} There are advantages
to adding intelligence into machines, but given the limitations of AI
systems today, the optimal model for achieving the highest quality
decision-making would be a joint human-machine architecture that
combines human and machine decision-making. [One way in which machines
outperform humans]{.underline}, however, [is in speed]{.underline}. [It
is possible to envision a competitive dynamic in which countries feel
compelled to automate increasing amounts of their military operations in
order to keep pace with adversaries.]{.underline} Then-Deputy Secretary
of Defense Robert O. Work summed up the dilemma when he asked, "If our
competitors go to Terminators and we are still operating where the
machines are helping the humans and it turns out the Terminators are
able to make decisions faster, even if they're bad, how would we
respond?"22 [This is a classic security dilemma.]{.underline} [One
state's pursuit of greater automation and faster reaction times
undermines other state's security and leads them to similarly pursue
more automation just to keep up.]{.underline}

If states fall victim to this trap[, it could lead to all states being
less secure]{.underline}, since [the pursuit of greater automation would
not merely be an evolution in weapons and countermeasures that simply
leads to the creation of new weapons in the future.]{.underline} At some
point, [warfare could shift to a qualitatively different regime in which
humans have less control over lethal force as decisions become more
automated and the accelerating tempo of operations pushes humans "out of
the loop" of decision-making.]{.underline} Some Chinese scholars have
hypothesized about a battlefield "singularity," in which the pace of
combat eclipses human decision-making.23 [U.S. scholars have used the
term "hyperwar"]{.underline} to refer to a similar scenario.24 [While
the speed of engagement necessitates automation in some limited
areas]{.underline} today, such as immediate localized defense of ships,
bases, and vehicles from rocket and missile attack, [expanding this zone
of machine control into broader areas of war would be a significant
development.]{.underline} [Less human control]{.underline} over warfare
[could lead to wars that are less controllable and that escalate more
quickly or more widely]{.underline} than humans intend. Similarly,
[limiting escalation or terminating conflicts could be more
challenging]{.underline} if the pace of operations on the battlefield
exceeds human decision-making. [Political leaders would have a
command-and-control problem in which their military forces are operating
"inside"]{.underline} (i.e., faster than) [their own decision
cycle]{.underline}. The [net effect of the quite rational desire for
nations to gain an edge in speed could lead to an outcome that is worse
for all.]{.underline} Yet, competitive dynamics could nevertheless drive
such a result.

Financial markets provide an example of this dynamic in a non-military
competitive environment. Automation introduced into financial markets,
especially high-frequency trading in which trades are executed at
super-human speeds in milliseconds, has contributed to unstable market
conditions that can lead to "flash crashes," in which prices rapidly and
dramatically shift.25 Financial regulators have responded by employing
"circuit breakers" that automatically halt trading for a pre-determined
period of time if the price moves too quickly.26 Financial markets have
the benefit of a regulator who can force cooperative measures on
competitors to address suboptimal outcomes. Under conditions of anarchy
in the international security environment, any such cooperation would
have to come from states themselves.

The dynamic of a competition in speed is like an arms race, if we expand
the definition of an arms race to be more in line with biological
examples of competitive co-evolution. Biologists often use the metaphor
of an arms race to explain "an unstable runaway escalation" of
adaptation and counter-adaption that can occur in animals.27 This can
occur between species, such as predator and prey, or within species,
such as males evolving in competition for females. Biological arms races
can manifest in a variety of ways, such as competitions between predator
and prey with regard to camouflage vs. detection and armor vs. claws, as
well as speed, cognitive abilities, poison, deception, or other
attributes that might increase chances of survival.28 This broader
biological definition of an arms race is more in line with [the
potential for an escalating "arms race in speed"]{.underline} among
nations that leads to greater automation in warfare. While this concept
does not meet the traditional definition of an arms race in the security
studies literature, it [is]{.underline} nevertheless [a useful concept
to describe the potential for a co-evolution in speed that leads to no
net relative advantage and in fact may leave both sides worse
off.]{.underline}

Alternatives to a Race Approach

[If we are not to pursue (and talk about pursuing) AI development as a
race, then how should we pursue (and talk about pursuing) such
development?]{.underline} This is too big a topic to consider thoroughly
here. But we note these promising directions for alternative narratives
around progress in, and benefits of, AI:

AI Development as a Shared Priority for Global Good

As advances in AI find application to an ever-wider range of scientific
and societal challenges, there is a burgeoning discussion around
harnessing the benefits of AI for global benefit. This reflects a
widespread view among AI scientists and a growing number of policymakers
that [AI presents tremendous opportunities for making progress on global
societal ills, and aiding in tackling some of the biggest challenges we
face in the coming century]{.underline} \-- [among them **climate
change** and clean **energy production**, **biodiversity loss**,
**healthcare**, **global poverty** and **education**]{.underline}.
[Emphasising these benefits could **counteract a race approach** in a
number of ways:]{.underline} First, [if there is global scientific
consensus that some of the key aims of AI should be to benefit humanity
in these ways, then it becomes less important in which companies or
countries key breakthroughs occur.]{.underline} Second, [it makes clear
that cooperation on the development of AI stands to result in faster
progress on these pressing challenges]{.underline}. Lastly, [if the aims
of the field are to benefit humanity worldwide, then the global
community represent stakeholders in the process of AI development; this
narrative therefore promotes **inclusive and collaborative development**
and deployment of AI.]{.underline}

Cooperation on AI as it is Applied to Increasingly Safety-Critical
Settings Globally

[The next decade will see AI applied in an increasingly integral way to
safety-critical systems; healthcare, transport,
infrastructure]{.underline} to name a few. [In order to realise these
benefits as quickly and safely as possible, **sharing of research,
datasets, and best practices** will be critical]{.underline}. For
example, to ensure the safety of autonomous cars, pooling expertise and
datasets on vehicle performances across as wide as possible a range of
environments and conditions (including accidents and near-accidents)
would provide substantial benefits for all involved. This is
particularly so given that the [research, data, and testing needed to
refine and ensure the safety of such systems before
deployment]{.underline} may be considerably more costly and
time-consuming than the research needed to develop the initial
technological capability. [Promoting recognition that deep cooperation
of this nature is needed to deliver the benefits of AI robustly may be a
powerful tool in **dispelling a 'technological race'
narrative**]{.underline}; and [a **'cooperation for safe AI' framing**
is likely to become increasingly important as more powerful and broadly
capable AI systems are developed and deployed.]{.underline}

Responsible Development of AI and Public Perception

AI is the focus for a growing range of public concerns as well as
optimism (Ipsos MORI 2017, Fast and Horvitz 2017). Many stakeholders,
including in industry, recognise the importance of public trust in the
safety and benefits offered by AI if it is to be deployed successfully
(Banavar 2017). It is the view of the authors that [a narrative focused
on **global cooperation** and **safe**, **responsible** **development**
of AI is likely to inspire greater public confidence than a narrative
focused more on technological dominance or leadership]{.underline}.
Other powerful new technologies, such as genetically modified organisms
and nuclear power, have in the past proven controversial, with
significant communities arguing for a cautious, safety-first approach,
to which the rhetoric of the race is antithetical.

Recent Narratives

There have been encouraging developments promoting the above narratives
in recent years. '[AI for global benefit' is perhaps best exemplified by
the 2017's ITU summit on AI for Global Good]{.underline} (Butler 2017),
although it also features prominently in narratives being put forward by
the IEEE's Ethically Aligned Design process (IEEE 2016), the Partnership
on AI, and programmes and materials put forward by Microsoft, DeepMind
and other leading companies. Collaboration on AI in safetycritical
settings is also a thematic pillar for the Partnership on AI2 . Even
more ambitious cooperative projects have been proposed by others, for
example the call for a 'CERN for AI' from Professor Gary Marcus, through
which participants "share their results with the world, rather than
restricting them to a single country or corporation" (Marcus 2017).
Finally, [the overall narrative of cooperation was clearly expressed in
a statement issued by a Beneficial AI conference in Tokyo]{.underline}3
: The challenges of ensuring that \[AI\] is beneficial are challenges
for us all. We urge that these challenges be addressed in a spirit of
cooperation, not competition. (Beneficial AI Tokyo, 2017).

Conclusion

Although artificial intelligence has been discussed for decades, only
recently has it received serious and sustained attention from
governments, industry and the media. Among the various ways in which
this technology is framed, [we have highlighted one that we consider to
be potentially dangerous: that of the race for technological
advantage.]{.underline} Partly, we believe that [a general race to
develop AI would be dangerous because it would also
encompass]{.underline} \-- given the dual use of this technology \-- [a
literal, military arms race]{.underline}. But even if this were not the
case, we believe there would be risks -- e.g. from corner-cutting in
safety and consultation. Although some might argue that the research
community should altogether avoid using AI 'race' terminology for fear
of giving it currency, we believe that the idea is already current
enough to justify interventions that draw attention to the dangers. Much
work remains to be done in understanding the dynamics of a possible
race, and in developing alternative framings for AI development \-- but
there are encouraging examples on which to build.

[In his]{.underline} public [announcements]{.underline} on the matter
[Bush brings together the established **motifs**]{.underline} of
**[unpredictability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} probable
**[catastrophic consequences]{.underline}** [with the]{.underline}
requisite [admission of resignation in the face of the
**inevitable**]{.underline} (it is by now too late to mass-produce
vaccines, stock up on sufficient antivirals, or rehabilitate the public
health service). All of which, in a now familiar unfolding of logic,
adds up to the necessity for preventive (read \"preemptive\") action.
Specifically, [Bush]{.underline} has [suggested that the]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense [should]{.underline} be authorized to
[forcibly **isolate**]{.underline}, [evacuate, and **quarantine**

pandemic. ECONOMIES OF EMERGENCE In the mid-1990s [the]{.underline}
official [rate of]{.underline} U.S. [productivity growth]{.underline}
[suddenly **took off** in]{.underline} the statistics after a long
twenty-five-year slump, seeming to confirm that the \"information
revolution\" was indeed beginning to bear fruit. [This
sudden]{.underline} burst of [exuberance was hailed as the
**sign**]{.underline} of an **[emerging]{.underline}** postindustrial
**[revolution]{.underline}**, [whose two cutting-edge sectors
(**biotech**]{.underline}nology and information technology)
[would]{.underline} **[relaunch]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} U.S.
**[economy]{.underline}** [into]{.underline} a golden era of
**[indefinite growth]{.underline}**. As venture capital flooded into the
digital and biotechnologies, it seemed that
**[speculation]{.underline}** itself had [become the **driving** force
behind **unprecedented**]{.underline} levels of
**[innovation]{.underline}**, allowing whole industries to be financed
on the mere hope of future profits. W hat was at stake here, even
according to the most skeptical of observers, was m uch more than an
irrational bubble or the delirious financialization of the economy
(Brenner 2002). Far from representing a final abstraction of the virtual
from the tangible world of bodies, [the rise of **venture capitalism**
**institutionalized** a model of economic **growth** in which
**production** itself was made to hinge on the]{.underline}
**[vagaries]{.underline}** of [stock-market investment. This could not
have been more **evident**]{.underline} than [in the]{.underline}
**[biotech]{.underline}** [sector, w here the most m aterial of
**productions**]{.underline}---the experimental regeneration of life
itself---[became intimately infused w ith the virtual temporality of
**speculation**]{.underline}. The political theorist Christian Marazzi
has described the venture capital model of accumulation as an economy of
emergence, where the so-called fundamentals of production are replaced
by the traditional affective skills of the professional speculator---the
ability to sense and respond to crowd movements before they take hold;
to initiate new product lines before a m arket exists for them; to prom
ote belief, euphoria, or panic in the face of an event that has not yet
materialized. Marazzi (2002, 48-49) writes: \"Everyday productivity is
increasingly determ ined by the capacity to respond in unforeseen and
unforeseeable situations, emergent situations, those situations that
obviate any kind of programming and posit occasionality as central.\"23
[During the late]{.underline} 19**[90s]{.underline}**
[whole]{.underline} [sectors of the **economy**]{.underline} [were held
aloft on a wave of media]{.underline}-induced
**[expectation]{.underline}**--- [expectation of
**profit**]{.underline}, in the first place, [but]{.underline} also a
kind of [collective **faith**]{.underline} in the soon-to-be realized
**[possibilities]{.underline}** of the new information and
**[life]{.underline}** science **[technologies]{.underline}**. At a time
[when most biotech companies had yet to **develop** a marketable
**product**]{.underline}, [let alone]{.underline} make a
**[profit]{.underline}**, [capital]{.underline}
**[investment]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the new
[technologies]{.underline} [was sustained by the **hope**]{.underline}
that the Hum an Genome Project (HUGO) and genomics in general were about
to deliver an unheard-of revolution in health care, an era of designer
drugs and precision-targeted interventions into the germ line. In M arch
2000, though, the venture capital frenzy of the late 1990s came to a
fittingly millennial end w hen the dot-com stocks collapsed, followed
later in the same year by the mass anticapitalist protests in Seattle.24
It was in this atmosphere of impending political and economic crisis,
announcing the decline of the neoliberal triumphalism of the Clinton
era, that Bush came to power. In retrospect, it seems clear that the war
on terror was as m uch a political response to the downturn of the new
economy as to the terrorist attacks of September 11. Bush\'s answer to
the technophilic optimism of the Clinton era was an equally megalomaniac
plan for indefinite war, encompassing the whole globe within his
strategic vision. For a while venture [**capital**
continued]{.underline} to **[invest]{.underline}** in the life sciences,
[with the **lingering hope**]{.underline} that the promised new economic
growth would at least become tangible here. [But when
**HUGO**]{.underline} [and other]{.underline} genome [sequences were
published]{.underline}, [there was a sudden **sobering
consensus**]{.underline} [that the life sciences]{.underline} would need
to move into the \"post-genomic\" era before the anticipated medical
breakthroughs could be realized. [In 2003 the **fortunes** of
the]{.underline} **[biotech]{.underline}** **[sector
slumped]{.underline}** to an alltime low, [and at this point the U.S.
**government**]{.underline} [came to the **rescue**]{.underline} with a
[massive plan to fund]{.underline} \"**[biodefense\"
research]{.underline}** for the following ten years. The plan included
generous incentives for drug development that seemed as much designed to
overcome the time lags of commercialization as to counter the threat of
bioterrorism. New biodefense legislation made sure that any \"national
health emergency\" would become the perfect occasion for pushing through
a drug w ithout clinical trial.23 Biotech would live again, but this
time federal funding of life science research would be tagged to the new
strategic vision of the Bush administration. The long-neglected domains
of public health and infectious disease research would be rehabilitated
and merged with biodefense while venture capital investment would again
be courted, but this time on the pretext of perm anent war rather than
perm anent growth. The difference between **[Clinton\'s
neoliberalism]{.underline}** [and Bush\'s]{.underline}
**[neoconservatism]{.underline}** [needs to be qualified]{.underline}
then: **[both economies mobilize speculative affect]{.underline}**,
[attuning it to the **emergence** of the **unpredictable**]{.underline}.
What has changed is the affective valence of \"our\" relation to the
future---from euphoria to panic to fear, or rather alertness (that is, a
state of fear w ithout foreseeable end). W here the [celebrants of the
**new** economic]{.underline} **[growth]{.underline}** [reassured
investors that there was no **end** to **innovation**]{.underline},
[holding hope aloft with a constant **barrage** of]{.underline}
**[short-lived promises]{.underline}**, [the neoconservatives w ant to
**convince us** that there is]{.underline} **[no end to
danger]{.underline}**, [that the **war** against **terror**]{.underline}
can [only be **indefinite** in **time and scale**]{.underline}.26 In the
aftermath of September 11, **[permanent warfare has become the new
driving force behind U.S. economic growth]{.underline}**, [feeding off
its own **ineptitude** as it generates a]{.underline} seemingly
**[inexhaustible]{.underline}** dem and for **[security
services]{.underline}** of all kinds. Within this new configuration of
powers, the life sciences have been promoted to a commanding position.
The Bush administration has achieved something the theorists of
Clinton\'s new intelligence agenda only ever dreamed of---the actual
institutional conflation of security and public health research,
military strategy, environmental politics, and the innovation economy.27
W hat is being articulated here is a profoundly new strategic agenda
where war is no longer waged in the defense of the state (the Schmittian
philosophy of sovereign war) or even hum an life (humanitarian warfare;
the human as bare life, according to Giorgio Agamben \[1998\]), but
rather in the name of life in its biospheric dimension, incorporating
meteorology epidemiology and the evolution of all forms of life, [from
the **microbe up**]{.underline}. [The extension of **preemptive
warfare** to include]{.underline} the sphere of environmental and
**[biopolitics]{.underline}** [conflates the eternalization of w ar with
the **evolution** of **life** on earth]{.underline}--- **[as
if]{.underline}** [**permanent war** were simply a fact of life, **with
no other end than its own crisis-driven perpetuation**]{.underline}. [As
**Dick Cheney** has **said**: \"]{.underline}It **[may never
end]{.underline}**. At least not in our lifetime\" (quoted in Woodward
2001). [Inevitably, such a delirious **prognosis** on the **future** of
**warfare** demands th]{.underline}at we **[rethink]{.underline}** [the
shape of a possible **antiwar politics**]{.underline}. Perhaps, given
the recent nature of the events analyzed in this chapter, the
problematic of resistance can be most forcefully posed in the
interrogative form. What becomes of an antiwar politics when the sphere
of military action infiltrates the \"grey areas\" of everyday life,
contaminating our \"quality of life\" at the most elemental level
(Brower and Chalk 2003)? In w hat sense is it even possible now to claim
a right to \"life,\" social security, public health---the peculiarly
vital rights of the welfare state---w ithout falling into the trap of
legitimating permanent warfare? And [how do we counter a
**politics**]{.underline} [that turns the possibility of **ecological
crisis** into]{.underline} a **[tradable catastrophe risk]{.underline}**
[on the **capital markets**]{.underline}? [One response to these
questions has been to **redefine security**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} **[human]{.underline}**, biological, or even biospheric
**[terms]{.underline}**, as if this were the only way to salvage
something of the vitalist politics of the welfare state. But such a
strategy falls straight into the hands of the new intelligence agenda, w
ith its manic desire to revitalize and expand the scope of legitimate
security interventions. Rather than plead for a security politics w ith
a hum an face, then, a more promising vector of resistance lies in the
attem pt to underm ine the nexus betw een military security, the
politics of life, and new forms of speculative capitalization. In the
face of a politics that prefers to work in the speculative mode, w hat
is called for is something like a creative sabotage of the future; a
pragmatics of preemptive resistance capable of actualizing the future
outside of the policeable boundaries of property right. And in the face
of a politics that all too often adopts a posture of resignation in the
face of the biospheric catastrophe, it is imperative that we do not give
in to the sense of the inevitable. Neoliberalism has a vested interested
in selective fatalism. Perhaps then the task of a counterpolitics is
twofold: w herever possible, all efforts should be made to undermine the
foregone conclusion, and w hen all else fails, the aim should be to
reroute the catastrophe tow ard m ore interesting ends (catastrophes
often become the occasion for renewing and creating countercommunities).
This is an abstract formula for resistance that applies to such diverse
questions as the capitalization of health and old age insurance;
biological patents of all kinds; and even the commercialization of the
\"elements,\" from privatized water to tradable pollution rights and
environm ental catastrophe bonds. Such a formula could describe any num
ber of recent conflicts around the neoliberal politics of life, from the
court case opposing AIDS activists to pharmaceutical companies in South
Africa; to the revival of popular pharmacologies in the face of the
depredations of a global drug market; and to projects in open source
biology initiated by scientists across the life sciences, to nam e but a
few. What is new about the current context, however, is the creeping
militarization of these sites of biopolitical tension. [The **domains**
of **life** that **neolib**eralism]{.underline} has
**[sought]{.underline}** [to incorporate into
**commercial**]{.underline} and **[trade]{.underline}** law [over the
past two decades are now being **forcibly recruited**]{.underline} [into

[In the]{.underline} commercially driven [process of **securitizing
health, knowledge production**]{.underline} [plays a **crucial
role**]{.underline}, [operating both as a tool and a good]{.underline}.
[**Security** as a commodity requires the consumer]{.underline} (here
the public, the state and the medical profession) [to
**buy**]{.underline} (literally) [into a belief that the **security
products**]{.underline} [offered are **effective** in
**obviating**]{.underline} [or at least weakening the risk of
**disease** or illness]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} further
[involves ensuring that any risk involved in **consuming** the
**product**]{.underline}, in this case the vaccine, is overridden by the
threat posed by the disease against which it is affording protection.
[Creating a vigorous **market** for]{.underline} [business in a
competitive environment]{.underline}, [as studies of corporate crime
have consistently shown, can involve a range of **deviant** and criminal
**strategies**]{.underline} and activities, including fraud, corruption,
intimidation and bribery, activities that are ubiquitous and, in some
cases, systemic within industry. Historically '**[Big
Pharma']{.underline}** [has a poor track record for ethical
behaviour]{.underline} (Braithwaite 1984; Dukes et al. 2014; Gotzsche
2013; Griffin and Miller 2011). Healy observes that unlike other
health-risk businesses such as tobacco and the chemicals industry, in
which 'the best studies systematically point to hazards where they
exist' and where company studies tend to be a small component of
evidence-production, often viewed with suspicion as being partial, the
same does not pertain to the pharmaceutical industry:

> with pharmaceuticals often the only studies are those of the drug
> companies themselves, and these studies, as one might expect, all seem
> to point to the benefits of an ongoing use of the very chemicals that
> may in fact be causing the problem.

(Healy 2012: 119)

Alongside vested-interest knowledge production, [the]{.underline}
**[pharma]{.underline}**ceutical [industry engages in **other**
nefarious **activities**]{.underline}. [These include **obstructing**
the **publication** of **negative data**]{.underline} [from clinical
trials in **medical journals**]{.underline}, [which are often
financially **dependent** on **industry**]{.underline} [for advertising
and the sale of reprints]{.underline}; [intimidating **whistle-blowers**
amongst medical researchers and doctors **concerned** about
the]{.underline} **[safety of particular drugs]{.underline}**; and the
ubiquitous practice of aggressively promoting products to the medical
profession including providing financial inducements to win support for
a particular drug (Gotzsche 2013; Healy 2012; Moynihan 2001). Nor are
these deviant and harmful practices occasional aberrations, but instead
reflect recidivist behaviour embedded within the industry (Braithwaite
1984; Dukes et al. 2014).

[Despite a long history of **insalubrious behaviour**]{.underline} [in
the pharmaindustry, governments and intergovernmental organizations such
as the **WHO**]{.underline} [continue to focus on pharmaceuticalized
solutions to what are arguably]{.underline} **[pharmaceutically
constructed]{.underline}** [health **risks**]{.underline}. [While
obfuscating or down-playing the safety issues around the escalating
**administration** of **medical interventions**]{.underline}, [the
pharmaindustry's intensified **participation**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} **[research]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[policy]{.underline}**-making [enables it to **construct** narratives
of **high risk**]{.underline} [around both the nature of
**diseases**]{.underline} [and their **prevalence**, and exaggerate the
efficacy of its **products**, thereby creating an **ever-expanding
market** (Healy 2012; Gotzsche 2013]{.underline}). This is especially
the case in a product that is administered to a population. The vaccine
industry is highly profitable not only because of its numerical reach
but because, in an increasing range of jurisdictions, vaccines carry a
mandatory status.

[These policies]{.underline}, which for critics of mandatory medical
intervention, are [regarded as a **blatant violation** of **human
rights**]{.underline}, [have been legitimized through the discursive
**modalities** of **securitization**]{.underline}, in much the same way
that torture and extraordinary rendition were reconstructed as necessary
for the protection of the very phenomena they were consistently eroding
(Chossudovsky 2005). In both cases, where the market operates as a
crucial driver, in which defensive mechanisms are for sale, whether
vaccines or arms, there must be no limitation to demand. Creating demand
through the security narrative and ensuring supply through mandate
enables the constant proliferation of an industry which simultaneously
protects and destroys. Excessive protection can only lead to destruction
(consider the proliferation of nuclear arms during the Cold War in what
was termed MAD -- mutually assured destruction). Esposito captures this
in his consideration of the process of over-immunization as a political,
juridical as well as bio-political phenomenon, whereby 'the warring
potential of the immune system is so great that at a certain point it
turns against itself as a real and symbolic catastrophe leading to the
implosion of the whole organism' (2011: 17). Yet, as has been made clear
in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the voracious appetite
of the market in its neoliberal manifestation continues apace ignoring
the social and economic cannibalism of excessive profit-seeking. For the
pharmaindustry that involves the presence, real or imaginary, of a
constant threat of disease and infection.

State of infection

In its 2006 action plan to 'increase vaccine supply' the WHO informs us
that 'Influenza vaccine development and employment are critical elements
of pandemic influenza preparedness'. In explaining how serious this risk
of a pandemic actually is, and the consequent justification for spending
billions of dollars on flu vaccines globally, [the WHO slips into
'**Rumsfeldian discourse'** describing the 'the global **burden**
of]{.underline} seasonal **[influenza']{.underline}** [as an
'**unknown'**]{.underline} (WHO 2006[). We are now familiar with
unknowns]{.underline} in their both knowable and unknowable states as
being crucial to the extension of state power with its affiliate abuses.
[The]{.underline} 'unknown [burden']{.underline} of seasonal flu [has
occasioned not only the mass manufacture]{.underline} [of a]{.underline}
**[vaccine]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}, in its current stage of
development [has proven to be **less than effective**]{.underline}
(Gallagher 2015), [but also the introduction of **mandatory policies**
around]{.underline} the **[influenza]{.underline}** [vaccine for health
workers and other **professionals**]{.underline} (Babcock et al. 2010).
Indeed, [mandating a range of **vaccines**]{.underline} [has now become
**established practice**]{.underline} [in a number of
countries]{.underline} including the US, Australia, France and Canada,
with the UK being a notable exception.

Mandatory creep has been occurring over the past few decades, overriding
the hitherto right to abstain from vaccination programmes on the basis
of religious or 'conscientious objection' (a term originally used for
nineteenth-century vaccine objectors and subsequently adopted by the
military for those who refused compulsory conscription on similar
grounds) in many cases leaving medical exemption the only acceptable
criterion for refusal. Vaccine programmes involve mass immunization or
herd immunity in which a large percentage of the population is required
to be vaccinated against a disease to ensure its control and hopefully
gradual eradication, thereby protecting those who cannot be vaccinated
against possible infection. Unlike other medical interventions, the
focus here lies on the protection of the population rather than an
individual. For Foucault, immunization represents a distinctive break
from other medical relationships which seek to heal the individual, but
operates as 'a way of individualizing the collective phenomenon of the
disease, or of collectivizing the phenomena, integrating individual
phenomena within a collective field, but in the form of the rational and
identifiable' (2004: 60). This brings another dimension to the
philosophy of reponsibilization that dominates the neoliberal concept of
health, a paradoxical position that transforms individual accountability
into sacrifice (for even the strongest advocates of mandatory
vaccination admit there is no such thing as one hundred per cent
safety). It is a subtly crafted moral sleight of hand that turns
adherence to the market of and for pharmatechnologies into an abnegation
of self, where the self operates not simply as part of the collective
but as subservient to it: capitalism functioning through a 'communist'
guise. Human rights can thus be dismissed as 'nonsense upon stilts' or
perhaps worse still, as the greatest threat to human rights itself.

Given that the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights emerged from inter alia
some of the most horrific medical abuses ever recorded it is even more
ironic that the policy of mandatory vaccination is proliferating. It
contravenes human rights contained within a number of conventions which
establish individual autonomy regarding medical intervention. This
includes Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights on the
respect for one's private life, that is 'the right not to be physically
interfered with' (Liberty 2015) and more specifically, the International
Covenant on Political and Civil Rights protection against 'torture or to
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no
one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific
experimentation' (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
1966).

[The]{.underline} combined [rhetoric of **security**]{.underline} and
science, [fundamental to the justification and **waging of
war**]{.underline}, [not only assuages the retraction of human
**rights** obligations]{.underline} [by the state but can **render these
rights** themselves]{.underline} **[as presenting a
threat]{.underline}**. [As the war on **disease**]{.underline}, together
with that on terror, [has no defined]{.underline} [**end**, no clear
moment of]{.underline} **[victory]{.underline}**, [being non-territorial
insofar as it has **no** physical **jurisdiction**]{.underline}, [the
suspension or weakening of human **rights**]{.underline} [will continue
and further entrench the 'paradigm of **security** as the]{.underline}
**[normal technique of government']{.underline}** (Agamben 2005: 14). In
this [environment vaccine objection easily slips into **criminalized
activity**]{.underline} [and criticism appears as
**unpatriotic**]{.underline}. [Concerns over conflict of interest,
**data** manipulation,]{.underline} **[bribery]{.underline}** [and
intimidation are turned into **politicized opposition**]{.underline}
[and those who voice these concerns become **enemies of the
people**]{.underline}, **[a security threat]{.underline}**, **[health
terrorists]{.underline}**. In this context, punitive measures against
those who refuse, both for themselves or on behalf of those under their
guardianship, are also becoming more draconian and can range from
financial penalties, the exclusion of children from day care centres,
loss of jobs (within the medical profession) or even prison (Willsher
2014).

Informed consent lies at the heart of the numerous instruments for the
protection of the human body; the notion of bodily integrity underpins a
series of rights that have been allocated to citizens in democratic
states, including the right to abortion. When the information aspect of
informed is either denied or contains negative data concerning safety it
is rational to assume that consent might not be always forthcoming.
Collusion between industry and politics is a major concern, as
Eisenhower warned. Mary Holland's critique of mandatory vaccination lays
out the extent of these collusive relationships in the US, which were
even admitted by politicians themselves:

> In 2000, a Congressional report on Conflicts of Interest in Vaccine
> Policy Making identified notable conflicts of interests in the FDA
> \[Federal\] and CDC \[Center for Disease Control\] advisory bodies
> that make national vaccine policy. These include 'advisers' financial
> ties to vaccine manufacturers' as well as 'advisers' permitted stock
> ownership in companies affected by their decisions'.

(Holland 2012:77)

Declaring these activities in Congress has not deterred their
occurrence. In 2007, an attempt was made by the erstwhile Governor of
Texas, Rick Perry, to mandate the HPV vaccine in his state's schools, a
decision he was subsequently forced to overturn when it was revealed
that Merck, the company that produced the Gardasil vaccine, had given
donations towards his nomination (Eggen 2011). Nor will this be the last
cosy relationship between politics and industry as mandatory vaccination
policy continues to be applied to an increasing number of vaccines.

Conclusion

**[Pharmatechnologies]{.underline}** [manifesting as medical
**research**]{.underline}, **[drug production]{.underline}** [and
distribution, epistemological paradigms determining how **health**,
**disease** and **risk are** to be **conceptualized**]{.underline} [and
negotiated, have now become a mode of **governance** in an increasingly
**authoritarian environment**. This is not to detract from the
**benefits** accrued from **medical progress**]{.underline} [through
pharmaceuticals and the important role played by vaccines in alleviating
potential suffering. Yet, the **benign discourses** within which they
**operate** can]{.underline} [often **obscure harmful
outcomes**]{.underline}, [harms imposed as structural violence: opaque,
**unidentifiable**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[normalized]{.underline}** (Žižek 2009). [Victimization remains unseen
or as a necessary price to pay for the **greater good.** In
medical]{.underline} [terms aspects of these harms are referred to as
iatrogenesis, the unintended, often injurious,
**consequences**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[medical
intervention]{.underline}**. [In this latter context it is akin to what
military circles euphemistically term '**collateral damage'**, generally
applied to the **killing** and]{.underline} maiming of
**[noncombatants]{.underline}**. [However, some scholars who study
**state** and **corporate harms**]{.underline} [are less inclined to
semantic generosity, not least when the majority of damage and injury
inflicted falls on the same targets, the **socio-economically
vulnerable**]{.underline}, gendered, racial, ethnic or other minorities
whose lot it is to comprise the flotsam and jetsam of ruthless markets
and the politics of indifference. Intention, or lack of, as they argue,
cannot disguise the power relations at play as the usual suspects emerge
as perpetrators and beneficiaries of systemic abuses.

If [we are to accept the argument]{.underline} put forward by Tombs and
Whyte that '[The problems caused by corporations -- which seriously
threaten the **stability of our lives**]{.underline} -- ...
[are]{.underline} **[enduring]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[necessary]{.underline}** functions of the corporation' (2015: 4),
[a]{.underline} [position supported by a plethora of cases]{.underline},
then all industry operating within a capitalist framework is
intrinsically pathological. [It is essentially a **diseased
entity**]{.underline}, irrespective of the nature of goods and services
produced or the rhetoric that designates it as benign. [Ironically, this
diseased entity in **combination** with an **increasingly diseased
political system**]{.underline}, [proclaims and even persists that it
has both the **authority**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[ability]{.underline}** [to produce and sell **health**]{.underline}.
[Yet, so strong is the belief in pharmaceuticalized health that **so
many** literally buy into]{.underline} the '**[truths']{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[pharmatechnologies failing]{.underline}** [miserably
to discern how the **contagion**-riddled]{.underline}
**[commodification]{.underline}** [of health is actually the greatest
**danger** to **health**]{.underline}. No business thrives on the
elimination of demand for its goods. The technologies of war were
justified through the eventual establishment of peace; so too the
pharmaindustry legitimizes its existence through claims to health and
healing. The existence of both is dependent on the perpetuation of the
very phenomena they claim to defend us from, and in this they must
continue to be producers of war and sickness. [No longer does the
potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exist, as
Eisenhower warned, it has become **fundamental** to the **industries of
war** and **disease**, to **war on disease**]{.underline}.

#### Framing HIV/AIDS as a national security threat creates a biopoliticized security apparatus that targets colonized peoples

[In 2005, Peter Piot, head of UNAIDS, the United Nations body charged
with coordinating HIV/AIDS initiatives across the UN system, recounted
the evolution of his political strategy for mobilizing national
governments to do more to address their respective epidemics and
endemic]{.underline}s (Council on Foreign Relations, 2005a[). Following
his appointment upon the creation of UNAIDS in 1996, he tended to be
directed towards ministries of health, as HIV/AIDS was regarded mainly
as a health problem]{.underline}. But those ministries were generally
marginal in the political dynamics of heavily affected states. [Framing
HIV/AIDS as a threat to national security, however, opened up new kinds
of political access and interest]{.underline}. [**In making the case
that HIV/AIDS was an issue of national security**, **Piot connected with
a narrative** propagated during the 1990s within the US by the
influential Institute of Medicine **about the need for the US to address
the problem of \'global emerging infectious diseases\'**]{.underline}
(including HIV/AIDS) **[as a matter of vital national
interes]{.underline}**t (King, 2002).

**[These narratives exploited and played into the wider transformation
of biopolitical security and facilitated the securitization of
HIV/AIDS]{.underline}**. A large and growing literature has emerged
examining putative connections between HIV/AIDS and security (summarized
and referenced extensively in Elbe, 2005,2006). **[Salient among the
propositions of the dominant HIV/AIDS-security discourse is the idea
that heavily affected societies will become increasingly prone to a
variety of social, economic, and crucially, military and political
crises that are likely to threaten development, stability and security
over the medium to long term]{.underline}**. [Africa (particularly its
eastern and southern states) has been the subject of most concern as the
place with the highest incidence and prevalence rates and, it would
seem, the most compelling prima facie evidence of HIV/AIDS-security
linkages.]{.underline} This has [included **the supposed potential of
AIDS to undermine the political fabric of countries with HIV prevalence
over 10%; its ability to undermine the combat effectiveness of military
and security forces (thought to be partic ularly at risk of HIV
infection and particular catalysts for its spread); and to undermine the
ability of countries to contribute to peacekeeping
forces**]{.underline}. Further [causal pathways have been postulated
around behaviours thought to be characteristic of military personnel
(engagement with commercial sex workers; general predisposition to risk
taking) and conflict-specific be haviours (use of rape as a weapon in
war]{.underline}). **[It has also been suggested that breakdown in
family structures and increases in the number of orphans as a result of
AIDS deaths might lead to increases in criminality and facilitate
recruitment into gangs and rebel groups]{.underline}**. [The cruder
accounts move easily between HIV/AIDS, economic devastation and a
supposed growing risk of \'terrorism\']{.underline} (Neilson, 2005).

[Concern has also been elaborated about the security implications of the
pandemic for countries and regions in the early- to mid- stages of
worsening epidemics]{.underline}. [Russia, India, China, Ethiopia and
Nigeria were identified as key states in the \'next wave\' of
HIV/AID]{.underline}S in a 2002 report by the NIC. **[This estimated
that these five countries would drive the number of people with HIV for
the rest of the decade, with the number infected growing from 14 to 23
million to an estimated 50 to 75 million by 2010]{.underline}** (NIC,
2002). In all the next wave states[, the rise in HIV/AIDS was predicted
to have significant economic, social, political and military
implications]{.underline}. In addition, [all five were recognized as
major regional or global players]{.underline}. [Ethiopia and Nigeria
were predicted to be the hardest hit, with the most advanced epidemics,
high rates of transmission and only limited public services to
mobilize]{.underline}. **[Their epidemics were predicted to decimate key
government and business elites, undermine growth and discourage foreign
investment.]{.underline}** [This discourse has produced a variety of
truth effects]{.underline} that have propagated through governance
networks and echoed back from target countries and institutions,
[influencing national and international responses.]{.underline} Elbe
(2006) has shown [how HIV/AIDS has in the terms of Buzan et al. (1998)
been securitized: a range of actors (international organizations,
governments and NGOs) accepted the idea that the survival of key
referent objects (communities, economies, elites, institutions,
militaries, \'security\') is threatened unless emergency measures are
undertaken]{.underline}. According to this approach, **[a successful
securitization takes HIV/AIDS out of the sphere of \'normal politics\'
and creates obligations to respond in ways that are adequate to the new
salience of the problem]{.underline}**. [This sense of urgency is
reflected in the names of the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria and the President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief.]{.underline} However, as Prins (2004: 939\^0) notes, \'During
the last twenty years there has often been an uneasy relationship
between the claim that an issue is important and the claim that it is a
\"security issue\"\'

**[Securitization theory raises questions first, about the
appropriateness of greater state involvement in securitized
issues]{.underline}** (Buzan et al, 1998: 29). Elbe notes that [\'In the
case of HIV/AIDS \... **framing the issue as a security issue pushes
responses to the disease away** from civil society **toward the much
less transparent workings of military and intelligence organizations\',
which can pave the way for the over-riding of civil
liberties**]{.underline} (2005: 128). Second, there are questions to do
with the \'threat-defence\' logic implicit in securitization. [In the
case of HIV/AIDS, Elbe suggests, this may remove the issue from more
cosmopolitan and altruistic frameworks to a context more concerned with
the maintenance of power, such that **states become concerned only about
health problems that engage their vital interests
directly**]{.underline}. [Elbe also considers possible benefits of
securitization, and argues that the main concerns apply in only a
qualified manner, and have to be weighed against competing
advantages]{.underline}. He argues that [in some of the most affected
countries, **the problem is not excessive state mobilization, but its
absence, with governments unable or unwilling to respond**]{.underline}
(see also Buzan and Waever, 2003: 237-8). **[Securitization may
therefore be a tool for the international community to push reluctant
governments to begin to save the lives of their citizens, with
democratizing rather than illiberal implications]{.underline}**;
[securitization represents a beginning to the \'proper politicization of
the issue\']{.underline} (Elbe, 2006: 132). [Greater involvement by the
more powerful elements of the state can be a help to this goal, not an
obstacle.]{.underline} Similarly, Elbe argues, [securitization \'assists
groups wishing to weaken the grip of patents on life-saving medicines
because \[according to article 73(b) of the WTO TRIPS agreement\] these
patents could potentially be overridden in light of national security
considerations\' (2006:133).]{.underline}

Elbe further acknowledges the reasoning that [it is often only when
faced with threats to self-interest that elites will act]{.underline}.
Similarly, he argues that **[so long as funding does not come at the
expense of civilian provision, concern about the military can generate
valuable resources.]{.underline}** Furthermore, [because military forces
are important actors in the pandemic itself they must be involved in
prevention strategies, **particularly as militaries are thought to be at
higher risk of infection and represent an important vector for
spread**]{.underline}. [So while]{.underline} [highlighting HIV/AIDS in
the military could have negative effects if it skews access to
treatment, prevention strategies must involve military
institutions]{.underline}. Finally[, securitization of the virus, rather
than HIV positive people themselves, might help to maintain a sense of
vigilance that is conducive to prevention]{.underline}. Elbe thus argues
that **[while securitizing HIV/AIDS carries risks, so does not
securitizing it]{.underline}**. He suggests therefore that **[HIV/AIDS
be viewed as a security issue, or an issue with an important security
dimension, rather than a dangerous and overwheling
threat]{.underline}**. Thus, [security should not be reified in relation
to HIV/AIDS, and human security and human rights should be used as
frameworks as well as national securit]{.underline}y. However, as Elbe
recognizes, **[\'the securitization of HIV/AIDS \... remains in the end
a risky gamble on the ability of those presenting HIV/ AIDS as a
security issue to maintain control over the uses to which this language
will be pu]{.underline}**t\' (2005: 416).

Elbe has also suggested that [the securitization of HIV/AIDS has turned
international security \'into a site for the global dissemination of a
biopolitical economy of power\']{.underline} (2005: 404). This renders
the biological characteristics of populations a matter of \'high\'
politics; sanctions an institutional apparatus of surveillance of the
world population; and invites the investment of a plethora of political
actors around the optimization of the health of populations. Following
Foucault further, Elbe argues that **[these biopolitical dimensions to
the securitization of HIV/AIDS could give rise to the ethical dangers of
normalization (through the targeting of sexual be haviour in AIDS
interventions) and new racisms (through the exclusion of HIV-positive
people and the targeting of relief on strategic groups) on a global
scale.]{.underline}**

[These interventions advance critical understanding of HIV/AIDS and
security in a number of ways]{.underline}. First, [they specify hitherto
under-theorized discursive and institutional power dynamics inherent in
international responses to HIV/AIDS and identify important connections
between actors, discourses and institution]{.underline}s. Second[, they
help in framing key political questions for the future of HIV/AIDS
relief]{.underline}. Third, [biopolitical analysis makes an important
contribution in bringing cultural and racial politics into work on the
security dimensions of HIV/ AIDS]{.underline}. Fourth, [the use of
biopolitics and securitization theory enables work on HIV/AIDS to
connect with other critical analyses of global security issues using
similar frameworks]{.underline}. I would suggest three further moves
that are required at this point. First is a more historicized approach
to the whole field of HIV/AIDS and security. For instance, attention has
been drawn to multiple continuities (as well as discontinuities) between
contemporary global health and the colonial era (Aginam, 2003; King,
2002). If, as McLeod (1988:3) suggests, colonial medical services formed
\'part of the political order they helped maintain\', there is
considerable room for clarification of the extent to which current
interventions proceed on discursive, institutional and geopolitical
terrains that have been prepared by earlier rounds of imperialism, and
how they are helping to modify them (Abrahamsen, 2003). In this
context**[, it is perhaps not so much that the military and security
agencies that have become more involved in HIV/AIDS are untransparent
and prone to over ride civil liberties (though they are), but that they
are already implicated in the production and protection of unequal world
orders and specific constellations of power/knowledge over an extended
period]{.underline}** (Bilgin and Morton, 2002; Smith, 2004). Another
focus for historicization, then, are the successive Western security
institutions and projects that have targeted many of the spaces
addressed by HIV/AIDS relief (not least \'next wave\' states) through
into the post-9/11 era

**[2NC\-\--AT: Threats Real]{.underline}**

**Even if the threat is real, securitization is perceived as hyperbole
hindering preparation. Independently, securitization trades off with
[community-based]{.underline} responses to infectious diseases which
turns the case.**

Political Science and is a research fellow at the Institute for the

Individual political and scientific experts also raised cautionary flags
about the direction and magnitude of our efforts to defend against
bioterrorism. Milton Leitenberg, trained as a scientist and an arms
control expert, prepared a detailed analysis of the Aum Shinrikyo
episode, in which he showed that far from representing the dawn of a new
and dangerous world in which "anyone could do it" bioterrorism would be
a major threat to humanity, it suggested something far different:

> [Aum]{.underline} utterly and [totally failed]{.underline} \[to
> produce biological weapons\], [after no]{.underline} small
> **[expenditure]{.underline}** [of time and money]{.underline}. . . .
> [The experience of Aum is]{.underline} . . . in [marked contrast

> [by]{.underline} **[senior]{.underline}** US government [officials and

> in]{.underline} "**[kitchens]{.underline}**," "bathrooms," "garages,"
> "home breweries," and is a matter of relative ease and simplicity. 17

This point was echoed by Amy Smithson, when she was Director of the
Stimson Center's Chemical and Biological Weapons Nonproliferation
Project:

Brian Jenkins, a terrorism expert with the RAND Corporation, has
repeatedly questioned the magnitude of the threat posed by bioterrorism.
He points out that, with the possible exception of Al-Qaeda, there has
been no indication that terrorist groups have seriously considered the
use of bioweapons as agents of terror.

But even Al-Qaeda's interest in bioweapons for terror purposes is open
to question. Consider the following statement by Ayman al- Zawahiri,
left behind on a computer in Kabul, Afghanistan after Al-Qaeda members
had fl ed in 2001:

> The enemy starting thinking about \[biological and chemical\] weapons
> before WWI. Despite their extreme danger, we only became aware of them
> when the enemy drew our attention to them by repeatedly expressing
> concerns that they can be produced simply with easily available
> materials.19

Terrorism expert Bruce Hoffman summed up the years of frantic
governmental spending on bioterrorism after it took off in the late
1990s:

> \[**[Bioterrorism]{.underline}**\] [was where the **funding
> was**]{.underline}, and [people were sticking their **hands in the
> pot**]{.underline}. [It was the sexiest of all the
> terrorism]{.underline} [threats and it was becoming]{.underline} **[a

> **[Washington politics]{.underline}** in the sense that [you generate

Many tried to remind us that [the]{.underline} **[real]{.underline}**
biological **[threat]{.underline}** to Americans [is]{.underline}, and
will continue to be, emerging [pathogens]{.underline}--- viruses like
[HIV]{.underline}, and possibly [H5N1]{.underline} avian influenza, or
other [pathogens]{.underline} that may [cross into the human
species]{.underline} in the future, and against which we have no innate
immunity. [We have known about]{.underline} the threat of an
[H5N1]{.underline} pandemic since the late 1990s. [Had we
spent]{.underline} **[\$40,000,000,000]{.underline}** [directly on
preparing ourselves to deal with the threat]{.underline} of emerging
**[pathogens]{.underline}**, [rather than]{.underline} many of the
**[quasi-military]{.underline}** defense [items]{.underline} associated
with bioterrorism, [we would]{.underline} probably [be as well
prepared]{.underline} for a [bioterrorist attack]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} certainly [better prepared for a **natural

### 2NC\-\--AT: Securitization Limited

#### Lack of balances and checks for international organizations during securitized emergencies allows endless securitization

In the tradition of Harold Lasswell (1941), [many social scientists and
legal scholars have pondered over the so-called ratchet effect of
emergency powers in national polities]{.underline}. Aaron Friedberg
(2002:240) summarizes the position of these scholars: **['Once
undertaken ... emergency increases in the size of central government
bureaucracies, the bulk of the revenues they extract, and the range of
activities they seek to control are rarely completely
reversed.]{.underline}**' Hence, once seized, [emergency powers tend to
be institutionalized ex post, perpetuating the increased authority of
the executive]{.underline}. Arguably, [emergencies thus involve the
danger that exceptional authority will become the
rule]{.underline}(Gross and Ní Aoláin, 2006: 230). This has a further
implication, namely, [that **enduring exceptionalism also reduces the
obstacles to, and increases the institutional incentives for, further
securitizations.**]{.underline} As Rasler and Thompson (1989: 123--124)
note[, the emergency empowerment of executive agencies also widens the
opportunity to invoke security-related justifications for future
bureaucratic expansions]{.underline}. The 'autocratic tendencies'
inherent in the institutionalization of exceptional powers have been
intensely studied at the national level (Questiaux, 1982: 31). **[These
trends point to what we refer to as an institutional 'emergency trap',
the dynamic feedback of emergency powers on
securitization]{.underline}**. Just like the classic 'security trap'
theorized by the Copenhagen School (see c.a.s.e. collective,2006: 460),
in which the quest for security can lead to the identification of ever
more insecurities that societies seek to control, so [the institution of
emergency powers does not simply put an end toa security crisis. Rather,
it can increase the pressure on executives to become active and respond
in situations where a looming problem may be viewed as an existential
threat]{.underline}. [**At the same time, it reduces institutional
obstacles to further securitizations and creates incentives for
executives to extend their reach and authority**. Emergency provisions
can thereby become a slippery slope toward yet further securitization.
International organizations are especially vulnerable in this regard
because they are not embedded in state-like democratic
institutions]{.underline}. Even though public scrutiny of international
institutions seems to increase with the institutions' political
authority (Zürn et al., 2012), [mechanisms of societal influence and
their capacity to act as an effective corrective on IO politics remain
relatively miniscule]{.underline} (see Gross and Ní Aoláin, 2006: 404).
[As we will discuss in more detail, there are significantly fewer checks
and balances on IO authority than there are in constitutional
democracie]{.underline}s (see Klabbers,2007: 161--162). That the
tendency of exceptionalism to become self-perpetuating also applies to
IOs has become evident in WHO's response to the H1N1 outbreak.

[The amplified **focus on bioterrorism after 9/11 shaped the US public
health field's views of disease spread and approach to disease
control**.]{.underline} The [**US national security** apparatus not only
**projected the specter of enemy states and terrorists attacking the US
with germ weapons**, but **also the notion that any disease outbreak
might be an act of bioterrorism**.]{.underline} For example, [when the
new pathogen SARS was first identified Critical Public
Health]{.underline} 277 in 2002, [**national security specialists
speculated about SARS as a tool of bioterrorism: 'You can't rule out
that this is a weapon'** (McCombs, 2003) and 'It's a very unusual
outbreak ... it's hard to say whether it's deliberate or natural'
(Broad, 2003).]{.underline} In this context, **[newly emerging
infectious diseases triggered more than just a germ panic, but also
apprehensions about bioterrorism]{.underline}**. Health authorities also
began to regard disease outbreaks in a newly alarming light. The
Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine), a
prominent non-governmental organization that advises the government on
issues of science, medicine, and health, exemplified a shift in framing
disease outbreaks under the new security-oriented rubric of 'biological
threats': **[Both naturally occurring and intentionally introduced
biological threats hold increasing potential to cause disease,
disability, and death]{.underline}**. And beyond disease itself, [the
ability of infectious agents to destabilize populations, economies, and
governments is fast becoming a sad fact of life]{.underline}. **[The
prevention and control of infectious diseases are fundamental to
individual, national, and global health and security]{.underline}**
\[emphasis mine\]. (IOM, 2003) While disease had previously been
conceptualized as a national security threat (e.g. [in 2000, the Clinton
Administration formally designated AIDS a threat to national security),
this new articulation framed disease in the same terms as
terrorism]{.underline}. [Disease and bioterrorism became two varieties
of biological threats: one 'naturally occurring', the other
'intentionally introduced.]{.underline}' This reconceptualization even
impacted the way health practitioners and journalists referred to a
disease as old as influenza -- as an example of 'nature's natural
warfare' and 'Mother Nature's WMD \[weapon of mass destruction\]' (see
e.g. IOM, 2003; Ryan & Glarum, 2009). [Recasting disease in this way
gave bioterrorism a weight it had not previously had in US public health
conceptions of disease]{.underline}.

US public health disease control management paradigms changed apace with
these terror-inflected visions of disease. [**Health institutions
increased the scale and scope of automated surveillance**, expanding the
CDC's national public health surveillance apparatus to monitor local and
state health institutions' electronic health databases such as ER triage
logs, 911 emergency calls, and pharmaceutical sales]{.underline}. The
rationale of this enhanced surveillance was to better enable the CDC to
detect and intervene on an outbreak in its early stages. **[Health
workers were also directly enlisted into bioterrorism surveillance
through patient care]{.underline}**. [In late 2001, **Congress approved
funds for hospital staff training, encouraging them to become more
attuned to potential bioterrorism attacks**]{.underline}. [**Training
focused on teaching staff how to recognize and treat patients exposed to
at least one of seven diseases associated with bioterrorism** (smallpox,
anthrax, plague, botulism, tularemia, viral encephalitis, and
hemorrhagic fevers) or to chemical or radiological attacks]{.underline}
(Niska & Burt, 2006). [**Pressures to engage in bioterrorism
surveillance also came from the US biodefense field** -- for example,
**US Army epidemiologists urged care providers to 'have some familiarity
with those diseases expected when caused by bioterrorism agents' and to
have a 'healthy "index of suspicion**" ... to recognize an event early
enough to make significant modifications to the outcome'.]{.underline}
They suggested that [this would help care workers to recognize when
patient symptoms constitute a bioterror event, and thus be better
equipped to enlist the aid of an infectious disease specialist and, if
necessary, report it to local public health and law enforcement
agencies]{.underline} (see e.g. Dembek, Kortepeter, & Pavlin, 2007, p.
353). To some, **[enhancing automated national surveillance and training
health care workers to regard patients as potential sentinels of a
bioterrorist attack might seem useful for preventing
bioterrorism-related epidemics]{.underline}**. However, [this
bioterrorism preparedness campaign also mobilized a disease-terror
imaginary shot through with discourses of the racial Other]{.underline}.
These racial discourses have implications for racially marginalized
populations that I elaborate on in subsequent sections.

### 2NC\-\--!\-\--Racialization

#### Invoking an imaginary doomsday figure of foreign bio-threats creates a racialized other and justifies mass violence and surveillance in the name of national security

<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09581596.2016.1209299?cookieSet=1>

**[The bioterrorist was prominent among an increasingly alarmist cast of
menacing characters in the post9/11 national imaginary]{.underline}**.
In this emergent 'disease-terror imaginary', [the bioterrorist
symbolized a new figure of diseased Other that threatened the nation's
health]{.underline}, [one that was both continuous with but also
departed from previous constructions]{.underline}. As I have shown in
the previous section, **[racialized imaginaries of disease have
historically impacted public health practice, with dire consequences for
how US public Critical Public Health 279 health treats communities and
people of color.]{.underline}** This section outlines the racial
discourses that comprise the figure of the bioterrorist, aiming, in
doing so, to build the case for public health resistance to the larger
racialized imaginary it represents. **[The figure of the bioterrorist,
like that of the diseased Other, invokes ideas of germ contagion and the
racial Other.]{.underline}** While many historians and ethics scholars
have argued that US concern with bioterrorism reflects an agglomeration
of anxieties that began in the 1990s about globalization, biotechnology,
and disease contagion (Cecire, 2009; King, 2003; Sarasin, 2006), they
have varied on the question of the continuities between enduring ideas
about the diseased Other and the figure of the bioterrorist. For
example, historian Philipp Sarasin situates anxieties about bioterrorism
in relation to First World/global north fears about the consequences of
globalization -- namely 'a nightmare about dangerously open borders,
streaming migrants, and uncontrolled exchange and contact' -- and he
connects the figure of the bioterrorist to earlier figurings of the
infected immigrant bringing disease and disorder to the US (Sarasin,
2006). In contrast, historian of medicine Nicholas B. King posits [a
distinction between the traditionally passive disease carrier and the
bioterrorist in **that the latter is unmarked by race, ethnicity, and
nation**: the archetypal bioterrorist symbolizes something quite
different from the infectious bogeymen of the past]{.underline}. [His
predecessors in the American imaginary were passive carriers, primitive
contaminants of modern society identifiable by race, ethnicity, or
nationality ... Bioterrorists are also more inscrutable than their
historical analogs]{.underline}. [American security agencies' extensive
racial and ethnic profiling since September 11 aside, bioterrorists are
generally assumed to be 'nonstate actors,' difficult to track and
impossible to identify by superficial characteristics
alone]{.underline}. **[Unlike the immigrants of the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries, they have no particular ethnic or national
affiliation]{.underline}**. (King, 2003, p. 438)

I build off the work of Sarasin and depart from King's claim by arguing
that the bioterrorist figure is, in fact, deeply racialized through its
connection to discourses of terrorism -- dominant ways of thinking and
speaking about terrorism that construct and reify the figure of the
Arab-Middle Eastern-Muslim terrorist. While King is by no means unaware
of, as he puts it, the 'stigmatization and social prejudice \[that\]
drive political decisions under the conditions of extreme uncertainty
that would certainly accompany a bioterrorist attack', he limits his
analysis of the bioterrorist to an abstract notion that only in
application becomes racialized. But [the figure of the (bio)terrorist
does not exist in isolation from, or prior to, its racialization**. In
the post-9/11 era, the highly charged label of 'terrorist' is indelibly
intertwined with Arabs and Muslims**]{.underline}. [**This construction
of Arabs and Muslims as terrorists is the culmination of decades of US
racial discourses that have pathologized Arab and Muslim populations**
and regions in the Middle East **as uncivilized, backward, and,
moreover, possessing a savage penchant for mass destruction and a hatred
of a civilized and inherently peaceful West**]{.underline}. The
construction of a barbaric and sexually repressed 'Muslim culture' has
in particular anchored notions of Muslim men as explosively violent
(Bhattacharyya, 2008). These racial (and gendered) discourses have their
origins in the oil wars of the 1970s, in the context of progressively
fraught US geo-relations with countries in the Middle East, and have
persisted since then. [**The post-9/11 national security agend**a (the
invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, in conjunction with punitive actions
against Arab residents within the US) **have further racialized Arabs
and Muslims, and consolidated the notion of an 'Arab-Middle
Eastern-Muslim' enemy, resulting in widespread societal discrimination
and racial hatred**]{.underline} towards those ensnared by this harmful,
not to mention ill-defined, grouping,2 for example in jobs and street
harassment (Naber, 2008; Nayak, 2006[**). Moreover, the discourse of
terrorism** goes beyond targeting an imagined Arab-Middle EasternMuslim
enemy; it **also invites a more generalized targeting of the racial
Other**]{.underline}. As Jasbir Puar notes, building off of Sara Ahmed,
**['feared bodies are contagious']{.underline}** [-- **i.e.** **bodies
of color have long been read as a national security threat**, and thus
they intersect in the national imaginary as part of an undifferentiated
racial Other or alternatively as substitutes for one
another]{.underline} (Puar, 2007, p. 187). [**Terror discourse
constructs the enemy population as porous and indistinct**; thus
**terrorist profiling not only targets Arab and Muslim populations, but
also other communities and people of color that have previously been and
continue to be read as a national security threat**]{.underline} (e.g.
Sikhs whose targeting we can interpret, following Puar, as 280 G.
D'Arcangelis the consequence of their resembling the terrorist in kind
(rather than in look), and thus embodying just another dangerous racial
Other to their attackers). [Into this terror imaginary enters the figure
of the bioterrorist, wielding diseases as weapons, enhanced with the
fruits of biotechnological advancement. **The bioterrorist connotes not
only a terror threat, but also one that appears limitless, as diseases
know no geographic bounds, spreading easily across
borders.**]{.underline} Like the unintentionally infecting disease
carrier[, **the bioterrorist represents a threat that cannot be
contained** -- the bioterrorist may wield disease intentionally, but
once deployed the effect of the spreading germs is no
different.]{.underline} The diseased body is an assemblage in the way
Jasbir Puar (drawing on Deleuze and Guattari) uses it to highlight
bodies that are unstable and permeable (Puar, 2007, p. 193); where the
human body ends and the germ begins cannot be easily delineated. And the
bioterrorist is an even more alarming assemblage -- he looms with both
illness and ill intent, igniting a specter of malicious entities that
overtake the nation, cannot be controlled, and thus threaten largescale
devastation with no known end.

[A perfect illustration of how the bioterrorist embodies the combined
menace of disease and terror can be seen in the emergence of one of its
variants -- the 'suicide infector'**. In a climate of growing emphasis
on both bioterrorism and preemptive forms of biodefense, national
security and public health specialists involved in planning for a
bioterror attack hypothesized a terrorist body weaponized with
disease**.]{.underline} [This fictional figure, known as a 'suicide
infector']{.underline} among other names3 [would, rather than wield an
attack remotely (e.g. using an intermediary tool like letters à la the
anthrax mailings), instead 'intentionally infect themselves and then
attempt to spread infection to others' and, moreover, 'attempt to enter
the country while not symptomatic']{.underline} (May & Silverman, 2003).
**[The suicide infector was the subject of doomsday bioterrorism
scenarios that enumerated the use of any number of potential biological
weapons from anthrax to even deadlier and more contagious diseases such
as smallpox or Ebola]{.underline}**. A RAND Corporation report discussed
a chilling scenario of 'suicide attackers who ride mass transit
spreading the virus' (RAND, 2002). [The discussion of the suicide
infector scenario, which mainly took place in national security and
health domains]{.underline} (see e.g. Galamas, 2011; Massachusetts
Nurses Association, 2013; Williams, 2004), also made its way to popular
domains such as news media (where it received some, if limited,
attention). For example, [a New York Times journalist described the
possibility that 'a smallpox epidemic could begin with a single infected
person -- a "smallpox martyr," in the terminology of bioterrorism
experts -- simply walking through a crowd']{.underline} (Stolberg,
2001). [The fact that such a figure was given serious consideration
punctuates how easily the disease-terror imaginary was taken up and
elaborated to produce a new vision of threat]{.underline}. Drawing from
the already established figure of the suicide bomber**[, the fictional
suicide infector was a more potent variation of the racialized trope of
the uncivilized violent Arab-Middle Eastern-Muslim
terrorist]{.underline}**. In weaponizing his own body (again, invoking
the figure of a uniquely lethal racialized masculinity), [**the suicide
infector exemplifies an embodied, irrational violence** (even more so
than the suicide bomber) **because of his willingness to give his entire
being over to the germ state**. The suicide infector is a
terror-inducing germ receptacle who turns the common metaphor of the
racial Other as like a contagion to the racial Other as literally a
collection of germs -- devoid of reason, cutting a chaotic and careless
path through an unsuspecting, defenseless US national body]{.underline}.
If [**the envisioned suicide infector highlights clearly the way the
bioterrorist blends racialized tropes of disease and terror to
spectacular effect**, it also shows that the bioterrorist figure builds
on a characteristic feature of the disease carrier --
invisibility]{.underline}. For the concern is not only that germs are
invisible to the eye, and therefore that their transmission remains
unseen; [it is also that disease carriers can, when asymptomatic, remain
undetected]{.underline}. While the traditional notion of the disease
carrier connotes this sense of stealth to a degree, [the bioterrorist
figure takes this sense of an unseen threat to a new level; the
bioterrorist is not infected in the first place and thus will never be
detectable. Even in the suicide infector scenario, where his infected
body risks betraying his intention, the danger he represents revolves
centrally around the period he is asymptomatic and thus able to conceal
the disease threat he poses]{.underline}. **[Moreover, this valence of
the bioterrorist as an unseen enemy has dual resonance in the
disease-terror Critical Public Health]{.underline}** 281 imaginary --
**[it links up with the trope of the Arab-Middle Eastern-Muslim 'enemy
within']{.underline}**, a trope which resulted from US state targeting
of Arab and Muslim Americans critical of US interventionist policies in
the Middle East since the 1970s (Naber, 2012). [The racialized figure of
the bioterrorist epitomizes the way that the post-9/11 disease-terror
imaginary entangles older racial discourses of the diseased Other with
newer ones of the terrorist]{.underline}. He signifies teeming hordes of
malevolent, surreptitious racial Others -- **[a haunting presence of the
imagined Arab-Middle Eastern-Muslim enemy as well as, potentially, other
bodies of color deemed dangerous to national security]{.underline}**

Returning to the issues that animated this protracted discussion of the
bioterrorist figure, I explore the potential impacts of the
disease-terror imaginary on public health practice. This section focuses
on the [post-9/11 practices of public health 'securitization' that are
presumably most susceptible to the racial dimensions of the
disease-terror imaginary: the 'index of suspicion' that health workers
have been encouraged to adopt and the automated surveillance of patient
data and symptoms that has connected public health to national security
and law enforcement]{.underline}. I query [how the disease-terror
imaginary might translate into public health practices that stigmatize
and target Arab and Muslim populations, as well as other communities of
color deemed 'suspicious' and dangerous]{.underline} in this imaginary.
The purpose of this section is not to determine whether or to what
extent these racialized impacts are occurring (ideally the subject of
future empirical studies), but rather to meditate on possible impacts in
the hopes that readers from the health field will help prevent them from
coming to fruition.

[**The 'index of suspicion' that the national security apparatus has
prescribed to health workers** **encourages them to view disease
outbreaks as potentially the result of a bioterror
attack**]{.underline}. That being the case, it is important to ask
**[how this greater emphasis on bioterror-induced outbreaks may foster
suspicion]{.underline}** **[of patients]{.underline}**. [Will
practitioners perceive a suicide disease carrier instead of a sick
patient? Moreover, in]{.underline} [the context of a disease-terror
imaginary rife with the specter of the racial Other, **are health care
workers and triage nurses more likely to look askance at patients who
fit the 'suspicious' profile (i.e. Arabs,**]{.underline} [**Muslims, and
other communities and people of color ensnared by the disease-terror
imaginary**)]{.underline}? Even more broadly, **[will health workers
perceive these 'suspicious' populations in the vicinity of a
disease]{.underline}** [**outbreak as perpetrators of the
outbreak**?]{.underline}

[It is worth considering whether and how the exclusionary practices that
the health field has historically applied to diseased Others might be
applied -- if they have not been already -- to populations reflected in
the disease-terror imaginary]{.underline}. While the harsh manner in
which the US state and public health has treated, for example, Haitians
(excluding them from entering the US and denying them proper health care
services) may not necessarily come to pass through the securitization of
public health, [more everyday forms of exclusion can easily
occu]{.underline}r. [**Scholars of stigma and health inequality have
shown how** **stigmatization and targeting of racially marginalized
populations can occur at the level of individual** **practitioners'
everyday practices.**]{.underline} [**Studies of the contemporary era
have documented the racial biases** **that affect health care worker
attitudes, behaviors, and interactions with patients, influencing
their** **interpretation of symptoms and clinical
decisions.**]{.underline} Psychologists and health researchers Burgess,
van Ryn, Dovidio, and Saha (2007) note that although [**'overt
expressions of prejudice and negative racial** **stereotypes have
declined substantially over time ... even consciously egalitarian people
may hold** **negative ethnic and racial stereotypes and attitudes of
which they may not be fully conscious'**]{.underline} (Burgess

et al., 2007, p. 882). [Given this, it is not unreasonable to anticipate
that the racialized tropes of bioterrorist disease carriers will inform
any 'index of suspicion' that health practitioners adopt. **The
automated surveillance that resulted from the post-9/11 focus on
bioterrorism may also disproportionately target individuals and
populations deemed 'suspicious'**]{.underline}. [Scholars have examined
how the expansion of automated surveillance in health settings after
9/11 has impacted patient care.]{.underline} Cultural geographer Bronwyn
Parry demonstrates that **[automated surveillance reduces patients to
disease vectors needing to be controlled rather than cared for, thus
encouraging the depersonalization of patients and a decline in the
quality of health care]{.underline}** (Parry, 2012). Given this, I could
ask how, in the context of a racialized disease-terror imaginary, **[the
reduction of patients to disease vectors might be racialized. What kind
and degree of surveillance will health care practitioners apply to
patients who are viewed vis-à-vis their race as
'suspicious'?]{.underline}** The way that **[the disease-terror
imaginary paints a vast landscape of diseased bodies of color harboring
vicious intent may result in discriminatory practices of surveillance in
public health.]{.underline}**

Perhaps even more significantly[, the increased surveillance of health
databases has enlarged the scale and scope of the information collected
not only by public health authorities, but also by national security and
law enforcement]{.underline}. [**Racialized ideas about 'suspicious'
patients might inform the way that public health practitioners identify
and decide to report patient outbreaks** they suspect to be symptomatic
of a bioterror attack, **but they might also inform what law enforcement
and national security officials decide to do with data from patients
belonging to 'suspicious' populations**]{.underline}. [The post-9/11
surveillance apparatus has proven to be highly racialized, both in its
application and in its conception]{.underline} (e.g. the Special
Registration program of 2002 specifically targeted Arab and Muslim male
foreign nationals). In broadest terms, **[post-9/11 automated
surveillance in public health might facilitate the discriminatory
targeting of Arabs, Muslims, and other communities and people of color
marked as dangerous, sweeping them up into the treacherous clutch of law
enforcement]{.underline}**. I have explored these possible implications
not only to lay out new directions in research, but also for more
practical purposes to suggest areas of caution for public health workers
[-- policy-makers, administrators, care workers, and practitioners who
must negotiate the culture of suspicion that has followed in the wake of
the 'securitization' of public health. National security planners,
focusing on terror-infused notions of disease spread, have triggered a
disease-terror imaginary of germ panic and terror hysteria centered on
the specter of a malicious and exceedingly stealthy diseased
Other]{.underline}. [**Fanning the racialized disease-terror imaginary
in public health** may, as I have probed in this section, **feed into
the larger post9/11 climate of fear-driven, racially discriminatory

A week later, [Chinese leaders held a Politburo meeting on SARS and
pledged to provide \'accurate, timely, and honest reporting\' of the
incidence of the disease]{.underline} (DeLisle 2003: 595). A task force
was set up under the Beijing municipal government to coordinate between
civilian and military authorities[**. Once securitization efforts were
made in China, they went well beyond the speech acts** envisaged by the
Copenhagen School **and involved a combination of official and
unofficial speech acts, as well as personnel changes and mobilization
techniques reminiscent of the Maoist era.**]{.underline}

A political crisis broke out in China, resulting in the firing of the
Minister of Health, the Mayor of Beijing, and more than 100 other
officials complicit in the SARS cover-up. On 23 April, Vice Premier Wu
Yi took charge of the Ministry of Health and headed a new command centre
with budget of 2 billion yuan (US\$242 million). On 26 April, an ASEAN+3
health ministers meeting was convened, followed 3 days later by an ASEAN
summit meeting on SARS. [Chinese leaders also met separately to discuss
the crisis, and later, on 3 June, China hosted its own ASEAN meeting on
SARS]{.underline}. [These meetings helped to improve the region\'s
coordination with the WHO and to develop cooperative efforts in disease
surveillance within ASEAN. The Chinese government, which had faced
criticism over the lag in its response time, took advantage of these
meetings to reassure Asian neighbours about it handling of
SARS]{.underline} (Caballero- Anthony 2005: 486-8).

[Although many communities throughout the world organized to take steps
to protect themselves from SARS, some of the steps taken recalled Maoist
mobilization methods]{.underline}. On 1 May 2003, when Hu Jintao
announced a \'People\'s War against SARS\', the Beijing Times published
a poster \'Declare War on SARS\' (Figure 1), reminiscent of Maoist era
campaign posters calling for the prevention of respiratory diseases
(Hanson 2008). [Neighbourhood committees were instructed to enforce
sanitation standards and activists were sent door-to-door. Maoist era
slogans were used to mobilize the population]{.underline}. Examples
included \'Activate the whole Party, mobilize the entire populace, win
the war of annihilation against SARS\' and \'En **[Many Chinese
academics note that the additional restrictions imposed by the
authorities on the media during SARS were counterproductive, in that
they led to rumours, panic buying and social instability]{.underline}**
(Li 2004: 38; Li 2008: 23; Ma 2008: 562; Lu 2009: 96). [Although some of
the Western literature on securitization contends that authoritarian
governments securitize (and in the process, tighten controls over
information) for the purpose of enhancing regime legitimacy (Vuori 2008:
71), Chinese authors argue that, to the contrary, the greater
transparency in reporting avian influenza and other emergencies in
evidence after SARS improved the credibility of the government
domestically]{.underline} (Li 2008: 24; Lu 2009: 96). **[Securitization
has had many negative consequences, for example, the imposition of
severe legal penalties (such as capital punishment for knowingly
spreading SARS), the construction of isolation wards for SARS (which led
to riots in parts of China) and preventive use in poultry of an anti-
viral medication meant for humans]{.underline}** [(which could increase
resistance to the drug in the event of a new avian influenza
outbreak)]{.underline}. **[Securitizing acts also involve a high
personal cost for local whistleblowers, who have faced harassment by
local police, house arrest and even imprisonment]{.underline}**. The
national spirit unite with one heart to battle SARS\' and "enlarge" the
national spirit unite with one heart to battle SARS\' **[Thousands were
forcibly placed under strict quarantine and animals believed to possible
carriers (cats, chickens, etc.) were slaughtered.]{.underline}** [SARS
victims were called \'national heroes\' and \'martyrs\']{.underline}
(Perry 2007: 15). [Although the Chinese population largely rallied
behind the leadership and complied with the mobilization against SARS**,
there was evidence of opposition and protest.**]{.underline} [On 23
April 2002, just as the Chinese leadership was gearing up its response
to SARS**, some 10000 residents of Chaguagang protested a decision to
turn a local school into a quarantine ward for residents who had
possibly been exposed to the disease, fearing that SARS patients would
be transferred to their community**]{.underline} (Freedman 2005: 17)

[Securitization resulted in reactive mobilizations, with mixed results
for Chinese society]{.underline}. **[Although the epidemics eventually
were halted, there were many adverse social, economic and political
impacts]{.underline}**. For some Chinese scholars, the solution is to
balance state-led efforts with initiatives from social networks, drawing
on traditional Chinese practices of mutual aid.

Discourses of cyber security---of [which 'cyber war' is a distinct
subset---are heavily reliant on the articulation of catastrophic 'cyber
doom' scenarios to mobilise political resources]{.underline} (Cavelty,
2008; Lawson, 2013). Strategic cyber war is also framed in ways
prioritising the catastrophic nature of these scenarios, a[lthough their
nature and character remain poorly understood. In the absence of
historical events or processes definitively identified as strategic
cyber war, cyber war can only be imagined rather than
remembered.]{.underline} Moreover[, rather than portraying cyber war as
a protracted and heterogeneous process analogous to the unfolding of
'real' wars, cyber war is often reduced to a single image or identity, a
textual cipher standing in for a more complex phenomenon. This deductive
rationale identifies cyber war as 'catastrophic' or
'apocalyptic',]{.underline} with its character inferred from this
initial assertion of its nature; [the details of cyber war are described
once this initial identity has been established, not before. Cyber war
is often presented in these terms by a wide range of politicians,
policymakers, defence and intelligence personnel, computer security
professionals and academics. Cyber war discourses are disseminated
through the broadcast and online news media, in popular
culture---including films, television, novels---and other elements of
the new media ecology Viewed as an 'accident', strategic cyber war
appears immanent to our contemporary 'wired' world.]{.underline} All
cyber war discourses stress that the vulnerability of modern societies
increases as their dependency on information technologies intensifies.
This dependence is not only practical, in terms of delivering services
and goods, but psychological and political. The hypothetical 'cascading
failures' catalysed by infrastructural subversion and destruction
(Little, 2002) begin by revealing the materiality and functionality of
['invisible' yet physical information infrastructures (Dodge and
Kitchin, 2004). Secondary failures of contingent sociotechnical networks
like water, energy, transport and emergency response follow, which
continue to cascade through the affective realm of corporeal and
psychological stress, before undermining completely the collective
imaginary that is society. As in the global financial crisis, the
accident/apocalypse is characterised by the 'instant and simultaneous
globalisation of affects and fears' (Virilio et al, 2008).]{.underline}

T**[here is little current evidence that cyber war will reach the level
of global accident. There is no firm indication that a cyber attack of
any kind could cause physical damage on this scale, let alone human
deaths]{.underline}** (Rid, 2013a). This may, of course, change in time.
[One might object that the version of cyber war presented here is
constructed between human adversaries rather than between humankind and
its technologies but this would be to forget the interconnectedness and
interdependence of the sociotechnical infrastructures of
postmodernity]{.underline}. [So unpredictable are their potential
interactions, we cannot know if the effects of cyber war would be
restricted to the target systems alone, or would spread beyond them and
potentially back across an aggressor's borde]{.underline}rs. **[Such
'blowback' diminishes the strategic utility of these operations to
high-tech societies, including most of those with the capacity to launch
an attack in the first plac]{.underline}**e (Feaver, 1998; Rathmell,
2003). There is no guarantee an act of cyber war would not cause a
global accident, which leads once again to imagining cyber war as
potential apocalypse. What, however, are the political implications of
these apocalyptic visions: what political 'work' does the framing of
cyber war as apocalypse perform in the present?

Cyber war is therefore both necessary and in some sense desired.
**[Whether transformative cyber war can be brought about by apocalyptic
discourses alone is unknown but the potentially self- fulfilling aspect
of cyber war discourse is evident. ']{.underline}**Like the monsters in
your imagination', writes former White House cyber security advisor
Howard Schmidt, 'these phantoms can take on a persona of an unrelenting
danger that easily surpasses their true capabilities' (Schmidt, 2006:
174). '[As ominous as the dark side of cyberspace may be, our collective
reactions to it are just as ominous--- and can easily become the darkest
driving force of all' (Deibert, 2012: 261). In contrast to apocalyptic
environmental discourses, however, in which there is quite literally no
long-term future and therefore no hope (Swyngedouw, 2010), cyber war
apocalypses are not characterised by pure negativity: they still offer
redemption through cyber security measures congruent with capitalist
logics and the desire of the national security state. Of course, it is
precisely those who nurture fear of apocalypse that promise salvation
the most and will, ultimately, they hope, be in a position to deliver it
(Swyngedouw, 2013).]{.underline}

This article has not attempted to determine whether or not strategic
'cyber war' will happen, or within what timescale. '**[Is it possible
for one of these events to happen? Sure. Is it likely? Absolutely not'
(Schmidt 2006: 172). If the odds of such an event occurring are so
small, it is arguably more important that resources are focused on less
spectacular cyber security issues---crime, espionage, sabotage---from
which cyber war is an unwelcome distraction (Lawson, 2012, 2013;
Guitton, 2013).]{.underline}** Given that strategic cyber war may be a
theoretical impossibility, the odds that cyber war qua war will take
place vanish to zero. This does not exclude the possibility of
large-scale disruptive and destructive events very similar to phenomena
currently described as cyber war but these scenarios

[There has been remarkable consistency in the construction of [the
information and cyber warfare "problem]{.mark}" over the past two
decades]{.underline}. The following section examines these regularities
in the cyber security discourse. As analysts we do not regard these
regular assertions, which have achieved the status of near-unquestioned
commonsense as necessarily true. Neither do we deny any value to these
statements. Rather, we wish to call attention to the fact that [they are
frequently taken for granted and assumed to be true rather than being
rigorously established through empirical research]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [there are political consequences to holding and
perpetuating these assumptions]{.underline}. [The five [characteristics
of]{.mark} the [cyber security discourse]{.mark} that we draw attention
to here [are]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [cyberspace]{.mark} is ungovernable,
unknowable, makes us vulnerable, **[is inevitably threatening]{.mark}**,
[and is inhabited by a range of threatening and hostile actors]{.mark}
on which it confers a number of advantages. These characteristics have
been derived from an empirical examination of cyber security texts and
discourse.\]{.underline}
For privacy advocates, surveillance researchers and nonsecurity Internet
analysts in contrast, [the visibility, threats, and strategic advantages
of cyberspace are constructed in near fundamental
opposition.]{.underline} The digital environment is highly visible, with
every action leaving a machine readable, potentially permanent record
that can be shared and distributed. Websites leave cookies on individual
computers and keep records of IP addresses, whereas Internet service
providers are capable of monitoring all traffic and potentially passing
this onto government. Furthermore, [the structure of cyberspace is
thought of as a medium that privileges the powerful]{.underline}, a site
of powerful social sorting and surveillance (Gandy, 2003; O'Hara &
Shadbolt, 2008). The individual, rather than a locus of power (and
threat), is constructed as at risk, lacking fundamental skills and also
little political power to determine the architecture and processes of
cyberspace.

First, [[cyber security discourse supports the militarization of online

international environment, [means that **war** ]{.mark}**essentially
[becomes permanent]{.mark}**, part of [the "ongoing military
gamesmanship of cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} (Haggerty,
2006b, p. 252). [Constructing cyberspace as a source of national
security threat encourages the application of security practices from
other environments that may be inappropriate or actively harmful to
online activity]{.underline}. [The [language of attack and defense and
of "cyber war" risks]{.mark}]{.underline} pushing out the needs of the
civil sector and individual Internet users, [[reducing openness and
**increasing surveillance**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Security discourses
risk shutting down discussion]{.underline} about Internet policy,
[moving it]{.underline} from relatively open areas of government [to the
closed world of national security decision making]{.underline}. This
risks excluding an important range of actors. Furthermore,
[[constructing cyberspace as a site of risk and threat poses the
potential of a self-fulfilling prophecy as **that space is increasingly
militarized**]{.mark} by various parties]{.underline}. Nations do not
operate in a vacuum and there is the possibility (although not the
necessity) of a cyberspace security dilemma.

**Naming [cyber-threats]{.underline} feeds the process of militarizing

cyberspace as a potential vehicle for widespread social disruption
justifies the expansion of the restrictive security apparatus.**

[the]{.underline} increasing [regulation of networked]{.underline}
**[computing]{.underline}** through digital controls and surveillance
[is being **justified**]{.underline} [using a **securitizing
discourse**]{.underline}. I argue that [the dominant frame of
'**cybersecurity'**]{.underline} [has become one based on **national
security**]{.underline}, [due to the]{.underline} potentially
**[debilitating effect]{.underline}** [that a **breakdown**]{.underline}
[of the network would have on society, the **economy**]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[military]{.underline}**, [and

Security Studies, [this is]{.underline} known as [a]{.underline}
'[securitizing move']{.underline}; [an attempt to frame something as
**essential** to **national security**]{.underline}. I seek to examine
the application of this securitizing discourse to networked computing
and its development into an issue of 'cybersecurity' over the past three
U.S. administrations. To do this, I will apply the Copenhagen School's
framework to each administration's official policy on cybersecurity, in
order to assess whether the securitization is successful, and what
impact proposed responses may have on civil liberties.

Securitization: A Framework for Analysis

[A securitization is a **speech act**]{.underline} [which constitutes a
'**referent object'**, in this case the **state**]{.underline}, [as
**threatened**]{.underline} [in its very existence, and]{.underline}
[therefore **necessitates**]{.underline} [urgent]{.underline}
**[action]{.underline}** (Buzan et al, 1998). [The analysis of this
process of "**securitization**]{.underline}" in networked computing
involves a three-part process: [the identification of a discourse of
**national security**]{.underline} [within discussions of networked
computing]{.underline}, [evidence of the **acceptance**]{.underline} [of
this **discourse** by an audience]{.underline}, [and the promotion or
uptake of **restrictive responses**]{.underline} [aimed at **increasing
security**]{.underline}. The first part of the process, the
[mobilization of an existing discourse of national security, relies upon
the understanding that "the very **utterance** of]{.underline}
'**[security']{.underline}** [is more than just **saying**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[describing something]{.underline}** [but the
**performing** of an]{.underline} **[action]{.underline}**," [with the
potential to **create a new reality**]{.underline} (Stritzel, 2007,
362). [This is a prominent feature of framing]{.underline}, which
Edelman explains allows "the [character]{.underline},
**[causes]{.underline}**, [and consequences of any
phenomenon]{.underline} \[to\] [become radically
**different**]{.underline} as [changes are made in what is prominently
**displayed**]{.underline}, [what is repressed and especially in how
**observations**]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
**[classified]{.underline}**" (as cited in Entman, 1993, 54). [Therefore
scholars of **securitization**]{.underline} [are not concerned with the
**validity** of an **asserted threat**]{.underline}; [their
**focus**]{.underline}, [rather, is the action that is **facilitated**
as a **result**]{.underline} [of the acceptance of the validity of a
threat]{.underline}. Buzan explains that

\[[s\]tates]{.underline}, [like people, can be **paranoid**]{.underline}
(constructing threats where none exist) [or **complacent**]{.underline}
(ignoring actual threats). [But since it is the success]{.underline} (or
not) [of]{.underline} the [securitization that determines whether
**action** is]{.underline} **[taken]{.underline}**, [that side of
**threat analysis** deserves **scrutiny**]{.underline} [just as close as
that **given** to the **material side**]{.underline}. (Buzan, 2006,
1102)

\[Abstract\] In 2007, Estonia became one of the first countries to face
severe cyber-attacks, which it represented as being Web War I. This
[discourse of **cyberwar**]{.underline} [has been]{.underline}
[contested by scholars and **professionals**]{.underline}: [in reality
the event was **nothing close to a war**]{.underline} [and therefore
there also did not have to be **military retaliation**]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**. [By]{.underline} studying the
event using Copenhagen School Securitization theory, it seems like [it
constitutes a]{.underline} failed or partially successful
**[securitizing move]{.underline}** i.e. [an attempt at assigning
an]{.underline} [issue the identity of **existential
threat**]{.underline} [in order to **legitimize** **extraordinary
measures**]{.underline}. This thesis, arguing from a post-structuralist
position, [views securitization as a gradual]{.underline}, [long term
process in constituted out of both **discursive**]{.underline} (speech
act) and non-discursive -**[practices]{.underline}** (extraordinary
measures). The central question that the thesis seeks to answer is: [How
has a securitizing discourse on **cyber threats
legitimized**]{.underline} [the **militarization**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[cyberspace]{.underline}** in Estonia [after the
country experienced cyber-attacks]{.underline} in 2007? By making use of
discourse analysis, this thesis argues that [the discourse of
**cyberwar**]{.underline} -- [or the militarization of **cyber
security**]{.underline} -- [was shaped through its
**repetition**]{.underline} over a longer time that make the immaterial/
virtual visible. [The military **securitizing practices**]{.underline}
[reinforced and disseminated]{.underline} the idea of the
**[cyber-threat]{.underline}** [and cyberwar narrative, but
were]{.underline} [also only possible because they were legitimized
through this **securitizing narrative**]{.underline}. [Simultaneously,
these practices imbued the **securitizing narrative**]{.underline} [with
the material and thereby stabilized the **discourse**]{.underline}.
[Instead of treating securitization according to a sequential causality,
it is a **coconstitutive process**]{.underline} in [which the ideational
and material interact and complement each other]{.underline}.

What will the future of warfare look like? This question does not only
belong to science fiction, but has been a topic of both scholarly- and
public enquiry. One of the most abstract new types of warfare is 'cyber
warfare'. Strategic [military thinkers have **speculated**]{.underline}
[how new digital technologies would affect]{.underline}
[warfare]{.underline} and power relations. [In such a
'cyberwar']{.underline}, [physical weapons and borders would be
**replaced**- or]{.underline} complemented [by **digital
weapons**]{.underline} that reach deep into societies and critical
infrastructures. [Yet]{.underline}, empirical [scholars have
**argued**]{.underline} [that there have been **no
examples**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[cyber-attacks]{.underline}**
[with a level of **lethality**]{.underline} [and damage to fit the
classical **definitions** of]{.underline} '**[war']{.underline}**.

[Still, people talk about cyberwar as **something** that]{.underline}
**[already exists]{.underline}**, [something that countries should
**prepare for**]{.underline} [and something that is **invisible**
or]{.underline} even **[secretive]{.underline}** [but nevertheless
**experienced**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[felt]{.underline}**.
The quote at the start of this chapter illustrates a broader trend in
how 'cyberwar' is discussed.3 In this discussion, popular concepts used
are 'information war', i.e. practices like sending fake information and
propaganda, or 'cyber war', referring to practices like hacking or
temporarily disabling digital services.4 Mundane activities, previously
considered a technical issue for computer experts, are talked about in
terms of military practice, national security and conflict. This new
interpretation given to the security of digital technologies is often
studied by looking at the case of Estonia.5

In 2007, the country experienced cyber-attacks that it later branded to
be 'Web War I'. Stating this to be the first digital state-to-state
attack, the Estonian government attributed the attacks to its neighbor,
Russia. This narrative of 'Web War I' was widely taken over by the
international press and fueled academic and policy discussions as well
as a fear of cyber threats. Ever since, cyberwar as a new, realistic
danger increasingly became a policy object on the agenda of
(inter)national cyber security.6 The process by which an issue comes to
be recognized as a threat to the survival of a 'referent object', in
this case the Estonian state, is analyzed using the theoretical
framework of Securitization Theory. Hansen & Nissenbaum (2009) have
applied this theory to the Estonian case to illustrate how there have
been 'securitizing moves' to cyberspace.

7 They concluded that this process of
'**[cybersecuritization']{.underline}** [is a distinct new type of
**dynamic** or discourse,]{.underline} [but has only been partially
'**successful'**]{.underline} in the case of Estonia.8 [International
audiences did not accept the '**war' narrative**]{.underline} fully, and
therefore not all extraordinary measures were implemented.
[Moreover]{.underline}, Hansen and [Nissenbaum predicted that the
**narrative**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[cyberwar]{.underline}**
[would soon **fade** as it would not have]{.underline} enough impact to
become the dominant interpretation. [However, from a
**long-time-perspective**]{.underline}, [conceptions of (inter)national
**security**]{.underline} [have changed in the **international**- and
domestic]{.underline} **[arena]{.underline}**. [A]{.underline}
[2017-survey amongst **Estonians** found]{.underline} that **[cyber
threats]{.underline}** [are still perceived as the **largest**
security]{.underline} **[issue]{.underline}** to the country.9
[Furthermore, cyber security has become a prominent part of
**policies**]{.underline}- [and practices of **national
security**]{.underline}. It therefore feels unsatisfactory to conclude
that 'securitization' has not been successful considering ideas of cyber
security and security have changed over time.

This thesis analyses the Estonian case, using an updated version of
securitization theory. It thereby aims to develop theory and by
implication provide a more holistic image of the case itself. This
thesis seeks to answer the following question: How has a securitizing
discourse on cyber threats legitimized the militarization of cyberspace
in Estonia after the country experienced cyber-attacks in 2007? This
thesis does not reject the approach and conclusions made by Hansen &
Nissenbaum and other scholars, but seeks to advance both its
theoretical- and empirical insights. The success of securitization
should not be placed external to the speech act. Instead of looking at
securitization as a static moment, it is viewed as a processin which a
discourse of existential threat legitimizes changing material practices.
Empirically, this means that it is not only the attacks and its
representation that are the focus, but also the practices of cyber
security that follow. The main argument is that the cyber-attacks,
discursively represented as cyberwar, became a sign that is citable in
future securitizing moves. This legitimized the increasing military
involvement in cyber security, but also influenced conceptions of
national security in the country. Through repetition, in the form of
material practices, the discourse of cyberwar stabilized.10

Using a poststructuralist, discourse analytical method, securitization
theory is amended to be able to include the possibility of gradual
change in meaning attached to cyber security and to military practice.
In this framework, both signifying narratives are considered to be part
of this process as well as the material practices -- i.e. extraordinary
policy measures. In this process, not only the identity (meaning) of
cyber security (threat) is formed, but also the identity of the referent
object (the Estonian state) and the securitizing actors and audiences
(cyber security experts or policy members). It is not only a case of the
securitization of cyberspace, but also a cyberization of national
(military) security.11 The first chapter lays out the framework of
poststructuralist securitization theory, referred to as 'performative
securitization'. It will argue that the original theory is too static,
as it is focused on a single moment and on external and fixed criteria
for success. The new framework views securitization as a gradual and
intersubjective process, as an accumulation of texts (including
practices) that identify something as an existential threat.12 This
thesis thereby seeks to highlight the discursive struggle by which
military cyber security practices are legitimized. Secondly, the thesis
will provide a brief outline of the methodology used and a chapter
providing background information on Estonia and the attacks. Thirdly,
the analytical chapters will show how broader discourses on cyber
security and Estonian identity have been shaped prior to 2007, which
serves as a structuring device for the analysis of securitizing moves
made after the attacks. Understanding securitization as both a process
of exceptionality and of quick change, the first analytical chapter
focuses on the attacks as a triggering event. The last chapter looks at
the gradual change to practices of security in the country. Finally,
this thesis will argue cyber security and cyberwar have become
stabilized as a security policy objective.13 The attacks as a security
imaginary have shaped identities of the security field, Estonia as a

Chapter 2: Securitization theory, post-Copenhagen School

This thesis makes use of Securitization Theory, developed by the
Copenhagen School (CoS) of security studies. This theory revolutionized
thinking in security studies, by both deepening and widening the concept
of security. Barry Buzan (1991) proposed to study how the meaning of
security was constructed,14 whereas Waever (1993) widened the study of
security to sectors outside the field of military security.15
Securitization theory provides a framework for studying how the logic of
security is applied to 'new' issues, and how this legitimizes certain
'extraordinary measures'. This chapter sets out the basic framework of
securitization theory and its main critiques. These critiques form the
basis of the argument for the framework of 'performative
securitization', which structures this thesis. It will argue that the
'speech act' should be replaced with post-structuralist 'discourse'.

The classic securitization theory framework

[Securitization]{.underline} theory focuses on the process by which an
issue becomes socially constructed and recognized as a security threat.
16 Securitization, in its classical version, [is a '**speech
act'**]{.underline}: [by labeling something as a **security
issue**]{.underline} [it **becomes one**]{.underline}.17 [The developers
of this theory]{.underline}, Buzan, de Wilde and Waever (1998) [based it
upon John L. Austin's speech act theory]{.underline}, in [which
**language is viewed**]{.underline} [as]{.underline}
**[performative]{.underline}**. Each speech act can convey three types
of acts: saying something meaningful (locutionary act), doing in saying
something (illocutionary act) and the effects produced through acting in
saying something (perlocutionary effect).18 [The performativity of
language]{.underline}, following Austin, [is]{.underline} also
[dependent upon appropriate circumstances]{.underline}. 19 These
contextual requirements for success of the speech act, or felicity
conditions, include a 'specific linguistic framing and a particular
intersubjective context'.20 These ideas have been adopted by the
Copenhagen School.

[Securitization **theory**]{.underline} [poses that a **securitizing
actor**]{.underline} [makes a **securitizing move**,]{.underline} [in
which someone frames an issue as an **existential threat**]{.underline}
[to the survival of a **referent object**]{.underline}. This then has to
be accepted as such by a relevant audience. If successful, this logic of
security takes an issue out of the political arena and legitimizes
extraordinary measures.[21A referent object can be the **state**, as in
national security, but also **individuals**]{.underline}, **[critical
infrastructures]{.underline}** [or the environment]{.underline}.
[Securitizing moves must follow internal **felicity
conditions**]{.underline}: rules and conventions of a speech act and its
consequences, or in other words a logic- or grammar of security.22 This
logic of security constructs a story that includes an existential
threat, a sense of urgency and a way out. 23 Similar to the speech act,
external conditions must be met for securitization to happen. The theory
includes external facilitating factors that can constrain or enable
audience acceptance of the move, including the social position of the
actor and - audience and the nature of the threat.24

[militarization]{.underline} of the internet.**

ABSTRACT

[In the face of the rising]{.underline} political [stake associated with
the **Internet**]{.underline}, [states are increasingly **vying** for a
**bigger role**]{.underline} [in its]{.underline}
[governance]{.underline}. [Within a climate of an **array**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[threats]{.underline}** [associated with the
**online** information **space**]{.underline}, [the attention is turning
towards the **governance**]{.underline} [of the internet]{.underline}
**[infrastructure itself]{.underline}**, [comprising both the
physical]{.underline} (the collection of cables computers, servers and
routers that make up the network[) and the virtual]{.underline}
infrastructure ([protocols]{.underline}, social media platforms and
search engines that make it possible to navigate and use the internet).
[The question of **sovereignty**]{.underline} [is not only increasingly
**reflected**]{.underline} [in the legislation of political actors
like]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**, [but also recently in EU
discourse in relation to technological **resilience** and]{.underline}
**[cyber security]{.underline}**. This article aims to map out the
impact of the securitisation of the internet infrastructure in the
Russian and the EU approach to internet governance.

Introduction

Within the context of rising challenges emanating from the online
information space, [states are]{.underline} increasingly [faced
with]{.underline} [the dilemma of how to provide an adequate response to
**threats**]{.underline} [posed in an area that is inherently
**decentralised**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[non-hierarchical]{.underline}** in its architecture. [Due to a
growing **awareness**]{.underline} of the use of information operations
on the internet by state actors in the wake of the 2007--2008
cyberattacks on Estonia and Georgia, the Snowden revelations in 2013 and
the use of hybrid actions and disinformation by Russia during and after
the height of the Ukraine crisis, [there is a **shift**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [the debate on how to **manage**]{.underline} [and
**regulate** the **internet**]{.underline}. [This shift is expressed in
an increased focus on the **role**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[responsibility of **state actors**]{.underline} in achieving a secure
and resilient internet. As Milton Mueller (2017, 417) asserts, the dawn
of these new challenges to state actors has led to cybersecurity claims
being 'used to enmesh various aspects of the Internet in foreign policy
and military conflicts, as well as in other national forms of regulation
and control in which states are privileged'.

Furthermore, security claims seem to form a fertile basis for arguments
of state-actors aimed at (re)asserting their role in the area of
internet governance. [The **characterisation** of cyberspace as a domain
for **military action**]{.underline} [in 2016 by **NATO**]{.underline},
[for example, has led to **increasing efforts** from]{.underline} [both
**Western states** and **Russia**]{.underline} [to provide an
international]{.underline} [normative **framework**]{.underline} to
protect against operations by state actors in cyberspace. In some ways,
[this explicit characterisation of cyberspace as a space for **military
contention**]{.underline}, [affirmed the assertion by Russia itself that
the information space is being used to achieve **political-military
goals**]{.underline}, [a point which was made in the 2000 Doctrine for
Information Security]{.underline}:

\[One of the sources of threats for the information security of the
Russian Federation is\] the development by a range of states of the
concept of information warfare, which foresees the creation of means to
exert a dangerous influence on the information sphere of other countries
of the world, the disruption of the normal functioning of the
information and telecommunication systems, the preservation of
information resources and the acquisition of unauthorized access to
them.

As Maria Ristolainen (2017, 114) posits, [this tendency towards the
**militarisation**]{.underline} [of the internet is
**uncovering**]{.underline} [new ways to approach the challenges posed
by the **instrumentalisation**]{.underline} of [the internet by state
actors as 'both Western and Russian cyberspace and/or information space
is becoming a **new space**]{.underline} [within which states may
**act**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[reassert]{.underline}**
**[traditional notions of sovereignty]{.underline}** -- [yet through
contradictory "**open**]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} "**[closed"
approaches']{.underline}**.

The appearance of these two different approaches can also be viewed
within the development of cyber norms through the UN and the working
groups for Information Security, the UN GGE and the UN OEWG. Since the
development of cyber norms is marked by these two diverging approaches
to sovereignty, the way they are presented by their proponents can be
decisive. Because of this an effective strategy is necessary. [These
strategies can be viewed from the perspective of the process of
"**strategic norm construction**", through which political actors as
strategists **manipulated**]{.underline} [shared normative frames for
their **political ends**]{.underline}" (Kurowska 2019, 1). [An example
of this is visible in the efforts by Russia to advance its normative
**framework** on]{.underline} [information security through the
UN]{.underline}, [as it routinely contests **Western
dominance**]{.underline} in the creation of this normative framework and
accentuates the need to respect the sovereign equality of states (Idem,
10).

demonize opponents and generate support for militarization,

Abstract: [Following]{.underline} the Russian [meddling in
the]{.underline} 2016 US [elections]{.underline},
[disinformation]{.underline} and fake news [became popular terms to help
**generate** domestic]{.underline} **[awareness]{.underline}** [against
**foreign** information]{.underline} **[operations]{.underline}**
globally. Today, [a large number of politicians]{.underline}, diplomats
and civil society leaders [identify disinformation]{.underline} [and
fake news as a primary]{.underline} **[problem]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} both domestic and **[foreign policy]{.underline}**
contexts. But [how do security institutions define]{.underline}
disinformation and fake news in foreign and security policy, and how do
their securitization strategies change over years? This article explores
238,452 tweets from official NATO and affiliated accounts, and more than
2,000 NATO texts, news, statements, and publications using computational
methods since January 2014 and presents an unsupervised structural topic
model (stm) analysis to explore the main thematic and discursive
contexts of these texts. The study finds that **[NATO's
threat]{.underline}** [discourse]{.underline} and [securitization
strategies are heavily influenced by]{.underline} **[US political
lexicon]{.underline}** and discovers that word choices change based on
their likelihood of mobilizing alliance resources and cohesion. In
addition, the study finds that [**NATO's** recent **disinformation
agenda**]{.underline} [is in fact a **continuity** of
**NATO's**]{.underline} long-standing [**Russia**-focused
**securitization**]{.underline} [discourse and an attempt to mobilize
alliance]{.underline} **[attention]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}
[Baltic states and Poland to **counter Russia**]{.underline}.

1 Introduction

Over the last few years, [disinformation, information
warfare]{.underline} and **[fake news]{.underline}** [have become
important strategic]{.underline} and [political concepts in
international]{.underline} [relations]{.underline}(Cour la, 2020;
Lanoszka, 2019). Although these terms aren't new and are as old as the
term 'propaganda', their mainstream use within the context of digital
communication skyrocketed after the 2016 US elections (Grinberg et al.,
2019). However even before that, these terms had begun to enter into the
foreign policy discourse of NATO countries following the 2014 Russian
military operations in Ukraine. Prior to the annexation of Crimea,
Russia had already designated information warfare as part of its 2010
Military Doctrine, which was updated again 2014 with a special emphasis
on digital communication (Renz, 2014). A year prior, the importance of
the digital space for military doctrinal considerations was outlined by
General Valery Gerasimov - Russian Chief of the General Staff. In his
2013 article titled 'The Value of Science is in the Foresight',
Gerasimov wrote: "The very 'rules of war' have changed. The role of
nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown,
and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in
their effectiveness. ... All this is supplemented by military means of a
concealed character." (Galeotti, 2019) These three texts are generally
accepted as the doctrinal basis of modern Russian information operations
that were demonstrated both in Ukraine in 2014, and later in Syria,
after mid-2015 (Sinovets, Renz, 2015).

Since then, strategic [communicative actions that are intended to
**influence**]{.underline}, [mislead and **confuse**
foreign]{.underline} **[populations]{.underline}** [have assumed a
central position in global **debates** about politics and **foreign
policy**]{.underline}. [Given the impact of such actions on
elections]{.underline}, [polarization and crisis
management]{.underline}, [it was natural for the rhetoric about these
actions to assume such a **central position**]{.underline}(Bradshaw,
Howard, 2018). However, over time, [popular buzzwords like]{.underline}
'**[disinformation]{.underline}**/misinformation', '**[fake
news']{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} '**[information
operations']{.underline}** [have proliferated in global political
mainstream]{.underline} discourse and assumed an accusatory nature
worldwide as more leaders, diplomats, and politicians have begun using
them to discredit and delegitimize their political opponents. This
dynamic was later conceptualized as 'discursive deflection' (Ross,
Rivers, 2018; Smith, 2019) and became acutely visible in the foreign
policy domain, as more countries have begun securitizing the concepts
'fake news', 'disinformation', and 'information warfare' to similarly
discredit, and delegitimize rival countries(Baum, Potter, 2019). Broadly
speaking, 'discursive-deflection' is the strategy of discrediting
competitors and rivals by portraying oneself as the sole source of
truth. While the domestic political use of these terms is well-studied,
we are still somewhat in the dark with regard to why countries choose to
securitize these terms and what happens in their interactions with other
countries when they do so.

The foreign policy use of such terms predates the 2016 US elections and
proliferated after the Russian military involvement in Crimea and Donbas
(Khaldarova, Pantti, 2016). The primary reason for this contextual
proliferation was the Russian decision to deny the initial stages of its
involvement in Ukraine and its broader strategy of distracting and
dividing Western attention over Russian military operations (Mejias,
Vokuev, 2017). There is still a debate over whether it was really
Russian information operations that had derailed NATO response in
Ukraine, or if disinformation discourses are employed in order to shift
the blame over to Russia at a time when NATO was already divided over
its commitment to Ukraine (Lysenko, Brooks, 2018). While there is robust
evidence of Russian information operations in Ukraine and its role in
spreading disinformation in NATO countries, sustained NATO apathy
towards rising Russian military influence in the Black Sea after 2014
and Syria after 2015 support the latter claim.

[Critics of Western disinformation]{.underline}
**[discourses]{.underline}** [for example, argue **that such
discourses** have]{.underline} [turned into '**floating**
(]{.underline}or **[empty) signifiers']{.underline}**, [that have **no**
specific]{.underline} [or **agreed-upon meaning** (Farkas, Schou, 2018).
In that vein, **blaming others** for engaging in **disinformation**
often **distracts attention** away from a **mistake** or **failed
policy** enacted by]{.underline} **[the blamer]{.underline}** (Monsees,
2020). In this case, critics argue that [Western discourses on
**disinformation**]{.underline} [are intended to distract attention away
from **NATO** or EU **divisions**]{.underline}, or [more domesticlevel
**polarization dynamics**]{.underline}, [by creating a unique **empty
signifier**]{.underline} (disinformation) [that is employed as a
**rallying rhetoric** that **bolsters**]{.underline} [the significance
of **external threats**]{.underline} (Mas-Manchón et al., 2021). [This
way, disinformation and its associated terms like
**misinformation**]{.underline}, [fake news and information war get
securitized, receiving disproportionate]{.underline} levels of
**[attention]{.underline}** [in the **policy domain**]{.underline}. In
[this context, disinformation and its associated terms are used to
**exaggerate** an **existing threat**]{.underline} [and create a
**rallying** discourse that **would channel** the attention of the
divided Western nations away from their **internal
disagreements**]{.underline}, and towards an inflated external threat.
Some scholars go even further, arguing that disinformation is being
securitized in the West (especially in NATO) to the extent the 'war on
terror' was securitized through the 2000s (Lanoszka, 2019). In this
line, disinformation is alleged to have become a new strategic glue that
would help Western nations pool in their increasingly diverging
interests and resources into a common cause (Baumann, 2020).

Securitization of disinformation in domestic politics is relatively
well-studied (Freelon, Wells, 2020; Neo, 2021). Although these terms
have entered into mainstream debate after the 2016 US elections, former
President Donald Trump too, had securitized fake news to delegitimize
his opponents by constructing rival disinformation as a national
security problem, indirectly attributable to China (Polletta, Callahan,
2019). Following the tornado of accusations in the US, political actors
in Britain, France, Italy, South Africa, Kenya and others have begun
blaming each other for engaging in organized disinformation (Maweu,
2019; Saurwein, Spencer-Smith, 2020). Even in Sweden, there is empirical
evidence that suggests accusing journalists of spreading fake news
results in self-censorship of such outlets (Bennett, Livingston, 2018).
There are further cases of evidence supporting the claim that
elite-level discourses on disinformation have a direct effect on how the
wider society perceives information and facts in general, creating a
measurable effect on public trust towards such facts and information
(Van Duyn, Collier, 2019). In Singapore for example, delegitimizing
rival parties and news outlets through disinformation discourse is
considered 'acceptable', as part of the state's duty to discipline the
opposition and its political actors (Tan, 2020). Similar trends emerging
in democracies and authoritarian countries alike, such as in Austria,
Australia, Poland, Russia, and South Africa, demonstrate the
universality of instrumentalizing disinformation discourse as a
political delegitimization tactic (Kurowska, Reshetnikov, 2018; Tandoc
et al., 2018).

While a robust scholarship is emerging on the domestic political uses of
disinformation discourse, there has so far been no longitudinal, large-N
study that explored how such constructions emerge in international
politics. Furthermore, there has so far been no exploration of how such
discourses evolve over time and under what contexts in foreign affairs.
We know that disinformation and fake news are important issues in world
politics and that they are frequently used to bring an issue to public
attention, but we are more in the dark over the contextual and temporal
nuances that drive how these concepts are discursively constructed in
foreign policy discourse.

This study aims to provide an early addition to the emerging literature
on foreign policy uses of disinformation discourses by focusing on how
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has used them in its
documents and social media posts. It does so by studying 238,452 tweets
from official NATO and affiliated accounts, and more than 2,000 NATO
texts, news, statements, and publications using computational methods
since January 2014 and presents an unsupervised structural topic model
(stm) analysis to explore the main thematic and discursive contexts of
these texts. Ultimately, we hope to trigger a wider debate on the
securitization of disinformation and fake news in foreign policy, and
the greater explanatory value of computational methods in studying
large-N text data in studying such securitization strategies.

2 Securitizing Disinformation

Over the last few years, defining what misleading content is and how to
measure the legitimacy of its dissemination has been at the forefront of
journalistic, political and scientific debate (Tandoc et al., 2018).
Even before its proliferation in 2016, disinformation was a widely-used
term in the mainstream discourse, co-existing with other terms such as
infoglut, or information overload (Andrejevic, 2013). Although at first
disinformation and misinformation were terms used interchangeably,
today, disinformation refers to the deliberate dissemination of false
information with the intention to mislead and confuse its audiences.
Misinformation, on the other hand, strictly defines unintended diffusion
of false information by mistake, without malintent. There are also
bridge terms such as 'malinformation' that is factually accurate but is
deployed to harm and damage an individual or an entity, or the concept
of 'problematic information' as defined by Caroline Jack (Jack, 2017;
Morgan, 2018). Although it is not directly mentioned, all of these
concepts refer to the digital space, where information manipulation is
disseminated faster and wider on social media and digital communication
technologies compared to more media forms of media.

As terms 'disinformation/misinformation', 'fake news', 'information
operation', and 'hybrid war' are often used interchangeably in political
discourse, [there]{.underline} [are no **clear-cut** differences in the
**strategic topic** of]{.underline} each word choice (Guess, Lyons,
2020). [Politicians and leaders can often use these terms as a bag
of]{.underline} **[buzzwords]{.underline}**, [without a **clear**
operational]{.underline} [**definition** of what each of them
precisely]{.underline} **[means]{.underline}**. [Each of these buzzwords
generate roughly the **same effect**]{.underline} [on the **consumers**
of such messages]{.underline}, [which is the **delegitimization of their
target**]{.underline} (Tucker et al., 2018). [Especially problematic is
the fact that once the discourse on disinformation is weaponized to
**delegitimize rivals**]{.underline}, [there is very little such rivals
can do to **defend themselves**]{.underline}. Given the significant
political charge of these terms, individuals or institutions that are
alleged to be engaging in disinformation-related activities often have
to enter into a fruitless spar of words to challenge such allegations,
which usually leads to further controversy. This renders the accuser -
or the side that securitizes disinformation - more advantageous compared
to the accused, generating a dynamic similar to the 'attacker's
advantage' in cyber security where the defender is continuously
blindsided (Tong et al., 2020).

Therefore, the [**securitization** of disinformation]{.underline} -
[that is, discursively constructing disinformation as a **security
concern**]{.underline} [- is becoming almost as
**controversial**]{.underline} [as **disinformation
itself**]{.underline}, [and can often be **deployed** to
**muddle**]{.underline} [the waters of a **healthy
debate**]{.underline}. [Its problem lies within its success; namely how
**successfully**]{.underline} [disinformation gets **securitized** and
rallies **policy resources** around itself. This fits into Buzan et. al.
criteria for a '**successful speech-act'**, which takes places in a
medium most appropriate for its]{.underline} dissemination and have a
clear, [mobilizable **referent object**]{.underline} (i.e. 'those that
spread disinformation') (Buzan et al., 1998). By securitizing
disinformation in the medium that is most conducive for its
dissemination (social media and Internet), speakers get a chance to use
the speed and volume advantage of digital communication technologies
against their opponents. Also, such discursive constructions must be
sedimented (1) rhetorically: have a clear argumentative function, (2)
discursively: contain clear power and hegemonic relations within, (3)
culturally: refer to a well-known case or instance, and (4)
institutionally: in a way that mobilizes policy resources (Williams,
2003).

Yet for the Copenhagen school, not all speech acts constitute
securitization. [Securitization is a very particular]{.underline}
**[discursive construct]{.underline}** [that designates a specific
existential threat that requires the mobilization of **uncommon
resources** and measures that go **beyond** the **norms**]{.underline}
[of institutional and political **responses**]{.underline} (Knudsen,
2001). In many cases, [securitization happens to **trigger** and
facilitate]{.underline} [these **institutional changes**]{.underline}
[by 'shocking' power **brokers** and **bureaucracies**]{.underline} into
action either through internal bureaucratic peer pressure, or through
public opinion pressure (audience costs). As such, [disinformation has
been lifted '**above politics'** in Western **rhetoric** as
a]{.underline} **[peculiar threat]{.underline}** [that requires a
sidelining of **daily** political **squabbles**]{.underline},
[mobilizing unique **resources** and addressing]{.underline} it in
[unity that would otherwise **cannot materialize**]{.underline} (Buzan,
Wæver, 2009). [Ultimately the discursive constructions of disinformation
do constitute acute cases of **securitization**]{.underline} [as they
generate **amity-enmity relations**]{.underline} [among countries that
adopt this **discursive strategy**]{.underline}, versus those that do
not (Buzan, Wæver, 2009).

#### Offensive information operations, specifically in cyberspace, are incredibly problematic because of how they convey information in attempts to "protect" the public

By Hedvig **Ördén**, **2020** ("Securing Judgement: Rethinking Security
and Online Information Threats", Stockholm: Department of Political
Science, Stockholm University, accessed 6/24/2022,

Most research on the online information threat has been conducted within
Defence and Intelligence Studies, employing [[the concept of
'information warfare']{.mark} or more specific military-operational
terms, such as 'information operations' 2 or 'psychological
operations,3' [to describe the online information
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. These studies are based on an understanding
of information as a strategic weapon employed in state-to-state
relations. As Daniel Ventre (2016) writes, [a successful information
operation is intended to 'destroy, deteriorate, disrupt, deceive,
exploit and influence enemy functions' by targeting 'leaders' and other
'human decision makers']{.underline} (Ventre 2016, 44). The aim is to
impair 'the enemy's information and its functions while seeking to
protect those on which one's own military effort depends' (Nincic 2003,
141). While cyberspace is considered a complicating factor in
security-making, the envisaged path to security is still pursued within
the traditional state-centric framework. Security is in the hands of a
'cyber-defence' (Heckman et al. 2015). In more extreme versions, the aim
is 'cybersovereignty,' the establishment of Westphalian
virtual-territorial boundaries in cyberspace (Demchak and Dombrowski
2014), or even the launching of a government-operated 'alternative
internet' (Pherson and Mort Ranta 2019). On a strictly operational
level, however, [[threat-descriptions and security-making practices
focus on individual human vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Most
notably, securitizing actors themselves as well as scholarship on
security draw heavily on the 'mind sciences' of cognitive psychology,
social psychology and evolutionary perspectives in psychology (Palmertz
n.d. 3-4). Outlining the 'theoretical foundations of information
operations', Björn Palmertz, for instance, argues that we need to
understand the 'mental processes and social circumstances that govern
how we form attitudes, make decisions and implement them' (Palmertz n.d.
3-4 and 34) when developing a defence against enemy operations. [Such
[insights]{.mark} into the cognitive aspects of decision-making
[can]{.mark} also [provide pointers for]{.mark} the conduct of powerful
[offensive information operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the light of
this envisaged efficiency of perception-management, however, critics
point to the potential dangers of countering enemy operations online.
Miroslav Nincic, for instance, emphasizes that offensive information
operations conducted in cyberspace -- a sphere without state territorial
boundaries -- might blur the line between domestic and interstate
practices for perception management (Nincic 2003, 147 and 141). In other
words, [when [messages]{.mark} are [directed]{.mark} [at (foreign)
enemies in]{.mark} [cyberspace]{.mark}, they [may still 'convey the
distortions to a domestic audience']{.mark}]{.underline} (Nincic 2003,
141). [[Such distortions]{.mark}, furthermore, [can undermine]{.mark}
'[the]{.mark} [public's ability]{.mark} [to form]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n
autonomous [judgement of government actions]{.mark} [and]{.mark} to
[hold it accountable]{.mark} for these actions']{.underline} (Nincic
2003, 141). [[Countering online information threats through offensive
information operations]{.mark} [could]{.mark} essentially [lead to
problems with transparency and accountability]{.mark} -- key principles
in any democratic context]{.underline}.\
In contrast to this clear-cut national security perspective, many
contemporary scholars within Strategic Studies conceptualize the online
information threat in relation to the problems caused by increased
digitalization. [Describing the threat as a key part of 'hybrid
warfare']{.underline} -- 'the synchronized subversive use of multiple
instruments of power tailored to specific vulnerabilities (including
cyber vulnerabilities)' (Omand 2018, 13) -- this literature opens up for
new non-state enemy actors and a broader object of protection.4
Regarding the civil population as vulnerable to Islamist fundamentalist
'radicalization' (Jasper and Moreland 2014) or as 'psychologically'
unprepared for Russian 'info-war' (Aro 2016, 127), [security goes from
being the protection of the territorial state to the protection of the
citizens within the state.]{.underline} In turn, protecting the
democratic public requires a 'comprehensive' form of security (Aaronson
et al. 2011 and Omand 2018). A widely embraced method is 'strategic
communication5 (Taylor 2002) -- [[communication]{.mark} with 'clear
objectives' [used to]{.mark} inform, [**influence** and persuade]{.mark}
the target audience]{.underline} (Paul 2011, 5). [The idea of
[protecting the democratic public]{.mark} from outside threats spread
through online communication, however, [builds on a set of problematic
assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Arguing that the proposed
countermeasures rest on a 'fundamentally flawed' understanding of the
premises for communication, Cristina Archetti highlights the neglected
'network' dimension of meaning creation (Archetti 2018, 83). In short,
the depiction of strategic communication as having 'clear objectives,'
or the assumption that communication can be a 'powerful weapon' used by
enemies, leaves out the fundamentally intersubjective nature of
communication. Communicative 'truth' cannot simply be inserted top-down,
but is the outcome of a collective process of interpretation (Archetti
2018, 93). [In a democratic context, such assumptions are even more
problematic, since [the]{.mark} intersubjective [production of political
'truth']{.mark}, arising out of communication, [is]{.mark} also
[a]{.mark} [means of drawing the boundaries for legitimate
authority]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Scenarios in the Framing of CyberThreats", 2013, Journal of Information

[The discussion]{.underline} above [should not suggest]{.underline},
however, [that we should **not take cybersecurity
seriously**]{.underline}. Rather, [it should suggest]{.underline} that
[taking]{.underline} [cybersecurity seriously requires]{.underline}
**[re-evaluating]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[assumptions]{.underline}** [upon which **policy-making
proceeds**]{.underline}. [Making effective policy begins with a
**realistic assessment** of]{.underline} [what is **possible** based on
**empirical research**]{.underline}. [The remainder of this article
identifies **potential negative policy implications**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[cyber-doom scenarios]{.underline}** and offers a set
of principles that can be used to guide the formulation and evaluation
of cybersecurity policy.

Negative Impacts of Flawed Assumptions

[The language used to **frame problems**]{.underline} [opens
up]{.underline} some [avenues for response while **closing** off
**others**]{.underline} (Lawson, 2012). [In cyber-doom
scenarios]{.underline}, [cybersecurity is framed primarily in terms of
"**war**" and, with the use of terms such as
"**cyber-9/11**]{.underline}" [and "**cyber-Katrina**]{.underline}," [in
terms of large-scale "**disaster**]{.underline}." [This]{.underline}
war/disaster [framing can lead to a **militarist**]{.underline},
**[command-and-control mindset]{.underline}** [that is ultimately
**counterproductive**]{.underline}.

[A war framing implies the need for **military solutions**]{.underline}
to cybersecurity challenges, [even though most of what gets **lumped**
under the term]{.underline} "**[cyberwar]{.underline}**" [are really
acts of **crime**]{.underline}, **[espionage]{.underline}**,
[or]{.underline} **[political protest]{.underline}**, [and even though
it is not at all clear that a **military response**]{.underline} [is
either appropriate or **effective**]{.underline} (Lewis, 2010).
Nonetheless, [the establishment of]{.underline} the military's U.S.
Cyber Command ([USCYBERCOM]{.underline}) [has been the most significant
U.S. response]{.underline} yet to perceived cyberthreats.

[Such a response is **fraught with danger**]{.underline}. First,
[the]{.underline} very [existence of USCYBERCOM]{.underline}, [which has
both an offensive and defensive mission, could **undermine** the U.S.
**policy** of **promoting**]{.underline} a [**free** and **open
Internet**]{.underline} [worldwide by encouraging greater Internet
**censorship**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[filtering]{.underline}**, [as]{.underline} [well as more **rapid
militarization** of cyberspace]{.underline} (Dunn Cavelty, 2008, p.
143). For example, [some have already called for USCYBERCOM
to]{.underline} [launch strikes on WikiLeaks]{.underline}, which leaked
hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. documents about the wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan (McCullagh, 2010b; Thiessen, 2010; Whitton, 2010).
[Such a response would only serve to create a "**say-do
gap"**]{.underline} (Mullen, 2009, p. 4)--- [a gap between words and
deeds]{.underline}---[that potential adversaries could use to justify
their **own development**]{.underline} [and use of **offensive cyber
weapons**]{.underline} and efforts to thwart whatever possibility there
is for international cooperation on cybersecurity.

Second, [there is the danger of "**blow back**."]{.underline} In [a
highly interconnected world, there is no guarantee that an **offensive**
cyber**attack**]{.underline} [launched by the United States against
another country would **not result**]{.underline} [in serious
**collateral** damage to noncombatants or even end up causing harm to
the **United States**]{.underline} (Dunn Cavelty, 2008, p. 143). [Such
"**blow back**]{.underline}" [may have occurred in a recent case where
the United States military took down a Jihadist discussion forum,
causing collateral damage to **noncombatant computers**]{.underline} and
Web sites, [as well as undermining an ongoing U.S.
**intelligence-gathering** operation]{.underline} (Nakashima, 2010).

[Third, there is the risk of **conflict escalation**]{.underline} [from
cyber to **physical conflict**]{.underline}. [If the United States
launched a cyberattack against a state or nonstate actor lacking the
capability to respond in kind, that actor might choose to respond with
**physical attacks**]{.underline} (Clarke, 2009). [There have even been
calls for the United States to respond with
**conventional**]{.underline} [military **force**]{.underline} [to
**cyberattacks**]{.underline} [that amounted to little more than
**vandalism**]{.underline} (Crovitz, 2011; Dunn, 2010; Zetter, 2009).
Finally, a 2009 review of U.S. military strategy documents, combined
with statements from officials, further adds to the confusion and
potential for escalation by indicating that nuclear response remains on
the table as a possible U.S. response to cyberattack (Markoff & Shanker,
2009; Owens, Dam, & Lin, 2009).

Next, a **[disaster framing]{.underline}** [portends cybersecurity
planning dominated by the same "**command and control \[C2\]
model**]{.underline}" [rooted in flawed assumptions of inevitable
"**panic**]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} "**[social
collapse]{.underline}**" that [have increasingly dominated official U.S.
disaster planning]{.underline} (Quarantelli, 2008, p. 897). [The result
has been ever more **centralized**]{.underline}, [hierarchical,
**bureaucratic**,]{.underline} [and **militarized** disaster
**responses**]{.underline} (Quarantelli, 2008, pp. 895--896; see also
Alexander, 2006; Lakoff, 2006). The result can be a form of "[government
paternalism]{.underline}" in which [officials panic about
the]{.underline} possibility [of panic and then take actions that
**exacerbate** the **situation by**]{.underline} [not only failing to
provide **victims**]{.underline} [with the help they need, but also
**preventing them** from effectively **helping themselves**]{.underline}
(Dynes, 2006; see also Clarke & Chess, 2009, pp. 999--1001). [This
phenomenon was on display in the official response to **Hurricane
Katrina** (]{.underline}Clarke & Chess, 2009, pp. 1003--1004). [In the
realm of cybersecurity]{.underline}, there are already provisions for
the military's USCYBERCOM to provide assistance to the Department of
Homeland Security in the event of a domestic cyber emergency (Ackerman,
2010). Reminiscent of self-imposed blackouts during WWII, Senator Joseph
Lieberman's proposal for a so-called "Internet kill switch," [which
would give the **President** the authority to cut U**.S. Internet
connections**]{.underline} [to the rest of the world in the event of a
large-scale **cyberattack**]{.underline},3 is the [ultimate expression
of the desire to **regain control**]{.underline} [by developing the
means to **destroy** that which we **fear to lose.**]{.underline}

[The war/disaster framing at the heart of contemporary U.S.
cybersecurity discourse risks focusing policy on the narrowest and least
likely portion of the overall cybersecurity challenge]{.underline}---
i.[e., acts of "**cyberwar**]{.underline}" [leading to
economic]{.underline}, **[social]{.underline}**, or civilizational
**[collapse]{.underline}**---[while potentially **diverting attention**
and **resources**]{.underline} [away from making **preparations** to
prevent or **mitigate** the **effects**]{.underline} [of more
**realistic**]{.underline} but perhaps less dramatic
**[scenarios]{.underline}**. But, there are a number of principles that
can guide the formulation and evaluation of cybersecurity policy that
can help us to avoid these pitfalls.

[Strive for **Clear Problem Definition** First and]{.underline} Foremost

[The first step to formulating and evaluating **prospective
cybersecurity**]{.underline} [policies is to strive for clearer
definitions of the problems to be addressed]{.underline}. James
[Lewis]{.underline} (2010) has [argued]{.underline} that
"[Pronouncements that we are **in a cyber war** or face **cyber
terror**]{.underline} [conflate problems and make effective **response**
more **difficult**]{.underline}" (p. 1[). Instead, he advocates that we
**disaggregate**]{.underline} [the different types of
**cyberthreats**]{.underline}---including cyberspace-enabled economic
espionage, political and military espionage, crime, and cyberwar or
cyberterror---so that each particular threat can be addressed in the
most appropriate and effective manner. There is no one-size-fits-all
solution. Dunn Cavelty (2008) goes even further by urging us to take the
complexity of contemporary cybersecurity problems seriously, not by
reducing all challenges to "cyberwar," but instead by focusing "on a far
broader range of potentially dangerous occurrences involving cyber-means
and targets, including failure due to human error, technical problems,
and market failure apart from malicious attacks" (p. 144).

For effective response, complex problems such as contemporary
cybersecurity challenges require us, first and foremost, to acknowledge
their complexity and to work toward the clearest, most precise
definitions possible, even when absolute clarity and precision are
unattainable. Seek Guidance from Empirical Research The formulation and
evaluation of cybersecurity policy needs to be guided whenever possible
by empirical research and rely less on hypothetical scenarios. While
this may seem obvious, several influential voices in the ongoing
cybersecurity debate have argued that the time for defining the problem
is over and that now is instead the time for action (Carr, 2010; Yoran,
2010).

Partly in response to this kind of resistance to providing clear,
consistent diagnostic frames, a recent JASON report has argued that a
lack of clear problem definition and conceptual language is a chief
impediment to creating a true science of cybersecurity (JASON, 2010). In
the case of early airpower theory, reliance on unchallenged assumptions
and hypothetical scenarios in the face of contradictory empirical
evidence had disastrous results. By relying too heavily on hypothetical,
cyber-doom scenarios, current cybersecurity planning is open to the same
criticism that has been leveled against contemporary disaster planning:
It is "organized to deal with predicted vulnerabilities rather than to
mobilize social capital to deal with actual threats" (Dynes, 2006, p.
5). Additionally, while empirical research of a technical nature is
crucial, the formulation and evaluation of cybersecurity policy requires
knowledge of relevant "nontechnical" matters such as the geopolitical,
economic, legal, and other aspects of cybersecurity (Carr, 2009; Lewis,
2009).

This article has demonstrated the value of research conducted in the
humanities and social sciences for the analysis of cyberthreats.
Finally, experts and policy-makers alike need to be critical and
reflexive about cybersecurity claims, constantly asking if what they are
saying or hearing is based on empirical evidence or merely the
reflection of long-held anxieties about technology and recycled
assumptions about infrastructural and social fragility.

[Promote **Resilience** in **Technological**]{.underline} and Social
**[Systems]{.underline}**

[While we should seek to **prevent cyberattack**]{.underline} [when it
is possible and prudent to do so, we should also **promote
resilience**]{.underline} [in technological and social
**systems**]{.underline}. [While it is **unclear** whether the
possession of an **offensive** cyberwar]{.underline}
**[capability]{.underline}** will [**deter** potential]{.underline}
**[attackers]{.underline}**, [it is clear that more **resilient
technological** and **social systems**]{.underline} [are a **benefit**
in **any case**]{.underline}, can help to mitigate the effects of a
cyberattack should it occur, and can even help to deter cyberattacks by
providing a would-be attacker with fewer valuable and vulnerable targets
(Lewis, 2006; Nye, 2010, pp. 189, 191).

[Promote Repair]{.underline}, **[Maintenance]{.underline}**, [and
**Modernization**]{.underline} [of **Infrastructure**]{.underline}
[Systems]{.underline}

[Promoting **resilience**]{.underline} in critical infrastructures
hinges on supporting ongoing repair, maintenance, and modernization of
those systems. Recent events, such as the 2003 blackout and the 2007
collapse of the I-35 Mississippi River bridge in Minnesota, illustrate
that U.S. infrastructure systems are aging and becoming more fragile and
prone to failures. In each of these cases, it was a lack of repair and
maintenance that was the cause of failure, not intentional attack (Nye,
2010, p. 180; Patterson, 2010a). Some have even argued that increased
attention to infrastructure security has led to a reduction in funding
for basic repair and maintenance activities (Liles, 2008). But repair
and maintenance are the key to resilient systems, not only because they
reduce the fragility of those systems and thus help to prevent failures
in the first place, but also because they promote learning and
adaptation among the human repair crews who will be the first responders
when failures occur (Graham & Thrift, 2007, pp. 5, 14; Nye, 2010, p.
189). Thus, instead of "think\[ing\] of the grid as a fortress to be
protected at every point" (Nye, 2010, p. 197) by a central authority
against total collapse caused by a hypothetical cyberattack, we should
invest in the more mundane, ongoing, and essentially decentralized work
of repair and maintenance that are the true source of resilient
infrastructures (Graham & Thrift, 2007, pp. 9--10). This warning against
a fortress mentality and centralization of authority should apply to
cyberspace itself, and should call into question recent calls to
"re-engineer the Internet" largely under the direction of the National
Security Agency (McConnell, 2010, p. B01).

[Promote Decentralization and **Self-Organization** in **Social
Systems**]{.underline}

[Cybersecurity]{.underline} [policy should promote
**decentralization**]{.underline} [and self-organization in efforts to
**prevent**,]{.underline} [defend against, and respond to
**cyberattacks**]{.underline}. [Disaster researchers have shown that
**victims are** often the true **first responders**]{.underline}, [and
that **centralized**, **hierarchical**]{.underline}, [**bureaucratic
responses** can **hamper** their **ability**]{.underline} [to respond in
the **decentralized**]{.underline}, [self-organized
**manner**]{.underline} that [has often proved to be **more
effective**]{.underline} (Quarantelli, 2008, pp. 895--896). [One way
that officials often stand in the way is by **hoarding
information**]{.underline} (Clarke & Chess, 2009, pp. 1000--1001).
Similarly, over the last 50 years, U.S. military doctrine increasingly
has identified decentralization, self-organization, and
information-sharing as the keys to effectively operating in ever-more
complex conflicts that move at an ever-faster pace and over ever-greater
geographical distances (Cebrowski & Garstka, 1998; LeMay & Smith, 1968).
[Preventing or defending against **cyberattacks** on]{.underline}
critical infrastructure [requires recognizing that **private actors**
own **most cyber**]{.underline} and physical
**[infrastructures]{.underline}**. [Thus, a centralized,
**military**-led]{.underline} **[effort]{.underline}** to [protect the
fortress at every point **will not work**]{.underline}. A combination of
incentives, regulations, and public/private partnerships will be
necessary. The owners and operators of critical infrastructures are on
the front lines and will be the first responders. They must be empowered
to act. Similarly, if the worst should occur, average citizens must be
empowered to act in a decentralized, self-organized way to help
themselves and others. In the case of critical infrastructures such as
the electrical grid, this could include the promotion of alternative
energy generation and distribution methods. In this way, "Instead of
being passive consumers, \[citizens\] can become actors in the energy
network. Instead of waiting for blackouts, they can organize
alternatives and become less vulnerable to either terror or natural
catastrophe" (Nye, 2010, p. 203).

[Promote Strong **Local Communities**]{.underline}, [Economies, and Good
**Local Governance**]{.underline}

[Finally, preparation for responding to any **disaster**]{.underline}
[requires the promotion of **strong local communities**]{.underline},
[economies, and good local governance. Just as more **resilient
technological**]{.underline} [systems can better respond in the event of
**failure**,]{.underline} [so too are strong **social
systems**]{.underline} better [able to respond in the event of disaster
of **any type**.]{.underline} Historians and disaster researchers alike
have documented that the responses of individuals and groups in disaster
situations largely depend on larger structural conditions in existence
before the disaster itself. Communities that have weaker social ties
among members, have corrupt or ineffective local government and law
enforcement, and that suffer from economic hardship prior to a disaster
will find it more difficult, if not impossible, to respond effectively
in a time of crisis (Alexander, 2006; Lakoff, 2006; Nye, 2010, p. 185).

In part, this requires policies and planning by local governments during
normal, predisaster periods that not only promotes the growth of strong
local civil-society organizations such as businesses, churches,
nonprofits, and neighborhood associations, but also plans to involve
those organizations in postdisaster response and recovery efforts. Local
governments should plan in advance to allow these organizations to act
in a decentralized and self-organizing manner to aid in response and
recovery. This could include not only planning for what government
institutions can and will do in a disaster, but also what will be left
to civil-society organizations, as well as which regulations from
normal, nondisaster contexts might be relaxed during an emergency to
allow civil-society organizations to aid in response and recovery.
Finally, predisaster efforts by local government institutions to
encourage the formation of informal network ties among the various
civil-society organizations within the community can facilitate the kind
of horizontal and bottom-up informationsharing that is necessary for
effective disaster response and recovery (Brito & Rothschild, 2009;
Chamlee-Wright & Storr, 2008, 2009; Storr & Haeffele-Balch, 2010).

CONCLUSION

In the last three years, [cybersecurity]{.underline} has
[received]{.underline} perhaps [more attention than at any time during
the last three decades]{.underline}. [In an attempt to call attention to
**cyberthreats**, cybersecurity proponents have deployed **cyber-doom
scenarios**]{.underline} [that frame prospective
cyberthreats]{.underline} in terms of "[war]{.underline}" and
"[disaster]{.underline}" and [offer the possibility of total
economic]{.underline}, social, or even **[civilizational
collapse]{.underline}**. [But this article has pointed to some of the
potentially **negative** policy **consequences**]{.underline} [that can
occur when **cyber-doom scenarios**]{.underline} [as motivational frames
dominate or even replace properly formulated **diagnostic
frames**]{.underline}. In particular, it has argued that **[cyber-doom
scenarios]{.underline}** are [more a reflection of
long-held]{.underline} but **[incorrect]{.underline}**
**[assumptions]{.underline}** [and misplaced fears about the
**fragility** of **modern societies**]{.underline} and infrastructure
systems than they are a realistic portrayal of what is possible as a
result of cyberattack. These assumptions and fears often lead to a
centralized, militarized quest for top-down control that is ultimately
counterproductive to achieving stated policy objectives. Influenced by
cyber-doom scenarios, current U.S. cybersecurity policy, with its
creation of a military Cyber Command and suggestions for an "Internet
kill switch," is tending toward the centralized, militarized,
control-oriented, fortress mentality that research suggests is neither
prudent nor effective. Instead, the effective prevention and mitigation
of cyberattacks requires the promotion of resilience by way of repair,
maintenance, and modernization of technological systems and
decentralization, self-organization, economic strength, and good
governance in social systems. [We do not need to wait for access to
classified information or rely solely on **technical experts** to engage
**critically**]{.underline} [with **cybersecurity
discourse**]{.underline}. By [drawing upon existing research in related
areas such as the history of **technology**, military
**history**]{.underline}, [and **disaster sociology**]{.underline}, [we
can **challenge** the **blurring** of boundaries between **diagnostic**
and **motivational frames that**]{.underline} [results in a potentially
dangerous]{.underline} **[war]{.underline}**/disaster
**[framing]{.underline}**, [and we can instead provide alternative
guiding **principles** for **cybersecurity policy-making**]{.underline}.

**Cyber-securitization has produced decades of [failed
policy]{.underline}.**

[Successful Securitization]{.underline}?

Having reviewed the securitizing discourse in the documents, I would
suggest that [Critical Foundations is a **securitizing
move**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} [perhaps **not** a **successful
securitization**]{.underline}. Using the Copenhagen School's criteria,
[it cannot be seen as **generating** enough]{.underline}
**[immediacy]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[salience]{.underline}**
[to promote more general **audience acceptance**]{.underline}. The
[report repeatedly states that **no evidence**]{.underline}
[was]{.underline} [found of an **impending attack**]{.underline} (PCCIP,
1997, 5), and that \[p\]hysical [means to **exploit**
physical]{.underline} **[vulnerabilities]{.underline}** [probably remain
the most **worrisome threat** to our]{.underline} infrastructures today.
But almost [every group]{.underline} we met\... [emphasized]{.underline}
the [importance of developing]{.underline} [approaches to **protecting**
our **infrastructures**]{.underline} [against cyber threats **before**
they **materialize**]{.underline} and produce major system damage
(PCCIP, 1997, 5).

While a threat is suggested, [the emphasis on being
**prepared**]{.underline} [before threats **materialize**]{.underline}
[has the **unintended effect** of]{.underline}
**[confirming]{.underline}** [that this is not an **immediate
issue**]{.underline}, [but may be at **some point** in the
future]{.underline}. While [the report did prompt]{.underline} President
[Clinton to pass]{.underline} [Presidential Decision Directive
63]{.underline} the following year[, in terms of **actionable
response**]{.underline}, [the author of the document]{.underline},
Richard A. Clarke, [calls it "**toothless**]{.underline}" (Clarke, 2010,
109). Conversely, the NSSC is much more emphatic that these threats are
very much present today. It suggests that the reason we have not yet
experienced a nationally debilitating cyber attack is due to the high
technical sophistication needed to carry out such an attack (DHS, 2003,
viii). It then assures the audience that "\[t\]here have been instances
where organized attackers have exploited vulnerabilities that may be
indicative of more destructive capabilities" (ibid), thereby suggesting
that smaller-scale attacks have occurred, and will only become more
effective with time. The CPR goes even further, outlining specific
cyber-incidents, disruption and damaged caused, and estimated financial
losses (NSHSC, 2009, 2).

[The increase of a sense of **urgency**]{.underline} in the documents,
[the institutionalization of **cybersecurity efforts**]{.underline},
[and the targeting of progressively **wider audiences**]{.underline}
[seems to suggest a **gradual acceptance**]{.underline}, at least within
government, of the securitization of cyberspace. Therefore in
conclusion, I ask what responses are being justified by the acceptance
of the need to increase cybersecurity, and what consideration, if any,
is given to the impact these responses may have on civil liberties?

Responses to Securitization and Areas of Further Research Perhaps
surprisingly, given the level of urgency with which the subject is
addressed, all three documents hold firm to the American belief in
federal non-intervention in the private sector, and eschew the
regulation of industry. They recommend instead a response based on
increased coordination and information sharing with the private sector,
alongside a public awarenessraising campaign, and the government leading
by example. In an effort to ensure that this publicprivate partnership
is "genuine, mutual and cooperative," Critical Foundations recommends
that "the U.S. government should, to the extent feasible, seek to avoid
outcomes that increase government regulation or expand unfunded
government mandates to the private sector" (PCCIP, 1997, 3). Rather, it
is suggested that financial incentives should be used to encourage the
desired behaviour (4). The NSSC further addresses the balance between
the public and private, and the importance of non-intervention, stating
that "\[t\]he federal government should likewise not intrude into homes
and small businesses, into universities, or state and local agencies and
departments to create secure computer networks'' (DHS, 2003, 11). Little
attention is therefore given by the documents to civil liberties because
little is needed, beyond ensuring that the promoted 'information
sharing' respects privacy rights, so that "\[c\]onsumers and
operators\... have confidence that information will be handled
accurately, confidentially and reliably" (PCCIP, 4). The CPR also
suggests the designation of a privacy and civil liberties official to
the National Security Council cybersecurity directorate to address any
privacy concerns (NSHSC, 2009, 37).

**[However]{.underline}** [there is **evidence**]{.underline} [of some
**dissatisfaction**]{.underline} among [security advisors with this
approach]{.underline}. To Richard Clarke, [these efforts at
cybersecurity have been an "**unmitigated failure**]{.underline}"
(Clarke, 2010, 104). [Serving as the]{.underline} National [Coordinator
for Security]{.underline}, [Infrastructure]{.underline}, and
[CounterTerrorism]{.underline} under Clinton and the Special Advisor to
the President for Cybersecurity under George Bush, [he is also the
author of PDD63]{.underline} and headed the team that wrote the NSSC. He
has long been an advocate of more stringent controls over cyberspace,
and in his book, Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and
What to Do About It, [he suggests several much more **intrusive** and
**restrictive methods** of cybersecurity]{.underline}. While military
networks are governed and protected by U.S. Cyber Command, and the DHS
has responsibility for dotgov networks, the safety of public networks is
left to industry, and he does not trust industry to regulate itself, due
to the fact that the information sharing and voluntary measure approach
has been government policy for over a decade, but this has not protected
cyberspace from a series of major incidents which have affected its
proper functioning (Clarke, 2010, 113-112). [He complains
that]{.underline}, [during]{.underline} the **[Bush]{.underline}**
Administration especially, [the White House did not
**taken**]{.underline} **[cybersecurity seriously enough]{.underline}**,
[stating that "\[n\]o regulation and no decision-making authority meant
**little potential** for results]{.underline}" (109).

**[2NC\-\--AT: Cyberthreats Real]{.underline}**

**Be [skeptical]{.underline} of their [impacts]{.underline},
descriptions of cyber-threats are neither [objective]{.underline} nor
[neutral]{.underline}, but are instead informed by social context and
used as a vehicle to [expand state power]{.underline}.**

The second stage in the process concerns the likelihood that this
discourse will be accepted by a wider audience than those advancing the
securitization. [The]{.underline} [ability of an actor to]{.underline}
successfully [securitize an issue is highly dependent on
their]{.underline} position. [Security has]{.underline}, to some degree,
[been institutionalized, as is the case with the **military**, and
therefore "some actors are placed in **positions of power** by virtue of
being generally]{.underline} **[accepted voices of
security]{.underline}**, [by having the power to **define
security**]{.underline}" (Buzan et al, 1998, 31). [Government
cybersecurity policy would therefore seem to be an ideal vehicle to
mobilize and perhaps also **legitimize** a **securitizing
move**]{.underline}. Policy represents an administration's official
standpoint on an issue which is understood to be a problem, and proposes
solutions based on technical knowledge and research. However, as public
policy scholar Frank Fischer explains,

\[f\]rom the social constructivist perspective\... [the social and
political life under investigation is **embedded**]{.underline} [in a
web of **social meanings**]{.underline} [produced and reproduced through
**discursive practices**]{.underline}. [Politics and public policy are
understood to take shape through socially **interpreted
understandings**]{.underline}, and [their meanings and the discourses
that **circulate** them are **not of the actors'** own **choosing or
making**]{.underline}. (2003, 13)

Public policy therefore contains both a persuasive and a responsive
element; it seeks to justify a chosen course of action which is based
upon socially interpreted understandings of 'national security'. To use
the Copenhagen School's terms, it is both part of the securitizing move,
employing a discourse of security, but by its very existence,
demonstrates the success of the securitizing move because the issue has
been taken seriously enough to warrant an official standpoint and
planned response. Assessing how far securitization in policy promotes
national security above all other considerations, including civil
liberties, is the third part of the process.

By applying a framework of security to an event, it is understood that
the issue is one of urgency, and, in the words of Buzan et al, "if the
problem is not handled now it will be too late, and we will not exist to
remedy our failure" (1998, 26). According to the Copenhagen School\'s
approach, ["\[t\]he invocation of security has been the **key** to
**legitimizing**]{.underline} [the **use of force**]{.underline}, [but
more generally it has opened the way for the **state** to
**mobilize**]{.underline}, [or to take special powers, to **handle
existential threats**]{.underline}" (ibid, 21). [If a **securitization**
is **successful**, an audience will tolerate **violations**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[rules]{.underline}** [that would otherwise have to
be **obeyed**]{.underline}, [for example the **restriction** of **free
speech**]{.underline}, or [freedom from unreasonable search and
seizure]{.underline}. By its very definition, a [framework selectively
calls attention to **certain** aspects of **reality**]{.underline}, [and
therefore **ignores** or **omits others**]{.underline} (Entman, 1993,
54). A security framework privileges security above all other concerns,
sometimes to the detriment of civil liberties. It is commonly understood
that to attain security, a little freedom must be given up, but how much
freedom is under debate. It is not yet clear whether the security
arguments of the U.S. military, the intelligence community, and more
hawkish members of government will result in the hypersecuritization of
cyberspace---to use Barry Buzan\'s term for the mobilization of
exaggerated threats and excessive countermeasures (2004, 172)---or
whether a more measured view, taking into account civil liberties and
the positive potential of the Internet, will win out.

existence]{.underline}.**

[This]{.underline} conceptual [shift was also used to explore the **new
problems**]{.underline} [presented during the **Cold War**]{.underline}
[of the avoidance of the deployment of weapons]{.underline}. The use of
nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War
both realized and ended 'total war'; mutually assured destruction or
'MAD' ensured that total war was no longer viable in nuclear-armed
states (Gray, 1997, 168). Hannah Arendt calls this shift "a radical
change in the very nature of war through the introduction of the
deterrent as the guiding principle in the armament race" (Arendt, 1965,
6). This also prompted the dissolution of any kind of real or imagined
separation between the civilian and military domains, and expanded the
concept of security into a more civilian enterprise, a third major focus
of the new security studies field. Civilians would be the majority of
the victims in a nuclear attack, but in another sense, civilian experts,
from physicists to economists to sociologists were needed to expand
military knowledge in this new war-avoiding climate of deterrence (Buzan
& Hanson, 2009, 2). [The role of **civilians**]{.underline} [has grown
even more important to current **military efforts** due to
the]{.underline} [increasing **reliance**]{.underline} [on research and
development as the military struggles to come up with more
**intelligent** and **effective weapons** to accommodate these shifts in
warfare]{.underline}.

[Traditional concepts of **national security**]{.underline}
[were]{.underline} again **[challenged]{.underline}** [by the fall of
the **Soviet Union**]{.underline} and the end of the Cold War. Buzan
argues that \[[w\]hen the Cold War ended]{.underline}, [Washington
seemed to experience a **threat deficit**, and there was a string of
**attempts** to find a **replacement** for the **Soviet Union** as the
**enemy focus** for US foreign]{.underline} and **[military
policy]{.underline}**\... [which for more than 40 years had created a
**common cause** and a shared framing that underpinned US **leadership
of the West**]{.underline} (2006, 1101[). At a time when the US held the
position of the only remaining superpower]{.underline}, with no other
nation possessing the military might to challenge it, [the]{.underline}
traditional [understanding of security as being state]{.underline} and
militarily-oriented [was shaken by the events of September]{.underline}
**[11,]{.underline}** 2001. The devastating attacks, targeting civilians
and carried out not by a rogue or enemy state but by terrorists, created
a new concept of security in which everyone was a potential threat, and
everyone was therefore suspect. [Providing a **solution** to the
**threat-deficit**,]{.underline} [Lyon argues that]{.underline}
"\[a\]nti-[terrorism initiatives pick up where the **Cold War rhetoric**
and]{.underline} **[attitudes left off]{.underline}**, replacing the old
"Communist" bugbears with "terrorist" ones (2003, 7).

[As issues of **national security** have **expanded**]{.underline}
[beyond traditional understandings]{.underline} of the military and
warfare, [and the invocation of the Global War on Terror has created a
climate of constant]{.underline}, [low-level threat]{.underline}, [the
response has been an increase in regulation and
**surveillance**.]{.underline} Agamben explains the effect of this shift
on the way in which nations are governed, documenting the gradual
emancipation of a 'state of exception' from periods of warfare, through
the declaration of this state of emergency in times of economic crisis,
strikes, and social tensions. The result of this expansion of
'exceptional circumstances' has been that "the declaration of the state
of exception has gradually been replaced by an unprecedented
generalization of the paradigm of security as the normal technique of
government" (2005, 14). The state of exception has now become the rule
(Benjamin, 2003 392).

The framework of national security has therefore been expanded to
encompass a wider range of threats, but still invokes pre-existing
schemata. As a result, [**non-military** threats have been framed in
traditional **security**]{.underline} [terms by politicians for the
last]{.underline} [several decades]{.underline}, [for example the
**\'war on drugs'**, as a means of justifying increasing **government
regulation**]{.underline} [and **control**]{.underline} (Buzan, 2006,
1104) [and it is into this framework that **cyber security** has been
**added**]{.underline} (Nissenbaum, 2005; Nissenbaum & Hansen, 2009;
Bendrath, 2003; Bendrath et al, 2007; Saco, 1999). As explained by
Myriam Dunn, when addressing cybersecurity, [states usually focus on the
protection of **critical infrastructure**]{.underline}, [which includes
information systems and telecommunications]{.underline}, energy and
utilities, transport, and finance (2007, 87). [Since being connected to
computer networks]{.underline}, [these facilities have become vulnerable
to **attack**, as they could be hacked into by outsiders and
damaged]{.underline}. At the same time, [the Internet]{.underline}
"[challenges conventional ways of thinking about **space, sovereignty,
and security**]{.underline}" [due to its transgression of national
borders]{.underline} (Saco, 1999, 262), [and such a challenge to state
authority through the "**blurring** of **traditional
boundaries**]{.underline}" has prompted great anxiety from security
advisers (ibid, 263). [The **inability** to]{.underline} **[control the
traffic]{.underline}** [which crosses into U.S.
**cyberspace**]{.underline}, [combined with the integration of
information systems into all areas of life including critical
infrastructure and the **military**]{.underline}, [play into **fears**
about]{.underline} **[asymmetrical threats]{.underline}**. That is to
say, [with very little **risk** or **investment**, a weaker adversary
could exploit U.S. **information dependence**]{.underline} and strike at
this weak point while avoiding the nation's military strength (Dunn,
2007, 93). A concern with this threat is clear throughout cybersecurity
policy, as I will show in the analysis of securitization in three key
documents from the last three administrations.

Scenarios in the Framing of CyberThreats", 2013, Journal of Information

ABSTRACT. [Cybersecurity proponents]{.underline} often [rely
on]{.underline} **[cyber-doom]{.underline}** [scenarios as a key
**tactic** for calling]{.underline} [attention to prospective
**cyberthreats**]{.underline}. This article critically examines
cyber-doom scenarios by placing them in a larger historical context,
assessing how realistic they are, and drawing out the policy
implications of relying on such tales. It draws from relevant research
in the history of technology, military history, and disaster sociology
to examine some of the key assertions and assumptions of cyber-- doom
scenarios. The article argues that [**cyber-doom**
scenarios]{.underline} [are the latest manifestation of fears about
"**technology-out-of-control**]{.underline}" in Western societies, [that
they are **unrealistic**]{.underline}, [and that they encourage the
adoption of **counterproductive**]{.underline}, even dangerous
**[policies]{.underline}**. The article concludes by offering
alternative principles for the formulation of cybersecurity policy.

\[T\]hese war games are about the real effects of a cyberwar \... about
causing chaos in our streets at home due to sudden crashes in our
critical infrastructure through manipulation of our banking,
transportation, utilities, communications, and other critical
infrastructure industries. These are all real scenarios \... .
(Patterson, 2010b) In seeking a prudent policy, the difficulty for
decision-makers is to navigate the rocky shoals between hysterical
doomsday scenarios and uninformed complacency. (Dunn Cavelty, 2008, p.
144)

Recently, news media and [policy-makers]{.underline} in the United
States have [turned their attention to]{.underline} **[prospective
threats]{.underline}** to and through cyberspace. Prospective
cyberthreats include attacks launched via cyberspace on critical
infrastructures such as power, water, transportation, and communication
systems, but also terrorist use of the Internet, mobile phones, and
other information and communication technologies (ICTs) for fundraising,
recruiting, organizing, and carrying out attacks (Deibert & Rohozinski,
2010[). Out of frustration over a perceived lack of attention to these
threats, combined with a belief that "**exaggeration**]{.underline}"
[and]{.underline} "**[appeals to emotions]{.underline}** [like fear can
be more **compelling**]{.underline} [than a rational discussion of
strategy]{.underline}" (Lewis, 2010, p. 4), [some cybersecurity
proponents deploy "**cyber-doom scenarios**]{.underline}" (Dunn Cavelty,
2008, p. 2). These are hypothetical tales of cyberattacks resulting in
the mass collapse of critical infrastructures, which in turn leads to
serious economic losses, or even total economic, social, or
civilizational collapse. These tactics seem to have paid off in recent
years, with cybersecurity finding its way onto the agendas of top
civilian and military policy-makers alike. The results have included the
creation of a White House "cybersecurity czar," the creation of the
military's U.S. Cyber Command, and the consideration of several
cybersecurity-related pieces of legislation by the U.S. Congress.

In the last several years, several high-profile "cyberattack"incidents
have focused news media and policy-maker attention on cybersecurity.
These have included two large-scale cyberattacks attributed to Russia:
one against the nation of Estonia in 2007 (Blank, 2008; Evron, 2008) and
one against the nation of Georgia in 2008 that coincided with a Russian
invasion of that country (Bumgarner & Borg, 2009; "Georgia cyberattacks
spark debate in Washington," 2008; Korns & Kastenberg, 2008; Nichol,
2008). In January 2010, Google's accusations of Chinese cyberattacks
against it garnered a great deal of press attention and were featured
prominently in Secretary of State Clinton's speech on Internet freedom
(Clinton, 2010).1 Most recently, the United States and Israel have been
implicated in the Stuxnet cyberattack against Iranian nuclear facilities
(Sanger, 2012).

These are but the latest developments in an ongoing discussion of
prospective cyberthreats. Over the last three decades, cybersecurity
proponents have presented a shifting and sometimes ambiguous case for
what, exactly, is being threatened and by whom. During the 1980s, the
main cybersecurity concern was foreign espionage via the exploitation of
the United States's increasing dependence on computers and networks.
Then, in the 1990s, experts began writing about the supposed nonstate,
cyberterrorist threat to civilian critical infrastructures. In the
opening days of the Bush administration, cybersecurity proponents
replaced nonstate actors with state actors as the dominant threat. But
in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the threat perception returned to
terrorists using cyberspace to attack critical infrastructure.

Then, in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2003, state actors once more
became the supposed threat, with Saddam Hussein's Iraq making the list
of states with a cyberwar capability (Bendrath, 2001, 2003; Dunn
Cavelty, 2008; Weimann, 2005, pp. 133--134). Recent policy documents
identify a combination of state actors working directly or indirectly
via nonstate proxies---e.g., "patriotic hackers" or organized crime---to
target private intellectual property and government secrets (Langevin,
McCaul, Charney, & Raduege, 2008; The White House, 2009a; White House
Press Office, 2009).

[Despite **persistent ambiguity**]{.underline} in cyberthreat
perceptions, [cybersecurity proponents continue to rely on **cyber-doom
scenarios** as a key **rhetorical tactic**]{.underline} [for motivating
a **response** to **cyberthreats**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
article [critically examines **cyber**-doom **scenarios**]{.underline}
[by placing them in a **larger** historical **context**]{.underline},
[assessing how **realistic** they]{.underline} **[are]{.underline}**,
drawing outthe policyimplications of relying on such tales, and offering
alternative principles for the formulation of cybersecurity policy. It
draws from relevant research in the history of technology, military
history, and disaster sociology to examine some of the key assertions
and assumptions upon which cyber-doom scenarios rely. It argues that
cyber-doom scenarios are the latest manifestation of longstanding fears
about "technology-out-of-control" in Western societies, that tales of
infrastructural collapse leading to social and/or civilizational
collapse are unrealistic, and that the constant drumbeat of cyber-doom
scenarios encourages the adoption of counterproductive policies focused
on control, militarization, and centralization. As an alternative, it is
argued that cybersecurity policy should be based on more realistic
understandings of whatis possible, which areinformed by empirical
research and guided by principles of resilience, decentralization, and
self-organization.

MOTIVATING CYBERSECURITIZATION

This article contributes to critical constructivist scholarship on
cybersecurity discourse (Bendrath, 2001, 2003; Dunn Cavelty, 2007, 2008;
Eriksson, 2002; Hansen & Nissenbaum, 2009). Much of this work draws from
securitization theory, which begins with the observation that [threats
to security are neither **natural** nor **given**]{.underline}, [but
rather must be **constructed** through **political
discourse**]{.underline}. [Securitization theory posits that the process
of **constructing security**]{.underline} [threats]{.underline} (e.g.,
"securitization") [involves a "**securitizing actor"**]{.underline} (a
speaker, usually a political leader or decision maker) [who]{.underline}
identifies "**[threat subjects]{.underline}**" (the source of the
threat) and "[referent objects]{.underline}" (that which is threatened).
[Securitization of an issue is used to justify taking "**exceptional
measures**]{.underline}" [outside the normal political process in
response to the newly **identified threat**]{.underline} (Buzan, Wæver,
& Wilde, 1998).

By combining securitization theory with insights from framing theory,
Myriam Dunn Cavelty (2007, 2008) has provided the most comprehensive
theoretical treatment of cybersecurity to date. The result of "social
contests for legitimate definition of reality," frames "influence the
actions of actors and define meaning in the public mind" (Dunn Cavelty,
2007, p. 23). She maps three types of frames to the process of
securitization. "\[D\]iagnostic framing \... is about clearly defining a
problem and assigning blame for the problem," and therefore corresponds
to the identification of threat subjects and referent objects in
securitization. "\[P\]rognostic framing \... is about offering
solutions" to the problem and corresponds to the "exceptional measures"
justified by a successful securitization. Finally, "motivational
framing" is about "rally\[ing\] the troops behind the cause or a call
for action" (Dunn Cavelty, 2007, p. 23).

Where Dunn Cavelty has focused on diagnostic and prognostic framing,
this article examines the ways that **[motivational
frames]{.underline}** [might]{.underline} "**[influence social
action]{.underline}**," [as well as "how frames can be
changed]{.underline}" (Dunn Cavelty, 2007, p. 23). [While it is safe to
assume that **prognostic frames**]{.underline} [do and should reflect
diagnostic frames to some degree]{.underline} (Dunn Cavelty, 2008, p.
40), [the impact of **motivational frames** such as]{.underline}
**[cyber-doom]{.underline}** [scenarios on the development of **policy
responses** is less clear, especially]{.underline} when the diagnosis of
the problem remains ambiguous at best, as is the case for cyberthreats.
Nonetheless, it is clear that motivational frames will have an impact
upon policy-making. Uncertainty in diagnostic frames combined with the
fact that "there have been no major destructive attacks on the
cyber-level" leads Dunn Cavelty to conclude that "decisions have to be
made based on scenarios and assumptions. \... \[T\]hat \[cyber-threats\]
are hyped is in fact just a side effect of their nature" (Dunn Cavelty,
2008, p. 5). But this article posits some potentially negative policy
consequences that can occur when cyber-doom scenarios as motivational
frames dominate or even replace properly formulated diagnostic frames.

Finally, this article provides insight into strategies that might aid
critical security scholars with changing the framing of, and ultimately
"desecuritizing," cyberthreats. It is not the case that we do not know
enough without access to classified information or advanced technical
degrees to evaluate critically and challenge such scenarios. By drawing
from knowledge produced in various fields of research, we are able to
address particular assertions and assumptions that constitute cyber-doom
scenarios. We have experience with and published research about the
anxiety and fear that comes with the development of new technologies,
the effects of using revolutionary new weapons, and the impacts of
disaster on social, economic, and technological systems. By drawing
strategically and appropriately from these areas, we can challenge the
individual components of cyber-doom scenarios, work to re-frame the
discussion of cyberthreats, and provide alternative guiding principles
for policy-making.

CYBER-DOOM SCENARIOS

[Cyber-doom scenarios are **hypothetical stories**]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} **[prospective impacts]{.underline}** [of a
cyberattack and are meant to serve as **cautionary tales**]{.underline}
that focus attention on cybersecurity. These stories typically follow a
set pattern involving a cyberattack disrupting or destroying critical
infrastructure. Examples include attacks against the electrical grid
leading to mass blackouts, against the financial system leading to
economic losses or complete economic collapse, against the
transportation system leading to planes and trains crashing, against
dams leading floodgates to open, or against nuclear power plants leading
to meltdowns (Dunn Cavelty, 2008, p. 2). Recognizing that modern
infrastructures are closely interlinked and interdependent, such
scenarios often involve a combination of multiple critical
infrastructure systems failing simultaneously---what is sometimes
referred to as a "cascading failure." This was the case in the "Cyber
Shockwave" war game televised by CNN in February 2010, in which a
computer worm spreading among cell phones eventually led to serious
disruptions of critical infrastructures (Gaylord, 2010). Even more
ominously, Richard Clarke and Robert Knake (2010, pp. 64--68) present a
scenario in which a cyberattack variously destroys or seriously disrupts
all U.S. infrastructure in only 15 minutes, killing thousands and
wreaking unprecedented destruction on U.S. cities.

Surprisingly, [some argue that we have **already had
attacks**]{.underline} [at this level, but that we just have **not
recognized** that they were occurring]{.underline}. For example, Amit
Yoran, former head of the Department of Homeland Security's National
Cyber Security Division, claims that a "[cyber9/11]{.underline}" has
[already occurred]{.underline}, "but [it's happened slowly so we don't
see it."]{.underline} As evidence, [he points to the **2007**
cyberattacks on]{.underline} **[Estonia]{.underline}**, [as well as
other incidents in which the computer **systems** of
government]{.underline} **[agencies]{.underline}** or [contractors have
been **infiltrated**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [sensitive
information stolen (]{.underline}Singel, 2009). Similarly, the speaker
of the Estonian parliament, Ene Ergma, has said that "When I look at a
nuclear explosion, and the explosion that happened in our country in
May, I see the same thing" (Poulsen, 2007). As far back as 1994,
futurist and best-selling author Alvin Toffler claimed that cyberattacks
on the World Trade Center could be used to collapse the entire U.S.
economy. He predicted that

\[Terrorists or rogue states\] won't need to blow up the World Trade
Center. Instead, they'll feed signals into computers from Libya or
Tehran or Pyongyang and shut down the whole banking system if they want
to. We know a former senior intelligence official who says, "Give me \$1
million and 20 people and I will shut down America. I could close down
all the automated teller machines, the Federal Reserve, Wall Street and
most hospital and business computer systems." (Elias, 1994, p. F10)

[But we have not seen **anything close** to the kinds of scenarios
outlined]{.underline} by **[Yoran]{.underline}**, [Ergma, Toffler, and
others. **Terrorists** did not use **cyberattack** against the World
Trade Center]{.underline}; [they used hijacked]{.underline}
[aircraft]{.underline}. [The attack of 9/11 did not lead to the
long-term **collapse** of the U.S. **economy**]{.underline}; [we would
have to wait for the impacts of years of **bad mortgages**]{.underline}
[for a **financial meltdown**]{.underline}. [Nor did the
**cyberattacks** on Estonia **approximate** what happened on
**9/11**,]{.underline} [as Yoran has claimed, and certainly not nuclear
**warfare** as Ergma has claim]{.underline}ed. In fact, a scientist at
the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, which was
established in Tallinn, Estonia, in response to the 2007 cyberattacks,
has written that the immediate impacts of those attacks were "minimal"
or "nonexistent," and that "no critical services were permanently
affected" (Ottis, 2010, p. 72).

Nonetheless, [many]{.underline} cybersecurity [proponents continue to
offer **cyber**-doom]{.underline} **[scenarios]{.underline}** [that not
only make analogies to weapons of mass destruction
(**WMDs**]{.underline}) [and the terrorist attacks of
**9/11**]{.underline}, [but also hold out **economic**, **social**, and
even **civilizational collapse**]{.underline} [as
**possible**]{.underline} impacts of cyberattacks. A report from the
Hoover Institution has warned of so-called "eWMDs" (Kelly & Almann,
2008); the FBI has warned that a cyberattack could have the same impact
as a "well-placed bomb" ("FBI warns brewing cyberwar," 2010); and
official U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) documents refer to "weapons of
mass disruption," implying that cyberattacks might have impacts
comparable to the use of WMD (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
2004, 2006). John Arquilla, one of the first to theorize cyberwar in the
1990s (Arquilla & Ronfeldt, 1997), has spoken of "a grave and growing
capacity for crippling our tech-dependent society," and has said that a
"cyber 9/11" is a matter of when, not if (Arquilla, 2009, p. E2). Mike
McConnell, who has claimed that we are already in an ongoing cyberwar
(McConnell, 2010), has predicted that a cyberattack could surpass the
impacts of 9/11 "by an order of magnitude" (Fisher, 2010). Finally, some
have even compared the impacts of prospective cyberattacks to the 2004
Indian Ocean tsunami that killed roughly a quarter million people and
caused widespread Downloaded by \[Northeastern University\] at 15:34 04
October 2014 90 JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & POLITICS physical
destruction in five countries (Meyer, 2010), suggested that cyberattack
could pose an "existential threat" to the United States ("FBI warns
brewing cyberwar," 2010), and offered the possibility that cyberattack
threatens the continued existence of "global civilization" (Adhikari,
2009).

\[Abstract\] Physical [damage resulting from **cyber

doom**]{.underline}" [narrative across societies]{.underline}
**[dependent]{.underline}** [on information and communication

characteristics of a development (i.e., web-technology proliferation)
matter in opinion formation, as sensitivity to digital threats to the

**[policymakers]{.underline}** [can expect to see **public

According to some, advancements in technological and organizational
capabilities among capable state and stateaffiliated actors over the
past decade increase the likelihood that offensive cyber operations
(OCOs) might soon produce destructive physical effects (Saltzman 2013;

[damage inflicted through **cyberspace** reinforce]{.underline} the
"**[cyber doom]{.underline}**" [narrative that digital insecurity might
result in a massive **failure**]{.underline} [of social and]{.underline}
[economic **processes**]{.underline} across societies dependent on new
information technologies and that dread of such failure permeates public
perspectives on cyber issues (Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009).

For those who study public opinion surrounding foreign policymaking, the
"cyber doom" type of narrative is not especially uncommon. Environmental
circumstances of sufficient visibility and meaning, such as the
trauma-inducing experiences of 9/11 or the Cold War, often take on life
of their own and affect opinion formation independent of an individuals'
priors or the cues of elites. Oddly, however, the oft-referenced notion
of "cyber doom" appears paradoxical, even despite the link some scholars
make between OCOs and physical effects.

Presently, conflict in cyberspace is characterized by
persistent-yet-limited effects and a condition of apparent restraint
exercised by cyber-capable actors (Maness and Valeriano 2016;
Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018a). Moreover, the unabated integration of
vulnerable information systems across all aspects of modern societies
raises the question of whether or not a sense of dread associated with
the exploitation of cyberspace is as severe as commonly portrayed
(Jarvis, Macdonald, and Whiting 2017). Most damningly, the idea that
"cyber doom" is most visible in Western national experiences as a fear
appeal employed by politicians to galvanize support for policy in no way
explains these curious logical shortcomings.

[At the heart of the "**cyber doom**]{.underline}" [narrative is the
assumption that **information** about]{.underline}
**[cyberattacks]{.underline}** released to the public---particularly
[information about]{.underline} sophisticated [cyber **operations** of
**foreign countries**]{.underline} and organized crime1--- [produces
**anxiety**]{.underline} about the digital health and security of a
person. [Ironically]{.underline}, [this assumed relationship between
**cyber operations**]{.underline}, [their portrayal in public-facing
media, and individual impact is often **discussed**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} **[unclear terms by]{.underline}**
**[scholars]{.underline}** [than is the determining role of
**techno-strategic conditions**]{.underline}.

**Expectations, [not reality]{.underline} drive narratives of "cyber
doom".**

[Our study finds that **sensitivity**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[cybersecurity]{.underline}** [threats is situationally shaped by
**exposure**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[negative
reporting]{.underline}** [but that the onset of associated **dread** is
**not a given**]{.underline}. [Instead, it is **influenced** by
**expectations of the role of technology**]{.underline} [in modern
society]{.underline}. [Respondents]{.underline} [dependent on such
technologies are not as prone to]{.underline} **[negative
effect]{.underline}** [as are those who remain]{.underline} [**not** so
deeply **embedded**]{.underline} [in the fabric of digital
society]{.underline}. [Both groups become more **sensitive** to
**cybersecurity threats**]{.underline} to [their person as the
information they consume becomes]{.underline} more [**negative**, and
this personal concern facilitates a **heightened
sensitivity**]{.underline} [to threats to the polity]{.underline}.
However, the dread predicted by the "cyber doom" narrative is only
weakly predictive of this dynamic and has no effect on the threat
sensitivity of those who do not respond emotionally. Finally, in both
cases, the link between concern for society is not a clear result of
negative information so much as it is the result of initial sensitivity
to threats at the personal level.

Consequently, we make two contributions. First, we show that [the impact
of novel **environmental circumstances**]{.underline} [on individual
**opinion**]{.underline} [formation is **shaped** by **issue
embeddedness**, suggesting that long-term exposure to any invasive
development mitigates the affective response it is associated
with]{.underline}. Second, we [present evidence suggesting
**nevertheless**]{.underline} [that the unique
**characteristics**]{.underline} [of such a development matter in
**opinion formation**, as sensitivity to **digital
threats**]{.underline} [to the polity is clearly premised on **personal
threat sensitivity**]{.underline}.

In conclusion, given this context, it would appear that **[while policy
may not in itself restrict civil liberties]{.underline}**, [it promotes
the **discourse**]{.underline} [which could **facilitate the enactment

among **security**]{.underline} [advisors with the lack of
**regulation**]{.underline} [and the inaction of cybersecurity
policy]{.underline}, despite the protection it offers to civil
liberties. Regulation might be an unpalatable word for both the left and
the right in the U.S., but it is generally accepted that in cases of
national emergency, it is sometimes necessary for the government to step
in. [The history of the **discourse** of '**national

**exceptional responses** can]{.underline} **[be
justified]{.underline}** [when this discourse is

government towards the issuing of]{.underline} **[exceptional

employed during a '**state of emergency'**]{.underline} [vaguely defined

virtually **no limit** on its **scope or length of**]{.underline}

#### Rejection in all instances is necessary to break the pipeline capital has built between scholarship and the war machine

**Neocleous, 18** -- Professor of the Critique of Political Economy at
Brunel University. (Mark Neocleous, "The bleak rituals of progress; or,
if somebody offers you a socially responsible innovation in security,
just say no," *Socially Responsible Innovation in Security*, Routledge,
2018, pg. 129-139)//ILake-MO

[Understanding security's imperative]{.underline} to win [requires a
grasp of security as the leitmotif of bourgeois modernity.]{.underline}
It requires understanding that [security can never be disconnected from
the powers of war and police to which it belongs, and therefore never
disconnected from capital which operates]{.underline} with and through
[these powers. It requires an understanding of security not
a]{.underline}s a [universal]{.underline} value bu[t as a mechanism of
domination deployed by state and capital]{.underline}, and that this
deployment of security is [part and parcel of the wider politics of fear
which underpins bourgeois modernity.]{.underline} Far from being
something that could ever be genuinely achieved, security exists for the
opportunities it offers to get things done in its name. [Security is a
mechanism to mobilize, discipline and punish.]{.underline} In other
words, [security is a power for the fabrication of social
order]{.underline} (Neocleous, 2000).

[This power lies partly in the fact that in a so-called 'age of rights',
security is often presented]{.underline} to us [as]{.underline} the most
[fundamental]{.underline} of all rights. According to the United
Nations, the fundamental rights of all human beings are 'life, liberty
and security'. This claim repeats the revolutionary discourse of rights
in the eighteenth century, and one thinker who noticed the implications
of such a claim was Marx. In late 1843 in an exchange with Bruno Bauer
over 'the Jewish question', Marx runs through the various declarations
of the rights of man announced by various states in the late eighteenth
century, along with the constitutions which tended to follow such
declarations. Marx points out that the rights in question, though
revolutionary in some (liberal) ways, are still nonetheless the rights
of a member of bourgeois society, 'of egoistic man, of man separated
from other men and from the community'. 'Let us hear what the most
radical Constitution, the Constitution of 1793, has to say', he
suggests, and then notes Article 2 of that Constitution: 'These rights,
etc., (the natural and imprescriptible rights) are: equality, liberty,
security, property'. Marx works through these ideas. Liberty, for
example, is 'the power which man has to do everything that does not harm
the rights of others', according to one Declaration, or 'being able to
do everything which does not harm others', in another. Liberty is thus
'the right to do everything that harms no one else'. J. S. Mill would
later confirm this in his articulation of the 'harm principle' in On
Liberty, but Marx treats it as nothing less than the 'right of ...
separation, the right of the restricted individual, withdrawn into
himself'. The practical application of this right to liberty is man's
right to private property, Marx notes, 'the right to enjoy one's
property and to dispose of it at one's discretion ... without regard to
other men, independently of society'. This 'right of self-interest ...
makes every man see in other men not the realization of his own freedom,
but the barrier to it'. Such observations essentially launch Marx's
critique of both rights discourses through the rest of his work, but
note what he says about security at this moment. On the one hand, the
[rights discourse is]{.underline} the realization of equality, which is
nothing but the equality in which each person is regarded as such a
self-sufficient monad. It is also, on the other hand, [the raison d'être
of security.]{.underline} Marx cites Article 8 of the French
Constitution of 1793 -- 'security consists in the protection afforded by
society to each of its members for the preservation of his person, his
rights, and his property' -- before making the following comment:

> Security is the highest social concept of civil society, the concept
> of police, expressing the fact that the whole of society exists only
> in order to guarantee to each of its members the preservation of his
> person, his rights, and his property

As such, [security is the insurance of the egoism of bourgeois
society]{.underline} (Marx, 1844/1975, pp. 162--164). Marx has put his
finger on the core ideological concept of bourgeois modernity: security.
[Security underpins and overrides the other egotistic rights associated
with bourgeois modernity -- liberty, property, equality -- in order that
bourgeois egoism and capitalist order be guaranteed.]{.underline}

Now, I have previously taken Marx's comment to be a precursor to his
claim a few years later in The Manifesto of the Communist Party about
the bourgeoisie constantly 'revolutionizing the instruments of
production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the
whole relations of society'. [The 'constant revolutionizing of
production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social
conditions]{.underline}, everlasting uncertainty and agitation' which
[accompanies bourgeois rule is what gets described today in the language
of insecurity]{.underline} (Marx and Engels, 1848/1984, p. 487).
Understood in terms of what has become the most important political
trope of contemporary politics, the suggestion seems to be that **[at
some fundamental level the order of capital is an order of social
insecurity. And yet]{.underline}**, at the same time, **[this permanent
insecurity gives rise to a politics of security, reinforcing security's
place as the fundamental concept of bourgeois society.]{.underline}** I
have previously argued that this can be interpreted in terms of the ways
in which [security serves as a key principle of police power
in]{.underline} constituting and [regulating capital and its modes of
coercion and control]{.underline} -- the security of the community
coincides with the security of the commodity -- and have suggested that
[**what is** therefore now **needed** more than anything **is** nothing
less than **a critique of security**]{.underline} (Neocleous, 2008, also
2000, 2014, 2016; Neocleous and Rigakos, 2011). If we take seriously a
comment Marx makes (1843/1975, p. 142) in his debate with Ruge, that
[**the main task** before us **is not to change the world** in the way
envisaged by some socialists **but, rather,** the **ruthless critique**
of all that exists]{.underline}, including and especially politics, law
and religion, then we might say that [for us right now **the target of**
such a **ruthless critique has to be** that new political religion
called **'security'.** Such a critique must have as its target all the
'innovations' performed in security's name, including those claiming to
be 'socially responsible'.]{.underline}

https://www.academia.edu/2292255/Anti-security_A_Declaration

The purpose of the project, put simply, is to show that [security is an
illusion that has forgotten it is an illusion]{.underline}. Less simply,
that [security is]{.underline} a **[dangerous]{.underline}** illusion.
Why 'dangerous'? [Because it has come to act as **a blockage on
politics**: the more we succumb to the discourse of security, the less
we can say about **exploitation** and **alienation**; the more we talk
about security, the less we talk about **the material foundations of
emancipation**; the more we come to share in the fetish of security, the
more we become **alienated** from one another and the more we become
**complicit in the exercise of police powers**]{.underline}.

Fleshing out how we got here is the first challenge; showing how
damaging this has been is an even greater challenge; doing these things
in a way that contributes to a radical, critical and emancipatory
politics even more so. But it is a challenge that must be made, and must
be made collectively. As a start, we therefore offer the following
declarations about an Anti-Security politics. \[end page 15\]

[We deny all false binaries that obfuscate and reify the security
problematic and serve only to reinforce its power]{.underline}. We
therefore reject:

\* Liberty versus Security: In the works of the founders of the liberal
tradition - that is, the founders of bourgeois ideology - liberty is
security and security is liberty. For the ruling class, security always
has and always will triumph over liberty because 'liberty' has never
been intended as a counter-weight to security. [Liberty has always been
security's lawyer.]{.underline}

\* Public versus Private: No post-hoc juridical determination about
accountability, legal standing, uniforming, or legitimate use of force
can undo the historic inter-operability of public and private police,
state and mercenary armies, corporate and government security, or
transnational corporations and international relations. The public
sphere does the work of the private sphere, civil society the work of
the state. [The question is therefore not 'public versus private' or
'civil \[end page 16\] society versus the state', but the unity of
bourgeois violence and the means by which pacification is legitimized in
the name of security.]{.underline}

\* Soft versus Hard: Such dichotomous constructions -- soft versus hard
policing for suppressing dissent; soft versus hard military intervention
for stamping out local and indigenous resistance; soft versus hard power
to impose global imperial hegemony -- are but aspects of the unity of
class violence, distracting us from universal pacification carried out
in the name of capital.

\* Barbarism versus Civilization: [The history of civilization after the
Enlightenment is the consolidation of **wage labour**, the cultural and
material imposition of **imperial domination**, and the violence of
**class war**]{.underline}. In the form of the 'standard of
civilization' the majesty of the Law was central to this project. [To
civilize is to project police power. 'Civilization' is code for
**enforcing capitalist relations**; which is to say: bourgeois
civilization is barbarism]{.underline}. \[end page 17\]

\* Domestic versus Foreign: [The greatest tyranny of security is its
insistence on the construction of the **'other'**. Security creates both
internal domestic and external foreign threats, generating]{.underline}
the [fear and division]{.underline} [that underpins raison d'état. The
colonial pacification of subjects abroad is soon turned into domestic
pacification of subjects at home]{.underline}. New international
policing initiatives are but a laboratory for the militarization of
domestic security. The 'war on terror' is a permanent multi-front
assault that lumps jihadists with peaceniks, feminists with Islamists,
and socialists with assassins. No pretence at a distinction is necessary
because the capitalist state is insecure in all directions.

\* Pre- and post-9/11: Let's be clear: the murder of 3,000 on September
11, 2001 was horrific, but it did not change anything. To believe so is
to engage in a deliberate act of forgetting. The security apparatus that
revved up in the days after the attack had been in the making for
decades as the \[end page 18\] terrain of the class war shifted. The
targets of the new 'war' - this time on terror - were not new. The cry
of 'insecurity' was again answered with two familiar demands: you
consume, and we will destroy. Go to Disneyland, and let the state
continue the work it had been conducting for generations. If 9/11
accomplished anything, it was to make security all but unassailable.

\* Exception and Normality: [This is not a state of exception. The
capitalist state riding roughshod over human rights in the name of
security is **normal**. The ruling class carrying out acts of violence
in the name of accumulation is normal. The devising of new techniques to
discipline and punish recalcitrant subjects is normal. Targeted
assassinations, the bombing of civilians, imprisonment without trial...
**normal, normal, normal**]{.underline}. And, lest we forget: liberals
falling over themselves justify such things? Normal. \[end page 19\]

[We understand instead that security today]{.underline}:

\* [operates as the supreme concept of bourgeois society]{.underline}.

\* [**colonizes and de-radicalizes discourse**: hunger to food security;
imperialism to energy security; globalization to supply chain security;
welfare to social security; personal safety to private security.
Security makes **bourgeois** all that is inherently communal. It
alienates us from solutions that are naturally social and forces us to
speak the language of **state rationality**, **corporate interest**, and
**individual egoism**. Instead of sharing, we hoard. Instead of helping,
we build dependencies. Instead of feeding others, we let them starve...
**all in the name of security**]{.underline}.

\* [is a special commodity, playing a pivotal role in the
**exploitation**, **alienation** and **immiseration** of workers. It
produces its own fetish, embedding itself into all other commodities,
producing **even more risk** and fear while intensifying and distracting
us from the **material conditions of exploitation** that
have]{.underline} \[end page 20\] [made us inherently insecure. It makes
concrete our ephemeral insecurities under capitalist relations. It
attempts to satiate through consumption what can only be achieved
through revolution]{.underline}.

[The call of this Declaration is that we:]{.underline}

\* [name security for what it really is]{.underline};

\* [stand **against** the securitization of political
discourse]{.underline};

\* [**challenge** the authoritarian and reactionary nature of
security]{.underline};

\* [point to the ways in which security politics shifts attention away
from material conditions and questions, in the process transforming
emancipatory politics into an arm of police]{.underline};

\* [fight for **an alternative political language** that takes us beyond
the narrow horizon of bourgeois security and its police
powers]{.underline}...

In 2009, the UK government's chief scientific adviser Sir John
Beddington [warned that without mitigating and preventive action
'drivers' of global crisis like demographic expansion, environmental
degradation and energy depletion could lead to a 'perfect storm' of
simultaneous food, water and energy crises by around 2030.1 Yet, for the
most part, conventional policy responses from national governments and
international institutions have been decidedly inadequate.]{.underline}
Part of [the problem is the way in which these crises are conceptualised
in relation to security. Traditional disciplinary divisions in the
social and natural sciences, compounded by **bureaucratic
compartmentalisation** in policy-planning and decision-making, has meant
these crises are frequently approached as largely **separate processes**
with their own internal dynamics.]{.underline}

While it is increasingly acknowledged that [cross-disciplinary
approaches are necessary]{.underline}, [these have largely failed to
recognise just how inherently interconnected these crises
are]{.underline}. As Brauch points out, 'most [studies in the
environmental security debate since 1990 have ignored or failed to
integrate the contributions of the global environmental change community
in the natural sciences.]{.underline} To a large extent the latter has
also failed to integrate the results of this debate.' 2 [Underlying this
problem is the lack of a holistic systems approach to thinking about not
only global crises, but their **causal origins** in the social,
political, economic, ideological and value structures of the
contemporary international system.]{.underline} Indeed, [it is often
assumed that these contemporary structures are largely what need to be
'secured' and protected from the dangerous impacts of global crises,
rather than transformed precisely to **ameliorate these crises** in the
first place]{.underline}. Consequently, [policy-makers frequently
overlook existing **systemic** and **structural** obstacles to the
implementation of desired reforms]{.underline}.

In a modest effort to contribute to the lacuna identified by Brauch,
this paper begins with an empirically-oriented, interdisciplinary
exploration of the best available data on four major global crises --
climate change, energy depletion, food scarcity and global financial
instability -- illustrating the systemic interconnections between
different [crises, and revealing that their causal origins are not
accidental but **inherent to the structural failings** and
vulnerabilities of existing global political, economic and cultural
institutions]{.underline}. This empirical evaluation leads to a critical
appraisal of orthodox realist and liberal approaches to global crises in
international theory and policy[. This critique argues principally that
orthodox IR reifies a highly fragmented, de-historicised ontology of the
international system which underlies a reductionist, technocratic and
compartmentalised conceptual and methodological approach to global
crises. Consequently, rather than global crises being understood
causally and holistically in the systemic context of the structure of
the international system, they are 'securitised' as amplifiers of
traditional security threats, requiring **counter-productive militarised
responses** and/or futile inter-state negotiations]{.underline}. While
the systemic causal context of global crisis convergence and
acceleration is thus elided, [this simultaneously exacerbates the danger
of reactionary violence, the problematisation of populations in regions
impacted by these crises and the naturalisation of the consequent
proliferation of wars and humanitarian disasters.]{.underline} This
moves us away from the debate over whether resource 'shortages' or
'abundance' causes conflicts, to [the question of how either can
generate crises which undermine conventional socio-political orders and
confound conventional IR discourses, in turn radicalising the processes
of social polarisation that can culminate in violent
conflict.]{.underline}

**[Knowledge-making]{.underline}** in the modern/colonial world [is at
once knowledge in which **the very concept of 'modernity' rests** and
the judge and warrantor of legitimate and sustainable
knowledge]{.underline}. Vandana Shiva (1993) suggested ['monocultures of
the mind' to describe Western imperial knowledge, its totalitarian and
epistemically non-democratic implementation.]{.underline}11
Knowledge-making presupposes a semiotic code (languages, images, sounds,
colors, etc.) shared between users in semiotic exchanges. It is a common
human endeavor (I would say of any living organism, since without
'knowing' life cannot be sustained). Taking a short cut from general
conditions of knowledge-making among human beings sensu largo (that is,
without racist and gender/sexual normativity) to knowledge-making in the
organization of society, institutions are created that accomplish two
functions: training of new (epistemic obedient) members and control of
who enters and what knowledge-making is allowed, disavowed, devalued or
celebrated. [Knowledge-making entrenched with imperial/colonial
purposes]{.underline}, [from the European Renaissance to the US
neoliberalism]{.underline} (that is, political economy as advanced by
F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman) that guided the last stage of
globalization (from Ronald Reagan to the Wall Street collapse), was
grounded -- as mentioned before -- in specific languages, institutions
and geo-historical locations. [The languages of Western
imperial/knowledgemaking]{.underline} (and the self-definition of the
West -- the West of Jerusalem -- by social actors that saw themselves as
Western Christians) [were practiced]{.underline} (speaking and writing)
[by social actors]{.underline} (human beings) [dwelling in a specific
geo-historical space, with specific memories that said actors
constructed and reconstructed in the process of creating their own
Christian, Western and European identity.]{.underline} Briefly, the
formal apparatus of enunciation is the basic apparatus for engaging in
institutional and purposive knowledge-making geo-politically oriented.
Originally theology was the overarching conceptual and cosmo - logical
frame of knowledge-making in which social actors engaged and
institutions (monasteries, churches, universities, states, etc.) were
created. Secularization, in the 18th century, displaced Christian
theology and secular philosophy and science took its place. Both frames,
theological and secular, bracketed their geo-historical foundation and,
instead, made of theology and philosophy/science a frame of knowledge
beyond geo-historical and body location. The subject of theological
knowledge depended on the dictates of God while the subject of secular
philosophy/science depended on Reason, on the Cartesian ego/mind and
Kant's transcendental reason. Thus, Western imperial knowledge was cast
in Western imperial languages and was theopolitically and
ego-politically founded. Such foundation legitimizes the assumptions and
claims that knowledge was beyond bodies and places and that Christian
theology and secular philosophy and science were the limits of
knowledge-making beyond and besides which all knowledge was lacking:
folklore, myth, traditional knowledge, were invented to legitimize
imperial epistemology. Theo- and ego-politics of knowledge also
bracketed the body in knowledge-making (Mignolo, 2007a). [By locating
knowledge in the mind only, and bracketing **'secondary
qualities'**]{.underline} (**[affects]{.underline}**,
**[emotions]{.underline}**, **[desires]{.underline}**, anger,
humiliation, etc.), [social actors who happened to be
white]{.underline}, inhabiting Europe/ Western Christendom [and speaking
**specific languages** assumed that what was right for them in that
place and which fulfilled their affects]{.underline}, [emotions, fears
and angers was indeed valid for the rest of the planet and,
consequently, that they were the **depositor**,]{.underline} warrantor,
creator **[and distributor]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[universal
knowledge]{.underline}**. In the process of globally enacting the
European system of belief and structure of knowledge, human beings who
were not Christian did not inhabit the memories of Europe, from Greece
through Rome, were not familiar with the six modern imperial European
languages and, frankly, did not care much about all of that until they
realized that they were expected and requested to submit to the European
(and in the 20th century to the United States also), knowledge, belief,
life style and world view. Responses to the contrary came, since the
16th century, from all over the globe, but imperial theo- and
ego-politics of knowledge managed to prevail through economically
sustained institutions (universities, museums, delegations, state
officers, armies, etc.). Now, the type of responses I am referring to
were responses provoked by the making and remaking of the colonial
matrix of power: a complex conceptual structure that guided actions in
the domain of economy (exploitation of labor and appropriation of land/
natural resources), authority (government, military forces),
gender/sexuality and knowledge/subjectivity. Since the responses I am
referring to were responses to the colonial matrix of power, I would
describe such responses as de-colonial (Mignolo, 2007b). The
cases/examples I offered in Section III also show that in such responses
de-colonial geo-politics of knowledge confronted imperial theo- and
ego-politically based assumptions on the universality of Western
knowledge-making and institutional grounding. But there is still another
dimension in de-colonial politics of knowledge relevant for my argument:
[the claim that knowledge-making for well being rather than for
controlling and managing populations for imperial interest shall come
from **local experiences and needs,**]{.underline} [rather than from
local **imperial experiences**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[needs
projected to the globe]{.underline}**, invokes also the body-politics of
knowledge. Why? [Because]{.underline} [not only]{.underline}
[regions]{.underline} [and locales in which imperial
languages]{.underline} [were not]{.underline} ancestrally
[spoken]{.underline} and that were alien to the history of Greek and
Latin were [disqualified]{.underline} and the disqualification filled
with knowledge-product and knowledge-making in bodies and institutions
where the conceptual warranty of Greek and Latin legitimized the belief
of their dwelling in the universal, [but]{.underline} [bodies
too]{.underline}. [Racism]{.underline}, as we sense it today, [was the
result of]{.underline} two conceptual inventions of **[imperial
knowledge]{.underline}**: that certain bodies were inferior to others,
and that inferior bodies carried inferior intelligence. The emergence of
a body-politics of knowledge is a second strand of de-colonial thinking
and the de-colonial option. You can still argue that there are 'bodies'
and 'regions' in need of guidance from developed 'bodies' and 'regions'
that got there first and know how to do it. [As an honest liberal,
you]{.underline} would recognize that you [do not want to 'impose' your
knowledge and experience]{.underline} [but to 'work with the
locals']{.underline}. **[The problem is, what agenda will be
implemented, yours or theirs?]{.underline}** Back then to Chatterjee and
Smith. [De-colonial thinking presupposes de-linking **(epistemically and
politically**)]{.underline} [from the web of imperial
knowledge]{.underline} (theo- and ego-politically grounded) from
disciplinary management. A common topic of conversation today, after the
financial crisis on Wall Street, is 'how to save capitalism'. [A
de-colonial question would be: 'Why would you want to save capitalism
and not save human beings?]{.underline} Why save an abstract entity and
not the human lives that capitalism is constantly destroying?' In the
same vein, geo- and body-politics of knowledge, de-colonial thinking and
the de-colonial option place human lives and life in general first
rather than making claims for the 'transformation of the disciplines'.
But, still, [claiming life and human lives first]{.underline},
[de-colonial thinking is not joining forces with **'the politics of life
in itself'**]{.underline} as Nicholas Rose (2007) has it. Rose's
'[politics of life in itself']{.underline} [is the last development
in]{.underline} the 'mercantilization of life' and **[of
'bio-power']{.underline}** (as Foucault has it). In the 'politics of
life in itself' political and economic strategies for controlling life
at the same time as creating more consumers join forces.
[Bio-politics]{.underline}, in Foucault's conception, [was one of the
**practical consequences** of an ego-politics of knowledge implemented
in the **sphere of the state**]{.underline}. Politics of life in itself
extends it to the market. Thus, politics of life in itself describes the
enormous potential of bio-technology to generate consumers who invest
their earnings in buying health-promoting products in order to maintain
the reproduction of technology that will 'improve' the control of human
beings at the same time as creating more wealth through the money
invested by consumers who buy health-promoting technology. This is the
point where [de-colonial options]{.underline}, grounded in geo- and
body-politics of knowledge, [engage in both **decolonizing knowledge**
and **decolonial knowledge-making,** delinking from the web of
**imperial/modern** knowledge and from the **colonial matrix of
power**.]{.underline}

Theory & Event, https://muse.jhu.edu/article/218079

[This essay develops a theory]{.underline} about the causes of war \--
[and]{.underline} thus [aims to generate lines of action and critique
for peace \-- that cuts beneath analyses based either on a given
sequence of events, threats, **insecurities** and political
manipulation, or the play of institutional, economic or political
interests (the **\'military-industrial complex\'**).]{.underline} Such
factors are important to be sure, and should not be discounted, but they
flow over a deeper bedrock of modern reason that has not only come to
form a powerful structure of common sense but the apparently solid
ground of the real itself. In this light, the two
**[\'existential\']{.underline}** and \'rationalist\' [discourses of
**war-making** and **justification**]{.underline} mobilised in the
Lebanon war [are **more** than merely **arg**ument**s**, rhetorics or
even discourses]{.underline}. Certainly [they **mobilise** forms of
knowledge and power **together**; providing political leaderships,
media, citizens, bureaucracies and military forces with **organising
systems of belief**, **action**, analysis and
**rationale**]{.underline}. But they run deeper than that. [They are
**truth-systems** of the most powerful and fundamental kind that we have
in modernity: **ontologies**]{.underline}, statements [about truth and
being which claim a **rarefied privilege** to **state what is** and
**how it must be maintained** as it is]{.underline}. I am thinking of
ontology in both its senses: [ontology as both a statement about the
nature and ideality of being (in this case **political being**, that of
the **nation-state**), and as a statement of epistemological truth and
certainty, of methods and processes of arriving at certainty (in this
case, the development and **application** of **strategic
knowledge**]{.underline} for the use of armed force, [and the
**creation** and **maintenance** of **geopolitical order**, **security**
and **national survival**]{.underline}). These derive from the classical
idea of ontology as a speculative or positivistic inquiry into the
fundamental nature of truth, of being, or of some phenomenon; the desire
for a solid metaphysical account of things inaugurated by Aristotle, an
account of \'being qua being and its essential attributes\'.17 In
contrast, drawing on Foucauldian theorising about truth and power, I see
ontology as a particularly powerful claim to truth itself: a claim to
the status of an underlying systemic foundation for truth, identity,
existence and action; one that is not essential or timeless, but is
thoroughly historical and contingent, that is deployed and mobilised in
a fraught and conflictual socio-political context of some kind. In
short, ontology is the \'politics of truth\'18 in its most sweeping and
powerful form. [I see]{.underline} such [a **drive** for **ontological
certainty** and completion as particularly problematic]{.underline} for
a number of reasons. Firstly, when it takes the form of the existential
and rationalist ontologies of war, [it amounts to a hard and
**exclusivist claim**: a drive for **ideational hegemony** and
**closure** that **limits debate** and **questioning**, that
**confines** it within the boundaries of a particular, **closed system
of logic**, one that is **grounded** in the **truth of
being**]{.underline}, in the truth of truth as such. The second is its
intimate relation with violence: [the dual ontologies **represent** a
simultaneously **social** and **conceptual structure** that **generates
violence**]{.underline}. [Here we are witness to an **epistemology of
violence** (strategy) joined to an **ontology of violence** (the
national security state).]{.underline} When we consider their relation
to war, the two ontologies are especially dangerous because [each
alone]{.underline} (and doubly in combination) [tends both to
**quicken** the **resort to war** and to **lead to its escalation**
either in **scale** and **duration**, or in **unintended effects**. In
such a context violence is not so much a tool that can be picked up and
used on occasion, at limited cost and with limited impact \-- it
**permeates being**]{.underline}. This essay describes firstly the
ontology of the national security state (by way of the political
philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, Carl Schmitt and G. W. F. Hegel) and
secondly the rationalist ontology of strategy (by way of the
geopolitical thought of Henry Kissinger), showing how they crystallise
into a mutually reinforcing system of support and justification,
especially in the thought of Clausewitz. This creates both a profound
ethical and pragmatic problem. The ethical problem arises because of
their militaristic force \-- they embody and reinforce a norm of war \--
and because they enact what Martin Heidegger calls an \'enframing\'
image of technology and being in which humans are merely utilitarian
instruments for use, control and destruction, and force \-- in the words
of one famous Cold War strategist \-- can be thought of as a \'power to
hurt\'.19 The pragmatic problem arises because force so often produces
neither the linear system of effects imagined in strategic theory nor
anything we could meaningfully call security, but rather turns in upon
itself in a nihilistic spiral of pain and destruction. In the era of a
\'war on terror\' dominantly conceived in Schmittian and Clausewitzian
terms,20 the arguments of Hannah Arendt (that violence collapses ends
into means) and Emmanuel Levinas (that \'every war employs arms that
turn against those that wield them\') take on added significance.
Neither, however, explored what occurs when war and being are made to
coincide, other than Levinas\' intriguing comment that in war persons
\'play roles in which they no longer recognises themselves, making them
betray not only commitments but their own substance\'. 21 What I am
trying to describe in this essay is a complex relation between, and
interweaving of, epistemology and ontology. But it is not my view that
these are distinct modes of knowledge or levels of truth, because in the
social field named by security, statecraft and violence they are made to
blur together, continually referring back on each other, like charges
darting between electrodes. Rather they are related systems of knowledge
with particular systemic roles and intensities of claim about truth,
political being and political necessity. Positivistic or scientific
claims to epistemological truth supply an air of predictability and
reliability to policy and political action, which in turn support larger
ontological claims to national being and purpose, drawing them into a
common horizon of certainty that is one of the central features of
past-Cartesian modernity. Here it may be useful to see ontology as a
more totalising and metaphysical set of claims about truth, and
epistemology as more pragmatic and instrumental; but while a distinction
between epistemology (knowledge as technique) and ontology (knowledge as
being) has analytical value, it tends to break down in action. The
epistemology of violence I describe here (strategic science and foreign
policy doctrine) claims positivistic clarity about techniques of
military and geopolitical action which use force and coercion to achieve
a desired end, an end that is supplied by the ontological claim to
national existence, security, or order. However in practice, technique
quickly passes into ontology. This it does in two ways. First,
instrumental violence is married to an ontology of insecure national
existence which itself admits no questioning. The nation and its
identity are known and essential, prior to any conflict, and the resort
to violence becomes an equally essential predicate of its perpetuation.
In this way knowledge-as-strategy claims, in a positivistic fashion, to
achieve a calculability of effects (power) for an ultimate purpose
(securing being) that it must always assume. Second, strategy as a
technique not merely becomes an instrument of state power but
ontologises itself in a technological image of \'man\' as a maker and
user of things, including other humans, which have no essence or
integrity outside their value as objects. In Heidegger\'s terms,
technology becomes being; epistemology immediately becomes technique,
immediately being. This combination could be seen in the aftermath of
the 2006 Lebanon war, whose obvious strategic failure for Israelis
generated fierce attacks on the army and political leadership and forced
the resignation of the IDF chief of staff. Yet in its wake neither
ontology was rethought. Consider how a reserve soldier, while on
brigade-sized manoeuvres in the Golan Heights in early 2007, was quoted
as saying: \'we are ready for the next war\'. Uri Avnery quoted Israeli
commentators explaining the rationale for such a war as being to
\'eradicate the shame and restore to the army the \"deterrent power\"
that was lost on the battlefields of that unfortunate war\'. In
\'Israeli public discourse\', he remarked, \'the next war is seen as a
natural phenomenon, like tomorrow\'s sunrise.\' 22 The danger obviously
raised here is that these dual ontologies of war link being, means,
events and decisions into a single, unbroken chain whose very process of
construction cannot be examined. As is clear in the work of Carl
Schmitt, being implies action, the action that is war. This chain is
also obviously at work in the U.S. neoconservative doctrine that argues,
as Bush did in his 2002 West Point speech, that \'the only path to
safety is the path of action\', which begs the question of whether
strategic practice and theory can be detached from strong ontologies of
the insecure nation-state.23 This is the direction taken by much realist
analysis critical of Israel and the Bush administration\'s \'war on
terror\'.24 Reframing such concerns in Foucauldian terms, we could argue
that obsessive ontological commitments have led to especially disturbing
\'problematizations\' of truth.25 However such rationalist critiques
rely on a one-sided interpretation of Clausewitz that seeks to
disentangle strategic from existential reason, and to open up choice in
that way. However without interrogating more deeply how they form a
conceptual harmony in Clausewitz\'s thought \-- and thus in our dominant
understandings of politics and war \-- tragically violent \'choices\'
will continue to be made. The essay concludes by pondering a normative
problem that arises out of its analysis: [if the divisive ontology of
the national security state and the violent and instrumental vision of
**\'enframing\'** have]{.underline}, as Heidegger suggests, [come to
**define being**]{.underline} and drive \'out every other possibility of
revealing being\', [how can they be escaped**?**]{.underline}26 [How can
other]{.underline} choices and [**alternatives** be found and
enacted**?**]{.underline} How is there any scope for agency and
resistance in the face of them? Their social and discursive power \--
one that aims to take up the entire space of the political \-- needs to
be respected and understood. However, [we are far from powerless in the
face of them. The need is to **critique dominant images** of political
being and **dominant ways** of **securing** that **being** at the same
time]{.underline}, and to act and choose [such that we bring into the
world a more **sustainable**, **peaceful** and **non-violent global rule
of the political**]{.underline}. Friend and Enemy: Violent Ontologies of
the Nation-State In his Politics Among Nations Hans Morgenthau stated
that \'the national interest of a peace-loving nation can only be
defined in terms of national security, which is the irreducible minimum
that diplomacy must defend with adequate power and without compromise\'.
While Morgenthau defined security relatively narrowly \-- as the
\'integrity of the national territory and its institutions\' \-- in a
context where security was in practice defined expansively, as
synonymous with a state\'s broadest geopolitical and economic
\'interests\', what was revealing about his formulation was not merely
the ontological centrality it had, but the sense of urgency and priority
he accorded to it: it must be defended \'without compromise\'.27
Morgenthau was a thoughtful and complex thinker, and understood well the
complexities and dangers of using armed force. However his formulation
reflected an influential view about the significance of the political
good termed \'security\'. When this is combined with the way in which
[**security** was conceived in modern political thought as an
existential condition \-- a sine qua non of life and sovereign political
existence \-- and then married to war and instrumental action, it
provides a basic **underpinning** for either the **limitless** resort to
strategic **violence** without effective constraint, or the perseverance
of limited war (with its]{.underline} inherent [tendencies to
escalation)]{.underline} as a permanent feature of politics. While he
was no militarist, Morgenthau did say elsewhere (in, of all places, a
far-reaching critique of nuclear strategy) that the \'quantitative and
qualitative competition for conventional weapons is a rational
instrument of international politics\'.28 The conceptual template for
such an image of national security state can be found in the work of
Thomas Hobbes, with his influential conception of the political
community as a tight unity of sovereign and people in which their bodies
meld with his own to form a \'Leviathan\', and which must be defended
from enemies within and without. His image of effective security and
sovereignty was one that was intolerant of internal difference and
dissent, legitimating a strong state with coercive and exceptional
powers to preserve order and sameness. This was a vision not merely of
political order but of existential identity, set off against a range of
existential others who were sources of threat, backwardness, instability
or incongruity.29 It also, in a way set out with frightening clarity by
the theorist Carl Schmitt and the philosopher Georg Hegel, exchanged
internal unity, identity and harmony for permanent alienation from other
such communities (states). Hegel presaged Schmitt\'s thought with his
argument that individuality and the state are single moments of \'mind
in its freedom\' which \'has an infinitely negative relation to itself,
and hence its essential character from its own point of view is its
singleness\': Individuality is awareness of one\'s existence as a unit
in sharp distinction from others. It manifests itself here in the state
as a relation to other states, each of which is autonomous vis-a-vis the
others\...this negative relation of the state to itself is embodied in
the world as the relation of one state to another and as if the negative
were something external.30 Schmitt is important both for understanding
the way in which such alienation is seen as a definitive way of
imagining and limiting political communities, and for understanding how
such a rigid delineation is linked to the inevitability and perpetuation
of war. Schmitt argued that the existence of a state \'presupposes the
political\', which must be understood through \'the specific political
distinction\...between friend and enemy\'. The enemy is \'the other, the
stranger; and it sufficient for his nature that he is, in a specially
intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in an
extreme case conflicts with him are possible\'.31 The figure of the
enemy is constitutive of the state as \'the specific entity of a
people\'.32 Without it society is not political and a people cannot be
said to exist: Only the actual participants can correctly recognise,
understand and judge the concrete situation and settle the extreme case
of conflict\...to judge whether the adversary intends to negate his
opponent\'s way of life and therefore must be repulsed or fought in
order to preserve one\'s own form of existence.33 Schmitt links this
stark ontology to war when he states that the political is only
authentic \'when a fighting collectivity of people confronts a similar
collectivity. The enemy is solely the public enemy, because everything
that has a relationship to such a collectivity of men, particularly to
the whole nation, becomes public by virtue of such a relationship\...in
its entirety the state as an organised political entity decides for
itself the friend-enemy distinction\'.34 War, in short, is an
existential condition: the entire life of a human being is a struggle
and every human being is symbolically a combatant. The friend, enemy and
combat concepts receive their real meaning precisely because they refer
to the real possibility of physical killing. War follows from enmity.
War is the existential negation of the enemy.35 Schmitt claims that his
theory is not biased towards war as a choice (\'It is by no means as
though the political signifies nothing but devastating war and every
political deed a military action\...it neither favours war nor
militarism, neither imperialism nor pacifism\') but it is hard to accept
his caveat at face value.36 When such a theory takes the form of a
social discourse (which it does in a general form) such an ontology can
only support, as a kind of originary ground, the basic Clausewitzian
assumption that war can be a rational way of resolving political
conflicts \-- because the import of Schmitt\'s argument is that such
\'political\' conflicts are ultimately expressed through the possibility
of war. As he says: \'to the enemy concept belongs the ever-present
possibility of combat\'.37 Where Schmitt meets Clausewitz, as I explain
further below, the existential and rationalistic ontologies of war join
into a closed circle of mutual support and justification. This [closed
circle of existential and strategic reason generates]{.underline} a
number of [dangers]{.underline}. Firstly, the emergence of conflict can
generate military action almost automatically simply [because the world
is **conceived** in terms of the distinction between **friend** and
**enemy**; because the very existence of **the other** constitutes an
**unacceptable threat**]{.underline}, rather than a chain of actions,
judgements and decisions. (As the Israelis insisted of Hezbollah, they
\'deny our right to exist\'.) [This **effaces agency**, causality and
responsibility from policy and political **discourse**: our actions can
be conceived as **independent** of the conflict or quarantined from
critical enquiry]{.underline}, as necessities that achieve an
instrumental purpose but do not contribute to a new and unpredictable
causal chain. Similarly the Clausewitzian idea of force \-- which, by
transporting a Newtonian category from the natural into the social
sciences, assumes the very effect it seeks \-- further encourages the
resort to military violence. We ignore the complex history of a
conflict, and thus the alternative paths to its resolution that such
historical analysis might provide, by portraying conflict as fundamental
and existential in nature; as possibly containable or exploitable, but
always irresolvable. Dominant portrayals of the war on terror, and the
Israeli-Arab conflict, are arguably examples of such ontologies in
action. Secondly, the militaristic force of such an ontology is visible,
in Schmitt, in the absolute sense of vulnerability whereby a people can
judge whether their \'adversary intends to negate his opponent\'s way of
life\'.38 Evoking the kind of thinking that would become controversial
in the Bush doctrine, Hegel similarly argues that: \...a state may
regard its infinity and honour as at stake in each of its concerns,
however minute, and it is all the more inclined to susceptibility to
injury the more its strong individuality is impelled as a result of long
domestic peace to seek and create a sphere of activity abroad. \....the
state is in essence mind and therefore cannot be prepared to stop at
just taking notice of an injury after it has actually occurred. On the
contrary, there arises in addition as a cause of strife the idea of such
an injury\...39 Identity, even more than physical security or autonomy,
is put at stake in such thinking and can be defended and redeemed
through warfare (or, when taken to a further extreme of an absolute
demonisation and dehumanisation of the other, by mass killing, \'ethnic
cleansing\' or genocide). However anathema to a classical realist like
Morgenthau, for whom prudence was a core political virtue, these have
been influential ways of defining national security and defence during
the twentieth century and persists into the twenty-first. They infused
Cold War strategy in the United States (with the key policy document
NSC68 stating that \'the Soviet-led assault on free institutions is
worldwide now, and \... a defeat of free institutions anywhere is a
defeat everywhere\')40 and frames dominant Western responses to the
threat posed by Al Qaeda and like groups (as Tony Blair admitted in
2006, \'We could have chosen security as the battleground. But we
didn\'t. We chose values.\')41 It has also become influential, in a
particularly tragic and destructive way, in Israel, where memories of
the Holocaust and (all too common) statements by Muslim and Arab leaders
rejecting Israel\'s existence are mobilised by conservatives to justify
military adventurism and a rejectionist policy towards the Palestinians.
On the reverse side of such ontologies of national insecurity we find
pride and hubris, the belief that martial preparedness and action are
vital or healthy for the existence of a people. Clausewitz\'s thought is
thoroughly imbued with this conviction. For example, his definition of
war as an act of policy does not refer merely to the policy of cabinets,
but expresses the objectives and will of peoples: When whole communities
go to war \-- whole peoples, and especially civilized peoples \-- the
reason always lies in some political situation and the occasion is
always due to some political object. War, therefore, is an act of
policy.42 Such a perspective prefigures Schmitt\'s definition of the
\'political\' (an earlier translation reads \'war, therefore, is a
political act\'), and thus creates an inherent tension between its
tendency to fuel the escalation of conflict and Clausewitz\'s declared
aim, in defining war as policy, to prevent war becoming \'a complete,
untrammelled, absolute manifestation of violence\'.43 Likewise his
argument that war is a \'trinity\' of people (the source of \'primordial
violence, hatred and enmity\'), the military (who manage the \'play of
chance and probability\') and government (which achieve war\'s
\'subordination as an instrument of policy, which makes it subject to
reason alone\') merges the existential and rationalistic conceptions of
war into a theoretical unity.44 The idea that national identities could
be built and redeemed through war derived from the \'romantic
counter-revolution\' in philosophy which opposed the cosmopolitanism of
Kant with an emphasis on the absolute state \-- as expressed by Hegel\'s
Philosophy of Right, Bismarkian Realpolitik and politicians like Wilhelm
Von Humbolt. Humbolt, a Prussian minister of Education, wrote that war
\'is one of the most wholesome manifestations that plays a role in the
education of the human race\', and urged the formation of a national
army \'to inspire the citizen with the spirit of true war\'. He stated
that war \'alone gives the total structure the strength and the
diversity without which facility would be weakness and unity would be
void\'.45 In the Phenomenology of Mind Hegel made similar arguments that
to for individuals to find their essence \'Government has from time to
time to shake them to the very centre by war\'.46 The historian Azar Gat
points to the similarity of Clausewitz\'s arguments that \'a people and
a nation can hope for a strong position in the world only if national
character and familiarity with war fortify each other by continual
interaction\' to Hegel\'s vision of the ethical good of war in his
Philosophy of Right.47 Likewise Michael Shapiro sees Clausewitz and
Hegel as alike in seeing war \'as an ontological investment in both
individual and national completion\...Clausewitz figures war as
passionate ontological commitment rather than cool political
reason\...war is a major aspect of being.\'48 Hegel\'s text argues that
war is \'a work of freedom\' in which \'the individual\'s substantive
duty\' merges with the \'independence and sovereignty of the state\'.49
Through war, he argues, the ethical health of peoples is preserved in
their indifference to the stabilization of finite institutions; just as
the blowing of the winds preserves the sea from the foulness which would
be the result of a prolonged calm, so the corruption in nations would be
the product of a prolonged, let alone \'perpetual\' peace.50 Hegel
indeed argues that \'sacrifice on behalf of the individuality of the
state is a substantial tie between the state and all its members and so
is a universal duty\...if the state as such, if its autonomy, is in
jeopardy, all its citizens are duty bound to answer the summons to its
defence\'.51 Furthermore, this is not simply a duty, but a form of
self-realisation in which the individual dissolves into the higher unity
of the state: The intrinsic worth of courage as a disposition of mind is
to be found in the genuine, absolute, final end, the sovereignty of the
state. The work of courage is to actualise this end, and the means to
this end is the sacrifice of personal actuality. This form of experience
thus contains the harshness of extreme contradictions: a self-sacrifice
which yet is the real existence of one\'s freedom; the maximum
self-subsistence of individuality, yet only a cog playing its part in
the mechanism of an external organisation; absolute obedience,
renunciation of personal opinions and reasonings, in fact complete
absence of mind, coupled with the most intense and comprehensive
presence of mind and decision in the moment of acting; the most hostile
and so most personal action against individuals, coupled with an
attitude of complete indifference or even liking towards them as
individuals.52 A more frank statement of the potentially lethal
consequences of patriotism \-- and its simultaneously physical and
conceptual annihilation of the individual human being \-- is rarely to
be found, one that is repeated today in countless national discourses
and the strategic world-view in general. (In contrast, one of Kant\'s
fundamental objections to war was that it involved using men \'as mere
machines or instruments\'.53) Yet however bizarre and contradictory
Hegel\'s argument, it constitutes a powerful social ontology: an
apparently irrefutable discourse of being. It actualises the convergence
of war and the social contract in the form of the national security
state. Strategic Reason and Scientific Truth By itself, such an account
of the nationalist ontology of war and security provides only a general
insight into the perseverance of military violence as a core element of
politics. It does not explain why so many policymakers think military
violence works. As I argued earlier, such an ontology is married to a
more rationalistic form of strategic thought that claims to link violent
means to political ends predictably and controllably, and which, by
doing so, combines military action and national purposes into a common
\-- and thoroughly modern \-- horizon of certainty. Given Hegel\'s
desire to decisively distil and control the dynamic potentials of
modernity in thought, it is helpful to focus on the modernity of this
ontology \-- one that is modern in its adherence to modern scientific
models of truth, reality and technological progress, and in its
insistence on imposing images of scientific truth from the physical
sciences (such as mathematics and physics) onto human behaviour,
politics and society. For example, the military theorist and historian
Martin van Creveld has argued that one of the reasons Clausewitz was so
influential was that his \'ideas seemed to have chimed in with the
rationalistic, scientific, and technological outlook associated with the
industrial revolution\'.54 Set into this epistemological matrix, modern
politics and government engages in a sweeping project of mastery and
control in which all of the world\'s resources \-- mineral, animal,
physical, human \-- are made part of a machinic process of which war and
violence are viewed as normal features. These are the deeper claims and
implications of Clausewitzian strategic reason. One of the most
revealing contemporary examples comes from the writings (and actions) of
Henry Kissinger, a Harvard professor and later U.S. National Security
Adviser and Secretary of State. He wrote during the Vietnam war that
after 1945 U.S. foreign policy was based \'on the assumption that
technology plus managerial skills gave us the ability to reshape the
international system and to bring about domestic transformations in
emerging countries\'. This \'scientific revolution\' had \'for all
practical purposes, removed technical limits from the exercise of power
in foreign policy\'.55 Kissinger\'s conviction was based not merely in
his pride in the vast military and bureaucratic apparatus of the United
States, but in a particular epistemology (theory of knowledge).
Kissinger asserted that the West is \'deeply committed to the notion
that the real world is external to the observer, that knowledge consists
of recording and classifying data \-- the more accurately the better\'.
This, he claimed, has since the Renaissance set the West apart from an
\'undeveloped\' world that contains \'cultures that have escaped the
early impact of Newtonian thinking\' and remain wedded to the
\'essentially pre-Newtonian view that the real world is almost entirely
internal to the observer\'.56 At the same time, Kissinger\'s hubris and
hunger for control was beset by a corrosive anxiety: that, in an era of
nuclear weapons proliferation and constant military modernisation, of
geopolitical stalemate in Vietnam, and the emergence and militancy of
new post-colonial states, order and mastery were harder to define and
impose. He worried over the way \'military bipolarity\' between the
superpowers had \'encouraged political multipolarity\', which \'does not
guarantee stability. Rigidity is diminished, but so is
manageability\...equilibrium is difficult to achieve among states widely
divergent in values, goals, expectations and previous experience\'
(emphasis added). He mourned that \'the greatest need of the
contemporary international system is an agreed concept of order\'.57
Here were the driving obsessions of the modern rational statesman based
around a hunger for stasis and certainty that would entrench U.S.
hegemony: For the two decades after 1945, our international activities
were based on the assumption that technology plus managerial skills gave
us the ability to reshape the international system and to bring about
domestic transformations in \"emerging countries\". This direct
\"operational\" concept of international order has proved too simple.
Political multipolarity makes it impossible to impose an American
design. Our deepest challenge will be to evoke the creativity of a
pluralistic world, to base order on political multipolarity even though
overwhelming military strength will remain with the two superpowers.58
Kissinger\'s statement revealed that such cravings for order and
certainty continually confront chaos, resistance and uncertainty: clay
that won\'t be worked, flesh that will not yield, enemies that refuse to
surrender. This is one of the most powerful lessons of the Indochina
wars, which were to continue in a phenomenally destructive fashion for
six years after Kissinger wrote these words. Yet as his sinister,
Orwellian exhortation to \'evoke the creativity of a pluralistic world\'
demonstrated, Kissinger\'s hubris was undiminished. This is
[a]{.underline} vicious, [historic irony: a **desire** to **control**
nature, technology, society and human beings that is **continually
frustrated**, but **never** abandoned or **rethought**]{.underline}. By
1968 U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the rationalist
policymaker par excellence, had already decided that U.S. power and
technology could not prevail in Vietnam; Nixon and Kissinger\'s refusal
to accept this conclusion, to abandon their Cartesian illusions, was to
condemn hundreds of thousands more to die in Indochina and the people of
Cambodia to two more decades of horror and misery.59 In 2003 there would
be a powerful sense of déja vu as another Republican Administration
crowned more than decade of failed and destructive policy on Iraq with a
deeply controversial and divisive war to remove Saddam Hussein from
power. [In this struggle with the lessons of]{.underline} Vietnam,
[revolutionary resistance, and rapid geopolitical transformation, we are
witness to an **enduring** political and **cultural theme**: of a
**craving for order**, **control** and **certainty** in the face of
**continual uncertainty**]{.underline}. Closely related to this anxiety
was the way that Kissinger\'s thinking \-- and that of McNamara and
earlier imperialists like the British Governor of Egypt Cromer \-- was
embedded in instrumental images of technology and the machine: the
machine as both a tool of power and an image of social and political
order. In his essay \'The Government of Subject Races\' Cromer envisaged
effective imperial rule \-- over numerous societies and billions of
human beings \-- as best achieved by a central authority working \'to
ensure the harmonious working of the different parts of the machine\'.60
Kissinger analogously invoked the virtues of \'equilibrium\',
\'manageability\' and \'stability\' yet, writing some six decades later,
was anxious that technological progress no longer brought untroubled
control: the Westernising \'spread of technology and its associated
rationality\...does not inevitably produce a similar concept of
reality\'.61 We sense the rational policymaker\'s frustrated desire: the
world is supposed to work like a machine, ordered by a form of power and
governmental reason which deploys machines and whose desires and
processes are meant to run along ordered, rational lines like a machine.
Kissinger\'s desire was little different from that of Cromer who, wrote
Edward Said: \...envisions a seat of power in the West and radiating out
from it towards the East a great embracing machine, sustaining the
central authority yet commanded by it. What the machine\'s branches feed
into it from the East \-- human material, material wealth, knowledge,
what have you \-- is processed by the machine, then converted into more
power\...the immediate translation of mere Oriental matter into useful
substance.62 This desire for order in the shadow of chaos and
uncertainty \-- the constant war with an intractable and volatile matter
\-- has deep roots in modern thought, and was a major impetus to the
development of technological reason and its supporting theories of
knowledge. As Kissinger\'s claims about the West\'s Newtonian desire for
the \'accurate\' gathering and classification of \'data\' suggest,
modern strategy, foreign policy and Realpolitik have been thrust deep
into the apparently stable soil of natural science, in the hope of
finding immovable and unchallengeable roots there. While this process
has origins in ancient Judaic and Greek thought, it crystallised in
philosophical terms most powerfully during and after the Renaissance.
The key figures in this process were Francis Bacon, Galileo, Isaac
Newton, and René Descartes, who all combined a hunger for political and
ontological certainty, a positivist epistemology and a naïve faith in
the goodness of invention. Bacon sought to create certainty and order,
and with it a new human power over the world, through a new empirical
methodology based on a harmonious combination of experiment, the senses
and the understanding. With this method, he argued, we can \'derive hope
from a purer alliance of the faculties (the experimental and rational)
than has yet been attempted\'.63 In a similar move, Descartes sought to
conjure certainty from uncertainty through the application of a new
method that moved progressively out from a few basic certainties (the
existence of God, the certitude of individual consciousness and a
divinely granted faculty of judgement) in a search for pure fixed
truths. Mathematics formed the ideal image of this method, with its
strict logical reasoning, its quantifiable results and its uncanny
insights into the hidden structure of the cosmos.64 Earlier, Galileo had
argued that scientists should privilege \'objective\', quantifiable
qualities over \'merely perceptible\' ones; that \'only by means of an
exclusively quantitative analysis could science attain certain knowledge
of the world\'.65 Such doctrines of mathematically verifiable truth were
to have powerful echoes in the 20th Century, in the ascendancy of
systems analysis, game theory, cybernetics and computing in defense
policy and strategic decisions, and in the awesome scientific
breakthroughs of nuclear physics, which unlocked the innermost secrets
of matter and energy and applied the most advanced applications of
mathematics and computing to create the atomic bomb. Yet this new
scientific power was marked by a terrible irony: as even Morgenthau
understood, the control over matter afforded by the science could never
be translated into the control of the weapons themselves, into political
utility and rational strategy.66 Bacon thought of the new scientific
method not merely as way of achieving a purer access to truth and
epistemological certainty, but as liberating a new power that would
enable the creation of a new kind of Man. He opened the Novum Organum
with the statement that \'knowledge and human power are synonymous\',
and later wrote of his \'determination\...to lay a firmer foundation,
and extend to a greater distance the boundaries of human power and
dignity\'.67 In a revealing and highly negative comparison between
\'men\'s lives in the most polished countries of Europe and in any wild
and barbarous region of the new Indies\' \-- one that echoes in advance
Kissinger\'s distinction between post-and pre-Newtonian cultures \--
Bacon set out what was at stake in the advancement of empirical science:
anyone making this comparison, he remarked, \'will think it so great,
that man may be said to be a god unto man\'.68 We may be forgiven for
blinking, but in Bacon\'s thought \'man\' was indeed in the process of
stealing a new fire from the heavens and seizing God\'s power over the
world for itself. Not only would the new empirical science lead to \'an
improvement of mankind\'s estate, and an increase in their power over
nature\', but would reverse the primordial humiliation of the Fall of
Adam: For man, by the fall, lost at once his state of innocence, and his
empire over creation, both of which can be partially recovered even in
this life, the first by religion and faith, the second by the arts and
sciences. For creation did not become entirely and utterly rebellious by
the curse, but in consequence of the Divine decree, \'in the sweat of
thy brow thou shalt eat bread\'; she is now compelled by our labours
(not assuredly by our disputes or magical ceremonies) at length to
afford mankind in some degree his bread\...69 There is a breathtaking,
world-creating hubris in this statement \-- one that, in many ways, came
to characterise western modernity itself, and which is easily
recognisable in a generation of modern technocrats like Kissinger. The
Fall of Adam was the Judeo-Christian West\'s primal creation myth, one
that marked humankind as flawed and humbled before God, condemned to
hardship and ambivalence. Bacon forecast here a return to Eden, but one
of man\'s own making. This truly was the death of God, of putting man
into God\'s place, and no pious appeals to the continuity or guidance of
faith could disguise the awesome epistemological violence which now
subordinated creation to man. Bacon indeed argued that inventions are
\'new creations and imitations of divine works\'. As such, there is
nothing but good in science: \'the introduction of great inventions is
the most distinguished of human actions\...inventions are a blessing and
a benefit without injuring or afflicting any\'.70 And what would be
mankind\'s \'bread\', the rewards of its new \'**[empire]{.underline}**
over creation\'? If the new method and invention brought modern
medicine, social welfare, sanitation, communications, education and
comfort, it also [enabled]{.underline} the Armenian
**[genocide]{.underline}**, the Holocaust and [**two world wars**;
**napalm**, **the B52**, the **hydrogen bomb**]{.underline}, the
Kalashnikov rifle [and **military strategy**]{.underline}. Indeed some
of the 20th Century\'s most far-reaching inventions \-- radar,
television, rocketry, computing, communications, jet aircraft, the
Internet \-- would be the product of drives for national security and
militarisation. Even the inventions Bacon thought so marvellous and
transformative \-- printing, gunpowder and the compass \-- brought in
their wake upheaval and tragedy: printing, dogma and bureaucracy;
gunpowder, the rifle and the artillery battery; navigation, slavery and
the genocide of indigenous peoples. In short, the legacy of the new
empirical science would be ambivalence as much as certainty; degradation
as much as enlightenment; the destruction of nature as much as its
utilisation. Doubts and Fears: Technology as Ontology If Bacon could not
reasonably be expected to foresee many of these developments, the idea
that scientific and technological progress could be destructive did
occur to him. However it was an anxiety he summarily dismissed: \...let
none be alarmed at the objection of the arts and sciences becoming
depraved to malevolent or luxurious purposes and the like, for the same
can be said of every worldly good; talent, courage, strength, beauty,
riches, light itself\...Only let mankind regain their rights over
nature, assigned to them by the gift of God, and obtain that power,
whose exercise will be governed by right reason and true religion.71 By
the mid-Twentieth Century, after the destruction of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, such fears could no longer be so easily wished away, as the
physicist and scientific director of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert
Oppenheimer recognised. He said in a 1947 lecture: We felt a
particularly intimate responsibility for suggesting, for supporting and
in the end in large measure achieving the realization of atomic
weapons\...In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no
over-statement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin, and
this is a knowledge they cannot lose.72 Adam had fallen once more, but
into a world which refused to acknowledge its renewed intimacy with
contingency and evil. Man\'s empire over creation \-- his discovery of
the innermost secrets of matter and energy, of the fires that fuelled
the stars \-- had not \'enhanced human power and dignity\' as Bacon
claimed, but instead brought destruction and horror. [**Scientific
powers** that had been consciously applied in the defence of life and in
the hope of its betterment now **threaten**ed its total and **absolute
destruction**]{.underline}. This would not prevent a legion of
scientists, soldiers and national security policymakers later attempting
to apply Bacon\'s faith in invention and Descartes\' faith in
mathematics to make of the Bomb a rational weapon. Oppenheimer \-- who
resolutely opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb \-- understood
what the strategists could not: that the weapons resisted control,
resisted utility, that \'with the release of atomic energy quite
revolutionary changes had occurred in the techniques of warfare\'.73 Yet
Bacon\'s legacy, one deeply imprinted on the strategists, was his view
that truth and utility are \'perfectly identical\'.74 In 1947
Oppenheimer had clung to the hope that \'knowledge is good\...it seems
hard to live any other way than thinking it was better to know something
than not to know it; and the more you know, the better\'; by 1960 he
felt that \'terror attaches to new knowledge. It has an unmooring
quality; it finds men unprepared to deal with it.\'75 Martin Heidegger
questioned this mapping of natural science onto the social world in his
essays on technology \-- which, as \'machine\', has been so crucial to
modern strategic and geopolitical thought as an image of perfect
function and order and a powerful tool of intervention. He commented
that, given that modern technology \'employs exact physical
science\...the deceptive illusion arises that modern technology is
applied physical science\'.76 Yet as the essays and speeches of
Oppenheimer attest, technology and its relation to science, society and
war cannot be reduced to a noiseless series of translations of science
for politics, knowledge for force, or force for good. Instead,
Oppenheimer saw a process frustrated by roadblocks and ruptured by
irony; in his view there was no smooth, unproblematic translation of
scientific truth into social truth, and technology was not its vehicle.
Rather his comments raise profound and painful ethical questions that
resonate with terror and uncertainty. Yet this has not prevented
technology becoming a potent object of desire, not merely as an
instrument of power but as a promise and conduit of certainty itself. In
the minds of too many rational soldiers, strategists and policymakers,
technology brings with it the truth of its enabling science and spreads
it over the world. It turns epistemological certainty into political
certainty; it turns control over \'facts\' into control over the earth.
Heidegger\'s insights into this phenomena I find especially telling and
disturbing \-- because they underline the ontological force of the
instrumental view of politics. In The Question Concerning Technology,
Heidegger\'s striking argument was that in the modernising West
technology is not merely a tool, a \'means to an end\'. Rather
[**technology** has become a **governing image** of the modern universe,
one that has come to order, limit and **define** human existence as a
**\'calculable** coherence of **forces\'** and a **\'standing
reserve\'** of energy]{.underline}. Heidegger wrote: \'the threat to man
does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines
and apparatus of technology. [The actual threat has **already
affected**]{.underline} man in his **[essence]{.underline}**.\'77 This
process Heidegger calls \'Enframing\' and through it the scientific mind
demands that \'nature reports itself in some way or other that is
identifiable through calculation and remains orderable as a system of
information\'. Man is not a being who makes and uses machines as means,
choosing and limiting their impact on the world for his ends; rather man
has imagined the world as a machine and [humanity everywhere becomes
**trapped within its logic**]{.underline}. Man, he writes, \'comes to
the very brink of a precipitous fall\...where he himself will have to be
taken as standing-reserve. Meanwhile Man, precisely as the one so
threatened, exalts himself to the posture of lord of the earth.\'78
Technological man not only becomes the name for a project of lordship
and mastery over the earth, but incorporates humanity within this
project as a calculable resource. In strategy, [**warfare** and
**geopolitics human bodies**, actions and aspirations are caught,
transformed and perverted by such calculating, enframing reason: human
**lives** are **reduced to tools**]{.underline}, obstacles, useful [or
**obstinate matter**]{.underline}. This tells us much about the enduring
power of crude instrumental versions of strategic thought, which relate
not merely to the actual use of force but to broader geopolitical
strategies that see, as limited war theorists like Robert Osgood did,
force as an \'instrument of policy short of war\'. It was from within
this strategic ontology that figures like the Nobel prize-winning
economist Thomas Schelling theorised the strategic role of threats and
coercive diplomacy, and spoke of strategy as \'the power to hurt\'.79 In
the 2006 Lebanon war we can see such thinking in the remark of a U.S.
analyst, a former Ambassador to Israel and Syria, who speculated that by
targeting civilians and infrastructure Israel aimed \'to create enough
pain on the ground so there would be a local political reaction to
Hezbollah\'s adventurism\'.80 Similarly a retired Israeli army colonel
told the Washington Post that \'Israel is attempting to create a rift
between the Lebanese population and Hezbollah supporters by exacting a
heavy price from the elite in Beirut. The message is: If you want your
air conditioning to work and if you want to be able to fly to Paris for
shopping, you must pull your head out of the sand and take action toward
shutting down Hezbollah-land.\'81 Conclusion: Violent Ontologies or
Peaceful Choices? I was motivated to begin the larger project from which
this essay derives by a number of concerns. I felt that the available
critical, interpretive or performative languages of war \-- realist and
liberal international relations theories, just war theories, and various
Clausewitzian derivations of strategy \-- failed us, because they either
perform or refuse to place under suspicion the underlying political
ontologies that I have sought to unmask and question here. Many realists
have quite nuanced and critical attitudes to the use of force, but
ultimately affirm strategic thought and remain embedded within the
existential framework of the nation-state. Both liberal internationalist
and just war doctrines seek mainly to improve the accountability of
decision-making in security affairs and to limit some of the worst moral
enormities of war, but (apart from the more radical versions of
cosmopolitanism) they fail to question the ontological claims of
political community or strategic theory.82 In the case of a theorist
like Jean Bethke Elshtain, just war doctrine is in fact allied to a
softer, liberalised form of the Hegelian-Schmittian ontology. She
dismisses Kant\'s Perpetual Peace as \'a fantasy of at-oneness\...a
world in which differences have all been rubbed off\' and in which
\'politics, which is the way human beings have devised for dealing with
their differences, gets eliminated.\'83 She remains a committed liberal
democrat and espouses a moral community that stretches beyond the
nation-state, which strongly contrasts with Schmitt\'s hostility to
liberalism and his claustrophobic distinction between friend and enemy.
However her image of politics \-- which at its limits, she implies,
requires the resort to war as the only existentially satisfying way of
resolving deep-seated conflicts \-- reflects much of Schmitt\'s idea of
the political and Hegel\'s ontology of a fundamentally alienated world
of nation-states, in which war is a performance of being. She
categorically states that any effort to dismantle security dilemmas
\'also requires the dismantling of human beings as we know them\'.84
Whilst this would not be true of all just war advocates, I suspect that
even as they are so concerned with the ought, moral theories of violence
grant too much unquestioned power to the is. The problem here lies with
the confidence in being \-- of \'human beings as we know them\' \--
which ultimately fails to escape a Schmittian architecture and thus
eternally exacerbates (indeed reifies) antagonisms. Yet we know from the
work of Deleuze and especially William Connolly that [exchanging an
ontology of being for one of **becoming**, where the boundaries and
nature of the self contain new possibilities through agonistic relation
to others, provides a **less destructive** and violent way of
acknowledging and **dealing with** conflict and
**difference**]{.underline}.85 My argument here, whilst normatively
sympathetic to Kant\'s moral demand for the eventual abolition of war,
militates against excessive optimism.86 Even as I am arguing that [war
is not an **enduring** historical or anthropological feature, or a
neutral and rational instrument of policy \-- that it is **rather** the
**product** of **hegemonic** forms of **knowledge**]{.underline} about
political action and community \-- my analysis does suggest some
sobering conclusions about its power as an idea and formation. Neither
the progressive flow of history nor the pacific tendencies of an
international society of republican states will save us. The violent
ontologies I have described here in fact dominate the conceptual and
policy frameworks of modern republican states and have come, against
everything Kant hoped for, to stand in for progress, modernity and
reason. Indeed what Heidegger argues, I think with some credibility, is
that the enframing world view has come to stand in for being itself.
Enframing, argues Heidegger, \'does not simply endanger man in his
relationship to himself and to everything that is\...it drives out every
other possibility of revealing\...the rule of Enframing threatens man
with the possibility that it could be denied to him to enter into a more
original revealing and hence to experience the call of a more primal
truth.\'87 What I take from Heidegger\'s argument \-- one that I have
sought to extend by analysing the militaristic power of modern
ontologies of political existence and security \-- is a view that the
challenge is posed not merely by a few varieties of weapon, government,
technology or policy, but by an overarching system of thinking and
understanding that lays claim to our entire space of truth and
existence. Many of the most destructive features of contemporary
modernity \-- [**militarism**, **repression**, **coercive diplomacy**,
**covert intervention**, **geopolitics**, **economic exploitation** and
**ecological destruction** \-- derive not merely from particular
**choices** by policymakers]{.underline} based on their particular
interests, [but from **calculative**, \'empirical\' **discourses** of
scientific and political truth **rooted** in powerful enlightenment
**images** of **being**. Confined within such an epistemological and
cultural universe]{.underline}, policymakers\' choices become
necessities, their actions become inevitabilities, and [humans
**suffer** and **die**]{.underline}. Viewed in this light,
\'rationality\' is the name we give the chain of reasoning which builds
one structure of truth on another until a course of action, however
violent or dangerous, becomes preordained through that reasoning\'s very
operation and existence. It creates both discursive constraints \--
available choices may simply not be seen as credible or legitimate \--
and material constraints that derive from the mutually reinforcing
cascade of discourses and events which then preordain militarism and
violence as necessary policy responses, however ineffective,
dysfunctional or chaotic. The force of my own and Heidegger\'s analysis
does, admittedly, tend towards a deterministic fatalism. On my part this
is quite deliberate; it is important to allow this possible conclusion
to weigh on us. Large sections of modern societies \-- especially parts
of the media, political leaderships and national security institutions
\-- are utterly trapped within the Clausewitzian paradigm, within the
instrumental utilitarianism of \'enframing\' and the stark ontology of
the friend and enemy. They are certainly tremendously aggressive and
energetic in continually stating and reinstating its force. But is there
a way out? Is there no possibility of agency and choice? Is this not the
key normative problem I raised at the outset, of how the modern
ontologies of war efface agency, causality and responsibility from
decision making; the responsibility that comes with having choices and
making decisions, with exercising power? (In this I am much closer to
Connolly than Foucault, in Connolly\'s insistence that, even in the face
of the anonymous power of discourse to produce and limit subjects,
selves remain capable of agency and thus incur responsibilities.88)
There seems no point in following Heidegger in seeking a more \'primal
truth\' of being \-- that is to reinstate ontology and obscure its
worldly manifestations and consequences from critique. However we can,
while refusing Heidegger\'s unworldly89 nostalgia, appreciate that he
was searching for a way out of the modern system of calculation; that he
was searching for a \'questioning\', \'free relationship\' to technology
that would not be immediately recaptured by the strategic, calculating
vision of enframing. Yet his path out is somewhat chimerical \-- his
faith in \'art\' and the older Greek attitudes of \'responsibility and
indebtedness\' offer us valuable clues to the kind of sensibility
needed, but little more. When we consider the problem of policy, the
force of this analysis suggests that choice and agency can be all too
often limited; they can remain confined (sometimes quite wilfully)
within the overarching strategic and security paradigms. Or, more
hopefully, **[policy choices]{.underline}** could aim to bring into
being a more enduringly inclusive, cosmopolitan and peaceful logic of
the political. But this [**cannot be done** without **seizing
alternatives** from **outside** the space of **enframing** and
**util**itarian **strategic thought**, by being aware of its presence
and weight and activating a very different concept of existence,
security and action]{.underline}.90 [This would seem to hinge upon
**\'questioning\'** as such \-- on the questions we put to the real and
our efforts to create and act into it.]{.underline} Do security and
strategic policies seek to exploit and direct humans as material, as
energy, or do they seek to protect and enlarge human dignity and
autonomy? Do they seek to impose by force an unjust status quo (as in
Palestine), or to remove one injustice only to replace it with others
(the U.S. in Iraq or Afghanistan), or do so at an unacceptable human,
economic, and environmental price? Do we see our actions within an
instrumental, amoral framework (of \'interests\') and a linear chain of
causes and effects (the idea of force), or do we see them as folding
into a complex interplay of languages, norms, events and consequences
which are less predictable and controllable?91 And most fundamentally:
Are we seeking to coerce or persuade? Are less violent and more
sustainable choices available? Will our actions perpetuate or help to
end the global rule of insecurity and violence? Will our thought?

Securitization and desecuritization ¶ The ceteris paribus normative
push, and political recommendation of the securitization approach has
been 'less security, more politics', and the development of 'possible
modalities' for [the desecuritization of politics]{.underline} (Wæver
1989a, 52): it [is]{.underline} generally (which can only be assessed in
practice though) [more conducive to treat identities as identities,
religion as religion, the environment as the environment, and so on, and
to engage]{.underline} their [politics through the particular modalities
and rationalities of those fields **rather than those of
security**]{.underline}. In the received reading, whilst securitization
raises issues into the realm of security policies and practices (arrow
2a in Figure 1), [desecuritization lowers issues back into the realm of
'regular politics' or removes issues from the political agenda
altogether]{.underline} (arrow 1 in Figure 1). ¶ [Desecuritization can
be achieved through a number of options: by simply **not talking about
issues in terms of security**, by keeping responses to securitized
issues in forms that **do not create security dilemmas**]{.underline}
[or other **vicious spirals**]{.underline}, [and by moving security
issues back into 'normal politics']{.underline} (Wæver 2000, 253). These
options can follow objectivist, constructivist or deconstructivist
strategies in bringing about desecuritization (Huysmans (1995, 65--67).
These strategies differ in regard to how the process relates to the
claimed threat: has the threat been dealt with, can the security drama
be somehow handled from without, or can identities beyond security
threats be produced from within the process. ¶ [Beyond conceptualizing
desecuritization as an option or a strategy, it has also been viewed
from the viewpoint of political actors]{.underline} (de Wilde 2008,
597), [and their political moves in games of contestation and
resistance]{.underline} (Vuori 2011a, 2015). [There can be
desecuritizing actors who **evade**, circumvent or **directly oppose
securitizing moves**]{.underline} by, for example, emphasizing competing
threats (de Wilde 2008, 597). Security policies aim at desecuritization
(the solution to the threatening situation), but desecuritization can
also happen independently from the actions of securitizing or
desecuritizing actors: the original security problem may be solved,
institutions may adapt through new reproductive structures, discourses
may change (e.g., with the loss of interest or audiences), and the
original referent object may be lost (de Wilde 2008). ¶ [A key issue of
debate has been on whether desecuritization can be considered to be an
active political process, or whether desecuritization can only happen as
a fading away of the issue]{.underline} (Behnke 2006, 65): the question
is whether the logic and possibility of securitization is necessarily
retained in explicit discussions of whether an issue has retained the
status of a security issue. [As empirical studies of securitization and
desecuritization dynamics]{.underline} (e.g., Salter and Mutlu 2013;
Lupovici 2014; Vuori 2015; Donnelly 2015) have shown, [it is difficult
to point to a definitive end point for either securitization or
desecuritization: political and social situations evolve]{.underline}.
Whichever the philosophical stance on how and whether desecuritization
can be achieved (Vuori 2011a), such [empirical studies show that
political actors do make **active desecuritization moves**]{.underline}.
¶ Indeed, systematizing empirical studies of desecuritization, Hansen
(2012, 529; 539--545) has identified four ideal type forms for the
concept. In regard to its issues of concern, namely the status of enmity
and the possibility of a public sphere, when a larger conflict is still
within the realm of possibility, but [when a particular issue is
presented with terms other than security, we have an instance of (1)
'change through **stabilisation**]{.underline}' (arrow 2b in Figure 1);
when another issue takes the place of a previously securitized issue,
[we have (2) 'replacement'; when the originally phrased **threat is
resolved**, we have]{.underline} (3) **[rearticulation]{.underline}**;
and finally[,]{.underline} when potentially insecure subjects are
marginalized through depoliticization, we have (4) 'silencing' (types
2--3 are represented by arrow 1 in Figure 1). ¶ The previous literature
on both securitization (arrow 2a in Figure 1) and desecuritization
(arrow 1 in Figure 1) has produced ample illustrations of both dynamics.
As a brief example of how both dynamics can alter between the same
political actors, we can use some of the vicissitudes of Sino-Soviet
relations. ¶ China entered the Cold War in the Soviet camp and relied on
the Soviet Union as the guarantee of the international security of the
new People's Republic. Chinese views in the late 1940s clearly
structured the world into two opposing camps, with China firmly in the
Soviet one (Mao 1949). In the 1950s, however, Sino-Soviet relations
soured, and the following 'Sino-Soviet split' (Lüthi 2008) has been used
as an example of the capacity of 'parochial' securitizations to become
disaffected by or even be withdrawn from dominant 'macrosecuritizations'
(Buzan and Wæver 2009, 257). ¶ Following the split, Sino-Soviet
relations in the 1960s were characterized by intensive ideological
conflict, and Mao Zedong securitized Soviet revisionism as a major
threat for the Chinese Communist Party (Vuori 2011b). Indeed, newly
available documents suggest that it was the Chinese side, in effect Mao
Zedong, which was more active in the pursuit of ideological conflict
(Lüthi 2008, 2). In his securitization of the Soviet Union, Mao linked
the revisionism he identified there to that which he also securitized
domestically (Vuori 2011b), and the issue of revisionism was presented
as an issue of life and death for the party. ¶ Sino-Soviet relations
began to mend in the 1980s with the removal of a number of political
obstacles and with the intensification of the conflict between the
United States and the Soviet Union (Wishnick 2001). Yet, it is only with
the fall of the Soviet Union that we can see an overall desecuritization
in the form of rearticulation (Hansen 2012, 542--544) taking place in
Sino-Russian relations. In the aftermath of the end of the Cold War,
China's line was not to take the lead in international affairs. China
worked towards 'world multipolarization', which was exemplified with
China and Russia forming a 'strategic partnership' in 1996. China and
Russia even shared the same 'threat package' of 'terrorism, separatism,
and religious extremism' (the 'three evils') within the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (Jackson 2006, 310). These are strong
indicators of how the two states have managed to reform their identities
away from the Sino-Soviet antagonism. In the overall state relations
then, we can see a rearticulative desecuritization tactic at play on
both sides: ever since the early 1980s, China's policy towards the
Soviet Union (and later Russia) shifted from antagonism to one of
collaboration and negotiation rather than securitization.¶
[Desecuritization can be conceptualized]{.underline} in the above manner
[as a **negative ontological corollary** to securitization]{.underline}.
Yet, [it is also prudent to investigate securitization and
desecuritization as political moves in order to potentially understand
the logic of when and how they are wielded in **practical
politics**]{.underline}. It is proposed here that in addition to
instances where a securitized situation is dismantled (arrow 1 in Figure
1), [desecuritization can also be viewed as a political move that can be
deployed before 'securitization plays' in a game]{.underline} of
securitization (arrow 2a in Figure 1). In other words, [desecuritization
moves]{.underline} -- [both in terms of **discourse** and
**practice**]{.underline} -- [can be used in a pre-emptive manner before
the threshold of securitization is reached]{.underline} (arrow 2b in
Figure 1). For Wæver (2000, 254), silencing can be a strategy to
'pre-empt or forestall securitization'. We argue here that beyond
silencing, **[active desecuritization efforts can be made to block the
escalation of a contention]{.underline}**. Thereby, in addition to
change through stabilization (Hansen 2012) and the silencing of an issue
(Wæver 2000), [**there can be explicit rebuttals of security frames and
claims before they are solidified into policy**. This tactic can be
termed 'pre-emptive desecuritization through rebuttal'.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Plan Consequences Key 

**Debate should be centered on the [consequences of the
plan]{.underline}---comparing [opportunity costs]{.underline} is best
for [clash]{.underline} and [argument refinement]{.underline}, which is
a [prerequisite]{.underline} to making critique and activism portable.**

**Fairclough and Fairclough, 18**---emeritus Professor of Linguistics at
Lancaster University AND School of Humanities and Social Sciences,
University of Central Lancashire (Norman and Isabela, "A procedural
approach to ethical critique in CDA," Critical Discourse Studies Volume
15, 2018 - Issue 2, 169-185) \[CDA=critical discourse analysis\]

The term 'discourse ethics' is Habermas's (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012:
30-34), but we are using it here in a general sense: for the view that
[an **adequate [framework for ethical evaluation]{.mark}** and
**critique [must include]{.mark} the comparison** and **evaluation of
different [arguments for]{.mark} different lines of [action]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}in a process of deliberation]{.underline}. Such assessments of
arguments pose difficult problems, and deliberation is by no means
guaranteed to produce consensus. Nevertheless, [[deliberation can
**contribute to** ]{.mark}**the quality of ethical [critique]{.mark}**
[by ensuring]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} **wide [range of arguments are
considered]{.mark}** in making decisions, that all alternatives are
**taken into account** and **thoroughly criticized**, and that people
have to (at least) **moderate their own partialities** in evaluating a
range of arguments collectively]{.underline}. To illustrate this, we
shall refer to two ethically contentious political decisions and the
courses of action which they led to. The first is the decision by the
British Prime Minister Tony Blair to advocate Britain's participation in
the invasion of Iraq in 2003 (we have discussed this in Fairclough &
Fairclough 2012: 96-97). The second is the decision by the German
Chancellor Angela Merkel to open Germany's borders to the refugees
coming from the Middle East in the autumn of 2015. In so doing, we will
illustrate the relevance of ethical critique from all three of the major
ethical positions: deontological, consequentialist and virtue ethics.
CDA and practical argumentation CDA is mainly concerned with [critical
analysis of discourse]{.underline} which [is **oriented to
action**]{.underline}, including political discourse, but also
managerial, organisational and other forms of discourse. [The **primary
activity** in such discourse is **practical
argumentation**]{.underline}, argumentation over action, [over **[what
is to be done]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. **[[what policies should be
adopted]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [Practical argumentation
should]{.underline} accordingly [be the **primary analytical
focus**]{.underline} in CDA (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012). [This
**[does not exclude other]{.mark}**]{.underline} familiar **[forms of
analysis]{.underline}** ([such as **[analysing
rep]{.mark}resentation[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}[) [but subsumes
them.]{.underline} ]{.mark}[The point of]{.underline} representing (or
['framing']{.underline}) [an issue in a particular way is to **create
particular**]{.underline} public [**attitudes** and **opinions**, and
thus **legitimize** or **facilitate a particular course of
action**.]{.underline} Critique of discourse is the focal concern for
CDA, but critique of discourse is by no means exclusive to CDA. On the
contrary, [critique of discourse]{.underline} is a normal part of all
discourse. It [is a **normal part of everyday practical argumentation**:
people **find reasons in favour** and **against proposals for action**,
they **consider alternatives**, **adopt them** or **discard them**, and
so on[. A course of action **worthy of being adopted** is **one that has
withstood criticism**]{.mark}. Agents may decide to discard proposals
either because they are **likely to be instrumentally inadequate** iun
relation to the goals they are supposed to achieve, or because they find
them **ethically problematic**]{.underline}, for example because the
values or goals they are motivated by are unacceptable. Ethical critique
is a concern for CDA at three levels: as an aspect of agents' reasoning,
for example as an aspect of politicians' deliberation over what policy
to adopt; as an aspect of the normative critique of those deliberative
practices which CDA carries out; as an aspect of the critique that CDA
itself is open to. There are therefore three main places where ethical
values come into the picture: what values are arguers (e.g. politicians)
arguing from? what are the values that CDA analysts are espousing, from
the perspective of which they are evaluating the arguments of those
arguers? what are the values of other critics (including critics of
CDA)? [CDA]{.underline} is itself a form of discourse, which is
specialized for academic critique of social actions, events, practices
and structures, with a focus on discourse. It [can itself be viewed as a
**form of practical argumentation**]{.underline} (Fairclough 2013),
[open to the **same critical questions** that it directs at the
discourse it subjects to critique]{.underline}. CDA practitioners are
bound by an obligation to address ethical evaluations that are critical
of their work. Moreover, [the ethical judgement which is part of the
normative critique carried out]{.underline} in CDA [**does not come out
of thin air**, but is built upon elements drawn selectively from ethical
judgement and critique in public discourse]{.underline}. And CDA needs
to rethink its own critique in response to shifts in public discourse
and political reality, such as the emergence of controversy over
'political correctness' (Fairclough 2003). We have argued that [[the
**primary focus** of critical analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} in CDA
[[should b]{.mark}e **practical argumentation** and
**deliberation**]{.underline} (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012). This was
based upon a claim about the character of political discourse, which we
saw as [primarily [concerned with ]{.mark}]{.underline}the question of
[**[what is to be done]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Deliberation is an
abstract genre in which **(alternative) proposals are being tested**.
The **framework**]{.underline} for critical analysis [of **practical
argumentation** and **deliberation**]{.underline} which we have
developed since 2012 [provides]{.underline} CDA with [an **effective way
of evaluating** and **critiquing discourse** from an **ethical point of
view**]{.underline}. One of its strengths is that [it allows **different
approaches** to thinking about ethical questions]{.underline}
(deontological, consequentialist and virtue ethics) [to be combined
within an **ethical deliberative procedure for achieving
impartiality**]{.underline}. In a more recent version of this framework
(Fairclough, I. 2016, 2018), [deliberation is modelled as a critical
procedure designed to **filter out**]{.underline} those **[practical
conclusions]{.underline}** (and corresponding decisions) [that **would
not pass the test of critical questioning**]{.underline}. Two distinct
argument schemes are involved in deliberative activity types: an
argument from goals, circumstances and meansgoal relations, and an
argument from (negative or positive) consequences. [[Proposals
are]{.mark} **tentatively supported** by **practical arguments from
goals**, and are **[tested in the light of their potential
consequences]{.mark}**, via **practical arguments from
consequence**]{.underline}. Goals are generated by various sources of
normativity, and these can be what conventionally is called 'values',
but can also be obligations, rights and duties. [Critical questioning
seeks to **expose potential negative consequences** of proposals and
thus evaluate them in terms of their **acceptability** or
**reasonableness**: if the consequences are **on balance unacceptable**
for those affected, then it would be **more reasonable not to engage in
the proposed course of action**. Unacceptable consequences are
**critical objections** which can **conclusively rebut a proposal**.
Where two or more proposals survive critical testing, one may be
**chosen as the better proposal** on nonarbitrary grounds]{.underline}
(e.g. being simpler to enact). In our view, [the **most significant
perspective** in the light of which proposals are to be tested is a
**consequentialist** one]{.underline} (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012,
Fairclough, I. 2016). The term 'consequence' is however used here
broadly to refer to several types of states-of-affairs: the goals of the
proposed action (the intended consequences); the potential unintended
consequences (or risks) involved; various known and predictable impacts,
including impacts on institutional, social facts. [If a proposal is
**likely to result in a situation** that is]{.underline} illegal or
[**unjust**, then the proposal can be **evaluated as unacceptable** from
both a **consequentialist ethics** and a **deontological ethical
position**. [Our framework can]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore
**[[accommodate]{.underline}]{.mark}** deontological [[**ethical
issues** within a]{.mark}]{.underline} broader **[[consequentialist
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By inquiring into the motives of
action, the framework can also accommodate a virtue-ethical perspective.

### 2AC -- Scenario Planning 

#### IR Scenario analysis unlocks an [intellectual openness]{.underline} to overcome [cognitive biases]{.underline} and incorporate [complementary theories]{.underline} while making research policy-relevant

analysis for international relations", Contemporary Security Policy,
Accessed through the Wake Forest Library\]

Added-**[value of [scenario analysis for IR
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order [to [**fill the gap**
between]{.mark} **IR [theory]{.mark}** [and **real**]{.mark}**-world
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, "an increasing number of
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} have come to [[embrace]{.mark} a spirit
of [**intellectual openness**, recognizing]{.mark} both the need for
[**greater flexibility** in]{.mark} the [**theoretical formulations**
and]{.mark} the [**possibility of complementarity** by **other
theories**]{.mark} and approaches"]{.underline} (p. 12).
[This]{.underline} section discusses the [added value of scenario
analysis as a **complementary approach** to **traditional IR
methods**.]{.underline} The [most obvious [advantage of **scenario
analysis**]{.mark} **as a methodology**]{.underline}, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, [[lies]{.underline}]{.mark} by
definition [[in its ability to **tackle future
events**.]{.underline}]{.mark} As mentioned before, [there are no
specified instruments within traditional IR methods which would allow
scholars to go beyond past and present.]{.underline} The only exception
is forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which is, however,
distinctly different from foresight.

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. Foresight, as described above, aims at going beyond
existing patterns by developing alternative futures based on an
innovative combination of multiple driving forces. Its goal is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from them by examining the
causal relations between driving forces and their different evolutions.
By applying scenario approaches, scholars can thus account for evolving
dynamics and discuss such timely issues as the consequences of Brexit
for both British and EU-security, economics and politics (Brakman,
Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018; Musolff, 2017;
Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, [scenario analysis offers
more than the possibility to talk about the future.]{.underline} We see
a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods
applied by IR scholars.

Confronting enduring assumptions

As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of
[explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this
paper, is to [**stimulate creative thinking** by **challenging** the
**deeply held assumptions of their authors**.]{.underline} In other
words, [[this method]{.mark} is helpful for **[overcom]{.mark}ing**
enduring **[cognitive biases]{.mark}**---mental errors [such as
**linearity**]{.mark}, **presentism**, [and **group think** caused by
the **subconscious**]{.mark} and **simplified information processing of
humans**]{.underline} (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111-- 112). [Humans have the
tendencies to focus on the present at the expense of the future and to
think about the future in linear terms by extrapolating past trends into
the future.]{.underline} As Gaddis (1992) points out, "we tend to bias
our historical and our theoretical analyses too much toward continuity
(...) [we rarely]{.underline} find a way to [introduce **discontinuities
into theory**]{.underline}, [or to attempt to determine what causes them
to happen]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if Gaddis does not explicitly
mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts underlying scenario
approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis attends to
"**deeper**, otherwise left **implicit**, **assumptions** about
**continuous** and **linear patterns of development**"]{.underline}
(Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The [**[process]{.mark} of scenario
development** [invites]{.mark} the [participants to **reveal** and
**question convictions** which]{.mark} have **so far [remained
unchallenged]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} to **[question]{.mark} the
[linearity of]{.mark} world
[developments]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [ability of **reexamining one's own assumptions** and going **beyond
linear patterns** of development is **essential** for **IR
scholarship**.]{.underline} To illustrate it with two examples: IR
scholars and historians did not think that the Soviet Union could
collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful resolution of the
Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system (Davis, 2005;
Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars were for
decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and cultural
limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden ascent and
were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson,
2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident, the United
States debate on its future has been marked by a similar linearity of
thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's long-term
future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved incapable of
anticipating events of such importance, because scholars took for
granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias towards
linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a result, two
major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and the rise of
China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to catch up.

Against this backdrop, [[foresight helps]{.mark} IR [scholars]{.mark} to
**[exit]{.mark}** the [**tunnel vision** on]{.mark} world
[affairs]{.mark} and discover potentially valuable nonlinear lines of
development. [These can be]{.mark} both [**innovative** in]{.mark} terms
of [**scholarship**, and **policy-relevant**]{.mark} by [offering a
**reflection**]{.mark} on **unexpected discontinuities**.]{.underline}
Thus, [it can facilitate the **intellectual capability** [to **think the
unthinkable**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Porter, 2016, p. 259).

Bringing forward new research questions

[Scenario analysis starts with **confronting one's enduring
assumptions** and **developing multiple causal possibilities**, through
which scholars can potentially discover topics that have not been
examined before. One of the greatest challenges for any scholar is to
identify innovative venues for research that might bring the discipline
forward]{.underline} and advance publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian
terms, such an ability is often considered an evidence of a progressive
research program.10 [Since the prime feature of scenario analysis is to
**detect rapid and significant shifts** in **trajectories**, or the
**forces behind them**, this method succors]{.underline} when defining
new pressing topics for academia. In particular, as mentioned in the
previous section, scenario analysis enables the detection of both weak
signals and wild cards. By drawing attention to these hitherto
overlooked but potentially pressing issues, [scenario analysis can
identify research agendas for **further investigation**]{.underline}
(Barma et al., 2016). Therefore, [scenario analysis seems to be the
right tool to **advance innovative research** since it helps scholars
**drive their research into new areas**, away from moribund topics that
have been followed for many decades.]{.underline} By "identifying
questions of likely future significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6),
scenario analysis can contribute to combatting the proliferation of
researchers in fields occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet
or Japan studies in the United States in the 1980s. At the same time,
[[innovative research]{.mark} topics **[confront]{.mark} the
[uncertainties]{.mark}** [that are **crucial for policymakers**
to]{.mark} be [monitor]{.mark}ed closely.]{.underline}

Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world issues

[Another added value of the scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in
its ability to provide **comprehensive causal reasoning** and thus to
**tackle complex issues**.]{.underline} As mentioned in the
introduction, [the **world's complexity** combined with **abrupt
shifts** poses a challenge for IR scholarship.]{.underline} The
[[possibility to **accommodate multiple driving forces**, to **take into
account different values**]{.mark} they might take [and]{.mark} finally
to **[combine them]{.mark} with each other** [and **see how they affect
the**]{.mark} **dependent [variable]{.mark}**, [makes]{.mark} the
[scenario approach]{.mark} quite [unique]{.mark}. Traditional IR methods
work with a limited number of independent variables]{.underline},
formulate and test hypotheses usually based on the relation between a
single causal variable and the dependent variable. Investigating complex
causal trajectories is therefore not possible. Against this background,
we agree with Barma et al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that
[**scenarios are highly apt** for **dealing with complexity** and
**uncertainty** and [providing]{.mark} academia with [a tool for
"**actionable clarity** in **understanding**]{.mark} **contemporary
global [issues]{.mark}**["]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 1).

Moreover, the scenario approach helps to tackle the challenges of
interdisciplinarity that is tied to complexity. By drawing on the active
participation of people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and
with different expertise in the scenario development process, it brings
interdisciplinarity to the table by default. The key advantage of the
approach is that this [interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior
to and during the research phase, rather than after it.]{.underline}
This distinguishes the scenario approach from other methods that bring
interdisciplinary perspectives together but do not facilitate a
discussion between them, rather letting them passively co-exist. By
exploring the dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change
(key drivers), [scenario analysis can be useful for shedding light on
developments that would have been overlooked by narrower research
designs. In **security studies**]{.underline}, for example, [scenario
analysis can **connect the dots** between hard, soft, traditional and
non-traditional understandings of security and capture the **interplay
of economic-societalenvironmental** and **technological changes**.
Imposing interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also [helps to **counter** the
"**hyper-fragmentation of knowledge**" that "makes it difficult for even
scholars in different disciplines to understand each other, much less
policy-makers and general public"]{.underline} (Desch, 2015, p. 381).

[Complex real-world issues]{.underline} that were [tackled using
scenario analysis include the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}
(Stein et al., 1998), [Turkey's geopolitical environment]{.underline}
(Çelik & Blum, 2007), the [prospects of the United States-- China
conflict]{.underline} (Friedberg, 2005) [and the consequences of Brexit
for EU foreign and security policy]{.underline} (Martill & Sus, 2018).
An examination of these topics without the application of
interdisciplinary approaches would not be possible precisely due to
their multifaceted character.

Stepping out of the ivory tower

Finally, [scenario analysis]{.underline} also [enables **IR scholars**
to **establish** a **channel of communication with
policy-makers**]{.underline} other than conducting interviews for their
own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. [A participatory
scenario process forges "**deep and shared understanding** between its
participants"]{.underline} (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, [academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures.]{.underline}
Hence, [[scenario analysis can be]{.mark} perceived as [a tool towards
**more exchange between academia and policy-making** that]{.mark} can
[contribute to a **better understanding between the two**]{.mark}
worlds. For policymakers, it provides the opportunity [to consider
**long-term trends**]{.mark}]{.underline} (an occasion not often found
in the day-to-day nature of politics). [For academics, it provides
insight into which trends are most concerning for policy-makers,
allowing them to check [and]{.mark} ultimately [enhance]{.mark} the
**[relevance of]{.mark} their [research
agendas]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We acknowledge the difficulty to engage policy-makers in foresight
exercises caused by their time-constrains and possible lack of interest.
Yet, in our experience, this problem mostly refers to high-level
policy-makers. Mid-level and former officials and policy-makers have
more time and willingness to participate in foresight exercises and
contribute equally valuable perspectives. The participatory character of
foresight exercises facilitates the exchange of views from different
stakeholders on an equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has
shown, it has proven to be stimulating for each of the engaged groups.

Moreover, the [**policy dialogue** benefits from **scenarios'
accessibility** to a **broader audience**. Scenario publications tend to
be shorter and easier to read than the average academic
publication]{.underline} and as Nye (2008) rightly notes "a premium on
time is a major difference between the two cultures" of academia and
policy-making. Since [scenario publications are **more suitable** to the
**time- and attention-constraints** of many policy-makers, they improve
the accessibility of research findings for the policy world]{.underline}
(Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An illustrative example is offered by a
foresight exercise conducted by the Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A
group of academics, think tank experts and policy-makers developed
scenarios on the future of the liberal world order that served as raw
material for a newspaper from the future titled "The Aspen Insight" and
dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the presentation of the newspaper
catch the attention of many Berlin-based policy-makers but the "The
Aspen Insight" was also attached as a supplement to the Berlin daily
Tagesspiegel, and reached more than 300,000 readers.11

We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added value of [scenario
analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline} are interrelated and that their
boundaries are not clear-cut. Yet, we believe, they [highlight distinct
benefits]{.underline} of this approach [for academics that want to
**tackle the challenges of today's world via their
research**.]{.underline}

#### Scenario analysis is pedagogically valuable -- enhances creativity and self-reflexivity, deconstructs cognitive biases and flawed ontological assumptions, and enables the imagination and creation of alternative futures.

[Over the past decade, [the "cult of irrelevance"]{.mark} in political
science]{.underline} scholarship [[has been lamented by a growing
chorus]{.underline}]{.mark} (Putnam 2003; Nye 2009; Walt 2009).
[[Prominent scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} of international affairs
[[have diagnosed]{.underline}]{.mark} the roots of [[the
gap]{.underline}]{.mark} between academia and policymaking, [[made the
case for why]{.underline}]{.mark} political science [[research is
valuable for policymaking]{.underline}, [and
offered]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of [ideas]{.underline} for
enhancing the policy relevance of scholarship in international relations
and comparative politics (Walt 2005,2011; Mead 2010; Van Evera 2010;
Jentleson and Ratner 2011; Gallucci 2012; Avey and Desch 2014). Building
on these insights, [[several initiatives]{.mark} have been
formed]{.underline} in the attempt to "bridge the gap."2
[Many]{.underline} of the specific efforts put in place by these
projects [focus on providing scholars with the skills, platforms, and
networks to better communicate]{.underline} the [findings and
implications]{.underline} of their research [to the policymaking
community]{.underline}, a necessary and worthwhile objective for a field
in which theoretical debates, methodological training, and publishing
norms tend more and more toward the abstract and esoteric.¶ [[Yet
enhancing communication]{.underline}]{.mark} between scholars and
policymakers [[is only one component]{.underline}]{.mark} of bridging
the gap between international affairs theory and practice.
[[Anothe]{.mark}r]{.underline} crucial component of this bridge [[is the
**generation of substantive research programs that are actually policy
relevant**]{.underline}]{.mark}---a challenge to which less concerted
attention has been paid. The dual challenges of bridging the gap are
especially acute for graduate students, a particular irony since many
enter the discipline with the explicit hope of informing policy. [In a
field that has an admirable devotion to pedagogical
self-reflection]{.underline}, [**[strikingly little attention is paid to
techniques for generating policy-relevant ideas]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[for]{.underline} dissertation and other [research topics]{.underline}.
Although numerous articles and conference workshops are devoted to the
importance of experiential and problem-based learning, especially
through techniques of simulation that emulate policymaking processes
(Loggins 2009; Butcher 2012; Glasgow 2012; Rothman 2012; DiCicco 2014),
little has been written about the use of such techniques for generating
and developing innovative research ideas.¶ [This article outlines an
experiential and problem-based approach to]{.underline} developing a
[political science research]{.underline} program [using scenario
analysis]{.underline}. It focuses especially on illuminating the
research generation and pedagogical benefits of this technique by
describing the use of scenarios in the annual New Era Foreign Policy
Conference (NEFPC), which brings together doctoral students of
international and comparative affairs who share a demonstrated interest
in policy-relevant scholarship.3 In the introductory section, the
article outlines the practice of scenario analysis and considers the
utility of the technique in political science. We argue that scenario
analysis should be viewed as a tool to stimulate problem-based learning
for doctoral students and discuss the broader scholarly benefits of
using scenarios to help generate research ideas. The second section
details the manner in which NEFPC deploys scenario analysis. The third
section reflects upon some of the concrete scholarly benefits that have
been realized from the scenario format. The fourth section offers
insights on the pedagogical potential associated with using scenarios in
the classroom across levels of study. A brief conclusion reflects on the
importance of developing specific techniques to aid those who wish to
generate political science scholarship of relevance to the policy
world.¶ What Are Scenarios and Why Use Them in Political Science?¶
[Scenario analysis]{.underline} is perceived most commonly as a
technique for examining the robustness of strategy. It [can immerse
decision makers in future states that go beyond conventional
extrapolations of current trends]{.underline}, [preparing them to take
advantage of unexpected opportunities and to protect themselves from
adverse exogenous shocks]{.underline}. The global petroleum company
Shell, a pioneer of the technique, characterizes scenario analysis as
the art of considering "what if" questions about possible future worlds.
[[Scenario analysis is]{.mark} thus **[typically seen as serving the
purposes of corporate planning or as a policy
tool]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}to be used in combination with
simulations of decision making. **[Yet scenario analysis [is not
inherently limited to these uses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This
section]{.underline} provides a brief overview of the practice of
scenario analysis and the motivations underpinning its uses. It then
[makes a case for the utility of the technique for political science
scholarship]{.underline} and describes how the scenarios deployed at
NEFPC were created.¶ The Art of Scenario Analysis¶ [We characterize
[scenario analysis]{.mark} as [the art of juxtaposing current trends in
unexpected combinations in order to **articulate surprising and yet
plausible futures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, often **[referred to as
"alternative worlds."]{.underline}** [[Scenarios
a]{.mark}re]{.underline} thus **[explicitly not forecasts or projections
based on linear extrapolations of contemporary patterns]{.underline}**,
[and they are **[not hypothesis-based expert
predictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Nor should they be equated with
simulation]{.underline}**]{.mark}[**s**, which are]{.underline} best
characterized as [functional representations of **real institutions** or
decision-making processes]{.underline} (Asal 2005). **[Instead, [they
are depictions of possible future states of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**, offered **[together with a narrative of
the driving causal forces]{.underline}** and potential exogenous shocks
**[that could lead to those futures]{.underline}**. Good scenarios thus
rely on explicit causal propositions that, independent of one another,
are plausible---yet, when combined, suggest surprising and sometimes
controversial future worlds. For example, few predicted the dramatic
fall in oil prices toward the end of 2014. Yet independent driving
forces, such as the shale gas revolution in the United States, China's
slowing economic growth, and declining conflict in major Middle Eastern
oil producers such as Libya, were all recognized secular trends
that---combined with OPEC's decision not to take concerted action as
prices began to decline---came together in an unexpected way.¶ While
scenario analysis played a role in war gaming and strategic planning
during the Cold War, the real antecedents of the contemporary practice
are found in corporate futures studies of the late 1960s and early 1970s
(Raskin et al. 2005). Scenario analysis was essentially initiated at
Royal Dutch Shell in 1965, with the realization that the usual
forecasting techniques and models were not capturing the rapidly
changing environment in which the company operated (Wack 1985; Schwartz
1991). In particular, it had become evident that straight-line
extrapolations of past global trends were inadequate for anticipating
the evolving business environment. Shell-style scenario planning "helped
break the habit, ingrained in most corporate planning, of assuming that
the future will look much like the present" (Wilkinson and Kupers 2013,
4). Using scenario thinking, Shell anticipated the possibility of two
Arab-induced oil shocks in the 1970s and hence was able to position
itself for major disruptions in the global petroleum sector.¶ Building
on its corporate roots, scenario analysis has become a standard
policymaking tool. For example, the Project on Forward Engagement
advocates linking systematic foresight, which it defines as the
disciplined analysis of alternative futures, to planning and feedback
loops to better equip the United States to meet contemporary governance
challenges (Fuerth 2011). Another prominent application of scenario
thinking is found in the National Intelligence Council's series of
Global Trends reports, issued every four years to aid policymakers in
anticipating and planning for future challenges. These reports present a
handful of "alternative worlds" approximately twenty years into the
future, carefully constructed on the basis of emerging global trends,
risks, and opportunities, and intended to stimulate thinking about
geopolitical change and its effects.4 As with corporate scenario
analysis, the technique can be used in foreign policymaking for
long-range general planning purposes as well as for anticipating and
coping with more narrow and immediate challenges. An example of the
latter is the German Marshall Fund's EuroFutures project, which uses
four scenarios to map the potential consequences of the Euro-area
financial crisis (German Marshall Fund 2013).¶ [[Several features make
scenario analysis particularly useful for
policymak]{.mark}ing]{.underline}.5 [Long-term global trends across a
number of different realms]{.underline}---social, technological,
environmental, economic, and political---[combine in often-unexpected
ways to produce unforeseen challenges]{.underline}. [Yet [the ability of
decision makers to imagine, let alone prepare for,
discontinuities]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in the policy realm [[is
constrained by their existing mental models and
maps]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This limitation is [exacerbated by]{.mark}
**well-known cognitive bias tendencies such as [groupthink and
confirmation bias]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}(Jervis 1976; Janis
1982; Tetlock 2005). [[The power of scenarios lies in their ability to
help individuals **break out of conventional modes of thinking**]{.mark}
and analysis by introducing unusual combinations of trends and
deliberate discontinuities in narratives about the future]{.underline}.
**[Imagining alternative future worlds through a structured analytical
process enables policymakers to envision and thereby adapt to something
altogether different from the known present]{.underline}**.¶ Designing
Scenarios for Political Science Inquiry¶ The characteristics of scenario
analysis that commend its use to policymakers also make it well suited
to helping political scientists generate and develop policy-relevant
research programs. [Scenarios are essentially textured, plausible, and
relevant stories that help us imagine how the future]{.underline}
political-economic world [could be different from the past]{.underline}
in a manner that highlights policy challenges and opportunities. For
example, terrorist organizations are a known threat that have captured
the attention of the policy community, yet our responses to them tend to
be linear and reactive. Scenarios that explore how seemingly unrelated
vectors of change---the rise of a new peer competitor in the East that
diverts strategic attention, volatile commodity prices that empower and
disempower various state and nonstate actors in surprising ways, and the
destabilizing effects of climate change or infectious disease
pandemics---can be useful for illuminating the nature and limits of the
terrorist threat in ways that may be missed by a narrower focus on
recognized states and groups. By illuminating the potential strategic
significance of specific and yet poorly understood opportunities and
threats, scenario analysis helps to identify crucial gaps in our
collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends and
dynamics. The notion of "exogeneity"---so prevalent in social science
scholarship---applies to models of reality, not to reality itself. [Very
simply, scenario analysis can throw into sharp relief often-overlooked
yet pressing questions in international affairs that demand focused
investigation]{.underline}.¶ [Scenarios thus offer]{.underline}, in
principle, [an innovative tool for developing a political science
research agenda]{.underline}. In practice, [achieving this objective
requires careful tailoring of the approach]{.underline}. The specific
scenario analysis technique we outline below was designed and refined to
provide a structured experiential process for generating problem-based
research questions with contemporary international policy relevance.6
The first step in the process of creating the scenario set described
here was to identify important causal forces in contemporary global
affairs. Consensus was not the goal; on the contrary, some of these
causal statements represented competing theories about global change
(e.g., a resurgence of the nation-state vs. border-evading globalizing
forces). A major principle underpinning the transformation of these
causal drivers into possible future worlds was to "simplify, then
exaggerate" them, before fleshing out the emerging story with more
details.7 Thus, the contours of the future world were drawn first in the
scenario, with details about the possible pathways to that point filled
in second. It is entirely possible, indeed probable, that some of the
causal claims that turned into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so
much as to be implausible, and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our
own form of groupthink went into construction of the scenarios. One of
the great strengths of scenario analysis, however, is that the scenario
discussions themselves, as described below, lay bare these especially
implausible claims and systematic biases.8¶ An explicit methodological
approach underlies the written scenarios themselves as well as the
analytical process around them---that of case-centered, structured,
focused comparison, intended especially to shed light on new causal
mechanisms (George and Bennett 2005). [The use of scenarios is similar
to counterfactual analysis in that it modifies certain variables in a
given situation in order to analyze the resulting effects]{.underline}
(Fearon 1991). [Whereas counterfactuals are traditionally
retrospective]{.underline} in nature and explore events that did not
actually occur in the context of known history, our [**[scenarios are
deliberately forward-looking]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
are [designed to **explore potential futures**]{.underline} that could
unfold. As such, counterfactual analysis is especially well suited to
identifying how individual events might expand or shift the "funnel of
choices" available to political actors and thus lead to different
historical outcomes (Nye 2005, 68--69), while forward-looking scenario
analysis can better illuminate surprising intersections and
sociopolitical dynamics without the perceptual constraints imposed by
fine-grained historical knowledge. [We see scenarios as a complementary
resource for exploring these dynamics in international affairs, rather
than as a replacement]{.underline} for counterfactual analysis,
historical case studies, or other methodological tools.¶ In the scenario
process developed for NEFPC, three distinct scenarios are employed,
acting as cases for analytical comparison. Each scenario, as detailed
below, includes a set of explicit "driving forces" which represent
hypotheses about causal mechanisms worth investigating in evolving
international affairs. The scenario analysis process itself employs
templates (discussed further below) to serve as a graphical
representation of a structured, focused investigation and thereby as the
research tool for conducting case-centered comparative analysis (George
and Bennett 2005). In essence, these templates articulate key observable
implications within the alternative worlds of the scenarios and serve as
a framework for capturing the data that emerge (King, Keohane, and Verba
1994). Finally, this structured, focused comparison serves as the basis
for the cross-case session emerging from the scenario analysis that
leads directly to the articulation of new research agendas.¶ [The
scenario process described here has thus been carefully designed to
offer some guidance to policy-oriented]{.underline} graduate [students
who are otherwise left to the relatively unstructured norms by which
political science]{.underline} dissertation [ideas are typically
developed]{.underline}. The initial articulation of a dissertation
project is generally an idiosyncratic and personal undertaking (Useem
1997; Rothman 2008), whereby students might choose topics based on their
coursework, their own previous policy exposure, or the topics studied by
their advisors. Research agendas are thus typically developed by looking
for "puzzles" in existing research programs (Kuhn 1996). Doctoral
students also, understandably, often choose topics that are particularly
amenable to garnering research funding. Conventional grant programs
typically base their funding priorities on extrapolations from what has
been important in the recent past---leading to, for example, the
prevalence of Japan and Soviet studies in the mid-1980s or terrorism
studies in the 2000s---in the absence of any alternative method for
identifying questions of likely future significance.¶ [The scenario
approach to generating research ideas is grounded in the belief that
these traditional approaches can be complemented by identifying
questions likely to be of great empirical importance in the real world,
even if these **do not appear**]{.underline} as puzzles [**in existing
research programs** or as clear extrapolations from past
events]{.underline}. The [[scenario]{.mark}s]{.underline} analyzed at
NEFPC [envision alternative worlds that could develop in the medium
(five to seven year) term and are designed to **[tease out issues
scholars and policymakers may encounter in the relatively near
future]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[so that they can **begin thinking
critically about them now**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [This timeframe offers
a period distant enough from the present as to avoid falling into
current events analysis, but not so far into the future as to seem like
science fiction]{.underline}. In imagining the worlds in which these
scenarios might come to pass, [[participants **learn strategies for
avoiding failures of creativity** and for **overturning the assumptions
that prevent scholars and analysts from anticipating and understanding**
the pivotal junctures that arise in international
affairs]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[This article introduces]{.underline} political scientists to
[scenarios]{.underline}---future counterfactuals---[and demonstrates

situates scenarios in the broader context of political science methods.

**nuclear [warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a circumstance that has never
resulted, but has captivated generations of political scientists. For an
introductory illustration, let us consider a very simple scenario
regarding how a first use of a nuclear weapon might occur: During the
year 2023, the US military is ordered to launch air and sea patrols of
the Taiwan Strait to aid in a crisis. These highly visible patrols
disrupt trade off China\'s coast, and result in skyrocketing insurance
rates for shipping companies. Several days into the contingency, which
involves over ten thousand US military personnel, an intelligence
estimate concludes that a Chinese conventional strike against US air
patrols and naval assets is imminent. The United States conducts a
preemptive strike against anti-air and anti-sea systems on the Chinese
mainland. The US strike is far more successful than Chinese military
leaders thought possible; a new source of intelligence to the United
States---unknown to Chinese leadership---allowed the US military to
severely degrade Chinese targeting and situational awareness
capabilities. Many of the weapons that China relied on to dissuade
escalatory US military action are now reduced to single-digit-percentage
readiness. Estimates for repairs and replenishments are stated in terms
of weeks, and China\'s confidence in readily available, but "dumber,"
weapons is low due to the dispersion and mobility of US forces. Word of
the successful US strike spreads among the Chinese and Taiwanese
publics. The Chinese Government concludes that for the sake of
preserving its domestic strength, and to signal resolve to the US and
Taiwanese Governments while minimizing further economic disruption, it
should escalate dramatically with the use of an extremely small-yield
nuclear device against a stationary US military asset in the Pacific
region. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} short story [[reflects]{.mark} a

### 2AC -- Extinction First 

#### The aff outweighs -- extinction is the upmost moral evil and disavowal of the risk makes it more likely

**Burns 17** (Elizabeth. Elizabeth Finneron-Burns is a Teaching Fellow
at the University of Warwick and an Affiliated Researcher at the
Institute for Futures Studies in Stockholm, What's wrong with human
extinction?

Canadian Journal of Philosophy, 2017)

Many, though certainly not all, people might believe that it would be
wrong to bring about the end of the human species, and the reasons given
for this belief are various. I begin by considering four reasons that
could be given against the moral permissibility of human extinction. I
will argue that only those reasons that impact the people who exist at
the time that the extinction or the knowledge of the upcoming extinction
occurs, can explain its wrongness. I use this conclusion to then
consider in which cases human extinction would be morally permissible or
impermissible, arguing that there is only a small class of cases in
which it would not be wrong to cause the
[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark} of the human race or allow it to
happen. 2.1. It [would [prevent]{.mark} the [existence]{.mark} of very
many]{.underline} happy [people]{.underline} One reason of human
extinction might be considered to be wrong lies in the value of human
life itself. The thought here might be that [[it is]{.mark} a
[good]{.mark} thing [for people to exist]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}and enjoy happy lives [[and extinction would deprive]{.mark}
more [people of]{.mark} enjoying [this]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}good. [The 'good]{.underline}' in this case [could be
understood in]{.underline} at least [two ways.]{.underline} According to
the [first]{.underline}, one might believe that you benefit a person by
bringing them into existence, or at least, that [it is good for that
person that they come to exist]{.underline}. The second view might hold
that [if humans were to go extinct]{.underline}, [the utility
[foregone]{.mark} by the [billions]{.mark} (or more) of people who could
have lived but [will]{.mark} now [never get that
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}, renders allowing human extinction to
take place an incidence of wrongdoing. An example of this view can be
found in two quotes from an Effective Altruism blog post by Peter
Singer, Nick Beckstead and Matt Wage: One very bad thing about human
extinction would be that **[[billions of people would]{.mark} likely
[die painful deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But in our view, this is by
far not the worst thing about human extinction. [The worst thing about
human extinction is that [there would be no future
generations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since there could be so many
generations in our future, **[[the value of all those generations
together greatly exceeds the value of the current
generation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. (Beckstead, Singer, and Wage 2013)
The authors are making two claims. The first is that [there is value in
human life and]{.underline} also [something valuable about creating
future people]{.underline} which gives us a reason to do so;
furthermore, it would be a very bad thing if we did not do so. The
second is that, not only would it be a bad thing for there to be no
future people, but it would actually be the worst thing about
extinction. Since happy human lives have value, and the number of
potential people who could ever exist is far greater than the number of
people who exist at any one time, even if the extinction were brought
about through the painful deaths of currently existing people, the
former's loss would be greater than the latter's. Both claims are
assuming that there is an intrinsic value in the existence of potential
human life. The second claim makes the further assumption that the
forgone value of the potential lives that could be lived is greater than
the disvalue that would be accrued by people existing at the time of the
extinction through suffering from painful and/or premature deaths. The
best-known author of the post, Peter Singer is a prominent utilitarian,
so it is not surprising that he would lament the potential lack of
future human lives per se. However, it is not just utilitarians who
share this view, even if implicitly. Indeed, other philosophers also
seem to imply that they share the intuition that there is just something
wrong with causing or failing to prevent the extinction of the human
species such that we prevent more 'people' from having the 'opportunity
to exist'. Stephen Gardiner (2009) and Martin O'Neill (personal
correspondence), both sympathetic to contract theory, for example, also
find it intuitive that we should want more generations to have the
opportunity to exist, assuming that they have worth-living lives, and I
find it plausible to think that many other people (philosophers and
non-philosophers alike) probably share this intuition. [When we talk
about [future lives being 'prevented']{.mark}, we are saying
that]{.underline} [a possible]{.underline} person or a [set]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} possible [people who could potentially have existed
will now never actually come to exist]{.underline}. To say that it is
wrong to prevent people from existing could either mean that a possible
person could reasonably reject a principle that permitted us not to
create them, or that the foregone value of their lives provides a reason
for rejecting any principle that permits extinction. To make the first
claim we would have to argue that a possible person could reasonably
reject any principle that prevented their existence on the grounds that
it prevented them in particular from existing. However, this is
implausible for two reasons. First, we can only wrong someone who did,
does or will actually exist because wronging involves failing to take a
person's interests into account. When considering the permissibility of
a principle allowing us not to create Person X, we cannot take X's
interest in being created into account because X will not exist if we
follow the principle. By considering the standpoint of a person in our
deliberations we consider the burdens they will have to bear as a result
of the principle. In this case, there is no one who will bear any
burdens since if the principle is followed (that is, if we do not create
X), X will not exist to bear any burdens. So, only people who do/will
actually exist can bear the brunt of a principle, and therefore occupy a
standpoint that is owed justification. Second, existence is not an
interest at all and a possible person is not disadvantaged by not being
caused to exist. Rather than being an interest, it is a necessary
requirement in order to have interests. Rivka Weinberg describes it as
'neutral' because causing a person to exist is to create a subject who
can have interests; existence is not an interest itself.3 In order to be
disadvantaged, there must be some detrimental effect on your interests.
However, without existence, a person does not have any interests so they
cannot be disadvantaged by being kept out of existence. But, as Weinberg
points out, 'never having interests itself could not be contrary to
people's interests since without interest bearers, there can be no
'they' for it to be bad for' (Weinberg 2008, 13). So, a principle that
results in some possible people never becoming actual does not impose
any costs on those 'people' because nobody is disadvantaged by not
coming into existence.4 It therefore seems that it cannot be wrong to
fail to bring particular people into existence. This would mean that no
one acts wrongly when they fail to create another person. Writ large, it
would also not be wrong if everybody decided to exercise their
prerogative not to create new people and potentially, by consequence,
allow human extinction. One might respond here by saying that although
it may be permissible for one person to fail to create a new person, it
is not permissible if everyone chooses to do so because human lives have
value and allowing human extinction would be to forgo a huge amount of
value in the world. This takes us to the second way of understanding the
potential wrongness of preventing people from existing --- the foregone
value of a life provides a reason for rejecting any principle that
prevents it. One possible reply to this claim turns on the fact that
many philosophers acknowledge that the only, or at least the best, way
to think about the value of (individual or groups of) possible people's
lives is in impersonal terms (Parfit 1984; Reiman 2007; McMahan 2009).
Jeff McMahan, for example, writes 'at the time of one's choice there is
no one who exists or will exist independently of that choice for whose
sake one could be acting in causing him or her to exist ... it seems
therefore that any reason to cause or not to cause an individual to
exist ... is best considered an impersonal rather than
individual-affecting reason' (McMahan 2009, 52). Another reply along
similar lines would be to appeal to the value that is lost or at least
foregone when we fail to bring into existence a next (or several next)
generations of people with worth-living lives. Since ex hypothesi
worth-living lives have positive value, it is better to create more such
lives and worse to create fewer. Human extinction by definition is the
creation of no future lives and would 'deprive' billions of 'people' of
the opportunity to live worth-living lives. This might reduce the amount
of value in the world at the time of the extinction (by killing already
existing people), but it would also prevent a much vaster amount of
value in the future (by failing to create more people). Both replies
depend on the impersonal value of human life. However, recall that in
contractualism impersonal values are not on their own grounds for
reasonably rejecting principles. Scanlon himself says that although we
have a strong reason not to destroy existing human lives, this reason
'does not flow from the thought that it is a good thing for there to be
more human life rather than less' (104). In contractualism, something
cannot be wrong unless there is an impact on a person. Thus, neither the
impersonal value of creating a particular person nor the impersonal
value of human life writ large could on its own provide a reason for
rejecting a principle permitting human extinction. It seems therefore
that the fact that extinction would deprive future people of the
opportunity to live worth-living lives (either by failing to create
either particular future people or future people in general) cannot
provide us with a reason to consider human extinction to be wrong.
Although the lost value of these 'lives' itself cannot be the reason
explaining the wrongness of extinction, it is possible the knowledge of
this loss might create a personal reason for some existing people. I
will consider this possibility later on in section (d). But first I move
to the second reason human extinction might be wrong per se. 2.2. **[[It
would mean the loss of the only known form of intelligent life]{.mark}
and all civilization and intellectual progress would be
lost]{.underline}** A second reason we might think it would be wrong to
cause human extinction is the loss that would occur of the only (known)
form of rational life and the knowledge and civilization that that form
of life has created. One thought here could be that just as some might
consider it wrong to destroy an individual human heritage monument like
the Sphinx, it would also be wrong if the advances made by humans over
the past few millennia were lost or prevented from progressing. A
related argument is made by those who feel that there is something
special about [[humans' capacity for rationality]{.underline}]{.mark}
which [[is valuable in itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since humans are the
only intelligent life that we know of, it would be a loss, in itself, to
the world for that to end. I admit that I struggle to fully appreciate
this thought. It seems to me that Henry Sidgwick was correct in thinking
that these things are only important insofar as they are important to
humans (Sidgwick 1874, I.IX.4).5 If there is no form of intelligent life
in the future, who would there be to lament its loss since intelligent
life is the only form of life capable of appreciating intelligence?
Similarly, if there is no one with the rational capacity to appreciate
historic monuments and civil progress, who would there be to be
negatively affected or even notice the loss?6 However, even if there is
nothing special about human rationality, just as some people try to
prevent the extinction of nonhuman animal species, we might think that
[we ought also to prevent human extinction for the sake of
biodiversity]{.underline}. The thought in this, as well as the earlier
examples, must be that it would somehow be bad for the world if there
were no more humans even though there would be no one for whom it is
bad. This may be so but the only way to understand this reason is
impersonally. Since we are concerned with wrongness rather than badness,
we must ask whether something that impacts no one's well-being, status
or claims can be wrong. As we saw earlier, in the contractualist
framework reasons must be personal rather than impersonal in order to
provide grounds for reasonable rejection (Scanlon 1998, 218--223). Since
the loss of civilization, intelligent life or biodiversity are per se
impersonal reasons, there is no standpoint from which these reasons
could be used to reasonably reject a principle that permitted
extinction. Therefore, causing human extinction on the grounds of the
loss of civilization, rational life or biodiversity would not be wrong.
2.3. **[[Existing people would endure physical pain and]{.mark}/or
[painful]{.mark} and/or [premature deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}Thinking about the ways in which human extinction might come
about brings to the fore two more reasons it might be wrong. It could,
for example, occur if all humans (or at least the critical number needed
to be unable to replenish the population, leading to eventual
extinction) underwent a sterilization procedure. Or perhaps it could
come about due to anthropogenic climate change or a massive asteroid
hitting the Earth and wiping out the species in the same way it did the
dinosaurs millions of years ago. [Each]{.underline} of these
[scenario]{.underline}s [would involve significant physical]{.underline}
[and/]{.underline}or [non-physical harms]{.underline} to existing people
and their interests. Physically, people might suffer premature and
possibly also painful deaths, for example. It is not hard to imagine
examples in which the process of [extinction could cause]{.underline}
[premature death]{.underline}. [A nuclear winter]{.underline} [that
killed everyone or even just every woman under the age of 50 is a clear
example of such a case]{.underline}. Obviously, some types of premature
death themselves cannot be reasons to reject a principle. Every person
dies eventually, sometimes earlier than the standard expected lifespan
due to accidents or causes like spontaneously occurring incurable
cancers. A cause such as disease is not a moral agent and therefore it
cannot be wrong if it unavoidably kills a person prematurely. Scanlon
says that the fact that a principle would reduce a person's well-being
gives that person a reason to reject the principle: 'components of
well-being figure prominently as grounds for reasonable rejection'
(Scanlon 1998, 214). However, it is not settled yet whether premature
death is a setback to well-being. Some philosophers hold that death is a
harm to the person who dies, whilst others argue that it is not.7 I will
argue, however, that regardless of who is correct in that debate, [being
caused to die prematurely can be reason to [reject a principle when it
fails to show respect to]{.mark} the [person as]{.mark} a [rational
agent]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scanlon says that recognizing others as
rational beings with interests involves seeing reason to preserve life
and prevent death: '[appreciating]{.underline} [the value of human life
is primarily a matter of]{.underline} [seeing human lives
as]{.underline} something [to be respected]{.underline}, where this
involves seeing reasons not to destroy them, reasons to protect them,
and reasons to want them to go well' (Scanlon 1998, 104). The 'respect
for life' in this case is a respect for the person living, not respect
for human life in the abstract. This means that we can sometimes fail to
protect human life without acting wrongfully if we still respect the
person living. Scanlon gives the example of a person who faces a life of
unending and extreme pain such that she wishes to end it by committing
suicide. Scanlon does not think that the suicidal person shows a lack of
respect for her own life by seeking to end it because the person whose
life it is has no reason to want it to go on. This is important to note
because it emphasizes the fact that the respect for human life is
person-affecting. It is not wrong to murder because of the impersonal
disvalue of death in general, but because [taking someone's life without
their permission shows disrespect to that person]{.underline}. This
supports its inclusion as a reason in the contractualist formula,
regardless of what side ends up winning the 'is death a harm?' debate
because even if death turns out not to harm the person who died, ending
their life without their consent shows disrespect to that person. A
person who could reject a principle permitting another to cause his or
her premature death presumably does not wish to die at that time, or in
that manner. Thus, **[if they are [killed without their consent]{.mark},
their [interests have not been taken into
account]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and they have a reason to reject the
principle that allowed their premature death.8 This is as true in the
case of death due to extinction as it is for death due to murder.
However, physical pain may also be caused to existing people without
killing them, but still resulting in human extinction. Imagine, for
example, surgically removing everyone's reproductive organs in order to
prevent the creation of any future people. Another example could be [a
nuclear bomb that did not kill anyone, but did painfully render them
infertile through illness or injury]{.underline}. These would be cases
in which physical pain (through surgery or bombs) was inflicted on
existing people and the extinction came about as a result of the painful
incident rather than through death. Furthermore, one could imagine a
situation in which a bomb (for example) killed enough people to cause
extinction, but some people remained alive, but in terrible pain from
injuries. It seems uncontroversial that the infliction of physical pain
could be a reason to reject a principle. Although Scanlon says that an
impact on well-being is not the only reason to reject principles, it
plays a significant role, and indeed, most principles are likely to be
rejected due to a negative impact on a person's well-being, physical or
otherwise. It may be queried here whether it is actually the
involuntariness of the pain that is grounds for reasonable rejection
rather than the physical pain itself because not all pain that a person
suffers is involuntary. One can imagine acts that can cause physical
pain that are not rejectable --- base jumping or life-saving or
improving surgery, for example. On the other hand, pushing someone off a
cliff or cutting him with a scalpel against his will are clearly
rejectable acts. The difference between the two cases is that in the
former, the person having the pain inflicted has consented to that pain
or risk of pain. My view is that they cannot be separated in these cases
and it is involuntary physical pain that is the grounds for reasonable
rejection. Thus, the fact that a principle would allow unwanted physical
harm gives a person who would be subjected to that harm a reason to
reject the principle. Of course the mere fact that a principle causes
involuntary physical harm or premature death is not sufficient to
declare that the principle is rejectable --- there might be
countervailing reasons. In the case of extinction, what countervailing
reasons might be offered in favour of the involuntary physical pain/
death-inducing harm? One such reason that might be offered is that
humans are a harm to the natural environment and that the world might be
a better place if there were no humans in it. It could be that humans
might rightfully be considered an all-things-considered hindrance to the
world rather than a benefit to it given the fact that we have been
largely responsible for the extinction of many species, pollution and,
most recently, climate change which have all negatively affected the
natural environment in ways we are only just beginning to understand.
Thus, the fact that human extinction would improve the natural
environment (or at least prevent it from degrading further), is a
countervailing reason in favour of extinction to be weighed against the
reasons held by humans who would experience physical pain or premature
death. However, the good of the environment as described above is by
definition not a personal reason. Just like the loss of rational life
and civilization, therefore, it cannot be a reason on its own when
determining what is wrong and countervail the strong personal reasons to
avoid pain/death that is held by the people who would suffer from it.9
Every person existing at the time of the extinction would have a reason
to reject that principle on the grounds of the physical pain they are
being forced to endure against their will that could not be
countervailed by impersonal considerations such as the negative impact
humans may have on the earth. Therefore, a principle that permitted
extinction to be accomplished in a way that caused involuntary physical
pain or premature death could quite clearly be rejectable by existing
people with no relevant countervailing reasons. This means that human
extinction that came about in this way would be wrong. There are of
course also additional reasons they could reject a similar principle
which I now turn to address in the next section. 2.4. **[[Existing
people could endure non-physical harms]{.underline}]{.mark}** I said
earlier than [the fact]{.underline} in itself that [there would not be
any future people]{.underline} is an impersonal reason and can therefore
not be a reason to reject a principle permitting extinction. However,
this impersonal reason [could give rise to a personal
reason]{.underline} that is admissible. So, the final important reason
people might think that human extinction would be wrong is that [[there
could be various]{.mark} deleterious [psychological
effects]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}that would be endured by existing
people having the knowledge that there would be no future generations.
[There are two main sources of this trauma]{.underline}, both arising
from the knowledge that there will be no more people. [The first relates
to individual people and the undesired negative effect on
well-being]{.underline} [that would be experienced by those who would
have wanted to have children]{.underline}. Whilst **[this is [by no
means universal]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[it is fair to say that a good
proportion of people feel a strong pull towards
reproduction]{.underline}** and having their lineage continue in some
way. Samuel Scheffler describes the pull towards reproduction as a
'desire for a personalized relationship with the future' (Scheffler
2012, 31). Reproducing is a widely held desire and the joys of
parenthood are ones that many people wish to experience. For these
people knowing that they would not have descendants (or that their
descendants will endure painful and/or premature deaths) could create a
sense of despair and pointlessness of life. Furthermore, the inability
to reproduce and have your own children because of a principle/policy
that prevents you (either through bans or physical interventions) would
be a significant infringement of what we consider to be a basic right to
control what happens to your body. For these reasons, knowing that you
will have no descendants could cause significant psychological traumas
or harms even if there were no associated physical harm. [The second is
a]{.underline} more general, [higher level [sense of
hopelessness]{.mark} or [despair]{.mark} that [there will be no more
humans and that your projects will end with
you]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Even those who did not feel a strong
desire to procreate themselves might feel a sense of hopelessness that
any projects or goals they have for the future would not be
fulfilled]{.underline}. Many of the projects and goals we work towards
during our lifetime are also at least partly future-oriented. Why bother
continuing the search for a cure for cancer if either it will not be
found within humans' lifetime, and/or there will be no future people to
benefit from it once it is found? Similar projects and goals that might
lose their meaning when confronted with extinction include politics,
artistic pursuits and even the type of philosophical work with which
this paper is concerned. Even more extreme, through the words of the
character Theo Faron, P.D. James says in his novel The Children of Men
that '[without the hope of posterity for our race]{.underline} if not
for ourselves, without the assurance that we being dead yet live, [all
pleasures of the mind and senses sometimes seem to me no more than
pathetic and crumbling defences shored up against our
ruins']{.underline} (James 2006, 9). Even if James' claim is a bit
hyperbolic and all pleasures would not actually be lost, I agree with
Scheffler in finding it not implausible that the knowledge that
extinction was coming and that there would be no more people would have
at least a general depressive effect on people's motivation and
confidence in the value of and joy in their activities (Scheffler 2012,
43). [Both sources of [psychological harm are personal reasons to
reject]{.mark} a [principle that permitted human
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Existing people could therefore
reasonably reject the principle for either of these reasons.
Psychological pain and the inability to pursue your personal projects,
goals, and aims, are all acceptable reasons for rejecting principles in
the contractualist framework. So too are infringements of rights and
entitlements that we accept as important for people's lives. These
psychological reasons, then, are also valid reasons to reject principles
that permitted or required human extinction.

In this argument, it seems that Parfit is assuming that the survivors of
a nuclear war that kills 99% of the population would eventually be able
to recover civilisation without long-term effect. As we have seen, this
may not be a safe assumption -- but for the purposes of this thought
experiment, the point stands. What makes [existential
catastrophes]{.underline} especially bad is that they [would "destroy
the future,"]{.underline} as another Oxford philosopher, Nick Bostrom,
puts it.66 [This future could]{.underline} potentially [be **extremely
long** and **full of flourishing**, and]{.underline} would therefore
[have **extremely large value**. In standard risk analysis]{.underline},
when working out how to respond to risk, [we [work out]{.mark} the
expected [value]{.mark}]{.underline} of risk reduction, [by weighing
**the probability**]{.underline} that [an action will prevent **an
adverse event** against **the severity** of the event.
Because]{.underline} the value of preventing [existential catastrophe is
**so vast**, **even [a tiny probability]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
prevention [[has **huge**]{.mark} **expected
[value]{.mark}**]{.underline}.67 Of course, there is persisting
reasonable disagreement about ethics and there are a number of ways one
might resist this conclusion.68 Therefore, it would be unjustified to be
overconfident in Parfit and Bostrom's argument. In some areas,
government policy does give significant weight to future generations.
For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear waste storage,
governments have considered timeframes of thousands, hundreds of
thousands, and even a million years.69 [Justifications]{.underline} for
this policy usually [appeal to principles of ***intergenerational
equity*** according to which **future generations** ought to get **as
much protection** as current generations]{.underline}.70 Similarly,
widely accepted norms of sustainable development require development
that meets the needs of the current generation without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs.71 However, when
it comes to **[[ex]{.mark}istential [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it
[would]{.underline} seem that we [[fail to live up to]{.mark} principles
of **intergenerational [equity]{.mark}**. Existential [catastrophe
would]{.mark} not only [give future gen]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} **less
than the current generations**; it would give them
***[nothing]{.mark}***]{.underline}. Indeed, [reducing existential
risk]{.underline} plausibly [has **a quite low cost** for us in
comparison with **the huge expected value** it has for future
generations. In spite of this, **relatively little** is done to reduce
existential risk]{.underline}. Unless we give up on [norms of
**intergenerational equity**]{.underline}, they [give us **a strong
case**]{.underline} for significantly increasing our efforts [to reduce
existential risks]{.underline}. 1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE
SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY In spite of the importance of [existential risk
reduction]{.underline}, it probably [receives **less attention** than is
warranted]{.underline}. As a result, concerted international cooperation
is required if we are to receive adequate protection from existential
risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be underinvested in
There are several reasons why existential risk reduction is likely to be
underinvested in. Firstly, it is *a global public good*. Economic theory
predicts that such goods tend to be underprovided. The benefits of
existential risk reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed around
the globe from the countries responsible for taking action.
Consequently, [a country which reduces **existential risk** gains **only
a small portion** of the benefits but bears **the full brunt of the
costs**. Countries]{.underline} thus [have **strong incentives** to free
ride]{.underline}, receiving the benefits of risk reduction without
contributing. As a result, too few do what is in the common interest.
Secondly, as already suggested above, [**existential risk reduction** is
**an *intergenerational* public good**]{.underline}: most of [the
benefits are enjoyed by **future generations** who have **no say** in
the political process]{.underline}. For these goods, [the [problem is
***temporal* free riding**]{.mark}: the current [gen]{.mark}eration
[enjoys]{.mark} **the benefits of [inaction]{.mark}** [while future
gen]{.mark}eration[s bear **the costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thirdly,
many existential risks, such as machine superintelligence, engineered
pandemics, and solar geoengineering, pose an unprecedented and uncertain
future threat. Consequently, it is hard to develop a satisfactory
governance regime for them: there are few existing governance
instruments which can be applied to these risks, and it is unclear what
shape new instruments should take. In this way, our position with regard
to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we faced when nuclear
weapons first became available. **[Cognitive
[biases]{.mark}]{.underline}** also [[lead people to underestimate
ex]{.mark}istential [risks]{.mark}. Since there have not been **any
catastrophes** of this magnitude, these risks are **not
salient**]{.underline} to politicians and the public.72 [[This
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an example of the misapplication of [**the
*[availability]{.mark} [heuristic]{.mark}***, a mental shortcut which
[assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[something is important]{.mark}
**only [if]{.mark}** it can be **readily
[recalled]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[Another cognitive
bias]{.underline}** affecting perceptions of existential risk [is
**[scope neglect]{.mark}**. In **a seminal 1992 study**, three groups
were asked how much they would]{.underline} be [willing to pay to save
2,000]{.underline}, 20,000 [or 200,000 birds]{.underline} from drowning
in uncovered oil ponds. The groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88,
respectively.73 In this case, [[the size of]{.mark} the
[benefits]{.mark} had [**little effect** on]{.mark} the scale of the
preferred [response]{.mark}. [People]{.mark} **become [numbed]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the effect of [saving lives when]{.mark} the [numbers get
**too large**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} 74 [Scope neglect is **a
particularly acute problem** for existential risk because the numbers at
stake are **so large**]{.underline}. Due to scope neglect,
[decision-makers]{.underline} are prone to [treat existential
risks]{.underline} in a [similar]{.underline} way [to
problems]{.underline} which are [less severe by]{.underline} many orders
of [magnitude]{.underline}. A wide range of other cognitive biases are
likely to affect the evaluation of existential risks.75

[The project of]{.underline} critical [security studies was born out of
an **acknowledgement**]{.underline} [of the implicit]{.underline} and
[explicit **violence**]{.underline} [stemming from the
hegemony]{.underline} of
**[security]{.underline}**-cum-**[balance]{.underline}**. In what
follows, [I will discuss the limits of both]{.underline}
**[deconstructive]{.underline}** and reconstructive
**[approaches]{.underline}** in critical security studies' engagement
with the dominant logics of security.

[The deconstructive field includes]{.underline} a number of
[epistemological endeavors]{.underline} -- [including
poststructuralist]{.underline}, constructivist, neo-Marxist, post- and
de-colonial, feminist, and queer approaches -- [to overcome
**traditional**]{.underline}, [**realist** views of
**security**]{.underline}. This field has been quite successful -- to
the point of constituting a new mainstream in security studies14 -- in
[exposing the '**dark side'** of security]{.underline}, its role in
impeding the realization of a democratic politics (see Neal, 2019), and
more generally its crucial role in the maintenance of the capitalist
order (with its violence!). [The]{.underline} [ultimate version of this
critique is]{.underline} offered by Mark [Neocleous]{.underline},
[who]{.underline}, by exposing the roots of contemporary security,
beyond Hobbes, in liberal and Enlightenment thinkers such as Mill,
Rousseau, Smith, and Bentham, [has challenged the
'**myth'**]{.underline} [of the **balance**]{.underline} at its roots:
[security has]{.underline} [always been the **central goal**
of]{.underline} **[liberal thought]{.underline}**, [and liberty is
systematically infringed in **security's name**]{.underline} (Neocleous,
2007, 2008). **[Security]{.underline}**, **[Neocleous
concluded]{.underline}**, is the political technology of liberalism; it
is a project of social order (Neocleous, 2001) and **[must therefore be
rejected]{.underline}** (Neocleous, 2000). [The rejection]{.underline}
of security remains [at the core of other strands of
deconstruction]{.underline}. For instance, among the central tenets of
the Copenhagen School is the idea that securitization is at odds with
politics. Indeed, Ole Wæver (2011: 478n2) has even characterized
security as a Schmittian concept. Granted, I am not suggesting that
deconstructive approaches are not interested in the 'tangible
security'15 of individuals and communities -- quite the opposite -- but
rather that they have explicitly or implicitly concluded that only by
abandoning the concept of 'security' -- and, in some cases, replacing it
with other concepts like care or humanism -- can we strive for it.

I want to argue, then, that [the critique of
**securitization**]{.underline}, liberal balance, and the persistent
chimera of absolute security [does **not imply** that we need to
**reject security as a concept**]{.underline}. In order to make this
point, I will start by unpacking a corollary of the deconstructive
argument, [the]{.underline} [idea]{.underline} that [security is
inherently **antagonistic**]{.underline} [to **rights**]{.underline}
(Goldstein, 2010: 499). [This formulation]{.underline}, which is
coherent with the deconstruction of the myth of balancing security with
freedom, [neglects to **acknowledge** that]{.underline}
**[security]{.underline}** [is a **right too**]{.underline}, [though not
**only a right**]{.underline}.16 [Security]{.underline} -- a certain
degree [of freedom from threats]{.underline} -- [is]{.underline}
**[necessary]{.underline}** [for the **flourishing of
individuals**]{.underline} (see Nussbaum, 2011) [and for the
**empowerment**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[oppressed
groups]{.underline}** (see, for instance, bell hooks \[1991: 47\] [on
the importance of the **home**]{.underline} [as a space of **personal
safety** in the experience of black and brown women in the
USA]{.underline}). [Once we take **security** beyond
**securitization**]{.underline} [seriously, the **limits** of
**deconstructive critique**]{.underline} [become]{.underline}
**[evident]{.underline}**. [For one thing, by **overly focusing on
security as discourse and speech act**]{.underline}, [constructivist and
post-structuralist approaches]{.underline} (e.g. Huysmans, 2011;
Williams, 2003) [have largely **neglected** to engage]{.underline} [with
**insecurity**]{.underline} [and violence **existing beyond
securitization**]{.underline} [and the machine of state
security]{.underline}. On their side, critiques brought to the core of
security theories have demonstrated that actually existing security is
inherently defined by the liberal/Western project of social order, [but
this does not **exclude per se**]{.underline} [the possibility of
finding **different roots** for]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**
[outside of that very]{.underline} order -- [security
existed]{.underline}, for better or worse, [before the liberal order was
created]{.underline}, [and there may well be theories of security
**outside** of the **hegemony**]{.underline} [of
liberal]{.underline}/[Western thought]{.underline}. By [focusing on
**discourses**]{.underline}, [theories, and practices]{.underline}
(Harrington, 2017), in short, **[critique has]{.underline}** [forgotten
the **ontological dimension**]{.underline} -- [that is, 'the desire for
security -- **understood** as **certitude and trust**]{.underline} --
\[[which\] is seemingly **universal and timeless'**]{.underline}
(Harrington, 2017: 76, emphasis added).

### 1AR\-\--Perm do Both

#### Perm Best --- understanding particularized threats is best because it challenges monolithic narratives.

David Edelstein and Ronald Krebs, "Delusions of Grand Strategy," Foreign
Affairs, 11-xx-2015,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-10-20/delusions-grand-strategy

Instead of obsessing over strategy, [Washington should adopt a more
pragmatic approach]{.underline} to questions of policy. [This would
involve]{.underline} four main elements.

The first is [narrative pluralism. When a single narrative dominates
policy debates, only a limited range of options can be considered. At
the height of the Cold War consensus]{.underline}, for example,
[legitimate voices hewed to anticommunist axioms, which prevented
Washington from seizing opportunities to]{.underline} fracture the
communist bloc and [negotiate a stable arrangement with the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. Now, with the United States relatively secure and
the future of the global order up in the air, there should be room for
differing views over national security; there is no excuse for enforced
homogeneity. [Narrative pluralism facilitates flexibility, which runs
counter to the impulse to strategize]{.underline}. It is also often
unpopular. [Uncomfortable with narrative disorder, people clamor for
their leaders to make sense of the world around them]{.underline}. If
presidents fail to do so, they are pilloried as "unstrategic." [The
challenge for leaders]{.underline} today [is to satisfy the public's
demand for narrative order without overly narrowing the scope of
debate]{.underline}.

Second, [pragmatism involves **focusing on specific challenges** in lieu
of searching for an overarching foreign policy doctrine. Doctrines force
leaders to act for the sake of seeming consistent, even when it would be
wiser not to]{.underline}. Even offhand comments at press conferences
somehow become ironclad promises, or so Obama and his critics believed
when it came to Syrian chemical weapons use, and the pressures mount all
the more with officially endorsed doctrines. [A pragmatic approach would
**consider threats on their own terms** rather than as part of a larger
strategic worldview. And it would sustain a more **restrained foreign
policy** that avoids the distraction of peripheral
interventions]{.underline}.

Third, [a pragmatic approach would replace the ritual of periodic
strategizing with more regular venues for officials to articulate the
logic behind policy]{.underline}. Although national security sometimes
requires secrecy, there are limits to what democratically elected
governments should withhold from citizens. Citizens have the right to
demand that their leaders explain their foreign policy priorities and
initiatives and that their representatives in Congress, rather than
engage in political grandstanding, ask hard questions of and demand real
answers from the executive branch. An aggressive press, alongside strong
freedomof-information legislation, is an essential bulwark of democracy.
But the periodic publication of a formal national security
strategy---and the many related documents released down the bureaucratic
ladder---does not provide meaningful transparency. In its current form,
strategizing is little more than political spectacle.

Finally, [pragmatism calls for a more **experimental approach** to
foreign policy. Creativity emerges only from an organizational and
political environment that eschews rigid strategy and tolerates failure.
Successful organizations adapt fluidly to changing circumstances, create
cultures that permit experimentation, and learn from their
errors]{.underline}. The first rule of foreign policy should remain "Do
no harm," but much international harm can come from playing it safe.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must cultivate a
bureaucratic and political climate that is forgiving of small failures.
Only in that atmosphere can the country's foreign-policy makers go after

[In the works of these authors]{.underline}, [one can identify a
tendency to see security as inherently connected]{.underline} [to
exclusion, totalization and]{.underline} even [violence]{.underline}.
The idea of a 'logic' of security is now widely present in the critical
security studies literature. Claudia Aradau (2008: 72), for example,
writes of an 'exclusionary logic of security' underpinning and
legitimizing 'forms of domination'. Rens van Munster (2007: 239) assumes
a 'logic of security', predicated upon a 'political organization on the
exclusionary basis of fear'. Laura Shepherd (2008: 70) also identifies a
liberal and highly problematic 'organizational logic' in security.
Although there would probably be disagreement over the degree to which
[this logic]{.underline} is inescapable, it [is symptomatic of an
overwhelmingly pessimistic]{.underline} [outlook]{.underline} that a
great number of critical scholars are now making the case for moving
away from security. The normative preference for desecuritization has
been picked up in attempts to contest, resist and 'unmake' security
(Aradau, 2004; Huysmans, 2006; Bigo, 2007). For these contributions,
security cannot be reconstructed and political transformation can only
be brought about when security and its logic are removed from the
equation (Aradau, 2008; Van Munster, 2009; Peoples, 2011). [This
tendency]{.underline} in the literature [is **problematic**]{.underline}
for the critique of security in at least three ways. [First, it
constitutes a blind spot in the effort of politicization.]{.underline}
[The assumption of a]{.underline}n exclusionary, totalizing or [violent
logic]{.underline} of security [can be seen as an essentialization and
**a moment of closure**]{.underline}. To be faithful to itself, the
politicization of security would need to recognize that there is nothing
natural or necessary about security -- and that security as a paradigm
of thought or a register of meaning is also a construction that depends
upon its reproduction and performance through practice.
[The]{.underline} exclusionary and [violent meanings that have been
attached to security are]{.underline} themselves [the]{.underline}
[result of social and historical processes]{.underline}, [and **can**
thus **be changed**]{.underline}. [Second, the institution of this
apolitical realm runs counter to the purposes of critique by
**foreclosing an engagement** with the different ways in which security
may be constructed]{.underline}. As Matt McDonald (2012) has argued,
[because security means different things for different
people,]{.underline} **[one must always understand it in
context]{.underline}**. [Assuming from the start that security implies
the narrowing]{.underline} [of choice and the empowerment of an elite
forecloses the acknowledgment of security claims that may seek to
achieve exactly the opposite]{.underline}: [alternative
possibilities]{.underline} in an already narrow debate [and]{.underline}
[the contestation of elite power]{.underline}.5 In connection to this,
[the claims to insecurity]{.underline} put forward by individuals and
groups [run the risk of being **neglected**]{.underline} [if the desire
to be more secure is identified with]{.underline} [a compulsion towards
totalization]{.underline}, [and if aspirations to a life with a degree
of predictability are]{.underline} [identified with
violence.]{.underline} Finally, [this tendency **blunts** **critical**
**security studies as a resource for** practical
**politics**]{.underline}. [By overlooking]{.underline} [the possibility
of **reconsidering security from within**]{.underline} -- [opting
instead for its replacement]{.underline} with other ideals -- [the
critical field weakens its capacity to confront head-on the
exceptionalist]{.underline} [connotations that security has acquired in
policymaking circles]{.underline}. [Critical scholars run the risk of
playing into this agenda when they tie security to]{.underline}
exclusionary and [violent practices]{.underline}, [thereby failing to
question security actors as they take those views for granted and act as
if they were inevitable]{.underline}. Overall, security is just too
important -- both as a concept and as a political instrument -- to be
simply abandoned by critical scholars. As McDonald (2012: 163) has put
it, If security is politically powerful, is the foundation of political
legitimacy for a range of actors, and involves the articulation of our
core values and the means of their protection, we cannot afford to allow
dominant discourses of security to be confused with the essence of
security itself. In sum, the trajectory that [critical security
studies]{.underline} has taken in recent years [has significant
**limitations**]{.underline}. The politicization of security has made
extraordinary progress in problematizing predominant security ideas and
practices; however, it has paradoxically resulted in a depoliticization
of the meaning of security itself. [By foreclosing the possibility of
alternative notions of security, this imbalanced politicization weakens
the analytical capacity of critical security studies, undermines its
ability to function as a political resource and runs the risk of
**being** politically **counterproductive**]{.underline}. Seeking to
address these limitations, the next section revisits emancipatory
understandings of security.

Tragedy is largely absent from the existing normative debate on
securitization. Instead, the [debate has]{.underline} become [organized
around whether securitization is a "negative" or "positive"
concept]{.underline}. In the classic formulation, the Copenhagen School
points to how "\[n\]ational security should not be idealized. It works
to silence opposition and has given power-holders many opportunities to
exploit 'threats' for domestic purposes" (Buzan et al. 1998, 29;
Williams 2003). [Securitization has negative effects when it functions
as "a political technology that consistently favors the interests of the
powerful and enables violence and exclusion"]{.underline} (McDonald
2015, 154). Correspondingly, Wæver admits a "'bias' for
desecuritization" or de-escalation, although he quickly notes that this
is "not always better than securitization" (Wæver 2011, 469). [At the
same time]{.underline}, a number of approaches point to cases where
[securitization]{.underline} [is ethically desirable]{.underline}. In
her compelling consequentialist argument, for example, Floyd asks
"whether the consequences of, and the gains from, the securitization are
preferable relative to the consequences and gains from a politicization"
(2007, 338). Relatedly, Roe contends that "[the extent to which
securitization necessitates a lack of openness and deliberation has been
overexaggerated" and suggests it may even elicit unappreciated forms of
cooperation]{.underline} (2012, 250).

[The problem with the negative/positive debate is that it appears to
impose moral certitude where there often is none.]{.underline}
[Registering securitizing moves as clearly positive or negative can be
difficult because their effects can be mixed and temporally
distant]{.underline}. The difficulty in making this determination may
also be an indicator of the uncertainty surrounding securitizing moves.
[In the end, because the outcomes of security claims are uncertain, we
cannot know in advance whether they will lead to positive or negative
consequences.]{.underline} Instead, [we should entertain a distinctly
tragic vision of securitization that council]{.underline}s [an ethic of
self-limitation]{.underline}. The core of this tragic vision is a
recognition that the powerful allure of using security talk to "gain
control" over a situation will always be present (Wæver 1995, 54).
However, we should also recognize that this control is always illusory
because it presumes all of its effects can be predetermined. The tragedy
of securitization is that the failure to recognize how contingency
imposes limits on action lures political actors into a false sense of
certainty and the conviction that they can determine the future. This
leads to a hubristic adoption of "misplaced certainty," such as when
Vice President Dick Cheney declared in August of 2002 that "there is no
doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction" (quoted
in Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 3). A similar situation emerged when
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld subsequently claimed in November
that the Iraq conflict could be "\[f\]ive days or five weeks or five
months, but it certainly isn't going to last any longer than that"
(Esterbrook 2002). A similarly misplaced certainty is evident in US
General Stanley McChrystal's assurances to the Obama administration in
2009 that a surge in troops and resources were critical to stave off
American defeat in Afghanistan (Woodward 2009). More recently, it is
visible in President Donald Trump's 2018 assertion that he was "100
percent right" on the weaknesses of the Iran nuclear deal (CNN 2018).

Yet, tragedy cuts both ways. [Blanket opposition]{.underline} [to
securitizing moves]{.underline} can also [have unanticipated
effects]{.underline}. Ironically, the [desecuritization of an issue may
not just result in its repoliticization]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} its [disappearance from public view]{.underline} (Floyd
2010, 57--58). [Viewing security discourse as negative also underplays
how the management of threats can serve as a focal point for democratic
cooperation among different political actors]{.underline} (Roe 2012,
250, 257--58). The point is not that every security discourse and the
practices it justifies has catastrophically perverse consequences.
Instead, the goal is to highlight a sensible restraint over the limits
of seeing into the future, how this shapes choice, and the dangers of
hubris that follow. [When]{.underline} properly [adapted]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} this [constructivist context]{.underline}, the tragic
vision of [securitization can be an important tool in cultivating
prudence and restraint]{.underline} (cf. Lebow 2003, 364).

The problem with this tragic vision is that it points to
[processes]{.underline} that [are never]{.underline} entirely [in our
possession]{.underline}. [Whether in the form of background
knowledge]{.underline} (Pouliot 2008), [habits]{.underline} (Hopf 2010),
[or routines]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006), much of [social life occurs
without conscious deliberation]{.underline} and reflection. These forms
of unthinking action impair reflexivity and limit actors' ability to see
how the world might be different and thus how outcomes can be uncertain.
In some cases, this can be benign, such as the unreflexive amity between
Canada and the United States that allows these countries to "escape"
from the traditional security dilemma (Collins 2014, 572--73). But just
as practices of amity can be habitual, so too can enmity. [The hawkish
US senator may designate Iran's nuclear program as threatening because
that is what hawkish US senators do, and there is no perceived way to be
hawkish otherwise]{.underline}. The result is that the uncertainty
surrounding securitizing moves becomes concealed under an unthinking
veil of common sense. The tragedy of securitization then is not only
that political figures often exceed their limitations by ignoring how
contingency can derail securitizing moves---it is that these limitations
often never even register

This means overcoming the tragedy of securitization require a certain
degree self-reflexivity. This is similar to what Booth and Wheeler
describe as the "security dilemma sensibility," or an actor's ability
and willingness to reflect upon their actions, including one's own role
in provoking insecurity in others (2008, 7). By sensitizing leaders to
how uncertainty is an endemic feature of political life, and how their
actions can be interpreted in unintended ways, security competition can
be mitigated, at least in part (Booth and Wheeler 2008, 265). Yet, these
moments of self-awareness and [reflection]{.underline} [are
difficult]{.underline} precisely [because there are powerful forces that
demand simplicity and closure: namely our desire for a stable sense of
self or what is widely referred to as ontological security]{.underline}
(Mitzen 2006). [Reflecting on the uncertainty of international politics
can erode one's sense of identity and agency]{.underline}, [ultimately
leading to a "deep, incapacitating state of not knowing how to get by in
the world"]{.underline} (Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 29). Booth and
Wheeler's security dilemma sensibility may have the laudable goal of
alerting leaders to the role of uncertainty in political life, but this
confronts the problem that many would prefer that it remain hidden.

The consequence is that this tragic aspect of the securitization dilemma
takes on an intractable character. Either unwilling or unable to "know
one's limits," as Herz would say (1950, 179), the role of uncertainty
becomes hidden and security claims appear as a reliable strategy for
control and influence. Like the classic realist dilemma, the
securitization dilemma is pervasive because it is often invisible. The
compelling need for a logic of selflimitation---of a careful and
reflective use of security language and how it can be derailed by
contingency--- is obscured because of an aversion to
recognizinguncertainty. It is this specter of a need for reflection and
restraint that may not be realized, I suggest, which demands that we
rethink the role of the analyst in provoking reflexivity among
power-holders.

Conclusion: Rethinking the Role of the Analyst

Motivated by the absence of unintended and perverse consequences in
constructivist theorizing of security, this article has pursued a
reconceptualization of the security dilemma. Viewing the dilemma as a
logic of limitation shaped by choice, uncertainty, and tragedy, the
argument focuses on transposing this logic to the constructivist context
of securitization theory. By showing how the choice to engage in the
social construction of threats is complicated by uncertainty and the
tragic failure to recognize one's own limits, the dilemma analytic helps
us to understand how securitization can be both a potent instrument for
mobilization, as well as a volatile source of unpredictability.
Moreover, this conceptual lens lays the foundation for an ethical
imperative of self-limitation among securitizing actors---albeit one
made difficult given the desire for simplicity and closure. Far from a
rebuke of constructivist theorizing, the argument shows that taking the
social character of security seriously means appreciating how political
claims are always vulnerable to being derailed by different types of
contingency.

This reconstructive move has important implications for studying the
social construction of security. First, while the initial influence of
realism on securitization theory is well-documented (Floyd 2010; Gad and
Peterson 2011), few attempts have been made to show how engaging with
these realist roots can yield new insights.22 Here, the reconstruction
of the security dilemma demonstrates how [returning to realist themes
can yield a fresh insights]{.underline}. Second, the argument pushes
scholars studying securitization to expand their universe of outcomes
beyond the reductive binary of success and failure and to consider cases
of perverse and unintended consequences. Not only are these outcomes
relatively common, they undercut the prevailing image of securitization
as a reliable technology of control. Third, the securitization dilemma
shows why uncertainty is more of an enduring problem for social action
than constructivists typically acknowledge. Contra earlier arguments
where learning and socialization effectively mitigate the problem of
uncertainty (Wendt 2006, 208--9), this perspective stresses how
contingency means that social acts like securitizing moves can have
unpredictable effects.

The most important result of this reconstruction, however, may be in how
taking the tragic element of the dilemma seriously reorders the
political role of the analyst. [Rather than assessing]{.underline} the
validity of [a particular security discourse]{.underline}, [or exposing
its socially constructed nature]{.underline}, [this
perspective]{.underline} asks the analyst to [provoke]{.underline}
[reflexivity]{.underline} [on behalf of power-holders over the risks
associated with securitization]{.underline}. While this entails a bias
toward deescalation and desecuritization, unlike other approaches this
is [not achieved through]{.underline} overt references to
[an]{.underline}y liberal, democratic, or [emancipatory
ideal]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, [it is packaged for
power-holders as a strategy of self-preservation]{.underline}. Here, the
analyst presents the move to securitize as a risk-laden and potentially
self-defeating strategy. The analyst points to a series of precedents
showing how such a strategy can produce perverse consequences: how
today\'s tough talk can become tomorrow\'s liability; how audiences can
interpret threatening messages in unexpected ways; and how today\'s
framing of security can lead to perverse consequences tomorrow. By
foregrounding the problem of uncertainty, the analyst works to
accentuate and impress upon actors the dilemmatic quality of
securitizing moves.

Yet, the problem with presenting the move to securitize as a risk is
that it may become accepted. Ironically, framing an escalation in enmity
as possible but dangerous is precisely what may legitimize such a move
in the eyes of risk-insensitive actors. This is Huysmans' (2002) now
familiar normative dilemma of writing security. The indeterminacy of
language means that political actors may interpret advice in
unpredictable ways. Frustratingly, this may include the precise opposite
of the analyst\'s intention. This situation is likely inescapable, but
it may be mitigated. What I suggest is that analysts should strive to
cultivate a deeper subjectivity of risk sensitivity, comparable to Booth
and Wheeler\'s security-dilemma sensibility, among political actors.

Key to this argument is how visions of the future satisfy the human
desire for certainty. As Berenskoetter argues, "visions depicting the
self in an imagined future order serve as anxiety controlling
mechanisms" (2011, 654). Visions of the future inoculate actors against
the anxiety of uncertainty by providing a narrative of where they are
going and how to get there. Indeed, normative debates on securitization
are already loaded with such visions. The impulse to securitize is
underpinned by a utopian future where the security frame can finally
mobilize a response to an otherwise intractable problem. Conversely, the
impulse to desecuritize is sustained by a dystopian future defined by
unrestrained authoritarian politics. A tragic vision of the future does
something different: it presents a future where the only thing we can
know decisively is that it is indeterminate and attempts to conclusively
control it are vulnerable to failure. The very recognition of
fundamental limits on human freedom (Steele 2007, 281--82) becomes
transformed into a source of ontological security. This tempers the
human need for cognitive closure by reconfiguring it into what Herz
understood as a "fundamentally humble posture toward the value and
precariousness of life" (Sylvest 2008, 442). [An actor with a greater
sensitivity to indeterminacy may still pursue securitizing moves, but
with a cautious awareness that they are volatile acts best pursued
sparingly]{.underline}. [The analyst does not simply educate political
leaders by pointing to the indeterminacy of the world; she seeks to make
political subjects more sensitive toward it by crafting visions of a
precarious future.]{.underline}

Finally, this tragic vision cannot, and should not, escape its own need
for reflexivity. Its scholarly proponents need to engage in their own
process of self-reflection, focusing on how their knowledge and
interests are themselves historically situated. The ethic of restraint
is a value, and not necessarily the value for all historical
circumstances. A recognition of the social construction of security
"facts" must be sobered by a recognition of the social construction of
security "values" (Hamati-Ataya 2012, 685).

New Dual Framework," Uluslararasi Iliskiler, 7-1-2020,
https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/1228409

[Despite its strengths and popularity in the last 20 years,
Securitization Theory has **several limitations**, some of which have
already been identified by different scholars]{.underline}. [The most
criticized aspect is its focus on speech acts]{.underline}.16 According
to McDonald, the theory over-emphasizes speech acts while neglecting
other processes or means for communication, such as images and other
visual representations like videos, which also play a significant role
in the process.17 As Möller notes, "[language is only one of the (albeit
the most central) means, through which meaning is
communicated]{.underline}". 18 Moreover, Williams emphasizes the
importance of images by stating that: "Security policies today are
constructed not only with the question of their linguistic legitimation
in mind; they now are increasingly decided upon in relation to
acceptable image-rhetorics." 19 [Addressing these criticisms, several
studies have examined the impact of other means of communication during
the securitization process.]{.underline} 20 In line with this, the dual
framework that is introduced in this article also takes different means
of communication into account in addition to speech acts.

In addition to images and other visual representations, Paris School
[scholars also emphasize the role of the practices of security
professionals,21 arguing that these play a more crucial role than
**discursive practices** in constructing security issues]{.underline}.22
That is, rather than the magical power of speech acts, it is the
institutionalizations and routinizations through repetitions of security
practices that produce security issues. 23 [Moreover, unlike the
Copenhagen School, scholars of the Paris School also focus on the
insecuritizing consequences of the process of securitization by asking
what security does rather than what security is.24 In this way, they
also inquire and focus on the threats that ordinary people face, like
the Welsh School does, with its Emancipatory Security
approach]{.underline}.25 However, the Paris School is also limited since
it overemphasizes micro-level practices and ignores macro-level
decisionmaking with its bottom-up framework.26 [My dual framework
borrows insights from the approach of the Paris School as it takes the
practices of security professionals into account without ignoring the
discursive impact of speech acts of macro-level decision-makers.
Moreover, it also focuses on the insecuritizing consequences of
securitization.]{.underline}

[Another significant limitation of Securitization Theory is the
**inadequate analysis** of the audience]{.underline}. According to
Thierry Balzacq, the role of the audience is underspecified because of
Wæver's reliance on John L. Austin's language theory.27 I [additionally
argue that the overemphasis on speech acts and under-analysis of the
audience(s) in the framework of Securitization Theory derives from the
tendency of the Copenhagen School scholars to see securitization as a
**universal phenomenon**]{.underline}. According to Balzacq, however,
"the success of securitization is highly contingent upon the
securitizing actor's ability to identify the audience's feelings, needs,
and interests...To persuade the audience, the speaker has to tune
his/her language to the audience's experience."28

[Securitization Theory also **fails to adequately analyze** contextual
issues. Balzacq, for example, claims that whereas Securitization Theory
claims that securitization modifies the external context, the opposite
is also true: the contextual issues and audience characteristics also
influence the process and success of securitization.29]{.underline}
According to Matt McDonald, "in developing a universal framework for the
designation or construction of threat through speech acts, the
Securitization Theory ultimately downplays the importance of contextual
factors."30 Attention to these two related limitations, concerning
audience and context, is essential to the dual securitization framework
too. However, I do not elaborate on these in this article since they
have already been discussed by various scholars, and many empirical
studies have already been conducted with a focus on these issues.31

Dillon and Reid's The Liberal Way of War: Killing to Make Life Live,
www.research.kobe-u.ac.jp/gsics-publication/jics/chandler_18-1.pdf

[This is a book about the 'liberal way of war']{.underline}. But [the
liberal referred to in the title remains under theorized]{.underline}.
On several occasions the authors highlight the distinction between the
liberal way of war and the general framing of war in the modern liberal
era as a geo-strategic contestation, taking the territorial state as its
referent object. For Dillon and Reid, 'liberalism never fitted this
model of modern politics and the modern problematization of war very
well'（p.83). They therefore seek to define liberalism and the liberal
way of war as distinct from war in the liberal era. **[The liberal way
of war refers not to real wars and conflicts but to an abstract model of
conflict]{.underline}**, defined as a desire to'remove war from the life
of humanity'which'derives from the way in which liberalism takes the
life of the species as its referent object of politics ─
biopolitics'（p.84）. [In this framing, the liberal nature of war very
much depends on the self-description of the conflict by its
proponents]{.underline}: these range from Gladstone's occupation of
Egypt in the cause of'suffering humanity', to US liberal ideological
constructions of the cause of'freedom'in the Cold War struggle against
the Soviet Union up to Bush and Blair's war on Iraq in the cause of
humanity（p.6）. As the authors state, of course, [wars may be fought on
other grounds than universal humanity: 'liberal states may...also act as
geopolitical sovereign actors as well...and may also have geopolitical
motives]{.underline} for the wars they wage'（p.84）.¶ **[It is clear
from the beginning that the distinctiveness of 'the liberal way of war'
which they seek to explore cannot be more than a fool's
quest]{.underline}**. They assert that they will critically uncover the
paradox of liberal war: why it is that Realist or geostrategic war
accepts the necessity of war but attempts to limit it, while liberals
wish to end war but, to do so, are willing to fight unlimited wars. Yet,
they admit that **[this starting point is already an ideological dead
end]{.underline}** [─ the wars of the twentieth century give the lie to
the idea that there is some distinction between 'unending crusades' and
'limited jousts between rationally calculative political subjects': war
has its own dynamic]{.underline}（p.7). [Nevertheless, Dillon and Reid
press on and seek to go beyond a Schmittian critique]{.underline} to
ground this paradox in the biopolitical'driver'of the liberal way of
rule ─ biopolitics: wars waged under the banner of the human（against
humans）are liberal and, allegedly biopolitical, as human life is
declared to be the referent in need of being secured. [These wars are
alleged to be fought differently to geo-political wars for territory,
because the 'drivers' of war are not territorialized interests but the
biopolitical framings of the needs of the human, how human life can and
should be lived.]{.underline} [Inevitably there are **insuperable
methodological hurdles** to this Sisyphusian task]{.underline}. Already,
[there occurs the first fundamental aporia: how do we tell the
difference between a liberal and non-liberal war?]{.underline} [There
appears to be no way of preventing the category of liberal war from
becoming a lifeless and descriptive one: wars are liberal and fought
biopolitically only if we are told that these are the motives by those
fighting them]{.underline}.¶ **[This separation of liberal ways of war
from territorialised framings of geostrategic contestation makes little
sense]{.underline}** [as a framework for understanding]{.underline}
either liberal rule or liberal ways of [war]{.underline}. In fact, [in
defining liberal war in this way the connection between liberal rule and
war is entirely severed]{.underline}. ['Liberal war may on occasions
also be geopolitical; which is to say that war may be simultaneously
geopolitical as well as biopolitically driven since the imperatives
behind war are never uniform or simple; but what distinguishes the
liberal way of war as liberal are the biopolitical imperatives which
have consistently driven its violent peace-making.'（p.85）Liberal rule
has also resulted in wars for territory or in defence of
territories]{.underline}; nevertheless, a story, of course, could have
been told about how views of the human fitted those of struggles to
command territory. [This is acknowledged, but sits uneasily with the
narrow view of liberal war for species life.]{.underline} If the racial
doctrines of European empires, up to and including the genocidal racism
of the Nazi regime, were also biopolitically driven ─ and the authors,
indeed, write of race as part of the'liberal biopolitics of the
seventeenth century'─ then [it seems difficult to separate a liberal way
of war from allegedly 'non-liberal' wars of territorial
control]{.underline}.¶ It seems clear that Dillon and Reid do not seek
to take the logical step of arguing that the view of the human reflects,
and is reflected by, how the human is ruled and how wars are both
thought and fought. Why? Because for them there is something
suprahistorically unique and distinct about the liberal way of war: a
distinctly liberal view which foregrounds the human as the referent of
security. Therefore, **[a second aporia arises: on what basis is this
specifically 'liberal'?]{.underline}** [It would appear that every form
of rule and of war has at least an implicit view of the 'human' and
through this view of the human the form of rule and the way of war are
rationalized. There is not and cannot be anything specifically 'liberal'
about this]{.underline}. The humanity in need of securing, through war
on other humans, could be formed by Alexander the Great's stoic
cosmopolitan vision, or could be'God's chosen people', 'the master
race', or 'the gains of the proletarian revolution': there is little
doubt that beliefs of what the human is, or could become, were a vital
part of many non-Liberal dispositifs ─ the discourses and practices - of
both rule and war. ¶ **[The key starting assumption, that the liberal
way of war can be isolated from any other - and]{.underline}** its
alleged specific form, of '**[unending violence', explained by its
referent of the human - appears to be]{.underline}** a **[particularly
unproductive]{.underline}** one. [At the level of abstraction at which
Dillon and Reid choose to work, there is very little here that would
help to distinguish between a liberal and a non-liberal way of
war]{.underline}（the asserted purpose of the book）. Of course, what
matters is what this view of the human is. Here [Dillon and
Reid]{.underline} appear to [recognise the limits of their
essentializing approach]{.underline}: ...just as the liberal way of rule
is constantly adapting and changing so also is the liberal way of war.
There is, in that sense, no one liberal way of rule or one liberal way
of war. But there is a fundamental continuity which justifies us
referring to the singular...the fact that each takes the properties of
species existence as its referent object...finding its expression

[Rather than understand our forms of post-political rule and

to what extent, if any, Foucault's conception of biopolitics may be of
assistance, [Dillon and Reid start out from the assumption that we live
in a liberal world of rule and war and that therefore both can be

his engagement with understanding the rise and transformation of liberal
forms of rule. [In transposing Foucault's critical engagement with

Constructivism helps to understand and navigate the complex ways in
which states as well as influential non-state actors engage with one
another, how they define themselves and others, and how these shape the
boundaries of the world within which they act.48 It helps explain how
norms based on common ideas and values can help promote security and
cooperation, and how significantly different ideologies can lead to
conflict. Constructivism goes a long way in explaining how individuals
and organizations influence policy decisions. [However, **constructivism
alone can't answer all** policy issues. There are **obvious gaps** that
require the application of **realist** and liberalist perspectives to
comprehend modern international relations]{.underline}.49 [**In today's
complex, ever-changing environment, no theory** is **comprehensive**
enough to stand alone]{.underline}.50 Policy makers and senior advisors
should consider the insights of each theory when articulating national
security policy. Conclusion [**Theory cannot claim primacy over
practice** and implementation, but its understanding is a useful
precursor for both]{.underline}. This is the central argument of this
examination. As senior advisors, how we choose to explain national
security issues inform the solutions we propose. Because national
security policy is important to the practice of military affairs, it is
paramount that senior military leaders develop a good understanding of
those aspects affecting policy formulation. [Improving this
understanding can **provide a stronger foundation** for senior military
leaders to engage more **effectively** with civilian leaders **on
defense-related policies**]{.underline}. [IR theory helps describe **how
policy makers** see the world and how **this influences policy
making**]{.underline}. [**Theory** influences their **perspectives** and
**inform** their **biases** and thus, deserve study and
analysis.]{.underline} Three predominant schools of thought attempt to
explain the way states behave: realism, liberalism, and constructivism.
In general terms, realism focuses on state power, typically in relation
to other states. For the United States, realist policies can translate
into hegemonic actions designed to maintain preeminence in the world.
Liberalism stresses the emphasis on democratic institutions and economic
interdependence. This can prompt policies designed to maximize
international cooperation through international bodies and trade at the
expense of defense-related capabilities. Constructivism highlights the
influence of shared norms, values, and ideas on state behavior.
Normative policies generally focused on establishing international rules
and norms of behavior states are expected to follow with heavy emphasis
in the diplomatic and legal arenas. [**Theory**, however, **is no
panacea**]{.underline}. [While these theories offer useful frameworks
with which to observe international relations, they tend to either
**overemphasize or underestimate attributes** in state behavior such as
the primacy of power, the importance of interdependence or the necessity
of norms]{.underline}. [Thus, policy making and subsequent execution
relying on **one theory** at the exclusion of others **is
risky**]{.underline}. Senior military officers and policy advisors
cannot be content with simply knowing what policy is. They must
understand what policy does and the mechanisms available to recommend
appropriate and effective policy. Having an understanding of how
perceptions of the world and state behavior affect policy decisions is a
way to do so. [In this regard, IR theory remains **essential** for
**understanding** world events, explaining their causes, assessing their
impacts, and proposing suitable solutions.]{.underline} As Snyder
suggests, "to use the insights of each of the three theoretical
traditions as a check on the irrational exuberance of the others."51
There is utility in theory, but it is the practitioners' role to
determine how they apply. Most importantly, it is the practitioner's job
to make the best use of them in order to advance national goals.

Transatlantic Divide: Why Securitization Has Not Secured a Place in
American IR, Why It Should, and How It Can," Duck of Minerva, 9-18-2015,

Securitization theory has rightly garnered much attention among European
scholars of international relations. Its basic claims are powerful: that
security threats are not given, but require active construction; that
the boundaries of "security" are malleable; that the declaration that a
certain problem lies within the realm of security is itself a productive
political act; and that "security" issues hold a trump card, demanding
disproportionate resources and silencing alternative perspectives.
Securitization thus highlights a familiar, even ubiquitous, political
process that had received little attention in the international
relations or comparative foreign policy literatures. It gave scholars a
theoretical language, if not quite a set of coherent theoretical tools,
with which to make sense of how a diverse set of issues, from migration
to narcotics flows to global climate change, sometimes came to be
treated as matters of national and global security and thereby---and
this is where securitization's critical edge came to the fore---impeded
reasoned political debate. No surprise that, as Jarrod and Eric observe,
securitization has been the focus of so many articles in the EJIR---and
even more in such journals as the Review of International Studies and
Security Dialogue. But [there are (good) substantive and]{.underline}
(not so good) [sociological reasons that **securitization has failed to
gain traction in North America**]{.underline}. First, and [most
important, securitization describes a process but leaves us well short
of (a) a fully specified causal theory that (b) takes proper account of
the politics of rhetorical contestation]{.underline}. According to the
foundational theorists of the Copenhagen School, actors, usually elites,
transform the social order from one of normal, everyday politics into a
Schmittian world of crisis by identifying a dire threat to the political
community. [They conceive of this "securitizing move" in linguistic
terms, as a speech act]{.underline}. As Ole Waever (1995: 55) argues,
"By saying it \[security\], something is done (as in betting, a promise,
naming a ship). . . . \[T\]he word 'security' is the act . . ."
\[emphasis added\]. Securitization is a powerful discursive process that
constitutes social reality. Countless articles and books have traced
this process, and its consequences, in particular policy domains.
[Securitization presents itself as a **causal** account. But its
**mechanisms remain obscure**, as do the **conditions** under which it
operates]{.underline}. Why is speaking security so powerful? [How do
mere words twist and transform the social order? Does the invocation of
security prompt a visceral emotional response? Are speech acts
persuasive, by using well-known tropes to convince audiences that they
must seek protection? Or does securitization operate through the
politics of rhetorical coercion, silencing potential opponents? In
securitization accounts, **speech acts** often seem to be **magical
incantations** that upend normal politics through pathways shrouded in
mystery]{.underline}. [Equally unclear is why **some** securitizing
moves resonate, while others \[are **ignored**\]]{.underline} ~~fall on
deaf ears~~. [Certainly not all attempts to construct threats
succeed]{.underline}, and this is true of both traditional military
concerns as well as "new" security issues. [Both neoconservatives and
structural realists in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[have long insisted that **conflict with China is inevitable**, yet
China has over the last **25 years** been more opportunity than threat
in US political discourse---**despite** these **vigorous and persistent
securitizing moves**]{.underline}. [In very recent years, the balance
has shifted, and the China threat has started to catch on: **linguistic
processes alone cannot account for this change**]{.underline}. The US
military has repeatedly declared that global climate change has profound
implications for national security---but that has hardly cast aside
climate change deniers, many of whom are ironically foreign policy hawks
supposedly deferential to the uniformed military. Authoritative speakers
have varied in the efficacy of their securitizing moves. While George W.
Bush powerfully framed the events of 9/11 as a global war against
American values, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a more gifted orator,
struggled to convince a skeptical public that Germany presented an
imminent threat to the United States. [After thirty years as an active
research program, securitization theory has **hardly begun to offer
acceptable answers** to these questions. **Brief references to
"facilitating conditions" won't cut it**. You don't have to subscribe to
a covering-law conception of theory to find these questions important or
to find securitization's answers unsatisfying]{.underline}. A large part
of the problem, we believe, lies in securitization's silence on the
politics of security. Its foundations in speech act theory have yielded
an oddly apolitical theoretical framework. In its seminal formulation,
the Copenhagen school emphasized the internal linguistic rules that must
be followed for a speech act to be recognized as competent. Yet as
Thierry Balzacq argues, [by treating securitization as a purely
rule-driven process]{.underline}, the Copenhagen school [ignores the
politics of securitization]{.underline}, reducing "security to a
conventional procedure such as marriage or betting in which the
'felicity circumstances' (conditions of success) must fully prevail for
the act to go through" (2005:172). [Absent from this picture are fierce
rhetorical battles, where coalitions counter securitizing moves with
their own appeals that strike more or less deeply at underlying
narratives. Absent as well are the public intellectuals and media, who
question and critique securitizing moves]{.underline} sometimes (and not
others), [sometimes to good effect (and sometimes with little
impact)]{.underline}. [The **audience** itself---whether the mass public
or a narrower elite stratum---is **stripped of all
agency**]{.underline}. [Speaking security, even when the performance is
competent, **does not sweep this politics away**]{.underline}. Only by
delving into this politics can we shed light on the mysteries of
securitization. We see rhetorical politics as constituted less by
singular "securitizing moves" than by "contentious conversation"---to
use Charles Tilly's phrase. To this end, we would urge securitization
theorists, as we recently have elsewhere, to move towards a "pragmatic"
model that rests on four analytical wagers: that actors are both
strategic and social; that legitimation works by imparting meaning to
political action; that legitimation is laced through with contestation;
and that the power of language emerges through contentious dialogue. We
are heartened that our ambivalence about securitization---the ways in
which we find it by turns appealing and dissatisfying---and our vision
for how to move forward have in the last decade been echoed by (mostly)
European colleagues. These critics have laid out a research agenda that
would, if taken up, produce more satisfying, and more deeply political,
theoretical accounts. In our own work, both individual and collective,
we have tried to advance that research agenda. So long as securitization
theorists resist defining the theory's scope and mechanisms, and so long
as it remains wedded to apolitical underpinnings, we think it unlikely
to gain a broad following on this side of the pond. [Second,
securitization has been held back by another way in which it is
apolitical]{.underline}---this time thanks to its Schmittian commitments
and political vision. [Successful securitization, in seminal accounts,
replaces normal patterns of politics with the world of the
exception]{.underline}, in which contest has no place. [They imagine
security as the ultimate trump card. But, in reality, the divide is not
nearly so stark. Security **does not crowd out all other spending
priorities**---or states would spend on nothing but defense and
"securitized" issues. **Nor** does simply declaring something a matter
of national security **guarantee its funding**]{.underline}---or global
climate change counter-measures, including research on renewable
energies, would be well-funded. [Nor are security issues somehow aloof
from politics: politics has never truly stopped "at the water's edge."
Securitization considers only the politics of security. Its strangely
dichotomous optic cannot see or make sense of the politics within
security]{.underline}. In ignoring the politics within security,
securitization is of course in good company. Realists of all stripes
have paid little attention to domestic political contest, except as a
distraction from structural imperatives. But while realism is
unquestionably a powerful first-cut, [this inattention to the politics
within security is also among the reasons so many have found it
wanting]{.underline}. As Arnold Wolfers long ago observed, some degree
of insecurity is the normal state of affairs. But "some may find the
danger to which they are exposed entirely normal and in line with their
modest security expectations while others consider it unbearable to live
with these same dangers." And states, he further argues, do not actually
maximize security---almost ever. "Even when there has been no question
that armaments would mean more security, the cost in taxes, the
reduction in social benefits, or the sheer discomfort involved have
militated effectively against further effort" (1962:151, 153). [A
securitization perspective renders all this politics within security
inexplicable. And yet]{.underline}, as Wolfers saw half a century ago,
[it is crucial]{.underline}.

Russia," Security Dialogue, 4-7-2017,

According to Buzan, Wæver and De Wilde's foundational text of the theory
of securitization, Security: A New Framework for Analysis (1998), [an
issue can be]{.underline} non-politicized (it is not subject to public
debate or policymaking), politicized (it is publicly debated and subject
to policymaking) or [securitized]{.underline} ([it is presented as an
existential threat, authorizing measures outside normal politics to
address it]{.underline}), and 'any issue can end up on any part of the
spectrum' (Buzan et al., 1998: 24). The Copenhagen School model outlines
that [for an issue to be repositioned from the status of non-politicized
or politicized to that of securitized requires an authorized and
responsible actor to name it as an existential security threat to a
particular referent object, and for this 'securitizing move' to be
accepted by the relevant audience of this referent object, the endorsing
of extraordinary measures to address it]{.underline}. In turn,
[desecuritizations are processes 'in which a political community
**downgrades** or **ceases to treat something as an existential threat**
to a valued referent object, and reduces or stops calling for
exceptional measures to deal with the threat']{.underline} (Buzan and
Wæver, cited in Coskun, 2008: 405).

As such, [the key aim of securitization theory is to identify what,
when, where and how an issue is moved from being part of the normal
environment of politics to becoming a threat to security and beyond the
scope of normal politics]{.underline} -- and vice versa
(desecuritization). The Copenhagen School securitization model gained
considerable popularity during the 2000s, and was applied to the
empirical study of a diverse range of security issues, including the War
on Terror (Buzan, 2006), immigration, trafficking and minority rights
(Huysmans, 1998, 2000; Aradau, 2004; Sasse, 2005; Jutila, 2006),
societal insecurity, human rights (Morozov, 2002), environmental
politics, HIV/AIDS (Elbe, 2006) and EU security (Huysmans, 2000;
Balzacq, 2008; Neal, 2009). However, it has also been the subject of a
series of critiques and modifications from both its staunch supporters
and ardent critics. As Ciută notes, this critique has three main
strands: conceptual (structural issues particularly related to speech
act theory and other necessary components of the model); epistemological
(how securitization views contexts); and normative (related to the shift
from securitization speech acts to practices of the political and the
liberal) (Ciută, 2009: 302).

In light of these critiques, a 'second-generation' research agenda
emerged among 'contextual securitization scholars' (Stritzel, 2012:
553), which is concerned with combining the formal aspects of the
securitization model with a greater emphasis on examining the
interrelationship between security politics and the contexts in which it
operates. The aim of this agenda is to 'construct a more comprehensive
understanding of underlying processes' by focusing on the
'socio-linguistic and/or socio-political micro-dynamics of generating
threats' (Stritzel, 2012: 553; see also Balzacq, 2005, 2011; Guzzini,
2011; Salter, 2008; Stritzel, 2007, 2011; McDonald, 2008, 2011).
Mirroring the original debate about the Copenhagen School model, the
initial focus of such second-generation scholarship centred on analysing
securitizing moves, while the inverse process of desecuritizing moves
did not receive much attention (Coskun, 2008: 393). Recently, however,
second-generation [scholars have begun to delve more deeply into what it
means to desecuritize an issue and ask what a desecuritized issue would
look like]{.underline} (see Åtland, 2008; Aradau, 2004; Aras and Polat,
2008; Behnke, 2006; Cui and Li, 2011; Hansen, 2012; Knudsen, 2001; Roe,
2004; Wæver, 1995; Oelsner, 2005; Coskun, 2008; Salter, 2008; Klinke and
Perombelon 2015).

[These efforts have revealed a **lack of basic consensus** on the nature
of desecuritization as a concept, model or process]{.underline}. As
Coskun rightly points out, 'the Copenhagen School does not suggest an
explicit framework for its analysis as it has done for securitization';
'[different scholars have **interpreted** and **implied**
desecuritization **differently**]{.underline}' (Coskun, 2008: 395). [The
notion that to analyse desecuritization is simply to follow the
Copenhagen School securitization model, but in reverse, has **proven
problematic**]{.underline}. Åtland (2008: 292) argues that, as opposed
to securitization, '[desecuritization **does not necessarily happen** as
the result of a "speech act". Rather, there are many other ways that an
issue or issue-area can be moved out of the sphere of security politics
and into the sphere of regular politics'. For many scholars,
desecuritizing moves have come to be considered as the product of a
**wider management process**, rather than a **singular speech act or
debate**]{.underline} (for more on this debate, see Roe, 2004, 2006;
Jutila, 2006).

New Dual Framework," Uluslararasi Iliskiler, 7-1-2020,

[In addition, by focusing on the illocutionary act, securitization is
presented as happening within a single moment rather than as a process
over time]{.underline}. Ole Wæver, for example, argues "the utterance
itself is the act ... by uttering security, a state representative moves
a particular development into a specific area, and thereby claims a
special right to use whatever means to block it."37 [That is,
securitization occurs just within the moment when the speech act is
performed, and the audience has accepted it]{.underline}.38 Although
this Schmittian stance has somewhat changed in the 1998 book39 by
focusing on the securitizing move and the inherent processual nature of
persuasion of the audience, the processual understanding of
securitization is still limited. Still, in this framework of the
Copenhagen School (successful) securitization ends with the persuasion
of a sufficient number of right people and the start of the
extraordinary measures.40 However[, I argue that securitization should
be considered as a process that includes the definition of security,
discursive efforts to convince the audience, security practices that
normalize and routinize the security definition, the clashes between
rival security definitions and arguments, and the insecurities that
result from these security practices.]{.underline} I further argue that
securitization lasts until the issue is fully desecuritized[. It can
further be argued that securitization and desecuritization may occur
simultaneously; some groups may be struggling to securitize an issue,
while others may be working for its desecuritization.]{.underline}

[The main shortcoming of Securitization Theory relevant for the argument
of this study is the lack of the analysis of rival voices]{.underline}.
[Securitization is considered as truth construction]{.underline}. That
is, the Securitizing actor proposes a truth claim and convinces
audiences of this claim. The securitizing actor proposes a security
definition in which s/he describes the threat, legitimate security
provider, referent object, and legitimate means to deal with the issue[.
However, there are always rivals who reject this truth claim or, in most
cases, counter truth claims, and definitions emerge.]{.underline} This a
constant conflict between these truth claims, while constructing
security issues means that a securitization analysis should also examine
these rival voices. [These rival voices may take the form of non-violent
opposition or counter-securitization. To overcome this limitation, a
dual approach is required to examine rival voices in the securitization
process.]{.underline}

[The lack of a dual approach in Securitization Theory means that a
securitization analysis can only problematize one side, namely that of
the securitizing actors, by revealing how they create security issues
and use security discourses to achieve their own aims. In most cases,
this actor is the state or other formal institutions like the
EU.]{.underline} In most cases, however, particularly when
counter-securitization emerges, other securitizing actors are involved
that should also be problematized. These may also use extraordinary or
violent means like the use of force. For example, in the securitization
of a minority group in a country, the state may be the securitizing
actor, which uses extraordinary means as a result of a securitization
process. [However, there may also be a counter-securitization against
the state from within this minority group, and this securitizing actor
may also be using extraordinary means against the state like the use of
force. The sequence of the primary and counter-securitization may also
change. Hence, both primary and counter-securitizations should be
investigated in a comprehensive securitization analysis. However, it
should be stated that there does not have to be a countersecuritization
in all securitization cases. There may also be non-violent opposition
depending on the contextual factors, but I argue that there are always
rival voices in line with the argument of Foucault that "where there is
power there is resistance."41]{.underline}

de Janeir

Marcelo de Araujo, "Moral Enhancement and Political Realism," Journal of
Evolution and Technology, 6-xx-2014, https://jetpress.org/v24/araujo.htm

Some [moral enhancement theorists argue]{.underline} that [a society of
**morally enhanced individuals**]{.underline} [would be in a better
position to cope with important problems that humankind is likely to
face in]{.underline} the future such as, for instance, the threats posed
by **[climate change]{.underline}**, grand scale **[terrorist
attacks]{.underline}**, or the risk of **[catastrophic
wars.]{.underline}** [The assumption here is]{.underline} quite simple:
[our inability to cope successfully with these problems stems mainly
from a sort of deficit in human beings' **moral
motivation**]{.underline}. [If human beings were morally
better]{.underline} -- if we had enhanced moral dispositions -- [there
would be **fewer wars, less terrorism**, and more **willingness to save
our environment**.]{.underline} Although simple and attractive, **[this
assumption is]{.underline}**, as I intend to show,
**[false]{.underline}**. [At the root of threats to the survival of
humankind in the future is not a deficit in our moral
dispositions]{.underline}, [but the endurance of an **old political
arrangement** that prevents the pursuit of shared goals on a collective
basis.]{.underline} The political arrangement I have in mind here is the
international system of states. In my analysis of the political
implications of moral enhancement, I intend to concentrate my attention
only on the supposition that we could avoid major wars in the future by
making individuals morally better. I do not intend to discuss the
threats posed by climate change, or by terrorism, although some human
enhancement theorists also seek to cover these topics. I will explain,
in the course of my analysis, a conceptual distinction between "human
nature realism" and "structural realism," well-known in the field of
international relations theory. Thomas Douglas seems to have been among
the first to explore the idea of "moral enhancement" as a new form of
human enhancement. He certainly helped to kick off the current phase of
the debate. In a paper published in 2008, Douglas suggests that in the
"future people might use biomedical technology to morally enhance
themselves." Douglas characterizes moral enhancement in terms of the
acquisition of "morally better motives" (Douglas 2008, 229). Mark
Walker, in a paper published in 2009, suggests a similar idea. He
characterizes moral enhancement in terms of improved moral dispositions
or "genetic virtues": The Genetic Virtue Program (GVP) is a proposal for
influencing our moral nature through biology, that is, it is an
alternate yet complementary means by which ethics and ethicists might
contribute to the task of making our lives and world a better place. The
basic idea is simple enough: genes influence human behavior, so altering
the genes of individuals may alter the influence genes exert on
behavior. (Walker 2009, 27--28) Walker does not argue in favor of any
specific moral theory, such as, for instance, virtue ethics. Whether one
endorses a deontological or a utilitarian approach to ethics, he argues,
the concept of virtue is relevant to the extent that virtues motivate us
either to do the right thing or to maximize the good (Walker 2009, 35).
Moral enhancement theory, however, does not reduce the ethical debate to
the problem of moral dispositions. Morality also concerns, to a large
extent, questions about reasons for action. And moral enhancement, most
certainly, will not improve our moral beliefs; neither could it be used
to settle moral disagreements. This seems to have led some authors to
criticize the moral enhancement idea on the ground that it neglects the
cognitive side of our moral behavior. Robert Sparrow, for instance,
argues that, from a Kantian point of view, moral enhancement would have
to provide us with better moral beliefs rather than enhanced moral
motivation (Sparrow 2014, 25; see also Agar 2010, 74). Yet, it seems to
me that this objection misses the point of the moral enhancement idea.
[Many people, across different countries, already share moral beliefs
relating]{.underline}, for instance, [to the wrongness of harming or
killing other people arbitrarily,]{.underline} or to the moral
requirement to help people in need. They may share moral beliefs while
not sharing the same reasons for these beliefs, or perhaps even not
being able to articulate the beliefs in the conceptual framework of a
moral theory (Blackford 2010, 83). But although they share some moral
beliefs, in some circumstances they may lack the appropriate motivation
to act accordingly. Moral enhancement, thus, aims at improving moral
motivation, and leaves open the question as to how to improve our moral
judgments. In a recent paper, published in The Journal of Medical
Ethics, neuroscientist Molly Crockett reports the state of the art in
the still very embryonic field of moral enhancement. She points out, for
example, that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
citalopram seems to increase harm aversion. There is, moreover, some
evidence that this substance may be effective in the treatment of
specific types of aggressive behavior. Like Douglas, Crockett emphasizes
that moral enhancement should aim at individuals' moral motives
(Crockett 2014; see also Spence 2008; Terbeck et al. 2013). Another
substance that is frequently mentioned in the moral enhancement
literature is oxytocin. Some [studies suggest that willingness to
cooperate with other people]{.underline},and to trust unknown
prospective cooperators, [may be enhanced by an increase in the levels
of oxytoci]{.underline}n in the organism (Zak 2008, 2011; Zak and Kugler
2011; Persson and Savulescu 2012, 118--119). Oxytocin has also been
reported to be "associated with the subjective experience of empathy"
(Zak 2011, 55; Zak and Kugler 2011, 144). The question I would like to
examine now concerns the supposition that moral enhancement --
comprehended in these terms and assuming for the sake of argument that,
some day, it might become effective and safe -- may also help us in
coping with the threat of devastating wars in the future. [The
assumption that there is a relationship between,]{.underline} on the one
hand, [threats to the survival of humankind and]{.underline}, on the
other, [a sort of "deficit" in our moral dispositions is
c]{.underline}learly [made by]{.underline} some [moral enhancements
theorists]{.underline}. Douglas, for instance, argues that "according to
many plausible theories, some of the world's most important problems ---
such as developing world poverty, climate change and war --- can be
attributed to these moral deficits" (2008, 230). Walker, in a similar
vein, writes about the possibility of "using biotechnology to alter our
biological natures in an effort to reduce evil in the world" (2009, 29).
And Julian Savulescu and Ingmar Persson go as far as to defend the "the
need for moral enhancement" of humankind in a series of articles, and in
a book published in 2012. One of the reasons Savulescu and Persson
advance for the moral enhancement of humankind is that our moral
dispositions seem to have remained basically unchanged over the last
millennia (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 2). These dispositions have
proved thus far quite useful for the survival of human beings as a
species. They have enabled us to cooperate with each other in the
collective production of things such as food, shelter, tools, and
farming. They have also played a crucial role in the creation and
refinement of a variety of human institutions such as settlements,
villages, and laws. Although the possibility of free-riding has never
been fully eradicated, the benefits provided by cooperation have largely
exceeded the disadvantages of our having to deal with occasional
uncooperative or untrustworthy individuals (Persson and Savulescu 2012,
39). The problem, however, is that the same dispositions that have
enabled human beings in the past to engage in the collective production
of so many artifacts and institutions now seem powerless in the face of
the human capacity to destroy other human beings on a grand scale, or
perhaps even to annihilate the entire human species. There is, according
to Savulescu and Persson, a "mismatch" between our cognitive faculties
and our evolved moral attitudes: "\[...\] as we have repeatedly
stressed, owing to the progress of science, the range of our powers of
action has widely outgrown the range of our spontaneous moral attitudes,
and created a dangerous mismatch" (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 103; see
also Persson and Savulescu 2010, 660; Persson and Savulescu 2011b;
DeGrazie 2012, 2; Rakić 2014, 2). This worry about the mismatch between,
on the one hand, the modern technological capacity to destroy and, on
the other, our limited moral commitments is not new. The political
philosopher Hans Morgenthau, best known for his defense of political
realism, called attention to the same problem nearly fifty years ago. In
the wake of the first successful tests with thermonuclear bombs,
conducted by the USA and the former Soviet Union, Morgenthau referred to
the "contrast" between the technological progress of our age and our
feeble moral attitudes as one of the most disturbing dilemmas of our
time: The first dilemma consists in the contrast between the
technological unification of the world and the parochial moral
commitments and political institutions of the age. Moral commitments and
political institutions, dating from an age which modern technology has
left behind, have not kept pace with technological achievements and,
hence, are incapable of controlling their destructive potentialities.
(Morgenthau 1962, 174) Moral enhancement theorists and political
realists like Morgenthau, therefore, share the thesis that our natural
moral dispositions are not strong enough to prevent human beings from
endangering their own existence as a species. But they differ as to the
best way out of this quandary: moral enhancement theorists argue for the
re-engineering of our moral dispositions, whereas Morgenthau accepted
the immutability of human nature and argued, instead, for the
re-engineering of world politics. Both positions, as I intend to show,
are wrong in assuming that the "dilemma" results from the weakness of
our spontaneous moral dispositions in the face of the unprecedented
technological achievements of our time. On the other hand, [both
positions are correct in recognizing the **real possibility** of global
catastrophes resulting from the malevolent use of, for instance,
**biotechnology or nuclear capabilities.**]{.underline} The supposition
that individuals' unwillingness to cooperate with each other, even when
they would be better-off by choosing to cooperate, results from a sort
of deficit of dispositions such as altruism, empathy, and benevolence
has been at the core of some important political theories. This idea is
an important assumption in the works of early modern political realists
such as Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes. It was also later endorsed by
some well-known authors writing about the origins of war in the first
half of the twentieth century. It was then believed, as Sigmund Freud
suggested in a text from 1932, that the main cause of wars is a human
tendency to "hatred and destruction" (in German: ein Trieb zum Hassen
und Vernichtung). [Freud went as far as to suggest that human beings
have an ingrained "inclination" to "aggression" and
"destruction"]{.underline} (Aggressionstrieb, Aggressionsneigung, and
Destruktionstrieb), and that this inclination has a "good biological
basis" (biologisch wohl begründet) (Freud 1999, 20--24; see also Freud
1950; Forbes 1984; Pick 1993, 211--227; Medoff 2009). The [attempt to
employ Freud's conception of human nature in understanding international
relations has recently been resumed]{.underline}, for instance by Kurt
Jacobsen in a paper entitled "Why Freud Matters: Psychoanalysis and
International Relations Revisited," published in 2013. Morgenthau
himself was deeply influenced by Freud's speculations on the origins of
war.1 Early in the 1930s, Morgenthau wrote an essay called "On the
Origin of the Political from the Nature of Human Beings" (Über die
Herkunft des Politischen aus dem Wesen des Menschen), which contains
several references to Freud's theory about the human propensity to
aggression.2 Morgenthau's most influential book, Politics among Nations:
The Struggle for Power and Peace, first published in 1948 and then
successively revised and edited, is still considered a landmark work in
the tradition of political realism. According to Morgenthau, politics is
governed by laws that have their origin in human nature: "Political
realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by
objective laws that have their roots in human nature" (Morgenthau 2006,
4). Just like human enhancement theorists, Morgenthau also takes for
granted that human nature has not changed over recent millennia: "Human
nature, in which the laws of politics have their roots, has not changed
since the classical philosophies of China, India, and Greece endeavored
to discover these laws" (Morgenthau 2006, 4). And since, for Morgenthau,
human nature prompts human beings to act selfishly, rather than
cooperatively, political leaders will sometimes favor conflict over
cooperation, unless some superior power compels them to act otherwise.
Now, this is exactly what happens in the domain of international
relations. For in the international sphere there is not a supranational
institution with the real power to prevent states from pursuing means of
self-defense. The acquisition of means of self-defense, however, is
frequently perceived by other states as a threat to their own security.
This leads to the security dilemma and the possibility of war. As
Morgenthau put the problem in an article published in 1967: "The actions
of states are determined not by moral principles and legal commitments
but by considerations of interest and power" (1967, 3). Because
Morgenthau and early modern political philosophers such as Machiavelli
and Hobbes defended political realism on the grounds provided by a
specific conception human nature, their version of political realism has
been frequently called "human nature realism." The literature on human
nature realism has become quite extensive (Speer 1968; Booth 1991;
Freyberg-Inan 2003; Kaufman 2006; Molloy 2006, 82--85; Craig 2007;
Scheuerman 2007, 2010, 2012; Schuett 2007; Neascu 2009; Behr 2010,
210--225; Brown 2011; Jütersonke 2012). It is not my intention here to
present a fully-fledged account of the tradition of human nature
realism, but rather to emphasize the extent to which some moral
enhancement theorists, in their description of some of the gloomy
scenarios humankind is likely to face in the future, implicitly endorse
this kind of political realism. Indeed, like human nature realists,
moral enhancement theorists assume that human nature has not changed
over the last millennia, and that violence and lack of cooperation in
the international sphere result chiefly from human nature's limited
inclination to pursue morally desirable goals. One may, of course,
criticize the human enhancement project by rejecting the assumption that
conflict and violence in the international domain should be explained by
means of a theory about human nature. In a reply to Savulescu and
Persson, [Sparrow correctly argues that **"structural issues,"** rather
than **human nature**, constitute the main factor underlying political
conflicts]{.underline} (Sparrow 2014, 29). But he does not explain what
exactly these "structural issues" are, as I intend to do later. Sparrow
is right in rejecting the human nature theory underlying the human
enhancement project. But this underlying assumption, in my view, is not
trivially false or simply "ludicrous," as he suggests. Human nature
realism has been implicitly or explicitly endorsed by leading political
philosophers ever since Thucydides speculated on the origins of war in
antiquity (Freyberg-Inan 2003, 23--36). True, it might be objected that
"human nature realism," as it was defended by Morgenthau and earlier
political philosophers, relied upon a metaphysical or psychoanalytical
conception of human nature, a conception that, actually, did not have
the support of any serious scientific investigation (Smith 1983, 167).
Yet, over the last few years there has been much empirical research in
fields such as developmental psychology and evolutionary biology that
apparently gives some support to the realist claim. Some of these
studies suggest that an inclination to aggression and conflict has its
origins in our evolutionary history. This idea, then, has recently led
some authors to resume "human nature realism" on new foundations, devoid
of the metaphysical assumptions of the early realists, and entirely
grounded in empirical research. Indeed, some recent works in the field
of international relations theory already seek to call attention to
evolutionary biology as a possible new start for political realism. This
point is clearly made, for instance, by Bradley Thayer, who published in
2004 a book called Darwin and International Relations: On the
Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict. And in a paper
published in 2000, he affirms the following: Evolutionary theory
provides a stronger foundation for realism because it is based on
science, not on theology or metaphysics. I use the theory to explain two
human traits: egoism and domination. I submit that the egoistic and
dominating behavior of individuals, which is commonly described as
"realist," is a product of the evolutionary process. I focus on these
two traits because they are critical components of any realist argument
in explaining international politics. (Thayer 2000, 125; see also Thayer
2004) Thayer basically argues that a tendency to egoism and domination
stems from human evolutionary history. The predominance of conflict and
competition in the domain of international politics, he argues, is a
reflex of dispositions that can now be proved to be part of our evolved
human nature in a way that Morgenthau and other earlier political
philosophers could not have established in their own time. Now, what
some moral enhancement theorists propose is a direct intervention in our
"evolved limited moral psychology" as a means to make us "fit" to cope
with some possible devastating consequences from the predominance of
conflict and competition in the domain of international politics
(Persson and Savulescu 2010, 664). Moral enhancement theorists
comprehend the nature of war and conflicts, especially those conflicts
that humankind is likely to face in the future, as the result of human
beings' limited moral motivations. Compared to supporters of human
nature realism, however, moral enhancement theorists are less skeptical
about the prospect of our taming human beings' proclivity to do evil.
For our knowledge in fields such as neurology and pharmacology does
already enable us to enhance people's performance in a variety of
activities, and there seems to be no reason to assume it will not enable
us to enhance people morally in the future. But [the
question]{.underline}, of course, is [whether moral enhancement
will]{.underline} also [improve the prospect of our coping
successfully]{.underline} [with]{.underline} some major threats to the
**[survival of humankind]{.underline}**, as Savulescu and Persson
propose, or **[to reduce evil in the world]{.underline}**, as proposed
by Walker. V. The point to which I would next like to call attention is
that "human nature realism" -- which is implicitly presupposed by some
moral enhancement theorists -- has been much criticized over the last
decades within the tradition of political realism itself. "Structural
realism," unlike "human nature realism," does not seek to derive a
theory about conflicts and violence in the context of international
relations from a theory of the moral shortcomings of human nature.
Structural realism was originally proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the
State and War, published in 1959, and then later in another book called
Theory of International Politics, published in 1979. In both works,
Waltz seeks to avoid committing himself to any specific conception of
human nature (Waltz 2001, x--xi). Waltz's thesis is that the thrust of
the political realism doctrine can be retained without our having to
commit ourselves to any theory about the shortcomings of human nature.
What is relevant for our understanding of international politics is,
instead, our understanding of the "structure" of the international
system of states (Waltz 1986). John Mearsheimer, too, is an important
contemporary advocate of political realism. Although he seeks to
distance himself from some ideas defended by Waltz, he also rejects
human nature realism and, like Waltz, refers to himself as a supporter
of "structural realism" (Mearsheimer 2001, 20). One of the basic tenets
of political realism (whether "human nature realism" or "structural
realism") is, first, that the [states are the]{.underline} main, if not
the **[only, relevant actors]{.underline}** in the context of
international relations; [and]{.underline} second, that states
**[compete for power]{.underline}** in the international arena. **[Moral
considerations]{.underline}** in international affairs, according to
realists, [are **secondary**]{.underline} [when set against the state's
primary goal]{.underline}, **[namely its own security and
survival]{.underline}**. But while human nature realists such as
Morgenthau explain the struggle for power as a result of human beings'
natural inclinations, structural realists like Waltz and Mearsheimer
argue that conflicts in the international arena do not stem from human
nature, but from the very "structure" of the international system of
states (Mearsheimer 2001, 18). According to Waltz and Mearsheimer, [it
is this **structure** that compels individuals to act as they do in the
domain of international affairs.]{.underline} And one distinguishing
feature of the international system of states is [its "anarchical
structure,"]{.underline} i.e. the lack of a central government analogous
to the central governments that exist in the context of domestic
politics. [It means that each individual state is responsible for its
own integrity and survival]{.underline}. [In the absence of a superior
authority]{.underline}, over and above the power of each sovereign
state, [political leaders]{.underline} often [feel compelled to favor
**security over morality**]{.underline}, even if, all other things being
considered, they would naturally be more inclined to trust and to
cooperate with political leaders of other states. On the other hand,
when political leaders do trust and cooperate with other states, it is
not necessarily their benevolent nature that motivates them to be
cooperative and trustworthy, but, again, it is the structure of the
system of states that compels them. The concept of human nature, as we
can see, does not play a decisive role here. Because Waltz and
Mearsheimer depart from "human nature realism," their version of
political realism has also sometimes been called "neo-realism" (Booth
1991, 533). Thus, **[even if]{.underline}** [human beings turn out to
become **morally enhanced**]{.underline} in the future, [humankind may
still have to face the same **scary scenarios**]{.underline} described
by some moral enhancement theorists. [This is likely to happen if,
indeed]{.underline}, [human beings remain compelled to
cooperate]{.underline} within the present structure of the system of
states. Consider, for instance, the incident with a Norwegian weather
rocket in January 1995. Russian radars detected a missile that was
initially suspected of being on its way to reach Moscow in five minutes.
All levels of Russian military defense were immediately put on alert for
a possible imminent attack and massive retaliation. It is reported that
for the first time in history a Russian president had before him, ready
to be used, the "nuclear briefcase" from which the permission to launch
nuclear weapons is issued. And that happened when the Cold War was
already supposed to be over! In the event, it was realized that the
rocket was leaving Russian territory and Boris Yeltsin did not have to
enter the history books as the man who started the third world war by
mistake (Cirincione 2008, 382).3 But [under the crushing pressure of
having to decide in such a short time, and on the basis of unreliable
information, whether or not to retaliate, even a morally enhanced
Yeltsin might have given orders to launch a devastating nuclear
response]{.underline} -- and that **[in spite of strong moral
dispositions to the contrary.]{.underline}** Writing for The Guardian on
the basis of recently declassified documents, Rupert Myers reports
further incidents similar to the one of 1995. He suggests that as more
states strive to acquire nuclear capability, the danger of a major
nuclear accident is likely to increase (Myers 2014). [What has to be
changed]{.underline}, therefore, [is not human moral
dispositions]{.underline}, **[but the very structure of the political
international system of states]{.underline}** within which we currently
live. As far as major threats to the survival of humankind are
concerned, moral enhancement might play an important role in the future
only to the extent that it will help humankind to change the structure
of the system of states. While [moral enhancement]{.underline} may
possibly have desirable results in some areas of human cooperation that
do not badly threaten our security -- such as donating food, medicine,
and money to poorer countries -- it [will not motivate political leaders
to **dismantle their nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. [Neither will it
deter other political leaders from pursuing nuclear
capability]{.underline}, [at any rate not as long as the structure of
international politics compels them to see prospective cooperators **in
the present as possible enemies in the future.**]{.underline} The idea
of a "structure" should not be understood here in metaphysical terms, as
though it mysteriously existed in a transcendent world and had the
magical power of determining leaders' decisions in this world. The word
"structure" denotes merely a political arrangement in which there are no
powerful law-enforcing institutions. And [in the absence of the kind of
security that law-enforcing institutions have the force to
create]{.underline}, [political leaders will]{.underline} often **[fail
to cooperate,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} occasionally [engage
in]{.underline} conflicts and [wars]{.underline}, [in those areas that
are critical to their]{.underline} security and [survival]{.underline}.
Given the structure of international politics and the basic goal of
survival, [this is likely to continue to happen]{.underline}, **[even
if,]{.underline}** in the future, political [leaders become **less
egoistic and power-seeking**]{.underline} through moral enhancement. On
the other hand, since the structure of the international system of
states is itself another human institution, there is no reason to
suppose that it cannot ever be changed. If people become morally
enhanced in the future they may possibly feel more strongly motivated to
change the structure of the system of states, or perhaps even feel
inclined to abolish it altogether. In my view, however, [addressing
major threats to the survival of humankind in the future by means of
**bioengineering**]{.underline} [is unlikely to yield the **expected
results**, so long as moral enhancement is pursued **within the present
framework of the international system of states.**]{.underline}

**Tatum 18** -- Assistant Professor in the Department of Political
Science at Francis Marion University

Dillon Tatum, "Toward a Radical IR," Duck of Minerva, 11-28-2018,
http://duckofminerva.com/2018/11/toward-a-radical-ir.html

David Brook's latest column in the New York Times, banging on the same
themes about "the kids are just not right," raises some questions about
[what it means to engage in radical politics in the Trump
era]{.underline}. Brooks compares [the]{.underline} younger generation's
[belief "that the system itself is rotten and needs to be **torn
down**"]{.underline} to accomodationist and gradualisms. He continues on
to speculate about how these new attitudes might affect older, more
"pragmatic," liberals who desire to work within the system. Brooks, as
usual, uses a conservative argument to position himself in the "middle."
[I have been thinking]{.underline} a lot [about this issue of
**"radicalism"** contra arguments about **working within systems** that
are unjust in thinking about liberal world order and its
futures]{.underline}. It has led me to a question [I am]{.underline}
currently [exploring]{.underline} in a work-in-progress about what [the
possibilities]{.underline} are [of radicalism as a way of approaching
international politics]{.underline}. Against arguments like Brooks', and
even more sophisticated arguments about agonistic democracy developed by
thinkers like Chantal Mouffe, I think [there is a **place in IR** for
radical conceptions of transformation, order, and politics]{.underline}.
[What is radicalism?]{.underline} Brooks never fully fleshes out this
concept. [Philosophy and political theory have engaged with the issue of
radicalism as a concept, though the results are often
divergent]{.underline}. To quote Agnes Heller, in her treatise on
[radical philosophy]{.underline}, it "[can give the world a norm, and it
can will people to want to give a world to the norm]{.underline}."
[Radicalism as an idea, and as a form of critique, mobilizes many
different modes of thinking about the social and the
political]{.underline}. The most comprehensive definition of radicalism
is that provided by Paul [McLaughlin]{.underline}, who [defines
radicalism]{.underline} "[in terms of]{.underline} (i) [a fundamental
orientation]{.underline} (toward fundamental objects) (ii) [in the
political domain]{.underline} (iii) [of an argumentative
nature]{.underline}." More than that, though, we can add that
[radicalism intervenes in the political domain with the goal of
fundamental transformation]{.underline}. Additionally, [though
radicalism]{.underline} indeed [proceeds in an **argumentative nature**,
this methodology for argument is one that is aimed at critiquing, and
seeking the destruction/replacement of existing
institutions]{.underline}. [A revised]{.underline} working [definition
of radicalism]{.underline}, therefore, [is: a way of thinking about
politics that focuses on totalities, **praxis** and **political
action**, and the deployment of historicist methods with an eye toward
"getting to the root of things."]{.underline} Thus, [radicalism is both
a broad range of critical thought and practice, but also is specific in
the realms of focus, **action**, and method]{.underline}. If Brooks is
right that there is a major clash between a radical younger generation
and a more pragmatic and moderate older generation in American politics,
these differences are not well expressed in contemporary thinking about
IR. [Some of the biggest divisions are between]{.underline} what Robert
Cox called **["problem-solving theories"]{.underline}** [and theories
that **critique** such approaches, but provide little argumentation
aimed at tearing structures of injustice down altogether]{.underline}.
[In short: IR, **even at its critical ends**, **is not
radical**]{.underline} (for an excellent exception see here and here).
[Why is this important?]{.underline} This morning, I taught a seminar on
the question "Is Liberal World Order Finished?" [I asked my students to
think about what makes a liberal order "liberal," and then asked: "Can
we fix the liberal world order, or can we imagine a world without
it**?**]{.underline}---[and **what would that look like?**]{.underline}"
[The students were quick to point out the violences, inequities, and
problems inherent in a liberal world order, **but**]{.underline} [it
took a good bit of pushing and prodding to get them to articulate
**whether**/**how** we **should**/**could** take this order apart and
rethink it]{.underline}. [This was not just a difficult task for the
students---it is something IR has not spent enough time meditating
on]{.underline}. [There is a lot to be critical of these
days]{.underline}. And, I disagree with Brooks's pessimism about a
younger radical generation. [Politics is deeply intertwined with
engagements with radicalism]{.underline}. [What]{.underline} I think [is
**missing**]{.underline} [when we consider global politics]{.underline},
though, [is that many of our pressing questions about institutions,
order, and state action proceed from the same sort of moderation,
accomodationism, or---at the most---an immanently critical
vein]{.underline}. If [we want to intellectually and politically
approach issues]{.underline} like: **[What do we make of the future(s)
of liberal world order?]{.underline}** IR needs to engage with
radicalism.

## Link Defense/Turns

**[2AC\-\--Russia Securitization Good]{.underline}**

**Russia is a geostrategic threat and labelling them as such is
essential to maintain NATO cohesion and credibility\-\--failure leads to
deterrence collapse and Russian expansion**

**McInnis and Fata 22** -- Senior fellow in the International Security
Program and the director of the Smart Women, Smart Power Initiative at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Former U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of defense and a nonresident senior advisor at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies

Kathleen J. McInnis and Daniel Fata, \"Russia Still Threatens NATO
Despite Military Failings,\" Foreign
Policy, 5-20-2022, https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/20/russia-threat-nato-madrid-summit/?tpcc=recirc_latestanalysis062921

Recent events in Ukraine have once again proved that reports of NATO's
death are an exaggeration. Many leaders across the alliance have been
quick to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with aid to Kyiv,
increases in their own country's defense budgets, or both. But [as the
war grinds on and the **geopolitical reality** of an **adversarial
relationship** with Russia sets in, NATO must once again take the
**longer view** on]{.underline} what all this means for [trans-Atlantic
and global security.]{.underline}

Conveniently, in less than two months, NATO leaders will meet in Madrid
to endorse the alliance's new strategy. The key question, therefore, is
whether member states will use the moment to reforge NATO's raison
d'être to meet current and future challenges---in particular, by naming
Russia as a threat to the alliance itself. Given the implications of
Ukraine for European and global order, **[the stakes could hardly be
higher.]{.underline}**

[Some take the view that Madrid should mark a reprioritization of U.S.
efforts away from Europe]{.underline} and back toward Asia. Their logic
goes that not only is European defense spending increasing, but Russia
has also demonstrated ineptitude in the prosecution of its war in
Ukraine. That means the longer-term need for significant U.S. forces in
Europe has also therefore declined. And, after all, China is the pacing
threat for Department of Defense planning.

[In fact, **the opposite is true**.]{.underline} For starters, Russian
President Vladimir [Putin has made it **abundantly clear** that **he
views NATO** as a **strategic threat**. Recent events suggest we should
**take these statements** **at face value**. In the runup to the current
war, some analysts developed **elaborate rationales** for why the
buildup of Russian forces]{.underline} on the Ukrainian border [didn't
mean]{.underline} an [invasion]{.underline} was coming, such as a
strengthened negotiating position vis-à-vis Ukraine's future political
directions. [Another Russian invasion of Ukraine was **so**
**obviously** strategically counterproductive that there must have been
another reason for the buildup. **In the event, there
wasn't.**]{.underline}

And [while Russian military incompetence has been startling, planners
**shouldn't leap to conclusions**. Russian forces]{.underline} were not
able to capture Kyiv, but they [have been able to seize tens of
thousands of square miles of territory]{.underline} along Ukraine's
eastern border---at least for now. [Estonia]{.underline}, a Baltic NATO
member that borders Russia, [is less than 20,000 square
miles]{.underline} in size. [Militaries can also reform]{.underline},
especially after disaster, as Ukraine's own army did after its failures
in 2014.

[The United States has **good reasons** to want to **keep NATO
vibrant**: The **strategic benefits** of U.S. leadership are
**manifold**. Not only does American leadership]{.underline} in NATO
[provide pathways for **organizing military coalitions**, but it also
affords the United States privileged status on **trade partnerships**
and **access to bases**. If Putin **achieves his aim** of **discrediting
NATO**, this could lead to trans-Atlantic **strategic insolvency**: a
situation whereby allies]{.underline}, including the United States, [are
**unable** to meet their **security obligations**]{.underline} and,
relatedly, maintain favorable standards of living for their populations.

Which brings us back to Madrid. [The last time that NATO agreed on a
strategic concept was in 2010]{.underline}. It is a document that
specified that, among other things, defense of allied territory remains
a critical mission for the alliance, but it is silent on naming
nation-state threats to NATO. For a variety of domestic and
international political reasons, building formal consensus on threats
among 30 allied states is extremely challenging. Indeed, [in the 2010
document Russia is **viewed as an aspirational partner** for
NATO]{.underline} when it comes to European security---[despite the
**warning sign** of Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia. In the
intervening years, Russia has conducted **destabilizing disinformation
campaigns**]{.underline} in NATO states [and]{.underline} has
[**attacked Ukraine twice**.]{.underline} And while NATO leaders have
condemned Russian aggression, the rhetoric falls short of formally
declaring Russia as a long-term strategic threat to the alliance.

[**Durable consensus requires clarity**. To **prepare NATO** to contend
with this threat over the long term requires a **frank admission** of
the **strategic realities that Russia poses**]{.underline} in the
alliance's new strategic concept, to be adopted in Madrid. As a
practical matter, this will commit NATO members to take budgeting, force
planning, acquisition, and possible troop repositioning seriously---and
put teeth into the declaration. This is needed for NATO planners to
determine, for example, whether spending 2 percent of GDP on defense is
sufficient to meet the challenges to the alliance.

But the real value of the document is what the collective members
reaffirm as to what NATO continues to stand for, what it calls out as
the threats to the member territory, and what it intends to do to
address, deter, and, if necessary, defend against these threats. [By
stating up front that **Russia is a**]{.underline} formal [**threat**,
member states]{.underline}---and the alliance as a whole---[will find it
**harder to backslide** from their **current cohesion**. It is
**difficult to overstate** how important it is for NATO to ensure its
**consensus is durable**]{.underline}; as the war grinds on and publics
begin feeling the economic effects of the conflict and sanctions on
Russia, [the temptation to dilute support]{.underline} to Ukraine [will
undoubtedly mount]{.underline}. Not to mention, [**calling it like it
is** will **send an important message** to Putin: **NATO will not be
deterred**.]{.underline}

[**Words matter.** It is time]{.underline} for NATO leaders
[to]{.underline} formally [**accept reality**: **Putin is a threat to
the alliance and its members**]{.underline}, and, therefore, they should
declare so in the news strategic concept. Indeed, **[not declaring
Russia a]{.underline}** formal **[threat]{.underline}** to NATO
territory [would **compromise NATO's credibility** and would **give
Putin a pass** for the atrocities and violations]{.underline} he has
committed [in Ukraine. Neither NATO nor the United States can **afford
to allow that** to happen.]{.underline}

Nuclear War Before and It Can Again,\" Toward Freedom, 10-31-2017,
https://towardfreedom.org/archives/activism/mass-mobilization-stopped-nuclear-war-before-and-it-can-again

[A common thread running through the entire post-1945 period is that
people **don't want to think about nuclear war**. When they're
**forced**]{.underline} [to think of it]{.underline}, when they can't
escape it, [they]{.underline} [**want to stop it**. But when it's not in
the **headlines**]{.underline} any more and governments are growing more
reasonable, [they'd]{.underline} **[just as well not]{.underline}**
think about it. If nuclear war did break out today, you can bet more
people would focus on it, but, of course, we don't want that war to have
to take place. [The peace movement's challenge is to maintain
its]{.underline} **[momentum and sense of danger]{.underline}** [---
even though the world might]{.underline} **[seem]{.underline}** [safer
and there are fewer nuclear weapons in the world. If the nations of the
world are **maintaining their arsenals**, the struggle]{.underline}
**[hasn't come to an end.]{.underline}** Do you think [the moment we're
experiencing today with]{.underline} **[Trump]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[North Korea]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[potentially]{.underline}** [a driving force for]{.underline}
**[another peak]{.underline}** [of movement **energy**?]{.underline}
What's different today? It's possible that there will be some revival of
the nuclear disarmament movement, [but we]{.underline} **[haven't
seen]{.underline}** [the surge of resistance **yet**.]{.underline} I'm a
co-chair of the national board of the group Peace Action, so I'm very
well aware of how peace groups are doing. While Peace Action isn't doing
badly, we're certainly not yet experiencing the surge of action in the
streets, such as when its predecessors, SANE and the Nuclear Freeze
Campaign, were taking off. One reason it's not taking place is that the
mass media rarely focus on the danger of nuclear war, and when they do
focus on it, it's the danger of some other country waging war on the
United States. One day it's Iran, another day it's North Korea --- but
they don't seem to get to the basic problem that nine countries have
15,000 nuclear weapons in their arsenals. It's a worldwide phenomenon,
as is the persistence of the idea of nuclear weapons as the ultimate
guarantor of national security. Right now there's also a sense that only
Koreans are vulnerable, that most Americans aren't at risk of being
bombarded by nuclear missiles. At the height of popular protest in the
1980s, millions of people were in the streets --- in part because U.S.
and Soviet arsenals could reach both sides quite easily. That got people
to wake up and realize that nuclear war wasn't such a hot idea after
all. How big a role did fear play in these spikes of organizing? How can
people dealing with fear of the Trump administration, or of North Korean
nuclear mobilization, help direct that energy into making nuclear
conflict less likely? I think [fear has probably been]{.underline}
**[the most important factor in mobilizing people.]{.underline}** When
you look at things psychologically, people should be afraid of nuclear
weapons and nuclear war. It seems irrational to go bury your head in the
sand and not worry about them. But it's also true, in two ways, that
fear is dangerous. One is that it can be demobilizing, that people get
so scared they're scared silent. They become so frightened they retreat
and they don't feel powerful any more. They might take drugs instead of
taking action. A second danger is that, if people are scared of nuclear
war, the hawks have an answer for them. They turn fear on its head: Yes,
they say, nuclear war could be a bad thing, that's why we need nuclear
weapons to deter the bad Russians, Iranians, North Koreans and so on.
This means fear may reinforce the desire for nuclear weapons rather than
for getting rid of them. [For these reasons, the use of nuclear fear has
to be]{.underline} very [**careful**. Peace activists have to make the
case that **as long as nuc**lear weapon**s exist there's no real
security from nuclear war**, and therefore we need to **get rid of
nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. That's the best case that can be made by
nuclear disarmament forces: The arms race is a race no one wins. What
are some of the forgotten "paths not taken" of weapons not built or
decisions not made as a result of anti-nuclear organizing? How might the
world be different if those things had been built? The neutron bomb was
being proposed during the Carter administration. This enhanced radiation
weapon was designed to destroy people rather than property, and was
scheduled by the Carter administration to be deployed in Western
European nations. But once peace groups learned of it and began to focus
on its terrible effects, this caused massive protests in Western
European nations and, eventually, an unwillingness to support the
neutron bomb deployment by their government officials. As a result, the
Carter administration finally concluded that, if Western governments
weren't willing to stand up for it, the U.S. government wasn't going to
be the villain of the piece. So Carter canceled plans for its
deployment. The MX missile was the jewel in the crown of the Reagan
administration during its first term of office. Peace groups said that
it was a first-strike weapon, and there was so much popular protest
against it that Reagan couldn't get funding through Congress.
Eventually, a plan that began as 200 missiles barely slipped through
with 50 missiles. That failure became the basis of the U.S. government's
push for strategic arms reduction treaties, for it meant the U.S.
government couldn't keep pace with development of intercontinental
ballistic missiles. And the next best thing was seeing to it that
neither country had those weapons. The best way to do that was to sign a
treaty: the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, which Gorbachev
welcomed and showed him, in many ways, to be a peace person, strongly
influenced by the movement. Gorbachev had his own peace-oriented ideas,
but he also received a large amount of information from the disarmament
movement in the United States and around the world. He would take time
out of his meetings with heads of state to meet with representatives of
groups like the Freeze campaign, SANE, and International Physicians for
the Prevention of Nuclear War. So, Gorbachev and Reagan's detente and
the overall drawback from the nuclear brink were heavily influenced by
the peace movement --- not just through public pressure but also through
direct engagement. Are there other potentially winnable campaigns of
this kind available to anti-nuclear weapons activists today that might
limit the likelihood of the Trump administration using nuclear weapons?
It seems to me there are two ways [to **develop mass
pressure**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} **[Trump]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Congress]{.underline}** [in connection with the
general problem of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The first has to do
with the trillion dollar nuclear "modernization" program --- the plan to
upgrade the entire nuclear weapons complex, build new bombers and
missiles and submarines and so on. That cost is so great that it
provides the opportunity to reach people who are already concerned about
the arms race or are satisfied with the weapons we already have and
don't want to bankrupt the country. So [you can **make
demands**]{.underline} for cutbacks in the "modernization" plan or
stopping it entirely and mobilize a sympathetic constituency. A second
way is to focus on Trump's mental instability: The fact that he's a
reckless, dangerous leader, who really shouldn't have the button to
launch nuclear war in his hand. That's what the currently proposed
Markey-Lieu bill seeks to address: Under its provisions, unless there's
a nuclear attack on the United States, the president cannot initiate
nuclear war without a Congressional declaration of war. Since Congress
hasn't declared war since 1941, that's a pretty big restriction.

**Ravenal 9** -- Professor Emeritus at the Georgetown University School
of Foreign Service

Earl Ravenal, "Designing Defense for a New World Order," Critical
Review: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Politics and Society

[The underlying notion of "the security bureaucracies . . . looking for
new enemies" is a **threadbare concept**]{.underline} that has somehow
taken hold across the political spectrum, from the radical left (viz.
Michael Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat bank"), to the liberal
center (viz. Robert H. Johnson \[1997\], who dismisses most alleged
"threats" as "improbable dangers"), to libertarians (viz. Ted Galen
Carpenter \[1992\], Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy of the
Cato Institute, who wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies). [What
is missing from]{.underline} most analysts' [claims of "threat
inflation," however, is **a convincing theory of why**]{.underline},
say, [the]{.underline} American [government]{.underline}
significantly(not merely in excusable rhetoric) [might magnify and even
invent threats]{.underline} (and, more seriously, act on such inflated
threat estimates). In a few places, Eland (2004, 185) suggests that such
behavior might stem from military or national security bureaucrats'
attempts to enhance their personal status and organizational budgets, or
even from the influence and dominance of "the military-industrial
complex"; viz.: "Maintaining the empire and retaliating for the blowback
from that empire keeps what President Eisenhower called the
military-industrial complex fat and happy." Or, in the same section: In
the nation's capital, vested interests, such as the law enforcement
bureaucracies . . . routinely take advantage of "crises"to satisfy
parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to get pet
projects\-\-- a.k.a. pork\-\--funded by the government. And national
security crises, because of people's fears, are especially ripe
opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182) Thus,
"[bureaucratic-politics" theory]{.underline}, which once made several
reputa- tions (such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin, and
Graham Allison) in defense-intellectual circles, and spawned an entire
sub-industry within the field of international relations,5 [is put into
the service of dismissing putative security threats as
imaginary]{.underline}. So, too, can a surprisingly cognate theory,
"public choice,"6 which can be considered the right-wing analog of the
"bureaucratic-politics" model, and is a preferred interpretation of
governmental decision- making among libertarian observers. As Eland
(2004, 203) summarizes: Public-choice theory argues \[that\] the
government itself can develop sepa- rate interests from its citizens.
The government reflects the interests of powerful pressure groups and
the interests of the bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although
this problem occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more
severe in foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies
that affect them less directly. There is, in this statement of
public-choice theory, a certain ambiguity, and a certain degree of
contradiction: Bureaucrats are supposedly, at the same time, subservient
to societal interest groups and autonomous from society in general. This
journal has pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely
consequence of the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity
(e.g., Somin 1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But
state autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute
their own interests for those of what could be called the "national
society" that they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that,
precisely because of the public-ignorance and elite-expertise factors,
and especially because the opportunities\-\--at least for bureaucrats (a
few notable post-government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)\-\--for
lucrative self-dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and
diplomatic areas of government than they are in some of the
contract-dispensing and more under-the-radar-screen agencies of
government, the "public-choice" imputation of self-dealing, rather than
working toward the national interest (which, however may not be
synonymous with the interests, perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is
less likely to hold. In short, state autonomy is likely to mean, in the
derivation of foreign policy, that "state elites" are using rational
judgment, in insulation from self-promoting interest groups\-\--about
what strategies, forces, and weapons are required for national defense.
Ironically, "public choice"\-\--not even a species of economics, but
rather a kind of political interpretation\-\--is not even about "public"
choice, since, like the bureaucratic-politics model, it repudiates the
very notion that bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they
are held, axiomatically, to exhibit "rent-seeking" behavior, wherein
they abuse their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at
least to build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches.
Such sub- rational models actually explain very little of what they
purport to observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding
the "behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances,
under some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that
they posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives. My treatment of "role" differs from that of the
bureaucratic-politics theorists, whose model of the derivation of
foreign policy depends heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and
specific identification of the role- playing of organizationally
situated individuals in a partly conflictual "pulling and hauling"
process that "results in" some policy outcome. Even here,
bureaucratic-politics theorists Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow (1999,
311) allow that "some players are not able to articulate \[sic\] the
governmental politics game because their conception of their job does
not legitimate such activity." This is a crucial admission, and one that
points\-\-- empirically\-\--to the need for a broader and generic
treatment of role. Roles (all theorists state) give rise to
"expectations" of performance. My point is that [virtually every
governmental role, and especially national-security roles]{.underline},
[and particularly the roles of the uniformed mili- tary,
embody]{.underline} expectations of devotion to the "national interest";
rational- ity in the derivation of policy at every functional level; and
[**objectivity** in the treatment of parameters, especially external
parameters such as "threats" and the power and capabilities of other
nations.]{.underline} [Sub-rational models]{.underline} (such as "public
choice") [fail]{.underline} [to take into account even a partial
dedication to the "national" interest]{.underline} ([or even the
possibility that the national interest may be honestly misconceived in
more paro- chial terms). In contrast, an official's role connects the
individual to the (state-level) process, and moderates the]{.underline}
(perhaps otherwise) [self-seeking impulses of the individual.
Role-derived behavior tends to be formalized and codified; relatively
transparent and at least **peer-reviewed**, so as to be consistent with
expectations; surviving the particular individual and trans- mitted to
successors and ancillaries; measured against a standard and thus
corrigible; defined in terms of the performed function and therefore
derived from the state function; and uncorrrupt, because personal
cheating and even egregious aggrandizement are conspicuously
discouraged]{.underline}. My own direct observation suggests that
[defense decision-makers attempt to "frame" the structure of the
problems that they try to solve on the basis of the **most accurate
intelligence**. They **make it their business to know** where the
threats come from. Thus, threats **are not "socially
constructed**"]{.underline} (even though, of course, some values are). A
major reason for the rationality, and the objectivity, of the process is
that much security planning is done, not in vaguely undefined circum-
stances that offer scope for idiosyncratic, subjective behavior, but
rather in structured and reviewed organizational frameworks.
Non-rationalities (which are bad for understanding and prediction) tend
to get filtered out. [**People are fired for presenting skewed
analysis** and for making bad predictions. This is because something
important is riding on the causal analysis and the contingent
prediction.]{.underline} For these reasons, "[public choice" does not
have the "feel" of reality to many critics who have participated in the
structure of defense decision-making. In that structure]{.underline},
obvious, and even not-so-obvious,["rent-seeking" would not only be
shameful; it would present a **severe risk of career
termination**.]{.underline} And, as mentioned, the defense bureaucracy
is hardly a productive place for truly talented rent-seekers to
operatecompared to opportunities for personal profit in the commercial
world. A bureaucrat's very self-placement in these reaches of government
testi- fies either to a sincere commitment to the national interest or
to a lack of sufficient imagination to exploit opportunities for
personal profit.

The realist approach

[In the realist view]{.underline}, the **[basic
principles]{.underline}** [of international politics **never
change**]{.underline}. [International affairs]{.underline} always
[remain essentially]{.underline} [a **struggle for power**]{.underline}
[among **self-interested states**]{.underline}. [Since realism is not a
unitary theory]{.underline}, **[different branches]{.underline}** [of
realism rely on **different** independent **variables**]{.underline}.
Classical realists like Hans **[Morgenthau]{.underline}** [see perpetual
conflict rooted in an innately]{.underline} **[selfish]{.underline}**
[human]{.underline} **[nature]{.underline}**, [which translates into
competitive state behavior]{.underline} (Morgenthau 1985). [Neorealists
such as Kenneth **Waltz**]{.underline} [focus on an inherently
**competitive international system**]{.underline} [without a central
organizing authority that **monopolizes power**]{.underline} [to manage
inter-state relations and **protect states** from one
another]{.underline} (Waltz 1979). [Within this anarchic international
system, **states** are]{.underline} [the **primary actors**]{.underline}
[and employ self-help strategies to survive and]{.underline}, depending
on the exact branch of neorealism, to **[maximize power]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**. [Because of an inevitably
**asymmetric distribution**]{.underline} [of power]{.underline}, [the
anarchic condition of international affairs may]{.underline}
**[compel]{.underline}** **[weaker states]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} either **[balance]{.underline}** against
[or]{.underline} **[bandwagon]{.underline}** with more powerful ones.
[Neoclassical realists marry neorealism's systemic assumptions with
domestic level factors that either facilitate or circumscribe foreign
policy]{.underline}, for instance domestic institutions,
government-society relations, and leadership perception (Ripsman et
al. 2016).

[Realism is]{.underline} generally **[pessimistic]{.underline}** [about
the prospects for **coop**eration]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[mutual support]{.underline}** [among states.]{.underline} [It
would]{.underline} immediately **[predict]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} national **[self-help and "us first"]{.underline}**
**[mentality]{.underline}** [that characterizes the global management of
**Covid-19** and its consequences]{.underline}. Travel and entry bans,
international scapegoating, great power competition and pharmaceutical
protectionism are ubiquitous.

[Even in the world's most integrated supranational organization, the
European Union (EU), member states **readily violate** otherwise
sacrosanct principles of cooperation]{.underline}, [and realists would
not be surprised by how quickly lofty European ideals and norms made way
for national self-help once the Covid-19 crisis hit the
continent]{.underline}. The outbreak was followed by immediate violation
of many existing EU regulations: competition law, fiscal discipline, and
freedom of movement[. As countries closed their borders, EU capitals
went into full nationalist gear]{.underline} (Guardian 2020a). Without
any EU-consultation process, a number of EU countries immediately closed
their borders and decreed export bans. When Italy, one of the worst
affected countries in the world, asked fellow EU members for emergency
relief with critical medical supplies, for several weeks it was met with
precisely what realism would expect: its neighbors violated the EU's
single-market spirit by decreeing export bans on pharmaceutical
equipment (Braw 2020; Reuters 2020).

[Dismayed by the lack of European solidarity, Rome was happy to accept
support from China, which, though itself badly affected, sent medical
equipment and experts immediately. Far from being altruistic, however,
Beijing aims to rewrite the Covid-19 narrative]{.underline}. It does not
want to be seen as the point-of-origin of the Covid-19 virus and views
the pandemic as an opportunity to come out ahead of the United States in
a zero-sum competition for global primacy. In Italy and elsewhere,
China's "mask diplomacy" is a noteworthy public relations coup (Kliem
and Chong 2020). Beijing wants to be recognized globally as a
responsible provider of public health goods in the absence of US
leadership, and thereby, progress towards its ultimate objective of
comprehensive power accumulation relative to Washington.

Indeed, the US has not only been absent in terms of leadership, but has
also actively engaged in nationalistic self-help at the expense of
others. President Donald Trump of the United States, Europe's closest
non-EU ally and partner, tried to lure CureVac, a German firm that was
developing a promising Covid-19 vaccine technology, to relocate its
Covid-19 research and development division to the US and to guarantee
exclusive American access to the firm's products (Die Welt 2020).
Similarly, Trump sought to block the sale of masks to Canada by a
US-based firm (MacCharles and Ballingall 2020), though a compromise was
arrived at later. The US (like other countries, e.g. Japan) has also
sought to restructure global supply chains in order to bypass dependence
on China (Pamuk and Shalal 2020), which---if it succeeds---will be a
radical and long-term change.

[Realists]{.underline} also [point out that **international
institutions**]{.underline} [do not **enable states** to **concentrate**
on greater **long-term gains** for everyone]{.underline}. Instead,
[international]{.underline} **[anarchy]{.underline}** [forces states to
**treat** international]{.underline} **[organizations]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[institutions]{.underline}** essentially **[like the
international system]{.underline}** itself: [as an arena for zero-sum
**competition**]{.underline}. [Indeed, as realism predicts, the World
Health Organization (WHO) has become **highly
politicized**.]{.underline} [For example, because of the PRC's refusal
to accept Taiwan as a diplomatically independent, sovereign nation
state, the WHO disregards Taiwan's experience with Covid-19 as well as
related research and development results. Allegedly bowing to pressure
from Beijing, the WHO does not recognize Taiwan and refuses to include
Taipei's very successful pandemic management strategies in its reports
on global research efforts]{.underline} (Financial Times 2020). This
also supports the neoclassical realists' argument about domestic
factors. It shows how domestic ideology shapes foreign policy decisions
in China and hinders international cooperation.

[If a severe **transboundary**]{.underline} [global]{.underline}
**[crisis]{.underline}** [cannot spur international cooperation, then
**what can**]{.underline}? [Realism reminds us that, because of the
**trust deficit**]{.underline} systemically **[inherent]{.underline}**
[in an international system characterized by **anarchy**]{.underline},
[states **hesitate**]{.underline} [to forgo their **first
instinct**]{.underline} [for self-help and zero-sum games]{.underline},
**[even amidst]{.underline}** a [common]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}** **[challenge]{.underline}**.

The liberal approach

Liberal theory highlights four imperatives for cooperation:
interdependence, transnationalization, the growth of international
institutions, and democracy (Doyle and Recchia 2011; Nye 1988).

When the fates of states are bound together, liberals claim, they must
cooperate or pay a very high price. The global economy, for instance, is
a complex network of trade, finance and manufacturing that places a
premium on cooperation. From this perspective, states must cooperate to
stem pandemics that flow seamlessly across the world and impose high
costs on all societies. They must share knowledge and material resources
to counter a scourge that harms them all. They certainly do so, for
example, in US-led efforts to ensure the reliable availability of
equipment to combat pandemics (Tribune 2020). But they do not cooperate
consistently. The [United States has sought to corner scarce medical
supplies (Bradley 2020), European states have failed to coordinate
policy (The Guardian 2020a), and China and the United States are
squabbling over responsibility (Shi and Wu 2020). In short, the pattern
is much as in another arena of contest between interdependent states:
the as yet unfinished "trade war."]{.underline}

Why? Interdependence does not automatically produce cooperation. It is
only when the breakdown of interdependence raises the prospect of
serious catastrophe that states cooperate. When nuclear-armed states are
on the verge of war, for instance, they engage in tacit cooperation by
practicing extreme caution and often seek explicit accommodation through
talks, as was the case in Cold War crises. Even so, they continue to
compete through arms racing, alliance building and occasional
brinkmanship. Comparatively low levels of interdependence amidst the
Covid-19 outbreak are unlikely to generate high levels of cooperation as
the threat to national survival is limited.

[The onset of pandemics has certainly produced unprecedented cooperation
among epistemic communities, such as virologists, in a
transnationalized]{.underline} world. Scientists from many countries
have worked together to manage the threat of a viral outbreak ever since
the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002. [The
appearance of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012
quickly led to the activation of a scientific network that has been
dubbed the "SARS club"]{.underline} (Butler 2012). More broadly, the
onset of MERS spurred global research, producing as many as 883
scientific papers in 92 countries between 2012 and 2015 (Zyoud 2016).
[Likewise, as the New York Times has noted, the Covid-19 outbreak has
galvanized unparalleled cooperative research in which scientists have
bypassed standard protocols and competitive secrecy to engage in shared
efforts (Apuzzo and Kirkpatrick 2020).]{.underline} But, not for the
first time, politics has trumped cooperation. The possibility of a
quantum leap in global scientific collaboration has been stymied by the
China-US spat, which has reduced the prospects of shared funding and
finance to fight the virus. [The US, for instance, stopped funding of a
critical coronavirus-related training program for Chinese and other
scientists even before the current outbreak. National priorities have
overridden collective action, which is entirely in accord with realist
expectations (Baumgaertner and Rainey 2020).]{.underline}

[The same malaise afflicts international institutions, which liberals
see as fostering high levels of cooperation. The Group of 7 major
economies (G7) failed to organize a summit meeting in March 2020, while
a subsequent meeting of their foreign ministers came up with no more
than an anodyne statement seeking to foster research cooperation and do
"whatever is necessary" to counter the economic fallout of the crisis
even as they disagreed on whether China was to blame for the onset of
the crisis]{.underline} (Schult 2020). The G20 did not do much better.
It did support debt relief for poor countries, but its announced \$5
trillion injection into the global economy was in fact no more than the
sum of moneys already committed by its individual members for themselves
(Chodor 2020). The institution at the center of the crisis, the WHO, has
been acknowledged as critical to the information flow relating to the
crisis. But the WHO has also been dogged by controversy for announcing
the onset of the pandemic late (on 11 March, by which time it had
already spread to 113 countries) and for apparently deferring to China
in doing so (Basrur 2020). Such failings have brought much criticism and
calls for its reform (South China Morning Post 2020).

Finally, [democracy is said to be a binding factor, at least among
developed economies. This is largely true with respect to the
relationship between democracy and war]{.underline}. But the evidence is
not persuasive in the present context. Developed democratic states in
Europe and North America have engaged in recurring tugs of war over the
sharing of counter-pandemic resources such as protective equipment and
ventilators and have done relatively little to take collective action
(Cohen and Musmar 2020). Overall, liberal theory does not have much to
offer to explain the weak nature of international cooperation in the
crisis.

Ideational approaches

[The constructivist approach is an essentially ideational theory (or set
of theories) that stresses the importance of belief structures,
identities and roles, holding that, fundamentally, the ways in which
actors behave in international politics are shaped by a consensus about
reality and appropriate responses to it]{.underline} (Onuf 1989). From
this standpoint, responses to the Covid-19 crisis are determined by
deeply embedded beliefs about the priorities that states should adhere
to in such a situation. The possibilities of cooperation, from a
constructivist perspective, are not circumscribed by the anarchic
condition in which states coexist (as realists would have it), but by
our beliefs about what is feasible and what is not in such a condition
(Pouliot 2011). The central dictum of the constructivist---"anarchy is
what states make of it" (Wendt 1992)---thus sees the lack of collective
action in the face of the pandemic not as an inevitable product of the
material reality of the world as it actually is, but as arising from a
realist thought structure. To wit, states fail to cooperate despite the
urgency of the Covid-19 crisis because they are weighed down by the
unquestioned notion that, even under the onslaught of a pandemic,
self-help must come first, and the exercise of power must shape action.
This worldview, for the constructivist, is an ideational construct that
needs to be overridden if cooperation is to be achieved.

It is to the credit of constructivism that it widens the space for
potential change by critiquing the realist perception of unalterable
reality. However, while the concept of ideational structure is helpful
in challenging established modes of thinking (and consequent habits of
action) over time, it [is not particularly helpful in offering insights
into the short-to-medium-term responses of states to crises like the
pandemic or to anticipating what, in fashioning states' responses, might
actually be do-able and what probably will not.]{.underline} On the
contrary, since constructivist thinking views both cooperation and
conflict in terms of thought structures, it explains very little as far
as responses to the current crisis go. In short, constructivism is not a
predictive theory and tends to be non-falsifiable and, more
pragmatically, lacking in much utility other than urging new thinking.
How to get from the present ideational structure to a more desirable one
when a crisis breaks out remains a knotty problem.

[Normative theory, which centers on moral judgment about what should
be---as distinct from the materialist view of international politics as
what is---is similarly problematic]{.underline} (Ramel 2011). Certainly,
it offers useful space for the identification of responsibility when a
crisis breaks out. The analyst may adopt two basic approaches that
Robert Gregory labels "backward-mapping" and "forward-mapping" (Gregory
1998). The former looks at the origin and history of the policy process
and how they might have created or contributed to the problem. In the
present case, one would ask: who was responsible for the outbreak of the
pandemic? A second question would be: was policymaker X warned about the
problem and did he/she take action to avert it or mitigate its potential
consequences? The latter approach considers the policy action taken at
the time of the crisis. Did the policymaker act appropriately once the
crisis had broken out? While both are normative questions, they also
have strong practical implications. The attribution of responsibility
relates to the consequences of the policymaker's actions and to whether
the individual held responsible was fittingly sanctioned or punished for
it, whether legally or politically. This has important implications. If
the person or persons responsible is/are not in some way punished,
he/she/they may tend to repeat this or similar errors and cause a
recurrence of societal harm. Here, China would certainly be one center
of analysis, as questions mount as to whether Beijing took the necessary
steps to share information once the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus
was first confirmed by Chinese medical doctors in late December (The
Guardian 2020b). As mentioned above, the WHO too is open to the charge
of prioritizing political expediency by not including Taiwan in its
assessments and recommendations.

The [problem, however, of explaining why states behave as they do
remains]{.underline}. The attribution of responsibility for a crisis is
normally only a post facto phenomenon and does little to inform the
analyst as to why international cooperation as a pattern of behavior
does or does not occur. Even more, the scope for anticipating future
behavior remains uncertain at best. Like constructivism, normative
theory is valuable in understanding critical aspects of international
cooperation or the lack of it, but it misses some of the most important
facets of international reality: it fails to explain why states tend to
let competition override cooperation when individual and collective
interests collide.

Conclusion: realism redux

Much post-Cold War academic thinking gave the appearance of a
"transition" in the way intellectuals view global politics: a "decline"
of realism and the rise of alternative approaches in apex-level
scholarly research (Maliniak et al 2011). However, this analysis shows
that [alternative paradigms in IRT have **much less grasp**]{.underline}
[over the current crisis than **realism**]{.underline}. The [continued
**dominance of the state**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} of
**[individual]{.underline}** [national]{.underline}
**[interests]{.underline}** [over **collective interests**]{.underline}
in the absence of effective international authority [is
**evident**]{.underline} [in global responses to the
pandemic]{.underline}. [Realism]{.underline} [tells us
that]{.underline}, [because of the systemic **trust
deficit**]{.underline} [in international affairs]{.underline},
especially in times of crises, [states will turn to
**self-help**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[zero-sum
calculations]{.underline}** [rather than]{.underline} to [cooperative
**collective action**]{.underline}. It is evident that [precisely such
behavior **dominates** the global **management**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} the **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 crisis. To be sure,
[cooperation]{.underline} does [occur]{.underline}, but
**[only]{.underline}** [when it **does not clash** with **national
interest**]{.underline}.

Going forward, a realist would expect further restrictions on
international exchange in order to minimize the threat and at least a
temporary but nonetheless significant scale-down of globalization, as it
were. The economic effects of the crisis are likely to be severe and
unpredictable, and likely to include recession, flight of capital,
widespread impoverishment, fall in agricultural output, and increased
deaths from other diseases such as malaria and HIV (Congressional
Research Service 2020; Economist 2020; Shiller 2020). These will be
subject to the same dynamics of cooperation and conflict as described
here, in particular in the context of Sino-US competition.

Rather worryingly, the Covid-19 crisis also points to what global action
on other critical issues such as climate change, severe economic
dislocation, or the apocalyptic consequences of nuclear war could look
like in the future. They will in all probability not induce intense
global cooperation to manage common challenges, but instead spur
nationalism, zero-sum competition and the application of power to secure
the objectives of individual nations.

On the positive side, realism also tells us that states try to imitate
the successful activities of their peers. Governments may look jealously
upon one another, but they will also adopt those measures used by others
that are seen to be working. In that sense, we can place hope in the
ability of Europeans and Americans to emulate successful measures taken
by states like New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan to contain the spread
of Covid-19.

Clearly, while all branches of IRT have something to offer, [realism is
**best equipped**]{.underline} [to explain and
**anticipate**]{.underline} [the ambit of international
**coop**eration]{.underline} [in a crisis of the **magnitude
of**]{.underline} the **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 pandemic. [Discounting
its value can only **subtract**]{.underline} [from the **potential of
IR**]{.underline} [as a discipline to **meet** its **social
function**]{.underline}.

Marcelo de Araujo, "Moral Enhancement and Political Realism," Journal of
Evolution and Technology, 6-xx-2014, https://jetpress.org/v24/araujo.htm

Some [moral enhancement theorists argue]{.underline} that [a society of
**morally enhanced individuals**]{.underline} [would be in a better
position to cope with important problems that humankind is likely to
face in]{.underline} the future such as, for instance, the threats posed
by **[climate change]{.underline}**, grand scale **[terrorist
attacks]{.underline}**, or the risk of **[catastrophic
wars.]{.underline}** [The assumption here is]{.underline} quite simple:
[our inability to cope successfully with these problems stems mainly
from a sort of deficit in human beings' **moral
motivation**]{.underline}. [If human beings were morally
better]{.underline} -- if we had enhanced moral dispositions -- [there
would be **fewer wars, less terrorism**, and more **willingness to save
our environment**.]{.underline} Although simple and attractive, **[this
assumption is]{.underline}**, as I intend to show,
**[false]{.underline}**. [At the root of threats to the survival of
humankind in the future is not a deficit in our moral
dispositions]{.underline}, [but the endurance of an **old political
arrangement** that prevents the pursuit of shared goals on a collective
basis.]{.underline} The political arrangement I have in mind here is the
international system of states. In my analysis of the political
implications of moral enhancement, I intend to concentrate my attention
only on the supposition that we could avoid major wars in the future by
making individuals morally better. I do not intend to discuss the
threats posed by climate change, or by terrorism, although some human
enhancement theorists also seek to cover these topics. I will explain,
in the course of my analysis, a conceptual distinction between "human
nature realism" and "structural realism," well-known in the field of
international relations theory. Thomas Douglas seems to have been among
the first to explore the idea of "moral enhancement" as a new form of
human enhancement. He certainly helped to kick off the current phase of
the debate. In a paper published in 2008, Douglas suggests that in the
"future people might use biomedical technology to morally enhance
themselves." Douglas characterizes moral enhancement in terms of the
acquisition of "morally better motives" (Douglas 2008, 229). Mark
Walker, in a paper published in 2009, suggests a similar idea. He
characterizes moral enhancement in terms of improved moral dispositions
or "genetic virtues": The Genetic Virtue Program (GVP) is a proposal for
influencing our moral nature through biology, that is, it is an
alternate yet complementary means by which ethics and ethicists might
contribute to the task of making our lives and world a better place. The
basic idea is simple enough: genes influence human behavior, so altering
the genes of individuals may alter the influence genes exert on
behavior. (Walker 2009, 27--28) Walker does not argue in favor of any
specific moral theory, such as, for instance, virtue ethics. Whether one
endorses a deontological or a utilitarian approach to ethics, he argues,
the concept of virtue is relevant to the extent that virtues motivate us
either to do the right thing or to maximize the good (Walker 2009, 35).
Moral enhancement theory, however, does not reduce the ethical debate to
the problem of moral dispositions. Morality also concerns, to a large
extent, questions about reasons for action. And moral enhancement, most
certainly, will not improve our moral beliefs; neither could it be used
to settle moral disagreements. This seems to have led some authors to
criticize the moral enhancement idea on the ground that it neglects the
cognitive side of our moral behavior. Robert Sparrow, for instance,
argues that, from a Kantian point of view, moral enhancement would have
to provide us with better moral beliefs rather than enhanced moral
motivation (Sparrow 2014, 25; see also Agar 2010, 74). Yet, it seems to
me that this objection misses the point of the moral enhancement idea.
[Many people, across different countries, already share moral beliefs
relating]{.underline}, for instance, [to the wrongness of harming or
killing other people arbitrarily,]{.underline} or to the moral
requirement to help people in need. They may share moral beliefs while
not sharing the same reasons for these beliefs, or perhaps even not
being able to articulate the beliefs in the conceptual framework of a
moral theory (Blackford 2010, 83). But although they share some moral
beliefs, in some circumstances they may lack the appropriate motivation
to act accordingly. Moral enhancement, thus, aims at improving moral
motivation, and leaves open the question as to how to improve our moral
judgments. In a recent paper, published in The Journal of Medical
Ethics, neuroscientist Molly Crockett reports the state of the art in
the still very embryonic field of moral enhancement. She points out, for
example, that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
citalopram seems to increase harm aversion. There is, moreover, some
evidence that this substance may be effective in the treatment of
specific types of aggressive behavior. Like Douglas, Crockett emphasizes
that moral enhancement should aim at individuals' moral motives
(Crockett 2014; see also Spence 2008; Terbeck et al. 2013). Another
substance that is frequently mentioned in the moral enhancement
literature is oxytocin. Some [studies suggest that willingness to
cooperate with other people]{.underline},and to trust unknown
prospective cooperators, [may be enhanced by an increase in the levels
of oxytoci]{.underline}n in the organism (Zak 2008, 2011; Zak and Kugler
2011; Persson and Savulescu 2012, 118--119). Oxytocin has also been
reported to be "associated with the subjective experience of empathy"
(Zak 2011, 55; Zak and Kugler 2011, 144). The question I would like to
examine now concerns the supposition that moral enhancement --
comprehended in these terms and assuming for the sake of argument that,
some day, it might become effective and safe -- may also help us in
coping with the threat of devastating wars in the future. [The
assumption that there is a relationship between,]{.underline} on the one
hand, [threats to the survival of humankind and]{.underline}, on the
other, [a sort of "deficit" in our moral dispositions is
c]{.underline}learly [made by]{.underline} some [moral enhancements
theorists]{.underline}. Douglas, for instance, argues that "according to
many plausible theories, some of the world's most important problems ---
such as developing world poverty, climate change and war --- can be
attributed to these moral deficits" (2008, 230). Walker, in a similar
vein, writes about the possibility of "using biotechnology to alter our
biological natures in an effort to reduce evil in the world" (2009, 29).
And Julian Savulescu and Ingmar Persson go as far as to defend the "the
need for moral enhancement" of humankind in a series of articles, and in
a book published in 2012. One of the reasons Savulescu and Persson
advance for the moral enhancement of humankind is that our moral
dispositions seem to have remained basically unchanged over the last
millennia (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 2). These dispositions have
proved thus far quite useful for the survival of human beings as a
species. They have enabled us to cooperate with each other in the
collective production of things such as food, shelter, tools, and
farming. They have also played a crucial role in the creation and
refinement of a variety of human institutions such as settlements,
villages, and laws. Although the possibility of free-riding has never
been fully eradicated, the benefits provided by cooperation have largely
exceeded the disadvantages of our having to deal with occasional
uncooperative or untrustworthy individuals (Persson and Savulescu 2012,
39). The problem, however, is that the same dispositions that have
enabled human beings in the past to engage in the collective production
of so many artifacts and institutions now seem powerless in the face of
the human capacity to destroy other human beings on a grand scale, or
perhaps even to annihilate the entire human species. There is, according
to Savulescu and Persson, a "mismatch" between our cognitive faculties
and our evolved moral attitudes: "\[...\] as we have repeatedly
stressed, owing to the progress of science, the range of our powers of
action has widely outgrown the range of our spontaneous moral attitudes,
and created a dangerous mismatch" (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 103; see
also Persson and Savulescu 2010, 660; Persson and Savulescu 2011b;
DeGrazie 2012, 2; Rakić 2014, 2). This worry about the mismatch between,
on the one hand, the modern technological capacity to destroy and, on
the other, our limited moral commitments is not new. The political
philosopher Hans Morgenthau, best known for his defense of political
realism, called attention to the same problem nearly fifty years ago. In
the wake of the first successful tests with thermonuclear bombs,
conducted by the USA and the former Soviet Union, Morgenthau referred to
the "contrast" between the technological progress of our age and our
feeble moral attitudes as one of the most disturbing dilemmas of our
time: The first dilemma consists in the contrast between the
technological unification of the world and the parochial moral
commitments and political institutions of the age. Moral commitments and
political institutions, dating from an age which modern technology has
left behind, have not kept pace with technological achievements and,
hence, are incapable of controlling their destructive potentialities.
(Morgenthau 1962, 174) Moral enhancement theorists and political
realists like Morgenthau, therefore, share the thesis that our natural
moral dispositions are not strong enough to prevent human beings from
endangering their own existence as a species. But they differ as to the
best way out of this quandary: moral enhancement theorists argue for the
re-engineering of our moral dispositions, whereas Morgenthau accepted
the immutability of human nature and argued, instead, for the
re-engineering of world politics. Both positions, as I intend to show,
are wrong in assuming that the "dilemma" results from the weakness of
our spontaneous moral dispositions in the face of the unprecedented
technological achievements of our time. On the other hand, [both
positions are correct in recognizing the **real possibility** of global
catastrophes resulting from the malevolent use of, for instance,
**biotechnology or nuclear capabilities.**]{.underline} The supposition
that individuals' unwillingness to cooperate with each other, even when
they would be better-off by choosing to cooperate, results from a sort
of deficit of dispositions such as altruism, empathy, and benevolence
has been at the core of some important political theories. This idea is
an important assumption in the works of early modern political realists
such as Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes. It was also later endorsed by
some well-known authors writing about the origins of war in the first
half of the twentieth century. It was then believed, as Sigmund Freud
suggested in a text from 1932, that the main cause of wars is a human
tendency to "hatred and destruction" (in German: ein Trieb zum Hassen
und Vernichtung). [Freud went as far as to suggest that human beings
have an ingrained "inclination" to "aggression" and
"destruction"]{.underline} (Aggressionstrieb, Aggressionsneigung, and
Destruktionstrieb), and that this inclination has a "good biological
basis" (biologisch wohl begründet) (Freud 1999, 20--24; see also Freud
1950; Forbes 1984; Pick 1993, 211--227; Medoff 2009). The [attempt to
employ Freud's conception of human nature in understanding international
relations has recently been resumed]{.underline}, for instance by Kurt
Jacobsen in a paper entitled "Why Freud Matters: Psychoanalysis and
International Relations Revisited," published in 2013. Morgenthau
himself was deeply influenced by Freud's speculations on the origins of
war.1 Early in the 1930s, Morgenthau wrote an essay called "On the
Origin of the Political from the Nature of Human Beings" (Über die
Herkunft des Politischen aus dem Wesen des Menschen), which contains
several references to Freud's theory about the human propensity to
aggression.2 Morgenthau's most influential book, Politics among Nations:
The Struggle for Power and Peace, first published in 1948 and then
successively revised and edited, is still considered a landmark work in
the tradition of political realism. According to Morgenthau, politics is
governed by laws that have their origin in human nature: "Political
realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by
objective laws that have their roots in human nature" (Morgenthau 2006,
4). Just like human enhancement theorists, Morgenthau also takes for
granted that human nature has not changed over recent millennia: "Human
nature, in which the laws of politics have their roots, has not changed
since the classical philosophies of China, India, and Greece endeavored
to discover these laws" (Morgenthau 2006, 4). And since, for Morgenthau,
human nature prompts human beings to act selfishly, rather than
cooperatively, political leaders will sometimes favor conflict over
cooperation, unless some superior power compels them to act otherwise.
Now, this is exactly what happens in the domain of international
relations. For in the international sphere there is not a supranational
institution with the real power to prevent states from pursuing means of
self-defense. The acquisition of means of self-defense, however, is
frequently perceived by other states as a threat to their own security.
This leads to the security dilemma and the possibility of war. As
Morgenthau put the problem in an article published in 1967: "The actions
of states are determined not by moral principles and legal commitments
but by considerations of interest and power" (1967, 3). Because
Morgenthau and early modern political philosophers such as Machiavelli
and Hobbes defended political realism on the grounds provided by a
specific conception human nature, their version of political realism has
been frequently called "human nature realism." The literature on human
nature realism has become quite extensive (Speer 1968; Booth 1991;
Freyberg-Inan 2003; Kaufman 2006; Molloy 2006, 82--85; Craig 2007;
Scheuerman 2007, 2010, 2012; Schuett 2007; Neascu 2009; Behr 2010,
210--225; Brown 2011; Jütersonke 2012). It is not my intention here to
present a fully-fledged account of the tradition of human nature
realism, but rather to emphasize the extent to which some moral
enhancement theorists, in their description of some of the gloomy
scenarios humankind is likely to face in the future, implicitly endorse
this kind of political realism. Indeed, like human nature realists,
moral enhancement theorists assume that human nature has not changed
over the last millennia, and that violence and lack of cooperation in
the international sphere result chiefly from human nature's limited
inclination to pursue morally desirable goals. One may, of course,
criticize the human enhancement project by rejecting the assumption that
conflict and violence in the international domain should be explained by
means of a theory about human nature. In a reply to Savulescu and
Persson, [Sparrow correctly argues that **"structural issues,"** rather
than **human nature**, constitute the main factor underlying political
conflicts]{.underline} (Sparrow 2014, 29). But he does not explain what
exactly these "structural issues" are, as I intend to do later. Sparrow
is right in rejecting the human nature theory underlying the human
enhancement project. But this underlying assumption, in my view, is not
trivially false or simply "ludicrous," as he suggests. Human nature
realism has been implicitly or explicitly endorsed by leading political
philosophers ever since Thucydides speculated on the origins of war in
antiquity (Freyberg-Inan 2003, 23--36). True, it might be objected that
"human nature realism," as it was defended by Morgenthau and earlier
political philosophers, relied upon a metaphysical or psychoanalytical
conception of human nature, a conception that, actually, did not have
the support of any serious scientific investigation (Smith 1983, 167).
Yet, over the last few years there has been much empirical research in
fields such as developmental psychology and evolutionary biology that
apparently gives some support to the realist claim. Some of these
studies suggest that an inclination to aggression and conflict has its
origins in our evolutionary history. This idea, then, has recently led
some authors to resume "human nature realism" on new foundations, devoid
of the metaphysical assumptions of the early realists, and entirely
grounded in empirical research. Indeed, some recent works in the field
of international relations theory already seek to call attention to
evolutionary biology as a possible new start for political realism. This
point is clearly made, for instance, by Bradley Thayer, who published in
2004 a book called Darwin and International Relations: On the
Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict. And in a paper
published in 2000, he affirms the following: Evolutionary theory
provides a stronger foundation for realism because it is based on
science, not on theology or metaphysics. I use the theory to explain two
human traits: egoism and domination. I submit that the egoistic and
dominating behavior of individuals, which is commonly described as
"realist," is a product of the evolutionary process. I focus on these
two traits because they are critical components of any realist argument
in explaining international politics. (Thayer 2000, 125; see also Thayer
2004) Thayer basically argues that a tendency to egoism and domination
stems from human evolutionary history. The predominance of conflict and
competition in the domain of international politics, he argues, is a
reflex of dispositions that can now be proved to be part of our evolved
human nature in a way that Morgenthau and other earlier political
philosophers could not have established in their own time. Now, what
some moral enhancement theorists propose is a direct intervention in our
"evolved limited moral psychology" as a means to make us "fit" to cope
with some possible devastating consequences from the predominance of
conflict and competition in the domain of international politics
(Persson and Savulescu 2010, 664). Moral enhancement theorists
comprehend the nature of war and conflicts, especially those conflicts
that humankind is likely to face in the future, as the result of human
beings' limited moral motivations. Compared to supporters of human
nature realism, however, moral enhancement theorists are less skeptical
about the prospect of our taming human beings' proclivity to do evil.
For our knowledge in fields such as neurology and pharmacology does
already enable us to enhance people's performance in a variety of
activities, and there seems to be no reason to assume it will not enable
us to enhance people morally in the future. But [the
question]{.underline}, of course, is [whether moral enhancement
will]{.underline} also [improve the prospect of our coping
successfully]{.underline} [with]{.underline} some major threats to the
**[survival of humankind]{.underline}**, as Savulescu and Persson
propose, or **[to reduce evil in the world]{.underline}**, as proposed
by Walker. V. The point to which I would next like to call attention is
that "human nature realism" -- which is implicitly presupposed by some
moral enhancement theorists -- has been much criticized over the last
decades within the tradition of political realism itself. "Structural
realism," unlike "human nature realism," does not seek to derive a
theory about conflicts and violence in the context of international
relations from a theory of the moral shortcomings of human nature.
Structural realism was originally proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the
State and War, published in 1959, and then later in another book called
Theory of International Politics, published in 1979. In both works,
Waltz seeks to avoid committing himself to any specific conception of
human nature (Waltz 2001, x--xi). Waltz's thesis is that the thrust of
the political realism doctrine can be retained without our having to
commit ourselves to any theory about the shortcomings of human nature.
What is relevant for our understanding of international politics is,
instead, our understanding of the "structure" of the international
system of states (Waltz 1986). John Mearsheimer, too, is an important
contemporary advocate of political realism. Although he seeks to
distance himself from some ideas defended by Waltz, he also rejects
human nature realism and, like Waltz, refers to himself as a supporter
of "structural realism" (Mearsheimer 2001, 20). One of the basic tenets
of political realism (whether "human nature realism" or "structural
realism") is, first, that the [states are the]{.underline} main, if not
the **[only, relevant actors]{.underline}** in the context of
international relations; [and]{.underline} second, that states
**[compete for power]{.underline}** in the international arena. **[Moral
considerations]{.underline}** in international affairs, according to
realists, [are **secondary**]{.underline} [when set against the state's
primary goal]{.underline}, **[namely its own security and
survival]{.underline}**. But while human nature realists such as
Morgenthau explain the struggle for power as a result of human beings'
natural inclinations, structural realists like Waltz and Mearsheimer
argue that conflicts in the international arena do not stem from human
nature, but from the very "structure" of the international system of
states (Mearsheimer 2001, 18). According to Waltz and Mearsheimer, [it
is this **structure** that compels individuals to act as they do in the
domain of international affairs.]{.underline} And one distinguishing
feature of the international system of states is [its "anarchical
structure,"]{.underline} i.e. the lack of a central government analogous
to the central governments that exist in the context of domestic
politics. [It means that each individual state is responsible for its
own integrity and survival]{.underline}. [In the absence of a superior
authority]{.underline}, over and above the power of each sovereign
state, [political leaders]{.underline} often [feel compelled to favor
**security over morality**]{.underline}, even if, all other things being
considered, they would naturally be more inclined to trust and to
cooperate with political leaders of other states. On the other hand,
when political leaders do trust and cooperate with other states, it is
not necessarily their benevolent nature that motivates them to be
cooperative and trustworthy, but, again, it is the structure of the
system of states that compels them. The concept of human nature, as we
can see, does not play a decisive role here. Because Waltz and
Mearsheimer depart from "human nature realism," their version of
political realism has also sometimes been called "neo-realism" (Booth
1991, 533). Thus, **[even if]{.underline}** [human beings turn out to
become **morally enhanced**]{.underline} in the future, [humankind may
still have to face the same **scary scenarios**]{.underline} described
by some moral enhancement theorists. [This is likely to happen if,
indeed]{.underline}, [human beings remain compelled to
cooperate]{.underline} within the present structure of the system of
states. Consider, for instance, the incident with a Norwegian weather
rocket in January 1995. Russian radars detected a missile that was
initially suspected of being on its way to reach Moscow in five minutes.
All levels of Russian military defense were immediately put on alert for
a possible imminent attack and massive retaliation. It is reported that
for the first time in history a Russian president had before him, ready
to be used, the "nuclear briefcase" from which the permission to launch
nuclear weapons is issued. And that happened when the Cold War was
already supposed to be over! In the event, it was realized that the
rocket was leaving Russian territory and Boris Yeltsin did not have to
enter the history books as the man who started the third world war by
mistake (Cirincione 2008, 382).3 But [under the crushing pressure of
having to decide in such a short time, and on the basis of unreliable
information, whether or not to retaliate, even a morally enhanced
Yeltsin might have given orders to launch a devastating nuclear
response]{.underline} -- and that **[in spite of strong moral
dispositions to the contrary.]{.underline}** Writing for The Guardian on
the basis of recently declassified documents, Rupert Myers reports
further incidents similar to the one of 1995. He suggests that as more
states strive to acquire nuclear capability, the danger of a major
nuclear accident is likely to increase (Myers 2014). [What has to be
changed]{.underline}, therefore, [is not human moral
dispositions]{.underline}, **[but the very structure of the political
international system of states]{.underline}** within which we currently
live. As far as major threats to the survival of humankind are
concerned, moral enhancement might play an important role in the future
only to the extent that it will help humankind to change the structure
of the system of states. While [moral enhancement]{.underline} may
possibly have desirable results in some areas of human cooperation that
do not badly threaten our security -- such as donating food, medicine,
and money to poorer countries -- it [will not motivate political leaders
to **dismantle their nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. [Neither will it
deter other political leaders from pursuing nuclear
capability]{.underline}, [at any rate not as long as the structure of
international politics compels them to see prospective cooperators **in
the present as possible enemies in the future.**]{.underline} The idea
of a "structure" should not be understood here in metaphysical terms, as
though it mysteriously existed in a transcendent world and had the
magical power of determining leaders' decisions in this world. The word
"structure" denotes merely a political arrangement in which there are no
powerful law-enforcing institutions. And [in the absence of the kind of
security that law-enforcing institutions have the force to
create]{.underline}, [political leaders will]{.underline} often **[fail
to cooperate,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} occasionally [engage
in]{.underline} conflicts and [wars]{.underline}, [in those areas that
are critical to their]{.underline} security and [survival]{.underline}.
Given the structure of international politics and the basic goal of
survival, [this is likely to continue to happen]{.underline}, **[even
if,]{.underline}** in the future, political [leaders become **less
egoistic and power-seeking**]{.underline} through moral enhancement. On
the other hand, since the structure of the international system of
states is itself another human institution, there is no reason to
suppose that it cannot ever be changed. If people become morally
enhanced in the future they may possibly feel more strongly motivated to
change the structure of the system of states, or perhaps even feel
inclined to abolish it altogether. In my view, however, [addressing
major threats to the survival of humankind in the future by means of
**bioengineering**]{.underline} [is unlikely to yield the **expected
results**, so long as moral enhancement is pursued **within the present
framework of the international system of states.**]{.underline}

### 2AC\-\--Securitization Good

#### Military applications of AI are inevitable, so [de-securitizing]{.underline} isn't an [option]{.underline}. The risks are [real]{.underline} and pretending they [aren't]{.underline} risks undermining effective governance strategies. National security framing is [key]{.underline} for [building trust]{.underline}.

[An Agenda For Ensuring **Security**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[Stability]{.underline}** in the Age of AI

[The starting point for dealing]{.underline} with the [international
**security implications**]{.underline} [of AI must be the
**acknowledgment**]{.underline} [that we are in it for the **long
haul**]{.underline}. There will be no quick fixes. [The]{.underline}
**[economic]{.underline}**, **[political]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[security drivers]{.underline}** [for mainstreaming
this]{.underline} **[suite of technologies]{.underline}**
[into]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}** functions
[are]{.underline} simply **[too powerful to be rolled
back]{.underline}**. [There will be plenty of **persuasive** national
**security applications**]{.underline}---[minimizing
casualties]{.underline} and [collateral damage]{.underline} through
[better discrimination of targets]{.underline}, [fighting]{.underline}
crime, defeating terrorist threats, saving on defense spending, and
protecting soldiers and their bases---to provide counterarguments
against concerns about runaway robots or accidental war caused by
machine error.

This acknowledgment must be accompanied by an intensification of
crossdomain literacy. AI cannot be the business of coders and cognitive
scientists alone; nor can its security implications be the province only
of diplomats, generals, and lawyers. Given the broad impact that AI
businesses can have on society, the business of AI has to be everyone's
business. Governance of AI can only be based on a correct understanding
of the power and limits of the technology, and such governance can only
be effective globally if it is part of a tiered approach that includes
actors at the intergovernmental, national, and industry levels.

Currently, [though]{.underline} military [investments in
**AI**]{.underline} [are]{.underline} being [acknowledged]{.underline},
[no state admits to the **existence**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
lethal autonomous **[weapon systems]{.underline}** in its inventory.
Thus, if [we want to **build** mutual **confidence** and]{.underline}
**[trust]{.underline}**, [we are left either to add
**discussions**]{.underline} on such systems [to]{.underline} existing
[dialogues on]{.underline} cyber**[security]{.underline}** and arms
control more broadly or to begin with new dialogues on approaches to
repurposable civilian capabilities. The latter might be a more
productive venue for engaging the private sector, which is wary of being
stigmatized by civil society as the maker or facilitator of "killer
robots." Tagging on discussions of AI to cybersecurity or traditional
arms control would also be unhelpful because of the risk of false
analogies.

Thus, [new]{.underline} innovatively structured
**[dialogues]{.underline}** in the track setting (involving both
government and nongovernmental parties) or the track setting
([involving]{.underline} artificial intelligence and **[international
security]{.underline}** only informal nongovernmental parties) [are
**required**]{.underline}. [The first objective should be to **enhance**
mutual]{.underline} **[understanding]{.underline}** [through in-depth
discussions on **national** approaches **to AI
development**]{.underline}, **[testing]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[validation]{.underline}**, [deployment, and use]{.underline}.
[Another objective should be to allow some **sharing** of **best
practices**]{.underline} or cautionary experiences. A third potential
objective would be to shift thinking from zerosum competitive approaches
to collaborative problem-solving using data and algorithmic insights
pooled by the participants themselves or put in escrow with a trusted
third party.

**[Agreement on norms]{.underline}** to govern the military use of AI
[could take time, but influencing the direction of such use by other
means]{.underline} **[brooks no delay]{.underline}**. One important
channel for shaping AI use globally is guiding principles short of
binding law. At a time [when there are **trust deficits** among
**nations** and]{.underline} **[multilateral negotiations]{.underline}**
[are at best seen as opportunities for "**lawfare**,"]{.underline} it
makes sense to rally around shared values and ethical principles. [In
the context of emerging technologies, such an approach also permits more
of an impact early on in the **innovation cycle**]{.underline}, when
national or international regulatory reach is absent or ambiguous.
Consistent with this logic, the EU High-Level Expert Group on Artificial
Intelligence has identified five principles---beneficence,
nonmaleficence, autonomy of humans, justice, and explicability---for the
trustworthy and ethical development of AI.

More specifically, [in]{.underline} the context of **[military
use]{.underline}**, [in the Group of Governmental Experts]{.underline}
of the Convention on Certain Conventional [Weapons on emerging
technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapon systems
(**LAWS**]{.underline}), [comprised of states and including all
**countries** thought]{.underline} to be **[pursuing national security
applications]{.underline}** of AI, identified ten guiding principles on
emerging technologies in the area of LAWS. These principles cover
aspects related to the applicability of international humanitarian law,
human responsibility, accountability, risk assessment and mitigation,
and the need to take a nonanthropomorphic view of such systems. The
guiding principles are accompanied by building blocks of common
understandings on definitions and the nature of human intervention
required throughout the various stages of technology development and
deployment to uphold compliance with international law, in particular
international humanitarian law.

Another channel for the soft governance of AI could be engineering
standards and codes. At a minimum, a common vocabulary for assessing
risks and aligning design with safety and reliability considerations is
needed. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' Global
Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems has started
building a shared, multidisciplinary, and evolving resource of terms.
There is further scope for constructing common standards that can
progressively align practices around the globe to responsible
principles.

Last Word

[There is a growing concern over the **repurposing of AI
technologies**]{.underline} for warfare. As with cyber weapons, [LAWS
could have indiscriminate effects]{.underline} and be turned around to
attack the attackers.They can create challenges for the application of
international humanitarian law principles, such as distinction,
proportionality, and precaution, all of which presuppose a degree of
human reflection and control. [Their international **security
implications** are still **unfolding** but could be as **significant as
the nuclear revolution**]{.underline} [in warfare]{.underline}, if not
more so. [Innovative and agile ways of **governing** the]{.underline}
use of **[AI]{.underline}** [are **needed urgently**]{.underline} [to
head off risks to **international peace**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[security]{.underline}**.

6\. The two faces of security -- and of peace [Security]{.underline},
especially [[state security]{.mark}, tends to be enacted in contexts of
the violently contested **political authority**]{.underline}.
[[Often]{.mark} it [is enacted through **violent
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rebranded as legitimate force. Small
wonder that some in the development community, including those who
drafted SDG 16, hesitate to use the word at all. [But [**although**
security is]{.mark} a **[deeply disputed]{.mark}** idea, [it is]{.mark}
also a **[highly]{.mark} [necessary]{.mark}** one]{.underline}.
[Security functions simultaneously as an analytical construct, as a
**frame for policy** and as a **moral narrative**]{.underline}. It is
distinct from the equally ambiguous if less contentious concept of
peace. Yet, at the same time, [it is]{.underline} often seen as
[**essential** [to the preservation of **peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Most of the things that international decision-makers, political and
security elites and development practitioners do in security's name are
supposed to protect the safety and welfare of people in a world of
multiple challenges and threats. However, [there is a tendency to slide
from **global**, to **national**, to **citizen** and to human security
and back again, without enough serious reflection on how they
**interconnect**]{.underline} and on where tensions and contradictions
lie hidden. Development agencies have too often plunged into security
policies and programmes, without a clear understanding of where they
might lead, who would benefit and how they might go wrong. The
ambiguities stem in part from a deep-seated tension between two distinct
visions of security (summarised in Table 3), which interconnect, yet are
in deep tension with eachother. [On the **one hand**]{.underline},
[[security]{.mark} can be seen as a process of political and social
ordering, aiming to reduce violence and keep the peace]{.underline}. As
such it is territorially organised and kept in place globally as well as
nationally through the authoritative discourses and practices of power,
including socially sanctioned violence. [[It connects to]{.mark}
conceptions of what Galtung termed '[negative peace']{.mark}: the
[ending]{.mark} of overt [violence, without]{.mark} necessarily
**[transforming]{.mark} the [conditions]{.mark}** giving rise to this
violence]{.underline} [or attending to the **quality** of the
**subsequent peace**]{.underline}. In this view security is a public
good delivered in principle by states, much like official or
donor-driven development.29 Yet in a world where states and indeed the
international order face sustained challenges, security is often kept in
place also through alternative nonstate or 'hybrid' networks of violence
and protection.30 Moreover, security is far from being an unalloyed
public good. In principle, it is equally shared and socially inclusive,
even if in practice it is anything but, especially at the insurgent
margins where insecurity is most acute. For [in practice [it
protects]{.mark} **socially [embedded power]{.mark}**, established
property relations and **social privilege** -- and reinforces global,
national and local **inequalities**]{.underline}. [[On the **other
hand**, security can be seen]{.underline}]{.mark} (in the vernacular)
[[as an **entitlement**]{.mark} **of citizens**]{.underline} and more
widely human beings [[to **social peace**]{.mark} and [**protection from
violence**,]{.mark} [abuses of **rights**]{.mark} and [**social
injustice**, along with]{.mark} other [**existential risks** such as
**famine** or **disease**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It connects to]{.mark}
the idea of '**[positive peace']{.mark}**, including **transformations**
in the social conditions giving rise to violence and [deepening]{.mark}
the **[relationships]{.mark} between states and** their
**citizens**]{.underline}. The vernacular understandings, day-to-day
experience, resilience and agency of the people and groups who are
'secured' and 'developed' are in this view the touchstone by which to
evaluate security and violence reduction[. Most [people **fall
back**]{.mark} up[on]{.mark} their **[social identities]{.mark}** -- as
women and men, members of families, clans, castes, [ethnic
groups]{.mark}, sects, religions and [nationalities]{.mark} -- [to
navigate]{.mark} their [social worlds]{.mark}, [to **respond to
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline} and violence and (sometimes) to
organise for violence. At the same time, [[these]{.mark} [**identities**
are **written into**]{.mark} the **[structures of]{.mark} power and
[inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [being [deployed to **establish
hierarchies of citizenship**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **patterns of
[exclusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ensuring that security is inclusive
and not simply the security of particular groups or the property of the
well-armed, powerful and wealthy, is fraught with difficulty and must be
negotiated at multiple levels. 'Security in the vernacular' is the term
used here rather than the interlinked but distinct concepts of 'human
security' and of 'citizen security' popularised by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank,31 which fit in the
conceptual toolboxes of development practitioners, humanitarian agencies
and intervention forces. Both human and citizen security have come under
criticism for 'securitising' development by framing poverty, exclusion
and vulnerability through security lenses, and thus paving the way for
military interventions in the affairs of fragile states.32 '[**[Security
in the vernacular]{.mark}'** paves the way for more precise and detailed
empirical scrutiny of how security and plays out in particular local and
national contexts. It highlights the experience and social agency of
those who are 'secured'. And it [underscores]{.mark} the [transformative
potential]{.mark} of security as an **entitlement**]{.underline}, [which
can be **actively claimed** by those who **challenge** the **deeply
rooted legacies** of **insecurity**, **exclusion** and
**injustice**]{.underline}. Both these faces of security have their
underside, most obviously the first. 'Seeing like a state' even with the
best of intentions can lead to the interests of citizens being
sacrificed to an unbending vision of national security or of top-down
development (as even in Nyerere's Tanzania).33 It is also open to abuse
-- for instance, to prop up authoritarian regimes; to advance the
interests of predatory elites; to impose exclusionary economic and
social policies; to justify state secrecy and surveillance of citizens;
or to justify the hegemonies and military adventurism of major world
powers. And it tends to be closely if complexly related to 'seeing like
a corporation', most obviously in enclave economies, where privatised
security arrangements in protected enclaves may indeed destabilise or
weaken the state.34 The [**deformations** of **security in the
vernacular** tend to be more hidden]{.underline}, but no less damaging
-- for instance, [the submission of minorities and refugees to campaigns
of exclusion and violence by populist majorities]{.underline}; [forms of
**popular justice** that **violate the rights**]{.underline}, dignity
and safety of supposed perpetrators; or grass roots endorsement of
'traditional' or customary institutions, which perpetuate gender and
other inequities. Moreover, local-level insecurities can persist or even
worsen, when a state, like India or Brazil, is considered to be stable,
or a region or locality is considered to be secure. Neither face of
security can be considered without the other. The relationship between
them is utterly crucial. The capacity of states to protect their
citizens is at the basis of the social contract.35 That is, [the rights
and security of citizens]{.underline} and people [are the bedrock of
state and international security -- or at least they **should
be**]{.underline}. But [these entitlements cannot be protected without
some kind of **social order**]{.underline}, however achieved. [And how
and by whom social order is assured are both **affairs of governance**
and **vital concerns** for **everyone** who lives under the **leaky
umbrella** of **political authority**]{.underline}. **[[Political
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[durable
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the]{.underline} [**[rule of
law]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[effective and
[accountable security apparatuses]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[are]{.underline}**]{.mark} not just **[[desirable]{.mark} attributes
of states]{.underline}** but are also in many respects conditions of the
security of people. However, [[they]{.mark} **[come at a
price]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not just in taxes, but also [[because of
the need for **constant vigilance**]{.mark} to ensure that those charged
with delivering security do not ignore or still worse violate the
entitlements of those they are supposed to protect]{.underline}.

Affect the Risk of Nuclear War?" RAND Corporation, 2018,

Overall workshop participants agreed that [**AI has significant
potential to upset the foundations of nuclear stability and undermine
deterrence by the year 2040,** especially in the increasingly multipolar
strategic environment.]{.underline} [Dismissing the Hollywood nightmare
of malevolent AIs trying to destroy humanity with nuclear weapons,
experts were instead concerned with more-mundane issues arising from
improving capabilities.]{.underline} AI applications discussed included
the ability to track and target adversary launchers for counterforce
targeting and the incorporation of AI into decision support systems
informing choices about the use of nuclear weapons.

[Some experts fear that an increased reliance on AI could lead to new
types of **catastrophic mistakes.** There may be pressure to use it
**before it is technologically mature**; it may be **susceptible** to
**adversarial subversion**; or adversaries may believe that the AI is
more capable than it is, leading them to make **catastrophic
mistakes**.]{.underline}

On the other hand, [if the nuclear powers manage to **establish a form
of strategic stability** compatible with the emerging capabilities that
AI might provide, the machines could **reduce distrust** and **alleviate
international tensions**, thereby **decreasing the risk of nuclear
war.**]{.underline}

[At present, we cannot predict which---if any---of these scenarios will
come to pass,]{.underline} but [**we need to begin considering the
potential impact of AI on nuclear security before these challenges
become acute**.]{.underline} [Maintaining strategic stability in the
coming decades may prove extremely difficult]{.underline}, and all
nuclear powers will have to participate in the cultivation of
institutions to help limit nuclear risk. This goal will demand a
fortuitous combination of technological, military, and diplomatic
measures that will require rival states to cooperate. We hope that this
Perspective will begin that discussion and open a path toward pragmatism
and realism on these controversial and often polarizing topics.

### 2AC\-\--Securitization Inev

#### AI representations by foreign actors mean securitization is inevitable

**Zeng 21** - Professor of China and International Studies in the
Department of Politics, Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster University

Jinghan Zeng, "Securitization of Artificial Intelligence in China", The
Chinese Journal of International Politics, Volume 14, Issue 3, Pages
417--445, Autumn 2021,
<https://doi-org.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/10.1093/cjip/poab005>

Geopolitically speaking, [**China's national approach towards AI and
moves to make it a security matter are fuelled by ever more competitive
United States--China relations. Each side's perception of the other's AI
advancement as a threat accelerates the securitization process.** In the
domestic arena, where the primary concern is the regime security of the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP),]{.underline} **[the practical use of AI
and its relevant discourses are geared to securing authoritarian
rule]{.underline}**. In this regard[, China's bold AI experiments
practice a unique digital technocracy, making its AI approach quite
distinct from that in Western societies.]{.underline}

Currently, [this securitization is an ongoing process]{.underline}.
Although [**the extent of its impact on targeted audiences**, namely,
local governments, market actors, intellectuals, and the general
public**, remains unclear, all nevertheless enthusiastically echo the
central government's AI campaign**]{.underline}. In this regard, [such
securitization appears to convince domestic actors]{.underline}.
However**[, it also generates unintended consequences]{.underline}**.
They are: (i) **[creation of a nationalistic environment that makes
China less attractive to global AI labor and capital]{.underline}**;
(ii) **[impaired industrial efficiency by virtue of focusing on
self-reliance]{.underline}**; (iii) **[obstruction of China's global AI
governance leadership]{.underline}**; (iv) **[reinforced technological
rivalry due to disregard for potential global AI
cooperation]{.underline}**; and (v) **[constraints on the global access
of Chinese AI companies]{.underline}**. [All could undermine China's key
objectives of fostering a booming AI economy and becoming a global AI
leader.]{.underline}

Indeed, [**securitization of AI has progressively become a global
movement**. In the United States and Europe, for example, **the AI
advancements of geopolitical competitors, especially Russia and China,
are often perceived as a potential threat to national and international
security**]{.underline}. [The relevant speech act frames AI not as a
normal technology, but as a national security matter that **justifies
the enablement of extraordinary actions from the state and
society**.]{.underline} In effect, [it signifies the urgent need to
deploy more resources and support, for example, in the US case, not only
to the American AI-enabled military sector, but also the AI commercial
industry.]{.underline}

This article focuses on how AI is securitized within China. [Needless to
say, **the securitization process works differently in the Chinese
context, given its unique state-society relations**]{.underline}.
[Despite a non-liberal democratic setting, however**, there is still a
need to convince the domestic audience and thus win more support for
China's national AI plan**]{.underline}. Table 1 categorizes the
arguments into the securitization framework. It argues that [the Chinese
central government, as the securitizing actor, is performing a
securitizing move by labeling China's AI advancement as a matter of
security.]{.underline} In the relevant discourses, the national
interests and survival of the Chinese nation constitute the referent
object that needs to be protected[. As part of the central government's
AI campaign to mobilize domestic actors, this performative act aims to
convince the domestic audience including local, subnational, academic
actors, market actors,]{.underline} and the mass, as the rest of the
article will explore.

[The relevant securitizing move belongs to the type of securitization
referring to a directive elementary speech whose aim is to raise an item
on the agenda]{.underline}.36 **[It consists of "three sequential,
elementary speech acts," including claim, warn, and
request.]{.underline}**37 In this case, [the State Council of China aims
to raise its audience's awareness of AI's importance, and requests the
relevant actions]{.underline}. As the quote at the beginning of the
article claims and warns, **[other countries (i.e. China's competitors)
are elevating AI as a significant national strategy for the sake of
national security.]{.underline}**

The document also claims that, **[as China lacks significant original AI
innovations, China's overall AI development lags behind that of other
great powers]{.underline}**.38 As such, **[it requests the nation's
prioritization of AI advancement to protect national
security]{.underline}**. [On the heels of this request comes the setting
of the broad goal to make China a leading AI power, along with a
three-step plan and a targeted timeline to]{.underline}: (i) **[catch up
with the AI technological progress of world-leading countries such as
the United States by 2020]{.underline}**; (ii) **[make major
breakthroughs in certain AI technologies by 2025]{.underline}**; and
(iii) **[become a global leading AI power by 2030]{.underline}**.39 In
short, **[the Chinese central government is labeling AI as a national
security matter and highlighting the threat of falling behind in efforts
to convince domestic actors to support its action plan.]{.underline}**

[The serious damage American sanctions have inflicted on Chinese tech
companies **has heightened China's awareness of both its technological
weakness and feelings of insecurity in regard to global
reliance**]{.underline}. Understandably, therefore, **[China wants to
master leading AI technology independently]{.underline}**. As Xi Jinping
elaborates:

[accelerating the development of a new generation of AI is an important
strategic handhold for China to gain the initiative in global science
and technology competition...**We need to ensure that the core AI
technologies are firmly in our own hands.**]{.underline}62

[China's AI aspirations extend to global leadership]{.underline}. Since
China's rise, the US-led global order has left China dissatisfied due to
the limits it places on China's say in global norms and rules.63 Rather
than a norm-taker, China now aspires to be a norm-shaper, or even a
norm-maker. Many Chinese scholars argue that current established norms
are geared primarily to serving interests other than those of China.64
[To maximize Chinese interests, therefore, future norms should be
defined by/for China, and on Chinese terms.]{.underline}

In addition to history and geopolitics**[, China's securitizing move
also has a domestic context]{.underline}**. Certain [scholars see AI as
exerting two types of impact on China's national security---traditional
and non-traditional]{.underline}.80 [**The former refers to the military
threat**, namely the aforementioned use of AI in warfare; **the latter
includes such non-military sources as political security, economic
security, environmental security, cyber security, and energy
security**]{.underline}.81 However**[, most important is the so-called
political security (政治安全) or institutional security (制度安全),
i.e., regime security.]{.underline}**

As far as regime security is concerned, [the bold and controversial AI
practices China applies to state governance is an inevitable
topic]{.underline}. As part of the CCP's adaptation strategy in the
digital age, **[China has invested heavily in AI technologies in order
to advance towards digital governance]{.underline}**. Such **[AI
investment expects returns in the form of improved public services (by
enhancing efficiency), and maintenance of authoritarian
rule.]{.underline}**82 [AI's empowerment of digital surveillance is
widely discussed among international analysts, having been used to
upgrade China's sophisticated state surveillance program and potentially
reshape state-society relations]{.underline}.83 Although
similar---though less intensive and extensive---[AI surveillance
programs have been implemented worldwide, due to privacy concerns they
have met with considerable social resistance in Western societies in
efforts to balance states' use of AI]{.underline}.84 **[In China,
however, there is scant legal constraint on the relevant AI
practices]{.underline}**. For example, [China has pioneered AI facial
recognition technology, which has been restricted, or even banned in
many Western societie]{.underline}s. Meanwhile, to reduce social
resistance[, **the Chinese government has proactively guided public
opinion on AI by framing it as positive and modern social progress that
is of enormous benefit in securing public safety,**]{.underline} as will
be discussed later.

**[Certain Chinese scholars also link AI with economic
security.]{.underline}** Li Zheng from the China Institutes of
Contemporary International Relations, for example, holds that
[sustaining the current socialist market economy with Chinese
characteristics is the core of China's economic security]{.underline}.85
In essence**[, this economic security extends to regime security, i.e.,
securing the CCP's rule]{.underline}**. In spite of its quasi-capitalist
market reforms, [the CCP's economic policies have always been
constrained by its ideological commitment to being a communist
entity]{.underline}.86 Thus, in the interests of its political
legitimacy, [the CCP must uphold certain socialist
responsibilities]{.underline}. Li argues that **[AI will be able not
only to improve socioeconomic governance, including market supervision,
and fight economic crime, but also strengthen the CCP's capability to
manage the macro and microeconomy]{.underline}**.87

#### Chinese securitization makes AI competition inevitable

**[This article shows that the Chinese central government is performing
a securitizing move by labeling AI as a security matter in order to
convince local states, market actors, intellectuals, and the general
public]{.underline}**. But if AI is indeed being securitized, so what[?
Although it is difficult to quantify the exact impact of this
securitizing move, it undoubtedly helps the Chinese central government's
mobilization of domestic actors towards advancing its AI
agenda]{.underline}. Nevertheless, this move also generates unintended
consequences for the securitizing actor's goal in the long run.
According to the State Council's AI plans, its three-step AI plan
carries the specific goals of fostering a booming AI economy, and a
grand goal of becoming a global AI leader.125 Securitization may
undermine these key objectives for several reasons.

First, a highly securitized AI sector will affect the flow of foreign AI
labor and capital to China's AI industry. To make it attractive to
global talent and capital, a booming AI industry requires an
outward-looking, open-minded, and international socio-politico-economic
environment. However, the securitization trend is pushing in the
opposite direction by producing a rising nationalistic, inward-looking,
security AI discourse. This is counterproductive to China's AI
ambitions, because it puts China at a disadvantage in the global market.
More specifically, there is a global shortage of AI talent and, as
previously mentioned, China is short of 5 million or more qualified AI
industry workers. This has led to fierce global competition in the AI
industry for qualified workers, to the extent where Chinese tech
companies offer extremely---or unreasonably---high salaries.126 Such
financial attraction, however, could be offset by an unfavorably
nationalistic domestic environment.

Second, the securitization trend could hinder economic efficiency. As
previously discussed, it contributes to the rise of a self-reliance
discourse on technology whose creation is often at the cost of economic
efficiency. Precisely because China is lagging behind in AI development,
it needs to make use of the global AI supply chain to catch up. However,
the self-reliance discourse considers the risk of relying on foreign
technology too high, and thus focuses on "Made in China." Such
self-reliance is difficult (if not impossible) to realize in the short
run, and hinders China's ability to benefit from the global AI market
and thus maximize industrial efficiency. Similarly, the securitization
of AI in the United States also undermines the appeal that America holds
for Chinese national AI talent, capital, and technology. Growing tension
between China and the United States has, moreover, undermined Chinese
companies' willingness to invest in the United States. In the long run,
therefore, securitization is detrimental to the competitiveness of the
American AI industry.

Third, in connection with the above paragraph, the domestic
inward-looking nationalistic trend that securitization has created
hinders China's realization of global leadership. To lead AI in the
global arena, China must provide public goods and win support from
others through successful partnerships. It must play a key role in
promoting global governance and, as a global leader, act according to
common interests rather than solely national interests. However, a
security-focused, inward-looking, nationalistic AI discourse is helpful
to neither global governance nor common interests. For example, it can
foster the rise of inward-looking national AI policies that prioritize
national interests over those of the globalized world. This is in direct
contrast to global governance goals, i.e., to build a shared future
through global solidarity. Indeed, many of the problems that AI has
created, such as those relating to ethics, represent collective
challenges to humankind that require a globally concerted response.
Inward-looking national AI policies may contribute to a fragmented
global governance structure, and thus obstruct concerted global actions
to address AI problems.

Fourth**[, the securitization trend has reinforced technological rivalry
at the expense of the potential for global AI cooperation, and will
likely exacerbate the United States--China confrontation]{.underline}**.
[This is not to deny the existence of United States--China cooperation
in the field of AI]{.underline}. [However, **by speaking of AI in the
language of security and a global race, the relevant security AI
discourse emphasizes competition over cooperation and destruction over
creation.**]{.underline} [This may produce a real security threat, and
perhaps an actual global AI race, thus undermining the space for
cooperation from which both the United States and China can
benefit.]{.underline} In other words**[, the rivalry discourse adopts a
zero-sum geopolitical angle for understanding AI innovation that is
inevitably to the latter's detriment in both
countries.]{.underline}**127

More importantly, **[securitization may push AI further into the hard
security area by virtue of its military applications]{.underline}**.
[The securitizing actor tends to exaggerate the security threat to
achieve a successful securitization, so enhancing the strategic risks of
AI military practices and increasing the likelihood of war, and of
escalating ongoing conflicts]{.underline}. [**In this regard, a highly
securitized AI politics may set China and the United States on a
dangerous path towards a catastrophic confrontation that imperils
everyone's interests and security**. In the worst case scenario, as in
all arms races, **blithe assertions about the inevitability of
AI-enabled war are a self-fulfilling and self-defeating
prophecy.**]{.underline} In this regard, the aforementioned Fu Ying's
call to regulate AI's military application merits more attention.

Lastly, by strengthening state involvement in China's AI industry,
**[securitization may undermine the interests of Chinese AI
companies]{.underline}**. [The boundary between the state and the market
is always far less defined in China than in other countries, due to
China's political environment]{.underline}. [**Making AI a national
security matter justifies the necessity for heavier state involvement,
if not control**.]{.underline} Although a blessing in the Chinese
domestic market, **[close ties with the state are a burden on the global
stage]{.underline}**. [Take the aforementioned civil-military
integration]{.underline} as an example. [Although helpful in gaining
China's AI companies and research institutes more state funding, it
undermines their global access]{.underline}. **[Close relations with the
Chinese government have caused certain Chinese AI companies, including
members of the "national AI team of China," to be subjected to
punishment, in the form of the aforementioned American
sanctions]{.underline}**. In this regard, **[securitization could hinder
the access of China's AI companies to the global market, and hence their
future development]{.underline}**. [It also remains to be seen whether
heavier state involvement in the AI industry hinders market
efficiency.]{.underline}

How AI Could Enhance Chinese Capability

[The most likely sources of a potential U.S.-Chinese
conflict]{.underline}, [such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or a
contest over some South China Sea feature]{.underline}, [would likely
feature the full spectrum of]{.underline} civil and military information
[operations aimed at deterring U.S. intervention and degrading U.S.
allies']{.underline} will to fight. AI could play a dominant role in
each of these missions. The Network Systems Department of [the People's
Liberation Army]{.underline}, for example, [may try using generative
language models to synthesize and amplify content on Facebook and
Instagram]{.underline}, [as it has done]{.underline} using botnets and
other non-AI tools [around Taiwanese elections]{.underline}. [The
Chinese military is]{.underline} also [likely to wage a similar campaign
to discredit U.S. military activities or sow division with partners,
including Australia and Japan]{.underline}.

Soon after the start of a conflict, [the People's Liberation Army would
likely attack U.S. sensor and communication networks]{.underline}, and
several different kinds of machine-learning applications could aid this
task. A cadre of [scientists at the People's Liberation Army National
University of Defense Technology]{.underline}, for example, [specializes
in "fuzzing,"]{.underline} [using machine learning to identify
vulnerabilities in an adversary's computer networks.]{.underline}
Experts also point to AI's role in attacking or defending critical
infrastructure in Taiwan, Japan, Australia, or the United States.

[Chinese planners]{.underline} also [aim to use AI for electronic
countermeasures and operations across the electromagnetic
spectrum]{.underline}. For example, analysts from anquan neican (a
Chinese journal for cybersecurity research) are optimistic about
[cognitive electronic warfare]{.underline} --- [using AI to analyze
incoming radar signals]{.underline}, and then [automatically adapting
one's own output to optimize jamming]{.underline}. But several other
applications of AI also play a role in electronic spectrum operations.
[In 2020]{.underline}, for example, [the People's Liberation Army
awarded equipment contracts for swarms of drones equipped with modular
radar-jamming systems]{.underline}, [which could be flown near U.S.
carrier strike groups]{.underline}, military [installations in Japan and
South Korea]{.underline}, or shared [facilities in the
Philippines]{.underline}. [Many systems under development]{.underline}
by Chinese universities and military research institutions [are
explicitly designed to counter U.S. drone systems and swarm
concepts]{.underline}. [Chinese companies have]{.underline} already
exported [drones to Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, and
Egypt]{.underline}, among others. However, while some People's
Liberation Army experts contend that these drones have been "battle
tested," others are less sanguine about their capabilities in a real
conflict.

Moreover, [the People's Liberation Army may]{.underline} attempt to [use
AI to enhance the lethality and reach of]{.underline} its [surface ships
and anti-access and area denial systems]{.underline}, [which could hold
U.S. forces at risk during a crisis]{.underline}. China's current
approach to territorial defense relies on hundreds of short- to
long-range ballistic missiles that would target U.S. aircraft carriers
and strike aircraft based in mainland Japan, Okinawa, South Korea, and
as far away as Guam. [As early as 2016]{.underline}, [Wang
Changqing]{.underline}, [director of the General Design Department of
the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation]{.underline},
[claimed that the company's next generation of cruise missiles would use
AI to adapt to specific combat conditions]{.underline}, being [capable
of adjusting flight profiles and even warhead yield]{.underline}.
Chinese defense industry engineers appear inspired by the U.S.
Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, which uses AI to improve accuracy and
achieve more flexible targeting.

Finally, t[he People's Liberation Army is building a wide array of
autonomous vehicles and extensive undersea sensor networks that make use
of AI and big-data analytics.]{.underline} [These systems may be useful
in recording and transmitting the locations of U.S. undersea
vehicles]{.underline}, and would be crucial to [overcoming the Chinese
military's disadvantages in undersea warfare]{.underline}. [Large
unmanned submarines]{.underline}, such as the HSU-001 and Haishen-6000,
[could be equipped with sea mines to deny the U.S. Navy access to
undersea space between the first and second island chains]{.underline},
[or to restrict access to the Taiwan or Luzon Straits.]{.underline}

Of course, [AI has the potential to revolutionize Chinese
operations]{.underline} in countless other ways, including [through
predictive maintenance, logistics, and back-office tasks]{.underline}
not discussed in depth in this article. In any case, it is clear that
[the People's Liberation Army is banking on the technology to create
asymmetric advantages vis-a-vis the United States.]{.underline}

The Threat of Biological Weapons: [A **Justification** of Biological
Weapons **Securitization**]{.underline}

1\. Introduction

In 2001, when [attacks were carried out]{.underline} in the United
States [involving]{.underline} Bacillus [anthracis]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} bacterial [agent]{.underline} that causes anthrax,
[the threat of biological weapons came into **sharper
focus**]{.underline} for the American government. [These attacks were
not the beginning of the biological weapons threat]{.underline}, [but
rather a point along a **continuum**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
increasing **[risk]{.underline}**. Article 1 of the 1972 Biological
Weapons Convention defines biological weapons to include the "microbial
or other biological agents, or toxins, whatever their origin or method
of production, of types and in quantities that have no justification for
prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes" as well as the
"weapons, equipment, or means of delivery designed to use such agents or
toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict"1. The use of
biological weapons dates back centuries, but the fear of biological
weapons of mass destruction, here defined as weapons that pose an
existential threat to the target, is relatively recent2. Much of it is
attributable to the rapid advances made in the biological sciences over
the past decade, particularly with respect to the field of genomics,
where there is a growing ability to manipulate genes3. This knowledge
has a variety of applications in the field of bioweapons. Additionally,
while states use of biological weapons was a concern through much of the
20th century, the possibility that rogue states or non-state groups
would use biological weapons was largely ignored until the start of the
21st century1.

Therefore, [the **threat** of biological **weapons** has been framed as
a **security issue**]{.underline} 4. This essay examines whether, and to
what degree, the threat of a biological weapons attack has been
overstated with respect to the government's response by drawing on
securitization theory, which critically evaluates the process through
which an issue comes to be viewed through a security framework. In
addition, the essay will also use the precautionary principle, described
by the 1998 Wingspread Statement as the notion that "when an activity
raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary
measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are
not fully established scientifically"5. Though more often applied to
considerations of environmental risk, in the case of biological weapons,
the principle could be used to justify caution even in the absence of
consensus surrounding the probability of an attack, simply due to the
severity of the consequences if an attack was to occur.

It will be argued that [the]{.underline} **[biological
weapons]{.underline}** [threat has **not** been **overestimated** and
that the biodefense measures **expressed**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
**[current]{.underline}** **[policy]{.underline}** [and funding
decisions **are warranted**]{.underline}. [Despite measures such as
**likelihood-adjusted mortality**]{.underline}, [which may suggest the
U.S. government]{.underline} [response is an
**overreaction**]{.underline}, [other characteristics of the bioweapons
threat **justify** its **securitization**]{.underline} [and resulting
**prioritization** in the]{.underline} **[government
agenda]{.underline}**. To do this, [the essay provides a discussion of
how the potential **consequences**]{.underline} of [an attack pose an
**existential threat**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [the United
States]{.underline}, how [there is an **inadequate degree**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[preparedness]{.underline}** for such an event, how
[the]{.underline} [**mere possibility** of an attack is enough to
warrant **high spending** on **preventive**]{.underline} and preparative
**[programs]{.underline}**, and how [the response has been
**appropriately measured**]{.underline} [given the threat]{.underline}.
The focus will be on the United States government because it has taken
such a prominent role in bioweapon securitization and biodefense
funding. A single country, the US, was chosen as a point of focus to
avoid confusion due to differing levels of threat and response across
countries. Additionally, any exaggerations that may exist in how the
media or the public portray and view the biological weapons threat will
be ignored; though this could be related to the government's decision to
securitize bioweapons, this is a separate issue from government policy
decisions in response to the security threat and is outside the scope of
this paper.

2\. Securitization Theory and Biological Weapons

Securitization theory is a constructivist approach informing how certain
issues become framed through a security lens6. It offers a useful
analytical framework for understanding how, why, and what issues come to
be viewed as security threats. [Securitization is an active
process]{.underline} wherein a [securitizing]{.underline}
[actor]{.underline}, in this case the American government, [presents and
addresses an issue as an **existential threat**]{.underline} [to
a]{.underline} particular [group, or referent]{.underline} object7. In
these situations, [emergency response measures and **extensive**
resource]{.underline} **[commitments]{.underline}** [are considered
**justified7**]{.underline}. [Securitization theory generally
promotes]{.underline} **[desecuritization]{.underline}**
[as]{.underline} **[preferable]{.underline}** because it avoids the
negative consequences of securitization, including a heavy-handed state
response, reduced democratic accountability, and the narrowing of public
choice8. [However, it also recognizes that **securitization** is
**sometimes appropriate**]{.underline}. Recent considerations of
securitization theory identify three criteria that, if fulfilled,
justify securitization: an objective, existential threat, a referent
object whose protection promotes human well-being, and a response
appropriately measured to the particular threat6.

In the case of bioweapons securitization, the second criterion is less
controversial, given that the referent object is human population; thus,
any harm to the referent object would directly reduce a human
well-being. However, the question of whether securitization of
biological weapons meets the other two criteria is more contentious.
[Skeptics]{.underline} may [point to Colin Powell's]{.underline} 2003
[address]{.underline} to the United Nations as a case where the
biological weapons security threat may have been exaggerated and
securitization was promoted for political ends, thereby [calling into
question the **legitimacy**]{.underline} of the securitizing actor, [the
U.S. government. In his speech, Powell made the case for an **invasion
of Iraq**]{.underline} [by claiming Iraq had capabilities to produce
**biological weapons**]{.underline} of mass destruction, including
mobile bioweapons labs, a claim that later turned out to be false9.

Critics also target the policies resulting from securitization, arguing
that the capacity of aggressors to carry out large scale attacks causing
mortality has been overestimated, calling into question whether an
existential threat truly exists and whether the response has been
appropriately measured10. Government funding may be seen as
unjustifiably skewed in favour of biodefense, defined as the capacity to
respond to a biological weapons attack, to the neglect of other key
areas, such as endemic and pandemic diseases. For instance, Klotz
calculated what is referred as the "likelihood-adjusted mortality" for
biological weapons, pandemic diseases, and endemic diseases by
multiplying the probability of occurrence by an estimate of mortality
were an event to occur11. By comparing these values with government
funding allocated to each category, he demonstrated that biodefense
receives more funding than its likelihood-adjusted mortality estimate
would suggest is warranted11.

[However]{.underline}, [objections have been raised to this
argument]{.underline}. [Supporters of **biodefense
prioritization**]{.underline} [point to the fact that focusing
**solely**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} **[potential
fatalities]{.underline}** [ignores **other issues,** such]{.underline}
[as the negative **social** and **economic fallout**]{.underline} [from
an attack12]{.underline}. Additionally, [they point to the possibility
that it is more **expensive**]{.underline} [to combat **intentional
threats**, where there will be an **explicit effort** to
**circumvent**]{.underline} current **[practices]{.underline}** [by
exploiting weaknesses12]{.underline}. It [should also be considered that
the **probability** of **one attack** is **not independent** from
another]{.underline}, [and that an increasing probability of **success**
may elicit]{.underline} **[more attempts12]{.underline}**. To follow
will be an examination of whether government spending and policies
constitute a justified response to the threat of biological weapons.
Securitization is relevant in that it was a way for decision-makers to
implement the policies they want and is justifiable to the extent that
the programs themselves are necessary and appropriate. Despite other
consequences of securitization, such as public fear, political
manipulation, and a heavy-handed response, which may give the impression
of an overreaction, the reality is that securitization was a means of
enabling the implementation of certain policies and programs necessary
to respond to the threat of biological weapons.

3\. [Consequences of an Attack]{.underline}

A government's decision to securitize an issue is a strategy to make
extreme responses seem justified, and it centers on the perceived
existential risk a threat poses to the population7. Beginning with a
brief history of biological weapons use, this section will aim to defend
the framing of biological weapons use as an existential threat by
examining their ability to cause mortality or to generate negative
social and economic fallout. A brief discussion of the potential
catastrophic consequences of a smallpox attack will illustrate the
argument.

[The use of **biological weapons** dates back
**centuries**]{.underline}. Examples include the Tatars catapulting
plague-infected corpses over city walls at the siege of Kaffa in the
14th century, the deliberate triggering of a smallpox epidemic among
Native Americans via contaminated blankets in the 18th century during
the French and Indian War, and the contamination of salad bars with
salmonella at a restaurant in Oregon in the 20th century2. However, with
the development of the germ theory during the 19th and into the 20th
century, there was an increase in scientific knowledge about biological
weapons10. States became increasingly interested in such weapons, with
Japan establishing a bioweapons program between 1932-1945, the United
States in 1942, and the Soviet Union in 197313. In 1972, in response to
increasing concern about the threat of biological weapons, the United
Nations proposed the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,
Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin
Weapons and on their Destruction, more commonly known as the Biological
Weapons Convention (or BWC)14. The treaty came into effect in 1975, and
banned the development, acquisition, and stockpiling of biological
weapons1. However, it failed to halt the research and development of
biological weapons, which have continued into the 21st century.

[Those who argue that government response to the **biological
weapons**]{.underline} [threat has been **overstated**]{.underline}
[point to very **low mortality**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
**[previous attacks11]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} [anthrax attacks
of 2001 in the United States, for example, resulted in only 5
deaths15]{.underline}. [This argument could be used to urge
**governments**]{.underline} [to instead invest resources in **areas**
that consistently cause **higher mortality**]{.underline}, [such as
**infectious diseases**]{.underline} like AIDS or even the seasonal flu.
[However, in carrying out a threat assessment, it is also important to
look at the **potential**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
**[mortality]{.underline}**. [Here it has been suggested future attacks
may **not** be on the same relatively **small**]{.underline}
**[scale]{.underline}** as [those in the past15. It is difficult to
produce **reliable estimates**]{.underline} of fatalities that might
result from an attack; there is huge variation in estimates and, often,
little statistical evidence to support the predictions11. That said, [it
is agreed that]{.underline}, in theory, [even **small
amounts**]{.underline} [of a dangerous biological agent could cause
**significant mortality** if prepared and disseminated
effectively16]{.underline}. For instance, the WHO estimates that [50kg
of B. anthracis]{.underline} [distributed upwind of a population of 500
000 would leave 95 000 people dead and 125 000 more
incapacitated17]{.underline}. Other sources suggest that 100kg of B.
anthracis, disseminated via a crop-sprayer, could kill as many as
**[three million people]{.underline}**, and comparable values have been
projected for other agents2,18. Another concern is that a contagious
biological agent will result in person-to-person transmission, creating
a self-sustaining effect not present in any other weapons class10.

While [mass casualties are **possible**]{.underline}, it is also
important to note that, [even in situations with **few
casualties**]{.underline}, [biological weapons attacks may have profound
**social** and **economic ramifications3**]{.underline}. [Such attacks
could lead to **widespread**]{.underline} social **[panic]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[disorder]{.underline}**, [resulting in
**self-destructive behaviour** and creating what is called a "**societal
autoimmune effect**" involving increases in crime and looting19. While
there is little evidence to predict this would]{.underline} occur based
on previous disaster situations (such as the terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001, where the public reaction is
described as effective and adaptive, rather than panicked and
disruptive), it must remain a consideration20. The effects of a
largescale attack involving biological weapons are unknown, and
epidemics of highly fatal diseases may cause serious social
disruption20.

[The]{.underline} **[economic consequences]{.underline}** of biological
weapons attacks [are **severe**]{.underline} [and suggest that investing
in defense makes **good** economic **sense**]{.underline}. While there
were only five deaths in the 2001 anthrax attacks, those attacks
resulted in tens of billions of dollars in government spending21. Also,
the financial sector may be negatively impacted if investor confidence
plummets3. Similarly, an attack on the agricultural sector, which
accounts for 15% of the United States GDP, could have severe economic
ramifications3. If the biological agent being used is contagious, there
could also be implications for trade and travel restrictions3. The SARS
epidemic of 2003 showed the economic consequences of a highly infectious
disease, essentially "crippling" some of the most dynamic cities in the
world4. The Center for Biosecurity has estimated the economic cost of a
biological weapons attack in the U.S. could exceed one trillion USD15.
In short, there are social and economic consequences that, considered in
conjunction with the potential for catastrophically high mortality,
justify the framing of biological weapons as a significant existential
threat to the United States. This is illustrated by considering the
specific case of smallpox.

[The Variola virus]{.underline}, which causes smallpox, [is an example
of an agent that, if weaponized and used in an attack, would pose a
serious **existential threat**]{.underline} [to the United]{.underline}
States22. It [is highly **contagious**]{.underline}; [in a]{.underline}
1972 [outbreak in Yugoslavia]{.underline}, even with routine
vaccinations, [which are no longer carried out, the **disease
spread**]{.underline} rapidly[, with each affected individual infecting
11 to 13 others23. It is also lethal, with a **30% fatality
rate1**]{.underline}. [Human populations are highly susceptible because,
since **eradication**, **vaccinations**]{.underline} [have not been
given for **20 years24**]{.underline}. [Other features make smallpox an
appealing option for **bioterrorism**]{.underline}: it has no treatment
once symptoms occur; it would not be detected for 7-17 days; it is
physically disfiguring; and the virus is stable in aerosol form1,24.
Perhaps the most problematic aspect of smallpox is that those infected
are contagious before symptoms appear. Simulations have been carried
out, including a 1999 exercise by the Center for Civilian Biodefense
Studies at Johns Hopkins University, where a terrorist release of
Variola virus grew into a global outbreak, which the health and
emergency response system was unable to control22. Here it could be
suggested that prevention efforts promoted by securitization are the
only option, given the apparent inability to contain a global outbreak
after an attack has occurred. While the dangers posed by the Variola
virus are not contested, skeptics argue that it is too difficult to
acquire to be a real danger10. However, there is significant concern
over unaccounted Soviet Union smallpox samples, and a 1999 U.S. report
pointed to evidence that secret stockpiles of the virus are held by
North Korea, Russia, and Iraq1,25. It has also been suggested that the
terrorist organization Aum Shinrikyo holds quantities of the Variola
virus22.

**[Threat]{.underline}** [and risk assessments should not rely solely on
the **worst-case scenarios**]{.underline} of biological weapons attacks,
[especially since practical challenges still limit terrorists' ability
to conduct attacks that will have the greatest possible effect. However,
it is **equally crucial**]{.underline} [to be aware of the wide
**range** of **consequences**]{.underline} [of such an
**attack**]{.underline}. [This section has argued that there could be
**serious ramifications** on several dimensions]{.underline},
[ramifications which **justify** the **framing** of]{.underline}
**[biological weapons]{.underline}** [as an **existential threat**
to]{.underline} the United States and warrant investment in an
appropriate response capacity. Securitization, therefore, played an
important role encouraging policy responses that were justified and

4\. Preparedness for an Attack

This section will examine the capacity of the United States to mitigate
the consequences of an attack, a primary aim of biodefense. For
government action to be justified[, the response must be
**appropriate**]{.underline} [to the given **threat
level**]{.underline}. The argument will be that this is the case with
biodefense programs, which must seek to address key weaknesses in the
preparedness system.

There is a general consensus that [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has insufficient
**capabilities**]{.underline} [to respond **effectively**]{.underline}
[to a **biological** weapons]{.underline} **[attack3]{.underline}**.
Three primary components of preparedness will be addressed: the ability
to detect an attack, the preparedness of the health care and emergency
response system to respond, and the medical countermeasures that
currently exist. It will be shown that there are important deficiencies
in all three of these areas, further suggesting that programs aimed at
developing a more appropriate response capacity are not overestimating
the threat but are both justified and necessary.

Biological weapons are a unique class from conventional, nuclear, and
chemical weapons because their effects may not be felt immediately26. It
could take days before it becomes apparent that an attack has taken
place; this is problematic as immediate treatment may be crucial to
survival27. Oral antibiotics for inhalational anthrax, for example,
should be administered within 48 hours of exposure, which leaves little
time for detection and delivery1. Any delay in detection could result in
a large number of casualties.

Additionally, if the weapon agent is contagious, failure to detect and
respond the attack may result in a greater spread of the infection. For
this reason, adequate detection capabilities are essential to
bioterrorism preparedness.

Unfortunately, [while funding for biodefense has led to
**improvements**]{.underline}, such as biosurveillance systems that seek
information on disease outbreaks, [there are still
**weaknesses**]{.underline} in the system15. [The systems are still
quite **rudimentary**]{.underline}, relying on a time-consuming process
of clinician reporting, laboratory diagnostics, and the phoning,
mailing, or faxing of reports15. To improve, biosurveillance must be
modernized. We need more effective electronic reporting, quick, cheap,
and reliable diagnostic tests, and the integration of public health
surveillance data with that from other sectors such as law and
intelligence agencies26. Currently, however, detection systems are not
able to detect biological agents at relatively low concentrations, or to
detect multiple biological agents with a single system, and they are not
sufficiently portable and user-friendly26. Detection ability is further
compromised by poor diagnostic capabilities in hospitals. One U.S. study
found that 91.2% of U.S. hospitals surveyed lacked the necessary
diagnostic technology to analyze and identify biological agents28.

Hospitals have been targeted as the weakest link in the preparedness
chain, in particular due to their inability to accommodate a sudden
influx of mass casualties29. It has been found that 60% of hospitals
lack such resources as the supplies, equipment, beds, and staff to
respond to a mass casualty situation28. Consequently, hospitals lack the
surge capacity to attend to patients; this could be disastrous in terms
of victims not receiving life-saving treatment, the failure to
quarantine infectious individuals, and the possibility of social
disorder as a result of public frustration. The problem is that
hospitals need far greater resources to respond to a bioterrorist attack
than they do for everyday functioning30. Practice scenarios have
demonstrated this resource shortage problem on more than one occasion. A
simulated attack on a U.S. city that involved the pneumonic plague
resulted in antibiotic shortages after just three days; the situation
worsened until, at the end of the weeklong simulation, 3700 cases of
plague had been identified and 2000 "deaths" had been reported31.

Also of concern is the overall inadequacy of medical countermeasures for
biological weapons, identified as one of the areas in greatest need of
attention15. Of the twelve biological agents identified as posing the
highest threat to the United States, only anthrax, smallpox, and
botulism receive substantial funding for medical countermeasure
development and acquisition15. One reason for this is that
pharmaceutical companies are not as motivated to fund research and
development addressing biological weapons since there is not as great a
commercial market as there is for chronic diseases and influenza15. Even
such practices as decontamination require funding and improvement. The
decontamination procedures for B. anthracis, previously used in the 2001
anthrax attacks, while effective, were also slow and expensive, and
could not be replicated in a situation with mass casualties15.

In the discussion above, it was argued that **[high government
funding]{.underline}** [is not **overestimated**]{.underline} [but is
**appropriate**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[justified]{.underline}** [to implement biodefense initiatives
required to **improve** response **capacity**]{.underline}. [This was
done by demonstrating that the United States is **ill-equipped** to deal
with a **significant** biological weapons **attack**, and that this
**lack** of **preparedness** risks further **exacerbating** the already
potentially **catastrophic consequences**]{.underline} of a biological
weapons attack. Securitization was useful in helping justify
prioritizing funding to address this issue.

5\. Probability of an Attack

The potentially disastrous consequences of an attack and the lack of
preparedness for such an event have been demonstrated, but perhaps [none
of that would matter]{.underline} (or justify prioritizing biodefense)
[if the probability of an **attack** by states]{.underline} or
terrorists **[was negligible]{.underline}**, due to an absence of
capacity or will to carry out a biological weapons attack on the United
States. This section will consider the likelihood of a biological
weapons attack in the United States by states or terrorist groups. This
issue is hotly contested, with some groups arguing that the chances of
an attack are much lower than popular fears and perceptions would
suggest, while others, like CIA Director Gross, believe it is "only a
matter of time", and predict another biological weapons attack on the
United States before 202028,32. As noted earlier, this essay's focus is
not on whether media rhetoric is inflated or public perceptions
unrealistic. Rather, it will be argued that the increasing availability
of biological weapons and the documented intent of various hostile
groups to acquire such weapons make an attack more likely. This is where
we see the relevance of the precautionary principle, as an uncertainty
surrounding the probability of an attack encourages us to adopt the
principle, promoting caution where funding is allocated in light of the
dire consequences that may arise were an attack to occur.

Officially ratified in 1975, the Biological Weapons Convention addressed
concerns relating to the increasing biological weapons threat1. While
commendable, the convention had important flaws including an absence of
any formal verification of compliance by states. For instance, after
signing the declaration, the Soviet Union continued to develop their
biological weapons program (unbeknownst to the global community)33.
Soviet defectors later confirmed the scale of their program, describing
a massive, covert operation34. Other countries have also been alleged to
have biological weapons programs, including Iraq, North Korea, Iran,
Libya, and Syria33,35. While Iraq has since claimed that its biological
weapons were all destroyed, this has been impossible to verify2.
Additionally, with the recent emergence of biotechnology industries in
low and middle-income countries, most notably Brazil and India, more
states are gaining advanced scientific capacity that could potentially
be applied to biological weapons development and production3. The key
here is that many states now have the scientific and technological
capacity to develop biological weapons, but there is a limited capacity
for national states or international organizations to monitor such a
process36.

In the BWC definition of biological weapons, the primary focus is on
intent---both in terms of the purpose of the microbial agent and the
delivery system1. Intent is the determining factor in the classification
of biological weapons, but this is extremely difficult to measure or
prove until after an act has been committed. In the biological sciences,
much research is readily applicable to justifiable ends (vaccines), as
well as hostile ones (biological weapons). The United States will often
accuse other states of hostile intent based solely on the presence of
pharmaceutical and biotechnological expertise necessary for biological
weapons development35. This can be viewed as an area of overreaction to
the bioweapons threat, illustrating how securitization processes seem to
legitimize some bad policy responses as well as good ones. Despite the
fact that most states could use this expertise to develop biological
weapons, the majority does not. This suggests that, while capacity is
present, the intent to use biological weapons is limited. In fact, over
the past century, there is only one confirmed case of a biological
weapons attack by one state on another: Japan's striking against China
in the 1930s and 1940s1. It has been suggested that reasons for this may
stem from fear of retaliation or the difficulties of controlling effects
on civilians and combatants1. Most countries possessing biological
weapons claim their purpose is to deter attacks or biological weapons
use by others35.

In [the past, the prospect]{.underline} of terrorists using biological
weapons [received **little attention3**]{.underline}. It [was generally
believed that terrorists would not be able to **engineer** biological
**weapons** because]{.underline} [they lacked access to the
**necessary** biological]{.underline} **[agents]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} technological **[capabilities]{.underline}**, [and the
specialized knowledge to weaponize and **disseminate** a biological
**weapon10**]{.underline}. Skeptics still believe that the advanced
genetic capabilities required to produce biological weapons will not be
available to terrorists in the near future3. For instance, the ability
to process a biological agent into aerosol form, the most effective
delivery method, requires expertise across a wide range of scientific
disciplines32. Also suspect is their ability to account for
environmental and meteorological conditions that may disrupt weapon
dissemination10, 32.

However[, a changing **global** and **scientific
landscape**]{.underline} [has led to a greater **potential**
for]{.underline} the **[acquisition]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[biological weapons]{.underline}** [capacity by terrorist groups. For
instance, during the Cold War, the Soviets reportedly employed
approximately **55, 000 scientists** and technicians at 6 **biological
weapons research labs**]{.underline} and 5 production facilities37.
[Among other things, smallpox was **weaponized** into ballistic
**missiles** and bombs38]{.underline}. In 1997, the United States
conducted a visit to one of these research labs to find that the
facility was half empty, poorly guarded, and that most of the scientists
had left39. It is, therefore, possible that the biological agents, the
equipment, and the human knowledge and expertise have since fallen into
the hands of rogue states or terrorist organizations. Additionally,
methods [of biological weapons production are now **freely accessible**
via the]{.underline} **[Internet]{.underline}**, [and the technological
requirements are not beyond the means of a determined, **well-funded**
terrorist **organization2**]{.underline}. Moreover, recent scientific
advances may support biological weapons production by enabling the
production of a higher yield of high-quality product36. They may also
support more effective weaponization, by making agents more resistant to
environmental hazards or by making agents targetable against specific
biochemical pathways36. As these capabilities spread across the globe,
there will be a greater potential for terrorists to harness and use
these techniques. While the capabilities of terrorists to engineer
biological weapons may have been overstated in the past, this can no
longer be said to be the case.

It has been argued that two of the preconditions for assessing the
threat of bioterrorism, vulnerability to an attack and terrorist
capability, are in place; the only remaining consideration is intent40.
It is important to determine whether the intent to acquire and use such
weapons is present among terrorist groups. While terrorist groups have
not often used biological weapons, it is unclear whether this is due to
insufficient capabilities or lack of intent1. There are a variety of
reasons why they may not be interested in the use of biological weapons,
including viewing such weapons as illegitimate in military combat, risks
of tactical failure, perceptions of high technical difficulty, and
concerns about the indiscriminate nature of a biological weapons
attack3. That said, various terrorist groups, including Aum Shinrikyo
and al Qaeda, have a documented interest in the acquisition of
biological weapons, and with advances in biotechnology and
weaponization, their use may become more attractive2, 41.

Experts also point to a shift in terrorist intent:
"**[post-modern]{.underline}**" [terrorism aims to inflict the highest
mortality rather than make **political statements** through
**violence33**. This makes **biological weapons** an **attractive
option** for such groups; one estimate suggests that the cost to cause
**civilian casualties**]{.underline} [is only one dollar per square
kilometer for **biological weapons**]{.underline}, compared to 800 and
2000 dollars per square kilometer for nuclear and conventional weapons,
respectively42. In a similar vein, the recent "war on terror" has
created an increasingly decentralized terrorist threat; biological
weapons are particularly well-suited to this form of smaller, more
informed terrorist groups28. In short, while the intent to use
biological weapons has been documented in terrorist groups in the past,
present circumstances may make the acquisition and use of biological
weapons more attractive.

To conclude, it is difficult to either predict or prevent a bioterrorism
attack, which makes any assessment of attack probability, by necessity,
subject to a high degree of estimation. However, due to the potential
severity of consequences of an attack, the precautionary principle
justifies the government decision to allocate spending according to the
severity of consequences, recognizing a situation where it is better to
overestimate than to underestimate the probability of an attack. As
argued by Michael Moodie of the Chemical and Biological Arms Control
Institute, "The odds (of bioterrorism) are increasing...we have to walk
a fine line between hyping the risk...and trying to convince people that
it is a possibility for which we need to invest resources"2.

6\. Biodefense Funding

The essay's previous sections have argued that a biological weapons
attack would pose an existential threat to the United States, that there
is an inadequate capacity to respond to such an event, and that the
possibility exists for such an attack to occur. This would suggest that
a substantial amount of government funding should be allocated towards
addressing this threat. The decision to securitize bioweapons
facilitated this process. Critics who believe the threat has been
overstated often argue that the government should not invest so heavily
in biodefense, but instead, improve other sectors, such as reducing
mortality from endemic disease11. Meanwhile, proponents may argue that a
securitized issue should receive more funding than issues that are not
framed as an existential threat4. This section will argue that the
response, in terms of government spending, is justified in that it seeks
to protect the public and has not exaggerated the threat of
bioterrorism. This will be demonstrated by examining the degree of
investment in biodefense, showing that a relatively small amount is
allocated specifically to biodefense.

In 2000, the United States federal budget proposed that 10 billion USD
be allocated to counterterrorism programs, an increase of 3.3 billion
dollars from the previous year10. This covered all forms of terrorism,
but there was a greater focus on biological terrorism than in the past,
with spending on medical countermeasures and defense measures increasing
fourfold from 91 million USD in 1998 to 336.6 million in 20002. These
trends intensified after the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent
"Amerithrax" scare. While estimates vary, the consensus is that, since
2001, the United States government has invested between 50 and 100
billion USD towards research and development in response to the
perceived threat of a biological weapons attack43.

One calculation posited that the U.S. allocated 54.39 billion USD to
civilian biodefense programs between 2001 and 201044. This did not
include allocations to Bioshield, a program designed to address the lack
of adequate medical countermeasures for terrorist attacks; 8.7 billion
USD has been allocated since 200445. However, of civilian biodefense
funding, 42.57 of the 54.39 billion USD was directed towards programs
with multiple goals beyond biodefense improvement, such as basic
infectious disease research, programs to improve public health planning
and operations, and improving preparedness for a range of disasters44.
One example is the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
Hospital Preparedness Program, which seeks to improve surge capacity in
healthcare facilities44. Some estimates suggest that up to 92% of
biodefense funding has been directed to programs that serve secondary
purposes, such as improving preparedness for disease pandemics and
natural disasters15.

One could argue that the amounts dedicated to biodefense as a percentage
of entire budgets are not very substantial given the existential threat
posed by an attack. The DHHS, the largest recipient of federal
biodefense funding, has a budget of 879 billion USD, of which biodefense
made up only 0.5%44. Similarly, biodefense makes up less than 1% of the
Department of Homeland Security budget, and only 0.10% of the Department
of Defense Budget44. Accordingly, it could be argued that the bioweapons
threat does not, in fact, take as high a priority in terms of government
funding as one might expect, given the associated security risk.
Additionally, almost all of the increases in investments have arisen
from new funding; other sectors are not suffering at the expense of
biodefense prioritization12.

High funding is appropriate independent of any controversy relating to
estimates of attack probability, as the precautionary principle would
suggest that decisive action is warranted given the potential for dire
consequences, even with a low probability of the event occurring. These
figures show that the funding response is not an overreaction but has
been justified and appropriate given the documented threat of biological
weapons, targeting programs that are likely to protect the public.

7\. Conclusion

The anthrax attacks of 2001 are a case where biological weapons were
used against the United States in the absence of any direct provocation.
Since then, though the issue is controversial, biological weapons have
been considered an important threat to U.S. security. [This
essay]{.underline} has [defended the **securitization**]{.underline} [of
the **biological weapons threat** as a means to an end]{.underline}. It
[is a process to engage in where it is necessary to get **approval** for
**policies**]{.underline} [that are]{.underline}, in themselves,
**[necessary]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[justified]{.underline}**. [By analyzing the **existential threat**
posed by **bioweapons**, the lack of **preparedness** by the United
States for such an event, and the possibility of an attack, evidence
presented in this essay suggests that **these policies** and the overall
government response **were appropriate**]{.underline}. Taking these
issues into account, the essay concluded that the threat of bioterrorism
has not been overestimated; it warrants securitization and the resulting
response measures. Moving forward now, government must recognize and
respond to the reality of an increasing bioterrorism threat.

Although often perceived as a recent invention, **[biological weapons
have been used for hundreds of years.]{.underline}** During the siege of
Kaffa (now Feodossia, Ukraine) in 1346, [the Tatars catapulted the dead
bodies of plague victims into the city, causing an epidemic among the
inhabitants.]{.underline} [The subsequent migration of refugees from the
defeated city may have caused the second European plague
pandemic.]{.underline}3 In the 18th century, [Sir Jeffrey Amhurst
deliberately caused a smallpox epidemic among hostile Native American
tribes by giving them contaminated hospital blankets.]{.underline} [The
effect on the Indian population was devastating.4]{.underline}

**[Recent use of biological agents to cause deliberate harm has only
rarely been described in the medical literature, with approximately one
report per decade.]{.underline}** [During the 1960s, several outbreaks
of typhoid and dysentery in Japanese hospitals were caused by
intentional food poisoning by a bacteriologist]{.underline}.5 [In 1970,
four Canadian students developed asthma, eosinophilia and pulmonary
infiltrates after consuming food deliberately infected with Ascaris suum
ova.]{.underline}6 **[During a single month in 1985 in Dalles, Oregon,
751 people developed salmonella gastroenteritis after contamination of
salad bars by the Rajneeshee religious cult]{.underline}**.7 [Most
recently in 1996, 12 laboratory staff developed dysentery after
intentional contamination of muffins by a colleague.]{.underline}8
Although these amateurish attempts seem relatively minor, **[many
experts regard bioterrorism as capable of causing death and
incapacitation to tens of thousands of people.]{.underline}**

The former Congressional Office of Technology Assessment reported that
**[a small aeroplane carrying 100 kg of anthrax spores could use a
crop‐sprayer to deliver a fatal dose to 3 million
people.]{.underline}**9 A report by the World Health Organization
estimated that [if an aeroplane released 50 kg of anthrax over a 2 km
line, upwind of a population of 500 000 people, 95 000 people could be
killed and 125 000 incapacitated.]{.underline}10 Other agents could also
cause significant morbidity and mortality (Table 1). **[The bioterrorist
was prominent among an increasingly alarmist cast of menacing characters
in the post9/11 national imaginary]{.underline}**. [A series of hoaxes
alleging the use of anthrax in several US states between October and
December 1998 produced emergency reactions from local and state health
departments, CDC and the FBI. Businesses were temporarily closed, and
many people were decontaminated and given antibiotic prophylaxis before
the use of anthrax was excluded.1]{.underline}

**[Smallpox is potentially the most dangerous bioterrorist weapon
because of its infectivity in aerosol form, case fatality of 30% and
high patient‐to‐patient transmission rate]{.underline}**. [The world\'s
population has become increasingly susceptible to smallpox because of
the discontinuation of vaccination, and probably **only 20% of the
population are now protected.**]{.underline}15 [Clinical features
include malaise, fever, rigors, vomiting, headache, backache, delirium
and an erythematous rash]{.underline}. Over the following week, [the
patient develops mucous membrane lesions, which shed virus particles,
and a rash which progresses from macules to papules to pustular
vesicles.]{.underline} In contrast to varicella, the skin lesions are
all present at the same stage of development. Patients are regarded as
infectious until all of the scabs separate.22 [**Many exposed patients
may shed virus from the oropharynx without developing the disease and
cause further virus transmission.**23]{.underline}

**[A high degree of awareness is required to diagnose smallpox, because
it can easily be confused with varicella, erythema multiforme or
allergic dermatitis.]{.underline}** Pharyngeal swabs and skin scrapings
are required for virus isolation, ELISA and PCR. [Samples from any
suspected patient must be processed in a biosafety category 4
facility.]{.underline} [**Clinicians should not be complacent that this
disease is extinct, because** recognition of **a single confirmed case
would be an international emergency**, and prompt diagnosis and
appropriate precautions could save many lives]{.underline}. [**Strict
quarantine**, including respiratory isolation, **is required for anyone
in contact with the patient, as infection can occur even if the patient
is 10 m away.19**]{.underline}

[**There is no known treatment for smallpox**, although cidofovir is
effective in vitro and could be used.]{.underline}21 [Smallpox vaccine
would need to be given to all potentially exposed
individuals]{.underline}. **[The US has only 5--7 million doses of
smallpox vaccine stored and there is currently no facility to produce
further vaccine.]{.underline}** Therefore[, **if a terrorist group began

[During the Gulf War, **the US stockpiled 30 million doses of
ciprofloxacin in the zone of operations to protect troops in case of an
anthrax attack**.**4 Iraq produced enormous quantities of anthrax**, and
it is possible that **some of this is now in the possession of terrorist
groups.**]{.underline} Aerosolized anthrax spores would cause the
inhalational form of disease (traditionally known as woolsorters\'
disease). [After a 1--5 day incubation period, the patient develops a
prodromal illness characterized by fever, malaise, nonproductive cough
and chest discomfort]{.underline}. [A 2--3 day asymptomatic period
may]{.underline} then [occur, or the patient may progress directly to
fulminant disease with severe dyspnoea, stridor, cyanosis, septic shock,
meningitis and death]{.underline}. **[Once symptoms occur, inhalational
anthrax is usually fatal despite antibiotic treatment.]{.underline}**

Diagnosis is made by blood culture and ELISA. The patient does not
require isolation as person‐to‐person transmission does not occur.
[Treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin and supportive therapy are
required. Anyone exposed to an anthrax attack requires prophylaxis with
a 4‐week course of oral ciprofloxacin or doxycycline.]{.underline}21
**[The US military has stocks of an anthrax vaccine, although there are
insufficient data in humans regarding the protective efficacy of the
vaccine]{.underline}** following inhalational exposure.21

**[Deliberate aerosolized release of anthrax would cause major problems
for medical services]{.underline}**. [The exact location of release may
be uncertain,]{.underline} due to the disease incubation period, [and
identifying those who have potentially been exposed may prove
impossible.]{.underline} [It is possible to develop sudden onset of
illness up to 8 weeks after exposure.]{.underline} Therefore anyone
developing non‐specific influenza‐like symptoms could be suffering from
the prodromal illness. **[An appropriate public health warning would
need to be issued and hospitals and general practitioners might then be
swamped by an understandably panic‐stricken public.]{.underline}**

resulting in 774 deaths]{.underline}**, according to data from the World

about securitizing actors. [Although SARS originated in China and
disproportionately afflicted Chinese citizens (5327 infected and 349
dead), **Chinese authorities were not the first to securitize the
disease; rather this role fell to WHO and a retired Chinese military
doctor** who posted his concerns on the web.]{.underline} In fact
Chinese leaders initially sought to desecuritize SARS. Despite the
tendency of the Copenhagen School to treat desecuritization as a
desirable outcome, indicating the end of extreme measures and their
resulting negative impacts on social freedoms**[, in the case of SARS,
desecuritization actually led to further restrictions on freedom of
expression.]{.underline}** [The first incidence of SARS (initially
called atypical pneumonia) was reported in Guangdong province in
mid-November 2002, but Chinese provincial officials withheld information
about the disease from the general public for another 3
months]{.underline}. On 11 February 2003, the Guangdong government
finally made a statement about the disease, the same day that the
official Communist Party newspaper, People\'s Daily, announced on its
website that the province had succeeded in controlling the outbreak,
though five deaths were reported (Congressional- Executive Commission on
China 2003: 2; Huang 2003: 10). **[SARS then spread to Hong Kong later
in February 2003, after a visiting doctor from Guangdong developed
symptoms, and then continued to spread globally]{.underline}**. Although
the territory would go on to play a key role in publicizing and
countering the disease, the story of SARS in Hong Kong is not included
in this case study, as the securitization dynamics played out quite
differently there than on the mainland, due to the more open social and
political environment in the Special Administrative Region (on SARS in
Hong Kong, see Loh 2004; Abraham 2005). [The timing of the new disease
was especially unfortunate for the Chinese leadership; coinciding with a
period of leadership change, spanning from the 16th Communist Party
Congress in November 2002 to the National People\'s Congress in March
2003]{.underline}. The Chinese Ministry of Health reportedly sent a team
to Guangdong to investigate in late January, but the results were
classified \'top secret\' and no nation-wide health advisory was issued
until 3 April (Huang 2003: 9-10). [The Chinese government also refused
to cooperate with WHO until April 2003. **Desecuritization in this
instance turned out to be far from optimal, resulting in the spread of
the disease throughout China and globally, as well as in the restriction
of information on public health inside and outside the
country**]{.underline}. Securitization The Copenhagen School assumes
that securitizing actors are collectivities, or at least their
designated representatives who enjoy a position of authority. Because a
successful securitization involves convincing an audience of the urgency
of a particular threat, most Copenhagen School scholars tend to discount
the likelihood of individuals accomplishing a securitizing move (Buzan
1997: 19; Buzan et al. 1997: 33, 40-41; Huysmans 1998: 493; Hansen 2000:
289), though others emphasize that what really matters is the speaker\'s
social capital (Vuori 2008: 77), positional power (Stritzel 2007: 364)
or relationship to the audience (Balzacq 2005: 272). [The SARS case
raises new questions about securitizing actors and the role of the
audience. Although in the case of SARS the initial securitizing move
came from an international organization - the WHO, which issued a global
health alert on 12 March 2003, followed by an emergency travel
advisory]{.underline} on 15 458 HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING (Caballero-
Anthony 2005: 479) - it was a lone whistleblower who began the
securitization process inside China.

### 1AR\-\--De-Securitization Worse

#### In order to counter over securitization, many turn to de-securitization, but that is not the best option. Securitization can be good, as long as checks and balances are set in advance and can be enforced

Given the spectre of exceptionalism that comes with security, research
in the tradition of the Copenhagen School has focused mostly on averting
securitizations that facilitate emergency measures (see Roe, 2008;
Wæver, 2000: 253--254). [It has been claimed that a securitizing move
that shifts an issue from normal politics into the realm of the
exception needs to be countered by an explicit desecuritizing move that
shifts the issue back to the normal by discursively undermining the
threat construction]{.underline} (Hansen, 2012: 542--545; Huysmans,
1995: 65--67; 1998; Roe, 2004: 285--287).8 [Such a conception of
securitization and desecuritization presents several ways back to normal
politics.]{.underline} [However, it also reproduces the categorical
belief that there are only two possible political forms: 'non-security'
(associated with normal politics) and 'security' (associated with the
logic of war)]{.underline} (see Figure 1). This perspective is
conceptually constraining because [non-security is not always an option:
on one hand, **desecuritizing moves may simply not be successful because
desecuritizers lack discursive authority or because their discursive
strategies do not resonate with the relevant audiences**]{.underline}
(see Buzan et al., 1998: 26). On the other hand, [non-security may be
undesirable owing to the negative side-effects that desecuritization can
produce]{.underline} -- for example, by undermining legitimate claims to
protect vulnerable groups (Roe, 2004). [Without an alternative to
desecuritization, this would mean letting the logic of war
unfold.]{.underline}

The alternative we propose here is based on the assumption that there is
little reason to accept that speaking about security concerns
necessarily leads to the use of full emergency measures. Paul Roe (2004:
292--293) has argued convincingly that securitized issues can be
managed. While the language of security remains present, its effects can
be mitigated (see also Tjalve, 2011). As the debate on the state of
exception among legal theorists shows[**, there are different ways of
constitutionally dealing with emergencies that foresee particularly the
taming of sovereign power through constitutional
containmen**t]{.underline} (see Dyzenhaus, 2006; Ferejohn and Pasquino,
2004; Gross, 2003; Scheuermann, 2006). For example, what has been termed
the 'accommodation model' of exceptionalism is based on the
understanding that it would be unrealistic to think that the existing
constitutional order could remain completely untouched during times of
crisis. [Nevertheless, the basic pillars of the constitution need to be
protected and the legal order should therefore have mechanisms ready to
keep an emergency within these constitutional confines]{.underline}
(Ackermann, 2004; Gross, 2003: 1043--1044; Tushnet, 2005). Thus, from a
legal theory perspective, [one important alternative and complement to
desecuritization is constitutional accommodation]{.underline} (see
Figure 1). [It is an alternative in sofar as it mitigates the effects of
securitizations that cannot be avoided. However, it is also
complementary to discursive desecuritization because it counteracts the
tendencies of the emergency trap outlined earlier]{.underline} -- in
other words, it removes or mitigates a precondition for further
securitizations (see also White, 2013: 14--15 for the inverse approach).

[Such confines can be both ex ante and ex post constitutional checks on
discretionary powers]{.underline}. Ex ante, **[both the initiation and
the scope of emergency measures can be constrained.]{.underline}**
Regarding the initiation of emergency rule[, **Schmittian decisionism**
-- according to which the sovereign themself determines the exception --
**can be countered by functionally separating the decision on the
presence or absence of an emergency and the decision on the means to
overcome it**]{.underline}. This is seen as a fundamental precondition
for keeping emergency rule 'constitutional' (Rossiter, 1948: 299--300).
[At the IO level, this could mean that a member-state body or other
subcommittee is entitled to formally invoke the state of exception and
that only then can an IO organ decide on emergency
measures]{.underline}. [The range of available emergency measures can be
circumscribed so that the sovereign's discretion does not trespass on
elementary rules and rights even in the state of emergency.]{.underline}

**[In addition, IO emergency powers can be contained ex post with the
help of accountability mechanisms.]{.underline}** As scholars in the
literature on emerging global administrative law argue, **[basic
principles of domestic administrative law]{.underline}** -- and thereby
mechanisms of political and judicial review -- **[can and should be
instituted within the international legal system to increase IO
accountability]{.underline}** (see Kingsbury et al., 2005).[9
Accountability can take the form of political review, whereby an
interstate assembly or executive board watches over IO emergency
powers]{.underline}. [Legal review, in turn, can be achieved by either a
legal counsel or an internal review panel to assess the lawfulness of
the actions of IOs]{.underline}. In addition[, inter-institutional
processes of steering and control can contribute to the review of an
IO's deployment of emergency competencie]{.underline}s (Kingsbury and
Casini, 2009: 337). [**An important side-effect of accountability
mechanisms is that they enhance the transparency and public scrutiny of
IO activities**.]{.underline} [This may also prove to be positive
feedback for desecuritization efforts by opening the possibility of
discursively contesting the securitizing moves of IOs.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} **[De-escalation]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[Military Efforts]{.underline}** in Combating Flu

From the earlier discussion, it is clear there is an established
pedigree of military interest and involvement in combating influenza
driven primarily by concerns regarding the disease's impact on troop
readiness and the perception that pandemic influenza was contemporaneous
with conflict. [The post--World War II era]{.underline}, however,
[witnessed a progressive reduction in **militaries' role**]{.underline}
[in combating the **disease**,]{.underline} [manifest in the
**decommissioning**]{.underline} [of military-led **influenza
programs**]{.underline} [and a reduced role in policy.]{.underline} We
contend that there were three main axes that underlay this effective
deescalation of military influenza efforts.

[The first of these was the rise of the **international
institutions**]{.underline} [of public health in the postwar period
leading to the mandate of **combating pandemic**]{.underline} [influenza
shift from a military to **civilian focus**]{.underline}. [Primary among
these was the creation of the World Health Organization]{.underline}
(**[WHO]{.underline}**) [that was established in 1948 as the United
Nations']{.underline} specialized [agency for public
**health**]{.underline}, and which took an active role in coordinating
the international response to influenza. In 1952, the WHO established
the global influenza surveillance network (GISN) that was charged
primarily with identifying strains of influenza in common circulation,
thus allowing the WHO to provide technical support to member states in
managing influenza outbreaks. [This network **replaced**
what]{.underline} was in some states [the]{.underline} traditional
mandate of the **[military establishment]{.underline}**, such as the
Walter Reed influenza surveillance system, which until the late 1950s
played a key role in pandemic detection and policy in the United States
(and Downloaded from afs.sagepub.com at TUFTS UNIV on December 8, 2015
was also responsible for rapidly isolating the 1957 Asian flu strain and
issuing initial warnings of a pandemic).83 When the ''Asian flu''
pandemic emerged in 1957, the GISN played a leading role in managing the
global response, utilizing its international networks to collate and
analyze statistical data to identify trends and effective public health
measures.84 In 1959, under an edict from the expert committee on
respiratory viruses, the WHO encouraged outposts of the GISN into closer
engagement with national public health authorities of their host member
states, officially recommending:

> that the laboratory network originally organized under the programme
> should be brought into closer relationship with national public health
> authorities. This is necessary for two reasons---first, in order that
> the influenza centre of the country may be alerted to, and may
> organize the investigation of, outbreaks in distant parts of the
> country, of which it might otherwise not learn in time, and secondly
> so that the centre may keep the health authorities informed of the
> appearance of unusual viruses or epidemics elsewhere in the world and
> of the appropriate technical measures which should be taken.85

[This move encouraged member states' **ministries of
health**]{.underline}, [rather than **militaries**]{.underline}, [to
take greater carriage of **national influenza programs**]{.underline}
[through their partnership with the WHO]{.underline}.

[For the United States, the embedding of influenza research in the
**civilian sector**]{.underline} was [also driven by the implementation
of the **Vannevar Bush plan**, a conspectus that outlays the American
postwar agenda for scientific **research**]{.underline}. [In it, Bush
proposed limiting military-based research to that involving the
''improvement of **existing weapons''**]{.underline} [only]{.underline},
[officially recommending that]{.underline}:

> Some research on military problems should be conducted, in time of
> peace as well as in war, by civilians independently of the military
> establishment. It is the primary responsibility of the Army and Navy
> to train the men, make available the weapons, and employ the strategy
> that will bring victory in combat. The Armed Services cannot be
> expected to be experts in all of the complicated fields which make it
> possible for a great nation to fight successfully in total war\... the
> job of long-range research involving application of the newest
> scientific discoveries to military needs should be the responsibility
> of those civilian scientists in the universities and in industry who
> are best trained to discharge it thoroughly and successfully.86

[The second factor contributing to the de-escalation of military
influenza work was the **absence** of a **second catastrophic
pandemic**]{.underline} [that effectively undermined perceptions of the
**strategic threat** of the malady compared with the antecedent
**Spanish flu**. The]{.underline} **[normalization]{.underline}** [of
influenza **vaccines**]{.underline} at [the close of World War II found
fast utility in responding to **emergent pandemics**]{.underline}.
[Armed with new vaccine technology, nations such as the United States
and Britain responded to the 1957 Asian Flu pandemic with large-scale
programs to **vaccinate** their **citizens**]{.underline}.87 For the
United States, the efficacious use of vaccines coupled with the low
morbidity of the influenza strain meant that the impact on national
interests was only marginal.88 Henderson et al. noted little discernible
impact on industry or on the economy at large.89 Fred Davenport, then
director of the AFEB Commission on Influenza, also observed during the
peak pandemic period that, ''there had been no disruption of essential
activities in either civilian or military communities.''90 In a 1959
report from the WHO, it was subsequently noted that ''experience in many
countries has now established vaccination as the most efficient method
for the prevention of influenza,'' offering governments a powerful tool
for combating the disease.91 This experience was then replicated in the
1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak where medical interventions and an influenza
strain of low morbidity resulted in a pandemic of relatively low
severity.92 The optimism that accompanied the perceived diminishing
threat of pandemic influenza was reflected in a statement by US Surgeon
General in 1970 that that ''the war against pestilence \[is\] won.''93
It was also manifest in a decision by the US Army in 1971 to abolish the
AFEB Commission on Influenza, in part because ''the growing
effectiveness of the prevention of disease \[has\] materially lessened
the requirement for AFEB assistance in both field investigations and the
organization of contract research.''94

A second approach focuses on why cyber norms emerge only slowly,
building on the existing IR norms literature (Finnemore & Hollis, 2016).
Early works in this area focused on the debate among states, especially
at the United Nations, followed by a growing number of proposal from the
private and the civil sector (Hurwitz, 2014). However, cyber norms
remain contested at the international level (Grisby, 2017). More
recently, the interest of researchers shifted to the role of the
creators (mostly private entities) and exploiters (sub-, semi-, and
non-state actors) of digital technologies in shaping the behavioral
standards that new regulation needs to take into account (Hurel &
Lobato, 2018). **[States]{.underline}** [need to know how their
**intelligence services**]{.underline} [work in cyberspace, because
through their **tools** and **practices**]{.underline} [they set
practical norms of acceptable (**cyber) espionage**]{.underline} with
[far-reaching effects on **state behavior** in]{.underline}
**[cyberspace]{.underline}** (Georgieva, 2019). [The focus on the role
of **intelligence** agencies in cyber conflict]{.underline}--as [both
the biggest threat and the most **capable provider** of]{.underline}
**[safety]{.underline}**--[opens up interesting questions linked to the
**larger transformation**]{.underline} [of these agencies in the context
of the **digitization of society**]{.underline}. [Some authors argue
that cyber conflict is primarily an **intelligence game**]{.underline},
because setting up cyber exploitation is much more expensive than
countering released exploitation, which increases the incentive to keep
the target at risk (Lindsay, 2017).

A third approach explores the broader repercussion of cyber conflict
dynamics for government and governance. The concept of networked
governance seems especially apt at capturing the essence of cyberspace
as co-constituted by technical devices and networks and socio-political
institutions (Hofmann, 2016). The key governance challenge in cyberspace
is fragmentation of authority and accountability. A case in point is the
lack in public transparency and trusted knowledge about the perpetrators
behind most cyber incidents. Although the number of public attributions
of cyber incidents by states and threat intelligence firms has been on
the rise, both types of actors have political and economic reasons not
to fully disclose their evidence (Egloff, 2019). As a consequence,
attribution claims remain contested in the public domain, undermining
the legitimacy of state action--from insurance matters and criminal
proceedings to mechanism of international cooperation and potentially
escalation control.

Cluster 3: Securitization, practice, and assemblages

Looking back at the beginnings of the cyber threat story, the policy
debate was riddled with cyber-doom scenarios and constant attempts to
mobilize in the political process. As a reaction to what was considered
a "hype," some scholars started to get interested in why and how this
issue was presented the way it was and with what consequences. Early
work to analyze the issues surrounding the politics of Internet from IR
and critical security studies perspectives emerged at the end of the
1990s (Deibert, 2002; Eriksson, 2001; Saco, 1999). A bit later, there
was a concentrated effort to apply variations of securitization theory
to the issue of cyber security politics (cf. Dunn Cavelty, 2008; Hansen
& Nissenbaum, 2009; Lawson, 2013). Securitization signifies the
representation of a fact, a person, or a development as a danger for the
military, political, economic, ecological, and/or social security of a
political collective and the acceptance of this representation by the
respective political addressee (Buzan, Waever, & De Wilde, 1998). The
successful securitization of a topic justifies the use of all available
means to counter it--including those outside the normal political rules
of the game.

Following the theory, the prime questions this literature engaged with
were related to the object of security, to what or whom was considered
the main threat, and to what policy responses flowed from these threat
constructions (Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010). Given its theoretical
underpinnings, the Copenhagen School focuses mainly on official
statements by heads of state, high-ranking officials or heads of
international institutions (Hansen, 2006, p. 64). What a focus on elite
speech acts ignores, however, is how these discursive practices are
facilitated or prepared by practices of actors that are not so easily
visible. The social competition for the definition of reality is not
only held in the open political arena. There are always state and
nonstate actors "under the radar"--that is, specialized bureaucratic
units, consultants or other experts--which have the capacity to
establish "the truth" about certain threats, thus pre-structuring the
discursive field in relevant ways (Huysmans, 2006, p. 72).

Cyber security, so the common assumption, arises from the interaction of
technologies, processes, and everyday practices. Thus, the literature
pays particular attention to how a variety of actors uses different
representations of danger to create or change different political,
private, social, and commercial understandings of security in selected
public spheres. In addition, it gives more weight to material aspects of
the issue in the tradition of STS (Balzacq & Dunn Cavelty, 2016;
Collier, 2018; Shires, 2018; Stevens, 2016), looking at the
co-constitution of technology and politics. In particular, it recognizes
that the political reading of cyber security cannot be divorced from
particular knowledge practices in different communities.

As the most recent research focus to emerge, literature in this cluster
covers a variety of topics, united by a focus on understanding how cyber
security emerges as an assemblage of people, objects, and enacted ideas.
Questions of authority and power are most directly addressed by research
in this cluster. C. Stevens (2019) sets out to better understand the
role of cyber security companies by looking at Symantec's analysis of
Stuxnet and the publication of their reports in the public. Tanczer
(2019) focuses on the increasingly blurred boundaries between field of
security professionals and hackers, pointing to changes in the larger
context of security and insecurity that are reflected in the practices
of these technical experts and in the conception of them. Shires (2019)
looks at how the cyber security industry portrays cyberspace as a
terrain of persistent threat, systemic vulnerability, and intelligence
ambiguity, a classic "noir" narrative that results from systemic
economic deficiencies (distorted incentives for protection) and from
systemic political deficiencies (black markets for new exploits). By
focusing on non-traditional actors and aspects of politics, this type of
research is able to make invisible aspects of cyber security visible.

Conclusion: [Where is **cyber security**]{.underline}
[politics]{.underline} research [headed]{.underline}?

[Over the past decade, **research** in **cyber security**]{.underline}
[politics has seen the emergence of a **growing**
interdisciplinary]{.underline} **[body]{.underline}** [of work that is
at the same time **theoretically informed**]{.underline}, [grounded in
**empirical observations**, and **policy-relevant** in many of its
insights. We have ended our **intellectual history** by outlining three
research clusters. In place]{.underline} of a summary of the past and
present evolution of cyber security as a security political issue, we
want to look into a possible future of research on cyber security
politics in this concluding section. We do this based on the same
assumption discussed at the beginning of this article: that the
trajectory of both cyber security research and cyber security policy
will continue to be shaped by the interplay between technology,
politics, and science. The direction in which research and policy will
move will be co-constituted by technological possibilities, political
choices, and scientific practices. We end our intellectual history with
a brief outlook on likely developments in all three areas.

Digital technologies have politics, and technological possibilities and
developments will require new governance mechanisms, while at the same
time being shaped by politics. First, the interconnectedness between
ever more complex socio-technical systems is bound to increase. Cyber
security will grow in importance as a topic as countries all around the
world strive to shape digital transformation processes that affect
society, economy, and the state alike. In the context of what has been
called fourth industrial revolution, the complexity of socio-technical
systems will increase due the ubiquitous digitalization and automation
of technical processes that support a great variety of socio-political
institutions. As these technical system become tighter coupled and
integrate more aspects of society and economy, cyber security concerns
will inevitably expand to more policy fields at both the national and
international level. These developments will create new demands for
technical and organizational research that needs to be better integrated
with approaches from the social and political science.

Second, cyberspace will become increasingly dependent on space-based
technologies and interlinked with newly emerging technologies in the
fields of quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). This will
increase the size of cyberspace. More importantly, as an enabling
technology with diverse applications in all areas of life, AI will link
cyberspace to more policy fields. AI will become an essential element of
cyber security and will have a profound impact on the speed, scale,
duration, autonomy, and complexity of cyber operations, for both offense
and defense. These new technologies will be primarily developed by
global technology firms and the private sector. As a consequence, state
actors will likely become more dependent on technology firms and
independent technology experts, further transforming the relationship
between public and private actors. The fact that there is considerable
**[uncertainty]{.underline}** regarding the tempo and scope of these
technological [developments creates new demands for
**research**]{.underline} [that maps, assesses, models, and]{.underline}
**[forecasts]{.underline}** [new **technological
possibilities**]{.underline}. [As social scientists, we need to
understand the increasingly salient **political** and]{.underline}
social **[aspects]{.underline}** [that will affect the patterns of
**cooperation**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[conflict]{.underline}** in politics and society at the national and
international level.

**[Political choices]{.underline}** [at the **national**]{.underline}
and international **[level]{.underline}** [have a **technological
dimension**. Politics will **influence** and **govern
technology**]{.underline} [development while at the same time being
**pre-structured** by **technology**]{.underline}. [First, we can expect
that **political**]{.underline} and military **[actors]{.underline}**
[will attempt to better understand the (limited) **strategic
utility**]{.underline} [of cyber operations below the level of **armed
conflict**]{.underline}, [in order to find the right balance between
**restraint** and **exploitation**]{.underline}. [One key challenge in
this context is ho**w best** to **manage** the]{.underline}
**[transformation]{.underline}** of [state intelligence services in the
digital age and their **growing dependence**]{.underline} on private
intelligence firms. Another key challenge is linked to information
operations and propaganda that might be spread more targeted and
effectively via AI technologies and social media platforms. These
political developments raise important research questions that require
interdisciplinary answers.

Second, public actors will uphold their efforts to control the risk of
escalation trough international cooperation. [States cannot secure
cyberspace on their own, without taking into account **market** and
**social forces**; yet no]{.underline} **[stable cyber
governance]{.underline}** [framework will emerge without greater
**convergence** on **responsible behavior**]{.underline} [among **great
powers**]{.underline}. [As long as great powers
**disagree**]{.underline} [about what represents responsible use of
**cyber operations** in]{.underline} **[state
interactions]{.underline}**, and [for that matter what forms of
espionage and interference in the political process of other states
through cyberspace are acceptable, **little** top-down
**progress**]{.underline} [will materialize]{.underline}. **[Bottom-up
progress]{.underline}**, [on the other hand, presupposes that the actors
become **more visible**]{.underline} [for each other in order to
**successfully work together**]{.underline} [in a multi-stakeholder
framework]{.underline}. **[Research]{.underline}** [can shed light on
**invisible actors** and **analyze**]{.underline} [the interaction
between market]{.underline} **[dynamics]{.underline}** [and **political
dynamics**]{.underline} in stabilizing cyberspace, it can evaluate if
the socio-technical institutions that secure cyberspace reflect the
tools and practices of public and private actors.

Third, the key governance challenge at the domestic political level is
how to overcome fragmentation of authority and accountability. Tighter
coupling of technical systems and their growing interconnectedness with
socio-political institutions creates growing demand for governance in
networks, which in turn means that governments increasingly share
responsibility with actors from business and society. The integration of
policy into a coherent overall framework involves difficult trade-offs
between security and privacy and creates horizontal and vertical
coordination and cooperation problems across government and at the
intersections between state, economy, and society. Research can evaluate
how states can fine-tune their multidimensional roles. How states decide
to regulate their technology base is moreover directly linked to how
they anticipate this will influence their relative economic, political,
and military power at the international level. Academics in this context
can study how different (democratic and authoritarian) political systems
balance regulation and market forces differently and what this means for
state access to the private technology sector, export control systems of
dual-use technologies, and screening mechanisms of foreign investment
into the strategically relevant technology base.

Scientific practice, as our third and final sphere of interest, will
keep coevolving with the anticipated changes in the spheres of
technology and politics. We started the article with the ascertainment
that there is no "field" or "subfield" of cyber security politics--and
we conclude with a wish that this remains true in the future. [Research
at the **intersection**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
**[cybersecurity]{.underline}** [and **security politics** in order to
remain **relevant**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[policy
choices]{.underline}** [and cognizant of technological possibilities
needs to **speak to** a variety]{.underline} of **[other bodies of
research]{.underline}**, [free to choose interesting and pressing issue
without **disciplinary constraints**; it needs to co-opt some of the
**new data** analytical tools]{.underline} **[offered by
AI]{.underline}**, [and it needs to flexibly overcome some of the
**institutional barriers**]{.underline} [that slowed down its
**independent contribution** to **cyber security**]{.underline}.

A first key challenge for cyber security politics research is conceptual
and linked to the integration of theoretical knowledge from different
disciplines and research traditions. Researchers need to better
integrate concepts and mechanisms from IR and security studies, IPE, and
intelligence studies to analyze the transformation of intelligence
services and how this affects their relationship with private cyber
security and intelligence firms. They need to better understand the
interplay between (black) security markets and (covert) security
political dynamics if they want to explain the co-existence of strategic
restraint and low-level subversion in cyberspace. Cyber security
politics research must pay more attention to economic aspects of the
phenomena at hand. Practice theory with its focus on technological
possibilities and socio-technical processes allows to integrate these
different approaches at the empirical level. STS offers a productive
lens for understanding the mutual interplay between the technical and
the socio-political sphere and, from an analytical point of view, to
deal with the opaqueness of cyber operations. Such an approach is of
critical importance in an attempt to shed light on how the cyber
security policy and practice of states, both at the national and the
international level, are facilitated or thwarted by the interests and
practices of actors that are not easily visible, in- and outside of
governments.

A second key challenge or indeed an opportunity for cyber security
politics research is linked to the fact that more data about cyber
operations by many different actors around the world and better tools to
monitor and analyze this data are becoming available. While there is
room for theory development and theory testing, we will likely enter an
era of empirical work. In-depth qualitative studies on the role of
invisible actors in state interactions linked to cyber security can be
combined with more data-driven approaches that evaluate how new AI tools
affect the cyber offense-defense balance. As state actors begin to
integrate these tools in their border guards, police corps, armies and
disaster response structures, important social and political questions
will arise linked to privacy, bias, and control. Conversely, governments
and societies will need to discuss how much of this new data should be
made publicly available and what this means for data protection and
privacy. From a research point of view, these developments call for more
interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer science,
mathematics, economics, and political science.

A third key challenge for cyber security politics research is linked to
overcoming the institutional barriers that slow down its independent
contribution to cyber security and cyber security politics. Universities
can help the public actors at the national and international level to
catch up in their technology competence, while educating the next
generation of experts for society and industry.
**[Academia]{.underline}** [can contribute to the study of **cyber
conflict** and through its **independent**]{.underline} [and
peer-reviewed **knowledge**]{.underline} [broaden the knowledge base for
some of the **difficult**]{.underline} [policy choices discussed
above]{.underline}. [Science can collaborate with the **private** and
**public actors**]{.underline} [in the development of **evidentiary
standards**]{.underline} and [norms that will underpin the **future
resilience**]{.underline} [of sociotechnical systems]{.underline}, and
[in the negotiation and establishment of new norms and institutions that
should govern the use and misuse of these systems. Yet in order to free
its full **potential**]{.underline}, [universities must overcome the
**institutional barriers** that]{.underline} slow down
**[interdisciplinary]{.underline}** [and more so **transdisciplinary
research**]{.underline} [intersection of science,
technology]{.underline}, while [building a network of institutions and
programs that together can considerably expand the body of **public
knowledge**]{.underline} surrounding these societally and politically
relevant questions.

Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Florian J. Egloff, "Hyper-Securitization,
Everyday Security Practice and Technification: Cyber-Security Logics in
Switzerland," Swiss Political Science Review, vol. 21, no. 1, 2021,
<https://doi.org/10.1111/spsr.12433>

On the other hand, [Everyday Security Practices are invoked frequently
in the Swiss cyber-security discourse.]{.underline} Particularly, [the
idea of individuals as 'responsible' partners is reinforced in the
various cyber-security policy documents and debates]{.underline}. [This
is partially manifest in the credo that everyone is primarily
responsible for their own cyber-security.]{.underline} Such thinking
echoes with the strong political ideal of subsidiarity that demands the
leanest role of the state possible. Th[e responsibility of individuals
in the security of the whole collective is highlighted through calls
towards more awareness and prevention campaigns,]{.underline} informing
the broader public about cyber risks and countermeasures, thereby aiming
to improve prevention and resiliency, security concepts of the
everyday.6 Through the aim of resiliency, [the individual is
discursively constructed as being directly attached to larger security
outcomes of social collectives.]{.underline}

Of all three, [Technification is the most intriguing logic.]{.underline}
[Cyber-security 'experts' with a mostly technical background
drive]{.underline} the Swiss [discourse]{.underline} -- be they ICT
entrepreneurs, specialists, or researchers. [This reflects the
technification of the securitised cyber-security discourse, in that
privilege is given to constructing cyber-security as a primarily
technical issue]{.underline}. Other, [non-technical commentators often
preface their statements]{.underline} with "I am no technical expert,
but\..." [demonstrating the need to legitimise one's own
contributions]{.underline} to a political discourse, when one is not
considered 'technical' This [technified discourse is further visible
throughout policy solutions]{.underline}, be they the way critical
infrastructure risk is measured (i.e. calculated in complex formulas and
statistics), or the state of internet security in Switzerland is
communicated (e.g. how many percent of Swiss websites implement a
particular security technology).

Conclusion

In this contribution, we demonstrated that Swiss [cyber-security
politics can be fruitfully approached with constructivist
research,]{.underline} more specifically, [one that draws on practice
approaches]{.underline}. Of the three securitization logics as described
by Hansen and Nissenbaum, all three are present in the Swiss case, with
technification being the dominant one at present. [For democratic
politics, technification is a particular challenge.]{.underline}
[Assigning an issue to the technical realm has a depoliticizing
influence]{.underline}, [which removes it from democratic
deliberations.]{.underline} By making cyber-security an issue of the
'genius few', [technification makes contestation from those with less
technical expertise very hard if not impossible or makes it easy for
those with the most valued expertise to discredit others without
it.]{.underline} In addition, [the power of technical expertise comes
with a claim of being 'neutral' or 'a-political', and
hence,]{.underline} of being [more valid]{.underline} [than
anything]{.underline} that seems [emotional]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} based on [moral]{.underline}s.

The Swiss case also highlights interesting aspects for securitization
research and beyond. In theory, [securitization assumes that there is
one powerful actor who can make a convincing case for the exceptional
nature of a policy issue]{.underline}. [The entire Swiss political
system works against this]{.underline}. [**There are always multiple
voices and multiple audiences to convince** -- which makes it much
harder to be successful in a simple securitization move based on
urgency]{.underline}. In such a political system, **[less 'visible'
bureaucratic actors need to be studied more thoroughly.]{.underline}**
Security is not mainly the domain of security elites and politicians.
Instead, the [research focus needs to shift to everyday security
practices]{.underline}, to less traditional security actors, and to
actors outside government that have a central role in the creation of
danger knowledge and everyday security.

Beyond securitization research, it is evident that [looking closely at
the **intricacies of political systems, power distribution and political
culture,**]{.underline} as studied by scholars in comparative politics
and similar fields, [becomes necessary to understand security logics in
any policy field]{.underline}. **[Bringing the two research traditions
more closely together]{.underline}** in some form of conversation across
sub-disciplinary boundaries **[could be beneficial for
both.]{.underline}**

**[2AC\-\--Securitization Good]{.underline}**

**Cyber securitization is inevitable AND good -- recognizing the threat
is key to developing necessary protections**

**Hersee 19** -- PhD in Cyber Security, which focusses on the dispute
between digital rights and national security in cyberspace.

Steven Hersee, "THE CYBER SECURITY DILEMMA AND THE SECURITISATION OF
CYBERSPACE," Royal Holloway University of London, 2019,
https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-cyber-security-dilemma-and-the-securitisation-of-cyberspace(dcf65dd5-c75d-40ce-8994-6da979eaa1e7).html

5.2 SHOULD CYBERSPACE BE DESECURITISED?

[**Desecuritisation** is the process by which an issue is removed from
the security sphere and is **no longer considered to be an urgent
threat**]{.underline}, requiring exceptional measures to counter. For
the Copenhagen School, 'it means not to have issues phrased as "threats
against which me have countermeasures" but to move them out of this
threat-defense sequence and into the ordinary public sphere' (Busan, et
al., 1998, p. 29).

But [**desecuritisation is difficult to achieve once an issue has been
accepted as threatening** and **desecuritisation does not guarantee than
an issue will become re- politicised** and re-open to public
debate]{.underline}. [If securitising moves are rejected forcefully
enough, then **issues can become both de-securitised and
de-politicised**]{.underline} (See Figure 5.1). [This means that **not
only are the issues considered non- threatening, but they are also
closed for discussion**]{.underline}. Islamic extremism and immigration
are issues that are often difficult to discuss in a political
environment because they are either securitised as existentially
threatening or de-politicised because the responses to them are
considered threatening, racist or intolerant.

Cyberspace scholars are in general agreement that cyberspace
securitisation has mainly negative consequences. Kingsmith, for example,
discusses the negative consequences that emerge from moves by states to
securitise internet content.

Considering these securitising moves \... the more that filtering
practices are withheld from public scrutiny and accountability, the more
tempting it is for framing authorities to employ these tools for
illegitimate reasons such as the stifling of both opposition and civil
society networks (Kingsmith, 2013, p. 1).

Deibert also highlights the negative consequences of the securitisation
of cyberspace, including the resultant threats to basic freedoms.

[There has been a **growing recognition of serious risks in
cyberspace**]{.underline}. The need to manage these risks has led to a
wave of securitization efforts that have potentially serious
implications for basic freedoms (Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010, p. 49).

Whilst arguing that the securitisation of cyberspace is negative and
inevitable, Deibert also contends that the form of [this
**securitisation can be influenced**. 'The **securitization of
cyberspace may be inevitable**, but what form that security takes is
not']{.underline} (Deibert, 2012, p. 274). He suggests that it is better
to securitise threats to human rights than to securitise threats to
national security. Mariya Georgieva takes this further, citing the
Snowden disclosures as an example of the securitisation of digital
rights, arguing that Snowden had 'successfully shifted the focus of the
securitisation of cyberspace from values such as the survival of the
state and effective national security to the survival of privacy and
personal choice' (Georgieva, 2015, p. 44). Whilst she celebrates this
shift she does not explain why it is better to securitise privacy rather
than national security. Helen [Nissenbaum is one author who does take a
more consequentialist approach to cyberspace securitisation, arguing
that **it might be justified when the threat is as extreme** as its
proponents claim.]{.underline}

[If those who subscribe to a conception of security as cybersecurity are
right, particularly **if the magnitude of threat is as great as those on
the extremes claim, then an extraordinary response is warranted despite
its chilling effects**]{.underline} (Nissenbaum, 2005, p. 73).

However, this approach is rare and most literature is either critical of
state surveillance and the securitisation of cyberspace, or is
complimentary of Edward Snowden and supportive of the securitisation of
individual privacy. Given that a narrow majority of the British public
support greater efforts to protect national security it is surprising
that academic literature is weighted so strongly towards criticisms of
state surveillance and the securitisation of national security (Pew
Research Centre, 2016). Even when cyberspace securitisation by non-state
actors is addressed, such as in Georgieva's work on Snowden as an
alternative securitizing actor, [these forms of securitisation are
**considered positive** because they **support human
rights**.]{.underline} In the US and UK, academics have also been
politically active in opposing state surveillance. In 2014 over one
thousand scholars from a wide range of disciplines formed the 'academics
against surveillance' campaign, which published an open letter
criticising state surveillance (Electronic Frontier Foundation, 2014).

Whilst there is disagreement over whether desecuritisation is always
best and what types of securitisation should be reversed, there are a
variety of means through which desecuritisation can be achieved.

### 1AR\-\--Securitization Good

**Even if cyber securitization is bad, it's inevitable and necessary --
their alt ensures infrastructure attacks and cyber crimes**

**Pickin 12** -- MA in War Studies and University of London

Matthew Pickin, "What is the securitization of cyberspace? Is it a
problem?," University of London, 2012,
https://www.academia.edu/3100313/What_is_the_securitization_of_cyberspace_Is_it_a_problem

In analysing the problems of securitization, major issues have been
raised. Threat inflation, surveillance, militarisation and the
military-industrial complex are only some of the most prominent issues.
[There are **benefits of securitization** however]{.underline}, and at
the very end of this analysis [it]{.underline} will be explained why
**[securitization is necessary for now]{.underline}**. The main
supporting arguments for securitization include, the future of
cyber-attacks in conflicts, protecting critical infrastructure and
cyber-crime.

The 2010 National Intelligence Annual Threat Assessment stated that [the
United States was under a severe threat of cyber-attacks]{.underline}
(Blair, 2010). Due to the amount of infrastructure connected to the
internet in the United States targets for cyber-attacks are nearly
unlimited, as a superpower the United States presents a valuable target.
"As the world's hegemonic power, [the United States is also the **main
target** state that dissident groups, terrorists, and rogue states wish
to damage]{.underline} (Valeriano & Maness, 2011, p. 145)." [Therefore,
the **United States must have some defence, or offensive capability in
order to protect itself from future conflicts and attacks on critical
infrastructure**]{.underline}. In Foreign Affairs William J Lynn the
former deputy secretary of defence wrote that the centrality of
information technology in the United States makes it a prime target. He
argued that extending advanced cyber-defences was crucial for the
American economy, and also stated that [**failure of critical
infrastructure** would **compromise national defence**]{.underline},
"Our assessment is that [**cyber-attacks** will be a **significant
component** of future conflicts]{.underline} (Lynn, 2011)." Therefore
**[in order to protect the United States, the government has been forced
to securitize the issue]{.underline}**. According to William J Lynn an
attack could compromise national defence; therefore the issue is very
high in the national security agenda. In the article, he also addresses
the critics who argue that cyberspace is at risk of being militarized
and states that US cyber strategy has been designed to prevent this from
happening, "Far from militarizing cyberspace, U.S. cyber-strategy will
make it more difficult for military actors to use cyberspace for hostile
purposes (Lynn, 2011)." [In **securitizing cyberspace** and creating
advanced cyber-defences and cyber-weapons the United States is
**preparing for any future conflict or attack.** If such an attack or
conflict is a real existing threat then it is **beneficial to prepare
through securitization**]{.underline}, otherwise the disadvantages
clearly outweigh any advantage.

[The other **main benefit** of **securitizing cyberspace** would be
**tackling cyber-crime**]{.underline}. According to the security company
Sophos, in the first six months of 2010 it received 60,000 new malware
samples every day. Apart from malware, cyber-crime covers many different
areas such as financial, piracy, hacking and cyber-terrorism. [These
crimes are growing due to the constantly evolving communications system
of social sharing of data]{.underline}, online data storage and social
networking, "Although cybercrime has formed a hidden shadow and a kind
of evil doppelganger to every step of the Internet's long history from
its very origins, its growth has suddenly become explosive in recent
years by virtually any estimate (Deibert & Rohozinski, Contesting
Cyberspace and the Coming Crisis of Authority, 2012, p. 28)." Both
Deibert and Rohozinski argue that the rise is cyber-crime has become a
big problem for states, in 2011 counterfeiting and copying cost the
Asia-Pacific region almost \$21 billion. Certainly cyber-space has
become a rewarding way to commit crimes with little risk of prosecution,
"Cybercrime has elicited so little prosecution from the world's law
enforcement agencies it makes one wonder a de facto decriminalization
has occurred (Deibert & Rohozinski, Contesting Cyberspace and the Coming
Crisis of Authority, 2012, p. 29)." [Due to the trouble of cyber-crime,
**the only way of combating it effectively would be greater state
regulation and intervention**]{.underline}. With the whole of
cyber-space effectively securitized by the United States due to the
threat to national security by technological and social shifts, the
government is asserting itself increasingly to counter these threats.

Conclusion

In analysing what was the securitization of cyberspace, the beginnings
of the cyber-debate in the United States have been examined; this
country was used due to reliance on information technology and the
status as a superpower. The securitization model from the Copenhagen
school of thought was used to understand how issues are non-politicized,
politicized and eventually securitized. A different range of security
bills have been examined with this model to understand what was needed
for cyberspace to become a securitized issue. With the definition of
securitization dependent on the terms of national security, the changing
definition of this concept was also examined. Securitization has
occurred due to an evolving history whereby the military have understood
the potential of information technologies in warfare and where
vulnerabilities have been recognised that could damage national
security.

In evaluating whether securitization of cyberspace is a problem, it is
very clear that securitization is a growing concern with many
complications. There are many issues including privacy, regulation,
surveillance, internet regulation and the growing tension in the
international system. However, [because the United States is a
superpower contesting with other cyber-heavyweights such as Iran, Russia
and China **the issue will not be de-securitized in the short
term**]{.underline}. With the discovery and use of cyber-weapons, [many
states are in the process of making their own for defensive and
offensive purposes. The government of the **United States will not
de-securitize the issue of cyberspace while there are rival states and
groups which prove a threat to the national security
agenda**]{.underline}. These problems will continue to exist until there
is no defensive agenda and the issue is de-securitized, [for now
**securitization is a necessary evil**.]{.underline}

Cluster 1: [The **reality of cyber conflict**]{.underline}: Explaining
state restraint and practices

[In the **beginning** of this **intellectual history**, political
aspects of **cyber security**]{.underline} [were discussed almost
**exclusively** in publications]{.underline} originating in U.S.
**[think tanks]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[war
colleges]{.underline}** (for example: Arquilla & Ronfeldt, 1992). [This
literature had **little ambition**]{.underline} to contribute to an
academic debate. The two main questions it tackled were "who (or what)
is the biggest danger for an increasingly networked
nation/society/military/business environment" and "how to best counter
the new and evolving threat."

[The]{.underline} first [cluster is characterized by a
**reevaluation**]{.underline} [of the threat based on **empirical
evidence**]{.underline} [and a **gradual application**]{.underline} [and
adaption of "**old**]{.underline}" **[IR]{.underline}** [and strategic
studies]{.underline} [concepts to **cyber security**]{.underline}
(Kello, 2013). [Two cyber incidents]{.underline}--[the discovery of
**Stuxnet**]{.underline} [in 2010 and later the **Snowden
disclosures**]{.underline} in 2013--[were **instrumental**]{.underline}
in [shifting the focus of both **policymakers**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[researchers]{.underline}** [from the **threat
politics** of "**what if**]{.underline}"-[scenarios that had dominated
the 1990s and early 2000s]{.underline} [to the **reality** of the
**strategic use**]{.underline} [of **cyberspace**]{.underline} [by state
actors.]{.underline} In this new context, [literature in **IR**
and]{.underline} **[strategic studies]{.underline}** [could be used to
examine how **state actors**]{.underline} [use cyber instruments for
their **political** or **military advantage**]{.underline} and analyze
their impact on national and international security (Borghard &
Lonergan, 2017; Kello, 2017; Maness & Valeriano, 2016). [A strong
disciplinary]{.underline} "**[pull]{.underline}**" is [visible in how
early works **zoomed**]{.underline} in [on an alleged **offensive
advantage**]{.underline} in [cyberspace due to the ubiquity of technical
vulnerabilities (Peterson, 2013), grappled with the problem of
**escalation dynamics** in cyberspace]{.underline} (Liff, 2012), and
asked how deterrence might be adapted in order to uphold stability in
cyberspace (Wilner, 2019).

As researchers began to build data sets of cyber operations (Kostyuk &
Zhukov, 2019; Valeriano & Maness, 2014) to link cyber issues to the
larger agenda of conflict studies, [an empirical puzzle emerged that
**challenged** many of the **theoretical tenets**]{.underline} [and
standards assumptions of the **older literature**]{.underline}. Most
cyber operations did not seem escalatory, nor were they determined by
power asymmetries or changed the existing strategic balance.
**[Overall]{.underline}**, [states seemed to exercise a fair
amount]{.underline} of **[restraint]{.underline}** in cyberspace
(Gartzke, 2013; Gartzke & Lindsay, 2015; Valeriano & Maness, 2015).
**[At the same time, however]{.underline}**, [a lot of cyber operations
linked to **state rivalries occurred**]{.underline}, though as mere
add-ons to existing conflict dynamics and not independent of a broad
range of other foreign policy instruments (Betz & Stevens, 2011).

Reacting to this puzzle, the literature in this cluster has begun to
move in two directions: First, and comparable to the evolution of the
strategic studies literature during the nuclear age, some
[authors]{.underline} have started to integrate additional non-systemic
explanatory factors into their analyses of cyber conflict. While some
[explore the role of beliefs]{.underline} [and **cognitive
biases**]{.underline} in cyber policy decision making (Gomez, 2019),
[others]{.underline} zoom in on the destabilizing role of bureaucratic
politics and other deficiency of the policy process especially in crisis
decision making. Second, and more consequentially, many authors
acknowledge that the emerging empirical picture reflects the structural
feature of cyberspace as an operating environment, which is marked by a
high degree of technical interconnectedness and constant political
contestation (Fischerkeller & Harknett, 2018; Smeets, 2018). Taking this
into account, operating strategically in cyberspace seems to be more
technically and organizationally demanding than the "cheap and
easy"-metaphor suggests, while at the same time offering little enduring
strategic gains in the sense of changing a rival's political goals
(Lewis, 2018; Slayton, 2017).

**[2AC\-\--Realism Good]{.underline}**

**A focus on the state is still necessary and appropriate. Critical
approaches fail because they focus on [theory]{.underline} and
[abstraction]{.underline} over empirical data.**

In 2006, [Eriksson and Giacomello stated]{.underline} that the
discipline of international relations (**[IR]{.underline}**) [was
struggling to **apply**]{.underline} [its]{.underline} varied
theoretical [toolbox]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the topic of **[cyber
security]{.underline}**, therein [detecting]{.underline} "great
[difficulties for theoretical adaptation]{.underline} and application in
analyses of the complexities of the emerging new digital world" (p.
236). **[This observation no longer holds true]{.underline}**. [Due
to]{.underline} interlinked [changes occurring in the
**fields**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[technology]{.underline}**,
[politics, and **science**]{.underline}, [research that applies
**international relations**]{.underline} [or **security**]{.underline}
studies [theory to different facets of the]{.underline}
**[phenomenon]{.underline}** [is no longer as **rare**]{.underline},
inviting us to look at this emergent body of research in depth at this
point in time (for a similar undertaking see Deibert, 2017a, 2017b).

This special issue displays the latest wave of cyber security politics
research. The articles position themselves mostly in a post-positivist
research tradition and use a set of different theories and conceptual
frameworks to analyze the current state of cyber security in politics.
Some articles examine the contested nature of public attributions of
cyber incidents, the norm-setting day-to-day behavior of intelligence
agencies, and discuss the consequences for governments and governance.
Another group of articles explores the knowledgeshaping practices of
IT-security companies, the co-production of risks and vulnerabilities by
technology and experts, and aim at better understanding the role of
firms and experts in strategic state interactions.

In this introductory article, we provide the intellectual history to
situate the literature in its broader evolutionary context. In a first
part, inspired by Buzan and Hansen's framework from their "The Evolution
of International Security Studies" (2009), we discuss six drivers that
have been influential in the evolution of (Western) cyber security
politics and how it is studied. In a second part, we identify three
clusters of research. In each of them, we highlight the interplay
between technological possibilities and political choices of state
actors in combination with scientific factors. [The focus on "**the
state**]{.underline}" [is]{.underline} **[appropriate and
necessary]{.underline}**, [because **security** politics is **inevitably
tied** to questions of **authority and power**]{.underline}. That said,
[the state is not the **only**]{.underline} [important actor in this
space]{.underline}--rather, [it is at the **intersection**]{.underline}
[between state and nonstate actors, nationally and
internationally]{.underline}, [that the **specificities**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[cyber security]{.underline}** [politics
emerge]{.underline}.

In the conclusion, we use these same drivers to look into the possible
future of cyber security politics research. We claim that it should not
be conceptualized as a sub-field of anything, so that inquiry is not
overly restricted by the disciplining power of disciplines. Cyber
security transcends levels of analysis, necessitates considerable
interdisciplinary knowledge, and will be shaped by the availability of
new data and methods. Its relevance for society is likely to become even
bigger in the future, with new digital technologies expanding the
spatial boundaries of cyberspace and with new complex issues emerging.
Scientific knowledge of both the problem-solving and the reflexive kind
is crucial to understand what politics these technologies will have and
how they will be linked to broader socio-economic changes affecting the
society, the economy, and the state in the future.

Factors driving the evolution of cyber security politics research

Mapping a body of research is no trivial and certainly no purely
objective undertaking. In order to simplify and abstract, a series of
choices have to be made about what to include and what to exclude. As
critical cartographers know, "\[m\]apping is epistemological but also
deeply ontological -- it is both a way of thinking about the world,
offering a framework for knowledge, and a set of assertions about the
world itself" (Kitchin, Perkins, & Dodge, 2009, p. 1). First, we hone in
on "cyber security politics," highlighting two areas that help to
structure the debate. What we aim for in these pages is an understanding
of cyber security politics that is flexible enough to deal with the
dynamics of the phenomenon, yet precise enough to demarcate the research
focus sufficiently to be of use. Second, and loosely following Buzan and
Hansen (2009), we identify six driving forces that explain the dynamic
co-evolution of cyber security politics and the academic engagement with
it. These factors help us to understand what researchers choose to write
about, what subjects and issues they define as the main cyber security
problem(s) and which ontologies, epistemologies, and methods carry
legitimacy (Buzan & Hansen, 2009, pp. 39--40).

Staking out cyber security politics

What is "cyber security" and how is it related to security politics? Far
from allowing a straightforward answer, this question lies at the heart
of the political and academic debates about the issue. First, cyber
security is a relatively new term for a set of older practices around
the security of computer networks (Von Solms & Van Niekerk, 2013).
Second, definitions for the term are contested, exemplified by the
refusal of some state actors to agree on a common vocabulary (Giles &
Hagestad, 2013). Third, the meaning of the term is changing across time.
Not so long ago, a limited circle of experts discussed cyber security
primarily as a technical risk management issue in critical information
infrastructure protection. Now the highest government circles deal with
cyber security as a key challenge of national security (Dewar, 2018).
Fourth, parallel to the advancing digitalization of ever more aspects of
the economy, society, and politics, cyber security concerns are
expanding to additional policy domains (Dunn Cavelty & Egloff, 2019). In
sum, cyber security is at the same time moving upwards in the political
agenda and expanding sideways as a problem area to a multitude of
additional policy domains.

Simple and static definitions are not well suited to deal with
constantly changing contexts. However, if we look down on the conceptual
space from a sufficient height, we notice that cyber security politics'
common ground is characterized by two main factors: First, by digital
technologies, specifically their use and misuse by human actors in
economic, social, and political contexts; and second, by enduring and
often highly conflictual negotiation processes in formal and informal
settings between the state and its bureaucracies, society, and the
private sector, geared towards defining roles, responsibilities, legal
boundaries and acceptable rules of behavior.1

The first dimension is tied to the use of a set of distinct digital
technologies and how these technologies are linked to broader
conceptions of socio-economic changes (Papp, Alberts, & Tuyahov, 1997).
The marriage of computers and telecommunications, the integration of
these technologies into a global multimedia system, and their worldwide
inexpensive availability is the bedrock for heralding multiple, rapid
and consequential transformations in production, management, societal
interaction, and governance (Schwab, 2018) though it remains to be seen
just how revolutionary these changes will really be. The most pertinent
questions in cyber security politics with regard to digital technologies
are what their characteristics are, what actions they make possible and
which ones they restrain, but also who develops them in what ways and
why and who has the power to shape their use and misuse.

The second dimension is tied to the role of states and their engagement
with other actors nationally and internationally. "Security" in cyber
security politics can be read in two ways: As cyber security politics
(the security political aspects of the issue) or as cyber security
politics (the politics engaging with questions of cyber security more
broadly). This ambiguity is deliberate because we consider the question
of what type of politics emerges under what kind of rules and with what
kind of boundaries to be crucial. From a theoretical point of view, the
question of how much politics there is or should be in security--and how
much security in politics--allows us to link research in cyber security
to debates in security studies (Hagmann, Hegemann, & Neal, 2019).
Importantly, the state has different roles in cyber security, ranging
from security guarantor, legislator and regulator, to threat actor and
danger to society and other states (Dunn Cavelty & Egloff, 2019). Hence,
cyber security politics are defined by national and international
negotiation processes about the boundaries of the responsibilities of
state, economic, and societal actors and the agreement or disagreement
over the means these actors use. This second dimension includes the
projection of power by certain actors, like the control over populations
and information flows, and the push-back against it as well.

Six driving factors

In their intellectual history of international security studies, Buzan
and Hansen develop a framework of five interrelated factors (2009, pp.
39-- 100)--great power politics, technology, key events, academic
debates, and institutionalization--that drove the evolution of the
field. For cyber security politics, we propose a slightly different
framework, purporting that changes in research are linked to changes in
the empirical phenomenon, whereby these changes can go both ways: A
research phenomenon often influences directions of research, but
research also illuminates aspects of the phenomenon that have gone
unnoticed before. We focus on the interrelationship between technology
and the world of policy and state practice--on what political actors say
they are doing and on what they are doing in the field of cyber security
as a political issue, both nationally and internationally, often in
relation to other actors--and on the different ways to observe this
interrelationship (Figure 1). The intellectual history of cyber security
politics is thus shaped by the interplay of three broad spheres:
Technology, Politics, and Science.2 Technological dynamics interact with
social and political dynamics. Technological possibilities and
constraints influence socio-economic processes. In turn, political
preferences and contexts shape the evolution of digital technologies.
This also applies fundamentally to the actors developing these
technologies and to the dynamic interplay of cyber security markets and
cyber security politics. Within each of the three spheres, we identify
two main drivers. In different combinations during different times,
these six factors stimulate or dissuade scholars from picking up
specific research questions. A summary can be seen in Table 1, with a
more detailed description in what follows.

\[\[Figure Omitted\]\]

Technology as a driver

It seems like an obvious choice to include "technology" as a category,
since the issue of cyber security is linked to the development and use
of cyberspace, a technological environment entirely built by humans. Yet
scholars have rightly pointed out that the vision of one unique
cyberspace is itself based on a social construction (Bingham, 1996;
Graham, 1998). Indeed, the conception of what cyberspace is and what can
be done with it has changed considerably throughout its history,
highlighting the needfor historically contingent understandings of the
development and use of technologies. However, a core characteristic of
IR scholarship's dealing with digital technology is "technological
determinism" (Herrera, 2003). The majority of IR approaches chooses to
deal with technology as an exogenous variable (McCarthy, 2018, p. 4),
seeing technologies as a material objects or power resources that drive
social change or as neutral tools that acquire meaning only through
their use (Leese & Hoijtink, 2019).

In contrast, we understand technologies as embodiments of societal
knowledge in the tradition of science and technology studies (STS), as
sites where power relations can be seen in operation and where the
shaping and coordination of the behavior of social and political actors
happens (Behrent, 2013, p. 57). During the design stage of technologies,
the intentions, norms, and values of their developers find their way
into the artefacts, while existing power structures influence the
desirability of specific aspects or forms of technology. Once
technologies diffuse, they are often given particular meanings and
acquire purposes other than the one initially intended by their
developers (Matthewman, 2011), but always within certain inescapable
material bounds (see also Fischerkeller & Harknett, 2018). For example:
A pen can be used for writing, but it can also be used to stab someone.
It can, however, not be used to make phone calls.

\[\[Table Omitted\]\]

That digital technologies "have politics" is hardly a contested
statement (Deibert, 2003, 2013; DeNardis, 2014; Mueller, 2010; Price,
2018). Design decisions made by engineers in the late 1960s have
implications until today, especially for security. From the early
prototype phase as ARPANET (1967- 1972) to the gradual development into
"the Internet" (1973-1983), technological protocols that define how data
is exchanged were written in an egalitarian spirit (Naughton, 2016). The
decision to have a system with minimal rules that had no central power
and no censor was deliberate and based on philosophical and political
beliefs of the technical community (Berners-Lee, 1999). Cyber security
as we understand it today became an issue only gradually, when the
system architecture changed from large proprietary machines with little
connection to "smaller and far more open systems (not built with
security in mind) coupled with the rise of networking" (Libicki, 2000),
yet still ran on the same basic protocols.

The perception that cyberspace is creating and perpetuating insecurity
with potentially catastrophic consequences is shaped by different key
events linked to the technological sphere as a second important driving
factor. In line with what we noted above, these events are not
understood as causal forces that unidirectionally influence politics or
science (cf. Buzan & Hansen, 2009, p. 54ff.) but rather as interrelated
catalyzers. The category consists of events outside the cyber realm with
influence on cyber security politics (examples include 9/11, the Snowden
revelations, or the Arab Spring), and cyber incidents themselves. In its
most basic form, a cyber incident is a disruption that challenges the
normal operation of digital technologies. Undesired change inside
machines create technical effects. Yet these technical effects alone are
not sufficient to explain the salience of cyber security in politics.
Between the initial effect in the machine and the political effect lies
a knowledge production process that creates an incident embedded in a
specific social context. A technical effect needs to be discursively
linked to something with sufficient social or political value to become
security politically relevant--which also explains why only some cyber
incidents reach that stage while others do not (Balzacq & Dunn Cavelty,
2016).

Such moments of disruption highlight previously hidden characteristics
of socio-technical artifacts, opening up opportunities for the study of
new aspects of the phenomena that were not easily observable before or
did not seem important (Best & Walters, 2013, p. 346; Latour, 1999).
Incidents are also linked to another fundamental issue in the study of
cyber security: the availability of data. Our current knowledge about
cyber security relies heavily on data from commercial threat reporting
and news reports. Yet this data provides a partial and biased view of
cyber threat activity, because it is often politicized and influenced by
the demands of powerful buyers and the interests of capable providers
(Lindsay, 2017).

Politics as a driver

The discipline of **[IR]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} mainly
[interested in patterns of **cooperation**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[conflict]{.underline}** [among
**states**]{.underline} [and how these patterns relate to shifts in the
distribution]{.underline} and **[character of power]{.underline}** [in
the international system]{.underline}: international power politics.
[As]{.underline} the issue of **[cyber security]{.underline}** [gained
in importance in **state interactions**]{.underline}, [experts and
policy makers pondered whether **digital technologies**]{.underline}
[gave rise to a "**new**"]{.underline} type of **[power]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [how this power source would influence the
**existing** power **distribution**]{.underline} [in the
system]{.underline} (Nye, 2011). Given that IR began as an "American
discipline, was focused on American security and written by Americans"
(Buzan & Hansen, 2009, p. 51), the debate about the security
implications arising from the spread of information technologies also
originated in America, with a series of implications for how the subject
was studied. Though definitions vary, cyber power is understood as the
use of resources related to cyberspace to achieve specific (political)
ends inside and outside of cyberspace (cf. Nye, 2010, p. 3). In the
contemporary U.S. setting, a discourse of simultaneous empowerment and
disempowerment characterized the conceptual debate from the beginning.
While the technological realm carried the promise of wielding a new sort
of power, it highlighted new dependencies and vulnerabilities at the
same time (Rattray, 2001).

Apart from giving the digital domain a particular weight in the broader
questions that IR scholars are interested in, [we]{.underline} also
[need to consider]{.underline} [how]{.underline} **[international
politics]{.underline}** [influence the **use** of **these
technologies**]{.underline}. [Given the **interconnection**
between]{.underline} **[technology]{.underline}** [and politics, we can
expect the **overall state** of **world politics**]{.underline} to [have
a noticeable influence on the forms of **use**/misuse of]{.underline}
**[these technologies]{.underline}**. [Buzan and Hansen call this larger
context "**patterns of enmity** and amity between **great
powers**]{.underline}" (2009, p. 52). [This highlights questions of
cooperation and conflict]{.underline}, about the formation of alliances
and the maintenance of strategic stability, about the proliferation and
control of dual-use technologies, but also about the efforts of states
to come to international agreements in the form of norms and
institutions.

[In our conception of politics, the **international
dimension**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} just **[one
aspect]{.underline}** [of a broader set of political
interactions]{.underline}. [Cyber security is **not only**]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} **[enmity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[amity]{.underline}** [and the potential for]{.underline}
**[war]{.underline}** and peace. In fact, [it is not very often about
situations of great urgency]{.underline}, [but more often]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} "**[normal" domestic politics]{.underline}**. Like
many other complex policy issues, **[cyber security]{.underline}** is
[cutting across different areas of **responsibility**]{.underline},
[requiring coordination and cooperation between a wide **variety** of
**public actors**]{.underline} at different levels of government, but
also actors from business and society When government tasks and
authority are delegated downwards (localization), upwards
(supranationalization), or sideways (privatization) (Krahmann, 2003),
governance in networks becomes important. Under such conditions,
governments no longer simply issue instructions and monitor their
implementation, but seek to shape the framework conditions so that
cooperation operates as smoothly as possible even without constant
oversight (Peters & Pierre, 1998; Salamon, 2002), coming with a set of
challenges for state-society relationships.

Science as a driver

The last two factors are situated in the realm of science that is
understood here as a collective term for "academic work," "intellectual
labor," or "knowledge production." Like Buzan and Hansen (2009, pp.
57-65), we focus on academic debates and on institutionalization. This
introduces an element of internal conflict into our intellectual
history, because even if academics would agree on the key events or
issues that need to be studied, how they would study it would still
differ widely. As a case in point, cyber security politics research is
no subfield of anything--it is characterized and united by the
engagement with a multifaceted and dynamic phenomena, but the
disciplinary approaches used, the ontological and epistemological
choices, vary greatly.

Debates about ontology, epistemology, and methodology are at the heart
of some of the most fruitful key debates in security studies, but at the
same time they divide the discipline. [The biggest
**cleft**]{.underline} [exists between **problem-solving** theories and
**critical theories**]{.underline}: the former do not explicitly
question the prevailing social and power relationships, while the latter
problematize these very relationships by analyzing their origins and
their evolution (Cox, 1986). [Which of these two approaches is
**favored**]{.underline} [in certain research settings however
**depends**]{.underline} [on many different factors]{.underline}
(Bourbeau, Balzacq, & Dunn Cavelty, 2015). Building on decades of IR
scholarship, **[traditional approaches]{.underline}** [have seen
**incremental**]{.underline} **[theoretical innovation]{.underline}**
[since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. By [contrast, **critical
approaches**]{.underline} [have gone through a phase of rich
**theory**]{.underline} development [and are only
**slowly**]{.underline} [becoming ripe for **empirical
work**]{.underline} based on critical methods (Aradau, Huysmans, Neal, &
Voelkner, 2014). The key focus of interest has been the analysis of the
(social) power relations that underpin security policies in liberal
states, highlighting security as a powerful political technology for
social (and political) control (Dillon & Reid, 2009); as a collection of
discourses that serve to empower and reproduce hierarchies (Shepherd,
2008); or as routinized and patterned practices carried out by
bureaucrats and security professionals (Bigo, 2002). These overall
research trends have an important impact on cyber security politics
research, since the topic has been picked up by all approaches, leading
to distinct takes on what cyber security politics is and how it should
be studied.

**[Automation]{.underline}** [doesn't change the fact that

**[Foreign policy]{.underline}**, like all politics, [is a factor of
**human condition**, including sense, gut feeling and cultural cues,

[Diplomacy]{.underline} too, can [retain its **relevance**]{.underline}

Although all **[states]{.underline}** [will come up with their **own

which automation and foreign policy is headed is more or less similar
for all countries. In the future, diplomacy has to build data processing
and management capabilities, with dedicated departments and scientists
supporting diplomats and negotiators on the ground. The structure of
this new framework will also heavily depend on regime type, scope of
foreign interests and alliance behavior.

[The structural shadow of **uncertainty**]{.underline} over diplomacy is
[stronger than ever]{.underline}. [Some]{.underline} communicative
