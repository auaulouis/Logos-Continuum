Sharing secrets

To outsiders (counter)intelligence -- the (often covert) collection,
analysis, sharing and operationalization of sensitive information of
military or political value -- is shrouded in mystery.7 Non-intelligence
personnel always find it hard to fathom why joint operations, return on
investment and comprehensive approach leave their intelligence
colleagues with eyes glazed over. They are ignorant of intelligence's
obscure characteristics such as trust, risk mitigation, national
interest, deception and quid pro quo. For instance, intelligence is a
trade-off between trusting a partner enough to share information that
could endanger one's own source, against the benefits of doing so. In
the protection of national interest allies are deceived and intelligence
cooperation is carefully weighed even with partners (quid pro quo,
meaning 'tit for tat'). This section of the paper outlines why reluctant
attitudes to multilateral exchange will remain pivotal in intelligence.

Intelligence is, as a rule, executed by national (civilian, military and
hybrid) intelligence and security services that use a combination of
intelligence sources to answer Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs)
of national operational commanders and other decision-making
authorities. In the collection process, open sources set the information
stage, whereas secret intelligence tends to explain the behavior of the
main actors.8 [States]{.underline} and their national services [are
reluctant to share sensitive]{.underline}, [classified
info]{.underline}rmation [with international organizations
and]{.underline} [favor]{.underline} **[cooperation on a more
controllable, bilateral, case-by-case basis]{.underline}**.9 In fact,
intelligence is shared only when [there is]{.underline} a [common threat
perception]{.underline}, mutual trust, a demonstrable added value, the
right type of diplomatic relationships [or]{.underline} a [combination
of incentives]{.underline}.10 The most successful bilateral secret
intelligence collaboration is the AngloAmerican UKUSA Agreement,
originally signed in 1946, which evolved into the exclusive multilateral
so-called 'Five Eyes' cooperation.11

[Examples of beneficial intelligence coop]{.underline}eration [by states
within]{.underline} international organizations, such as [NATO,
are]{.underline} much [harder to find.]{.underline} Friedrich Korkisch
noted that during the last decades of the twentieth century,
intelligence within the Alliance was "the result of the early years of
NATO, when it was assumed that all NATO forces would remain under
national command, and strategic intelligence would be mainly national
intelligence."12 [From the outset Member States **shared secret
info**]{.underline}rmation **[bilaterally]{.underline}** on political
and military issues with NATO; however, major countries within the
Alliance, afraid of the non-secure Brussels apparatus, kept intelligence
from other Members.13 Chris Clough warned that, "within recent military
coalitions, intelligencecontributing nations have been mindful of the
dangers of compromise by less security-conscious partners, while knowing
that a degree of sharing is essential."14 Some argue that international
institutions like NATO play a major role in encouraging and facilitating
intelligence sharing among their member states.15 Although, "even in the
UN intelligence is no longer a dirty word,"16 others remain of the
opinion that nations are unable to overcome mistrust, making them
reluctant to engage in multilateral intelligence cooperation.

The focus of the [intelligence world changed]{.underline} [profoundly
following 9/11]{.underline} with the emergence of counterterrorism (CT)
and non-state actors as dominating global themes.18 Nations witnessed
the introduction of collection coordinating mechanisms, such as the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in the United
States,19 and target-oriented intelligence fusion centers, such as the
Joint Terrorism Analysis Center (JTAC) in the UK.20 [Due to the
perceived common threat]{.underline}, [bilateral exchange of
intel]{.underline}ligence [intensified]{.underline} [and alignments were
formed even]{.underline} **[with non-traditional
partners]{.underline}**. Although this new collaboration with states in
Africa and the Near, Middle and Far East resulted in challenges in the
realms of oversight and human rights, access to raw data and insights on
CT was deemed too relevant not to engage -- 'gains' outweighed
'risks'.21 Following the terrorist attacks on major European cities,
cooperation between the security services deepened and nations realized
that solidarity as well as sharing intelligence on CT should be the
norm.22

[On a multilateral level, **NATO**]{.underline},
**[lacking]{.underline}** its **[own sources by design,]{.underline}**
[responded by introducing intelligence liaison]{.underline} and fusion
[elements]{.underline} and reaffirmed its commitment to intelligence
sharing.23 [However]{.underline}, **[different languages]{.underline}**,
**[cultures]{.underline}**, **[capabilities]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[infra]{.underline}**structures [proved to be
**structural constraints**]{.underline}.24 Unlike the Alliance, the
leadership of the European Union (EU) claimed a coordinating role in
support of all state-level courses of action on CT through a combination
of its law enforcement agency Europol, judicial cooperation agency
Eurojust and border management agency Frontex.25 The EU, not questioning
state actors as first responders to terrorism and its related criminal
networks, strengthened its intelligence structure and joint multilateral
intelligence collaboration was suggested.26 John Nomikos noted that
"while Belgium, \[The Netherlands\] and Austria demanded a CIA-style EU
agency, [powerful member states]{.underline} including Britain, Germany,
France, Spain and Italy [showed a reluctance to share
intelligence]{.underline}."27 Following the Paris 2015 attacks,
[German]{.underline} Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière shattered
Belgian, Dutch and Austrian dreams; "We should not focus our efforts on
creating a new European intelligence service now. I [cannot
imagine]{.underline} we [will be willing to **give up our national
sovereignty."2**]{.underline}

It is important to play defense---including protecting U.S. and allied
cyber networks, exposing Russian bots and trolls, and preparing for
cyberattacks and disinformation. But [[Russia will **continue to
target** the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates at]{.underline}
[home and abroad [until the]{.mark} [U.S.]{.mark} government
**[implements]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[a]{.mark} **more aggressive
[offensive info]{.mark}rmation [campaign]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
goal should be [to **coerce Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **curb**
its]{.mark} **information warfare [campaign]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[punish Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}** [when these incidents
occur]{.underline}, [[and **exploit** Moscow's
**weaknesses**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline}. An [offensive]{.underline} [U.S.
campaign]{.underline} [might include several steps]{.underline}. The
[first]{.underline} [involves]{.underline} **[blunt and
regular]{.underline}** [U.S. warnings to Russian leaders]{.underline},
both in public and private, [that their info]{.underline}rmation warfare
[campaign will be met]{.underline} [with]{.underline} an equally
[forceful response]{.underline}. Senior U.S. officials like President
Donald [Trump have not seriously threatened]{.underline} Moscow despite
substantial evidence of Russian activism in the 2016 U.S. elections;
Russian efforts to exploit issues like gun control, Black Lives Matter,
and the #MeToo movement; and cyberattacks against even conservative U.S.
organizations like the Hudson Institute and the International Republican
Institute. Following the Soviet Union's global active measures campaign
against the United States, U.S. President Ronald Reagan vowed to respond
in kind and, ultimately, to "leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash-heap of
history." Moscow understood that Reagan and his administration were
deadly serious about combating Russian active measures, which is what
Reagan did in authorizing effective overt and covert action programs
against the Soviet Union. Second, [[the]{.mark} United States needs
to]{.underline} [continue developing its offensive cyber capabilities
and]{.underline}---just as important---it needs to **[use them if
necessary]{.underline}**. President [Trump's decision to sign National
Security Presidential Memorandum]{.underline} 13, a directive
facilitating offensive U.S. cyber operations, is a helpful step. This
directive rescinded the Obama administration's more cautious approach
under Presidential Policy Directive 20.46 But this change **[means
little]{.underline}** [if the U.S. **fails to
use**]{.underline}---[or]{.underline}, more importantly, to **[threaten
to use]{.underline}**---**[cyberattacks]{.underline}** [to **protect
itself** from]{.underline} **[cyber operations]{.underline}** [by
countries like Russia]{.underline}. In his influential work "Arms and
Influence," the Nobel Prizewinning economist Thomas Schelling wrote that
"[[it is the threat of damage]{.underline}]{.mark}, [or of more damage
to come]{.underline}, [[that can make someone **yield**]{.mark} or
**comply**]{.underline}." [Moscow needs to understand that [the]{.mark}
United States is **prepared** to **use all available
instruments**]{.underline}---**[including cyber
operations]{.underline}**---[if it continues to be
threatened]{.underline}.

[Key lessons emerge from]{.underline} [assessing]{.underline} progress
in the [Transatlantic cybersecurity]{.underline} experience. Europe's
foundation for cybersecurity cooperation began in recent years. CCDCOE
regularly assists Australia and Japan, and South Korea partners with the
EU's Malware Information Sharing Platform. The EU and NATO took the lead

one that will be [essential for changing]{.underline} the [perception of
the cyber threat ecosystem]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
[solutions]{.underline} [necessary to confront adversaries in

#### Bilateral collaboration solves [better]{.underline} -- NATO cyber resources are [stretched too thin]{.underline}. 

**Pernik, \'21** -- Piret Pernik is a researcher at the NATO Cooperative

Based on the Estonian case study, a policy recommendation for EU and
NATO countries is to apply a three-layered deterrence model.73 First, EU
and NATO countries should participate in entanglement and norms measures
such as cyber diplomacy and capacity-building globally. Second, they
should invest more in denial measures and, third, jointly develop
policies for punitive response options, including developing public
attribution procedures to enable quick attribution, and systematically
implementing sanctions regimes. It would be feasible to establish
memoranda of understanding, and operational- and technical-level
frameworks to radically improve information- and intelligence-sharing.
Participation in cyber defence and crisis management exercises should be
open to like-minded NATO partner countries. [Joint bilateral
cyberspace]{.underline} [operations]{.underline} likewise [contribute to
**mutual trust-building**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[information-sharing]{.underline}**, [and increase

competence]{.underline}.74 [Operational- and technical-level joint
activities should be regularly practised among allies]{.underline} and
with like-minded partners as they contribute to deterrence by denial.
**[Given that NATO's cyber response teams]{.underline}** **[are
stretched thin]{.underline}** [due to protecting NATO's own
networks]{.underline}, **[bi-]{.underline}** and multi**[lateral

[Security Cooperation to Expand Interoperability]{.underline} Is a
Strong Focus of U.S.-Allied Military Relationships

[Allies such as]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom and Australia support and **[encourage
interoperability discussions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [new
investments]{.underline} during senior-level interactions
[with]{.underline} the [Army]{.underline}. For example,
[interoperability discussions]{.underline} have historically
[dominated]{.underline} the [agenda for]{.underline} the
[U.S.-British]{.underline} army-to-army [staff talks]{.underline}. The
[Multinational Fusion Cell]{.underline} in the HQDA [brings together
assigned personnel from]{.underline} multiple [allied
countries]{.underline} (the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Germany,
France, and others) [to focus on interoperability]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} to **[develop U.S.-allied bilateral
interoperability]{.underline}** **[roadmaps]{.underline}**. [Standing
organizations]{.underline}, such as ABCANZ, [also exist to work through
interoperability]{.underline} [issues]{.underline} at the operational
level. Large-scale exercises, such as the aforementioned biannual
Talisman Sabre series between the United States and Australia, are very
much focused on addressing interoperability challenges identified from
recent operations and planning for future operations. NATO defines
interoperability along three dimensions---human, procedural, and
technical---which is a helpful way to categorize interoperability
challenges.34 We find general agreement among our interlocutors that [SC
with highly capable allies to]{.underline} [support human, procedural,
and technical interoperability is advancing at]{.underline} the
[operational]{.underline} [and tactical levels,]{.underline} but there
is concern about a lack of multiyear funding and programming to guide
longer-term planning for multinational interoperability exercises.35

Despite this focus, interoperability initiatives at the strategic level
have been relatively ad hoc from allies' perspectives. The Army's
Interoperability Campaign Plan frames and institutionalizes
interoperability efforts internally and operationalizes it with
designated partners. Allies support the Army's focus on interoperability
writ large, but the links between interoperability planning and ongoing
SC activities needs to be stronger. As an example, the GORT, a bilateral
event between the United States and the United Kingdom at the three- and
four-star level, is not explicitly linked to the discussions that occur
at the one- and two-star levels. According to key allied officials,
issues raised at the GORT level should be automatically addressed at the
subsequent Army staff talks (ASTs) and drive the discussions at the
lower level working groups. Interoperability issues and priorities
raised at the GORTs/staff talks should also be linked to other key
bilateral SC activities, creating a real battle rhythm for
interoperability.

Moreover, allies have suggested that [although **bilateral vision
statements for interoperability**]{.underline}---[such as]{.underline}
the emerging [one with the U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom---
[are positive steps, their]{.underline} [language could be made
stronger]{.underline} and clearer. They suggest dropping the term vision
and making bilateral campaign plans. In addition, aspirational verbs in
Army plans, such as institutionalize, should be replaced by stronger
verbs, such as guarantee.

Both British and Australian officials talk about wanting to be the
United States' partner of choice; the United Kingdom has in place an
explicit strategic communications campaign plan that focuses on improved
access and science and technology collaboration. For the United Kingdom,
this [partnering includes such areas as energy]{.underline};
[antisubmarine warfare; hypersonics;]{.underline} network **[command,
control, and communications]{.underline}**; and nuclear collaboration.
For Australia, areas include intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance; radars; and other high-technology systems. The [emphasis
on being a partner of choice refers to being capable]{.underline},
[likeminded]{.underline}, [and committed]{.underline}. [It is
understandable why key allies desire to have]{.underline} the [strongest
language possible in interoperability]{.underline} planning
[documents]{.underline}.

Implications

We derived the following implications from our findings on expanding
interoperability with the United Kingdom, Australia, and other highly
capable allies:

• [Strengthening]{.underline} the [links between]{.underline} key [SC
activities focused on interoperability]{.underline} at the top level to
lower echelons will help to ensure that the messages are clear and that
appropriate actions are taken at the working group levels. [In this area
**formal mechanisms for linking**]{.underline} the **[deliberations and
decisions]{.underline}** made at GORT meetings with activities at the
army-to-army staff talks would be helpful.

• [Language in interoperability planning documents could]{.underline} be
less aspirational and more definitive. Not only would this [make SC
plans for interoperability more concrete]{.underline} for both the
United States and its allies, but it would also encourage formulation of
measurable goals and metrics for the SC community to enable assessment,
monitoring, and evaluation of progress in enhancing that

The [activities of Russian intelligence services]{.underline}
increasingly pop up in public security debates. In some cases, the known
activities of Russian operatives [involve classical
espionage]{.underline}. In others, their activities hint at much more
robust subversive aims: cultivation of anti-system forces, the purchase
and preparation of infrastructure for future military incursions,
training for paramilitary resistance groups, and the assassination of
perceived enemies. These actions are top-tier covert actions. One may
assume that other actions that provide the basis for this sort of
activity -- such as strategic reconnaissance, cyber penetration and
espionage, excavation of data, the placement agents in positions of
power, and reconnaissance of critical infrastructure -- have progressed
as well. Europe has a mixed record of disrupting these preparations.

[While EU member states on]{.underline} the [eastern flank have
adopted]{.underline} very [robust counter-intelligence]{.underline}
[laws and invested]{.underline} significant [resources in monitoring
Russian operatives]{.underline}, [other **states are** more
**reluctant**]{.underline} to do so. [France has]{.underline} the [legal
framework]{.underline} for such action, [but]{.underline}
[counter-terrorism is]{.underline} its [first priority]{.underline}.
[Germany and Austria]{.underline} -- both countries that were under
Allied supervision and occupation after 1945 -- [have]{.underline}
comparatively [weak laws, and]{.underline} their [decision-makers
maintain]{.underline} a '[hands-off' mentality]{.underline}. In the
past, **[bilateral cooperation]{.underline}** with US services
**[addressed these imbalances]{.underline}**. As a legacy of the
post-war situation, [US and British]{.underline} [services]{.underline}
have the right to [engage in counter-intelligence]{.underline} work [in
Germany]{.underline}. And [Berlin]{.underline}, which has historical
issues with counter-intelligence, has been [happy to
outsource]{.underline} this [politically toxic work]{.underline}. In
doing so, [Washington]{.underline} -- and to a lesser extent London --
[became]{.underline} an **[external balancer]{.underline}** **[in
intra-European affairs]{.underline}**. And while the Trump
administration and its sometimes erratic personnel have significantly
undermined confidence in the US government, the [US intelligence
community]{.underline} has [remained]{.underline} much more

Communicate and Build Consensus

The [State Department]{.underline}'s foreign service
[officers]{.underline} [forward-deployed]{.underline} [as]{.underline}
"**[cyber diplomats]{.underline}**" can **[strengthen
consensus]{.underline}** [among allies]{.underline} and partners [on the
nature of the cyber security problem]{.underline} and on the need for
action to address it. To do so, [they should be conversant]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} the [U.S. gov]{.underline}ernment's [efforts to
address cyber competition and armed]{.underline} [with
info]{.underline}rmation [to speak authoritatively]{.underline} about
them. The [State Department]{.underline} has long [promote]{.underline}d
a [framework for responsible state behavior]{.underline} in cyberspace.
The key [elements of]{.underline} that [framework include]{.underline}:
(1) affirmation that established principles of international law apply
to state behavior in cyberspace;62 (2) **[adherence to
certain]{.underline}** non-binding **[norms]{.underline}** of state
behavior in cyberspace during peacetime; [and]{.underline} (3)
[consideration]{.underline}, [development]{.underline}, [and
implementation of practical
c]{.underline}onfidence-[b]{.underline}uilding [m]{.underline}easures
[to reduce]{.underline} the [risk of conflict in
cyberspace]{.underline}. Since [not all states share American
views]{.underline} on responsible behavior in cyberspace, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is working with]{.underline}
partners and [allies on collective attribution]{.underline} and
imposition of consequences.

These [initiatives]{.underline} are now being [complemented
by]{.underline} the [D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f
[D]{.underline}efense's [strategy of defend forward]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} U.S. [Cyber Command's operational approach
of]{.underline} **[persistent engagement.]{.underline}** The State
Department and United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) officers in missions around the world need to be well-versed in
these other efforts and prepared to explain them to foreign partners on
a routine basis. [America's partners]{.underline} [want to **understand
U.S. government strategy**]{.underline} and policies.[63 It is U.S.
policy that cross-domain responses to]{.underline} [cyber aggression
should be]{.underline} [complemented]{.underline} with [steady and
sustained activities]{.underline} [to]{.underline} make networks more
resilient, to [defend them as far forward as practicable]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} to [contest]{.underline} the most [dangerous
adversaries]{.underline}.64 [Every diplomatic engagement]{.underline}
that includes cyber issues would be an opportunity to [build support for
these mutually reinforcing approaches.]{.underline}

Bolster Cyber Cadre

The greatest talent, most consequential research and development, and
most innovative applications of cyber and other emerging technologies
are globally distributed across individuals, commercial entities,
governments, and academia. Competing successfully requires recognizing,
understanding, and leveraging insights and advances wherever they reside
in real time. The nation that best understands and can most rapidly
harvest the benefits of changing knowledge (e.g., quantum encryption,
artificial intelligence, machine learning, high performance computing,
big data, 5G) will be best positioned to secure its future. Conversely,
states that lag behind competitors will find closing gaps a daunting and
risky challenge. 5G represents the proverbial canary in the coal mine
because the United States lags behind China in deployment. Unless the
United States ensures the talent is in place to monitor and lead on
future technologies, it may again be caught unprepared.

The State Department does designate foreign service officers with a
cyber portfolio, but they are usually assigned as an additional duty,
often to economic officers at embassies and consulates. One option would
be a dedicated cadre of "cyber diplomacy-coned" officers,65 or even a
regional dedicated officer cadre located at a large or strategic embassy
in each region to augment the part-time officers at post. These cyber
diplomacy-coned foreign service officers would report on priorities and
trends in research and investments across governments, industries,
academia, and research institutes worldwide, and identify where
adversary regimes are vulnerable to diplomatic, information, military,
and economic threats.66 They would "identify and catalyze
opportunities," in the words of the U.S. National Security
Strategy,67helping to set the conditions for competition by building
mechanisms for information sharing and agile collaboration.

Enable Defend Forward

The U.S. National Cyber Strategy's guidance to promote a framework of
responsible state behavior in cyberspace, one that ensures there are
consequences for irresponsible behavior, is a key objective for the
United States. To succeed, this framework should be pursued in tandem
with an active approach to stem ongoing adversary cyberspace campaigns
outside of armed conflict. The Department of Defense is now defending
forward, outside its existing networks, to mitigate threats before they
reach the United States. It is time for the State Department to join in
these efforts.

An informal division of labor currently exists between the departments
of State and Defense, whereby the former promotes norms in traditional
diplomatic channels while the latter pursues defend forward through
military channels. Yet this leaves several problems unresolved. Parallel
communication increases the risk of messaging fratricide across military
and diplomatic channels in partner nations. Military cyber operations
may engage foreign policy sensitivities that the State Department is
better equipped to address. On the other hand, State Department desk
officers may throw a wrench into planning because they do not understand
Defense Department strategy.

**NATO 22**, "ABOUT NATO," US Mission to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, <https://nato.usmission.gov/about-nato/>

Formed in 1949 with the signing of the Washington Treaty, [[NATO
is]{.mark} a **[security alliance of 30 countries]{.mark}**]{.underline}
from North America and Europe. NATO's fundamental goal is to safeguard
the Allies' freedom and security by political and military means. NATO
remains the principal security instrument of the transatlantic community
and expression of its common democratic values. It is the practical
means through which the security of North America and Europe are
permanently tied together. NATO enlargement has furthered the U.S. goal
of a Europe whole, free, and at peace.

[Article 5 of the Washington Treaty --- that an attack against one Ally
is an attack against all --- is at the core of the
Alliance]{.underline}, a promise of collective defense. Article 4 of the
treaty ensures consultations among Allies on security matters of common
interest, which have expanded from a narrowly defined Soviet threat to
the critical mission in Afghanistan, as well as peacekeeping in Kosovo
and new threats to security such as cyber attacks, and global threats
such as terrorism and piracy that affect the Alliance and its global
network of partners.

In addition to its traditional role in the territorial defense of Allied
nations, NATO leads the UN-mandated International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan and has ongoing missions in the Balkans and
the Mediterranean; it also conducts extensive training exercises and
offers security support to partners around the globe, including the
European Union in particular but also the United Nations and the African
Union.

MEMBER STATES

The NATO Alliance consists of 30 member states from North America and
Europe. Article Five of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs
against one of the member states, it should be considered an attack
against all members, and other members shall assist the attacked member,
with armed forces if necessary.

List of Member States

Over the past two decades, the Alliance has developed a network of
structured partnerships with countries from the Euro-Atlantic area, the
Mediterranean and the Gulf region, as well as individual relationships
with other partners across the globe. NATO pursues dialogue and
practical cooperation with many partner countries and engages actively
with other international actors and organisations on a wide range of
political and security-related issues.

2.3.3. NATO Actions in Yugoslavia

[A controversial topic with regard to the **responsibility of
international organisations**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} the attack
carried out by **[NATO]{.underline}** on Yugoslavia. As is well
established, [NATO is an **international legal
personality**]{.underline} [capable of **engaging in
i**]{.underline}nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations.
[The]{.underline} military **[operation]{.underline}** [was carried out
based on a]{.underline} **[decision]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline}
North Atlantic Council, the political **[governing body of
NATO]{.underline}**. When it became clear that during the bombardments
damages were inflicted on other than military targets on Yugoslavian
territory, NATO paid compensation to individuals whose properties were
damaged. Clearly, the member states did never consent to the execution
of those failed missions. Nevertheless, Yugo-Slavia decided to bring
[claims against the]{.underline} [**NATO members separately**,
and]{.underline} **[not NATO itself]{.underline}**, before the European
Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and the International Court of Justice.
NATO is neither a party to the ICJ Statute nor to the ECHR, so there was
no other alternative. This implied that the NATO cover of the missions
had to be lifted in order to effectively bring a complaint. During the
proceedings, [the]{.underline} NATO **[members]{.underline}**
surprisingly did not bring forth the [argument that it was]{.underline}
the **[NATO]{.underline}** [carrying out the attacks and]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[member states]{.underline}**,
and that the member [states could rely on the liability of the
**alliance**]{.underline}. Therefore, neither the ICJ nor the ECHR had
to deal with the issue during those proceedings. NATO has the capacity
to Carry out military attacks such as those in Yugoslavia, but was in
casu not called upon to answer for the incurred damages. On the other
hand, a decision of the North Atlantic Council is an authoritative
instrument, and states should be able to rely on its legitimacy when
carrying out the decision as long as they remain within the mandate
given.

#### The difference is [vital]{.underline} and [fundamental]{.underline}

of the National War College in Washington, D.C., "Operation Enduring
Freedom and the Future of NATO," Georgetown Journal of International
Affairs, vol. 3, no. 2, Georgetown University Press, 2002, pp. 51--56

[The U.S. -led]{.underline} military [action]{.underline} in Afghanistan
in response to the attacks of September II [raised]{.underline} a number
of [important issues regarding the future of]{.underline} the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**) [and the
relationship between the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and its transatlantic **allies**]{.underline}.
On September 12, , NATO invoked Arti- cle 5 - the mutual defense clause
of the Washington Treaty - thereby committing NATO to help defend the
United States from the perpetrators of the attacks. Shortly thereafter,
NATO sent seven of its Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS)
aircraft, crews, and ground support personnel to assist in the air
defense of the United States. In addition to demonstrating NATO\'s
military resolve and buttressing the political declaration of Article 5»
the deployment of NATO AWACS aircraft also freed up U.S. aircraft for
Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

NATO also provided blanket air rights for U.S. aircraft, access to bases
and ports, and other non-combat support. However, NATO did not lead
Operation Enduring Freedom, nor did it develop the International
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) deployed to Afghanistan in the wake of
the American rout of the Taliban. The Europeans expected more of a say
in the planning and execution of operations since the alliance had stood
firm with the United States after the attacks. [Since the
understanding]{.underline} for fifty years [had been that
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[would come to the aid of Europe and lead its defense, it was only
natural to]{.underline} **[assume]{.underline}** that
**[Europe]{.underline}** [would play a]{.underline} **[large
role]{.underline}** [if the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [was]{.underline} **[attacked]{.underline}**.
However, [**this was not the case**; the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [preferred a coalition
involving NATO]{.underline} **[members]{.underline}** [but]{.underline}
**[not NATO itself]{.underline}**.

European [members of NATO asked whether this]{.underline} American
**[unilateralism]{.underline}** [portended the]{.underline} **[end of
the alliance]{.underline}**. Americans vigorously denied this, and
argued for a broader conception of NATO. Nevertheless, Operation
Enduring Freedom was a landmark event because [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [chose to use
a]{.underline} **[loose coalition]{.underline}**
**[instead]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} [**NATO alliance**, a
decision that revealed an emerging]{.underline} U.S. -NATO [relationship
in which the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[consults]{.underline}** with
[NATO]{.underline} on security issues [but acts]{.underline} **[outside
the alliance structure]{.underline}** when it is in America\'s interest.

Why the United States Didn\'t Turn to NATO. In the aftermath of
September II, the United States wanted the form of a coalition, but not
the sub- stance, for several reasons. First, the attacks were on
American soil, and consequently the United States had to lead the
response. Although citizens from scores of countries were killed in the
attacks, it was clear that the United States, its people and its
homeland, was the intended victim. Therefore, a response to the
terrorist attacks did not automatically involve NATO. Ultimately, there
was no direct link to Europe. Consulting NATO would have been
unrealistic, and no American administration would have waited for NATO
to form a response.

NATO was also not the United States\'s first choice because there is no
clear consensus on how to interpret the Washington Treaty in the
post-Cold War world. For example, although the treaty does not place
explicit restrictions on NATO operations in a geographical sense or
require United Nations approval for its operations, many members have
conceptual difficulty expanding NATO\'s role beyond the alliance\'s
immediate periphery, especially in the absence of UN man- dates for such
operations. Consequently, [rather than get **embroiled**]{.underline}
[in discussions regarding the]{.underline} **[legality of NATO
participation]{.underline}** in Afghanistan, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[sidestepped]{.underline}** [the issue and worked with its **allies
outside of official NATO channels**]{.underline}.

Credible cyber deterrence was associated with international
cybersecurity cooperation and Estonia's efforts to strengthen
international cyberspace stability. In this respect, this document
communicated a view of the Estonian Foreign Policy Development Plan
2030, but provided more details. For example, hosting international
cybersecurity events and cyber exercises in Estonia, establishing
NATO-associated facilities (such as NATO's cyber range and NATO CCDCOE
located in Tallinn) and other allied infrastructure in the country are
considered important for fostering credible deterrence. In like manner,
binding agreements with key allies and regular cyber defence exercises
and training sessions are seen as mechanisms for implementing cyber
deterrence in practice.84 Notably, Estonia has bilateral cybersecurity
and cyber defence agreements with several NATO allies (the US and
France), and has established a joint platform for secure cyber threat
intelligence-sharing with the US. Thus, operational-level and technical
bi- and multilateral cooperation, including information- and
intelligence-sharing and technical exercises, are viewed as critical
components of strategic deterrence against cyberattacks.85 This reflects
a pragmatic understanding that high-level political declarations and
commitment cannot deter cyberattacks, but timely cyber threat
intelligence can.

In accordance with the strategy, a necessary element of deterrence is an
ability to attribute cyberattacks. The strategy prescribes developing a
procedure to attribute attacks, which includes political, legal and
technical criteria (this mechanism 23 was established in 2019) and
measures to attribute cyberattacks in the grey zone (below the threshold
of armed attack). Estonia must actively attribute attacks together with
partners and implement collective countermeasures.8

Greater Collaboration with Allies and Partners. In addition to
combatting cybercrime, nations must also work together to decrease their
vulnerability to attack and reduce the consequences of a successful
attack. Collaboration on cybersecurity defenses, technology,
organizations, training, and exercises across both military and civilian
portions of the network is an essential step toward cybersecurity. While
no defense is perfect in cyberspace, more can be done to improve upon
the status quo.

On the civilian side, constant and regular engagement among U.S. and
foreign Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and Computer Security
Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) is a necessity.29

Such engagement must not only occur when there is a cyber incident, but
must take place regularly to ensure that all sides know their
counterparts and have developed formal as well as informal
relationships. This requires that the U.S. and partner CERTs/CSRITs have
the resources to deal not only with the technical and
information-sharing aspects of cybersecurity, but also to build
relationships with cybersecurity experts in other countries. The U.S.
should encourage allies to expand cyber capabilities and expand
cross-border training and exercises to prepare for cyber incidents.

Beyond the response aspects, the U.S. must also seek greater cooperation
with allies on cybersecurity policies and strategies. While improved
technical capabilities, trust, and relationships between those in the
trenches on cybersecurity are critically important, policymakers and
strategists are necessary to ensure that such capabilities and
relationships are advancing U.S. and allied interests and objectives.
The Russians and Chinese have each developed their own ways of
integrating cyber weapons and tools into their hybrid or information
warfare strategies. Indeed, they do not just have strategies on paper,
but are putting them to work in Ukraine, the U.S. political arena, the
South China Sea, and elsewhere.

The U.S. must have a fully formed cyber strategy that includes both
civilian and military components. U.S. military planners and their
international partners must consider how allied forces will fight in
cyberspace. In 2016, NATO declared cyberspace to be a domain of warfare
in the same way that the air or the seas are.30

Such a declaration is overdue, and preparations to fight in this domain
must now play catch up. NATO members and other allies must make
investments in cyber capabilities that will protect and advance military
objectives, in addition to much-needed investments in traditional tools
of warfare. The U.S. should push for expanded partner preparation and
capabilities in the domain, offering assistance where it can. Similarly,
training in cyberspace and hybrid conflicts are necessary to enable the
U.S. and allies to be prepared for future conflicts.

Furthermore, policymakers need to devise ways of ensuring that the
private sector is also playing a leading role in cybersecurity.
Government-to-government cooperation on cybersecurity must ultimately be
built on private-sector expertise and control. In many countries,
including the U.S., critical infrastructure is primarily owned and
operated by the private sector. Even in countries where this is not
true, the private sector still provides the vast majority of the goods
and services, faces countless cyber attacks, and serves as the greatest
repository of expertise on cybersecurity. So, any government policies on
cybersecurity require true partnership with, and reliance on, the
private sector. This reality should not be lost in efforts to increase
cooperation between governments but should inform the way policy
cooperation occurs.

Responding to Cyber Aggression

While there is much the U.S. can and should do to defend against cyber
aggression both independently and in conjunction with allies and
partners, the U.S. should also go beyond just defending its systems.
Given the nature of cyberspace as described earlier, defense will not
always succeed. When faced with an offensive-dominated domain, the U.S.
can instead seek to raise the costs of hacking through various types of
retaliation. These forms of retaliation should be viewed as a toolbox
that can be used and tweaked depending on the aggressor to which the
U.S. is responding.

As the Army prepares for the possibility of near-peer conflict and
focuses on increasing its expeditionary agility, developing and
maintaining the ability to interoperate quickly and effectively with
highly capable allies will become increasingly important. A key reason
that U.S., British, and Australian personnel have been able to work
together so well in recent operations is the steady state interactions
between these allies, ranging from high-level embeds, multinational
exercises (e.g., joint warfighter exercises), education and training
programs,10 and officer and unit exchange programs (e.g., the Military
Personnel Exchange Program). However, the British Army explicitly states
that the integration skills jointly developed during nearly five years
in Afghanistan are perishable and that a comprehensive defense
engagement program to preserve these lessons should be developed: "The
challenge during this fallow period before the next coalition operation
is how to start the next operation as an integrated coalition,
capitalising \[sic\] on those coalition synergies from the start."11

Implications

Given the relative dearth of SC activities during ongoing operations,
the low likelihood that these will become more common in future
operations, and the importance of steady-state SC activities for
preparing units and personnel to work together rapidly and effectively
in the absence of predeployment training, we identified the following
implications:

• Steady state SC activities between the United States and highly
capable allies should continue to focus on providing opportunities for
developing and exercising operational partnering. As discussed, such
efforts are a central aspect of security relationships between the
United States and its closest partners. These activities should
emphasize not only developing soldiers' skills and familiarity but also
developing procedures for shared communications, processes, and
logistics. Waiting until an operation occurs is too late to develop
operational partnerships.

• Mission-essential tasks related to multinational interoperability
should be considered for steady-state U.S. unit training to enable
swift, effective operational partnering. For units that engage in
multinational training, incorporating interoperability and operational
partnering into unit mission-essential task lists could help ensure that
the appropriate activities are highlighted in exercises with highly
capable allies that prepare them to work together not only in near-peer
conflicts, but also contingency operations in other contexts.12

United States and Allies Share Information, But Only Opportunistically

At a basic level, most SC is about sharing information. Although most
information sharing through SC occurs outside ongoing operations, we
analyzed activities that were designed to share lessons with highly
capable partners during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. As with
predeployment training, formally organized cooperative activities to
share operationally relevant lessons were rare. That said, throughout
our research, we sought examples that demonstrated how valuable it was
for U.S., British, and Australian forces to share operational lessons
with each other. A few representative examples stand out.

As previously mentioned, the United States and United Kingdom occupied a
shared battlespace in Afghanistan's Regional Command Southwest and
integrated their air and targeting efforts to prevent seams and help
optimize support for ground forces. At a more micro level, U.S. and
British personnel consistently shared lessons learned and incorporated
them into their evolving TTPs. For instance, a procedure routinely used
by Royal Navy pilots that was seen as good operational practice was
adopted by the rest of the United Kingdom's Joint Aviation Group as well
as the U.S. Marine Corps' Air Combat Element, which extended to briefing
formats and general mission business.13 U.S. Marines deployed to
Regional Command Southwest credited the United Kingdom with helping them
refine their targeting practices, particularly how best to use the
varying capabilities of multiple intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance platforms tasked with tracking one or a group of
potential targets.14

Given that distribution of lessons learned within the Army---much less
at the joint and combined force levels---is highly problematic,15 these
types of information-sharing activities tended to emerge organically
rather than as part of an institutionalized sharing process. When we
followed up with operators on how lessons tended to be shared, we were
told that information sharing generally occurred through three pathways.
First, personnel found themselves in the same place at the same time and
informally discussed their operational experiences with each
other---that is, they "talked shop." Second, if personnel were aware of
each other's operations, they might reach out for insights in the face
of current challenges. Third, embedded partner personnel would act as
formal or informal liaisons to share lessons with personnel from both
countries. Operators noted that sharing lessons was helpful, but it
generally only occurred opportunistically. This raises the concern that
fewer lessons are shared with allies than is optimal during operations.

On the other hand, the Combined Joint Task Force in OIR experienced
severe difficulty formally sharing information among coalition partners,
largely because of differing communication systems and problems with
classification. It was not until the joint operations center began to
use Global Command and Control System--Joint that coalition personnel
could fully see the required common operational picture needed for the
operation. An insight reported by the Center for Army Lessons Learned
suggested that plans for information sharing across the coalition should
be in place before an operation starts.16

When we asked interview respondents about potential shortcomings in
operationally relevant information sharing, many thought that developing
a mechanism for sharing operationally relevant observations across
coalition partners would be useful---particularly if these mechanisms
were made available to units prior to deployment.

Implications

Documenting lessons learned and sharing information between different
offices and across time is a perennial challenge for the Army. Our first
two implications focus on enabling bottom-up communications between
units undertaking similar missions of operating in similar environments.
The third and fourth focus on shared communications infrastructure:

• Develop updated guidance for deployed U.S. units on lessons learned
for communications with allied units. Communications sometimes happen
naturally in an operational setting. However, the Army could formalize
guidance to deployed units on identifying allied counterpart units that
have conducted or are conducting similar operations in the combined
battlespace and initiating interactions designed to share experiences.
Such exchanges could help each unit address challenges that have arisen
during operations.

• In instances in which the United States and an ally have developed
clear interoperability workarounds in the field, ensure that they are
incorporated into interoperability plans and roadmaps. Successful
workarounds are important to capture and archive for use in future
operations and exercises with the ally; they could also be improved and
expanded to include other allies.

• Formal, pre-established information-sharing mechanisms should be in
place to increase lines of communication on combined lessons learned
during operations. DoD efforts toward establishing and exercising
mission partner environments can serve as the foundation for a shared
communications network.17

• Capturing allied lessons learned would be useful as part of the Joint
Lessons Learned Information System. Building a separate allies and
partners lessons learned information system might be unnecessary;
including such a lessons learned portal as part of an operational
communications infrastructure might be useful. Within this portal,
providing a template for contributing observations and a list of common
topics for tagging observations would increase the value of captured
data.

Engagement Partnering for Future Shaping

Both the United States and its key allies also engage in SC with third
countries to pursue strategic interests focused on long-term
competition. The objectives for these activities tend to be (1) building
partner capacity to shape and maintain regional stability or to prepare
for possible operations, (2) increasing access or influence in key
geographic areas, and (3) improving U.S. and allied strategic
competitiveness vis-à-vis other global actors. Most SC engagements with
third parties occur bilaterally, but in recent years initiatives have
been undertaken to coordinate allied efforts.

Building Partner Capacity for Future Operations

The United States and its European allies have placed greater emphasis
on building partner capacity for engaging in conventional military
operations since 2014. U.S. Section 333 SC capacity-building projects in
the U.S. European Command have increasingly been targeted at the Eastern
European flank. Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada have also
increased their contributions to partnership capacity building through
their leadership of Enhanced Forward Presence battlegroups in Lithuania,
Estonia, and Latvia, respectively.27 Other efforts include TACET, which
was created by Germany and the United States to synchronize military
training and exercises in the Baltic states and Poland, and the Combined
Joint Enhanced Training Initiative, which provides coordinated training
in Bulgaria and Romania.28 These initiatives have evolved into other
efforts, such as the Capability Enhancement Regional Symposium, a
multilateral forum in which NATO allies and key partners share regional
situational awareness and visibility on their bilateral activities with
the Baltic states and Poland. The Capability Enhancement Regional
Symposium has been focused on evolving threats, such as multidomain
awareness and cyber security.29

U.S. capacity-building efforts in the Pacific region are growing as
well, with dedicated funding toward building ally and partner maritime
security capabilities. The Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia
are examples of participants in the South East Asia Maritime Security
Initiative. The Army's Pacific Pathways program has included bilateral
(and some multinational) exercises with Indonesia, Japan, Korea,
Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand to build partner
capacity.30

These efforts were strengthened by coordinated regional engagements with
Australia, Japan, and South Korea to build maritime security and domain
awareness in the region. As with the United States, many of the partner
capacity-building efforts undertaken by Australia and other highly
capable allies are conducted on a bilateral basis. Examples include
engagements by the Australian Defence Force to train the Armed Forces of
the Philippines on countering complex urban terrorist tactics and
maritime training initiative.
