### Cohesion

#### NATO cohesion necessary to maintain stable world order

**NATO 20** (Group Appointed by the NATO Secretary General, NATO 2030;
United for a New Era, 11/25/2020,
<https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/12/pdf/201201-Reflection-Group-Final-Report-Uni.pdf>)
-LH

In spite of these challenges, **[NATO remains
indispensable]{.underline}**. In fact, the fundamental purpose of NATO
is more demonstrably clear today than it has been for decades. NATO has
weathered stormy times before, surviving the Soviet threat, the Suez
Crisis, divisions among Allies over the Vietnam war, dictatorships in
its own ranks, the Euromissile debates, disagreements over enlargement,
and the Iraq War---just to name a few. Now, as then, [Allies have
remained bound together by a combination of shared principles,
democratic institutions, and the benefit that all Allies derive from
collective security]{.underline}. Looking out to 2030[, the need for a
collective defence Alliance to protect Europe and North America against
threats to their physical security and democratic way of life is as
strong as ever]{.underline}.

Yet [NATO will have to continue to adapt]{.underline}. In a world of
systemic challengers and proliferating threats, [the
Alliance,]{.underline} in complementarity with the comprehensive
military adaptation it has undergone, [must cement its ability to act as
the principal political forum for the strategic and geopolitical
challenges facing the transatlantic community. Fulfilling this **role
will require even greater cohesion** than NATO has possessed in recent
years]{.underline}. As it has since NATO's founding, [cohesion resides
in the ability and will to act collectively against shared
threats]{.underline}. This is the lifeblood that ensures the vitality,
credibility, and durability of the Alliance[; it becomes all the more
important in a sharpened competitive environment that requires
collaboration and effective networks to deal with growing
threats]{.underline}.

In recent years, [Allies have strengthened the military component of
NATO and should continue to do so]{.underline}. But [in parallel, **they
must move decisively to bolster the political dimension of NATO**,
including its foundations of shared democratic principles, mechanisms of
consultation, processes of decision-making, and political
tools]{.underline} for responding to current and emerging threats. [If
they do so, NATO will be in a strong position to protect the freedom and
security of its members and **act as an essential pillar of an open and
stable international order**.]{.underline}

#### Cohesive NATO approach to cyber operations will be critical in dealing with cyber threats

**Shea 18** (Jamie Shea, Dr. Jamie Shea is deputy assistant secretary
general for emerging security challenges at NATO, "Cyberspace as a
Domain of Operations What Is NATO's Vision and Strategy?" MCU Journal,
vol 9, no 2, Fall 2018, <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1068701.pdf)->

In sum, 2016 was the year when the cyberthreat ceased being a concern
primarily for individual entities, such as banks, critical
infrastructure providers, or hospitals worried about losing data, to
become an instrument of hybrid warfare, where the state and society are
virtually under permanent attack. [The **problem with cyber** is that,
because it is so easy to use, **states may decide to attack targets and
risk an increase in international tensions** that they would probably
refrain from doing if they had to use more conventional]{.underline} and
overtly aggressive [means]{.underline}. So [cyber blurs the clear
distinction between war and peace]{.underline} and creates a sense that
[everything a state normally believes it has under control]{.underline}
(its administration, election processes, critical infrastructure, key
supply chains, and economy) [is now being contested]{.underline} or is
even under permanent siege.

[Given this multiplicity of cyber threats and attack vectors, the
concept of what a state needs to defend has shifted]{.underline}. It is
now no longer a specific strategic asset, such as an oil refinery or
airfield, or a particular invasion route, such as the Fulda Gap in
Germany during the Cold War, but it becomes virtually any kind of
critical national infrastructure---from undersea internet cables to
banks; electricity grids; industrial control systems (ICS);
telecommunications; and gas, oil, and water pipelines.13 [The scope is
almost endless. **The state cannot hope to achieve full protection of
all these complex and often interdependent networks
alone**]{.underline}. It has to prioritize and delegate protective
responsibilities to the regional or local level or to the private sector
that owns and operates much of this critical infrastructure. In terms of
basic cybersecurity, it becomes the duty of care and risk calculation of
the individual citizen. Cyberspace has rapidly become a domain where
everyone is calling upon everyone else to take action. The individual
calls on the bank to provide better protection, the bank demands better
software from the tech company, the tech company recommends better
insurance coverage, while claiming that it is only a platform to post
and transmit data and has no particular responsibility for the content.
Meanwhile, the state has to decide whether regulation or voluntary
effort is the best way to induce companies and individuals to improve
their cyber hygiene and restore trust in a cyberspace that is an
increasingly important part of economic growth.

[For military establishments and an organization such as
NATO]{.underline}, fully establishing cyberspace as an operational
domain imposes clear cultural shifts and organizational adaptations,
with the follow-on impacts for all other operational domains.
[Cyberspace cannot be a separate silo but has to be integrated with all
these other operational domains.]{.underline} Operations in cyberspace
need to be designed to support conventional military activity, as a
force multiplier, and vice versa. [This means that **commands must
understand, trust**, and be prepared to employ all
capabilities]{.underline} and determine those situations where the use
of a cyber effect would perform a military task more quickly,
efficiently, or more cheaply than a conventional weapon. An example is
the debate in the Barack H. Obama administration during the Libya
conflict in 2011 over whether to use cruise missiles or cyberattacks to
take down Muammar Gaddafi's air defenses.14 This debate revolved around
cost-effectiveness, durability of impact, and the international
precedent that might be created by the U.S. use of military cyber
capabilities. [Essentially, it means understanding the characteristics
of offensive cyber and what it can and cannot achieve and the risks in
terms of cost-benefit analysis. Collateral damage is one such
risk]{.underline} as cyber tends to have horizontal rather than vertical
effects through the nature of the hyper-connectivity of the internet.
When the Stuxnet worm was used in 2010 against the Siemens operating
software at the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran, it was introduced
via a USB stick outside the internet and was designed to infiltrate only
one type of software.15 It was seen as preferable to military actions,
because it was covert, highly specific, and a way to minimize violence
even if hundreds of Iranian centrifuges would be incapacitated. Yet, it
ended up on the internet and traces of [Stuxnet were found subsequently
in 36 countries. Thus, **greater transparency will be needed between
those allies,** such as]{.underline} the United Kingdom, [that have
publicly announced their willingness to voluntarily contribute national
cyber effects to NATO]{.underline}. Additionally, [NATO commanders will
need to identify which effects are potentially available, what are the
targets to which they apply, and how quickly they can be generated in a
crisis or conflict scenario]{.underline}, but above all [what the actual
impact and fallout of such cybereffects]{.underline} are likely to be.

NATO has defined a mechanism for this transfer of cyber effects from the
nation to the NATO command structure under the political oversight and
control of the alliance. A Cyberspace Operations Centre (CYOC) is being
established at Allied Command Operations (formerly SHAPE) in Mons,
Belgium, to enhance early warning, carry out strategic and operational
planning, factor cyber realistically into NATO training and exercises,
and define the scope of joint cyber/conventional operations. Soldiers,
sailors, airmen and airwomen, and NATO civilians who operate in other
domains must be as ready to support cyberspace operations as those who
regularly operate in cyberspace are ready to support any other joint
operation. This will without a doubt generate the need for more cyber
defense specialists and also more training and education for senior
military and civilian leaders across the NATO enterprise in both the
military and political ramifications of using cyberspace. For instance,
a recent crisis-management exercise organized by Estonia for EU defense
ministers (called CYBRID), which simulated a series of cyberattacks
against an EU maritime force in the central Mediterranean, revealed
several weaknesses. First, one weakness was the reticence of attributing
the attacks and the amount of evidence required to attribute them
properly. Second, it was difficult to determine whether the
characteristic of the attack was simply hostile behavior or actual armed
aggression. Third, there was a weakness in the political willingness to
assign blame, as well as weaknesses in the usefulness of a number of
possible response or retaliatory options (the "toolbox"). This pointed
to a need for better coordination from the top.

So, as with the evolution of nuclear deterrence in the 1950s, [it makes
little sense to develop cyber capabilities and technical expertise if
the leadership has a poor grasp of the conditions determining if, when,
and how a cyber effect can be used]{.underline}. There is also the
possibility that cyber effects are designed foremost for deterrence
purposes and signaling rather than for actual battlefield use. [This
means regular **crisis management exercising to synchronize military and
political thinking** and decision-making cycles is
**required**]{.underline}. Such exercises can help to develop a
comprehensive set of crisis response options involving cyber and/or
combined cyber and conventional actions. Over time, a basic
understanding of attribution methodology needs to be acquired so that
what is deemed sufficient at the national level is also adequate for
other nations to adhere to and express solidarity through collective
action. A good example of this, albeit in the area of 2 chemical
weapons, is the attribution by the British government to Russia of the
Novichok nerve agent, used against two Russian citizens in Salisbury,
United Kingdom, in March 2018.16 Once the UK's findings were presented
to NATO and the EU, the member states simultaneously expelled a
significant number of Russian diplomats and agreed to clamp down on
Russian intelligence operations in their territories.

As these retaliatory actions become more frequent (e.g., Special
Prosecutor Robert Mueller's grand jury recently indicted 12 Russian Main
Intelligence Directorate \[GRU\] officers for their alleged involvement
in hacking into the U.S. election campaign), it will also be important
to analyze which of this expanding toolbox of responses below the
threshold of an Article 5-type of military response actually has an
impact in changing the strategic calculus and behavior of our
adversaries.17 Or, in other words, what can be done to change the
current calculus of cyber as a low-risk, high-gain operation into one
that is high risk and low gain? For instance, do unilateral or
collective retaliations work better over time than bilateral agreements,
such as the 2013 U.S.-China agreement on restraint in cyberspace?18
[What is the **practical benefit of international norms** and
confidence-building measures]{.underline}, such as the two packages
endorsed by the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe (OSCE)?19 At all events, it is clear that we still have a long
way to go before states recognize the essential red lines of effective
cyber deterrence and stability; for instance, noninterference in
political processes, refraining from attacks on critical national
infrastructure, refraining from attacks on the "public core" of the
internet, agreeing on common standards for attribution, and agreeing
that attacks on nuclear command and control or vital space observation
and communication satellites are impermissible. Even if a universal
agreement establishing these red lines (i.e., by the United Nations
Group of Governmental Experts) still seems a long way off, embedding
them in regional or "mini-lateral" frameworks such as the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Commonwealth, or the African Union
seems possible, and NATO could usefully take them up in its own
partnership frameworks. For instance, [a **mutual agreement on certain
norms could be embedded in NATO's individual cyber cooperation**
agreements with partner countries, alongside the technical exchanges
such agreements usually provide]{.underline}. A memorandum of
understanding with Finland has already been concluded and can lead the
way to similar agreements with like-minded countries, such as Sweden,
Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.

#### Cohesive NATO is Critical for Deterrence of Russia and China

Marcus **Kolga 21**, Marcus Kolga is a senior fellow at the
Macdonald-Laurier Institute's Centre for Advancing Canada's Interests
Abroad., 10-5-2021, accessed 6/28/2022, \"Improving NATO's cohesion is
critical to combat Russia and China's threat: Marcus Kolga for Inside
Policy,\" Macdonald-Laurier Institute,

//3AM

[A united NATO is critically important to projecting credible
deterrence. The erosion of domestic trust and confidence in the Alliance
among its member states]{.underline}, including Canada, [represents a
threat to this cohesion.]{.underline} A proposal to withdraw Canada from
NATO was tabled at a recent policy conference for one of Canada's three
major political parties. The proposal was defeated, but it represents a
fringe anti-NATO narrative within Canada's illiberal left; if left
unaddressed, such a narrative could grow.

[If countries like Russia perceive NATO as an atomized collection of
states with varied priorities rather than a unified front, the Alliance
is exposed to a significant risk of miscalculation in which a foreign
adversary might believe they can cross a red line and only face a
limited response. Thus, gaps in cohesion within the alliance directly
threaten to undermine political and military deterrence. The Alliance
and members states must work towards improving
communication]{.underline}s strategies to foster greater basic general
understanding of NATO's purpose, its missions and its role in protecting
its members against external threats.

Similarly, [if we see threats as atomized]{.underline} or disparate, [we
may lack the capacity to adequately respond.]{.underline} Organized GRU
[terrorist attacks in Czechia, the Salisbury poisonings, transnational
repression and censorship, cyberwarfare, disinformation, and overt
military posturing all pose threats]{.underline} that are [aimed
at]{.underline} the same essential goal: [undermining]{.underline} [and
supplanting the power of liberal democracy and advancing
authoritarianism.]{.underline} Through this lens, challenges posed by
other actors, including China, must also be considered as part of the
broader range of shared threats posed to the democratic community as a
whole.

[If we are to succeed in tackling these shared threats, greater
transatlantic cooperation is needed.]{.underline} It cannot remain
stagnant, however; it must evolve and expand. The serious nature of the
threats, their potential to become kinetic, and the possibility of
adversarial coordination (whether formal or informal) means that we must
expand our tools to meet these challenges.

In the case of Ukraine, on whose border the Kremlin mobilized over
100,000 troops this past summer, the Alliance should consider extending
a Membership Action Plan despite the skepticism of some allies. Ukraine
must also be empowered in a similar fashion to frontline NATO states
like the Baltic states and Poland. After all, the eFP mission in Latvia
not only provides military deterrence, but strengthens interlinkages,
develops societal resilience, and provides clear and sustained
solidarity.

Finally, the growing threats of foreign interference, information
warfare, cyber attacks and emerging threats to Canada's Arctic requires
a coherent long-term strategy and an evolved notion of collective
defence, which includes strengthening our partnerships with non-NATO
allies in Europe, Asia, and around the world.

[Until we impose consequences]{.underline} that force [Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline} to strategically reconsider their ongoing efforts
to probe the extreme boundaries of our threat tolerance, they [will
continue to test our capacity and political will to confront their
aggression. This requires a common understanding]{.underline} and
acknowledgement [of]{.underline} the [threats.]{.underline} It took
Russian aggression in 2007 in Estonia, 2008 in Georgia, and the invasion
of Ukraine in 2014 to achieve a basic common understanding of the threat
posed by Vladimir Putin's government. Since then, NATO's eFP missions
have thus far deterred Vladimir Putin's neo-imperialist ambitions in the
Baltic Sea region.

[We must work towards achieving a similar consensus on the threats posed
by Russia and China]{.underline}'s use of information and influence
operations, as well as economic, cyber and political warfare against the
community of democracies and the developing world at large in order to
develop resilience and a common defence against them.

**NATO intelligence sharing key to allied response**

**Maigre 22** (Merle Maigre is a Non-resident Senior Fellow with CEPA\'s
Transatlantic Leadership Program and CEPA\'s Digital Innovation
Initiative, 4/6/22, accessed 6/24/22, "NATO's Role In Global
CyberSecurity",

[[https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security)
(JB)

Four sets of actions for NATO are proposed. First, denying covertness by
attribution: [NATO should persuade opponents that they cannot be
clandestine in their cyber actions.]{.underline} NATO and its members
need to demonstrate that it is difficult or impossible to act covertly
and be clear about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks.

Until recently, governments did not publicly release details on cyber
incidents. But since 2018, public disclosures of cyberattacks by several
Western powers indicate a new multinational policy of state
transparency. The growing relevance of attribution is partially due to
states becoming better at attributing cyber operations. Greater public
knowledge of cyberattacks heightens awareness of cyber conflicts and
leads to greater public acceptance of cyber countermeasures.

[Ultimately, what matters is that **states engaging in unlawful actions
using cyber means will face consequences.** With attribution,
policymakers show that they know what is happening in these networks and
can investigate incidents.]{.underline} It also clearly spells out
unacceptable behavior and can help create state practice. [The **[best
way to implement]{.mark}**]{.underline} the international norms [[**is
by** calling out behavior and having **consequences when**
]{.mark}**these [norms are breached]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Attribution
will make clear to the malicious actor that their actions will be seen
and addressed. It is the basis, under international law, for
countermeasures and self-defense.

When should states publicly attribute cyberattacks? Effective public
attribution requires a clear understanding of the attributed cyber
operation and the cyber-threat actor, but also the broader geopolitical
environment, allied positions and activities, and the legal context. The
public attribution framework put forward by Max Smeets and Florian
Egloff in March
2021[[27]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote27_pukyrym)

distinguishes four factors that act as enablers or constraints in public
attribution. These factors are intelligence, incident severity,
geopolitical context, and post-attribution actions. The combination of
these four components enables consistent decision-making about whether
to publicly disseminate information about an adversary's actions,
privately tell the adversary, or restrict knowledge of the intrusion to
the government and potentially other partners.

Collecting and processing intelligence---information about foreign
countries and their agents---provides a technical basis for attribution.
How could allies improve intelligence sharing to conduct more rapid
attribution and enable a response to adversary cyber activity? During
the Nordic-Baltic foreign ministers meeting in Tallinn in September
2020, a 90-minute tabletop exercise was
organized[[28]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote28_cpch8u5)

to test the ministers' ability to respond to and attribute an escalating
cyberattack. They answered multiple-choice questions on communication of
and possible diplomatic countermeasures to the attack. The ministers
learned through first-hand experience that [a timely exchange of
technical intelligence can be key in attributing any
cyberattack]{.underline}. "The shared view \[of the countries
involved\]---especially when it comes to complicated issues---is
crucial," said Urmas Reinsalu, Foreign Minister of
Estonia.[[29]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote29_topliia)

Attribution is only as good as the information that allies are willing
to share. NATO's value can be in becoming the preferred platform for
sharing cyber information. General Paul Nakasone, who heads US Cyber
Command, told the House Armed Services subcommittee on intelligence that
"in 35 years" he has never seen a better sharing of accurate, timely,
and actionable intelligence than what has transpired with
Ukraine.[[30]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote30_qki9qsu)

[**[Sharing information and intelligence with allies "builds coalitions"
and can "shine a light on disinformation"
campaigns]{.underline}**,]{.mark} like the one Russia used to lay the
groundwork for their invasion of Ukraine.

As the second course of action, [[**NATO should**]{.mark} use the
current crisis to]{.underline} accelerate the progress with setting up
NATO's own cyber command and [[**sharpen allied responses** to malicious
cyber actions]{.underline}.]{.mark} Overall, **[this [would give more
credibility to its cyber defense]{.mark}]{.underline}.** In February
2019, allies endorsed a set of tools to respond to cumulative cyber
activities, but not much has happened to take it forward. It is now time
to build upon this set and develop concrete steps at the political,
military, and technical levels to model alliance behavior according to
the threat landscape. This means a sharper focus on future responses to
high- and low-end cyberattacks along with concrete deterrence actions
and tools for individual sectors and target types. [Much of this is
based on the high-end cyber capabilities of select individual
allies]{.underline} called "volunteer sovereign cyber effects," [where
cyber-capable nations deliver voluntarily offensive cyber effects on a
target designated by an operational-level commander.]{.underline} The
NATO Cyber Command would be responsible for matching military needs with
the willingness and capabilities of the nations potentially able to
deliver such
effects.[[31]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote31_9likw2h)

[[**The alliance should clarify which allies are responsible for
offensive cyber operations against certain targets** and]{.mark} the
[information-sharing and notification requirements]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### US NATO cohesion key to deterring cyber attacks

(JB)

This thesis uses a case study analysis to better understand the effects
of Russian cyber operations. This approach is best to grasp how the
[cyber operations have become more effective and efficient over
time]{.underline}. This has enabled Russia to conduct operations of
similar ends against multiple states in order to further its own
objectives. Russia views NATO expansion as a direct threat to Russia and
reasoning behind this will be analyzed to discover where it fits into
Russian grand strategy. [[**Lack of political cohesion** within the NATO
Alliance **creates a vulnerability for Russia to
exploit.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Political instability and distrust in
the government can be analyzed through the 2016 presidential election,
as well as the election tampering in Europe, because both are important
case studies to showcase how Russia has adapted the use of cyber and
technology to further the effectiveness of its activities. [**[Civil
preparedness and resiliency are key]{.mark}** parts of NATO strength
that Russia has attempted to exploit to diminish NATO's capacity to
respond during a crisis.]{.underline} Dragonfly and NotPetya displayed
the progression of Russian cyber capabilities against critical
infrastructure in a short period of time. The effectiveness and concerns
highlighted by these cases are important to analyze in order for NATO
states to better prepare to defend against cyber operations of this
type. [The disruption and [damage that can be caused through **critical
infrastructure attacks has a global impac**t]{.mark} that far exceeds
that of the United States and NATO.]{.underline}

### NATO key

#### Action via NATO takes advantage of the Alliance's uniquely valuable ability to create foundations of consensus and action beyond the Alliance

Skaluba and Rodihan 22 (Christopher Skaluba and Conor Rodihan, "No
consensus? No problem. Why NATO is still effective," Atlantic Council,
1/18/2022
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/no-consensus-no-problem-why-nato-is-still-effective/)->
LH

As the crisis over Ukraine intensifies, key stakeholders are looking to
Brussels for signs of Western resolve. At the NATO-Russia Council
meeting on January 12, the Alliance delivered: In a vivid expression of
solidarity, it categorically (and unanimously) rejected Russian demands
to forgo future expansion or withdraw forces from member countries.

Yet as the crisis evolves, decisions about how to support Ukraine will
become more difficult, and there's a limit to how unified NATO can
be[.]{.underline} While the West might agree on introducing tough new
economic sanctions and reinforcing the Alliance's eastern flank,
boosting Kyiv's military capacity---by supporting an insurgency, for
instance, or sending anti-tank weapons---will be impossible to achieve
by consensus and is much more likely to come from individual members
than under NATO auspices.

This shouldn't be surprising. Consider Russia's annexation of Crimea in
2014 and its ongoing support for separatists in Ukraine's Donbas region:
NATO actions in support of Kyiv have been more political than
operational, leaving it to individual allies to provide munitions,
equipment, and training to Ukrainian forces. And despite a recurrent
pledge that Ukraine would one day be welcome to join the Alliance, as
well as the sympathy expressed by allies for Ukraine's plight, there's
been precious little progress on this front.

NATO is primarily concerned about defending its members from Russian
aggression---which it is also wary of provoking by supporting the
Ukrainian military.

[Yet despite its lack of meaningful military support for Ukraine, the
crisis has been the animating issue on the Alliance's
agenda]{.underline} since 2014. Russia's attacks on Ukraine and its
support for separatists have [driven major NATO initiatives on
readiness, defense planning, force posture, intelligence, and technology
development]{.underline}, with an eye toward beefing up the Alliance's
northern and eastern flanks and deterring Russia in both the
conventional and sub-threshold realms. [As an institution established to
safeguard Europe, it has successfully geared itself to deter the type of
destabilizing Russian belligerence]{.underline} currently on display.

[Critics of the alliance (and even some supporters) have interpreted
NATO's unwillingness to militarily support
Ukraine]{.underline}---especially during the most significant challenge
to the European security order since the Cold War---[as an indicator of
its declining relevance]{.underline}, timidity, or its divisions. [But
that **overstates the importance of political consensus** to NATO's
value and understates its role as an effective and flexible defensive
alliance]{.underline}. This is a role with potentially critical benefits
for Ukraine.

First, [it sets too high a bar for an alliance of thirty members with
aligned, but distinct, priorities. Unanimity on every issue is
impossible]{.underline}, let alone one as complex as military support to
Ukraine. [Debate and disagreement]{.underline}, as it should be for any
democratic institution, [are built-in features of NATO---not bugs. In
reality]{.underline}, [it's astounding how often NATO does reach
consensus about issues]{.underline} big and small, creating an
unrealistic expectation that it always will. [**The opposite of
consensus is not failure**. Suggesting otherwise turns any debate that
doesn't end harmoniously into an indictment of NATO, playing **straight
into Russian propaganda**.]{.underline}

Second, [a belief that NATO's value is tied primarily to achieving
consensus on every issue misses the more mundane (and important) ways it
supports its allies]{.underline} and partners. [Its affinity for
process---particularly its ability to build a **common situational
understanding** among its members---is an **invaluable
tool**.]{.underline} Habits of [consultation and information sharing,
buttressed by deep cooperation on operations, intelligence sharing,
defense planning, and interoperability, create the **foundation upon
which any consensus is to be built**.]{.underline} Even in the absence
of that agreement, the **[ability to collectively define
threats]{.underline}** and jointly train to confront them [is immensely
valuable]{.underline} in its own right.

Third, [these habits of cooperation give NATO members the **flexibility
to act outside of the Alliance's frameworks**]{.underline}. While NATO
does much by consensus---such as its missions in the Baltic
states---[the skills it helps members develop is central to enabling
them to form separate coalitions for action]{.underline}. This happened
recently with ample success in taking on the Islamic State. Such
flexibility should be a point in NATO's favor, not evidence of its
ineptitude.

In the case of military support for Ukraine, policymakers will find more
attractive alternatives for dealing with Moscow's aggression outside of
the auspices of the Alliance. Up to and including its recent dialogue
with Russia, it has taken a host of consensus actions to support
Ukraine---from condemning Kremlin aggression and standing up for Kyiv
politically to reaffirming its open-door policy with an expectation that
Ukraine will eventually become a member. It might even share
intelligence and develop training and advisory programs for the
Ukrainian military.

And while it won't find a consensus to fight, it could provide the
foundation for certain allies to support Ukrainian forces in ways
consistent with their national priorities outside of NATO. In that case,
NATO's enabling value to its members in complicating Putin's
cost-benefit assessment should be applauded.

Last week's NATO-Russia Council meeting showcased an Alliance working in
lockstep and finding political consensus in responding to preposterous
Russian demands[. NATO should always strive for this degree of
consensus]{.underline}. But if and when this crisis intensifies, and
Putin advances further into Ukraine, expectations for NATO assistance
will be raised, decisions about how to respond will become more
difficult, and consensus will be more elusive.

[Despite the rhetoric we might hear in response, this is not evidence of
NATO's ineffectiveness---but rather a **reflection of how democratic
institutions function**]{.underline}. And even absent consensus, NATO
can still contribute invaluably to Ukraine's sovereignty.

#### NATO remains a uniquely valuable institution to the US---influence and capacity to foster coop is unmatched

A year after Donald Trump's election to the presidency, the furor around
his approach to transatlantic security has predictably calmed. Part of
the reason is saturation. Like antibiotics, provocation of one's allies
loses its potency when used excessively. Part of the reason is that the
president has found a more willing and compelling foil, in the form of
Kim Jong Un, than those buttoned-up European leaders he accuses of
freeloading. Certainly, part of the reason includes the administration's
Russia-related scandals and Robert Mueller's investigation. The
president's hostility toward NATO has always felt more like a sop to
Moscow than a matter of principle and thus not a good look with
indictments swirling.

But much of it has to do with the nature of the alliance itself. [NATO's
**bread and butter is cooperation** on activities like planning,
doctrine, interoperability, and logistics]{.underline} --- things which
are uninteresting to the general public discourse and largely resistant
to the rhetorical or policy whims of even the president of the United
States. [Cooperation in these areas]{.underline}, while camouflaged to
all but the most intense NATO watchers, [can move the needle to the
benefit of the United States in concrete and practical
ways]{.underline}. As Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis heads to Brussels
for his third meeting of NATO defense ministers in ten months, it is
precisely to ensure such work continues.

Perception Is Not Policy

If it is fair to stipulate, without a hint of irony or partisanship,
that the president makes decisions based on a rather shallow
understanding of the pertinent facts, then his initial posture towards
NATO and Russia makes sense. In fact, as someone who watched an episode
or two of The Apprentice, Trump's embrace of Russia was predictable.
Equipped with a disposition that necessarily invites competition between
opposing factions, nerdy NATO with its committees and communiques never
had a chance against a tiger-hunting former KGB agent who invades
countries with impunity and without a shirt. Putin is ready-made
television.

Yet, as others have ably pointed out, viewed through the lens of genuine
policy, Trump's complaints about European security and its key players
have some basis in fact. And while it is tempting for policy
professionals like me to seek some novel, far-reaching meaning from the
impolitic veneer of his tweets and applause lines, the most remarkable
thing about Trump's censure of NATO is how quotidian it is as a matter
of policy. Questions about NATO's obsolescence date from at least the
1960s and have been a proverbial albatross for the alliance since the
end of the Cold War. That the United States is over-invested in NATO
relative to the Europeans and Canada is an acknowledged fact by nearly
everyone working transatlantic issues. And while I grimaced at the
graceless pluck of invoicing Angela Merkel for Germany's pedestrian
defense spending, if true, it was a gambit rooted in cause.

Even in tone, Trump's complaints alternately echo Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld's grouchy demonization of "Old Europe" in 2003 and Secretary
Robert Gates' headmasterly admonition of European defense spending in
2011. Similarly, Trump's flattery of Putin shares policy fingerprints
with both President George W. Bush's plumbing of the Russian leader's
soul and President Barack Obama's unfulfilling reset, even if the "Pale
Moth's" growing rap sheet since those halcyon times makes the recent
spectacle hard to stomach.

What is unique about the Trump era is the juxtaposition of his views on
the allies and Russia. The natural correlation is something akin to the
Cold War and Obama's second term: The United States is harmonious with
NATO and frosty with Moscow. Disagreements with France and Germany about
the 2003 invasion of Iraq occasioned another possibility whereby the
United States is at cross-purposes with both sides. Obama's first term
was characterized by a Medvedev-inspired bonhomie with Moscow that was
palatable as long as relations with the allies were equally durable.
Trump has introduced the final option: threatening estrangement with
traditional allies while currying favor with a Russia clearly hostile to
U.S. interests. It is this dynamic, among others, that is most
responsible for the disconsolation of America's foreign policy elite.

Yet this unusual state of affairs is more histrionics than a deliberate
policy course correction. [Even holding out the quixotic possibility
that Putin is willing and able to support some of Trump's foreign policy
goals (or, heaven forbid, electoral aspirations), there is no reason
this should come at the expense of cordial relations with the
Europeans]{.underline}. Unless, the logic goes, that is the price of
Russia's help, or more sinisterly, that Putin can otherwise manipulate
Trump's actions. The former requires malice aforethought inconsistent
with most evidence about how the president operates. The chances of the
latter, however implausible, are non-zero, and should Mueller find hard
evidence to suggest anything of the sort, we would find ourselves in a
scandal so serious as to make these matters quaint. In any case, the
Congress, a substantial portion of American public, and Trump's
post-Flynn national security officials have all resisted any quid pro
quo with Moscow that undercuts our allies. Which leads me to the
conclusion that Trump's enigmatic stance toward NATO and Russia is
unlikely to change unqualified American support for the alliance, even
when his public actions suggest otherwise. That Mattis and Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson have attended regular ministerial meetings, that
NATO's secretary general has visited the White House, and that Trump
himself has shuffled off to Brussels like his predecessors before him
lends credence to the theory that practical cooperation with the
alliance continues apace --- in ways often directly in conflict with
Russian interests.

Vapid, Vexing, Valuable

As a young Pentagon staffer, I was seconded to Brussels for a few months
in 2003 to work at the U.S. Mission to NATO. Naturally excited and
looking to make a positive impression, I rushed to backbench a NATO
committee meeting at the first opportunity. The topic, I vaguely recall,
was related to NATO capability development. I remember the imposing
conference room, the translation booths, the flags, and the bevy of
well-tailored colleagues from around Europe. I can still conjure the
anxious pride of sitting behind the placard stamped "United States" for
the first time. This was a dream. About 20 minutes later, it literally
became one. I had to repeatedly stab myself in the leg with a pen in
order to prod my jet-lagged body into consciousness. I could not have
imagined, until that moment, how detailed and dull the daily discourse
of NATO often is. And lest you are unconvinced by this reminiscence, I
highlight a former secretary of defense's habit of doing crossword
puzzles during NATO meetings or the Weekend at Bernie's jokes, prominent
among senior Obama officials in the Pentagon intended as a metaphor for
an alliance seen as moribund.

Moreover, NATO, like any large institution (hello Pentagon!), is raft
with dysfunction and internal contradictions. My particular hobby horse
is NATO's requirement for defense spending. Not that, infamously, only a
handful of members will ever meet the 2 percent of GDP target, but that
in spite of this obvious reality, NATO continues to promote the 2
percent goal as one of its core principles. In high school, I worked
summers at a drugstore where the staff would take turns getting lunch
for the group. One weekend, I arrived at the chosen spot, order in hand,
to be told that because of a delivery issue, the establishment was not
serving beef. Incredulous, I proclaimed, "but you're Burger King." I
likewise imagine a generation of earnest transatlantic scholars staring
at their textbooks, perplexed and mumbling, "but you're the 2 percent
people." To brand your organization with a characteristic that it will
never realize takes a chutzpah that Trump can appreciate, but is
nonetheless marketing malpractice of the first order. Compounding this
folly, Greece, whose military is antiquated, bloated, and oriented
toward conflict with another NATO ally, is championed alongside the
formidable militaries of the United States and the United Kingdom
because it meets the 2 percent threshold. NATO crediting Greece for its
military spending is tantamount to House Stark thanking House Frey for
hosting the Red Wedding. There are better ideas out there.

Nevertheless, I come here to praise NATO, not to bury it. [I detail the
aforementioned grievances to assure anyone reading this that those of us
experienced in the alliance's mysterious arts are not ignorant of its
problems]{.underline}. Much of our work, over many years, has been
dedicated to fixing or mitigating them. And [that same experience allows
us to appreciate the benefits that NATO membership accrues to the United
States]{.underline}. The cynical nature of our times and politics makes
it easy to criticize an organization like NATO, whose day-to-day work
does not translate readily to the masses. Even so, to have well-founded
frustrations with an elaborate and esoteric bureaucracy is one thing.
[To conclude such an organization is unworthy of American participation
or investment is another. Such a posture is at best impetuous and at
worst antithetical to the cause of "America First" that NATO naysayers
are intent on restoring.]{.underline}

[At its core, NATO is a **culture of intensive,**]{.underline} banal
**[cooperation]{.underline}**. It is a swanky headquarters building with
Euro-looking conference rooms and passable coffee where mundane meeting
after mundane meeting takes place on logistics, standardization, and
capability development. It is command centers and watch floors and
training areas where alliance militaries practice the monotonous
regimens so critical to the science of arms. It is the Alliance Command
Transformation --- A.K.A. the really boring part of [NATO --- where the
agonizing particulars of interoperability and doctrine are worked
out]{.underline}. It is the operational realization of the inane
political aspiration to cram soldiers from 14 different nations into a
single brigade. [It is a collection of customs and habits that dictate
how decisions will be made when the balloon goes up.]{.underline} It
prescribes where to meet and the rules for discussion. It ensures that
you can trust the colleague next to you because you've worked with her
in such a setting a hundred times before. [It structures discourse and
operations such that, by ritualizing behaviors and in making a thousand
minor decisions, you **build the blocks of strategic dexterity** that
NATO sometimes demonstrates.]{.underline}

The most poignant example I can point to of NATO's potential is its
mission [in Afghanistan]{.underline}. Over 15 years, and two distinct
American administrations[, the United States, through this tool called
NATO, coaxed more than a quarter of the world's countries to participate
in a far-flung and elusive mission that had nearly nothing to do with
their own national interests.]{.underline} That political feat, however,
is [rivaled by the operational one, where NATO allies and partners
sustained overlapping security, capacity-building, and
counter-insurgency missions across an enormous geographical expanse for
nearly a decade and a half.]{.underline} The complexity of military
operations is often undersold to the public in popular characterizations
of war, not to say anything about war by a coalition of militaries
measurably different in size, capability, and aptitude. That something
the scope, scale, and duration of the International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF) was ever realized is rather breathtaking. We could, and
should, argue about the strategic success of ISAF, and the costs, and
whether it would have been easier operationally had United States gone
it alone, but those are different debates. To appreciate ISAF is to
recognize the nameless technocrats and servicemen who, through muted
craftsmanship, navigated cranky parliaments and inordinate logistical
puzzles to achieve a political and operational tour de force. [This NATO
--- obscured to the public and the politicians that charge it with
obsolescence --- **substantiates a faith in the power of
process**]{.underline} that would make Sam Hinkie smile.

Fashionably Old-Fashioned

Ask some Middle East or Asian security experts about NATO and they
inevitably roll their eyes. That old thing. But have a deeper
conversation about how they are going about defense cooperation in their
regions and you quickly recognize what they want, however impractical,
is NATO in all its blessed, bureaucratic glory. Like vegetables to a
child, [**NATO is** never what you want, but usually **what you need**.
If you are a purveyor of soft power, NATO should be your thing. Where
else can you force common purpose and consensus on scores of dissimilar
nations by wont of incessant badgering]{.underline} (i.e., pretty much
the job of American officials at NATO[)? If you are a hard-power type, I
remind you again of ISAF and the fact of 52 militaries operating with
solidarity]{.underline} to impose their martial will. In either case,
you begin to understand Vladimir Putin's hostility toward the alliance
--- of what it is and what it could be should it ever have occasion to
turn its withering gaze to Moscow. [Is Putin's disdain not proof itself
of NATO's indomitable relevance and potency?]{.underline}

Ultimately, I suspect [Putin's paranoia is both about the methodical
reach of alliance hard power into his perceived sphere of influence as
well as the fact that that alliance nations]{.underline}, on the whole,
[aspire to live in a world defined by classic liberal
values]{.underline}. Putin begrudges not only NATO's endurance and
adaptability, but the goody-two-shoes Western order it represents. He
certainly delights in Trump's anti-liberal tendencies and hopes they
will weaken NATO, but recognizes they are unlikely to change its
deep-rooted puritan culture. To wit, consider again the 2 percent issue.
In a world obsessed with image and status, any number of European
defense officials fight to maintain the target because it is useful for
keeping pressure on their own parliaments and politicians for increased
defense spending. That is, the alliance chooses to look impotent in an
attempt to do the right thing rather than revise its blueprint to look
better. NATO, bless its heart.

So yes, NATO has its problems. The United States pays too much in
financial, human, and intellectual resources. On many days,
participating in alliance business is an exercise in herding cats, where
the United States, for all its trouble, gets to listen to countries with
militaries smaller than the office of a Pentagon undersecretary regale
everyone with their views on defense planning. Yet, [every previous
administration has concluded the benefits of NATO for the United States
outweigh these costs --- that the potential **NATO** has]{.underline},
and at times, realizes, [**is too valuable to our security to go
without**.]{.underline} Recognizing that NATO's costs are taxpayer
funded, Rumsfeld, Gates, and all of us should demand more of alliance
members and partners. However, we should not let a sense of grievance
confuse our understanding about NATO's value to U.S. interests --- of
the benefits that accrue from the yeoman's work of professionalizing the
world's militaries and security institutions such that they can work
competently with Washington to promote American interests. I doubt
whether the president can upend this calculus, even if that were his
conscious intention. Instead, I imagine the president as a sort of
Erlich Bachman whose bravado and opportunism occasionally prove a useful
spur to Mattis' driven and visionary Richard Hendricks and Tillerson's
Big Head. That should be enough for NATO to publicly navigate the Trump
era while practical cooperation grinds on systematically beneath the
surface.

#### Interconnectivity of cyberspace means NATO cyber response must be from the institution as a whole

[NATO'S CYBER DIMENSION]{.underline} Digital communications are the
backbone of society and, whilst they are a capability that NATO exploits
for operational and administrative advantage, it is neither an
environment that NATO, nor its Member States, can claim to control. The
ability to collect, process and deliver vast amounts of data requires
huge increases in military and bureaucratic efficiency. At the same
time[, all NATO nations need to work with the fact that their
**dependence on cyberspace**]{.underline}, including the internet, [**is
a major vulnerability** and, unless invested in, will result in
deteriorated overall resilience]{.underline}.571 [NATO,]{.underline} the
armed forces, International Organisations (IOs) and Non-Governmental
Organisations (NGOs) that work with it [expose themselves to known and
unknown risks while operating in the digital domain]{.underline}.
[Business as usual]{.underline} for NATO [includes the procurement and
organisation of military capabilities, engaging in the political
processes that support the **operation and coherence**]{.underline} of
the North Atlantic Council, [and the administration and control of the
NATO command elements]{.underline} and forces assigned to NATO
activities. It is a [huge undertaking with operational, logistic,
economic, political, technical, environmental and reputational
risks.]{.underline}

[The Alliance is inextricably linked to the digital domain and is faced
with many threats]{.underline} that create problems [for Member States
since cyberspace is international by nature. The **interconnectivity
makes a weakness of one country a weakness in all,** which means that
states and organisations **cannot deal effectively with cyber threats on
their own**.]{.underline}

### Active defense good

#### Active defense via OCOs better than current cyber deterrence\-- necessary to stop attacks before they happen

**Sulmeyer 18** (Michael Sulmeyer, Michael Sulmeyer is Director of the
Cyber Security Project at the Harvard Kennedy School\'s Belfer Center.
He previously served as Director for Plans and Operations for Cyber
Policy in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, "How the U.S. Can Play
Cyber-Offense: Deterrence Isn't Enough,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2018-03-22/how-us-can-play-cyber-offense)\--
LH

The [United States has been the victim of repeated cyberattacks by
foreign powers, and it seems to have little power to stop
them]{.underline}. During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Russian
hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee's e-mail servers
and made more general efforts to influence the election's outcome, as
detailed in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's indictment of 13 Russians
and three Russian entities. In February, U.S. intelligence and law
enforcement officials warned that the Russian government would again try
to use cyber-operations to interfere with midterm elections in November.
That same month, the White House publicly blamed Russia for "the most
destructive and costly cyberattack in history," the 2017 NotPetya
malware campaign, which crippled the government of Ukraine before
spreading to multinational corporations such as FedEx and Maersk,
causing billions in damage.

The [Russians are not the only ones hacking at the United States'
expense. Chinese hacking groups have stolen U.S. intellectual
property]{.underline} from industrial manufacturers and military
contractors. In 2015, China weaponized its "Great Firewall" and
conducted distributed denial of service attacks against U.S. websites,
including GitHub, which Beijing wished to punish for hosting content
that the Chinese leadership found undesirable. In 2014, [North Korean
hackers attacked the U.S. film studio Sony Pictures]{.underline} to
block the release of a movie, The Interview, that depicted the attempted
assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The attack erased the
content of thousands of computers, released embarrassing internal
e-mails, and intimidated Sony into canceling the movie's theatrical
release. [Iran too has lashed out in cyberspace, attacking U.S.
financial institutions and a dam]{.underline} in New York.

These [threats have led to renewed calls for cyber-deterrence measures
that would impose greater costs on would-be hackers while denying them
benefits]{.underline}. The administration of President Donald Trump, for
instance, has elevated U.S. Cyber Command to a unified combatant
command, which it believes will signal greater capability and resolve.
Deterrence is also likely behind the Trump administration's broad
declaratory policy in its Nuclear Posture Review, which contemplates the
use of nuclear weapons to deter non-nuclear threats. Former President
Barack Obama prioritized cyber-deterrence as well, including in his
administration's 2015 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy and in his
Justice Department's efforts to indict Chinese and Iranian hackers.

This [focus on cyber-**deterrence is understandable but misplaced**.
Deterrence aims to change the calculations of adversaries by persuading
them that the risks of an attack outweigh the rewards or that they will
be denied the benefits]{.underline} they seek. [But in seeking merely to
deter enemies, the United States finds itself constantly on the back
foot. Instead, **the United States should be pursuing a more active
cyberpolicy,** one aimed not at deterring enemies but at disrupting
their capabilities]{.underline}. In cyberwarfare, [Washington should
recognize **that the best defense is a good offense.**]{.underline}

THE PROBLEMS WITH DETERRENCE

There are [three main problems with U.S. efforts at
cyber-deterrence]{.underline}. The first is that [Washington is trying
to use a cold war strategy to address a twenty-first-century
problem]{.underline}. History teaches that deterrence kept the Cold War
cold: the United States and the Soviet Union were each vulnerable to the
other's thousands of nuclear weapons. When it comes to cyberspace,
however, the [United States has more to lose than its adversaries
because it has gone further in embracing innovation and connectivity
without security]{.underline}. But although the societies and
infrastructure of Washington's adversaries are less connected and
vulnerable than those of the United States, their methods of hacking can
still be disrupted.

Second[, it is difficult to convince foreign leaders (and foreign
hackers) that the costs of hacking really do outweigh the
benefits]{.underline}. Deterrence is all about perception: does an actor
believe that the threat of punishment is real enough to prevent him from
acting? This is as much a question of psychology as one of national
security strategy. Many U.S. adversaries are less vulnerable in
cyberspace than the United States is, so meaningful [punishment would
require discerning their priorities]{.underline} (for instance, money or
public reputation) [and threatening concerted action against
them.]{.underline} Yet gaining clarity about foreign leaders'
priorities---and credibly threatening them---is easier said than done:
during the Cold War, Soviet leaders often misunderstood signals from
their U.S. counterparts, as when they interpreted the NATO military
exercise Able Archer 83 as a prelude to war. Not much has
changed---National Security Agency Director Admiral Michael Rogers
acknowledged during a recent hearing that the Russians "haven't paid a
price . . . that's sufficient to get them to change their behavior."

Third, [it is virtually impossible to know if deterrence is
working]{.underline}. The goal is to prevent attacks. But if no attacks
occur, it is hard to determine why---perhaps the would-be attacker was
deterred by the threat of punishment; perhaps the attack failed for some
other reason. Washington should not base its national cyberpolicy on a
strategy whose success, almost by definition, cannot be evaluated,
especially if there are good alternatives available.

[Today's fight in cyberspace occurs in **the gray zone between war and
peace**. If the United States hopes to win, it should spend]{.underline}
less time trying to persuade its competitors that it is not worth
hacking and more [time preempting them and degrading their ability to do
so. It is time to target capabilities]{.underline}, not calculations.

**[HACK THE HACKER]{.underline}**

How could the United States begin degrading its opponents' ability to
hack? Washington's actions need not always be aggressive or destructive.
In countries where technology companies are willing to cooperate with
the U.S. government (or with requests from their own government), a
phone call to the right cloud provider or Internet service provider
(ISP) could result in getting bad actors kicked off the Internet. This
is not a permanent solution, but it will force adversaries to rebuild,
which often prompts unforced errors, making them more vulnerable to U.S.
surveillance and disruption.

If subtle measures prove insufficient, [the United States should be
ready to take more offensive action.]{.underline} In situations where
the defense of the nation is on the line, U.S. hackers could pursue a
campaign of erasing computers at scale, disabling accounts and
credentials used by hackers to attack, and cutting off access to
services so it is harder to compromise innocent systems to conduct their
attacks. [Such a campaign would aim to make every aspect of hacking much
harder:]{.underline} because hackers often reuse computers, accounts,
and infrastructure, targeting these would sabotage their capabilities or
render them otherwise useless.

Such actions need not send a message that hacking the United States
doesn't pay. Instead, [they should support a more limited but more
achievable objective: stop adversaries from hacking the United
States.]{.underline} Whether or not foreign leaders perceive that
cyberattacks on the United States are worth conducting, [Washington can
prevent them from doing so in the first place.]{.underline}

[**Offensive cyber-operations** should not be undertaken
lightly]{.underline}---the United States must bear in mind its
commitments under international law and its relationships with its
allies. But excessive caution cannot prevent Washington from defending
itself: with the United States' enemies already attacking it online,
[the country will need to be more proactive than it has been thus
far.]{.underline}

The U.S. government has already undertaken a few asymmetric, or
non-cyber, approaches to degrading its adversaries' abilities to hack
targets in the United States. It has sanctioned foreign individuals and
companies to limit their access to capital and resources. It has also
indicted some hackers from China, Iran, and Russia in the hope that
public exposure will make it more difficult for them to hack. These are
efforts worth pursuing, but not because they deter. Rather, like
offensive cyber-operations, they can degrade attackers' capabilities,
although only in indirect ways because they rely on the cooperation of
foreign governments.

DEFENSE AT SCALE

Even as it seeks to upgrade its offensive cyber-capabilities, the United
States should also be improving its defense. Best practices for
cybersecurity, such as more secure methods to authenticate users, are
increasingly well-known and easy to implement. The issue today is how to
improve cyberdefenses at scale. The only way to do so is for the
government to work with large technology companies to implement security
enhancements for everyday Internet use. Examples include rolling out
secure connections to websites, known as "https" (as opposed to the
unencrypted "http"), for everyone and increasing the use of physical
security tokens to improve the security of user credentials. Companies
that offer these services need not force every customer to use them, but
making greater security the default and allowing users to opt out rather
than opt in would go a long way toward increasing protection.

Cyberdefense needs to be a priority for many sectors of the technology
industry. Referring to the "private sector" as a monolith conflates the
capabilities and interests of different companies. Social media
companies are not ISPs, and cloud service providers are not content
delivery networks. Different kinds of companies can and should offer
different ways to improve the security of their clients. Doing more to
prevent malware from reaching U.S. homes and businesses, through
measures such as blocking attempted connections to known malicious
sites, can improve cybersecurity at scale without individual users
needing to take action.

Defense in cyberspace means more than just trying to keep the hackers
out of networks. It also means being resilient in the face of successful
cyberattacks. Resilience goes beyond backing up data. Companies must
also consider how to maintain continuity of their operations (not just
websites) in order to survive a cyberattack. North Korea's destructive
attack against Sony Pictures and Russia's indiscriminate use of the
NotPetya malware are harbingers of the future, and both public and
private entities should be prepared.

The time for technology companies across the board to improve the
security aspects of the products and services they offer is now. Larry
Kramer, the president of the Hewlett Foundation, recalled how other
industries handled this challenge historically: "If you go back to the
early 20th century of Rockefeller and Carnegie and Ford---who made their
fortunes in the industrial revolution---the titans of industry actually
dedicated their funding to deal with the downsides of what they had
wrought." He continued, "We haven't had that out of the tech industry
here. These are all problems generated by their creations." Those
companies assumed accountability then for their products; today's
technology companies need to assume more accountability for theirs.
Steps like these, in combination with the more muscular [offensive
strategy outlined above, will be far more effective than deterrence at
keeping the United States safe in cyberspace]{.underline}.

The conservative case for NATO is not that it strengthens liberal world

Now consider the alternative. **[[American withdrawal from NATO would be

surrender the above advantages and [undo]{.mark} existing [progress in

mention the obvious and [immediate]{.mark} tactical and operational
[military advantages]{.mark} that would accrue [to Russia in Europe,
shifting the balance of power against the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}

The irony is that the Trump administration actually has a success story
to tell about its policies toward NATO and Russia, particularly in
Europe. Under this administration, [the [U.S.]{.mark} has [provided
lethal aid to Ukraine]{.mark} to fight off Russia]{.underline}n-backed
insurgents. It [has made no concessions to Moscow]{.underline} regarding
that conflict. [It has [increased sanctions against Russia]{.mark} and
[boosted America's military presence]{.mark} in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}. [It has increased funding to the European Defense
Initiative,]{.underline} bolstered U.S. defense spending, held Russia
accountable for its breach of the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty) Treaty, and explored the place of low-yield nuclear weapons as a
necessary component of the American arsenal to deter Russian aggression.
At the same time, the [president's calls for increased European defense
spending have had]{.underline} some useful [effects.]{.underline}
Virtually [**[all NATO allies]{.mark}** have [i**ncreased**
their]{.mark} levels of **[defense spending]{.mark}** over the past two
years.]{.underline} As president, Mr. Trump has regularly reiterated his
support for NATO. The concomitant [[emphasis on allied burden-sharing is
not unreasonable]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Eisenhower regularly insisted.

In keeping with its treaty powers under the U.S. Constitution, Congress
should not be passive on this issue. [Last week, a bipartisan group of
lawmakers introduced a bill to express continuing congressional support
for the NATO alliance.]{.underline} The bill passed by a vote of 357 to
22 in the House of Representatives. The [Senate is working on similar
legislation]{.underline}.

Public-opinion polls taken over the last three years show that a solid
majority of Trump supporters, conservatives, Republicans, and Americans
continue to back the NATO alliance. Conservative voters in heartland
states such as Wisconsin certainly expect Europeans to do their fair
share in defending themselves. But they do not oppose NATO. On the
contrary, they support it.

An overarching support for America's Western alliance has been a key
component in the conservative foreign-policy approach since Eisenhower's
time. It remains relevant to this day. As conservative Republicans and
other Americans consider the costs and benefits of the U.S. alliance
system, recall Ike's wise recommendation: "Now boys, let's not make our
mistakes in a hurry."

[China's challenges to US and European security constitute such common
threats]{.underline} across a broad range of sectors[. These include
gradual **reinterpretations** of principles **of international law,**
the **subversion of universal liberal market** economic practices, and
**cyber insurgencies** targeting a wide range of civilian and military
entities]{.underline}. These [Chinese policies all have major military
implications because they are related to]{.underline} developments in
[the operating principles, capabilities, and priorities of China's armed
forces**. Only NATO can offer an integrated transatlantic response** to
the military aspects of Chinese policies]{.underline} that threaten
those sectors across the globe, including European actors. [NATO's
involvement is essential if the credibility of the alliance's security
guarantees is to be preserved and an effective response to China's
encroachments on a liberal rules-based order]{.underline} is to be
established. The omnipresent character of the China threat demonstrates
that [it is long overdue for NATO to position itself as a significant
player]{.underline} in addressing Beijing's challenges to transatlantic
security. [NATO is key to keeping US and European security policies
coordinated when applying mechanisms of deterrence and defense against
Chinese challenges]{.underline}. If transatlantic unity of purpose is
lost, both the US and Europe are far less likely to succeed in
addressing China sufficiently.

#### NATO cohesion over cyber necessary to confront Russia-China threat

policy, Indo-Pacific security, and the geopolitics of the Arctic region.

Rather than highlighting the need for a division of labor within NATO,
the [2022 invasion has highlighted that **Russia's appetite** for
threatening Europe]{.underline} with military action [is closely
**entwined with its long-standing strategic cooperation with
China**.]{.underline} Intelligence reports that China told Russia in
February 2022 not to invade Ukraine before the end of the Winter
Olympics in Beijing testify to the closely orchestrated Chinese-Russian
approach to the West.18 [Moscow and Beijing are both strategic opponents
of the US,]{.underline} a shared status that has spurred them to
coordinate their separate geostrategic priorities in Europe and the
Indo-Pacific, forging unison pushback against what they consider Western
encroachments on their spheres of interest.19 The poorer than expected
performance of the Russian armed forces in its 2022 war with Ukraine has
pushed China to try to appear neutral. Nevertheless, China has joined
Russia in opposing further enlargement of NATO, and in the Indo-Pacific,
Russia has joined China in opposing Taiwanese independence.20 [It would
be wise for Europe and the US to plan for Sino-Russian geostrategic
coordination]{.underline} to continue unless more clear evidence that
China will abandon Russia is presented. [One thing is certain: China
will work with the partners that help it advance a **Sinocentric
international order based on authoritarian regimes**]{.underline}. And
to counter this development, [Europe and the United States need to
devise effective **mechanisms for joint responses** to Beijing as well
as to Moscow.]{.underline}

A US-European division of labor is not likely to help NATO develop tools
to defend itself against threats from China and Russia. The lack of
electronic warfare in Russia's war with Ukraine has revealed gaps
between its concept of operations and the tactics of the Ukrainian
military. As demonstrated in prior operations in Syria and the Donbas,
Russia will adapt and learn in the short and long term. For example,
Russia can be expected to improve its electromagnetic spectrum
management in order to enhance its planning and management of forces on
the battlefield. Meanwhile, [China is watching the performance of the
parties involved in the war with a view to update its cyber]{.underline}
and [space capabilities as well as strategic concepts]{.underline}. As a
consequence, both Russian and Chinese threats will continue to
increasingly emerge in the cyber and space domains. [This calls for
global and functional defenses rather than an exclusive geographical
focus. It is more important than ever to design NATO for a future where
threats toward transatlantic security are global and **requires a
unified response**.]{.underline}

[Even if the balance of forces between the United States and Europe is
asymmetrical, the **response to Chinese and Russian threats should be
joint**.]{.underline} In a perfect world, NATO would respond as it did
in 1966 when France filed for divorce: redefine the purpose of the
alliance by expanding it. In 1967, the Harmel report added to the
original purpose of defending member states with the management of
European security writ large.21 Ideally, in 2022 a similar exercise
would globalize NATO's purpose to encompass defending the transatlantic
member states against threats from China in all domains and across
geographic regions.22 However, since 1967, US security interests have
moved away from Europe and the post-Soviet sphere and put China and the
Indo-Pacific region at the top of the US list of priorities. Washington
is not likely to volunteer to spend time and resources renegotiating the
fundamental political and military transatlantic relationship. If NATO
took on a similar effort, it is likely to produce institutional
disintegration and paralysis.23 Instead, NATO must put existing
resources and mechanisms to good use to demonstrate its relevance for
addressing the China threat in all domains and in the Indo-Pacific. The
strategic question for NATO should not be whether, but how?

[**NATO cannot continue to stand by idly** while its member states are
redirecting their foreign and defense policies to take into account
Chinese encroachments on European security without losing credibility as
an adequate guarantor of transatlantic security]{.underline}. It is not
only the US that has turned its attention toward the Indo-Pacific; NATO
member states such as the UK and France, as well as the EU, are
recognized as significant contributors to Indo-Pacific security efforts
in the US Indo-Pacific strategy. The US encourages NATO to continue to
focus on committing more attention to the Indo-Pacific, an indication
that so far the alliance has been largely absent from security
initiatives in the region.24 NATO invariably goes unmentioned when
deterrence of China is on the security agenda of major powers. Engaging
NATO in US and European naval diplomacy would allow NATO visibility on
China issues, but it would also meet with insurmountable resistance from
significant US partners in the Indo-Pacific, such as France and Germany.
If European or US vessels and aircraft were to fly the NATO flag when
participating in freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea
to counter China's claims to historic waters and demands for prior
notification of military vessels, Beijing is likely to respond in line
with its current position of issuing warnings and pursuing such military
vessels.25 The fact that relaxed prospective responses from Beijing seem
highly plausible diagnoses the problem: NATO is no longer a cause for
concern for [China, who does not believe the alliance can agree on a
collective transatlantic response to Beijing's security
challenges.]{.underline}

Although NATO visibility may be desirable, it may also not be the best
place to start working on increasing the alliance's role in getting into
the game of deterrence of China. French and German resistance toward
allowing NATO to play a role in the Indo-Pacific far from the European
continent stems from entrapment concerns. Such resistance to the
alliance's involvement indicates that [NATO has to prove capable of
combining US and European views on how to deal with China
threats]{.underline} without increasing the entrapment potential in the
eyes of key European allies.

#### **[Cyber]{.underline}** and space [**is a promising arena for NATO to address** China challenges by building member state resilience]{.underline}. Like the air and sea domains, as areas that belong to no one state and which provide access to much of the globe, they form part of the global commons. Command of the commons has been the key enabler of the US global position of power for many decades.26 However, China wields a sufficient range of sea, air, cyber, and space capabilities such that the global commons is now a contested zone. In contrast to the sea and air domains, cyber and space are sparsely regulated. This [**lack of international norms enhances the risk of conflict** based on misperception, making **NATO cooperation pertinent**. Adversarial activities toward the US and Europe in the cyber and space domain threaten transatlantic security. These come not just from China, but also from other adversaries such as Russia and Iran]{.underline}. Mechanisms for addressing these challenges in the military sector are essentially generic and not, at least in their basic design, established with a particular country in mind. Thus, cyber and space provide an avenue for NATO to contribute significantly to deterrence of China without having to combat major internal resistance. NATO would also benefit from long-standing US-EU cooperation on cyber and space issues.27 Chinese-Western hybrid war is [accelerated]{.underline} by cyber warfare -- [extinction]{.underline} {#cyber-and-space-is-a-promising-arena-for-nato-to-address-china-challenges-by-building-member-state-resilience.-like-the-air-and-sea-domains-as-areas-that-belong-to-no-one-state-and-which-provide-access-to-much-of-the-globe-they-form-part-of-the-global-commons.-command-of-the-commons-has-been-the-key-enabler-of-the-us-global-position-of-power-for-many-decades.26-however-china-wields-a-sufficient-range-of-sea-air-cyber-and-space-capabilities-such-that-the-global-commons-is-now-a-contested-zone.-in-contrast-to-the-sea-and-air-domains-cyber-and-space-are-sparsely-regulated.-this-lack-of-international-norms-enhances-the-risk-of-conflict-based-on-misperception-making-nato-cooperation-pertinent.-adversarial-activities-toward-the-us-and-europe-in-the-cyber-and-space-domain-threaten-transatlantic-security.-these-come-not-just-from-china-but-also-from-other-adversaries-such-as-russia-and-iran.-mechanisms-for-addressing-these-challenges-in-the-military-sector-are-essentially-generic-and-not-at-least-in-their-basic-design-established-with-a-particular-country-in-mind.-thus-cyber-and-space-provide-an-avenue-for-nato-to-contribute-significantly-to-deterrence-of-china-without-having-to-combat-major-internal-resistance.-nato-would-also-benefit-from-long-standing-us-eu-cooperation-on-cyber-and-space-issues.27-chinese-western-hybrid-war-is-accelerated-by-cyber-warfare-extinction .Analytic}

Imagine if Pearl Harbor had been attacked and there had been no response
from Washington.

This is the actual case today due to a highly sophisticated, mature, and
stealth strategy perpetrated against the United States (US) by advanced
nation-state military methods leveled at every sector and organization
in our society. This includes private sector businesses, all government
agencies, the military, and academia - every US organization operating
with innovation, intellectual property, or sensitive data. The world is
in significant conflict requiring the private sector, US government, and
military to deliberately confront this national crisis or become
permanently irrelevant. It is no longer "business as usual."

[Over the past three decades]{.underline}, as the US military trained in
conventional, nuclear, and counterinsurgency warfare[, the Chinese
Communist Party [(CCP]{.mark}) engaged and
[perfected]{.mark}]{.underline} over forty methods of [[warfare intended
to permanently destabilize]{.mark} and weaken [the US]{.mark} both
economically and militarily]{.underline}. At the same time, [China
rapidly grew its economy and military without the required time or
investment in innovation]{.underline}. The result is that the US is
hemorrhaging its economic strength and relevance at the rate of \$5
trillion in lost total value each year, or one-third of the U.S. Gross
Domestic Product (GDP).

General (Ret.) Keith Alexander, former [Director of the National
Security Agency (NSA) and Commander of US Cyber Command, referred to
[**China's theft of American innovation** and i]{.mark}ntellectual
[p]{.mark}roperty [as "the **greatest transfer of wealth**]{.mark} in
history."]{.underline}

Over time, a [weakened [US]{.mark} economy directly reduces the strength
and effectiveness of the US military]{.underline}. Further, [when a
country is manipulated by an adversary]{.underline} to lose one-third of
the value of its economy each year, **[it [is at
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What does this mean for US citizens? A
cumulative and shocking permanent reduction in quality of life to those
organizations that \"don\'t know what they don\'t know.\"

Asymmetrical Hybrid Warfare

**[[Clear and Present Existential Threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Over the past thirty years, the [US government and private sector have
advanced their policy of full-cooperation]{.underline}, including
substantial financial and technological investment in China, [under the
belief that they were moving towards a more democratic]{.underline},
free-market [society]{.underline} while China played intentional
misdirection and deception. In 1986, month number three, the [Communist
Party of China ([CCP)]{.mark} officially [declared Asymmetrical Hybrid
Warfare]{.mark} (AHW) [against the US and]{.mark} **its [western
allies]{.mark}**]{.underline} in its nation-state Program 863.
[[This]{.mark} strategy [commits]{.mark} all of
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} with its strict Communist military rule [[to
engage in any]{.mark} and all [methods to]{.mark} become on par with,
surpass, [and dominate the West at **any**]{.mark} **and all
[cost]{.mark}**.]{.underline} China's ultimate objective is to harvest
and perpetuate the Chinese Dream through the extraction and
extinguishing of the American Dream, the American way of life and ending
Western dominance. The Chinese strategy is that a er 200 years of
Western global dominance, it is their destiny to reverse roles with the
US and to relegate it to a forced supplier with a much lower quality of
life. To underscore this strategy, China refers to the last century as
"the century of great humiliation." It must also be emphasized that [AHW
[strategy is rooted in **Unrestricted Warfare**]{.mark} or "war without
rules."]{.underline}

Death by a Thousand Cuts

The Modern Battlefield is Everywhere

AHW has been established as the future of modern warfare and business
strategy across the globe. It is ultimate warfare that has many forms:
economic warfare, transaction warfare, industrial warfare, drug warfare,
and propaganda warfare, to name only a few. Each method is characterized
by the non-utilization of military or conventional warfare that is
typical of aircraft, ships, troops, and weapons. While China continues
to aggressively develop and expand its military, it does so with the
belief that if it must resort to the use of conventional or nuclear
warfare, it has ultimately failed at achieving the enemy's capitulation
through the combined methods of AHW. In the business sector, AHW has
become the "New Global Competitive Model" where the "winner takes all."
Soon, China will dictate transactions and pricing based on its market
dominance. As businesses rush to move to "digital transformation" and
"Big Data," each must perform a 180° cybersecurity transformation based
on sensitive data protection and adversarial motives as a means to
survive. Currently, AHW is the primary focus of our adversaries: China
is, by far, the most successful at methodically executing all AHW
methods, while Russia, North Korea, Iran, and India engage in relatively
few methods at present. The strategy is to continuously inflict damage
or cuts to every facet of American society just below the pain threshold
where we choose not to act. We believe that China has achieved an
estimated 750 cuts towards "death by a thousand cuts." (Sun Tzu)

Definition

AHW is characterized as unconventional, non-military, multi-method
strategic warfare based on deception and void of any rules between
countries where economic and military power, strategy and tactics differ
significantly. The attacking country exploits inherent weaknesses
through numerous uneven and seemingly unrelated AHW methods that are
designed to destabilize the unwitting target country for ultimate and
complete economic and military submission. Extensive use of
misinformation and plausible deniability are used to deceive and deflect
suspicion of the strategy or its methodical advancement. Hybrid warfare
is a military strategy that blends conventional warfare, asymmetric
warfare, irregular warfare, offset warfare, non-linear warfare, and
cyber warfare. AHW is rooted in unrestricted warfare (war without rules
where "everything is fair play") which is also described as "anything
warfare." Source: BLACKOPS Partners Corporation

Culture Disparity as a Strategic Weapon

It is important to note the striking contrast between the two cultures
of the US and Communist China. It is this great divide that has
contributed to China's manipulation and acceleration of AHW against the
US. The CCP believes its "legalism" philosophy of supreme law and people
are superior to America's constitutional democracy underpinned by
justice, religion, a Creator, and "all men are created equal." Since
1949, the CCP have controlled all aspects of China's commerce, military,
and daily life where intellectual property is state-owned, all data is
controlled, and it is the national duty of all citizens to support the
regime, including all aspects of espionage. The Communist culture is
further defined not by "winning vs. losing"; rather, "living vs. dying."
It is this extreme belief that underscores China's support for AHW in
its conflict with the US. Another distinction is that the CCP controls
every business transaction with US companies. In many cases, the CCP
resembles a powerful organized crime faction, through its shell business
partnerships and facades. There is no distinction between China's
organized crime, military, or government. This places every US business
partnership or transaction with China at extreme risk.

Critical Role of Intelligence

[China's [uncompromising commitment]{.mark} to AHW [demonstrates a
national objective to destroy the]{.mark} US and its [West]{.mark}ern
allies.]{.underline} The [critical nucleus that drives the AHW strategy
is the [complete dependence on stolen innovation]{.mark}, intellectual
property **([IP), sensitive data]{.mark},** and military secrets -
namely **[intelligence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For over thirty years,
China has orchestrated the most impressive and sophisticated strategy
with an intricate global network of espionage and industrial the to fuel
AHW. In recent years, an emboldened China has demanded the complete
surrender of all intellectual property during the process of contracting
current international business transactions. Conversely[**,
[intelligence]{.mark}** [plays a critical role]{.mark} for the US **[to
gauge the]{.mark} executional [success]{.mark}** [of AHW]{.mark},
changes in strategy, and individual and cumulative damages.]{.underline}

**[Cyber Warfare as the Key Accelerator]{.underline}**

[[China]{.mark} has successfully [intertwined Cyber warfare as **the
key**]{.mark} **AHW [accelerator]{.mark}** [due to]{.mark} its
relatively [minimal investmen]{.mark}t and the difficulty of attributing
actions to a specific actor]{.underline}. At the same time,
[[cybersecurity remains **fundamentally broken** in]{.mark} the US and
[the Wes]{.mark}t]{.underline} due to failed cyber strategies, lack of
awareness of AHW, lack of accountability, overconfidence, and
over-dependence on inherently fallible cybersecurity products[. This is
made clear by the "new normal" of the [increased trend
in]{.mark}]{.underline} number, frequency, and resulting total damages
from [[cyberattacks.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Current [estimates place [global cyber losses at \$6
trillion]{.mark}]{.underline} by 2021, with expectations that this will
increase further in the future, according to Cybersecurity Ventures.
[Cyber warfare]{.underline} and cybersecurity have become a "whole of
society" challenge that [requires a unified, elevated
strategy]{.underline} and 180° approach to combat the morphing threat.
As we examine today's cybersecurity environment, we are looking through
the wrong end of the telescope. It is only in the context of AHW that we
can begin to fully understand cybersecurity's critical role for
successful defense, protection, and resolution. We have learned to treat
cybersecurity first and foremost as a human problem and a senior
leadership challenge, not solely an IT issue.

The [space domain has]{.underline} recently [become a new field full of
new opportunities due to the advancements in technology.]{.underline}
Nevertheless, [vulnerabilities may arise as states and private companies
exploit this domain to achieve **strategic competitive
advantage**]{.underline} in different areas ([e.g. weather monitoring,
transport, environment and agriculture, science,
communications,]{.underline} among others), and draw benefits out of
them. These [realities may pose challenges to the **existing rule of
law** in the space domain leading to legal uncertainty and
a]{.underline}n apparent [governance vacuum]{.underline}. In addition,
[possible technological disruptions (e.g. satellites' interferences) may
**distort information gathered**]{.underline}, [which is **essential for
NATO's operations** and missions, including collective defence, crisis
response and counter-terrorism.]{.underline}

Hence, these concerns have resulted in NATO's new space policy, and in
this way recognizing space as new operational domain two years ago.4 The
1980s and 1990s bore witness [that concluding new binding agreements for
outer space matters beyond the existing ones would be extremely
difficult.]{.underline} However, the fluid legal regime for the outer
space does not entail that customary international law is inapplicable.5
The crystallization of an international customary norm is a lengthy
process, as is the development of treaties, and thus the introduction of
a Rules-Based International Order (RBIO). Several factors within [the
space domain **cannot be under-estimated** by the Alliance such as
space-based strike weapons, space support for the Alliance's operations
or dual-use material/devices.]{.underline}

[These challenges emphasize the need to complete policy and doctrine to
achieve **better interoperability and resilience** among
Allies]{.underline} and contribute to forge a network of reliable soft
law. [NATO's inclusion of space as the fifth operational domain
represents a step forward in]{.underline} support of the principles of
the Charter of the United Nations and on [NATO's pathos of]{.underline}
collective self-defence and consultation, as enshrined in [articles 4
(consultation)]{.underline} and 5 (collective defence) of the Washington
Treaty. Hence, [such inclusion is an additional feature of the
adaptability of these provisions to armed attacks]{.underline}
(including nonconventional tactics).6 Bearing in mind the Alliance's
institutionalized procedures and the behaviours observed over the past
years in formal and informal domains, including the space domain, hybrid
threats will continue proliferating at the left and the right of article
5.

Over the past few years, there has been a huge uptick in public
discourse about the "militarization of space"---a phrase that may sound
concerning, but it is also nothing new. Much of this discussion has been
driven by the founding of the United States Space Force and
reestablishment of the United States Space Command. Regardless of how
these moves may look to some, as someone who was a party to the
discussions surrounding these decisions, I can confidently say that they
were not taken lightly, nor were they aimed at establishing the United
States as the aggressor in the space domain. [The United States did
recently formally recognize space as a new warfighting
domain]{.underline}, but in order to understand why this happened it is
necessary to examine the history of warfare and human activity in the
space domain.

The Theory of War

As Clausewitz would remind us, "War is merely the continuation of policy
by other means." Simply put, war is an extension of politics. When
political leaders cannot achieve their objectives through peaceful
means, they turn to war as a means to a policy end. James Carafano
describes how this plays out across the various domains:

War is a competition between adversaries, a contest of action and
counteraction that concludes or changes based on the agency of
competitors, and this competition unfolds in the domains accessible to
each competitor: land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. Dominating in
war is not about dominating a domain. It is about dominating an enemy.

As technology has evolved over time, so too has our reach into new
domains---the surface and subsurface of the seas, the air, and now space
and cyberspace. In war, the goal is to force the enemy to accept terms
that favor the victor. As Clausewitz puts it, "War is thus an act of
force to compel our enemy to do our will"---and advancements in
technology have opened up new domains, like space and cyber, to enable
us to achieve those aims.

Smart practitioners of warfare seek to achieve victory by attacking
their enemy's perceived weaknesses. As Sun Tzu stated: "So in war, the
way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak."
Clausewitz later introduced the concept of centers of gravity, which are
the moral or physical strength of the combatants. Rather than directly
attacking this strength, as Dr. Joe Strange and Colonel Richard Iron
note, "experienced practitioners of the operational art aim to identify
the enemy's center of gravity and its critical vulnerabilities, then
concentrate superior combat power to exploit those critical
vulnerabilities, thereby forcing the enemy's culmination and so achieve
decisive success."

As we look to space and cyber as newly recognized domains of warfare, we
must remember these concepts apply to all human conflicts. War is a
contest of wills between human competitors, and historically these
contests take place wherever humans operate and interact.

[The History of the Space Domain]{.underline}

[Our modern space capabilities resulted from the evolution of Cold
War--era technology and the "space race."]{.underline} Given the
devastating effects of nuclear weapons at the end of World War II and
the development of those weapons by both the United States and the
Soviet Union as the two remaining superpowers at the end of the war, a
competition for technological superiority took shape between the two
nations. Out of this competition several arms races resulted to include
both a nuclear one and, closely behind, one in space. Enabled by
captured German scientists, like Wernher von Braun in the United States,
the development of each nation's rocket technology and, eventually,
intercontinental ballistic missiles---which allowed nuclear weapons to
be delivered over great distances with little warning---increased the
mistrust between the two nations. These technologies not only shaped the
Cold War, but were also essential to the development of each nation's
space program. After all, the technology required to place a warhead
with precision halfway around the world is foundational to the space
program as well, since both cases require rockets to achieve similar
altitudes and velocities.

When President Dwight D. Eisenhower developed the United States' first
space policy, he prioritized intelligence gathering to see into the
Soviet Union. While this was perhaps initially driven by the "Pearl
Harbor mentality" that resulted from senior leaders having experienced
the strategic surprise that brought the United States into World War II,
this need for intelligence was later underscored when Gary Powers's U-2
spy plane was shot down---and our ability to monitor the Soviet Union's
nuclear weapons program effectively ended. After the Soviet Union
launched its Sputnik satellite and established the first space norm of
free overflight in outer space, the United States launched the CORONA
program.

In addition to the development of intelligence capabilities, as the
United States and Soviet Union competed in the space domain, both
nations also attempted to build several space weapon systems. In the
1960s, the United States conducted the first high-altitude nuclear
detonation test, Starfish Prime, and the Soviet Union's fractional
orbital bombardment system sought to enable on-orbit nuclear bombing---a
concept that China's recent hypersonic test may be bringing closer to
reality. Later, the Soviet Union tested an orbiting aircraft cannon
onboard the Salyut-3 space station and the United States experimented
with on-orbit missile defense with its Brilliant Pebbles system and
launched its first direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon system, the
F-15's ASM-135. Eventually, other countries would build up their space
capabilities and follow suit, as China did when it tested an
anti-satellite missile by destroying its Fengyun-1C satellite in 2007.
While the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 sought to limit the development of
these orbital weapon systems, it only specifically bans nations from
placing weapons of mass destruction on orbit.

In 1998, the Rumsfeld Commission warned of a "Space Pearl Harbor" and
that attacks on the US space infrastructure would be likely during a
conflict scenario. In 2015 and 2016, US Strategic Command established
the National Space Defense Center (which was then known as the Joint
Interagency Combined Space Operations Center), under direction from
Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work to defend our space
architecture. In 2019 came the two moves that garnered the widest
attention. First, DoD reestablished US Space Command, reflecting the
fact that space had already become a warfighting domain, and that we
needed a combatant commander supported by all the services to protect
our assets in space. Second, in December 2019, the United States Space
Force was established as a separate service under the United States Air
Force in recognition of the importance of space as a warfighting domain
similar to the land, maritime, and air domains. While at the time, the
headlines may have made these moves seem aggressive, they must be viewed
through the decades of historical context that preceded them.

The Larger Context

Simply put, the [United States has excelled in modern warfare as a
direct result of our ability to leverage our space assets as **combat
multipliers.**]{.underline} During Operation Desert Storm, we were
effectively able to navigate through open desert thanks to the advent of
the Global Positioning System (GPS)---which was not even a fully
operational constellation at the time. Later, during Operation Iraqi
Freedom we demonstrated how much further we had advanced as we were able
to communicate over vast distances and strike targets leveraging
precision-guided munitions that were GPS enabled.

As American military forces demonstrated dominance on the modern
battlefield, adversaries took note and developed capabilities to take
those advantages away and level the playing field. The 2021 Space Threat
Assessment provides an overview of the categories of kinetic and
nonkinetic weapons being developed globally to reduce that advantage.
Because of the nature of warfare, and our demonstrated success on the
terrestrial battlefields, our adversaries continue the growth and
advancement of these weapon systems.

Given this uncertain world, with persistent and evolving threats from
Iran and North Korea and the renewal of great power competition among
the United States, Russia, and China, we as a nation must account for
the fact that our reliance on space, while in many ways a combat
multiplier, may also be perceived as a vulnerability. As we further
analyze our adversaries' objectives, we must be cognizant of those they
may be willing to accomplish through force if they are unable to achieve
them through peaceful means. We must also account for weapon systems
that can be used to create effects to and from each of the domains in
which humans operate---including space.

Returning to Clausewitz, however, generating effects (such as the
destruction of personnel and equipment) is not the end goal for warfare;
it is to achieve political objectives. The effects our enemies choose to
create, and where they choose to produce them, are designed to help them
efficiently achieve their wartime objectives. Striking the United States
where we appear to be weak, in any domain, is a natural element of
warfare that we must be prepared for.

Each time humans have ventured off land, first into the sea and later
into the air, we've brought conflict with us and leveraged those domains
to achieve victory. Warfare extends into all domains where humans
operate, because war is a contest of wills to achieve policy objectives
by force when peaceful methods are no longer considered to be a
reasonable means to a political end. Space is no exception, and it began
taking shape as a warfighting domain even before humans first managed to
reach it.

It is just now getting the recognition it has been lacking in the past
due to the recent successful demonstration of destructive space
technologies that have been in development from the very beginning of
our foray into the space domain. Given that recognition, we must prepare
to defend our vital national interests in this domain and develop our
thinking and communication about warfare as it applies to space. That
begins with the fundamental principles that define warfare in all
domains and an understanding of the history behind space as warfighting
domain.

3\) Other [Potential Adversaries]{.underline}

While their concepts and capabilities are less well-developed, [smaller
nations such as Iran and the DPRK are]{.underline} also [investing
heavily in cyberspace and exploring the effects on other
domains]{.underline}. There is limited evidence of explicit multi-domain
thinking within the current doctrine or activities of either country;
however, [both are seeking to enhance the use of cyber capabilities
within their own joint operations]{.underline}. [Iran's]{.underline}
concepts [of 'Retaliatory Deterrence' and 'Mosaic Warfare' increasingly
seek to exploit the cyber domain and encourage more deeply integrated
joint operations, primarily aimed at **deterring** US-led
intervention]{.underline}. Capitalising on opportunities presented by
new technologies, [Teheran is investing in cyber forces and capabilities
to extend the reach of its deterrence strategy in conjunction with
**long-range ballistic and cruise missiles**]{.underline} (McInnis,
2017; DIA, 2019). [The DPRK is also pursuing a]{.underline}n apparent
[shift towards warfighting]{.underline} beyond the traditional domains,
viewing cross-domain integration and coordination of effects as a 'force
multiplier' (Paul et al., 2018). [This includes leveraging cyberspace
and the EMS to defeat a militarily superior adversary by targeting
vulnerabilities]{.underline} or dependencies within C2 networks [to
**undermine cohesion** within]{.underline} or between [allied
adversaries and erode their will to fight]{.underline} (Paul et al.,
2018; Tasic, 2019).

**[3. IMPLICATIONS FOR NATO]{.underline}**

Ongoing initiatives by Allies and adversaries alike [emphasise the need
to consider future threats in cyberspace]{.underline} and the EMS not in
isolation but rather [in terms of convergence with operations and
vulnerabilities in other domains]{.underline}. At the Alliance level,
these [complex interlinkages present both opportunities and challenges
for NATO]{.underline}. Novel technologies and concepts associated with
[cyberspace]{.underline}, space [and information operations]{.underline}
or activities in the EMS potentially [offer new ways and means to
understand, influence, deter and ultimately **defeat
adversaries**]{.underline} through MDO. There are, however, considerable
gaps between future ambitions and present realities. Addressing known
shortfalls in cyber capabilities and MDO at the national level
represents a significant, long-term and resource-intensive challenge.
Integrating and cohering initiatives across an Alliance of 30 nations
only increases the complexity of transformation 'exponentially' (Sharpy,
2020).

To address growing external threats posed by adversaries employing
cyber-attacks as part of cross-domain manoeuvre, [NATO must first
understand its internal barriers, limitations and
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline} regarding MDO. [Only then can Allies
agree a common approach to]{.underline} developing the future concepts,
policies and permissions, C2, [capabilities]{.underline} and innovation
ecosystem [**required** to compete in such a contested operational
environment]{.underline}. The following sections address each of these
themes in turn.

A. Conceptual Difficulties

NATO's challenges start with language (Heren, 2020; Reilly, 2020). There
is no single definition of MDO employed consistently across the US
services, let alone NATO (Donnelly & Farley, 2019; Smagh, 2020).
According to Jeff Reilly of the US Air Command and Staff College, the
ongoing revolution in the technology and threat environment 'mandates a
greater investment of intellectual energy in the concept before it will
be accepted by the military and defence communities within NATO'
(Reilly, 2020: p. 2). This includes wargaming, modelling and simulation
and experimentation to socialise, stress-test and refine MDO concepts
(Zadalis, 2018).

Though arguably most mature in its thinking, the US is still working to
build a common understanding of domains and of MDO, including why it is
necessary, how it is novel or different from joint operations, and how
to translate it into practice; including through a new Joint Warfighting
Concept and related initiatives such as Joint All-Domain Command and
Control (JADC2) capabilities (Grispen-Gelens, 2020). NATO remains even
earlier in development: explicit MDO terminology such as convergence is
largely absent from NATO doctrine, and has only recently begun featuring
in national documents among European Allies such as France, Norway and
the UK (Watling & Roper, 2019).

Whether 'multi-domain' is an enduring concept or simply the latest
'buzzword' in military thinking also remains to be seen. If the latter,
there is a chance that US thinking may shift away from MDO before NATO
has even begun to fully mature its own concept (Spirtas, 2018). As with
many buzzwords, there is potential for conceptual confusion or for
misappropriation of the latest fashionable concept to provide political
and intellectual cover for enduring competition among individual service
branches for new funding and responsibilities in emerging domains such
as cyberspace and space (Grest & Heren, 2019).

[NATO is evolving its understanding of multi-domain
synergies]{.underline} while doctrine, policies, plans, C2 structures
and capabilities for the cyber and space domains remain immature. The
Allies approved a high-level Military Vision and Strategy on Cyberspace
as a Domain of Operations in June 2018 (NATO, 2020b) and NATO only
recently published the first edition of AJP- 3.20 Allied Joint Doctrine
for Cyberspace Operations covering cyberspace operations in January
2020. [Reservations lodged by Allies include US concerns about how NATO
defines and understands domains and the information
environment]{.underline} (NATO, 2020c). NATO is also busy
operationalising the Military Strategy adopted in 2019, implementing
readiness initiatives, developing theatre-wide strategies, and graduated
response plans, and working up both the NWCC and a new Concept for the
Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area (NATO, 2019a; NATO,
2020f). With so many competing priorities already on the Alliance's
agenda, finding the political, institutional and intellectual bandwidth
needed to agree a common lexicon and concept of MDO---and cyberspace's
role therein---is a challenge.

NATO faces another difficulty not shared by adversaries. While Russia
and China can focus conceptual, force and capability development efforts
on a specific foe (the US and NATO) and region (their near abroad),
[NATO must plan and prepare for wide-reaching scenarios.]{.underline} A
multi-domain concept and set of forces configured to address Russia in
northern and eastern Europe might be ill-suited to operating in the
Mediterranean, countering Iran in the Gulf, or deterring China in the
Indo-Pacific. [One]{.underline} potential [risk is a **divergence**
between US efforts]{.underline} to design MDO and JADC2 networks
[primarily to address China and any NATO system-of-systems for MDO
oriented towards Russia]{.underline} (Grispen-Gelens, 2020).

B. Policy Tensions

[**Policy differences** exacerbate conceptual ones.]{.underline} Allies
differ in their policy and legal constraints, strategic cultures, threat
perception, resources, planning and budgetary cycles and forces
(Sondhaus, 2006). While solidarity ultimately remains NATO's strongest
asset, these [differences create seams that **adversaries can
exploit**]{.underline}. [This is especially so with
cyberspace]{.underline}, where [there is more sensitivity and less
commonality]{.underline} to emerging national approaches than in more
established domains, and to MDO, [which is inherently **predicated on
integration and interoperability**]{.underline} (Sharpy, 2020).

[**Information sharing** is especially problematic for the cyber
dimension]{.underline} of MDO, with Allies reticent to share details of
their capabilities across NATO given security concerns and political
sensitivities. [The issue of permissions is also a 'significant
challenge in the development of cyber capabilities']{.underline},
especially where [reconnaissance on Allied soil and networks is required
to detect hostile cyber activity]{.underline} (Watling & Roper, 2019).
[Nations also have differing policy, legal and ethical stances on key
technologies]{.underline} on which MDO relies. [This includes the use of
**offensive cyber capabilities**]{.underline} or basing of hypersonic
missiles or longrange penetrating fires in Europe, which some fear could
be destabilising and escalatory (Quintin & Vanholme, 2020). NATO
similarly lacks a common approach to governance and use of AI, autonomy
and automation, all envisaged as essential enablers for JADC2 (Williams,
2020). This affects the levels of autonomy (with the human in, on or out
of the loop) used for sensor data fusion and decision-making, or to
deliver effects using uncrewed platforms, automated cyber systems and
human-machine teaming (Scharre, 2018).

In considering cooperation and burden-sharing, Allies face several
dilemmas depending on their ambitions and resources for both cyberspace
and MDO. [The US must]{.underline} overcome domestic inter-service
rivalries and [decide how to **integrate partners**, including whether
it can accept a **multinational vision** of MDO that is]{.underline} not
imposed on smaller allies---or excludes them entirely, at NATO's
expense---but rather is **[genuinely collaborative]{.underline}**
(Watling & Roper, 2019). Larger European nations face the dilemma of
whether to buy into a US-led architecture and system-of-systems with
implications for freedom of action, data-sharing and procurement
choices, or shoulder the costs of sovereign or multinational
alternatives.11 They also face choices over how best to contribute to
multinational MDO: whether to aspire to full-spectrum capabilities to
allow sovereign action and offer redundancy to Allies' capabilities or
to specialise in certain domains (e.g. cyber) to offer niche capability
and buy leverage with the US and NATO by making themselves
indispensable. Smaller nations must decide how to influence larger
Allies and NATO, and what to do if they lack cyber capabilities (or
others deemed central to MDO, e.g. long-range fires) or their forces are
too small to operate or gain MDO experience at echelons above brigade
(Watling & Roper, 2019).

The economic fallout of COVID-19 also raises renewed questions about
affordability and the extent to which Allies are willing and able to
invest in new cyber capabilities---though some may see these as
cost-efficient alternatives to land, air or maritime forces---and how
they time investments in ambitious transformation programmes such as MDO
(Clark, 2020). Timing presents both threats and opportunities from a
cyber perspective. Rapid, hasty transformation risks undermining NATO
cohesion and interoperability or creating vulnerabilities in JADC2
systems with immature cyber defences (Donaldson & Sciarini, 2019b).
Conversely, overly cautious change risks ceding ground to adversaries
such as Russia and China which are investing heavily in asymmetric
means, including offensive cyber capabilities, to gain an information
advantage over NATO (Kilcullen, 2020).

The most likely outcome may be a variegated approach, with some Allies
(including the US) taking the lead on conceptual and capability
development for MDO, creating national or mini-lateral networks for
JADC2, and then building up a looser degree of interoperability at NATO
level (Watling & Roper, 2019).

C. Capability and Force Development Priorities

Assuming NATO can overcome conceptual and policy hurdles, significant
effort will still be required to develop the necessary forces and
capabilities across all domains, but perhaps especially for cyberspace.

[Operationalising MDO demands a 'calibrated force posture' with
multi-domain formations strategically positioned]{.underline}, held at
readiness and able to de ploy over large distances, trained and equipped
to operate across multiple contested domains (Grispen-Gelens, 2020).
[The vision is]{.underline} for different sensors and shooters to share
and fuse data, [build a common operating picture, inform rapid
decision-making and deliver effects at a time and place of the
commander's choosing]{.underline} and to do so agnostic of domains,
nation, service or platform (Niewood, Grant & Lewis, 2019). Forces must
operate at pace and against an adversary contesting all domains. This
tempo necessitates moving beyond NATO's past focus on synchronisation of
pre-planned effects in individual domains towards more agile targeting
and more resilience against hostile attempts at 'disorganisation' or
'systems attack' (Thomas, 2019; Engstrom, 2018).

Linking all this together demands novel approaches to C4ISR, as
reflected in investments in JADC2 (Harrigian, 2020). This US initiative
leverages advances in information and communication technologies such as
mesh networks, cloud and edge computing, open architectures, data
analytics, AI and machine learning, autonomy and automation,
software-defined systems, robotics, satellite communications and
sophisticated cyber and EMS capabilities (Hitchens, 2019). Future JADC2
networks must be secure, robust, resilient, agile and more
decentralised, with enough bandwidth to share data in a timely and
secure manner despite cyber attacks, jamming, spoofing or physical
destruction of communication nodes (Goldfein, 2017). Trust is also
essential, handling data from different sources and at multiple security
levels without making controls so arduous that users and devices cannot
access the network (Donaldson & Sciarini, 2019a).

Reliance on connectivity makes cyberspace, space and the EMS the 'centre
of gravity' for MDO (Hess et al., 2019). JADC2 introduces obvious
challenges from a cyber threat perspective, both in terms of the attack
surface for different threat vectors and the cascading effects from
hostile cyber activity---though, of course, existing centralised C2 hubs
also have their own vulnerabilities to cyber or physical attack (Hess et
al., 2019). [Improved cyber capabilities are not only needed to secure
and enable operations **in other domains**]{.underline} (Reilly, 2020).
Investments by Russia and China to contest cyberspace and the EMS may
also limit the ability of NATO commanders to employ offensive cyber
capabilities at a time and place that will 'converge' with effects
through other domains. Securing networks against disruption is critical
at the operational and strategic levels given requirements for
reach-back to headquarters, especially constraining organisations
responsible for delivering offensive cyber effects, since these are
likely to be physically located in the homeland (Watling & Roper, 2019;
Nettis, 2020)

[Iran fiercely opposes several of NATO's current long-term
objectives.]{.underline} The [Iranian theocracy]{.underline} promotes a
system of governance that [**fundamentally contradicts** the core
interests and values upon which]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline}
alliance [was founded]{.underline}. [This is particularly true in the
realm of basic human rights]{.underline}, such as the systematic use of
torture and executions, freedom of speech and freedom of religion, and
more generally the adherence to the principles of peaceful coexistence
in the international system. In fact, [Iran is perhaps second only to
Russia in the **threat it poses** to the to the long-term objectives of
the NATO alliance]{.underline}. It is therefore not surprising that
there have been a warming of ties between these two historical enemies
in the 1990s. [If NATO wants to continue to be successful in its second
fifty years, it must seek to influence]{.underline} and accommodate
[Tehran.]{.underline}

[Iran will **continue to challenge** core NATO objectives in the
future]{.underline} for several important reasons. First, [it is clearly
in the interest of the NATO alliance to reach a]{.underline}
comprehensive [peace settlement between Israel and its Arab
neighbors]{.underline}. Iran has made no secret of its strong opposition
to the U.S.-sponsored Middle East Peace Process. Since the Iranian
Revolution in 1978-79, Iran has actively sought to obstruct any
accommodation by the Muslim World of the State of Israel, which it
perceives as a continuation of the painful legacy of Western
imperialism.

Second, [Iran is the **only remaining nation** with a common border with
a NATO that has **explicitly and repeatedly** declared its hostile
intentions against at least one of members of the alliance]{.underline}.
During the Cold War, Norway and Turkey were the only two members of the
alliance with a shared physical border with the Soviet Union. While the
commitment to defend the northern NATO flank in North Norway was a
symbolic goal rather than a militarily realistic objective against the
largest military complex in the world at that time on the Kola
Peninsula. Yet, it sent a powerful message that the alliance was
committed to defending its territory. The most realistic territorial
threat against NATO in the future will come from Turkey's eastern
neighbors. With the possible integration of Turkey into the European
Union, the Kurdish problem in the east will most likely become a more
serious source of instability than in the past since the traditional
harsh methods of suppression will not be available to the central
Turkish government. In addition, the ongoing dispute over access to
scarce water resources --- now predominantly controlled by Turkey ---
will become increasingly contentious as the regional consumption of
water is dramatically increased due to extreme high rates of population
growth, rapid urbanization, and improved standards of living. Water
scarcity issues suggest that by the year 2010, [NATO will now have to
make a commitment to stabilize its southeastern flank against external
pressure. Iran has tremendous leverage over any lasting settlement of
ties between Turkey and the larger NATO alliance]{.underline}, and
states in the Middle East and Central Asia. In short, it is clearly in
NATO's interest to reach a comprehensive and lasting accommodation with
the government in Tehran over transborder issues involving Turkey.

Third, [Iran is one of the key players in an emerging regional and
international nuclear arms race]{.underline}, not so much for its
capabilities as [for its perceived hostile intentions]{.underline}.
Publicly, [the United States quotes missile attack from "rogue states,"
such as Iran]{.underline} and North Korea, [as the justification for
developing and deploying a missile defense system.]{.underline} However,
many analysts believe that the system is intended to counter the missile
threat from China since Iran's and North Korea's overall offensive
capabilities are disproportionate to the planned U.S. defensive
capacity. Moreover, many analysts believe [that such a system will have
the **unintended** effect of provoking a **large-scale missile
build-up.**]{.underline} The real question is not whether Iran has the
intention or technical will to acquire nuclear weapons or not; it is
which strategic variables factor into the Iranian regime's
threat-response and cost-benefit analyses. It has surely not escaped the
decision-makers in Tehran that deployment of nuclear missiles will
almost certainly trigger a regional and international arms race. [If
NATO intends to prevent a serious build-up of weapons of mass
destruction capabilities]{.underline} on its southeastern border, [it
must influence Iran]{.underline}'s ever more rational decision-makers by
acknowledging Iran's legitimate security concerns.

Fourth, the [conflict with Iran will in the future test the internal
unity of NATO]{.underline}. [The United States perceives the conflicts
in the Middle East in the context of terrorism, weapons of mass
destruction, and the flow of oil to the world market]{.underline}. The
European Union is increasingly concerned with the influx of refugees
from the Middle East and North Africa to Western Europe. Illegal
immigration is challenging the core values of all liberal democracies in
the Europe. Over the last two decades, the far right in nearly every
European country has seen a tremendous increase in support by exploiting
dark xenophobic undercurrents in the population at large. Newly arrived
immigrants in Western Europe have not assimilated over time in the same
way as massive immigration has in the United States. European
politicians increasingly see illegal immigration as a serious challenge
to the social fabric of Europe, and there is building consensus that
future immigration must be seriously curtailed. Iran is a vital
important player in Europe's immigration woes. [Iran has for many years
given shelter to the largest refugee population in the world, and has
the power to control several regional conflicts that can create massive
refugee problems]{.underline}, [which will eventually spill over to
Europe.]{.underline} Rather than deal solely at home with the difficult
issues surrounding immigration, [Europe and the NATO alliance will be
**forced** to deal with political and economic conditions which give
rise to immigration at the source.]{.underline} [Iran's
partnership]{.underline} in this process [will be critical to its
success.]{.underline}

Finally, Iran has for a long time been the most effective barrier
against drug trafficking from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Governments in
most countries in the West now list the threat from international
organized crime as a threat to national security. [A change in policy
within Iran would effectively undermine the effort to stop the flow of
narcotics to the markets in Western Europe.]{.underline}

For the above reasons, and due to the fact that differences between
[U.S. and European approaches to dealing with the Iranian clergy have a
potential to weaken the NATO alliance]{.underline}, [overcoming
long-term hostility between Washington and Tehran is a **central
component** in NATO's future.]{.underline} Yet, the true nature of
U.S.-Iranian hostility remains elusive and poorly understood. The
following sections outline the problem. The paper is divided into five
sections. Section II defines long-term hostility by describing the
contemporary and historical background for the conflict and by
distinguishing between different categories of the phenomenon. Section
III evaluates alternative approaches for explaining long-term hostility.
Section IV looks at how improvements in research methodology will yield
more reliable and valid findings. Finally, I propose in Section V a
different contextual approach for understanding the conflict.

#### Iran war [goes nuclear]{.underline}  {#iran-war-goes-nuclear .Analytic}

**Hussain 21** -- (Murtaza Hussain; \"The Iran War That Obama Tried to
Avoid Is Now Around the Corner\"; Intercept;
https://theintercept.com/2021/12/07/iran-war-nuclear-weapons-biden-trump/;

**[THE UNITED STATES is going to war with Iran.]{.underline}**

That conclusion seems unavoidable watching President Joe [Biden fail to
revive the Iran nuclear deal]{.underline} from which the Trump
administration unilaterally withdrew in 2018. The Iranian side has
demanded the removal of sanctions imposed by former President Donald
Trump, as well as a guarantee that a future U.S. administration will not
once again abruptly pull out of the nuclear deal, which is known as the
JCPOA. While Iran has continued to abide by the minimum terms of the
deal in order to preserve the possibility of bringing it back to life,
[Biden's unwillingness or inability to meet its terms has left observers
now warning of a "worst-case" scenario in which Iran proceeds to
**weaponize its nuclear program** and the two countries come to a
**full-blown armed conflict**.]{.underline}

It is worth reflecting on how both sides came to this point. [The
nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration was a means of
averting war by placing Iran's nuclear program under international
monitoring in exchange for economic integration with the
West.]{.underline} [That agreement was abruptly torn up by
Trump]{.underline}, seemingly in a fit of personal pique at President
Barack Obama, with the encouragement of hawkish advisers and former
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In place of a diplomatic
arrangement, the [Trump administration waged a campaign of economic
pressure, sabotage, and assassinations targeting Iranian
leadership.]{.underline}

Those efforts did great harm to innocent Iranians as well as to U.S.
diplomatic standing. They have not done what the diplomatic agreement
did: actually curb Iran's nuclear program. [Iran today remains under
U.S. sanctions that have severely harmed its economy and sent its people
into desperation. Its nuclear program, however, **has continued to
advance**]{.underline}. The Biden administration's failure or incapacity
to do the minimum of reversing Trump's economic sanctions has likely put
an end to the old agreement. [Absent the 2015 nuclear deal, the only two
options left on the table are the international community accepting an
**Iran with nuclear weapons** capability or **going to war to stop
it**.]{.underline}

The truly depressing thing is that even if Biden wasn't dragging his
feet, it is unclear whether the original deal was even revivable after
Trump showed that the U.S. could turn against it without notice.
[Western companies that had expressed an interest in investing in the
Iranian market when the deal was first negotiated have been scared
off]{.underline}, likely for good. "Even if the JCPOA was restored, no
Western company would dare invest a cent in Iran, no Western bank would
finance any deal in Iran with the threat of the return of US sanctions
in 2025. Once was enough. The Iranians know it," former French diplomat
Gérard Araud observed in a tweet.

In addition to its unwillingness to lift the Trump-era sanctions and its
inability to make executive promises that bind future administrations,
the [Biden administration]{.underline} probably [lacks the majority
votes it would need in the U.S. Senate to ratify the deal as a
treaty]{.underline}. That means the odds of another rug-pulling in 2025
are high if a Republican administration comes to office. Absent the
ability to guarantee the not-unreasonable demand that a signed deal be
adhered to, the [U.S. faces the prospect of being **structurally
unable** to carry out the type of complex diplomacy **necessary to avert
war or nuclear proliferation**.]{.underline}

Regional powers are already sending strong signals that they are
preparing for a major conflict over the issue.

In recent days, top-ranking Israeli military officials have visited the
headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command for meetings said to
be about the deteriorating situation with Iran. The Israeli defense
establishment has been divided in its views on the Iranian nuclear
issue, with some officials contradicting the position held by Netanyahu
that the deal is an unacceptable threat to Israeli security. But [even
Israeli officials who have said that Iran is not close to making a bomb
have begun to signal that airstrikes are now on the table,]{.underline}
[particularly as]{.underline} it appears that [the nuclear program may
soon be freed of the oversight imposed by the original
dea]{.underline}l. In addition to discussing strikes against nuclear
targets in Iran, Israeli news reports this week have claimed that
[officials are even pushing their U.S. counterparts to carry out strikes
against Iranian targets]{.underline} elsewhere in the Middle East.

In the big picture, Iran is not completely free of blame for this
predicament. Its decision to make Israel its primary villain in its
public rhetoric despite the absence of any concrete territorial dispute
between the two countries has mired it in a serious conflict that it may
otherwise have avoided. But the fact remains that the [2015 nuclear
deal, which Iranian diplomats]{.underline} at the time [characterized as
a first step toward broader conversations on areas of disagreement with

that Trump decided to tear it up]{.underline} and that the Biden
administration has failed to reverse the steps that Trump took. The
response to the question "What now?" has no easy or comforting answers.

major war with Iran comes, including airstrikes, naval conflict, and
possible ground operations involving U.S. troops,]{.underline} most
[Americans will have forgotten the precipitating events]{.underline}
that brought the two countries to this point, as well as the people
responsible for destroying a diplomatic agreement intended to prevent
bloodshed. After 20 years of conflict in the Middle East and Central
Asia, Americans are clearly fatigued and eager to avoid new wars in the
region. [Despite how tired they may be of confrontation, their **leaders
seem bent on having one more** --- **perhaps the biggest of
all.**]{.underline}

#### A [unified]{.underline} NATO is key to project [credible deterrence]{.underline} against Russia -- tolerating Russia only incites [further aggression]{.underline} {#a-unified-nato-is-key-to-project-credible-deterrence-against-russia-tolerating-russia-only-incites-further-aggression .Analytic}

Following his election victory, Prime Minister Trudeau and his new
government urgently need to address the multiple security and foreign
policy challenges facing Canada and our allies. These include the
persistent and growing threats of foreign interference and cyber
operations targeting Canada, and the danger of Russia and China's
transnational repression, human rights violations and aggression in
Europe, Asia and beyond.

[Of particular concern to Canada and its Northern allies is the
Kremlin's rapid militarization of the Arctic and Russia's recent claim
to all the resources under the entire Arctic Sea]{.underline} -- right
up to Canada's 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone. This, coupled with
China's expanding interest in the region, represents a potential future
challenge to Canada's sovereignty and mobility in the High North.

[Canada's allies on NATO's Eastern flank continue to face various forms
of aggression from Russia and Belarus, including information warfare and
other forms of grey-zone hybrid aggression.]{.underline} Most recently,
the [Lukashenka regime in Belarus has weaponized thousands of innocent
migrants who]{.underline} have been lured to Belarus from Iraq and
elsewhere, and then forced to cross into Lithuania, Latvia and Poland by
Belarusian authorities. The [migrants are used to destabilize border
regions and incite domestic political conflict.]{.underline}

Many of these issues were discussed during a high-level dialogue on
Canadian and Baltic Sea region security and cooperation, hosted by the
Macdonald-Laurier Institute. The dialogue highlighted the strengths of
some of the approaches Canada has taken, lead among them being the
Canadian-led NATO enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) mission in Latvia and
Operation Unifier in Ukraine.

Canada's leadership of the eFP in Latvia helps strengthen the
transatlantic relationship beyond the obvious security considerations.
Through it, Canada can raise its diplomatic profile and develop
significant and lasting linkages between government officials,
diplomats, and experts in the Baltic Sea region. Thus, when Canada faces
challenging issues such as the arbitrary detention of Michael Kovrig and
Michael Spavor by China, [NATO members can be counted on to support
us.]{.underline}

Most importantly, the eFP represents clear, meaningful, and targeted
deterrence. It imposes significant cost if the Russian government
engages in hostile action against the Baltic states or Poland. It draws
a definitive red line, which if violated will result in significant
consequences. However, [NATO's deterrence operations remain **largely
limited** to conventional warfare and do not yet fully cover evolving
hybrid and grey-zone threats -- including information warfare and other
forms of interference operations.]{.underline}

[The Canadian Armed Forces have endeavoured to address the threat of
disinformation, but those **efforts have been hindered** by a series of
unfortunate missteps and domestic misinformation about
them]{.underline}. Conversely, Canada's Baltic allies have developed
robust strategies to build broad social and political resilience against
foreign disinformation and influence operations. [Canada should be
working with]{.underline} them and [NATO to form a common strategy to
deter non-linear types of **warfare and aggression,** which threaten our
democratic processes, institutions and social cohesion.]{.underline}

Cautious engagement with our adversaries should remain one tool within
our broader diplomatic tool kit. Yet Canada should learn from the
experiences of our allies and recognize that states like [Russia and
China are **not constrained** by the same respect for transparency,
democratic values, or the rule of law.]{.underline} The Canadian
government should be aware that [foreign regimes may engage in the
theatre of diplomacy]{.underline} to distract from their true intentions
and actions.

There is also concern that [tolerating Russian aggression and advocating
for greater engagement and integration may only further encourage bad
behaviour]{.underline}. In the case of Nord Stream 2, [for
example]{.underline}, some NATO members have knowingly increased
European dependence on Russian energy resources despite [the Kremlin's
well documented use of energy as a political tool.]{.underline}

**[A united NATO is critically important to projecting credible
deterrence]{.underline}**. The erosion of domestic trust and confidence
in the Alliance among its member states, including Canada, represents a
threat to this cohesion. A proposal to withdraw Canada from NATO was
tabled at a recent policy conference for one of Canada's three major
political parties. The proposal was defeated, but it represents a fringe
anti-NATO narrative within Canada's illiberal left; if left unaddressed,
such a narrative could grow.

[If countries like Russia perceive NATO as an atomized collection of
states with varied priorities rather than a **unified front,** the
Alliance is exposed to a **significant risk of miscalc**ulation in which
a foreign adversary might believe they can cross a red line and only
face a limited response.]{.underline} Thus, gaps in cohesion within the
alliance directly threaten to undermine political and military
deterrence. The Alliance and members states must work towards improving
communications strategies to foster greater basic general understanding
of NATO's purpose, its missions and its role in protecting its members
against external threats.

Similarly, [if we see threats as atomized or disparate, we may lack the
capacity to adequately respond]{.underline}. Organized GRU terrorist
attacks in Czechia, the Salisbury poisonings, transnational repression
and censorship, cyberwarfare, disinformation, and overt military
posturing all pose threats that are aimed at the same essential goal:
undermining and supplanting the power of liberal democracy and advancing
authoritarianism. Through this lens, challenges posed by other actors,
including China, must also be considered as part of the broader range of
shared threats posed to the democratic community as a whole.

If we are to succeed in tackling these shared threats, [greater
transatlantic cooperation is needed]{.underline}. It cannot remain
stagnant, however; [it must evolve and expand.]{.underline} The serious
nature of the threats, [their potential to **become kinetic**, and the
possibility of **adversarial coordination** (whether formal or informal)
means that we must expand our tools to meet these
challenges.]{.underline}

In the case of Ukraine, on whose border the Kremlin mobilized over
100,000 troops this past summer, the Alliance should consider extending
a Membership Action Plan despite the skepticism of some allies. Ukraine
must also be empowered in a similar fashion to frontline NATO states
like the Baltic states and Poland. After all, the eFP mission in Latvia
not only provides military deterrence, but strengthens interlinkages,
develops societal resilience, and provides clear and sustained
solidarity.

Finally, [the growing threats of foreign interference, information
warfare, cyber attacks and emerging threats to Canada's Arctic requires
a coherent long-term strategy and an evolved notion of **collective
defence**]{.underline}, which includes strengthening our partnerships
with non-NATO allies in Europe, Asia, and around the world.

[Until we impose consequences that force Moscow and Beijing to
strategically reconsider their ongoing efforts to probe the extreme
boundaries of our threat tolerance, they will continue to test our
capacity and political will to confront their aggression]{.underline}.
This requires a common understanding and acknowledgement of the threats.
[It took Russian aggression in 2007 in Estonia, 2008 in Georgia, and the
invasion of Ukraine in 2014 to achieve a basic common understanding of
the threat posed by Vladimir Putin's government]{.underline}. Since
then, NATO's eFP missions have thus far deterred Vladimir Putin's
neo-imperialist ambitions in the Baltic Sea region.

[We must work towards achieving a **similar consensus on the threats**
posed by Russia and China]{.underline}'s use of information and
influence operations, as well as economic, cyber and political warfare
against the community of democracies and the developing world at large
in order [to develop resilience and a common defence against
them.]{.underline}

### Nuke escalation

#### Cyber deterrence failure guarantees rapid nuclear escalation

**Cimbala 22** (Stephen J. Cimbala, Stephen J. Cimbala is Distinguished
Professor of Political Science, Penn State Brandywine, an American
Studies faculty member, "Nuclear-Crisis Management and Cyber War---A
Dangerous Crossroads," Naval War College Review, Winter 2022,

LH

Cyber weapons should appeal to those who prefer a nonnuclear, or even a
postnuclear, military-technical arc of development. War in the digital
domain offers, at least in theory, a possible means of crippling or
disabling enemy assets without the need for kinetic attack, or at least
while minimizing physical destruction.4 [Nuclear weapons]{.underline},
on the other hand, [are the very epitome of "mass"
destruction]{.underline}, such that their use for deterrence---the
avoidance of war by the manipulation of risk---is preferred to the
actual firing of same. Unfortunately, [neither nuclear deterrence nor
cyber war will be able to live in a distinct policy universe for the
near or distant future.]{.underline}

Nuclear weapons, whether held back for deterrence or fired in anger, are
incorporated into systems for command, control, communications,
computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR). The
weapons and their C4ISR systems must be protected from attacks both
kinetic and digital in nature. [In addition, the decision makers who
must manage nuclear forces during a crisis ideally should have the best
possible information about the status of their own nuclear and cyber
forces and command systems]{.underline}, about the forces and C4ISR of
possible attackers, and about the probable intentions and risk
acceptance of possible opponents. In short, [the task of managing a
nuclear crisis demands good information and clear thinking]{.underline}.
But the [employment of **cyber weapons** in the early stages of a crisis
**could impede clear assessments** by creating confusion in networks and
the action channels that depend on those networks]{.underline}.5 The
[temptation to take preemptive cyber action]{.underline}---for example,
intrusive cyber reconnaissance of commandand-control (C2)
systems---[might "succeed" to the point at which nuclear-crisis
management becomes weaker instead of stronger. Related to this, one
challenge of the second nuclear age is that **conventional war is more
likely to take place within a nuclear context**.]{.underline} Paul
Bracken has noted the following:

Cyber's effect on conventional operations has barely been considered in
the current nuclear debate. **[Cyber could cripple U.S. command and
control.]{.underline}** Space war is also overlooked. Disruptions, from
cyber, ASAT \[antisatellite\], and hacks to our reconnaissance
system\[,\] make good sense from the enemy point of view, to blind our
reconnaissance targeting. [This would turn our precision strike force
into blunt carpet bombing, and likely \[result in\] a vast increase in
collateral damage.]{.underline} Obviously this has political
implications. [It could lead to a U.S. reluctance to act.]{.underline}
This may well be the real intent of such a move on the part of the
enemy, to create a kind of nuclear digital brinkmanship that forces the
United States to back off in a crisis.6

[IT systems provide invaluable intelligence]{.underline} during a
crisis, using databases, big data, visualization,
geographic-information-systems mapping, artificial intelligence (AI),
image recognition, and other means[. If the confidentiality, integrity,
or availability of these systems is doubtful, leaders will feel that
they have lost control and are left groping for options]{.underline}.

Ironically, the [downsizing of U.S. and post-Soviet Russian strategic
nuclear arsenals]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War, while a
positive development from the perspectives of nuclear arms control and
nonproliferation[, makes the **confluence of cyber- and nuclear-attack
capabilities** more alarming.]{.underline} The overkill deployments of
missiles and bombers and expansive numbers of weapons that the Cold War
Americans and Soviets deployed had at least one virtue; those arsenals
provided so much redundancy against first-strike vulnerability that
relatively linear systems for nuclear-attack warning, C2, and responsive
launch, under or after attack, sufficed. At the same time, Cold War
tools for military cyber action were primitive compared with those
available now. In addition, countries and their armed forces were less
dependent on the fidelity of their information systems for national
security. Thus, [the reduction of U.S., Russian, and possibly other
forces to the size of "**minimum deterrents" might compromise nuclear
flexibility** and resilience in the face of kinetic attacks preceded or
accompanied by cyber war]{.underline}.7 In addition, although the
mathematics of minimum deterrence would shrink the size of attackers' as
well as defenders' arsenals, [defenders with smaller-size]{.underline}
forces might have greater fears of absolute, compared with relative,
losses, and therefore [might be more prone to preemption-dependent
strategies than defenders with larger forces would be.]{.underline} One
of the reasons for Cold War force redundancy was that superpowers lacked
confidence in the reliability or availability of some of their nuclear
systems.

[Offensive and defensive]{.underline} information warfare (infowar), as
well as other [cyberrelated activities, is obviously very much on the
minds of U.S. military leaders and others in the American and allied
national-security establishments]{.underline}.8 [Russia also has been
explicit about its cyber-related concerns.]{.underline} In early July
2013, President Vladimir V. Putin urged the Russian Security Council to
improve state security against cyber attacks.9 Russian security expert
Vladimir I. Batyuk, commenting favorably on a June 2013 U.S.-Russian
agreement for the protection, control, and accounting of nuclear
materials (a successor to the then recently expired NunnLugar agreement
on nuclear risk reduction), warned that pledges by Presidents Putin and
Barack H. Obama of cooperation on cybersecurity were even more
important: "Nuclear weapons are a legacy of the 20th century. The
challenge of the 21st century is cybersecurity."10 On the other hand,
arms control for cyber is apt to run into daunting security and
technical issues, even assuming a successful navigation of political
trust for matters as sensitive as these. Of special significance is
whether cyber armscontrol negotiators can certify that hackers operating
within their own states are sufficiently under control for cyber
verification and transparency. [There is extensive evidence that Russia,
China, and other states use civilian hackers to support national
goals]{.underline}. For example, some sources attributed Russia's
hacking into the e-mail account of the Democratic National Committee in
2016 to "Guccifer 2.0"---an homage to the original Romanian hacker using
that name. Some forensic evidence supports the hypothesis that Guccifer
2.0 was run by the Russian FSB (the country's principal security
agency), with some involvement by Russian military intelligence.11
Another uncertainty is the potential role of hacktivists who routinely
join in conflicts even without state sanction. If a country is in a
state-versus-state crisis, then finds itself on the receiving end of an
effective, widespread cyber attack that affects "the man on the street,"
pressure on the government for a kinetic (i.e., military) response may
become overwhelming. Technically minded, determined individuals or small
groups of hacktivists now have the potential to shake the world through
cyber warfare.

The cyber domain cuts across the other geostrategic domains for warfare
as well: land, sea, air, and space. On the other hand, [the cyber
domain, compared with the others, suffers from a lack of historical
perspective;]{.underline} it "has been created in a short time and has
not had the same level of scrutiny as other battle domains," as one
author has argued.12 What this might mean for the cyber-nuclear
intersection is far from obvious.

[CRISIS MANAGEMENT]{.underline} Definitions and Parameters Crisis
management, including nuclear-crisis management, is both a competitive
and a cooperative endeavor between military adversaries. A crisis is, by
definition, a time of great tension and uncertainty.13 Threats are in
the air, and time pressure on policy makers seems intense. Each side has
objectives that it wants to attain and values that it deems important to
protect[. During a crisis, state behaviors are **especially interactive
and interdependent** with those of another state]{.underline}. It would
not be too farfetched to refer to this interdependent stream of
interstate crisis behaviors as a system, provided the term system is not
understood as referring to something completely separate from the state
or individual behaviors that make it up. The system aspect implies
reciprocal causation of the crisis behaviors of A by B and vice versa.

One aspect of crisis management is this deceptively simple question:
What defines a crisis as such? When does the latent capacity of the
international order for violence or hostile threat assessment cross over
into the terrain of actual crisis behavior? A breakdown of general
deterrence in the system raises threat perceptions among various actors,
but it does not guarantee that any particular relationship will
deteriorate into specific deterrent or compellent threats. In defining
the onset of a crisis, Patrick M. Morgan offers the useful concept of
immediate deterrence failure: specific sources of hostile intent have
been identified by one state with reference to another, threats have
been exchanged, and responses now must be decided on.14 The passage into
a crisis is equivalent to the shift from a Hobbesian world of
omnipresent potential violence to the actual movement of troops and
exchanges of diplomatic démarches.

All crises are characterized to some extent by a high degree of threat;
a short time for decision; and a "fog of crisis"---reminiscent of
Clausewitz's "fog of war"---that confuses crisis participants about what
is happening. Before modern scholars ever invented the discipline of
crisis management, historians had captured the rush-to-judgment
character of much crisis decision-making among great powers.15 The
influence of nuclear weapons on crisis decision-making is not easy to
measure or document, because the avoidance of war can be ascribed to
many causes. The presence of nuclear forces obviously influences the
degree of destruction that can be inflicted should crisis management
fail. Short of that catastrophe, the greater interest of scholars is in
how the presence of nuclear weapons might affect the decision-making
process itself in a crisis. The problem is conceptually elusive; there
are so many potentially important causal factors relevant to a decision
on war versus peace. History is full of dependent variables in search of
competing explanations.

Crisis Management: The Requirements [The first **requirement of
successful crisis management is communications transparency.**
Transparency includes clear signaling and undistorted
communications]{.underline}. Signaling refers to the requirement that
each side must send its estimate of the situation to the other. It is
not necessary for the two sides to have identical or even initially
complementary interests, but [a sufficient number of correctly sent and
received signals is a **prerequisite for the effective communication of
goals**]{.underline} and objectives from one side to the other. [If
signals are sent poorly or misunderstood, steps taken by the sender or
receiver may lead to **unintended consequences, including miscalculated
escalation.**]{.underline}

Communications transparency also includes high-fidelity communication
between adversaries and within the respective decision-making structures
of each side. High-fidelity communication in a crisis can be distorted
by everything that might interfere physically, mechanically, or
behaviorally with accurate transmission. Electromagnetic pulses that
disrupt communication circuitry and physical destruction of
communication networks are obvious examples of impediments to
high-fidelity communication. Cultural differences that prevent accurate
understanding of shared meanings between states can confound deterrence
as practiced according to one side's theory. As Keith B. Payne notes
with regard to the potential for deterrence failure in the post--Cold
War period, "Unfortunately, our expectations of opponents' behavior
frequently are unmet, not because our opponents necessarily are
irrational but because we do not understand them---their individual
values, goals, determination, and commitments---in the context of the
engagement, and therefore we are surprised when their 'unreasonable'
behavior differs from our expectations."16

#### Cyberwar uniquely likely to escalate---credible deterrence is a must-have

**Cimbala 22** (Stephen J. Cimbala, Stephen J. Cimbala is Distinguished

Studies faculty member, "Nuclear-Crisis Management and Cyber War---A
Dangerous Crossroads," Naval War College Review, Winter 2022,

LH

POTENTIAL DISRUPTERS Information or [cyber warfare has the potential to
attack or to **disrupt successful crisis management**]{.underline} with
regard to each of the preceding attributes.24 First, infowar [can muddy
the signals being sent from one side to the other in a
crisis]{.underline}. This [can be done deliberately or
inadvertently]{.underline}. Suppose one side plants a virus or worm in
the other's communications networks.25 The virus or worm becomes
activated during the crisis and destroys or alters information. [The
missing or altered information may make it more difficult for the cyber
victim to arrange a military attack; however, destroyed or altered
information also may mislead either side into thinking that its signal
has been interpreted correctly when it has not.]{.underline} Thus, side
A may intend to signal "resolve" instead of "yield" to its opponent on a
particular issue; side B, misperceiving what it has received as a
"yield" message, may decide to continue its aggression, but then meets
unexpected resistance, [causing a much more dangerous situation to
develop.]{.underline} There is also the possibility of cyber-enabled
preemption to disable enemy nuclear missiles before they reach the
launchpad or during the launch itself. Apparently, the United States has
used such "left-of-launch" techniques against North Korea.26 During a
nuclear crisis, would such a move be accepted by the attacked party as
one of intimidation and deterrence or, to the contrary, [would offensive
cyber war against missile launches **prompt a nuclear first use or first
strike by the defender** for fear of losing its retaliatory
capability?]{.underline}

Infowar also [**can destroy or disrupt communication channels**
necessary for successful crisis management.]{.underline} One way [it can
do this is by disrupting communication links between policy makers and
military commanders]{.underline} during a period of high threat and
severe time pressure. Unanticipated problems, from the standpoint of
civil-military relations, may arise under these conditions. For example,
political leaders may have predelegated limited authority for nuclear
release or launch under restrictive conditions; only when these few
conditions obtain, according to the protocols of predelegation, would
military commanders be authorized to employ nuclear weapons distributed
within their commands.27 [Clogged, destroyed, or disrupted
communications could prevent top leaders from knowing that military
commanders perceive a situation to be far more desperate, and thus
**permissive of nuclear initiative**, than it really is.]{.underline}
For example, during the Cold War, disrupted communications between the
U.S. national command authority and ballistic-missile submarines, once
the latter came under attack, could have resulted in a joint decision by
submarine officers and crew, in the absence of contrary instructions, to
launch.

Second, [infowar during a crisis almost certainly will **increase the
time pressure** under which political leaders operate]{.underline}. It
may do this literally, or it may affect the perceived timelines within
which the policy-making process yields its decisions. Once either side
sees parts of its command, control, and communications (C3) system being
subverted by phony information or extraneous cyber noise, its sense of
panic at the possible loss of military options will be enormous. In the
case of American Cold War nuclear war plans, for example, disruption of
even portions of the strategic C3 system could have prevented competent
execution of parts of the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP), the
nation's strategic nuclear war plan. The Cold War SIOP depended on
finely orchestrated time-on-target estimates and precise damage
expectancies against various classes of targets.28 [Partly misinformed
or disinformed networks and communications centers would have led to
**redundant attacks against the same target sets** and, quite possibly,
**unplanned attacks** on friendly military or civilian
installations]{.underline}. Even in the post--Cold War world of flexible
nuclear-response plans, [the potential slide toward
preemption,]{.underline} on the basis of mistaken or exaggerated fears
of C2 vulnerability, [casts a shadow over deterrence
stability.]{.underline} As Blair has warned, "There are no widely
accepted methods for calculating command and control performance under
wartime conditions, and empirical validation of such an assessment
cannot be done. Compared with the tight and tidy standard calculations
of force vulnerability, any objective assessment of command and control
systems would raise more questions than it answered."29

A third potentially disruptive effect of infowar on nuclear-crisis
management is [that it may reduce the search for available alternatives
to the few and desperate.]{.underline} Policy makers seeking escapes
from crisis denouements need flexible options and creative
problem-solving. [Victims of infowar may have a diminished ability to
solve problems routinely, let alone creatively, once information
networks are filled with flotsam and jetsam.]{.underline} Questions to
operators will be posed poorly, and responses (if available at all) will
be driven toward the least common denominator of previously programmed
SOPs[. Retaliatory systems]{.underline} that depend on launchon-warning
dynamics instead of survival after riding out an attack [are especially
vulnerable]{.underline} to reduced time cycles and restricted
alternatives. "A well-designed warning system cannot save commanders
from misjudging the situation under the constraints of time and
information imposed by a posture of launch on warning. Such a posture
truncates the decision process too early for iterative estimates to
converge on reality. [**Rapid reaction is inherently unstable** because
it cuts short the learning time needed to match perception with
reality."]{.underline}3

The propensity to search for the first available alternative that meets
minimum satisfactory conditions of goal attainment is strong enough
under normal conditions in nonmilitary bureaucratic organizations.31 In
civil-military C2 systems under the stress of nuclear-crisis
decision-making, the first available alternative quite literally may be
the last---or so policy makers and their military advisers may persuade
themselves. Accordingly, the bias toward prompt and adequate solutions
is strong. During the Cuban missile crisis, for example, a number of
members of the presidential advisory group continued to propound an air
strike and invasion of Cuba during the entire thirteen days of crisis
deliberation. Had less time been available for debate and had President
Kennedy not deliberately structured the discussion in a way that forced
alternatives to the surface, the air strike and invasion might well have
been the chosen course of action.32 Paul K. Davis and coauthors have
noted the following:

[Usual discussions of crisis stability assume that leaders are in
control of their nuclear capabilities. Again, history is
sobering]{.underline}. President Kennedy became worried in 1961 about
possible unilateral actions by military leaders to prepare a preemptive
strike against the Soviet Union. He instigated efforts to tighten the
President's personal control. Soviet leadership worried about
survivability of its forces and developed capability for launch on
warning and automatic response. Such systems could be the source of
accidental war.33

Fourth and finally on the issue of crisis management, [infowar can cause
flawed images of each side's intentions and capabilities to be conveyed
to the other, with potentially disastrous results]{.underline}. Another
example from the Cuban missile crisis demonstrates the possible side
effects on U.S. crisis management of simple misunderstanding and
noncommunication. At the most tense period of the crisis, a U-2
reconnaissance aircraft got off course and strayed into Soviet airspace.
U.S. and Soviet fighters scrambled, and a possible Arctic confrontation
of air forces loomed. Khrushchev later told Kennedy that Soviet air
defenses might have interpreted the U-2 flight as a prestrike
reconnaissance mission or as a bomber, calling for a compensatory
response by Moscow.34 Fortunately, Moscow chose to give Washington the
benefit of the doubt in this instance and to permit U.S. fighters to
escort the wayward U-2 back to Alaska. Why this scheduled U-2 mission
was not aborted once the crisis began never has been revealed fully; the
answer may be as simple as bureaucratic inertia compounded by
noncommunication down the chain of command by policy makers who failed
to appreciate the risk of "normal" reconnaissance under these
extraordinary conditions.

The significance of the preceding discussion and examples is underscored
by the assessment of expert analyst Martin C. Libicki about the
relationship between cyber war and crisis management.

To generalize, [a situation in which there is little pressure to respond
quickly, in which a temporary disadvantage or loss is tolerable, and in
which there are grounds for giving the other side some benefit of the
doubt is one in which there is time for crisis management to
work]{.underline}. Conversely[, **if the failure to respond quickly
causes a state's position to erode, a temporary disadvantage** or degree
of loss is intolerable, and there are **no grounds for disputing what
happened**,]{.underline} who did it, and why---[then **states may
conclude that they must bring matters to a head
quickly**.35]{.underline}

Recent targets have included [[various parts of the US

extort money.

And these are just the attacks we know about.

One of the most serious intrusions in recent years hit Ukraine\'s

winter of 2015. It showed how cyberattacks could bring societies to
their knees.

with the US even singling out a member of the GRU military intelligence
agency in late 2020.

\"These were the first reported destructive malware attacks against the
control systems of civilian critical infrastructure,\" said John Demers,
the US assistant attorney general at the time, announcing the charges.

[[\"No country has weaponized its cyber capabilities as maliciously and

[[Cyberattacks on civilian
infrastructure]{.underline}](https://www.dw.com/en/us-states-declare-emergency-over-gas-shortage-fears-following-cyberattack/a-57501414)
have triggered broad public concern, and debate on how to protect

#### Nuke war could cause human extinction and destroy biosphere

(JB)

If global nuclear famine could result from just 100 nuclear detonations,
what might be the result of a fuller exchange of the several thousand
warheads held in current inventories by the US and Russia?

[[One 2008 study](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3047679) looked at a
Russia-US nuclear war scenario, where Russia would target 2,200 weapons
on Western countries and the US would target 1,100 weapons each on China
and Russia.]{.underline} In total, therefore, 4,400 warheads detonate,
equivalent to roughly half the current inventories held each by Russia
and the US.

Nuclear weapons held by other states were not used in this scenario,
which has a 440-Mt explosive yield, equivalent to about 150 times all
the bombs detonated in World War II. [This [full-scale nuclear
war]{.mark} was [estimated to cause **770 million direct deaths and
generate 180 Tg of soot**]{.mark} from burning cities and
forests]{.underline}. In the US, about half the population would be
within 5km of a ground zero, and a fifth of the country's citizens would
be killed outright.

A [[subsequent
study]{.underline}](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD030509),
published in 2019, looked at a comparable but slightly lower 150 Tg
atmospheric soot injection following an equivalent scale nuclear war.
[The devastation [causes]{.mark} so much smoke that **[only 30-40
percent of sunlight reach]{.mark}es the [Earth's surface for the
subsequent six months]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A massive drop in temperature follows, with the weather staying below
freezing throughout the subsequent Northern Hemisphere summer. In Iowa,
for example, [the **[model shows temperatures staying below 0°C for 730
days]{.mark} straight**]{.underline}. There is no growing season. This
is a true nuclear winter.

Nor is it just a short blip. Temperatures still drop below freezing in
summer for several years thereafter, and global precipitation falls by
half by years three and four. It takes over a decade for anything like
climatic normality to return to the planet.

By this time, [most of Earth's human population will be long dead. The
[**world's food production would crash by more than 90 percent**,
causing [global
famine](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-830419/v1)]{.mark} that
**[would kill billions]{.mark}**]{.underline} by starvation. In most
countries less than a quarter of the population survives by the end of
year two in this scenario. Global fish stocks [[are
decimated]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008256117)
and the [[ozone layer
collapses]{.underline}](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JD035079).

The models are [[eerily
specific]{.underline}](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-830419/v1/7c33234ad24f7e3c3e83b9ec.pdf).
In the 4,400 warhead/150 Tg soot nuclear war scenario, averaged over the
subsequent five years, China sees a reduction in food calories of 97.2
percent, France by 97.5 percent, Russia by 99.7 percent, the UK by 99.5
percent and the US by 98.9 percent. [In all these countries, virtually
[**everyone who survived** the initial blasts **would**]{.mark}
subsequently **[starve]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### democracy

#### NATO key to democracy---especially important in supporting fledgling democracies

[In what way should one expect NATO to enhance democratic
development]{.underline}? After all, as highlighted above, democracy is
a core principle of the institution. Much of the existing work on NATO
and democratic development points to [**several avenues of possible
influence**: socialization, guidance from NATO about how to create and
implement reforms, NATO pressure to implement reforms, and legitimizing
new democracies by helping them provide the public good of security
through NATO membership]{.underline}. It is important to note that each
of these mechanisms for how NATO could prompt reform should begin
operating before full NATO membership is achieved. Once prospective
members are given a promise of membership in the form of the MAP, they
will be brought into close contact with NATO members and therefore
exposed to the socialization mechanism. If domestic reform is a
necessary condition for NATO membership, prospective members
participating in the MAP should begin reforming so that they can reap
the benefits of membership. Finally, if democratic reforms made to gain
NATO membership persist, [NATO membership should also be associated with
higher levels of democracy in new member states]{.underline}. Below we
discuss each of these means for NATO influence proposed in the
literature.

First, [NATO may have a subtle impact on future member states by
socializing military and civilian leaders from states seeking membership
to respect democratic norms]{.underline}. Democracy is dependent not
only on the formal institutions of a country, but also on whether elites
are willing to abide by democratic constraints on their power rather
than undermine or dismantle them. The example of Poland's recent
democratic backsliding despite the former presence of formal democratic
institutions illustrates this point. Even when democratic reforms
preceded NATO involvement, [**NATO could still have a democratizing
influence by socializing military and civilian elites to respect
democratic reforms**---particularly civilian control of the
military.]{.underline} [NATO created the conditions for regular,
institutionalized interaction between elites from partner states and
longtime member states]{.underline} within the institutional framework
of the alliance and the Partnership for Peace (PfP), making
socialization possible. [NATO taught military officers and civilian
defense policymakers who had served most of their professional lives
under a communist system about the norms of a democracy and their role
in it]{.underline} (Gheciu 2005b). This socialization logic outlined by
Alexandra Gheciu and others is not in conflict with our argument, as we
measure changes in democratic institutions rather than changes in elite
attitudes. However, recent democratic backsliding in some NATO countries
indicates that either the right elites were not socialized by NATO or
the main effect of NATO socialization was teaching elites to value
civilian control of the military and continued engagement with NATO.

Elite socialization began well before NATO membership, with collective
briefings, individualized MAPs for each prospective member state,
NATO-led workshops, military advisers from NATO member states, and
professional education programs (Gheciu 2005b). NATO used these
cooperative activities to teach the goals and norms of the alliance and
assess the commitment of PfP countries to them (Gheciu 2005a). Joint
military exercises, in addition to augmenting the capability aggregation
of the alliance, allowed military elites from NATO states and
prospective member states to interact. Military education
programs---such as the NATO Defence College and programs through partner
states such as the year-long International Fellows program at the US
National Defense University---played a similar role in building military
capability while creating space for socialization through
military-to-military interactions.

[Second, even when countries intended to make democratic reforms on
their own initiative, they often lacked institutional knowledge about
how to reform**. NATO stepped in to provide assistance and advice to
prospective members**]{.underline} regarding how to enact democratic
reforms. Democracy advising was provided through the NATO Parliamentary
Assembly and the associated Rose-Roth seminars. According to Trine
Flockhart (2004), the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and Rose-Roth seminars
brought together parliamentarians from NATO and partner states to
'familiarize legislators with key security issues and debates, to
promote the development of appropriate civil--military relations, and to
facilitate the sharing of expertise and experience in parliamentary
practice and procedures.' These seminars also played a 'very important
social function' as policymakers from NATO and partner countries built
professional networks with one another (Flockhart 2004). Civilian
defense policymakers and military officers from NATO partner countries
were also able to participate in the NATO-adjacent George C. Marshall
Center, which has over 13,300 alumni. Courses at the Marshall Center
[include discussion of **international law, democracy, rule of law, and
human rights** alongside more traditional security topics]{.underline}
(Marshall Center 2019).

Third, [**NATO provided pressure for specific reforms** through direct
communication with a country's NATO liaisons and naming and shaming
countries slacking on reforms.]{.underline} For example, a US
Congressional Research Service report released in 1995 raised concerns
that Poland was not ready for NATO membership. The report stated:
'Initiation into NATO nevertheless may hinge even more on publication of
a democratic Constitution and the legal basis for civilian control.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Defense and many senior officers who set
policy and shape opinions have become mired in political wrangling over
control of the armed forces' (quoted in Epstein 2005, 254--285). As
Rachel Epstein notes, this report was widely publicized in the Polish
media with the effect of shaming Polish officials into complying, given
that NATO membership was by this time an established national foreign
policy goal. When the chief of the Polish General Staff, General Tadeusz
Wilecki, opposed increased civilian control of the military, an
unflattering New York Times article put sufficient pressure on Polish
president Aleksander Kwasniewski that he removed Wilecki (Epstein 2006,
280--281).

[By utilizing naming and shaming tactics and building alliances with
pro-reform domestic politicians, NATO successfully shepherded a select
group of partner states through enacting civilian control of the
military and more internationalized defense policies]{.underline}
(Epstein 2005). Although Poland joined NATO in the 1999 wave of
enlargement, one could argue that the logic of pressure for reforms was
still relevant for the countries that joined NATO in 2004. [The smaller
reforms of hiring personnel supportive of democratic norms and building
political coalitions in support of democracy that Epstein highlights are
**consistent with what we find in our quantitative
analysis**.]{.underline} Some states that rapidly enacted democratic
reforms after transition to democracy in the early 1990s made small
improvements under NATO tutelage, even though their average democracy
scores after reaching NATO applicant status and membership remained
similar to what they had been before. Other NATO-induced changes, such
as the firing of Wilecki in Poland, may have been crucial for continued
progress even though our quantitative data do not measure them. [NATO's
value, then, may be in encouraging states already democratizing to
persist in maintaining democracy despite challenges from domestic
elites.]{.underline} However, any democratizing effect of NATO would be
concentrated on the premembership period, as democracy is in practice
not a condition for remaining a NATO member.

Finally, [NATO can assist in providing the **public good of security**,
which can be **critical for the legitimacy of some new
democracies.**]{.underline} Poast and Urpelainen (2018) argue that
leaders in [transitional democracies use, and often must create,
international organizations to consolidate democratic rule and improve
their ability to distribute public goods to the populations]{.underline}
under their rule. Public goods are broadly defined as policies that
benefit large constituencies in society. Examples of public goods
include internal and external security (Loader and Walker 2007; Bueno de
Mesquita et al. 1999), public infrastructure that increases investment
(Henisz 2002), free and fair elections (Donno 2010), reduction of
corruption (Banerjee 1997), and environmental protection (VanDeveer and
Dabelko 2001). Providing such goods is critical to the survival of
leaders in democratizing states. But because autocratic developing
countries have little need or capacity to improve the provision of
public goods (Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003; Wintrobe 1998),
democratization leaves leaders in newly democratic regimes with a unique
challenge; they face high expectations for public good provision, yet
their administrative apparatus has little experience providing public
goods (Haggard and Kaufman 1997). Therefore, [newly democratic
governments can benefit from outside expertise on public goods
provision, namely that offered by international
organizations]{.underline} (IOs). IOs can assist democratizing states in
the provision of public goods. IOs provide a venue through which members
can pool limited resources or coordinate on policy reforms even with
limited institutional capacity. IOs assist in highly technical tasks,
including advising on governance capacity, monitoring elections, and
facilitating learning about democratic institutions. [**IOs can help
governments of transitional democracies govern effectively** and acquire
the resources to supply public goods to the newly expanded
electorate.]{.underline}

### Hybrid war

#### Hybrid War happening now and will escalate

**Polyakova & Boulègue** (Alina Polyakova President and CEO of CEPA,
Mathieu Boulègue Senior Research Fellow Russia & Eurasia Programme at
Chatham House), 1/29/21, accessed 6/24/22, "THe Evolution of Russian
Hybrid Warfare: Executive Summary",
[[https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-introduction/]{.underline}](https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-introduction/)
(JB)

Russia's military interventions in Syria, Venezuela, and, more recently,
Libya raise the question whether the Kremlin is still being
opportunistic or whether it has revised its military strategy to better
project force around the globe based on a single playbook. These
interventions have taken advantage of preexisting chaos and weakness
that Russia did not directly cause. Together with its growing
conventional power, [[Russia]{.mark} is now far more [confident about
**using hard power in the hybrid mix.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The aforementioned changes in Russian military thinking reflect a
reinvigorated confidence in the efficacy of chaos as a competitive
strategy. If anything, the [**Kremlin leadership feels vindicated about
the usefulness of hard power options**, while categorizing nonmilitary
means as a tool to prepare conflict environments and make the use of
force more
effective.[19](https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-introduction/#footnote_18_7492)]{.underline}
This is best exemplified by Kalev Stoicescu's chapter on Estonia, where
the threat of Russia's military action cannot be dissociated from hybrid
tools aimed at testing the country's resolve below the threshold of
Article V of NATO's founding treaty, which commits the Alliance to
collective defense.

Among the drivers of change in Russian thinking, disappointment and
unexpected outcomes have been some of the most powerful. As Kateryna
Zarembo and Sergiy Solodkyy show, this is most notably the case with
low-intensity military operations in Ukraine: difficulty in upholding a
degree of "plausible deniability" of direct military intervention; war
fatigue; issues with managing proxy groups and local militia; the
failure of "Novorossiya" and other ideological products in
Ukraine;[[20]{.underline}](https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-introduction/#footnote_19_7492)
the absence of an exit strategy in the Donbas, etc. [Russia]{.underline}
has now altered its originally ambitious aim (to control Crimea and the
Donbas) in favor of [perpetuating a persistent, low-scale conflict that
will impede Ukraine's integration into Western security
structures]{.underline}.[[21]{.underline}](https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-introduction/#footnote_20_7492)

Further afield, in the United Kingdom, Precious Chatterje-Doody explores
how **[[Russian hybrid operations]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- mainly
information operations --- [have been [**adapting** in order **to
infiltrate networks, destabilize internal norms,**]{.mark} and
ultimately create an environment conducive to Russian
interests]{.underline}. Oscar Jonsson outlines Russian tactical
adaptations in the EU and NATO, where [[Russian **hybrid tools**]{.mark}
**are [used to increase political polarization]{.mark}** [and challenge
institutional cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[Chaos strategy through hybrid]{.underline}]{.mark}, multi-vector
[[warfare]{.mark} is [here to stay]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[[consequences of this are]{.underline}]{.mark} many and unwanted, and
notably include [[the **potential for miscalculation with the
West**]{.underline}]{.mark}. To avoid such a situation, [**[U.S. experts
and leaders can learn]{.mark}** much [**from** the knowledge and
experiences of **allies and partner states in
Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- countries and institutions which have
long been contending with the most aggressive forms of Russia's hybrid
warfare.

(JB)

As [**[Russia]{.mark} has evolved to increasingly [rely on hybrid
warfare]{.mark}** [as a major component of its
strategy,]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}NATO must adapt accordingly.
[**[NATO's model must shift]{.mark}** from a reliance on traditional
military deterrence and expand to incorporate political, economic, and
social spheres [to counter aggression below the level of armed
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since NATO's structure does not readily
support innovation or active (versus passive) deterrence measures, new
ideas and emphases are needed to address these challenges.

Pursuing activities to deter hybrid warfare certainly poses risks and
challenges to NATO and its member states and partners. Activities in
these spheres might risk further blurring lines between military and
nonmilitary responsibilities. Individual member laws and EU regulations
might complicate these efforts. Civil institutions could be at risk of
being identified as military targets in the event of a linear war.

Consequently, [[**Allies and partners must update their methods** to
better deter Russian aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} by reducing
Russia's strategic options and increasing their own ability to impose
costs. Imposition of costs via Allies' domains of diplomatic,
information, military, and economic levers are central to changing
Russia's cost-benefit assessment regarding hybrid warfare and enabling
deterrence. Doing [[this could be achieved through]{.underline}]{.mark}
such concepts as [comprehensive defense, **[improved IO, and expanded
allied member and partner collaboration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While
the overall goal of maintaining Alliance unity and solidarity remains
the same, the [means and ways through which Allies and partners
achieve]{.underline} that [goal should change]{.underline}. This
includes embracing the diversity of members' strengths and capabilities
and exploring increased partnerships with non-NATO members to leverage
and learn from their experience with Russian hybrid warfare aggression.

**and infrastructure [will come under]{.mark} intensifying
[cyber-attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Putin regime, which has long
used such disruptive tactics, may retaliate against Western economic
sanctions with cyber-warfare. European states and energy companies
should reflect on the laundry list of such attacks that have occurred in
recent years to recognise and respond to the risks they face in this
area.

[On 7 May 2021, the US Colonial Pipeline suffered]{.underline} a
critical ransomware cyber-attack [[resulting from a single leaked
password]{.underline}](https://www.reuters.com/business/colonial-pipeline-ceo-tells-senate-cyber-defenses-were-compromised-ahead-hack-2021-06-08/)
-- [the largest cyber-attack on infrastructure in US
history.]{.underline} This prompted the authorities to declare a state
of emergency in 17 US states along the east coast and in Washington, and
resulted in major fuel shortages and long queues at gas stations
throughout affected sectors. [By [early February 2022, a **slew of
subsequent
[cyber-attacks](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60250956)**]{.mark}
had [struck]{.mark} oil and gas facilities across [Europe,]{.mark}
[disrupting]{.mark} the operations of multiple oil transport and storage
companies in [Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands]{.mark}, and
threatening production and distribution in the sector.]{.underline}

Such attacks are possible due to three unique vulnerabilities of the
global energy ecosystem.

Firstly, this ecosystem relies on inherently complex infrastructure.
[**[Utility companies are exposed to]{.mark} relatively [high
risks]{.mark}** [because]{.mark} their]{.underline}
[[networks]{.underline}]{.mark} of both physical infrastructure and
cyber-infrastructure -- including distributors, suppliers, storage
facilities, and other assets -- [often [overlap and]{.mark} are [spread
across many countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Secondly, the digital infrastructure that supports the global energy
sector operates around the clock, with virtually no downtime.

Thirdly, [[the vulnerability]{.mark} of the global energy sector [is
**rooted in the**]{.mark} **many [motivations for attacks against
it]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As noted in a recent assessment by the
[[Canadian Centre for Cyber
Security]{.underline}](https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/cyber-threat-bulletin-cyber-threat-canadas-electricity-sector),
these include attacks carried out by states trying to achieve
geopolitical goals, by criminals attempting to extort money from
desperate companies, and by activists seeking to publicise their agendas
or oppose particular projects

Therefore, given the frequency with which these structures come under
attack and how vital they are to the economy[[, **the energy sector is a
key geopolitical battleground**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
vulnerabilities of Europe's digital security and global energy
interconnections could have a significant impact on citizens' lives. The
World Economic Forum
[[highlighted]{.underline}](https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/cyber-resilience-in-the-oil-and-gas-industry-playbook-for-boards-and-corporate-officers)
this in 2021, arguing that: "as one of the world's most sophisticated
and complex industries makes a multifaceted transition -- from analogue
to digital, from centralized to distributed and from fossil-based to
low-carbon -- [[managing cyber risk and preventing cyberthreats
are]{.mark} quickly becoming **[critical]{.mark}** to company value
chains]{.underline}."

#### France is expanding its nuclear power arsenal now

Major Nuclear Power Buildup",

(JB)

[[President Emmanuel Macron]{.mark} announced a major buildup of
France's huge nuclear power program on Thursday[, **pledging**]{.mark}
**[to construct up to 14 new-generation reactors]{.mark}** and a fleet
of smaller nuclear plants]{.underline} as the country seeks to slash
planet-warming emissions and cut its reliance on foreign energy.

The announcement represented an about-face for Mr. Macron, who had
previously pledged to reduce France's reliance on nuclear power but has
pivoted to burnishing an image as a pronuclear president battling
climate change as he faces a tough re-election bid in April.

"What our country needs is the rebirth of France's nuclear industry,"
Mr. Macron said at a nuclear turbine factory in the industrial city of
Belfort in eastern France as throngs of workers and political officials
gathered around. "[[The time has come for a nuclear
renaissance]{.underline}]{.mark}," he added.

Mr. Macron's move is seen as a pivotal moment in a growing debate over
nuclear power in Europe. The divide has [taken on new
dimensions](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/business/nuclear-power-europe-climate.html?searchResultPosition=1)

and grapple with an energy crisis that has sent prices for natural gas
and electricity surging to record highs --- in part because nuclear
energy production has fallen.

[[Mr. Macron has]{.mark} been [lead]{.mark}ing a coalition of
like-minded [countries in backing nuclear energy to speed up the push to

Climate change and the nuclear industry's potential role in it have
become a central issue in France's coming presidential election. Most
candidates, with the exception of France's Greens party, have said
[[nuclear power is needed to meet climate goals]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The nuclear industry is a national priority in France, creating about
200,000 jobs directly and indirectly.

France relies on an aging fleet of 56 nuclear reactors --- the most
after the United States, with 93 --- to generate 70 percent of its
electricity and to export energy to other countries. But France has
fallen from dominance as EDF, which has grappled with a series of
longstanding setbacks, faces a full-blown crisis just as Europe
struggles with an [energy
crunch](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/business/europe-natural-gas-prices.html?searchResultPosition=2).

[The company warned [this week]{.mark} that its [nuclear energy output
would slump to the lowest levels since the 1990s]{.mark} because of
problems at some sites]{.underline}, sending European energy prices to
fresh highs. The company has temporarily closed 10 reactors, down from
17 in December, for maintenance, including to fix cracks found in pipes
at some plants.

[The energy shortfall has [left France in the]{.mark} awkward
[position]{.mark} this winter [of leaning]{.mark} more heavily [on its
coal-fired power stations,]{.mark} tapping coal-generated electricity
from Germany and relying on natural gas imports as prices spike amid the

One key advantage that the nuclear sector has is that it is an
established industry with proven technologies and supply chains.
[[Nuclear energy]{.mark} already [displaces **1.6 gigatonnes of carbon
dioxide emissions annually**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Through
refurbishments and [long-term operation of existing
reactors](https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_60310), the nuclear sector
can continue displacing carbon dioxide for decades to come: up to 50
gigatonnes of cumulative carbon emissions between 2020 and 2050. 

There is also significant potential for [[new builds of large-scale
nuclear]{.mark} energy [reactors]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[could
displace 23 gigatonnes of emissions between 2020 and 2050 by replacing
fossil power generation]{.underline}]{.mark}. This includes replacing
coal power, which is among the most intensive emitters of carbon dioxide
but is particularly widespread in developing countries, where demand for
energy is forecast to grow quickly as more parts of their economies link
up to the electricity grid. Currently, non-OECD countries China and
India account for the biggest shares of such new projects.

As a key pillar of global decarbonisation strategies, nuclear energy
would also save money: meeting the Paris targets without nuclear energy
would cost the world an estimated USD 1.6 trillion more, [according to
the International Energy
Agency](https://www.iea.org/reports/nuclear-power-in-a-clean-energy-system).

But the nuclear sector can also play a much larger role. As countries
ramp up other types of carbon-free energy production, such as solar or
wind, nuclear power can serve as baseload that backs up renewables
and [guarantees electricity
supply](https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_34670) is constant, reliable
and dispatchable. The importance of this has become obvious from the
recent experience of some countries that have suffered power outages or
surges in energy prices. [[Where nuclear facilities are]{.mark} being
[phased]{.mark} [out]{.mark}, [governments have had to]{.mark} resort to
[restart]{.mark}ing [fossil fuel-powered plants---including
coal]{.mark}---to ensure a constant electricity supply, [taking a direct
step backwards in the fight to reduce carbon emissions and
pollution.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Major grid collapse spills over to other industries, impacting the world as a whole

**Gray 19** (Editor Richard Gray leads BBC Future\'s editorial and
commercial strategy), 8/24/19, accessed 6/28/22, " What Would Happen in
an Apocalyptic Blackout",
<https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191023-what-would-happen-in-an-apocalyptic-blackout>
(JB)

She is right. While the term "black sky" events illustrates perhaps the
most visible impact of widespread power failures, it fails to convey the
scale of the impact these can have. In our modern world, [**almost
everything**, from our financial systems to our communication networks,
are **utterly reliant upon electricity**. Other critical infrastructure
like water supplies and our sewer systems rely upon electric powered
pumps to keep them running. With no power, fuel pumps at petrol stations
stop working, road signs, traffic lights and train systems go dead.
Transport networks grind to a halt.]{.underline}

[Our complex food supply chains quickly fall apart without computers to
coordinate where produce needs to be, or the fuel to transport it or
refrigeration to preserve it. Air conditioning, gas boilers and heating
systems also rely upon electricity to work.]{.underline}

A little over 100 years ago, our cities ran on human and animal muscle
power to ferry goods and waste around. Modern infrastructure is now
utterly reliant upon electricity.

"In today's world, [our systems are highly interdependent]{.underline}
and it is very hard to find many systems that are not fundamentally
reliant upon power," says Mian. "**[A black sky scenario will affect
everyone]{.underline}**."

The causes of a black sky event are many. They vary from natural
disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes to [geomagnetic storms
triggered by enormous flares from the
Sun](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/impacts), or coronal mass ejections, that
send a barrage of electrically charged particles racing across the Solar
System and [can overload electrical
grids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146516306433).
One intense geomagnetic disturbance caused [a nine-hour outage across
large areas of Canada in
1989](https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/sun_darkness.html).

The Electric Infrastructure Security Council, an international body that
reviews threats to power grids, also [lists a number of human threats
that can trigger a mass black
out](https://www.eiscouncil.org/BlackSky.aspx). These include
cyberterrorism attacks or coordinated physical assaults on energy
infrastructure such as power stations, and electromagnetic pulses that
can disable electricity grids.

"Our national power grids are tremendous feats of engineering and
operations that have supported rapid economic growth around the world,"
say Melissa Lott, a research fellow at the Center on Global Energy
Policy at Columbia University in New York. "But more investment is
needed if electric power grids are going to keep up with rapid
technology shifts and increasingly extreme weather events."

She says that while true black sky events are mercifully rare, the deep
impact they have on businesses and people means more needs to not only
update grid technology and management, but also improve infrastructure
so it can be more resilient against physical threats like flooding.

"In the summer of 2012, blackouts in India cut power to more than 600
million people over two days. In Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria crippled
infrastructure across the island, leaving people in the dark and
triggering a humanitarian crisis. In 2018, an earthquake on Japan's
Hokkaido island left more than 5 million people without power. In order
to keep these events from becoming more common and to minimise their
impact, we need to invest in our grids."

Putting measures in place to counter all of these potential threats is
difficult and expensive. Critical systems can be guarded from human
attacks and they can be shielded from electromagnetic pulses with enough
money being spent on them. Building new systems for [protecting
transformers from coronal mass
ejections](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146516306433)
can also help to keep systems safe.

But there are some events that cannot be planned for and the complex,
interconnected nature of our electricity grids are remarkably
vulnerable. [Take what happened in September 2003 when a fallen tree
brought down a power line in Switzerland's Lukmanier Pass over the Alps
into Italy and 24 minutes later another tree came down onto a line in
the nearby Great St Bernard pass. The sudden failure of these two key
lines caused other connections to Europe's electricity network to trip,
which triggered]{.underline} [power plants across Italy to shut
down](http://www.rae.gr/old/cases/C13/italy/UCTE_rept.pdf)[. **The whole
of Italy was left without power because of two fallen trees starting a
cascade of events.**]{.underline}

Modern electricity grids are increasingly interconnected and
complicated, making failures like this difficult to predict. [Most of
Europe now runs off]{.underline} [a massive interconnected power
grid](https://www.entsoe.eu/data/map/) -- probably the largest in the
world -- that supplies more than 400 million customers in 24 countries.
The USA is made up of five different grids.

But there are some that are seeking ways of anticipating potential power
failures and are enlisting the help of artificial intelligence to help
them grapple with this highly complex problem.

[When a power plant goes down, for example, it causes an abrupt spike in
load on others on the network, which in turn slows down the generators
at these plants and causes the frequency held on the grid to
decrease]{.underline}. This risks destabilising the delicate balance
that electricity grids are held in, and [**operators have to deploy
countermeasures rapidly -- often within milliseconds** -- to prevent
sections of the grid being cut off.]{.underline}

#### 1. We meet: DoD cybersecurity strategy includes defense through OCOs

Erica D. **Lonergan 20,** Assistant Professor in the Army Cyber
Institute, PhD in Political Science from Columbia University,
"Operationalizing Defend Forward", Lawfare, 03/12/2020, accessed
6/24/2022,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/operationalizing-defend-forward-how-concept-works-change-adversary-behavior.

[Defend forward is a crucial component of the Cyberspace Solarium
Commission's strategic concept of layered cyber deterrence]{.underline},
particularly in terms of defend forward's role in creating costs for
adversaries conducting malicious behavior in cyberspace. [The commission
reimagines defend forward,]{.underline} originally articulated in the
2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, as a whole-of-nation concept.
That said, here I will focus on the logic of defend forward in its
military application and detail how the concept should be
operationalized. [[Defend forward,]{.mark} as defined by the commission,
[entails]{.mark} the [proactive]{.mark} [observing, pursuing, and
countering of adversary operations and]{.mark} imposing costs in
day-to-day competition to disrupt and defeat ongoing malicious adversary
cyber campaigns, deter future campaigns, and reinforce favorable
international norms of behavior, using all the instruments of national
power.]{.underline} This piece traces the emergence of the logic of
defend forward and describes how the commission built on existing
concepts to more fully articulate defend forward's theory of victory and
how defend forward seeks to accomplish desired end states.

Defend forward, as a strategic concept, grew out of a number of related
realizations about the strategic environment in cyberspace. First,
[Defense Department entities governed under Title 10 of the U.S. Code
have to be able to more routinely operate outside of the department's
own networks]{.underline}, known as the Department of Defense
Information Network. Adversary operations span global cyberspace because
the environment is not defined by geographic boundaries or even shared
understandings about how sovereignty applies in this domain. [If the
Defense Department's ability to operate outside of its own networks was
more limited and circumscribed, as envisioned in the 2015 Department of
Defense Cyber Strategy, the department would be giving free reign to
adversary actors that traverse global networks constrained only by
capabilities.]{.underline}

Second, [**[intelligence collection in cyberspace]{.mark} against an
adversary [cannot be conducted]{.mark} solely [through static, passive
]{.mark}**[collection. Observing adversaries]{.mark} as they
maneuver---and understanding their evolving organizations, capabilities,
techniques and personas---[requires the **U.S., or its allies**]{.mark}
**and partners,** [to gain access to netwo­­­rks]{.mark} and systems where
adversaries operate]{.underline}. The challenge is that this
infrastructure is owned by some entity, whether by the U.S. government,
private companies or individuals, allied and partner governments, or the
adversary. In other words, unlike in other domains, there are no "high
seas" or "international waters" in cyberspace. It is important to
acknowledge this reality and be transparent about its implications for
how the U.S. can and should operate to achieve defensive strategic
objectives consistent with international law.

Third, [to rapidly generate effects in cyberspace at the desired time,
forces and capabilities have to routinely operate where the adversary
is]{.underline}. In cyberspace, a decision-maker cannot simply call for
fires and reliably anticipate that the desired effect will be delivered
against the intended target at the right time. [**[Cyber
operations]{.mark} and campaigns [demand]{.mark} operational
[preparation of the environment; prior intel]{.mark}ligence [collection
and operations to identify vulnerabilities]{.mark} and** exploits; the
development or procurement of tools to deliver the intended effects; and
the ability to hold targets at risk over time]{.underline} to deliver
the appropriate effect on a decision-maker's request. Relatedly,
capabilities are dynamic---today's tools may be irrelevant
tomorrow---and opportunities are fleeting---today's access may be gone
by tomorrow. Therefore, maintaining cyber capabilities and forces in
reserve cedes the initiative to adversaries.

The above understanding coalesced into a new Defense Department strategy
anchored in the defend forward concept. Its operationalization, as
demonstrated by U.S. efforts to counter Russian interference in the 2018
U.S. midterm elections, was enhanced by further changes to policymaking
processes, the delegation of authorities and law. But the Cyberspace
Solarium Commission recognized that further work remained to be done to
parse the strategic logic of defend forward, identify its desired end
states, and trace the causal processes that link its implementation with
those objectives.

The commission addresses a central question posed by defend forward: How
can the U.S. positively change adversary behavior in cyberspace short of
war to produce a more favorable status quo in the short to medium term,
while cultivating stability in the international system over the long
term?

This question implies a number of desired end states. The first is to
change the status quo for activities below the level of war, in which
adversaries operate in and through cyberspace to contest U.S. interests
on a routine basis. Specifically, **[[defend forward]{.mark} seeks to
[reduce the magnitude and effects of malicious adversary
behavior]{.mark}, recognizing it is impossible to stop or prevent all
unwanted activities.]{.underline}** The second is to maintain the status
quo regarding managing within- and cross-domain escalation dynamics.
[The U.S. should be able to preserve deterrence of cyberattacks of
significant consequence, while being able to employ cyber capabilities
below the level of armed attack without triggering significant adversary
retaliation or escalation.]{.underline} Third, over the long term,
[defend forward aims to contribute to the establishment and enforcement
of favorable international norms of behavior.]{.underline} Norms do
exist in cyberspace, but not all are consistent with U.S. interests and
values.

#### NATO already announced climate initiatives at Madrid Summit in the face of other priorities

**The National News 6/28** (Thomas Harding, "Climate change to shape
Nato\'s security policy after Madrid summit," The National News US,
6/28/2022,

-LH

[**NATO has responded to pressure to meet the challenge presented by
climate change** to world security by **pledging to cut its civilian and
military greenhouse gas emissions** by at least 45 per cent by
2030.]{.underline}

Secretary General [Jens Stoltenberg]{.underline} on Tuesday [said
alliance operations would be carbon neutral by 2050, as he **announced
the first emissions targets** for the organisation.]{.underline}

\"It will not be easy but it can be done,\" he said at the Nato summit
in Madrid. \"[All allies are committed to reducing their greenhouse gas
emissions **as part of the Paris agreement**]{.underline}. [Adapting
their militaries will contribute to this,]{.underline} including more
green tech, such as renewables, climate-friendly synthetic fuels and
more energy efficient solutions.\"

A report from a British think tank said it was "imperative" that the
summit addressed Nato's role in providing climate solutions, especially
as rising temperatures across in the Middle East and North Africa would
have ramifications for security in Europe.

"The Mena region risks being particularly impacted and is in Europe's
neighbourhood," Chatham House said.

"Although recent Nato interventions in the region have been limited to
operations in Libya, Afghanistan and Iraq, further instability due to
climate change on Nato's southern flank could be the tipping point to
develop a much-needed coherent strategy for supporting stabilisation and
peacebuilding efforts in the Sahel and beyond."

Madrid summit discussions were due to open on Tuesday with an address on
climate change and alliance security from Iceland's Prime Minister
Katrin Jakobsdottir.

The Chatham House paper urged Nato to prioritise climate change because
it can become a "threat multiplier" with increased mass migration,
weakening governments and food and water scarcity.

"It is imperative the summit and the new Strategic Concept \[statement
of the alliance\'s values\] lay the groundwork for Nato's sustained role
in tackling climate change-induced security challenges," it said.

Climate change threatens strategic interests by exacerbating problems,
which can "ultimately contribute to conflict".

As Nato prepares to issue its first Climate Change and Security Progress
Report in Madrid, it was "crucial this maintains the same level of
determination to prepare the alliance for climate-related instability",
Chatham House said.

Another report, by the International Military Council on Climate and
Security, highlighted the "high operational costs" of fossil fuel use by
militaries.

It recommended that Nato states procure and develop equipment with low
carbon emissions.

"We have passed the point of debating whether or not climate change is
also a matter of national security," said Gen Tom Middendorp, chairman
of IMCCS and former chief of defence for the Netherlands.

"It is time to develop solutions. The security sector has a role to play
in forecasting the security effects of climate change and in the areas
of mitigation and adaptation."

Last year, Nato figures suggested the carbon emissions from a 60-tonne
US Abrams main battle tank were the equivalent of 10 Mercedes-Benz cars.

Mr Stoltenberg has urged militaries to look at how they can power tanks
and jets with alternative energy sources, such as solar panels, to
reduce its carbon emissions.

"Nato should do its part to look into how we can reduce emissions from
military operations," he told a Chatham House event in 2021.

"We know that heavy battle tanks or fighter jets and naval ships consume
a lot of fossil fuel and emit greenhouse gases and therefore we have to
look into how we can reduce those emissions by alternative fuels, solar
panels or other ways of running our missions."

[Reducing dependence on fossil fuels would help to eliminate a
vulnerability common to many operations, where long supply lines are
used take fuel to the front line, Mr Stoltenberg said.]{.underline}

BRUSSELS --- After the collapse of the Soviet Union, some asked whether
NATO had any real reason to exist. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine gave
new urgency to NATO as a defensive alliance aimed at deterring Moscow.

Now, at its annual summit meeting this week in Madrid, leaders of the
[30 members of NATO are set to agree on **the most significant overhaul
of the alliance's defenses** since the Cold War.]{.underline}

[There will be a **large increase in the number of troops** assigned to
defend NATO's eastern flank,]{.underline} closest to Russia and Belarus,
[with a major commitment to position heavy military equipment
there]{.underline}, like tanks and artillery, that would bolster an
allied response to any Russian threat or aggression.

[There will also be **statements of unity on Ukraine**]{.underline},
despite internal debates within the alliance on how long the war will
take, how it will end and its mounting costs to NATO and European
allies.

"The summit will show western solidarity as we go into a period of high
gas prices and food scarcity, with Russia willing now to use both as
weapons of war," said Kori Schake, director of foreign and defense
policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. "So we know that
and can still hang together."

[At the same time, she said, debates about the future are rumbling among
member countries]{.underline}. "The lesson the U.S. is tempted to take
away from Ukraine is the incapacity of the Russian military, suggesting
that Europe should be able to handle the burden of European security,"
Ms. Schake said. "But the European lesson is that unless the U.S. is at
the center of the Western response, there will be no Western response,
so they're trying to lock in American involvement."

[In Madrid, the alliance will also approve its **first updated mission
statement in 12 years**, portraying a world of new perils, with
**threats not just from Russia but also China**]{.underline}, an
American priority, [and from new forms of warfare ranging from **cyber
and artificial intelligence to disinformation and restrictions on
energy, food and rare minerals**.]{.underline}

The mission statement, known as the strategic concept, frames defense
planning, spending and resource allocation throughout the alliance. It
sounds arcane but has been hotly debated, with France and Germany
insisting on describing a rising China as a "challenge" to the
trans-Atlantic security order, not as a "threat," as Russia has clearly
become.

[There will also be discussion on how to convince Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
the president of Turkey, to remove his effective **veto over the
applications of Sweden and Finland** to join NATO]{.underline}, a matter
that inevitably will have to involve President Biden.

[One of the other key debates during the summit]{.underline}, which runs
from Tuesday evening through Thursday[, will be the **issue of new NATO
troops along the eastern flank**]{.underline} --- how many, how they are
deployed, and how permanent they will be.

As the war in Ukraine has proceeded, NATO has established four more
multinational battalion-sized groups in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and
Slovakia, to add to the ones already established in 2017 --- following
Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 --- in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania
and Poland.

The Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are pressing for
larger permanent deployments, to move from the current "tripwire"
defense --- the roughly 1,500 rotating NATO troops in each country ---
to "deterrence by denial," which would involve more permanent
deployments of up to a division of American troops, as Estonia has been
demanding.

They want the larger deployments to better defend all NATO territory
from any conflict at its very start, fearing that they would be quickly
overrun by Russian forces otherwise.

The secretary-general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, said recently that
allies could agree "to strengthen battle groups in the east up to
brigade level," which would bring them to between 3,000 and 5,000
troops.

A permanent American division is not in the cards. Mr. Biden is expected
to announce new deployments of another one or two brigade combat teams
to bring the assigned level of American troops in Europe to about
100,000, up from some 70,000 before the Russian invasion, NATO officials
said.

But they are likely to be kept in Germany and Poland, ready to move in
times of threat or conflict to pre-assigned countries where they will
also train with pre-positioned equipment.

[Other NATO allies are increasing their deployments, too]{.underline},
with Germany announcing the addition of 500 troops to its forces in the
multinational battlegroup it leads in Lithuania, plus the pre-assignment
of some 3,000 more troops in case of trouble.

There has been criticism from the Baltic nations that those troops will
be stationed in Germany. But the German government and other allies
argue that it is too expensive to build permanent barracks and schools
to house troops and their families in other countries when they can
arrive quickly to the battlefield from established bases in places like
Germany.

"They argue that you need large forces in the country like a Maginot
line to prevent them from being overrun early in a conflict," said Ivo
Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and head of the Chicago
Council on Global Affairs, referring to the Baltic countries. "But
that's not the best way to defend them, because these countries are too
small for real, regular training, which you can do in Poland or Germany.
Better to have them there and constantly train them and rotate them
regularly."

The issue is now more sensitive, with Moscow accusing Lithuania of
blocking its rail shipments to its heavily armed enclave of Kaliningrad
in line with E.U. sanctions against Russia, and threatening reprisals.
Lithuanian and European officials say there is no blockade against the
enclave, which is on the Baltic Sea, sandwiched between Poland and
Lithuania. But the narrow strip of some 60 miles between Belarus and
Kaliningrad, known as the Suwalki Gap, is considered vulnerable.

The anxiety among the Baltic countries is justified, said Ms. Schake. "I
would want more NATO deployments too if I were them, because they live
exposed," she said. "For smaller countries, proximity to a Russia that
would negate Ukraine is scary."

Since the start of the war, NATO has activated its "response force," now
40,000 troops, under NATO command. Mr. Stoltenberg said on Monday that
the force would be expanded to 300,000. It is expected to be rebranded
as the Allied Response Force, and will include more troops based in
their home countries but pre-assigned to the eastern flank if needed.

Mr. Daalder sees another fault line in the different perceptions of the
Russian threat among NATO members. Some, especially in former
Soviet-bloc nations, believe that "Russia has fundamentally changed
everything and we're back to a Cold War alliance, and we have to hold
the line from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea," he said, referring to
NATO's northern and southern reaches.

And there are other members of the alliance, including the United
States, Italy and Spain, which say [there are other important threats
too --- from **terrorism, climate change and mass migration**. And then
there is **China's inexorable rise** as a technically advanced rival
seeking global influence.]{.underline}

[**There is also the question of how big NATO should be** --- not just
in light of the potential addition of Finland and Sweden, but also its
2008 promise that Ukraine and Georgia would one day be full
members]{.underline}, Mr. Daalder said. Both the European Union and NATO
have now promised Ukraine paths to membership, but have been vague about
that commitment. "I don't think NATO can just walk away from it in
Madrid, as some would like," he said.

[And as ever, there will be **debates about increases in military
spending**, about NATO's own budget]{.underline} and about
burden-sharing, not only between the United States and its allies but
between the European Union and NATO.

Christopher Skaluba, a security expert at the Scowcroft Center for
Strategy and Security of the Atlantic Council, said that "following the
money at NATO is always a smart idea." NATO allies make commitments,
"but they're easier to say than do, and inflation makes everything more
expensive," he said.

"The cost of failing to deter Russia from going into Ukraine is very
high, and we're all paying the price for it, the Ukrainians most of
all," Mr. Skaluba said. The pressure to walk back from the alliance's
commitments, he said, "will be real, too."

#### Variety of agenda items plus climate goals for upcoming Madrid summit proves NATO can focus on many things at once

**Anadolu Agency 6/27** (Beyza Binnur Donmez, "What to expect from
NATO\'s Madrid summit," Anadolu Agecy, 6/27/2022,
<https://www.aa.com.tr/en/politics/what-to-expect-from-natos-madrid-summit/2623259)->
LH

MADRID Leaders of NATO\'s member countries and key partners are set to
meet in Madrid to discuss issues facing the alliance during a three-day
summit beginning on Tuesday.

Russia\'s war against Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe as it caused
far-reaching energy and food crises by shaking the rules of the
international order since it began on Feb. 24.

As NATO became a more indispensable platform for transatlantic
cooperation on security and defense, [allies will continue to make
decisions to keep the alliance ready against any threat at the
summit]{.underline}.

[Strengthening NATO\'s long-term **deterrence and defense**, sustaining
support for **Ukraine**, launching NATO\'s 2022 Strategic Concept,
**reinforcing partnerships** and maintaining an open door**, adapting to
threats and challenges** from any direction, and **transatlantic unity
and alliance solidarity will be on the agenda** for the member states to
discuss.]{.underline}

Some [\"important\" topics to be discussed by members and partners
include how **has Russia\'s military operation in Ukraine and the new
security reality** in Europe affected the alliance\'s approach to
deterrence and defense]{.underline}; [what is NATO doing to address
challenges like **China\'s growing influence**]{.underline} or security
consequences of climate change and what to include in the next Strategic
Concept.

To protect and defend allied territory amid the current security
reality, NATO has more than 40,000 troops under direct command, backed
by air and naval assets.

The alliance also doubled the number of battlegroups to eight, extending
from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south.

[NATO leaders will \"significantly strengthen the Alliance\'s posture
for the long term, with more presence, capabilities and
readiness,\"]{.underline} according to the alliance, [which will
**require adequate resources and continued investment**]{.underline} in
defense.

Support for Ukraine Noting that [allies \"significantly stepped up with
billions of euros\' worth\" of additional lethal and non-lethal aid to
help Ukraine]{.underline} after Russia launched its war in February,
NATO said it builds on the years of NATO training and assistance since
Moscow\'s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Leaders of member countries will meet with Ukraine to agree to step up
and sustain support for the \"longer-term\" at the summit.

2022 Strategic Concept Serving as a blueprint for future adaption,
strategic concepts give the alliance the ability to respond to current
security challenges and guide political and military developments for
the challenges of tomorrow.

In Madrid, [leaders will endorse **a 2022 Strategic Concept**, which
will set out NATO\'s joint positions, including on Russia and emerging
challenges, and will address China]{.underline} for the first time.

\"The Madrid Strategic Concept will reflect the new security
environment, recommit to our values, and reaffirm our unity, ensuring
that our Alliance is fit for the future,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg said of the new concept.

The concept has been reviewed and updated approximately every 10 years
since the end of the Cold War. The last one was adopted at the Lisbon
Summit in 2010.

Reinforcing partnerships, maintaining an open door

[**Finland and Sweden\'s NATO bids** will belong to the main agenda
points of the summit as part of the alliance\'s Open Door
policy]{.underline}.

Sweden and Finland formally applied to join the alliance last month, a
decision spurred by Russia\'s war on Ukraine.

[But Türkiye, a longstanding member of the alliance, has voiced
objections to the membership bids]{.underline}, criticizing the
countries for tolerating and even supporting terrorist groups.

Stoltenberg has constantly said that Türkiye has \"legitimate concerns
related to their fight against the PKK a group and other
organizations,\" and that the PKK is considered a terror organization by
NATO, the EU, Finland, and Sweden.

However, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares recently said the
host country hopes to sign with Finland and Sweden at the summit as
parties could get closer in talks during the one-week window.

In its more than 35-year terror campaign against Türkiye, the PKK has
been responsible for the deaths of more than 40,000 people.

[NATO will step up **support to Georgia and other partners** to build
their capabilities and strengthen their resilience during the
summit]{.underline}.

The leaders of four Asia-Pacific partners \-- Australia, Japan, the
Republic of Korea and New Zealand will be part of a NATO summit for the
first time.

Adapting to threats, challenges [Member countries are set to make
**decisions to maintain NATO\'s technological edge**, \"including
through the new Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic
and a billion euro Innovation Fund]{.underline}, to support start-ups
and develop cutting-edge solutions to security challenges,\" according
to the alliance.

[Terrorism, cyberattacks, China\'s \"coercive\" policies, disruptive
technologies and the **security impact of climate change** are among the
topics that the alliance will focus under threats and challenges
title.]{.underline}

[Regarding climate change, leaders will agree on a new methodology to
map military greenhouse gas emissions and a target to help NATO
contribute to the goal of net-zero emissions]{.underline}.

As NATO faces \"the most serious security situation in decades,\" the
decisions leaders make in Madrid will ensure that NATO continues to
preserve \"peace, prevent conflict and protect our people and our
values,\" according to the alliance.

The summit has special importance for Spain as the country is hosting on
the 40th anniversary of Madrid\'s accession to NATO.

### 2AC -- NUQ

#### Bill won't pass -- [Extensive]{.underline} big tech lobbying and competing priorities [effectively]{.underline} deter lawmakers

**Zakrzewski et al. 6/27**/22 -- Cat Zakrzewski, Will Oremus, Gerrit De
Vynck and Cristiano Lima (\"With clock ticking, battle over tech
regulation intensifies\"; Washington Post;
https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/27/antitrust-tech-battle-congress/;
6-27-2022, Accessed 6-28-2022)//ILake-AZ

The left-leaning advocacy group Fight for the Future watched as [tech
companies blanketed the airwaves with ads urging millions to tell their
senators to block major antitrust bills winding their way through
Congress]{.underline}. Trying to make the most of its significantly
smaller budget for counter messaging, the advocacy group decided to
target one person: Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer.

Over the weekend, [the group drove billboard trucks with 12-foot-wide
screens to Schumer's homes in New York and Washington,]{.underline}
blaring a video of comedian John Oliver urging Congress to pass the
legislation.

The decision to target Schumer was a simple one, said Evan Greer, Fight
for the Future's director: "He is the key. ... This was a way to get
creative and put this right in his face."

Friends and foes alike of the landmark legislation, two bills that seek
to rein in the business practices of the country's largest tech
companies, have their eyes on Schumer, who will decide whether the
legislation will make it to the Senate floor for a vote.

In recent days, it's not just proponents of the bills who have sought to
sway Schumer. [The leaders of Google and Amazon have personally called
the Senate majority leader.]{.underline} His office said he tells anyone
who calls him to discuss the legislation the same message: "Senator
Schumer supports the legislation and is working with Senator \[Amy\]
Klobuchar and others to get the necessary votes to pass it," said
Schumer spokesman Justin Goodman.

It's a wonky yet momentous political battle that has united an unlikely
alliance of would-be trustbusters from left and right against some of
the wealthiest corporations in world history. With time running out for
this Congress to pass them, those [corporations are putting up the
political fight of their lives.]{.underline}

[Facebook quietly bankrolled small, grass-roots groups to fight its
battles]{.underline} in Washington

Three years in the making, the legislation would prohibit the largest
online platforms from tilting the playing field toward their own goods
and services, its proponents say. But the [tech companies say it would
do far more than that, squelching innovation and giving a leg up to
their rivals in China. They aren't shy about claiming a **national
security** threat.]{.underline}

The [titans of the industry have mobilized like **never before** to
combat it]{.underline}. [Google CEO]{.underline} Sundar Pichai
[personally called Schumer]{.underline} during a visit to Washington
last week. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been making personal calls to
Schumer and other lawmakers, Politico first reported earlier this month.
And Apple CEO Tim Cook made his own trip to Capitol Hill earlier this
month.

Meanwhile, [industry-backed groups have been pouring tens of millions of
dollars into an anti-regulation campaign, blasting ads on TVs and social
media feeds across the country that warn Americans the tech bills will
break popular services like Amazon Prime and Google Maps.]{.underline}
[The groups have already spent \$72 million on ads this
year]{.underline}, according to an analysis from the ad tracking firm
AdImpact. Nearly half of that money was spent in June alone.

"Spending \$72 million is a drop in the bucket," said Rep. David N.
Cicilline (D-R.I.), who authored the House legislation and led a
bipartisan investigation into the companies. "These companies have
billions and billions of reasons to oppose the legislation and maintain
the status quo."

The focus on Schumer has intensified after the segment on Oliver's show,
which is known for bringing mainstream attention to complex policy
issues. In the segment, Oliver zeroed in on Schumer particularly, noting
that he has not yet brought the bills for a floor vote. He also mentions
previous media reports that show that [17 members of Congress have
children who work]{.underline} or recently have worked [at large tech
companies, **including Schumer's daughters**]{.underline} who work as a
marketing manager at Meta and a registered lobbyist for Amazon.

Yet **[there are key holdouts in both parties]{.underline}**. Though two
key tech antitrust bills passed through committee earlier this year with
strong bipartisan support, [members of both parties indicated they had
**outstanding concerns** that would need to be addressed before a floor
vote. Schumer's resolve to pass them is **in question** amid a bevy of
competing priorities.]{.underline}

Senate advances antitrust legislation, despite [reservations from
California Democrats]{.underline}

The clock is ticking. The legislation has support from the left, right
and center, a rare alliance that will likely dissolve after the midterm
elections, said William E. Kovacic, former Republican chair of the
Federal Trade Commission and a professor at George Washington University
Law School who studies antitrust and competition.

"Simply put, this may be the best chance the advocates of new
legislation ever get to realize their aims for reform," Kovacic said.

For more than three years, through a pandemic, two impeachments and an
insurrection, lawmakers and their staffs have systematically collected
evidence that Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook engaged in
anticompetitive tactics to solidify their dominance across the internet.
They've hosted high-profile hearings with the companies' CEOs, and
pushed bills through House and Senate committees with bipartisan votes.
And they heard from the CEOs of smaller tech firms, including Sonos,
Spotify and Tile, who testified that the giants had leveraged the power
of their platforms to give their own apps and products unfair advantages
over independent rivals.

The congressional probe found that the four companies control essential
portals to the digital economy --- and increasingly use those platforms
to offer their own products and features, competing with the same
businesses that rely on them. Critics say that's a glaring conflict of
interest; the tech giants say it's for their customers' own good.

Breaking up the companies isn't on the table in the current antitrust
package, which focuses on regulating tech companies' treatment of
rivals. Still, [the bills mark the closest Washington has yet come to
comprehensive regulation of a U.S. tech industry that includes four of
the world's five **most valuable publicly traded
companies**]{.underline}.

The key bills --- the American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the
Open App Markets Act --- have been languishing in Congress for months,
and [their chances of becoming law grow dimmer the closer Congress gets
to the midterms, when lawmakers' attention will turn to
campaigning]{.underline}. [Democrats risk losing control of Congress in
that election]{.underline}, and significant tech antitrust bills are
viewed as unlikely to pass under Republican leadership.

In an interview Friday[, Cicilline said it's "very important" that the
legislation comes to a floor vote]{.underline} before Congress leaves
for its August recess.

"Every day we wait, we are doing significant harm to the ability of
small businesses to survive," Cicilline said.

The fate of lawmakers' tech antitrust push may hinge on one bill

[The legislation's supporters are up against a **host of competing
political priorities**, as Democrats and the Biden administration
scramble to address gun control, inflation, climate policy and the
Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade.]{.underline}

Cicilline says that lawmakers have the votes to pass the legislation,
and the tech executives' recent visits to Washington reflect how worried
they are. Pichai also met with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who had
previously raised concerns that the bills would single out companies in
her home state. He also met with Republican lawmakers including Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Whip John Thune
(R-S.D.) and Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), said multiple people familiar
with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss
private meetings. Representatives for McConnell, Daines and Thune did
not respond to a request for comment.

In meetings with Republican lawmakers, [Pichai warned that the antitrust
bills would be bad for innovation]{.underline}. However, the
conservative lawmakers were focused on accusations that the company's
email system is politically biased. Pichai also discussed the company's
interest in federal privacy legislation and a key chip subsidies bill,
one person said.

"We regularly engage with lawmakers and regulators on a range of issues
and to be helpful with their efforts around economic growth, small
business support, immigration, cybersecurity, and protecting online
information, among other issues," José Castañeda, a Google spokesman,
said in a statement.

He also said that the company does not filter email based on political
affiliation and said that it was working to increase transparency data
about bulk sending.

[A multimillion-dollar campaign is **pushing Dems to ditch antitrust
reform**]{.underline}

[Industry groups are pushing the message to policymakers that tech
regulation is **not a top priority** for voters in the 2022 political
environment.]{.underline} [Chamber of Progress,]{.underline} a
left-leaning group funded by Amazon, Apple and Google, [has distributed
polling to congressional offices that suggests voters in key
battleground states]{.underline} like Arizona and Nevada [see tech
regulation as a significantly lower priority]{.underline} than taming
inflation or protecting the border.

The [groups have]{.underline} also [targeted their ad blitz in states
where Democrats face key elections]{.underline}, including Georgia,
Nevada, Arizona and Colorado, according to the AdImpact data. [The ads
play on Americans' concerns about inflation]{.underline}, and suggest
that the legislation could break Amazon Prime's guarantee of two-day
delivery and bust services that Google offers free.

"Families are getting squeezed by rising prices, and now [Congress is
considering a bill that could make things worse for millions of
Americans," says an ad]{.underline} from the Computer and Communications
Industry Association, which is backed by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and
Google. [The ads then urge people to call their senators to press them
to vote "no" on the antitrust measure.]{.underline}

Cicilline argues that by creating more competition, the legislation
would help address the economic conditions contributing to inflation.

[Industry groups]{.underline} have also sought to torpedo the bills by
[playing on partisan divisions over tech regulation]{.underline}. The
Chamber of Progress is running digital [ads suggesting that the
antitrust legislation would make it harder for companies to remove
violence and misinformation]{.underline}. The ads link to a petition
that asserts the bill could prohibit Amazon from taking down
anti-vaccine documentaries or could have stopped Apple from booting
Parler from the App Store in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection.

Cicilline called these arguments "completely false," saying there is
nothing in the bill that would prevent companies from upholding
standards for content across their services.

Tech groups and executives have also sought to shift the focus to
privacy rather than competition policy, especially after a trio of key
lawmakers reached a deal on privacy legislation[.
Netchoice]{.underline}, an industry trade group with funding from Google
and Facebook, [has been telling lawmakers that privacy is a bigger
priority for voters than antitrust]{.underline}, said spokesman Rob
Winterton. During his recent visit to Washington, Cook sent a letter to
lawmakers urging them to "advance comprehensive privacy legislation as
soon as possible."

House and Senate members unveil stalled data privacy bill

[The pro-regulation groups have also been spending --- through **far
less** than their Big Tech counterparts.]{.underline}

The Fight for the Future trucks broadcasting John Oliver around New York
and Washington cost about \$30,000. The Tech Oversight Project says it
will spend about \$250,000 by the end of June on ads supporting the
legislation, also targeting states where Democrats face challenging
races in the fall.

A coalition of smaller tech companies, civil society groups and
nonprofits have launched their own response, pressing lawmakers to
swiftly move on the legislation ahead of the midterms. That included
last-minute trips to Capitol Hill by the CEOs of Kelkoo, a European
price comparison site, and Proton AG, a Swiss-based company that
provides an encrypted email service.

Proton CEO Andy Yen, who made his first trip to Capitol Hill as CEO to
lobby in favor of the bills last week, said the policy debate has long
been "dominated by the big tech companies."

#### Antitrust [won't pass]{.underline} -- big tech pressure [significantly]{.underline} surpasses Congressional resources [and]{.underline} democrats are [increasingly]{.underline} concerned for Midterms

of politics, technology and society (Hirsh Chitkara; \"Antitrust

Antitrust\'s feeble optimism

Yesterday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," Sen. Amy Klobuchar tried to strike
an optimistic note on the fate of the long-awaited American Innovation
and Choice Online Act. "I believe we're going to pass this," she said of
the bill, which aims to prevent Big Tech platforms from giving
preference to their own products. Klobuchar also reiterated Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's promise to put the "strongly bipartisan
bill" to a vote by early summer.

So what still needs to happen for the bill to pass? It already went
through House and Senate subcommittees, so the [next step would be for
Schumer to call a floor vote.]{.underline} In February, the White House
came out in support of the congressional antitrust push, so President
Biden would sign the bill into law --- if it gets that far.

[Big Tech is doubling down on efforts to kill the bill,]{.underline} and
that hasn't escaped Klobuchar's notice. Despite insisting that the bill
will pass, Klobuchar acknowledged that her camp faces unprecedented
resistance from the Big Tech lobby.

"I have never seen anything like this," she said. "They are bullies.
They're making stuff up --- making things up left and right that aren't
true."

This came in response to host Joe Scarborough referencing the
anti-antitrust advertising campaign, which he called "outright
propaganda." Klobuchar said [firms spent \$21 million in ad-buy against
the bill just in the past week]{.underline}. Earlier reports showed the
[Amazon- and Alphabet-backed Computer and Communications Industry
Association allocated \$8.4 million for TV ads targeting midterm swing
states such as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire and
Wisconsin.]{.underline}

The [antitrust advocates are severely outmatched when it comes to legal
resourcing]{.underline}. Klobuchar said the [tech firms have hired
"**thousands of lawyers and lobbyists**," as compared to the **two**
lawyers on her team.]{.underline}

[Big Tech's efforts are apparently **working** --- Democrats just won't
publicly admit it.]{.underline}

[Behind closed doors, Democratic senators have **complained to Schumer**
that forcing an early summer antitrust vote would reduce their chances
in midterms, according to POLITICO reporting from May.]{.underline}

[If the votes aren't there]{.underline}, Schumer would likely decline to
bring the bill to the floor. [That would help Democrats save face, at
least relative to publicly **voting against an antitrust bill** that has
been a pillar of their agenda for years]{.underline}.

It would also almost certainly doom the bill. [Democrats are **projected
to lose big in midterms**, so "delaying" a vote really means giving
up.]{.underline}

The [Jan. 6 House committee hearings might be the final nail in the
coffin]{.underline}. Would it be nice if D.C. could walk and chew gum at
the same time? Of course. But if we're being honest, that's not always
how things work on the Hill. The Jan. 6 committee hearings will be a
media circus, drawing a lot of media attention away from the antitrust
bill. The literal "prime time" event kicks off tomorrow and could go all
the way until November. It's supposed to rally support for Democrats
ahead of midterms; ironically, [it could just make those reelection
efforts more difficult by taking away what was supposed to be the
signature legislative win for the term.]{.underline}

customers.]{.underline}

Moreover, [583 million people in China pay with their phones---more than
the total U.S. population.]{.underline} [The country has been able to
kick-start a mobile payment and e-commerce revolution]{.underline}
thanks to a developed and pervasive payment infrastructure. Among
China's most-used solutions is Tencent's [WeChat, an all-in-one platform
that combines social messaging, mobile payments, and in-app programs
that are portals for shopping and gaming]{.underline}.

Internet data in China, meanwhile, is provided by the big three
state-owned telecom companies, so the government retains ultimate
control over data pricing. Last year, the Chinese government ordered the
companies to slash the cost of mobile data by 30% as part of a push to
evolve the digital economy, which the government sees as one of the
major drivers of growth. China\'s traditional heavy industries are in
decline, and the government wants to stimulate domestic consumption of
high-tech services rather than rely on exports, shipping, and
manufacturing.

A prime example of this growth was an [uptick in Chinese technology,
media, and telecommunications companies launching IPOs in 2018: More
than 50 went public with a combined market capitalization of over \$200
billion]{.underline}.¹ They included Xiaomi, a smartphone software
producer, and China Tower Company, which focuses on telecommunications
towers.

A Race for 5G Dominance

[Countries that adopt 5G first will likely experience disproportionate
advantages in the digital world, including increased economic activity
and job growth.]{.underline} Markets like China enjoy cooperation at the
local level, which is an advantage when rolling out infrastructure. In
2018, [China started 5G trials in more than a dozen cities]{.underline},
and this year the [government issued the go-ahead]{.underline} for major
state-owned mobile carriers [to start rolling out 5G]{.underline},
including commercial applications. According to the Global Financial
Markets Association, [China will account for the **largest number of 5G
connections** in 2025, with 416 million---greater than North America and
Europe combined.]{.underline}

China Aims for World Leadership in AI

AI has seen breakthroughs in recent years thanks to advances in
processing power and big data collection, among other areas. Many
governments are investing significantly in AI, viewing it as a driver of
economic growth and competitive advantage globally.

[In 2017, China\'s state council published a plan aiming to become the
world leader in AI by 2030.]{.underline} [China\'s investment in AI
already accounted for more than half of the world\'s total investments
in 2018. China's]{.underline} triumvirate of [tech giants,]{.underline}
known as BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent), [is investing heavily in AI,
including in areas **previously dominated by U.S.**
companies.]{.underline}

A recent Deloitte survey of 1,900 executives at companies that are early
adopters of AI found that [China places the most emphasis on the
strategic importance of AI compared with other countries. Forty-six
percent of Chinese companies report having created a comprehensive,
detailed, companywide strategy on AI implementation]{.underline}. In
addition, 55% percent say they have achieved strong competitive
advantage and additional commercial value with AI. Finally, per the
survey report, China reportedly has the world\'s second-highest number
of AI companies, following the United States.

China Invests Heavily in Semiconductors

Semiconductor chips are the brains that animate devices ranging from
hyperscale servers to smartphones to sensors at the edge of the network;
they represent a global market of more than \$400 billion. Companies are
racing to bring new kinds of chips to market, including those that power
AI and connect 5G smartphones.

[China is investing heavily in semiconductor production. The country
knows its future competitiveness depends on whether it can lead new
growth in areas like AI and 5G]{.underline}, which in turn depends on
its ability to produce the chips that bring these technologies to life.
With the threat of continued supply disruptions arising from trade
tensions, it\'s little wonder that China plans to make semiconductor
production an important goal going forward.

Yet, while China is now the largest consumer of semiconductors in the
world, it manufactures only about 30% of the chips it needs. In 2018,
China\'s semiconductor consumption accounted for about 41% of the global
total, which is predicted to rise to 57% by 2024. China spends more to
import semiconductors that analyze data than to import oil, according to
a Deloitte analysis. Multinational corporations trying to assess and
potentially enter the China semiconductor market can consider whether
joint ventures, for example, may be a possible avenue in light of
China's efforts to seek technology independence and establish in-country
production facilities.

\*\*\*\*\*

For China, technological independence is really about
self-determination. I[n just the past several decades, it has steadily
moved up the value chain in manufacturing and in technology, producing
some of the **world\'s largest, most advanced, and most imitated**
companies and products.]{.underline}

History For?\"; Atlantic;

To paraphrase one of Barack Obama's favorite phrases, the arc of history
is long, but it bends toward justice. Were Vladimir Putin to offer his
own rendition of these words, it would probably go something along the
lines of: The arc of history is long, but it bends backwards.

This, at least, appeared to be the thrust of the [[Russian
president]{.mark}'s message this week]{.underline} when he [offered a
rambling and ahistorical speech [dismissing Ukraine's right to exist
and]{.mark} then days later [announced Moscow's intent to]{.mark} invade
the country in order to "[demilitarize and denazify]{.mark}
Ukraine."]{.underline} In his telling, [if Ukraine had once been part of
the Soviet sphere, it should be part of Russia.]{.underline} And just as
Russia defeated the Nazi regime in Germany, it would do so again---this
time in Kyiv.

[[Putin]{.mark} is not the only world leader who has harkened back to an
ahistorical past to justify his decisions in the present.]{.underline}
[Right-wing nationalists around the world have sought to [portray
themselves as the]{.mark} primary [defenders of a glorious past]{.mark}
that their enemies would seek to deny or forget.]{.underline} [[By
**whitewashing uncomfortable legacies** and]{.mark} seeking to
[cultivate]{.mark} a politics of [historic grievance]{.mark}, Putin has
attempted the same]{.underline}. But in his justification for the
invasion of Ukraine, Putin's ahistoricism has bordered on delusion.
Whether the Russian people or the rest of the world share in it, for
now, appears to be immaterial: If there's one audience this revisionist
history is designed for, it's Putin himself.

The [evolution of [Putin's]{.mark} historical [revisionism can be
seen]{.mark} throughout his public statements [over the
years]{.mark}]{.underline}. In [[2005]{.mark}, he]{.underline} famously
[described the collapse of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical
catastrophe of the 20th century]{.underline}. Two years later[, Putin
[bemoaned]{.mark}]{.underline} the aftermath of the Soviet era and
[the]{.underline} pernicious, [[unipolar
world]{.underline}]{.mark}---[one [led]{.mark} not by Moscow, [but by
Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}---that it had created. [[Last
year]{.underline}]{.mark}, in perhaps the clearest articulation of his
worldview, [[Putin said]{.mark} that [Ukrainians and Russians are "one
people]{.mark}---a single whole."]{.underline} On Monday, he took that
sentiment even further, [declaring Ukraine to be "an inalienable part of
our own history, culture, and spiritual space" whose independence
was]{.underline} [a product]{.underline} not [of]{.underline}
self-determination (Ukrainians resoundingly voted in favor of
independence from the Soviet Union in a 1991 referendum), but rather ["a
mistake."]{.underline}

Unlike his 2014 address announcing Moscow's annexation of Crimea, which
was largely framed as a moment of celebration, this was an angry
speech---one ostensibly designed to make Russia's people angry too, and
to justify what was to come[. "In territories adjacent to Russia, which
I have to note is our historical land, a [**hostile 'anti-Russia' is
taking shape,"** Putin said]{.mark} in another address]{.underline}
ahead of the invasion. ["For our country, **[it is a matter of life and
death,]{.mark}** a matter of our historical future as a
nation."]{.underline}

It's hard to know what Putin means by historical future (which is, on
its face, an oxymoron), though we can take an educated guess. When Putin
speaks of Russia today, he speaks of a country whose greatness is
defined by its past---namely, its imperial history and its victory
during World War II---which he believes must guide its present. "Putin
weaponized history by giving it a function," Orysia Lutsevych, the head
of the Ukraine Forum at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told
me. As far as the Russian president is concerned, "history is the
fortune teller of the future."

Such historical narratives can be compelling, especially when they
elicit the kind of nostalgic nationalism that has proved potent
elsewhere, including in the United States (where Donald Trump's
Republican Party has dubbed itself the defender of "patriotic
education"), India (where Hindu nationalists have appealed to pride in
India's past to undermine its secular present), and Hungary (where Prime
Minister Viktor Orbán often invokes the territories the country lost
after the First World War). "[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} is not the
only person who is old enough to have [[felt]{.mark} that sense of deep,
personalized [humiliation]{.mark} and shame that came [with]{.mark} the
[loss of power]{.mark} of the Soviet Union]{.underline} at the end of
the Cold War," Keir Giles, the author of ​​Moscow Rules: What Drives
Russia to Confront the West, told me. "[[Anything that reasserts Russia
as]{.mark} that **[great power]{.mark} [with]{.mark} a greater status**
than others and the **[right to a global]{.mark} presence** and global
[influence]{.mark} in others' affairs [will be **popular** in]{.mark}
those sectors of the [Russia]{.mark}n population]{.underline}."

Still, it's difficult to gauge just how big that sector is or how
pervasive the narrative has been among those who don't share Putin's
semi-mythological view of history. A [recent CNN poll, published the day
before the start of Moscow's military invasion of Ukraine, found that
though roughly [half of Russians support using military force to prevent
Ukraine from joining NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, only 36 percent support
doing so as a means of forcing a reunification of the two countries. The
lack of support for the latter was most clearly evidenced by anti-war
protests that have broken out across Russian cities.

When I spoke with [Denis Volkov, the director of]{.underline} the
Moscow-based Levada Center, [Russia's last independent
pollster]{.underline}, in early February, he [told me that though the
majority of Russians fear war, few would feel comfortable voicing
opposition to it if it came due to fear of reprisals]{.underline}.
Indeed, more than 1,700 arrests have already been made. Besides, Volkov
said, "[public opinion will be no limit to the Russian
government]{.underline}."

Though Putin may feel obliged to justify his war of choice to the
Russian people, who with Ukrainians will share the costs of a bloody and
drawn-out conflict[, his revisionist history is designed to appeal
to]{.underline} no one more so than [himself.]{.underline} [[By
**restoring Russia's control over**]{.mark} **its [former
territories]{.mark}**[, Putin]{.mark} not only corrects what he sees as
a historic wrong but also **[cements his place]{.mark}** in Russian
history [as the leader who restored the country]{.mark} to its rightful
status.]{.underline}
