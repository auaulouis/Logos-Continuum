Offensive Cyber Operations in NATO Strategy Above and Below the Level of
Warfare

Historically, [[NATO's cyber posture]{.mark} has largely **[focused on
defense]{.mark} and resilience**]{.underline}---and [this continues to
form the bulk of NATO's approach.]{.underline} The alliance maintains
that [[its "main focus in cyber defence is to protect its own
networks]{.mark} (including operations and missions) and enhance
resilience]{.underline}." At the 2014 Wales summit, NATO endorsed the
Enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, which affirmed that cyber defense is part
of collective defense and that the alliance would incorporate cyber
defense into its planning and operations. In 2016, NATO members pledged
to improve their cyber defenses through training, education, exercises,
and information sharing.

But the [[seeds]{.mark} were]{.underline} also [[planted in 2016
for]{.mark} NATO to consider a potential role for [o]{.mark}ffensive
[c]{.mark}yber [o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. That year,
[the alliance recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations,
comparable to land, sea, and air. [At]{.mark} the
[2018]{.mark}]{.underline} Brussels [summit, NATO began to more
seriously consider offensive cyber operations]{.underline}.
Specifically, [[NATO created the Cyberspace Operations Centre to
**coordinate requests** for member states to **provide**
]{.mark}**offensive cyber [effects]{.mark}**]{.underline} through the
Sovereign Cyber Effects [Provided Voluntarily by Allies]{.underline}
process. Following the 2018 summit, then-Secretary of Defense James
Mattis stated in a press conference that five states---the United
States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Estonia---were
contributing cyber forces to "help NATO fight in this important domain."
More recently, [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} June [[2021,
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} convened in Brussels and [[committed to
a]{.underline}]{.mark} [Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy]{.underline}.
A key feature of the new policy is the [[prominent role of
o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber
[o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Brussels, member states
committed to "employ the full range of capabilities at all times to
actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber
threats."

[[NATO's]{.mark} shift to incorporating offensive cyber operations into
existing strategy and policy has focused on integrating offensive
effects]{.underline} into conventional military plans and operations in
the context of a conflict. While NATO's updated strategy is a positive
development,---particularly the mismatch between the alliance's clear
distinction between wartime [its [limited focus on conflict
scenarios]{.mark} for employing cyber power **fails [to accurately
account]{.mark}** [for the]{.mark} cyber [threat environment NATO
faces]{.mark}]{.underline} and peacetime **[[and]{.mark} the approach of
[adversaries like Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**, who adopt a
competition-conflict continuum. Additionally, the [focus on employing
offensive cyber during a high-end conventional fight is also **not
consistent** with how several NATO members are already engaged in gray
zone offensive cyber operations.]{.underline}

The primary threat to NATO allies in the cyber domain is not from
high-end, decisive cyberattacks. Instead, cyber threats more frequently
and effectively manifest as gray zone tactics designed to have a
corrosive effect without rising to the level of warfare. There are
numerous examples of this type of threat. For instance, in July 2021,
NATO publicly condemned a range of malicious cyber behavior, including
the Microsoft Exchange hack (which NATO attributed to China) and
ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure. Russia has
leveraged cyber and disinformation operations to interfere in democratic
elections in the United States in 2016, 2018, and 2020; France in 2017;
and Germany in 2017 and 2021---to name just a few examples. Russia also
conducted distributed denial-of-service cyberattacks against government
websites in Montenegro during the lead-up to, and following,
Montenegro's ascension to NATO in 2017. And when NATO forces were
positioned in the Baltics beginning in 2017 as part of NATO's enhanced
forward presence, two threat actors, GhostWriter and Secondary
Infektion, conducted a range of disinformation campaigns.

Additionally, the reality is [that several [NATO members are already
speaking publicly about o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber
[o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark} below the level of warfare and their
statements and actions have an effect on the entire
alliance]{.underline}. In particular, [[NATO member]{.mark}
nation[s]{.mark} [have **not reached a political consensus** about the
role of o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber
[o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2018, the US Department of
Defense and US Cyber Command issued new strategy and policy documents
that articulated a role for the military in conducting offensive cyber
operations below the level of armed conflict outside of US-controlled
cyberspace (part of the "defend forward" strategy), and there has been
some reporting about US offensive cyber operations. For instance, in
2018 the United States disrupted the Russian-linked Internet Research
Agency from interfering in the midterm elections. And, more recently,
[in December 2021]{.underline} General Paul Nakasone, [commander of [US
Cyber Comm]{.mark}and, [publicly acknowledged]{.mark} that [the
military]{.mark} played a role in [disrupting ransomware groups]{.mark}
targeting critical infrastructure]{.underline}. The United States has
also worked with other NATO allies, such as Estonia and Montenegro, to
conduct "hunt forward" cyber operations on allied and partner networks
to uncover and disrupt malicious cyber activity.

Other [NATO [allies have]{.mark} also [been more transparent about
o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber
[o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In 2020, the United
Kingdom announced a significant investment in its National Cyber Force,
its organizational arm for offensive cyber operations, and its 2022
National Cyber Strategy emphasized the role of offensive cyber
operations. In November 2021, General Nakasone and the director of
Government Communications Headquarters---the UK government's principal
signals intelligence agency---stated jointly that the two governments
were collaborating to "impose consequences" in cyberspace to disrupt
adversary operations. The Netherlands has also publicly alluded to
conducting offensive cyber operations.

Next Steps: Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks

Given the threat environment facing NATO, as well as the activities of
several NATO members[, [the alliance should]{.mark}
deliberately]{.underline}---but purposefully---[consider
**[incorporat]{.mark}ing [o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber
[o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} below the level of armed
conflict [[into its deterrence strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Any effort
to explore a role for offensive cyber operations should also consider
the challenges and risks that may come with doing so. A central
challenge is that, at the political level, NATO allies lack consensus on
the appropriate application of offensive cyber power---especially below
the level of armed conflict. [[Addressing]{.underline}]{.mark} these
[[disagreements]{.mark} among member states is [essential
because]{.mark} conducting [o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber
[o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark} often [require]{.mark}s maneuvering through
or [operating on networks]{.mark} controlled [by]{.mark} an ally or
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Right now, [[NATO]{.mark} members [do
not]{.mark} collectively [agree on the protocols]{.mark} and processes
[for partner actions]{.mark} in allied networks]{.underline}---and
[[they]{.mark} also [disagree on how to define sovereignty]{.mark} in
cyberspace, or when an offensive cyber operation would rise to the level
of an armed attack.]{.underline}

[Offensive cyber operations for NATO also present real interoperability
challenges]{.underline}. The [role of intelligence in cyber operations
is likely to complicate NATO planning processes]{.underline}. Even close
allies are likely to be wary about sharing sensitive intelligence for a
number of reasons. For instance, they may be averse to sharing
information gleaned from signals intelligence collection or because a
member state may be using the same exploits for both offensive action
and their own espionage---including intelligence collection against
allies. Or, allies may simply be worried that sensitive information may
become exposed. On top of this, [[it's challenging to]{.mark} adjudicate
intelligence requirements among allies and to [deconflict
intel]{.mark}ligence and military priorities]{.underline}. It is [also
not clear whether the alliance has **established consensus thresholds**
that specify the conditions and timeline under which a state would have
to notify others of its activities on their networks]{.underline}---if
at all.

[The [alliance should]{.mark}]{.underline} account for, and [address,
these issues as NATO explores]{.underline} the prospect of
**[[incorporat]{.mark}ing [o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber
[o]{.mark}peration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** below the level of armed
conflict [[into existing NATO]{.mark} simulations and [exercises]{.mark}
that span the **strategic, operational, and tactical
levels**.]{.underline} A number of important questions about how to
coordinate offensive cyber operations and define roles and
responsibilities remain unanswered. For instance, how could allies
improve intelligence sharing to conduct more rapid attribution, enabling
one state or the alliance to respond to adversary cyber activity? What
are the conditions under which allies should consider dividing
responsibilities for cyber campaign planning and developing accesses and
capabilities against strategic targets in, for example, Russia? If some
allies are responsible for offensive cyber operations against certain
targets, what are the information-sharing and notification requirements?

**[The analysis]{.underline}** of five national case studies **[has
resulted in]{.underline}** the identification of different approaches
towards cyber defence, as **[proof of how much has yet to be
accomplished in defining shared doctrines and procedures.]{.underline}**
Among the countries taken into consideration, **[a substantial divide
can be traced between states]{.underline}** that envisage the
possibility of carrying out exclusively defensive actions, and those
that count on the ability to perform offensive operations also in the
absence of a cyber-attack.

Among the first group are Germany and Spain, which envision cyber
deterrence as the country's ability to promptly and adequately respond
to a cyber-attack, enacting what is defined as hack-back. Additional
differences between Berlin and Madrid concern the possibility of
deploying the armed forces on national territory in the event of an
attack, which would need prior authorisation by Parliament in Germany.
It is important to note, however, that **[this procedure poorly matches
the speed of reaction necessary to limit or avoid the damage of a
cyber-attack]{.underline}**: parliamentary timeframes, in cases that
require rapid and tailored actions, could mean the state's inability to
protect its primary interests and thus hinder national defence.

London, Paris and Washington, by contrast, have a different
understanding of the possibilities deriving from an active use of cyber
defence. For the three capitals, cyber defence and deterrence are about
ensuring not only reaction capabilities in the event of a cyber-attack,
but also the possibility of a preventive action against potential
adversaries, be they state or non-state actors. Following this logic,
for instance, the UK carried out a cyber-attack to the detriment of ISIS
in 2016.

Despite these differences, it is possible to outline shared
**[necessities]{.underline}** among the five countries **[take into
consideration]{.underline}**, which can be summed up as follows: •
**[Necessity to have a shared regulatory and doctrinal framework at the
NATO,]{.underline}** EU and international level; • **[Better
integration]{.underline}** of the cyber element in national
**[and]{.underline}** allied command structures; • **[More structured
and strategic collaboration]{.underline}** with enterprises and research
entities; • Specialised training of military personnel devoted to
protection from the cyber threat; and • Increased awareness about the
use of cyberspace among state officials, critical infrastructure
managers and the population in general.

IN NATO'S DETERRENCE POSTURE \"; Modern War Institute;

In this context, classical deterrence theory in regards of utilizing
offensive cyber capabilities as a deterrent, should be improved by
considering the secretive nature of offensive cyber capabilities and not
requiring their exposure the same way as it is expected from using
conventional means as deterrent. In this context, [it should be more
emphasized that the capability and willingness of relaying different
types of cyber effects is there]{.underline}. [This can be done through
exercises but also through previously conducted offensive cyber
operations in other domains.]{.underline}

[Another feature that the classical deterrence theories do not address -
but need to in order to explain how the offensive cyber
capabilities]{.underline} [can be used as means of deterrence -
is]{.underline} taking into account the [time constraint]{.underline}.
The latter in the sense that [deploying those cyber weapons]{.underline}
which [have the potential to generate **greater strategic effects** by
targeting the functionality of critical infrastructure]{.underline} for
instance, tends to be a long-term process[. In order to instantly
retaliate the enemy with this kind of operation, the deterrer needs to
be in the adversary's systems beforehand]{.underline}. Notably, as it
was described in the theoretical section above, developing a
sophisticated cyber weapon that could inflict damage on the industrial
control system for instance, involves numerous time-consuming steps. The
question that needs to be considered in this regard is how to hold the
enemy at risk by threatening to harm the critical infrastructure through
offensive cyber means in case it should decide to attack. Subsequently,
if it requires the presence-based approach, then how to communicate that
to the adversary to ensure the credibility of the threat, but without
increasing instability between the actors?

However, in general, the mainstream deterrence theories seem to remain
applicable to utilizing offensive cyber capabilities as means of
deterrence. Because despite the different means to be used, it is still
necessary to reflect to the potential enemy which kind of retaliatory
capabilities one has and thereby which costs the enemy can expect in
case it decides to attack. Therefore, the following recommendations can
be given to NATO on how it could bolster its deterrence posture through
the utilization of offensive cyber capabilities as means of deterrence.

First, NATO should take a step further and not limit itself considering
the offensive cyber capabilities only as measures to deter the enemy
from carrying out malicious activity in cyberspace. The strategic value
of offensive cyber capabilities has been presented in this paper and
thereby [NATO should seek for options to include offensive cyber
capabilities as means of **cross-domain deterrence**.]{.underline} This
should accordingly be reflected in its strategy documents. However, for
effective deterrence the identified credibility issues need to be
mitigated.

[NATO and its member states]{.underline} -- particularly those that have
offered their capabilities for the NATO's use -- [need to achieve a
**common terminology and understanding of the offensive cyber
capabilities** and offensive cyber operations.]{.underline} Analysing
the public documents from this angle, it was identified that the degree
of effects Allies considered to be generated through the offensive cyber
operations did differ. These different perceptions need to be aligned to
make sure the enemy perceives that the Alliance has unified position on
how the offensive cyber capabilities could be deployed and what kind of
cyber effect it is willing to relay.

[Third recommendation would be]{.underline} to have [a clearer message
on which kind of costs the enemy could expect from the deterrer's
offensive cyber capabilities.]{.underline} The actions alone are not
enough. [Words complement the actions and enable to prevent
misperceptions and thereby mitigate the potential security dilemma that
may occur]{.underline}. As noted in the theoretical part, [relaying
kinetic effects has greater strategic value, especially by targeting the
critical infrastructure that the military also relies on]{.underline}.
In this case -- as it was also illuminated on the existing deterrence
theory -- it could be necessary to have access in the enemy's systems
before the crisis should erupt. Because NATO has emphasized its
defensive posture also while talking about the offensive cyber
capabilities, then it is particularly important to create the right
narrative to avoid increasing the instability, contributing to security
dilemma, and enabling the enemy to have a misperception on this. Finding
the right balance here is probably the most difficult task. Thus, having
an improved version of deterrence theory that can explain and guide how
to make the cyber threat credible without increasing the instability,
would be extremely valuable.

However, logic effects should not be left aside. Depending on the
target, this could be the way to go as well. [**Concerning Russia** --
the subject of NATO's deterrence -- should be vulnerable to logic
effects that intend to affect the stability of internal
politics.]{.underline} This is presumed based on Rivera's work on to
which kind of cyberattacks countries are vulnerable to based on their
power position and social cohesion (Rivera 2015:9-11). However, this
should be further examined in the future on what would be strategically
the most valuable targets to hold at risk as part of the deterrent
threat related to Russia.

To sum up, [NATO has the potential to bolster its deterrence by
considering the offensive cyber capabilities as means of
deterrence]{.underline}. [It can be]{.underline} partly [achieved
by]{.underline} starting with meeting the conditions classical
deterrence theories have set, like [having a **clear and unified message
about the cyber capabilities** as retaliatory measures]{.underline}.
Yet, to ensure the total effectiveness, the classical deterrence theory
[needs to be improved by **acknowledging the secretive nature** of
offensive cyber capabilities and answering questions on **how to hold
the enemy at risk** by threatening to harm its critical infrastructure
through offensive cyber means and if presence-based approach is
required, how to communicate that to the adversary without increasing
instability between the actors.]{.underline}

I think it has really shown [in an information-driven world
[if]{.mark}]{.underline} [[we can **share intelligence**]{.mark} with
the public and [with our allies in a]{.mark} more [real-time]{.mark}
basis, it [puts us back in the game in terms of information
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}. I think [over the last number of
years]{.underline}, frankly, [[Russia has been]{.mark} a **[much
better]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- has been much better [[at using
information warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} or, particularly,
disinformation. We all saw the Russian involvement in 2016 in our
elections. [[We've continued to see Russia]{.mark} use social media in a
much, [much more aggressive]{.mark} way]{.underline}. The fact that we
were able to get this information out into the bloodstream, you know
demonstrating and taking away any ability for Putin to claim that there
was any Ukrainian provocation that started this war, it really has left
Putin exposed as being the absolute culprit in starting this war.
There's no credible claim otherwise. So that, I think, is important.

And also, [the **willingness to share** with our allies.]{.underline}
Obviously, we share a lot of times with our Five Eye allies. But this
one, the [i[nfo]{.underline}]{.mark}[rmation [sharing with]{.mark} the
balance of [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and in some cases even beyond
NATO, [it's not by chance that we ended up, I believe, with 142 votes in
the U.N. General Assembly]{.underline} a week ago. A lot of [that was
because the American intelligence we were sharing]{.underline} with a
lot of folks. I [hope this [will be a precursor to a much more
**ongoing**]{.mark}**, active [intelligence
network]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And, candidly, again, [the power of
information sharing ought to be a **stronger part** of our]{.underline},
you know[, military, diplomatic, and overall statecraft.]{.underline}

Dr. Lewis: Thank you. I think that's really a neat point [that [intel
sharing]{.mark} is something that [lets us get an
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline} in the intel -- [[in the information
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. So useful. I'm going to ask for a crystal
ball moment. I almost saved this for last. You can dodge it if you want.
But some of us have been following the CHIPS Act for however long it's
been in play -- is it a decade now? I don't know. But -- (laughs) --
that's not fair. But has this changed the dynamics on the Hill vis-à-vis
the sense that we are now in a much more immediate conflict with Russia,
and I would say with China? How has it changed the dynamic?

The [US has been widely acknowledged as the global cyber power which is

Therefore, the [US is **extremely important asset for NATO** to have
credibility and capability imposing retaliatory threat in
cyberspace]{.underline}. [The US has not been clear]{.underline} in
words either [which capabilities exactly it possesses]{.underline}, but
the actions give a taste of it. The SCADA-attack against the Iranian
nuclear facility in Natanz that caused kinetic effects is a significant
reflection of it (Zetter 2014). What can be noted here is that the
offensive cyber capabilities have been presented through their
deployment.

If we also take a look at what Stoltenberg said in regards of the
sovereign cyber capabilities certain Allies have given for the use of
NATO, he does not give a clear answer to how the capabilities will be
used as part of NATO's missions and operations. However, he does refer
to the capability and will to use it in regards of disrupting networks,
in other words attacking the availability of data.

"[We have been able to disrupt the cyber networks of Daesh to reduce
their ability to recruit, to fund, to communicate.]{.underline} And
[these capabilities have been used by NATO Allies against Daesh and
these are the same kind of capabilities we now are **creating the
framework to integrate** into NATO missions and operations]{.underline}"

#### US leadership key to norm-building in cybersecurity---otherwise risk of pushback dooms cyber norms

The [last set of norms]{.underline} came in 2015 during a previous GGE.
It set out that nations should not carry out cyber acts that seek to
intentionally damage other nations' critical infrastructure, such as
power grids, water supplies, and financial services. The GGE [process
came to an abrupt end]{.underline} in 2017 [owing to considerable push
back from China, Russia, and Cuba]{.underline}. They opposed majority
positions on the right to self-defense and the application of
international humanitarian law, which regulates the humanitarian aspects
of armed conflict. Conflicting interests on rules on, or related to,
"free internet" and "cyber sovereignty" will continue to play out in
both GGE and OEWG talks. [Future push-back will only continue to stifle
progress on norm-building]{.underline}. So [what does this mean for the
United States]{.underline}?

[The United States needs to engage **like-minded
partners**]{.underline}. They not only share like interests but play a
vital role in projecting American interest abroad. [Take for example how
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (**NATO**) broadened its
collective defense commitment to include provisions for "cyber
attacks]{.underline}" in 2014, or how the United States and Japan
similarly broadened their mutual defense commitment in 2019[. Here's
what the United States and like-minded partners should do
next:]{.underline}

[**Reinforce existing norms**: Like-minded partners should introduce
enforcement procedures for nations that don't abide by existing
norms.]{.underline} They should [affirm that there are consequences for
bad behavior in cyberspace]{.underline}. Some [possible examples of
enforcement include **facilitating robust information-sharing** to
thwart other nations' wrongful cyber acts and **developing defensive and
offensive joint cyber operations**.]{.underline} Nations that don't
follow the rules must know that they will be held accountable.

[**Develop new norms**: Like-minded partners should also develop new
norms]{.underline}, especially where OEWG or GGE consensus is unlikely.
[Some possible examples of norm-building include the right to respond to
wrongful cyber acts in self-defense and the application of
**international humanitarian law** in armed conflicts involving
**cyberspace**.]{.underline} The progress on norms must be wrapped into
both OEWG and GGE talks to push consensus in the right direction.

Norm-building on cyberspace remains controversial. Some will say that
working with like-minded partners undermines United Nations processes[.
Yet existing norms are a clear indication that these processes protect
the United States' interests and make cyberspace safer for all
nations]{.underline}. The OEWG or GGE talks will not reach consensus
anytime soon, therefore [the United States should press ahead with
like-minded partners all the sooner]{.underline}.

[**The United States needs to step up and lead**. It needs to engage
like-minded partners.]{.underline} It needs to reinforce existing norms
and develop new ones to affirm that there are consequences for bad
behavior in cyberspace. [The United States **can't risk the possibility
of adversaries** at the forefront of norm-building. This is an
opportunity for **American leadership to make cyberspace safer** for all
nations]{.underline}.

### I/L -- Intel Sharing Key

#### NATO intelligence sharing key to allied response

**Maigre 22** (Merle Maigre is a Non-resident Senior Fellow with CEPA\'s
Transatlantic Leadership Program and CEPA\'s Digital Innovation
Initiative, 4/6/22, accessed 6/24/22, "NATO's Role In Global
CyberSecurity",

[[https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security)
(JB)

Four sets of actions for NATO are proposed. First, denying covertness by
attribution: [NATO should persuade opponents that they cannot be
clandestine in their cyber actions.]{.underline} NATO and its members
need to demonstrate that it is difficult or impossible to act covertly
and be clear about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks.

Until recently, governments did not publicly release details on cyber
incidents. But since 2018, public disclosures of cyberattacks by several
Western powers indicate a new multinational policy of state
transparency. The growing relevance of attribution is partially due to
states becoming better at attributing cyber operations. Greater public
knowledge of cyberattacks heightens awareness of cyber conflicts and
leads to greater public acceptance of cyber countermeasures.

[Ultimately, what matters is that **states engaging in unlawful actions
using cyber means will face consequences.** With attribution,
policymakers show that they know what is happening in these networks and
can investigate incidents.]{.underline} It also clearly spells out
unacceptable behavior and can help create state practice. [The **[best
way to implement]{.mark}**]{.underline} the international norms [[**is
by** calling out behavior and having **consequences when**
]{.mark}**these [norms are breached]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Attribution
will make clear to the malicious actor that their actions will be seen
and addressed. It is the basis, under international law, for
countermeasures and self-defense.

When should states publicly attribute cyberattacks? Effective public
attribution requires a clear understanding of the attributed cyber
operation and the cyber-threat actor, but also the broader geopolitical
environment, allied positions and activities, and the legal context. The
public attribution framework put forward by Max Smeets and Florian
Egloff in March
2021[[27]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote27_pukyrym)

distinguishes four factors that act as enablers or constraints in public
attribution. These factors are intelligence, incident severity,
geopolitical context, and post-attribution actions. The combination of
these four components enables consistent decision-making about whether
to publicly disseminate information about an adversary's actions,
privately tell the adversary, or restrict knowledge of the intrusion to
the government and potentially other partners.

Collecting and processing intelligence---information about foreign
countries and their agents---provides a technical basis for attribution.
How could allies improve intelligence sharing to conduct more rapid
attribution and enable a response to adversary cyber activity? During
the Nordic-Baltic foreign ministers meeting in Tallinn in September
2020, a 90-minute tabletop exercise was
organized[[28]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote28_cpch8u5)

to test the ministers' ability to respond to and attribute an escalating
cyberattack. They answered multiple-choice questions on communication of
and possible diplomatic countermeasures to the attack. The ministers
learned through first-hand experience that [a timely exchange of
technical intelligence can be key in attributing any
cyberattack]{.underline}. "The shared view \[of the countries
involved\]---especially when it comes to complicated issues---is
crucial," said Urmas Reinsalu, Foreign Minister of
Estonia.[[29]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote29_topliia)

Attribution is only as good as the information that allies are willing
to share. NATO's value can be in becoming the preferred platform for
sharing cyber information. General Paul Nakasone, who heads US Cyber
Command, told the House Armed Services subcommittee on intelligence that
"in 35 years" he has never seen a better sharing of accurate, timely,
and actionable intelligence than what has transpired with
Ukraine.[[30]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote30_qki9qsu)

[**[Sharing information and intelligence with allies "builds coalitions"
and can "shine a light on disinformation"
campaigns]{.underline}**,]{.mark} like the one Russia used to lay the
groundwork for their invasion of Ukraine.

As the second course of action, [[**NATO should**]{.mark} use the
current crisis to]{.underline} accelerate the progress with setting up
NATO's own cyber command and [[**sharpen allied responses** to malicious
cyber actions]{.underline}.]{.mark} Overall, **[this [would give more
credibility to its cyber defense]{.mark}]{.underline}.** In February
2019, allies endorsed a set of tools to respond to cumulative cyber
activities, but not much has happened to take it forward. It is now time
to build upon this set and develop concrete steps at the political,
military, and technical levels to model alliance behavior according to
the threat landscape. This means a sharper focus on future responses to
high- and low-end cyberattacks along with concrete deterrence actions
and tools for individual sectors and target types. [Much of this is
based on the high-end cyber capabilities of select individual
allies]{.underline} called "volunteer sovereign cyber effects," [where
cyber-capable nations deliver voluntarily offensive cyber effects on a
target designated by an operational-level commander.]{.underline} The
NATO Cyber Command would be responsible for matching military needs with
the willingness and capabilities of the nations potentially able to
deliver such
effects.[[31]{.underline}](https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security#footnote31_9likw2h)

[[**The alliance should clarify which allies are responsible for
offensive cyber operations against certain targets** and]{.mark} the
[information-sharing and notification requirements]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### **[I/L -- Defending Forward Key]{.underline}**

#### That requires defending forward

Erica D. **Lonergan 20,** Assistant Professor in the Army Cyber
Institute, PhD in Political Science from Columbia University,
"Operationalizing Defend Forward", Lawfare, 03/12/2020,
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/operationalizing-defend-forward-how-concept-works-change-adversary-behavior>,
accessed 6/24/2022.

[Defend forward is a crucial component of the Cyberspace Solarium
Commission's strategic concept of layered cyber deterrence]{.underline},
particularly in terms of defend forward's role in creating costs for
adversaries conducting malicious behavior in cyberspace. [The commission
reimagines defend forward,]{.underline} originally articulated in the
2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, as a whole-of-nation concept.
That said, here I will focus on the logic of defend forward in its
military application and detail how the concept should be
operationalized. [[Defend forward,]{.mark} as defined by the commission,
[entails]{.mark} the [proactive]{.mark} [observing, pursuing, and
countering of adversary operations and]{.mark} imposing costs in
day-to-day competition to disrupt and defeat ongoing malicious adversary
cyber campaigns, deter future campaigns, and reinforce favorable
international norms of behavior, using all the instruments of national
power.]{.underline} This piece traces the emergence of the logic of
defend forward and describes how the commission built on existing
concepts to more fully articulate defend forward's theory of victory and
how defend forward seeks to accomplish desired end states.

Defend forward, as a strategic concept, grew out of a number of related
realizations about the strategic environment in cyberspace. First,
[Defense Department entities governed under Title 10 of the U.S. Code
have to be able to more routinely operate outside of the department's
own networks]{.underline}, known as the Department of Defense
Information Network. Adversary operations span global cyberspace because
the environment is not defined by geographic boundaries or even shared
understandings about how sovereignty applies in this domain. [If the
Defense Department's ability to operate outside of its own networks was
more limited and circumscribed, as envisioned in the 2015 Department of
Defense Cyber Strategy, the department would be giving free reign to
adversary actors that traverse global networks constrained only by
capabilities.]{.underline}

Second, [**[intelligence collection in cyberspace]{.mark} against an
adversary [cannot be conducted]{.mark} solely [through static, passive
]{.mark}**[collection. Observing adversaries]{.mark} as they
maneuver---and understanding their evolving organizations, capabilities,
techniques and personas---[requires the **U.S., or its allies**]{.mark}
**and partners,** [to gain access to networks]{.mark} and systems where
adversaries operate]{.underline}. The challenge is that this
infrastructure is owned by some entity, whether by the U.S. government,
private companies or individuals, allied and partner governments, or the
adversary. In other words, unlike in other domains, there are no "high
seas" or "international waters" in cyberspace. It is important to
acknowledge this reality and be transparent about its implications for
how the U.S. can and should operate to achieve defensive strategic
objectives consistent with international law.

Third, [to rapidly generate effects in cyberspace at the desired time,
forces and capabilities have to routinely operate where the adversary
is]{.underline}. In cyberspace, a decision-maker cannot simply call for
fires and reliably anticipate that the desired effect will be delivered
against the intended target at the right time. [**[Cyber
operations]{.mark} and campaigns [demand]{.mark} operational
[preparation of the environment; prior intel]{.mark}ligence [collection
and operations to identify vulnerabilities]{.mark} and** exploits; the
development or procurement of tools to deliver the intended effects; and
the ability to hold targets at risk over time]{.underline} to deliver
the appropriate effect on a decision-maker's request. Relatedly,
capabilities are dynamic---today's tools may be irrelevant
tomorrow---and opportunities are fleeting---today's access may be gone
by tomorrow. Therefore, maintaining cyber capabilities and forces in
reserve cedes the initiative to adversaries.

The above understanding coalesced into a new Defense Department strategy
anchored in the defend forward concept. Its operationalization, as
demonstrated by U.S. efforts to counter Russian interference in the 2018
U.S. midterm elections, was enhanced by further changes to policymaking
processes, the delegation of authorities and law. But the Cyberspace
Solarium Commission recognized that further work remained to be done to
parse the strategic logic of defend forward, identify its desired end
states, and trace the causal processes that link its implementation with
those objectives.

The commission addresses a central question posed by defend forward: How
can the U.S. positively change adversary behavior in cyberspace short of
war to produce a more favorable status quo in the short to medium term,
while cultivating stability in the international system over the long
term?

This question implies a number of desired end states. The first is to
change the status quo for activities below the level of war, in which
adversaries operate in and through cyberspace to contest U.S. interests
on a routine basis. Specifically, **[[defend forward]{.mark} seeks to
[reduce the magnitude and effects of malicious adversary
behavior]{.mark}, recognizing it is impossible to stop or prevent all
unwanted activities.]{.underline}** The second is to maintain the status
quo regarding managing within- and cross-domain escalation dynamics.
[The U.S. should be able to preserve deterrence of cyberattacks of
significant consequence, while being able to employ cyber capabilities
below the level of armed attack without triggering significant adversary
retaliation or escalation.]{.underline} Third, over the long term,
[defend forward aims to contribute to the establishment and enforcement
of favorable international norms of behavior.]{.underline} Norms do
exist in cyberspace, but not all are consistent with U.S. interests and
values.

### I/L -- Deterrence 

#### That unlocks a [joint]{.underline} offensive cyber capability that deters [conflict]{.underline} and [increases]{.underline} operational strength\-\--it facilitates [knowledge transfer]{.underline}, improves [attack coordination]{.underline}, and streamlines [decision-making]{.underline}.

**University of Exeter** **20**. "Should NATO Adopt a Joint Offensive
Cyber Capability?" September 2020.
<https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/strategyandsecurityinstitute/pdfs/mstrat/James_Prideaux.pdf>.
//AN

With this established, it is possible to set out this chapter's main
argument: that [a **joint offensive cyber capability** would enhance the
Alliance's **cyber-deterrent posture**]{.underline}. There are **[three
reasons]{.underline}** for this. [It would]{.underline}: [improve
intra-alliance **knowledge transfer** of cyber-intelligence]{.underline}
gathering and cyber-sabotage techniques; [help **coordinate attacks and
mitigate fratricide**]{.underline}; [accelerate
decision-making]{.underline} [and **streamline response** scenario
planning]{.underline}.

**[First]{.underline}**, NATO's cyber-deterrence would be more credible
because [a **joint cyber capability** would facilitate **knowledge
transfer** between member states]{.underline}. [For **deterrence** to be
**successful**]{.underline}, [NATO has to convince aggressors that it
can retaliate against the right aggressor in a manner that imposes
**unacceptable costs**]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, state and
non-state [actors]{.underline}, like the Fancy Bear cyber-espionage
group likely [associated with]{.underline} the [Russian]{.underline}
security [services]{.underline}, [know that the **disaggregation** of
member states' cyber assets makes this harder to achieve]{.underline}.89
The primary reason for this separation of effort is that intelligence on
adversaries' cyber vulnerabilities is closely guarded by national
intelligence agencies.90 This intelligence is absolutely critical for
effective cyber attac[ks]{.underline}, since it is necessary to
understand the targeted systems in great detail.91 [The **CyOC** will
not go **far enough** in fostering intelligence sharing]{.underline},
even though it aims to 'integrate cyber capabilities into NATO planning
and operations'.92 It is certainly a step forward, but of those states
that have offered their cyber effects to NATO, France and [**America**
have]{.underline} clearly [stated they will retain **full control** of
their operations]{.underline} and capabilities.93 [This **lack** of
joint operational authority poses a]{.underline} significant
**[challenge]{.underline}**, as it appears the centre will serve to
coordinate rather than oversee operations.94 [It]{.underline} will prove
very hard to achieve even this when [members' capabilities **vary
greatly** in their maturity and development]{.underline}. Whereas
Germany is said to have thousands of 'information and cyber officers',
other European states have hardly any.95 Overall, [NATO in its current
state is **not optimised** for deterrence-by-punishment and the CyOC
will do little to improve this]{.underline}.

[Instead]{.underline}, [pooling members' cyber-intelligence and
cyber-sabotage expertise would encourage **intra-alliance** knowledge
transfer]{.underline}. Knowledge transfer in organisations is the
process through which one unit, like a department or division, is
affected by the experience of another.96 Empirical evidence suggests
that [**interconnected** organisations]{.underline} like franchises and
chains [hold **comparative** advantages over their **autonomous**
counterparts]{.underline}, due to the ability to transfer knowledge
between their constituent elements.97

[This would apply to **NATO**]{.underline} in two ways.
[First]{.underline}, organisational [**integration** of
cyber-intelligence]{.underline} would facilitate knowledge transfer, as
demonstrated by the preparations behind Stuxnet.98 To design such a
complex computer worm, the US National Security Agency (NSA)
collaborated with Israel's counterpart, Unit 8200, largely because it
had deep intelligence about operations at Iran's Natanz facility.99 This
was vital for the attack's success, because the individual control
systems they targeted had unique configurations, making them harder to
penetrate.100

[Second]{.underline}, [**merging** cyber-sabotage
capabilities]{.underline} would similarly aid knowledge transfer. There
are two types of knowledge required for cyber-sabotage operations. One
type is explicit and can be transferred in a systematic manner, such as
knowledge of how a SCADA system works or how to write code in a certain
programming language.101 The other, more significant type is tacit
knowledge, which is difficult to transfer to another person by
verbalising or writing it down.102 This could include a hacker's
accumulated experience or knowledge of a cyber command's implicit
operational processes.103 Tacit knowledge can be shared, but this is
done by performance and learning by example.104 A joint offensive cyber
capability would provide an excellent opportunity for this to happen.105
[Both forms of knowledge transfer would be]{.underline} especially
[useful for '**upskilling'**]{.underline} those [NATO members that
**lack** the advanced technical **expertise** in America]{.underline},
Britain, France and Germany. In practice, [this would make acquiring
cyberattack tools and training personnel **easier and
cheaper**]{.underline}.106 The importance of training technical
personnel should not be underestimated, because all members are short of
them but most lack the resources to attract them.107 Pooling
capabilities is one way of alleviating this pressure. In turn, the
cumulative benefits of knowledge transfer [would likely make it easier
to launch **retaliatory** attacks against the]{.underline} right
[aggressor and impose **unacceptable** costs]{.underline} more
successfully. Overall, [this would improve]{.underline} the credibility
of a **[deterrence]{.underline}**-by- punishment posture.

**[Furthermore]{.underline}**, [a **joint** capability]{.underline}
[would improve NATO's **offensive** cyber C2,]{.underline} [improving
attack **coordination** and mitigating **fratricide**]{.underline}. This
is because NATO's 'volunteer' system and its CyOC mark a striking
departure from the way it usually handles C2of members' assets.108 The
NATO Force Structure dictates that conventional forces like ships and
tanks come under the full operational control of an assigned NATO
commander.109 However, according to a retired USAF Colonel leading the
implementation of NATO's 2017 cyber policy, the C2 problems inherent in
the volunteer system make it 'far from ideal'.110 This is because [NATO
commanders do not know the details of capabilities available to
them]{.underline}, [such as their legal consequences]{.underline},
[**impeding** the decision-making process]{.underline}.111
[Commanders]{.underline} also [want to know how using cyberweapons might
**conflict** with other operations]{.underline}; [without this they are
left **'flying blind'**]{.underline}.112 [Failing to **coordinate**
operations can have **far-reaching** consequences]{.underline}. For
instance, intelligence agencies' [reconnaissance of target networks
needs to be coordinated with cyber-sabotage operations]{.underline}, [so
they do not **interfere**]{.underline} with each other.113
**[Disaggregated]{.underline}** [C2 can]{.underline} even [result in
**fratricide**]{.underline} [on other allies' networks]{.underline},
[because the distinction between internal and external security threats
is]{.underline} much [harder to **ascertain**]{.underline} [in
cyberspace]{.underline} than in the other four domains.114 The CyOC is a
step towards resolving this, but **[until a NATO commander has control
over members' capabilities]{.underline}**, [these **problems will not be
fully resolved**]{.underline}.

**[Additionally]{.underline}**, [a **unified** offensive
cyber]{.underline} C2 [structure]{.underline} [would aid scenario
planning]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [speed up
decision-making]{.underline}. This is important, because [NATO needs to
**streamline** its]{.underline} current decision-making
[process]{.underline} in the cyber domain.115 [A **single** command
would help members agree on **appropriate**]{.underline} forms of
[retaliation]{.underline} in cyberspace in different scenarios,
**[bolstering]{.underline}** the credibility of
**[deterrence]{.underline}**-by-punishment even further. [Without a
**clear** command structure]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline} very
[**difficult** for the 30 NATO allies]{.underline} -- [who have
**different** threat perceptions and suffer from a **lack** of
**cohesion**]{.underline} -- [to agree on effective
response]{.underline} scenarios in contingency planning.116 [As a case
in point]{.underline}, [**Estonia** is willing to strike back when
attacked online]{.underline}, given its memory of the 2007 attack and
its proximity to Russia.117 [However]{.underline}, Estonian officials
[do not know whether other allies will support them]{.underline},
validating some scholars' arguments that [NATO needs to find **common
ground** in cyber contingency planning]{.underline}.118 [The **secrecy**
that shrouds allies' capabilities and the **uncertainty**
surrounding]{.underline} cyber scenario [planning]{.underline} might
[explain why offensive cyber effects **do not feature** in
NATO]{.underline}'[s]{.underline} mission planning
[process]{.underline}.119 [This is not to say that NATO needs
to]{.underline} publicly [agree on a **'red line'** in cyberspace that
could trigger]{.underline} an [**A**rticle **5**]{.underline} response.
[If anything]{.underline}, NATO's current **[strategic
ambiguity]{.underline}** [is **key** for deterring attacks]{.underline}
that fall just below a defined threshold.120 However, [unifying cyber C2
would help them carry out scenario planning behind closed
doors]{.underline}, [improving the Alliance's
**readiness**]{.underline}. [Speeding up the decision-making process is
**crucial**]{.underline} [given how long it can take to **attribute**
and then **launch** a retaliatory attack]{.underline}.121 Overall,
streamlined scenario planning and decision- making, augmented by
improved coordination of cyberattacks, would strengthen the credibility
of deterrence-by-punishment. [Although aggressors]{.underline} like
Fancy Bear [would not know when a certain threshold has been
crossed]{.underline}, [it would **tilt** their risk-benefit **calculus**
knowing an attack could trigger a **faster**]{.underline},
[**well-coordinated** retaliatory attack]{.underline}.

### !! -- Russian Cyberattacks

[[Russia's]{.mark} state-supported [cyberattacks increased]{.mark} both
before and [during]{.mark} its invasion of
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [moves are part of Moscow's broader
attempt [to disrupt services and create
intimidation]{.mark}]{.underline} and confusion. [Up [until
now,]{.mark}]{.underline} however, the [[Kremlin has not launched a
devastating cyberwar against NATO]{.mark} countries]{.underline},
despite numerous warnings in recent months.

Western experts are still uncertain whether fears of American cyber
retaliation and the existence of a "Mutual Assured Cyber Destruction"
("cyber-MAD") are the reason why such attacks have not materialized. But
any [[further]{.mark} Western [sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(]{.mark}such as the European Union's declared oil embargo on Russia)
[will [increase the risk of **devastating** Russian

Shared targets

On May 10, 2022, the [European Union, United Kingdom and the United
States officially attributed a February 24 cyberattack to
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} One hour before the invasion of
Ukraine, [[hackers]{.underline}]{.mark} had targeted the Viasat-operated
KA-SAT satellite network to [[disrupt]{.mark} command and control of the
[Ukrainian]{.mark} military and government
[communications.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [disrupted internet access [caused **collateral damage** to]{.mark}
commercial and residential [internet]{.mark} services]{.underline}.
[Thousands of [modems **across Central Europe** lost]{.mark} their
[satellite connection]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Germany, [5,800 Enercon
[wind turbines could no longer be]{.mark} remotely [monitored]{.mark} by
their operators.]{.underline}

In 2015, Russia conducted its first deliberate cyberattack on Ukraine's
energy infrastructure and grid system.

Since the invasion, [[Russian attacks have become more frequent and
destructive]{.mark}. [They are coordinated with]{.mark} the Kremlin's
[military actions]{.mark}]{.underline} as part of its hybrid warfare
[[against]{.mark} both Ukraine and [the West]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its
[state-supported [hacker groups began preparing]{.mark} for the conflict
as early as March [2021]{.mark},]{.underline} according to new reports
on Russia's relentless cyberattacks as part of its hybrid warfare
against Ukraine. These cyber operations require careful planning,
targeting and development, which requires months if not years.

In recent years, both the U.S. and EU have intensified their
collaboration with Ukraine on cybersecurity. This is because [[Ukraine
has become a testing ground for]{.mark} Russia's advanced [cyberattacks
on critical infra]{.mark}structure]{.underline}, and the [**West can
learn much from Russian cyber strikes** against
Ukraine**.**]{.underline}

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

In 2015, Russia conducted its first deliberate cyberattack on Ukraine's
energy infrastructure and grid system. In 2017, the

financial, energy and government sectors in Ukraine[, **spread
internationally** and cost companies around the world]{.mark} over
**[\$10 billion]{.mark}**]{.underline} in damages.

For the EU, strengthening the cybersecurity of Ukraine's critical
infrastructure has become increasingly important since the Ukrainian
electricity grid is being integrated into the EU's common electricity
market and network (ENTSO-E).

[The rising [vulnerabilities of West]{.mark}ern societies and economies
have been [highlighted]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2020 [[after the hack of
a leading U.S. security tech company]{.underline}]{.mark} and its
software (SolarWinds). [[It gave]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n hacker group "Cozy Bear" (also called
"Nobelium" or APT-29) [access [to **thousands of companies'
data**]{.mark}, as well as [critical infrastructure in **various
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [targets of this hacker group are
believed to reflect the Kremlin's geopolitical interests and strategic
priorities]{.underline}. [[Cozy Bear]{.mark} has [increased]{.mark} its
[attacks]{.mark} against Ukraine [from]{.mark} a mere [six]{.mark} in
2021 [to]{.mark} more than [1,200]{.mark} this year]{.underline}, with
particular focus on the Ukrainian government and its state agencies.

There are also [lessons to be learned from the ransomware cyberattack
on]{.underline} the 8,000-kilometer [U.S. Colonial oil
pipeline.]{.underline} In May 2021, hackers infiltrated the company's
information technology infrastructure and were able to disable the
pipeline's operation. [The hack affected the oil supply for both private
consumers and U.S. Armed Forces, leading to panic buying]{.underline}.
The attackers stole nearly 100 gigabits of data and requested a ransom
of 75 Bitcoin (\$4.4 million at the time) to return access to the
company's billing system. The company eventually paid the ransom to the
cyber hacker group DarkSide, despite the government's efforts to prevent
this. In response, the Biden administration passed the Strengthening
American Cybersecurity Act (SACA) last March. It requires federal
agencies as well as owners and operators of critical infrastructure to
report cyberattacks within 72 hours and ransomware payments within 24
hours. But how to better mitigate threats and enhance resilience
collectively across industries and sectors is not addressed in the SACA.

Mutual escalation

[Since the war in Ukraine]{.underline} began, [[Russia's]{.mark}
state-backed [cyberattacks against Western critical infrastructure
**have increased** -- by]{.mark} as much as **[72
percent]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the U.K. Alongside ever more Western
sanctions and the increasing supply of heavy weaponry, [NATO countries
fear that [Russia could escalate]{.mark} its nascent cyberwar with
sophisticated strikes against critical infrastructure. NATO
governments]{.underline} and the European Central Bank have [repeatedly
warned that the West should be prepared for]{.underline} this
eventuality.

[The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network]{.underline} among the U.S.,
the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand [stated]{.underline} in April
that [[Russia was planning **massive cyberattacks** against
West]{.mark}ern countries supporting Ukraine.]{.underline} [A dozen
[hacking groups]{.mark}]{.underline} were designated as threats, since
they are part of, or close to, Russian intelligence and military
institutions. They [[have the ability to]{.mark} anonymously compromise
IT networks, steal large amounts of data, deploy destructive malware and
[bring down networks.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Last October, Microsoft warned in its 2021 Digital Defense Report that
[Russia was the state that posed the greatest cyber threat]{.underline}.
Russian hackers are considered much more prolific than those from China,
Iran and North Korea. In 2020, 58 percent of all state-backed
cyberattacks identified by Microsoft came from Russia. Cozy Bear
accounted for more than 92 percent of all detected Russian activity.
Microsoft also warned that its attacks targeting enterprise VPN software
have become up to 32 percent more successful. Attacks are mainly carried
out as espionage and intelligence campaigns against government agencies
and think tanks[. [The top target countries are the U.S.,]{.mark}
Ukraine, and the UK]{.underline}.

During its 2014 annexation of Crimea, Russia learned that it is much
more difficult to conduct a surgical cyber strike than an indiscriminate
one.

In March, the White House issued a strongly worded warning that [Russia
is planning major cyberattacks against the U.S. [in retaliation for its
harsh]{.mark} economic [sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In
April, a U.S. federal advisory warned that [hackers]{.underline} with
ties to foreign governments [are targeting specific industrial processes
and their information and control systems, including the supervisory
control and data acquisition devices to disrupt, sabotage and physically
destruct them.]{.underline}

Last June, U.S. President Joe Biden, embarrassed by the SolarWinds hack
and facing political pressure to retaliate against Russia, issued a
warning to President Vladimir Putin. At the first bilateral
cybersecurity summit since the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea in 2014,
Mr. Biden stated that 16 areas of critical infrastructure, including
energy, health and water, should be "off-limits to attack" by
cyberattacks or other means.

He also urged the Kremlin to take action against criminals conducting
ransomware attacks. But bilateral cybersecurity cooperation has not made
any significant progress since last summer. Illicit ransomware
activities by criminal groups appear to have continued unabated. The
trend goes hand in hand with the booming cryptocurrency industry, which
provides anonymous digital assets that can be used for money laundering.

'Cyber-MAD' and cyber deterrence

Alongside diplomatic efforts to de-escalate cyber tensions between the
West and Russia during the last few years, Western allies have warned
Russia of "massive consequences" for its largest banks and trading
companies in the case of escalating cyberwarfare against NATO and EU
countries.

[Despite Russia's undeniable offensive cyber capabilities, the Kremlin
has not initiated any larger devastating cyberwar against the West since
its military invasion began]{.underline} -- despite unprecedented
sanctions.

One explanation could be that both the U.S. and NATO have stated that a
highly damaging cyberattack on any member of the alliance could trigger
Article 5 of the treaty, which guarantees mutual defense. This could
indicate that some form of ["[cyber MAD"]{.mark} still functions between
the U.S. and Russia]{.underline}. Many [cyber [experts have
warned]{.mark} that the [West **cannot afford to bet on that** as a
deterrent.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, defining a more assertive cyber
retaliation strategy [[must]{.mark} also [consider]{.mark} the
possibility of [an escalatory spiral that could]{.mark} even [result in
Russia resorting to **use nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark},** even
perhaps preemptively.]{.underline}

During its 2014 annexation of Crimea, Russia learned that it is much
more difficult to conduct a surgical cyber strike than an indiscriminate
one. If the Kremlin decides to directly attack major Western
infrastructure, it will face retaliation. But the situation could also
escalate because Russia might not always be able to control its own
cyber operations on selected targets, potentially leading to unwanted
escalation and collateral damages far beyond what was initially
intended.

\[\[FIGURE OMITTED\]\]

Since the beginning of the war, Russia itself has become the target of
numerous international pro-Ukraine cyber groups and hackers, shattering
illusions of Moscow's cyber superiority. Cyberattacks on the Russian
government and military institutions have increased significantly. The
active Anonymous group has stolen hundreds of millions of documents from
governmental and industrial websites, including the Ministry of Defense.
Others have blocked or slowed freight trains carrying Russian military
equipment or tampered with the automatic ticket system for passengers.

Ukraine itself has built an "army" of IT volunteers (like Network
Battalion 65) to protect the country against Russian hackers, but also
to launch counter operations against Russian cyber threats. The
Ukrainian cybersecurity company Hacken claims that 10,000 hackers from
150 countries have volunteered to disrupt Russian media sites and
promote pro-Ukrainian messages across Russian social media.

But these international and private Ukrainian hacker groups have acted
without any kind of coordination, in contrast to Russia's
state-supported cyber groups controlled by the foreign intelligence
agency (SVR) or the military intelligence agency (GRU). Hence, [the
[impact of]{.mark} these [international cyberattacks against Russia has
yet **not been significant enough**]{.mark} to shift the Kremlin's
cost-benefit calculation of its invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}

Scenarios

Russia's red lines and escalation strategy could further change in the
weeks and months ahead. How the military, political and economic aspects
evolve, and war aims change will influence how the Kremlin decides to
use its cyber capabilities in the conflict.

Beyond the Russian-Ukrainian war, if adversarial threats increase, so
too will the vulnerabilities, as the world increasingly relies on
digital technology. In 2021, a record-breaking number of cyberattacks
took place -- a 50 percent increase from the previous year according to
the cybersecurity firm Check Point Research. New forecasts suggest that
2022 could be even worse. Cyber threats to civilian and military
critical infrastructure are likely to multiply and grow even more
consequential as the digital and physical worlds become increasingly
intertwined. While awareness of the need for cyber resilience has grown
in the West, it is too little to prevent disastrous cyberattacks on
critical infrastructure

political developments. (Nick Corbishley; \"The Russia-NATO Cyber War Is
Escalating Fast\"; naked capitalism;

Fears are rising that the [boundaries of the cyber war between Russia
and NATO could soon spread beyond Europe.]{.underline}

[Eight cybersecurity authorities from the]{.underline} so-called "[Five
Eye" nations (United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New
Zealand) released a joint statement on Thursday warning that **more
malicious** cyber activity is on the way as Russia's invasion of Ukraine
continues to undermine geopolitical stability.]{.underline}

Before we look at the statement in any depth, an important five-pronged
caveat is needed:

[Both the US and the UK are among the primary antagonists in NATO's
ongoing war with Russia]{.underline};

[They both have significant offensive cyber war capabilities of their
ow]{.underline}n;

US intelligence agencies, at Obama's behest, have drawn up a list of
potential overseas targets for cyber attacks;

[Both countries have surreptitiously conducted vast surveillance
programs]{.underline}, targeting not only their own populations but also
citizens and government leaders of other countries;

The [world right now is in the grip of the **biggest information war of
this century**]{.underline}.

As such, any information coming out of the Five Eyes' intelligence
services should be treated with a healthy dose of skepticism. That
having been said, here are the first three paragraphs of the missive:

The cybersecurity authorities of the United States, Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, and the United Kingdom are releasing this joint
Cybersecurity Advisory. The intent of this joint CSA is to warn
organizations that [Russia's invasion of Ukraine could expose
organizations both within and beyond the region to increased malicious
cyber activity]{.underline}. [This activity may occur as a response to
the **unprecedented economic costs imposed on Russia** as well as
materiel support provided by the United States and U.S. allies and
partners.]{.underline}

Evolving intelligence indicates that the [Russian government is
exploring options for potential cyberattacks]{.underline} (see the March
21, 2022, Statement by U.S. President Biden for more information).
Recent Russian state-sponsored cyber operations have included
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and older operations have
included deployment of destructive malware against Ukrainian government
and critical infrastructure organizations.

Additionally, some cybercrime groups have recently publicly pledged
support for the Russian government. These [Russian-aligned cybercrime
groups have threatened to conduct cyber operations in retaliation for
perceived cyber offensives against the Russian government]{.underline}
or the Russian people.

The document also emphasizes the frontline role likely to be played by
Russian state actors, including the Russian Federal Security Service
(FSB), the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Russian General
Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), GRU's Main Center for Special
Technologies (GTsST) and the Central Scientific Institute of Chemistry
and Mechanics (TsNIIKhM) of the Russian Ministry of Defense. Clearly,
Russia has the capability to launch a barrage of cyber attacks against
the west; the question is: does it want to?

The authors of the document urge critical infrastructure organizations
to take immediate steps to protect against cyberattacks. Those steps,
they say, should include patching known exploited vulnerabilities,
updating software, enforcing multi-factor authentication, securing and
monitoring remote desktop protocol (RDP) and other "potentially risky"
services, and providing end-user security awareness and training. As The
Register, a British technology news website, notes, if any of these
recommendations come as a surprise to critical infrastructure operators,
"we're screwed".

The warning from the "Five Eye" nations comes just days after NATO began
(as Bloomberg puts it) "the largest and most complex 'live-fire' cyber
defense exercises" ever conducted. More than 2,000 people from 32
nations were expected to participate in the war game, which began on
Tuesday in Tallinn, Estonia. They include representatives of five to 10
large global financial institutions, including Santander and Mastercard.

This is all happening as fears rise that the boundaries of the cyber war
between Russia and NATO could soon spread beyond Europe, where attacks
have been registered not only in Ukraine and Russia but also Poland and
Finland. On March 21, President Joe Biden warned American businesses to
prepare themselves for cyberattacks. Russia is likely to deploy cyber
attacks as a form of retaliation against US sanctions, Biden said,
adding that Russia has "a very sophisticated cyber capability," which
Putin "hasn't used... yet" but which forms "part of his playbook."

Cyber War Reaches Latin America?

Over the past week, two Latin American countries, Costa Rica and Puerto
Rico, have suffered major cyber attacks targeting key national
infrastructure. In Costa Rica a wave of attacks on Wednesday temporarily
disabled websites belonging to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunication, the Costa Rica
Social Security Fund, the National Meteorological Institute (IMN) and
the Costa Rican Radiographic Institute (Racsa).

Following the attack the Ministry of Science's Director of Digital
Governance, Jorge Mora, noted that the digitization of governmental
activities creates risks as well as benefits. As for who was
responsible, Mora said a US\$10 million ransom demand had been posted on
the dark web by the Conti Group, a pro-Russian ransomware gang that has
threatened to deploy retaliatory measures if cyberattacks are launched
against Russia. The Costa Rican government has ruled out paying a
ransom, which prompted Conti Group to issue one last ultimatum: pay up
or all the data gets released.

Costa Rica is a curious choice of target given the country, like Mexico,
follows a policy of neutrality regarding foreign wars. In fact, Costa
Rica has not had an army for 73 years. That said, the Costa Rican
government is one of a small number of Latin American countries to have
agreed to apply US and EU sanctions against Russia within its financial
system. It has also suspended broadcasts of Russian state-backed media
outlet RT.

Puerto Rico, being a so-called unincorporated territory of the United
States, is a more obvious choice of target. In the past few days the
country's electronic toll collection system was brought down by a cyber
attack. Local media reported Tuesday (April 19) that the attacks had
begun over the weekend and had affected a mobile application, the
collection systems at toll plazas, and a website. The website was up and
running again by Tuesday but users were still reporting service
irregularities as of this writing.

Puerto Rico's Interior Secretary Noelia García said the hackers have
demanded a ransom to restore the system, which the government says it
will not do. García also insisted that users' encrypted data such as
credit card details are safe. According to Ngai Oliveras, the Puerto
Rican government's chief of security, the FBI is investigating the
attack, which it is believed could be linked to the war in Ukraine.

This is not the first major cyber attack to target key public
infrastructure in Puerto Rico in recent months. In January, the website
of Puerto Rico's senate as well as its internet provider and telephone
systems were temporarily taken out. In October 2021, the capital's
electricity provider fell victim to a DDoS attack that resulted in a
power outage affecting more than a million people. In a DDoS attack
hackers inundate a website with so many bots connecting to it all at
once, they render it inaccessible. Servers are not breached, data is not
stolen but it can still cause lots of disruption.

The Digital Side of Russia-NATO War

Both sides of the NATO-Russia conflict took the battle to the cyber
sphere from day one. In the case of Russia, it has been attacking
Ukrainian targets since mid-January, weeks before the war even began. At
the very onset of its invasion of Ukraine, "U.[S. intelligence and
military cyber warriors were advocating the use of American cyberweapons
on a scale never before contemplated.]{.underline}" That was according
to a February 24 report out of NBC titled "Biden Has Been Presented with
Options for Massive Cyberattacks Against Russia."

In an interview with MSNBC two days earlier, Hilary Clinton praised
hacker group Anonymous' for launching coordinated cyber attacks on
Russian targets.

"There were reports overnight that Anonymous, a group of hackers, took
down Russian TV. I think that people who love freedom, who understand
that out way of life depends upon supporting those who believe in
freedom as well, could be engaged in cyber support for those in the
streets of Russia. We did some of that during the Arab Spring when I was
secretary of state. I think we could also be attacking a lot of the
government institutions, and you know the Oligarchs and their way of
life through cyber attacks."

The hacktivist group DDoSecrets, which specializes in hacking and then
publishing compromising data, has also been busy since the war began.
According to Micah Lee, an operational security analyst at The
Intercept, the group has so far amassed seven Russian datasets from
March and a further 20 from April. Among its targets are Roskomnadzor,
an agency that monitors and censors mass media; Transneft, the world's
largest oil pipeline company; Rosatom, the state nuclear energy agency;
the Russian Orthodox Church's charitable wing and the Russian Central
Bank.

On the other side of the conflict, cyber attacks have played a constant,
if somewhat muted, role in Russia's invasion. The targets in Ukraine
have included government websites; the mobile apps and ATMs of the
country's largest banks; and the websites of non-profit organizations,
tech companies, the Ukrainian military and Security Service (SBU).

"We are now witnessing the first real cyberwar," Natalia Tkachuk, the
head of Ukraine's Information Security and Cybersecurity Service, told
The Record, a cyber security news publication belonging to Recorded
Future, a Massachusetts-based cybersecurity firm:

\[M\]any cyber attacks on government institutions and critical
infrastructure are coordinated and planned by the Russians in order to
cause maximum damage to Ukraine. Most of the attacks are now aimed at
government agencies, energy, telecommunications and banking sectors. In
most cases, the main purpose of the attacks is to destroy information
using various data wiper malware.

We can't say that there is necessarily an increase in the number of the
attacks, rather we can note the increased coordination of efforts in the
preparation of attacks on a particular sector. Such targeted and
dangerous attacks come in waves, amid the static noise caused by a large
number of overall cyber incidents and small attacks.

Fake News and Bank Runs

Concerns are also rising about potential attacks on financial
institutions, particularly in Europe. On April 1, the European Banking
Authority issued a warning about the risk of fake news triggering a run
on European banks. Per Reuters:

"As market sentiment remains highly volatile and driven by news flow,
banks' liquidity levels can become vulnerable due to spread of
inaccurate information," the European Banking Authority said in its
latest "risk dashboard", which focused on exposures to Russia and
Ukraine.

"Such campaigns that spread inaccurate information may result in deposit
outflows from targeted banks," EBA said.

EBA said exposures of banks in the bloc to Russia are too low to
threaten financial stability, but economic fallout from the war in
Ukraine and cyber attacks could hit the profitability of lenders.

EU banks had exposures totalling 76 billion euros (\$84 billion) to
Russia and 11 billion euros to Ukraine in the fourth quarter of 2021,
mainly among Austrian, French and Italian lenders.

"Based on the EBA's initial assessment, direct exposures to Russia,
Belarus and Ukraine are limited, but second-round effects may be more
material from a financial stability perspective," it said.

Second-round effects include direct economic fallout of the war such as
the fiscal impact, the impact of sanctions, elevated risks from cyber
attacks, and the longer-term impact on supply chains in the global
economy, EBA said.

The EBA's warning bears a striking resemblance to a scenario featured in
a 10-country simulation of a major cyberattack organized by the Israeli
government in December 2021. As Reuters reported at the time, the
simulated cyber attack, dubbed "Collective Strength", took place over 10
days, "with sensitive data emerging on the Dark Web along with fake news
reports that ultimately caused chaos in global markets and a run on
banks."

Participants in the Collective Strength simulation included treasury
officials from Israel, the US, the UK, Austria, Switzerland, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates and Thailand, as well
as representatives of the IMF, the World Bank and the Bank of
International Settlements, the central bank of central banks. The
participants discussed a range of policies for responding to the
simulated crisis, including a coordinated bank holiday, debt repayment
grace periods, SWAP/REPO agreements and coordinated delinking from major
currencies.

The simulation took place after a string of cyber attacks last year
caused serious disruption to banks and other financial institutions in
Pakistan, Ecuador, New Zealand and Venezuela. Interestingly, Venezuela's
government laid the blame for the IT outage suffered by Banco de
Venezuela, the country's largest bank, on the US government, which
Venezuela's vice president Delcy Rodríguez accused of launching an
"intense and aggressive" cyber attack against the bank's IT system.

Cyber Attacks Were on the Rise Long Before Russia's Invasion of Ukraine

Cyber attacks have been a growing problem for a number of years as more
and more aspects of human communication, work and business operations
have migrated online, particularly following the pandemic-induced
lockdowns of 2020. Ransomware-related data breaches have doubled in the
US for the past two years, according to the Identity Theft Resource
Center's 16th Annual Data Breach Report. Supply chain attacks, like
DarkSide's ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, are also on the rise.

There are many reasons for this. One is that large companies that fall
victim to ransom attacks tend to pay up. And the ransoms tend to be big.
Colonial Pipeline paid a \$4.4 million ransom payment to regain access
to its files.

The rising threat is also being driven by the increasing technological
sophistication and capability of hackers. At the same time, banks and
companies' IT systems have grown more vulnerable due to the explosion in
use of electronic financial services during the pandemic as well as the
rise in remote working by employees, as reader Vlade commented on a
previous article:

The problem with the home front is that most people are treating home IT
as "just put it there", and not thinking about security until it's way
too late. Using open wifi, not changing default passwords or admin users
etc. etc. -- but TBH, I have seen the same behaviour within large corpos
too.

Still by far the easiest hacking attack is via a mole (i.e. human
element), and that's very hard to prevent. And, as they are right now,
since the companies are looking at their employees as interchangeable
cogs in a machine, recruiting moles is likely getting easier and easier.

This may well have been the case with the recent cyber attack against
Colonial pipeline, which took down the largest fuel pipeline in the
country, leading to fuel shortages along the East Coast, and was pulled
off with a single compromised password.

US Infrastructure At Risk?

As Russia gets bogged down in its war with Ukraine (and, of course, NATO
& friends) and its sanctions-ravaged economy spirals deeper and deeper
into depression, an increasingly desperate Vladimir Putin may resort to
digital warfare against US targets. That is the scenario being depicted
by some mainstream media outlets. A recent CBS News report, citing the
same US intelligence officials that helped produce the Five Eyes
missive, warns that cyber attacks against US infrastructure are growing
increasingly likely.

"We have to assume that there's going to be a breach," said Jen
Easterly, US Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA), a US federal agency that operates under Department of
Homeland Security oversight. "There's going to be an incident."

Caveat #2: US intelligence agencies are not exactly the most reliable
sources of information. Intelligence officials already told a big porky
when they recently warned that Russia might be preparing to use chemical
agents in Ukraine. As it turns out, they had no evidence Russia had
brought any chemical weapons near Ukraine; they were apparently just
trying to deter Russia from using the banned munitions. This is part and
parcel of Washington/NATO's disinformation war against Russia, as even
NBC News recently admitted:

It's one of a string of examples of the Biden administration's breaking
with recent precedent by deploying declassified intelligence as part of
an information war against Russia. The administration has done so even
when the intelligence wasn't rock solid, officials said, to keep Russian
President Vladimir Putin off balance.

In other words, they lied, just as they lied about Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction. As Caitlin Johnstone notes in an article for
Consortium News, they may contend that they lied for a noble reason but
they still lied: "They knowingly circulated information they had no
reason to believe was true, and that lie was amplified by all the most
influential media outlets in the western world."

Now, we are being told by the intelligence agencies of not only the US
but also its fellow Five Eye partners that a Russian cyber attack
against critical infrastructure is all but inevitable. But as I noted at
the beginning of this article, they are not exactly trusted sources.

NATO's Role in the Global Commons

NATO can only be as effective as its member states allow it to be. [NATO
reflects the state of transatlantic relations]{.underline}: [are US and
European security outlooks sufficiently compatible such that the
alliance is able to address threats from China
collectively?]{.underline} This question is reflected in how well they
manage to define common challenges and establish mechanisms that allow
them to address these challenges together. [NATO was a natural center of
security focus for Washington when Europe was the main arena for
US-Soviet deterrence]{.underline}. Today, the [Indo-Pacific competes for
US attention and resources as competition with China has moved to the
center stage of US security and defense priorities.]{.underline}

The [strategic shift in US priorities does not mean that Europe cannot
continue to remain a significant influence on global security
dynamics.]{.underline} The [EU has demonstrated its continued
relevance]{.underline} in the security realm, not merely by relying on
its role as a major trade bloc, but also [by reforming the interplay
between member states and EU institutions to avoid being paralyzed by
consensus requirements]{.underline}, which apply in most areas outside
the trade sector. This is done by providing platforms for member states
to start initiatives. If successful in attracting support within the
union, the initiatives are consolidated by supportive mechanisms and
programs.43

[NATO is not the EU and hence should not duplicate its
methods]{.underline}. The EU is driven by the urge to secure the
continued influence of its member states on major global issues. NATO's
raison d'être is to facilitate transatlantic cooperation in the military
sector to counter common threats and challenges[. Coordination is
complex at a time when US and European security outlooks are drifting
apart in terms of threat perceptions and priorities]{.underline}. At the
same time, [fears of entrapment stifle NATO's efforts to update its
relevance]{.underline}, principally because key members such as France
and Germany are not interested in NATO taking on China as a threat.

Nevertheless, [NATO's agreement to define China as a challenge promises
opportunities for positioning the alliance in a key role in
transatlantic relations]{.underline}. Because [cyber]{.underline} and
space encompass threats from other adversaries such as Russia and Iran,
these [domains are a good place to start taking on China as they do not
require that China be singled out as a threa]{.underline}t[. By taking
on the responsibility for coordinating US and European definitions of
cyber]{.underline} and outer space [threats in the military sector,
integrating these domains in all organizational and operational NATO
structures, devising mechanisms for the member states to address
cyber]{.underline} and outer space [threats, and by facilitating
intelligence exchange and management of the vulnerabilities]{.underline}
produced by civil-military interaction and overlapping interfaces
between the cyber and space sectors, [NATO can demonstrate its continued
relevance for transatlantic security]{.underline} in an era where
threats are increasingly global and transcend geographical boundaries.
There's no time like the present.

NATO's vague recognition in 2021 that China constitutes a challenge to
the transatlantic alliance reflects an institution that has failed to
take on the security threats emanating from Beijing. Russia's invasion
of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 highlights the reasons why this omission
is problematic. The war in Ukraine has reignited transatlantic unity of
purpose in addressing threats from Moscow toward European security. The
existential shock that Europe is facing now that a Russian regime has
shown itself willing to go to war against European countries carries
with it the risk that China will be forgotten when NATO discusses its
future priorities. During the war, China is walking a tightrope between
maintaining its commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity and
keeping up cooperation with Russia. The future strength of the
Chinese-Russian partnership is likely to be determined by the continued
usefulness of Moscow in China's efforts to carve out more space for a
Sinocentric international order based on authoritarian regimes.
Meanwhile, China will continue to engender threats to the US and Europe
in all domains and across geographical regions.

With the summit statement of the North Atlantic Council released June
14, 2021, NATO extended a commitment to "engage China with a view to
defending the security interests of the Alliance," since "China's stated
ambitions and assertive behavior present systemic challenges to the
rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance
security."1 China's coercive policies, nuclear arsenal, military
modernization, military cooperation with Russia, lack of transparency,
and use of disinformation are listed as main areas of concern for the
alliance. NATO takes the China challenge seriously but has yet to devise
a strategy to address it.

NATO takes the China challenge seriously but has yet to devise a
strategy to address it

Compared to the United States, Europe took a long time to acknowledge
its stake in managing security challenges from China. As Beijing pushed
beyond its traditional zones of interest in East and Southeast Asia
toward the Indian Ocean in the 2000s, US security policies began to
focus more on China as Washington sought a new geopolitical equilibrium
in Asia.2 Since 2014, France and the UK have spearheaded Europe's naval
diplomacy to counter the displays of force and increasing tensions in
maritime Asia to which China contributes. This engagement has focused on
regular exercises with the US and its Asian allies, operations in
support of freedom of navigation, and base-sharing agreements.3 In 2021,
the EU recognized that these geopolitical dynamics directly impact its
security and announced the establishment of supportive mechanisms in its
Indo-Pacific strategy.4 However, NATO has been conspicuously absent in
these transatlantic endeavors designed to counter challenges to US and
European security. Reflecting NATO's absence from the main arena of
US-China strategic competition, the alliance is hardly ever mentioned in
off-the-record conversations on Indo-Pacific security between diplomats
and think tank personnel.

NATO's reluctance to take on the China challenge is perhaps not
surprising, given its inherent assumption that the European continent is
the jewel in the crown of the US alliance system, which is thought to
guarantee US assistance in the event of a military threat against
Europe. This assumption was challenged during the Trump administration,
which openly questioned the US commitment to Article Five's collective
defense obligation. The invasion of Ukraine has given NATO a new lease
on life and put it at the frontlines of transatlantic cooperation on
deterring Russia from further military action in future. However, NATO's
focus on its eastern frontline carries the risk that the alliance turns
into a Russia-focused European institution and ignores that China is a
global great power competitor which also constitutes a major challenge
to the security of all NATO member states.

Washington increasingly looks to the EU rather than NATO for guidance on
Europe's future security policy. One reason is that NATO's toolbox is
lagging in domains such as cyber and outer space, although cyber and
outer space operations are key enablers of actions in all domains
including air, sea, and land. One indication of this is the US-EU
negotiations surrounding a common response to cyber threats which took
place during the first US-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) meeting
in Pittsburgh in September 2021. In addition, during Trump's presidency,
longstanding US dissatisfaction with Europe's modest defense spending
threatened to put NATO on the backburner in transatlantic security
debates.5 Since then, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has elicited a sea
change in German defense policy with the announcement in February 2022
that defense spending will increase to more than 2 percent of its gross
domestic output annually.6 While this may be a convincing signal that
Europe will finally devote the resources required for its own defense
and revive NATO's central role in transatlantic security, there is also
a risk that China will be moved to the periphery of the alliance's
agenda.

On February 11, 2022, during the runup to the Russian-Ukrainian war, the
Biden administration published its Indo-Pacific strategy as US Secretary
of State Anthony Blinken was in the midst of a Pacific trip to
Australia, Fiji, and Hawaii.7 This US prioritization signaled that
despite Moscow's war in Europe, Washington remains committed to
strengthening its presence in the Indo-Pacific and competing with China.
If the US drops the ball on the Indo-Pacific, Washington is concerned
that China might use force against Taiwan.8 Consequently, the key
question for the US is how many resources can be tied up in Europe
without losing sight of the long-term goal: deterrence of China. As US
strategic competition with China increases while NATO is sitting on the
fence, failure to develop a transatlantic defense policy that addresses
China will leave Europe vulnerable to China's ability to exploit the
weak links in European defense arrangements, which are newly fragmented
by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.9

EU efforts to build an independent regional defense profile and nurture
cooperation between Europe's defense industry and national defense
communities reflect a growing recognition that the region needs to
become a self-reliant defense actor. However, Europe still needs to
demonstrate that self-reliance does not imply merely focusing on
Europe's periphery. Otherwise, the industrial challenges from China may
outcompete Europe's defense industry. Shipbuilding is a case in point.
By 2021, China built 50 percent of all existing ships in the world.
Through design collaboration agreements, cyber espionage, and
acquisitions, China has copied advanced innovative ship designs.
Enormous financial resources from the state allow Chinese companies to
enjoy economies of scale by building dual-use factories which not only
outcompete Western companies in the commercial shipbuilding industry,
but also threaten the production of navy vessels. If not taken
seriously, Europe and the US may soon have no choice but to buy frigates
from China.10 This example demonstrates the centrality of China for
global economic and security developments and should encourage Europe to
manifest a position of unified strength in defending NATO member states
against Chinese security challenges. This realization will help convince
the US and its adversaries that Europe continues to be a credible
partner in countering common threats against transatlantic security,
whether they appear in or beyond the European region.

China's challenges to US and European security constitute such common
threats across a broad range of sectors. These include gradual
reinterpretations of principles of international law, the subversion of
universal liberal market economic practices, and cyber insurgencies
targeting a wide range of civilian and military entities. These Chinese
policies all have major military implications because they are related
to developments in the operating principles, capabilities, and
priorities of China's armed forces. Only NATO can offer an integrated
transatlantic response to the military aspects of Chinese policies that
threaten those sectors across the globe, including European actors.
NATO's involvement is essential if the credibility of the alliance's
security guarantees is to be preserved and an effective response to
China's encroachments on a liberal rules-based order is to be
established.

NATO's involvement is essential to establish an effective response to
China

The omnipresent character of the China threat demonstrates that it is
long overdue for NATO to position itself as a significant player in
addressing Beijing's challenges to transatlantic security. NATO is key
to keeping US and European security policies coordinated when applying
mechanisms of deterrence and defense against Chinese challenges. If
transatlantic unity of purpose is lost, both the US and Europe are far
less likely to succeed in addressing China sufficiently.

Apart from the diplomatic approach with China, [[NATO should ensure its

another]{.underline}. As mentioned above, [[resources differ]{.mark}

### !! - Nuke War

#### Nuke war could cause human extinction and destroy biosphere

**Lynas 22** British author and journalist who has written multiple
books on the environment and climate change, Mark Lynas, 03/10/2022,

Russia?",

(JB)

If global nuclear famine could result from just 100 nuclear detonations,
what might be the result of a fuller exchange of the several thousand
warheads held in current inventories by the US and Russia?

[[One 2008 study](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3047679) looked at a
Russia-US nuclear war scenario, where Russia would target 2,200 weapons
on Western countries and the US would target 1,100 weapons each on China
and Russia.]{.underline} In total, therefore, 4,400 warheads detonate,
equivalent to roughly half the current inventories held each by Russia
and the US.

Nuclear weapons held by other states were not used in this scenario,
which has a 440-Mt explosive yield, equivalent to about 150 times all
the bombs detonated in World War II. [This [full-scale nuclear
war]{.mark} was [estimated to cause **770 million direct deaths and
generate 180 Tg of soot**]{.mark} from burning cities and
forests]{.underline}. In the US, about half the population would be
within 5km of a ground zero, and a fifth of the country's citizens would
be killed outright.

A [[subsequent
study]{.underline}](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD030509),
published in 2019, looked at a comparable but slightly lower 150 Tg
atmospheric soot injection following an equivalent scale nuclear war.
[The devastation [causes]{.mark} so much smoke that **[only 30-40
percent of sunlight reach]{.mark}es the [Earth's surface for the
subsequent six months]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A massive drop in temperature follows, with the weather staying below
freezing throughout the subsequent Northern Hemisphere summer. In Iowa,
for example, [the **[model shows temperatures staying below 0°C for 730
days]{.mark} straight**]{.underline}. There is no growing season. This
is a true nuclear winter.

Nor is it just a short blip. Temperatures still drop below freezing in
summer for several years thereafter, and global precipitation falls by
half by years three and four. It takes over a decade for anything like
climatic normality to return to the planet.

By this time, [most of Earth's human population will be long dead. The
[**world's food production would crash by more than 90 percent**,
causing [global
famine](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-830419/v1)]{.mark} that
**[would kill billions]{.mark}**]{.underline} by starvation. In most
countries less than a quarter of the population survives by the end of
year two in this scenario. Global fish stocks [[are
decimated]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008256117)
and the [[ozone layer
collapses]{.underline}](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JD035079).

The models are [[eerily
specific]{.underline}](https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-830419/v1/7c33234ad24f7e3c3e83b9ec.pdf).
In the 4,400 warhead/150 Tg soot nuclear war scenario, averaged over the
subsequent five years, China sees a reduction in food calories of 97.2
percent, France by 97.5 percent, Russia by 99.7 percent, the UK by 99.5
percent and the US by 98.9 percent. [In all these countries, virtually
[**everyone who survived** the initial blasts **would**]{.mark}
subsequently **[starve]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### !! -- Hybrid War

#### Hybrid War happening now and will escalate

**Polyakova & Boulègue** (Alina Polyakova President and CEO of CEPA,
Mathieu Boulègue Senior Research Fellow Russia & Eurasia Programme at
Chatham House), 1/29/21, accessed 6/24/22, "THe Evolution of Russian
Hybrid Warfare: Executive Summary",
[[https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-introduction/]{.underline}](https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-introduction/)
(JB)

Russia's military interventions in Syria, Venezuela, and, more recently,
Libya raise the question whether the Kremlin is still being
opportunistic or whether it has revised its military strategy to better
project force around the globe based on a single playbook. These
interventions have taken advantage of preexisting chaos and weakness
that Russia did not directly cause. Together with its growing
conventional power, [[Russia]{.mark} is now far more [confident about
**using hard power in the hybrid mix.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The aforementioned changes in Russian military thinking reflect a
reinvigorated confidence in the efficacy of chaos as a competitive
strategy. If anything, the [**Kremlin leadership feels vindicated about
the usefulness of hard power options**, while categorizing nonmilitary
means as a tool to prepare conflict environments and make the use of
force more
effective.[19](https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-introduction/#footnote_18_7492)]{.underline}
This is best exemplified by Kalev Stoicescu's chapter on Estonia, where
the threat of Russia's military action cannot be dissociated from hybrid
tools aimed at testing the country's resolve below the threshold of
Article V of NATO's founding treaty, which commits the Alliance to
collective defense.

Among the drivers of change in Russian thinking, disappointment and
unexpected outcomes have been some of the most powerful. As Kateryna
Zarembo and Sergiy Solodkyy show, this is most notably the case with
low-intensity military operations in Ukraine: difficulty in upholding a
degree of "plausible deniability" of direct military intervention; war
fatigue; issues with managing proxy groups and local militia; the
failure of "Novorossiya" and other ideological products in
Ukraine;[[20]{.underline}](https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-introduction/#footnote_19_7492)
the absence of an exit strategy in the Donbas, etc. [Russia]{.underline}
has now altered its originally ambitious aim (to control Crimea and the
Donbas) in favor of [perpetuating a persistent, low-scale conflict that
will impede Ukraine's integration into Western security
structures]{.underline}.[[21]{.underline}](https://cepa.org/the-evolution-of-russian-hybrid-warfare-introduction/#footnote_20_7492)

Further afield, in the United Kingdom, Precious Chatterje-Doody explores
how **[[Russian hybrid operations]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- mainly
information operations --- [have been [**adapting** in order **to
infiltrate networks, destabilize internal norms,**]{.mark} and
ultimately create an environment conducive to Russian
interests]{.underline}. Oscar Jonsson outlines Russian tactical
adaptations in the EU and NATO, where [[Russian **hybrid tools**]{.mark}
**are [used to increase political polarization]{.mark}** [and challenge
institutional cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[Chaos strategy through hybrid]{.underline}]{.mark}, multi-vector
[[warfare]{.mark} is [here to stay]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[[consequences of this are]{.underline}]{.mark} many and unwanted, and
notably include [[the **potential for miscalculation with the
West**]{.underline}]{.mark}. To avoid such a situation, [**[U.S. experts
and leaders can learn]{.mark}** much [**from** the knowledge and
experiences of **allies and partner states in
Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- countries and institutions which have
long been contending with the most aggressive forms of Russia's hybrid
warfare.

(JB)

As [**[Russia]{.mark} has evolved to increasingly [rely on hybrid
warfare]{.mark}** [as a major component of its
strategy,]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}NATO must adapt accordingly.
[**[NATO's model must shift]{.mark}** from a reliance on traditional
military deterrence and expand to incorporate political, economic, and
social spheres [to counter aggression below the level of armed
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since NATO's structure does not readily
support innovation or active (versus passive) deterrence measures, new
ideas and emphases are needed to address these challenges.

Pursuing activities to deter hybrid warfare certainly poses risks and
challenges to NATO and its member states and partners. Activities in
these spheres might risk further blurring lines between military and
nonmilitary responsibilities. Individual member laws and EU regulations
might complicate these efforts. Civil institutions could be at risk of
being identified as military targets in the event of a linear war.

Consequently, [[**Allies and partners must update their methods** to
better deter Russian aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} by reducing
Russia's strategic options and increasing their own ability to impose
costs. Imposition of costs via Allies' domains of diplomatic,
information, military, and economic levers are central to changing
Russia's cost-benefit assessment regarding hybrid warfare and enabling
deterrence. Doing [[this could be achieved through]{.underline}]{.mark}
such concepts as [comprehensive defense, **[improved IO, and expanded
allied member and partner collaboration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While
the overall goal of maintaining Alliance unity and solidarity remains
the same, the [means and ways through which Allies and partners
achieve]{.underline} that [goal should change]{.underline}. This
includes embracing the diversity of members' strengths and capabilities
and exploring increased partnerships with non-NATO members to leverage
and learn from their experience with Russian hybrid warfare aggression.

### !! - Meltdown

#### Threat of meltdown from cyberattacks is high and increasing 

Dr. Page **Stoutland 18**, Consultant of Scientific and Technical
Affairs to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, B.S. from St. Olaf College,
Ph.D in Chemistry from University of California Berkeley, "Cyberattacks
on Nuclear Power Plants", The Nuclear Threat Initiative, 3/19/2018,
https://www.nti.org/atomic-pulse/cyberattacks-nuclear-power-plants-how-worried-should-we-be/
Accessed 24 June 22

The New York Times reported last week on a U.S. government report
accusing Russia of conducting a series of cyberattacks aimed at U.S. and
European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems from 2015
through 2017. In addition to attacks on water and electric plants,
[publicly available evidence suggests that Russia infiltrated the
business systems of the Burlington, Kan., Wolf Creek nuclear plant but
not the plant's control systems.]{.underline} It was not clear whether
the goal of the attack was to conduct reconnaissance or, more seriously,
some type of sabotage.

Needless to say, [any type of attack on a nuclear plant is very
concerning. [An attack that allows hackers to manipulate]{.mark} the
[systems that control a nuclear reactor]{.mark}, while very difficult,
[could have]{.mark} very [serious]{.mark} [consequences,
including]{.mark} potentially [nuclear reactor core damage and off-site
release of radiation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This is not the first time that nuclear facilities have been attacked.
The most well-known example is the Stuxnet attack]{.underline} on Iran's
uranium enrichment facility, generally attributed to the U.S. and Israel
(for a summary of attacks on nuclear facilities, click here.

Very recently, [[a new piece of dangerous malware, TRISIS, which]{.mark}
specifically [targets]{.mark} the [industrial controllers]{.mark} used
for safety critical applications, including [in nuclear plants, has been
found]{.mark} in the Middle East.]{.underline}

So how worried should we be?

The good news is that the safety and security of nuclear facilities is
taken very seriously. In the United States, cyber security at nuclear
facilities is receiving increased attention from regulators, plant
operators and technical experts. In addition, as the United States has
an aging nuclear infrastructure, many of the plants are still operating
mostly with analog controls and/or safety systems, meaning they are less
vulnerable to cyberattacks.

Unfortunately, this attention to the cyber threat does not exist
everywhere. [[A 2016]{.mark} NTI [study found]{.mark} that
[nearly]{.mark} [half of the countries with relevant nuclear facilities
had no regulations for cyber security]{.mark} at those
facilities.]{.underline}

**[Looking forward, there are a number of concerning
signs.]{.underline}**

[As recent attacks have confirmed, [cyberattacks are getting
increasingly sophisticated]{.mark}.]{.underline} Complex attacks are no
longer just the purview of nations but can now be conducted by smaller
groups. Furthermore, [systems which may have been analog at one time are
increasingly digital and increasingly complex]{.underline}. The growing
Internet-of-Things will present additional challenges.

Responding to this growing threat is not easy. [[Airgaps, originally
designed to counter]{.mark} untargeted [attacks]{.mark}, [are not
effective]{.mark} against a determined adversary**. [Existing safety
systems may not be effective against cyberattacks that can lead to
failures that would never occur naturally]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Furthermore, threats do not just arise from the internet---defenders
must consider supply chain risks and the potential for insider threat.

NTI is increasingly focused on this area. NTI's 2016 study concluded [in
the release of [a report]{.mark}]{.underline}, Outpacing Cyber Threats:
Priorities for Cybersecurity at Nuclear Facilities,[that [summarized the
key pillars of a new strategy,]{.mark} urging operators to address
fundamental issues such as system complexity and [promoting **the
importance of an active defense.**]{.mark} **The report also highlighted
the importance of developing transformational approaches**]{.underline}
(perhaps new, non-programmable solutions) that would be immune to
cyberattacks. In addition to the need for a more robust strategy, the
current shortfalls in global technical capacity must be addressed,
perhaps by improving means to provide international assistance.

**[The cyber threat to nuclear facilities is serious,]{.underline}** but
the challenge going forward is evident. [Threats and vulnerabilities
will continue to mount.]{.underline} Today's strategy is not
sufficiently robust or scalable, and a high level of cyber security may
never be compatible with current nuclear plant business models.
[[Governments]{.mark}, regulators, facility operators, vendors, and
experts [need to accelerate]{.mark} our [efforts to develop new
approaches that can scale to]{.mark} the [threats of the
future.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Cyberattacks on nuclear power plants are devastating

Dakota State University, Ph.D. in Scientific Computing, M.S., M.B.A.,

to a Nuclear Weapon," The Conversation, 8/16/2019,
http://theconversation.com/a-cyberattack-could-wreak-destruction-comparable-to-a-nuclear-weapon-112173,
Accessed 24 June 22

[[People]{.underline}]{.mark} around the world may be [[worried about
nuclear tensions]{.mark} rising, but]{.underline} I think [**they're
[miss]{.mark}ing [the fact that a major cyberattack could be just as
damaging]{.mark}** -- and hackers are already laying the
groundwork.]{.underline}

With the U.S. and Russia pulling out of a key nuclear weapons pact --
and beginning to develop new nuclear weapons -- plus Iran tensions and
North Korea again test-launching missiles, the global threat to
civilization is high. Some fear a new nuclear arms race.

That threat is serious -- but another could be as serious, and is less
visible to the public. So far, most of the well-known hacking incidents,
even those with foreign government backing, have done little more than
steal data. [Unfortunately, there are signs that hackers have placed
malicious software inside U.S. power and water systems, where it's lying
in wait, ready to be triggered. The U.S. military has also reportedly
penetrated the computers that control Russian electrical
systems.]{.underline}

Many intrusions already

As someone who studies cybersecurity and information warfare, I'm
concerned that **[[a cyberattack with widespread impact,]{.mark} an
intrusion in one area that spreads to others or a combination of lots of
smaller attacks, [could cause significant damage, including mass injury
and death rivaling the death toll of a nuclear
weapon.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Unlike a nuclear weapon, which would vaporize people within 100 feet and
kill almost everyone within a half-mile[, the death toll from most
cyberattacks would be slower. People might die from a lack of food,
power or gas for heat or from car crashes resulting from a corrupted
traffic light system. This could happen over a wide area, resulting in
mass injury and even deaths.]{.underline}

This might sound alarmist, but look at what has been happening in recent
years, in the U.S. and around the world.

[In early 2016, hackers took control of a U.S. treatment plant for
drinking water, and changed the chemical mixture used to purify the
water.]{.underline} If changes had been made -- and gone unnoticed --
this could have led to poisonings, an unusable water supply and a lack
of water.

[In 2016 and 2017, hackers shut down major sections of the power grid in
Ukraine]{.underline}. This attack was milder than it could have been, as
no equipment was destroyed during it, despite the ability to do so.
Officials think it was designed to send a message. [In 2018, unknown
cybercriminals gained access throughout the United Kingdom's electricity
system; in 2019 a similar incursion may have penetrated the U.S.
grid.]{.underline}

[In August 2017, a Saudi Arabian petrochemical plant was hit by hackers
who tried to blow up equipment]{.underline} by taking control of the
same types of electronics used in industrial facilities of all kinds
throughout the world. Just [a few months later, hackers shut down
monitoring systems for oil and gas pipelines across the
U.S.]{.underline} This primarily caused logistical problems -- but it
showed how an insecure contractor's systems could potentially cause
problems for primary ones.

The FBI has even warned that hackers are targeting nuclear facilities.
**[[A compromised nuclear facility could result in the discharge of
radioactive material, chemicals or]{.mark} even possibly [a]{.mark}
reactor [meltdown]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [A cyberattack could cause an
event similar to the incident in Chernobyl. That explosion, caused by
inadvertent error, resulted in 50 deaths and evacuation of 120,000 and
has left parts of the region uninhabitable for thousands of years into
the future.]{.underline}

Mutual assured destruction

My concern is not intended to downplay the devastating and immediate
effects of a nuclear attack. Rather, it's to point out that some of
**[[the]{.mark} [international protections against nuclear conflicts
don't exist for cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance, the
idea of "mutual assured destruction" suggests that no country should
launch a nuclear weapon at another nuclear-armed nation: The launch
would likely be detected, and the target nation would launch its own
weapons in response, destroying both nations.

Cyberattackers have fewer inhibitions. [For one thing, it's much easier
to disguise the source of a digital incursion than it is to hide where a
missile blasted off from. Further, cyberwarfare can start small,
targeting even a single phone or laptop]{.underline}. Larger attacks
might target businesses, such as banks or hotels, or a government
agency. But those aren't enough to escalate a conflict to the nuclear
scale.

Nuclear grade cyberattacks

There are three basic scenarios for how a nuclear grade cyberattack
might develop. It could start modestly, with one country's intelligence
service stealing, deleting or compromising another nation's military
data. Successive rounds of retaliation could expand the scope of the
attacks and the severity of the damage to civilian life.

In another situation, [a nation or a terrorist organization could
unleash a massively destructive cyberattack -- targeting several
electricity utilities, water treatment facilities or industrial plants
at once, or in combination with each other to compound the
damage.]{.underline}

Perhaps the most concerning possibility, though, is that it might happen
by mistake. On several occasions, human and mechanical errors very
nearly destroyed the world during the Cold War; something analogous
could happen in the software and hardware of the digital realm.

Defending against disaster

Just as there is no way to completely protect against a nuclear attack,
there are only ways to make devastating cyberattacks less likely.

The first is that governments, businesses and regular people need to
secure their systems to prevent outside intruders from finding their way
in, and then exploiting their connections and access to dive deeper.

Critical systems, like those at public utilities, transportation
companies and firms that use hazardous chemicals, need to be much more
secure. [One analysis found that [only]{.mark} about [one-fifth of
companies that use computers to control industrial machinery]{.mark} in
the U.S. [even monitor their equipment to detect potential
attacks]{.mark} **-- and that in 40% of the attacks they did catch, the
intruder had been accessing the system for more than a
year.**]{.underline} Another survey found that nearly three-quarters of
energy companies had experienced some sort of network intrusion in the
previous year.

But all those systems can't be protected without skilled cybersecurity
staffs to handle the work. At present, nearly a quarter of all
cybersecurity jobs in the U.S. are vacant, with more positions opening
up than there are people to fill them. One recruiter has expressed
concern that even some of the jobs that are filled are held by people
who aren't qualified to do them. The solution is more training and
education, to teach people the skills they need to do cybersecurity
work, and to keep existing workers up to date on the latest threats and
defense strategies.

Joint Offensive Cyber Capabilities and Cyber Deterrence-by-Punishment

[It is necessary to explain the **limitations** of NATO's [current
**deterrence-by-denial**]{.mark} policy]{.underline} to contextualise
cyber deterrence-by-punishment. After all, one may ask: why not just
bolster [NATO's cyber defences]{.underline}? While defensive measures
are absolutely essential for stopping attacks that have already
launched, they [are [severely **limited at deterring** potential
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}. This probably explains why NATO does not
mention 'cyber deterrence-by-denial' in its policy documents, but rather
cyber- deterrence more broadly.74 [The **[main problem]{.mark}** with
deterrence-by-denial [is that cyberattacks are]{.mark}]{.underline} very
[**[low cost]{.mark}** for an aggressor]{.underline}, both [in terms of
the effort expended to launch an attack]{.underline} [and the cost of
penalties]{.underline}.75 [The existence of [a **huge black market**
offering]{.mark}]{.underline} everything from **[[zero-day
exploits]{.underline}]{.mark}** to off-the-shelf services to conduct
DDoS attacks facilitates the ease with which cyberattack technology can
be acquired.76 Meanwhile, [[the **lack** of]{.mark} an
**[inspection]{.mark}** regime]{.underline} [[and the **infancy**
of]{.mark} international legal **[frameworks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
reduces the risk of penalties.77 This [[gives aggressors **little
incentive to stop** attacking]{.underline}]{.mark}, even in the face of
strong defences.

Meanwhile, defence in cyberspace is porous in nature.78 Every system has
vulnerabilities and exploiting them is only a matter of time, means and
determination.79 This permeability is a serious problem, because
defenders must convince aggressors that an attack will have little to no
effect for deterrence-by-denial to be effective.80 NATO's
deterrence-by-denial posture certainly makes attacks harder to conduct,
but this has not deterred the hundreds of significant attacks it faces
monthly. Clearly, a discussion over cyber deterrence-by- punishment is
warranted.

[The cyber **[deterrence-by-punishment]{.mark}** that offensive weapons
afford]{.underline} serves [to **[bolster]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
complement **[[deterrence]{.mark}-by-denial]{.underline}**. This is
because [[it **threatens** the imposition of **costs**
where]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[in the absence of
retaliation]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[there would be hardly
any]{.underline}]{.mark}.

With [little chance of improved NATO-Russian relations any time soon,
**time is of the essence** to get this right. The allies should begin
the hard political legwork now to ensure members get on the same
page]{.underline} before NATO's June summit, if not sooner. [Achieving
consensus on significant cyber issues has previously taken
time.]{.underline} [NATO's attribution of the Microsoft Exchange hack
last summer]{.underline} to China was an important step for the alliance
and sent a strong signal to our adversaries. But it [took months to
reach agreement on the statement]{.underline}; the hack was uncovered in
March 2021 and the NATO statement was not made public until July[. In
the current crisis**, the alliance will not have the luxury of
waiting**]{.underline} four (or more) [months to agree on a response. To
avoid incurring **damaging costs to NATO's credibility and its deterrent
powers,** the allies should **refine their cyber policy,
now**]{.underline}.

### I/L -- AT Defense \[Attribution\]

#### Attribution is possible [now]{.underline} through using [past data]{.underline}, [attacker's mistakes]{.underline}, and [political context]{.underline}, but if anything, a joint OCO [bolsters]{.underline} it through freeing up available resources.

[The main **critique** of deterrence-by-punishment is that it is hard to
**attribute** cyberattacks]{.underline}. This reduces the credibility of
deterrence because it is too difficult to tell which systems to
retaliate against.122 Nevertheless, [though attribution is **costly**
and **time-consuming**]{.underline}, [it is
**possible**]{.underline}.123 On a technical level, [malware's source
code]{.underline} and programming style [can be **mapped** against
**previous incidents**]{.underline}.124 [In Iran]{.underline}, these
[forensics revealed similarities between **Stuxnet** and another
virus]{.underline} developed by the NSA called Flame, [intensifying
accusations against US involvement]{.underline} in both tools.125

Furthermore, [**anonymity** in cyberspace is **not** as **pervasive** as
critics make out]{.underline}, because [attackers do make
**mistakes**]{.underline}. For instance, the Chinese hacker group APT1
is recognisable for its sloppy re-use of social engineering tactics and
specific infrastructure.126 Additionally, [attribution is facilitated by
examining the **history and politics** surrounding an
attack]{.underline}; [in]{.underline} the case of
**[Stuxnet]{.underline}**, [the tense relations between
America]{.underline}, [Israel and Iran narrowed down the
list]{.underline} of likely sources.127 What's more, [Russia is
increasingly likely to use its **state** security **services** to
conduct attacks]{.underline}, [instead of]{.underline} more
**[anonymous]{.underline}** but [**lower skilled** non-state
hackers]{.underline}.128 This [suggests that attacks from NATO's main
adversary in cyberspace may become]{.underline} more
**[traceable]{.underline}**.

Most importantly, [a **joint** offensive cyber capability would benefit
NATO **precisely** because attribution is **time consuming** and
costly]{.underline}. [The quality of attribution is a function of
**available resources**]{.underline} -- [the more there
are]{.underline}, the [more accurately one can attribute an
attack]{.underline}.129 Although [pooling NATO's
capabilities]{.underline} would not increase the quantity of resources
available, it [would improve resource allocation and]{.underline} thus
[allow NATO to]{.underline} '[do more with the same']{.underline}.130 In
several countries, the growth of offensive cyber has already allowed for
greater specialisation in cyber operations. US Cyber Command
(USCYBERCOM) now has 133 teams, making it easier to dedicate teams to
specific tasks.131 [This division of labour]{.underline}, enabled by
pooling capabilities, [would]{.underline} hopefully [allow NATO to
devote **specialised** units to cyber forensics]{.underline}. This would
likely increase their output, [facilitating **timely and accurate**
attribution]{.underline}.

Much has been written about the fundamental changes in **[U.S. cyber
strategy]{.underline}**. U.S. Cyber Command's vision of "persistent
engagement" and the Department of Defense's new strategy [of "defend
forward"]{.underline} have, in particular, led to numerous critical
remarks about the risks of escalation between the U.S. and its main
adversaries in cyberspace.

These debates are worth continuing, including about what the change in
strategy means for establishing norms in cyberspace. But commentators
have so far ignored a key dimension: The strategy's main implications
may not reside in how it changes the dynamics between the U.S. and its
adversaries but, instead, in how it **[affects broader alliance
relationships]{.underline}**, especially beyond the Five Eyes
(Australia, Canada, the U.K., the U.S. and New Zealand). [U.S. Cyber
Command's mission to cause friction in adversaries']{.underline} freedom
of maneuver in [cyberspace may end up **causing significant friction in
allies' trust** and confidence]{.underline}---[and **adversaries may be
able to exploit that**]{.underline}.

Operating "Seamlessly, Globally, and Continuously"

[Cyber Command's]{.underline} new [strategy seeks to
operate]{.underline} "[seamlessly]{.underline}, [globally]{.underline},
[and continuously]{.underline}." It states that "\[s\]uperiority through
persistence seizes and maintains the initiative in cyberspace by
continuously engaging and contesting adversaries and causing them
uncertainty wherever they maneuver." According to the strategy document,
Cyber Command intends to do this "as close as possible to adversaries
and their operations," connecting persistent engagement to the
Pentagon's principle of "defending forward."

In an article for Joint Force Quarterly (JFQ), NSA Director and Cyber
Command head Gen. Paul Nakasone writes: "We must instead maneuver
seamlessly across the interconnected battlespace, globally, as close as
possible to adversaries and their operations, and continuously shape the
battlespace to create operational advantage for us while denying the
same to our adversaries."

[When Nakasone says the U.S. must get]{.underline} "**[as close as
possible to adversaries]{.underline}** and their operations," [he
implies that the U.S. seeks to achieve effects that are **outside** of
**its own networks**]{.underline} and beyond the networks of its
adversaries. This vast area is not ungoverned space. It includes, for
example, routers in Nairobi, servers in Denmark or operating
infrastructure in any other country around the world.

Blue Space, Gray Space and Red Space

In the JFQ article, Nakasone also states that "if we are only defending
in 'blue space' we have failed." This use of terminology as well as talk
about "operating close to the adversary" evades one issue: It is unclear
whether Cyber Command only seeks to cause friction in "red space" or if
it seeks to compete in "gray space" as well. These terms are often
confused and not well-understood. (The terms "gray zone"---areas where
it's unclear whether the government has legal authority to act---and
"gray space" are also frequently confused.) In fact, the issue was
raised for "further exploration" at Cyber Command's 2018 symposium,
specifically understanding the "relevance of concepts like area of
responsibility and red-blue-gray space to the cyberspace domain."

Joint Publication 3-12 (JP 3-12) on cyberspace operations, prepared
under the direction of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
explains the terminology:

The term "blue cyberspace" denotes areas in cyberspace protected by the
US, its mission partners, and other areas DOD may be ordered to protect.
Although DOD has standing orders to protect only the Department of
Defense information network (DODIN), cyberspace forces prepare on order,
and when requested by other authorities, to defend or secure other
United States Government (USG) or other cyberspace, as well as
cyberspace related to critical infrastructure and key resources (CI/KR)
of the US and PNs \[partner nations\]. The term "red cyberspace" refers
to those portions of cyberspace owned or controlled by an adversary or
enemy. In this case, "controlled" means more than simply "having a
presence on," since threats may have clandestine access to elements of
global cyberspace where their presence is undetected and without
apparent impact to the operation of the system. Here, controlled means
the ability to direct the operations of a link or node of cyberspace, to
the exclusion of others. All cyberspace that does not meet the
description of either "blue" or "red" is referred to as "gray"
cyberspace.

Gray space is defined based on the nodes adversaries control. This means
the vast area between U.S. government-owned networks and adversaries is
not considered to be gray space. Instead, if for instance the GRU
(Russia's military intelligence agency) controls a node in the
Netherlands, it is considered to be red space based on JP 3-12. And it's
worth mentioning that the notion of control is open to interpretation by
states.

This means that if Cyber Command seeks to operate only in "red space,"
its activities will still have global reach (globally). It also suggests
that red space grows as adversaries expand their operational activity.
Most importantly, this implies that if Cyber Command seeks to achieve
"effects" in gray space, this will involve operating infrastructure that
adversaries do not control---which is to say those systems or networks
on which adversaries merely have a presence or are not active at all.

What's New Under the Sun?

What's really new here? The United States has long operated in networks
"close to the adversary." As Ben Buchanan's book, "The Cybersecurity
Dilemma," demonstrates, the U.S. has long acted as an "observer" in gray
space, gathering intelligence of adversarial activity in those others'
networks. In fact, information has become public concerning a case in
which the Five Eyes collected intelligence about an espionage platform
(dubbed "Snowglobe" by the Canadian Intelligence Agency CSEC and "Animal
Farm" by Kaspersky Lab) of an allied country, France, likely operating
in adversarial networks in the Middle East. In other words, the practice
of fourth-party collection is nothing new. And the U.S. has also long
acted in foreign nonadversarial networks as a "passerby," transiting
through gray space networks to access an adversarial network.

But the new Cyber Command and Defense Department strategy changes the
nature of the U.S. military's behavior within those systems and
networks. Under the new strategy, Cyber Command wants to be an active
disrupter on those networks. It wants to achieve effects.

The only known precedent is Cyber Command operators wiping Islamic State
propaganda material off a server located in Germany. The German
government was notified in some fashion but not asked for advance
consent, causing much frustration.

This will likely lead to a systematic scaling up: Cyber Command now also
seeks to be an active disrupter on those networks "globally,
continuously and seamlessly"---not regionally and sporadically.

The [Danger of Operating Seamlessly in Allied Networks]{.underline}

Operating instantly makes sense considering the potential operational
tempo of adversaries: You can't have protracted diplomatic discussions
for two months with an ally about whether or not to take down some
command and control infrastructure of an adversary hosted in the allied
country. You don't have days, let alone months. As a participant
mentioned at the recent Chatham House Rule 2019 Cyber Command Symposium
on strategy: "Opportunities within this domain are fleeting."

Operating seamlessly could also make sense if an ally does not mind the
U.S. coming into its networks to address the malicious activity. In this
vein, the U.S. can continue to build partnerships with countries that do
not have the capacity to defend against cyber attacks on their own.

But, **[what if an allied country is not keen on having the U.S.
military in its networks]{.underline}**, [actively]{.underline},
[seamlessly]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [continuously]{.underline}
[disrupting an adversary's cyber operations?]{.underline} As the German
case shows, this [scenario **will** likely **come up** a lot **more in
the** near **future**.]{.underline}

In other words, [in seeking to]{.underline} successfully [create
friction in cyberspace for adversaries]{.underline}, [Cyber
Com]{.underline}mand [may]{.underline} also [seek to act within allied
networks]{.underline}, [even if the ally does not approve]{.underline}.
[It might]{.underline} even [be successful]{.underline} in its mission,
causing friction in adversaries' operations before they cause serious
harm to the U.S. [But this strategy runs a real risk of **undermining
allies' trust**]{.underline} and confidence in ways that are subtle and
not easily observable. This ought not to be overlooked, especially since
[**this element** may itself **be exploited by
adversaries**]{.underline}.

Adversaries don't randomly choose which intermediate nodes to direct
their operations through. [If **Russia** has the choice to go through a
network that would raise some serious diplomatic friction between the
U.S. and a U.S. ally]{.underline}, [or operate through a network that
would cause no]{.underline} diplomatic [friction]{.underline} for the
U.S., [what would it prefer?]{.underline} [It **would** make sense for
adversaries to **operate through the networks** of exactly those
countries **with which the U.S. has a strong relationship**]{.underline}
but that do not want the U.S. to operate within their networks causing
any effects.

[**Russia is already good at exploiting divisions** between the U.S. and
its allies]{.underline}. [Cyber Command's new strategy might give it
**another avenue**]{.underline} to do so.

### I/L -- AT OCOs Bad 

#### Individual OCOs are bad--but a joint capability would increase NATO ability to control retaliation.

//AN

[[A]{.underline}]{.mark} third [[**criticism** is that retaliatory
cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark} can easily cause collateral damage and
[[are]{.mark} dangerously **[escalatory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since
the distinction between internal and external networks is often blurred,
attacks directed at a defender's network may spill over into external
networks.138 Adopting a persistent engagement approach will also pose
increasing risks for escalation.139 This is aggravated by the absence of
international agreements determining unacceptable behaviour in
cyberspace.140 This dissertation does not dispute [[these]{.mark}
criticisms]{.underline}; on the contrary, they [[**strengthen** the case
for a **joint-NATO**]{.mark} **offensive cyber
[capability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is
[[because]{.underline}]{.mark} one of [the main
**solutions**]{.underline} to these problems [is **increased control**
of cyber operations]{.underline}.141 **[A joint capability [would
increase NATO members' control]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [because [it
would facilitate **agreement** on how to integrate]{.mark} offensive
cyber [effects into a]{.mark} Flexible Deterrent Options]{.underline}
(**[[FDO]{.underline}]{.mark}**) package.142 [FDOs are meant [to allow
for a **gradual** increase of **pressure** in response to
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[limiting]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
chance of **[[uncontrolled escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.143 Chapter
5 outlines how offensive cyber could be integrated into an FDO package
in more detail. [[Leaving members to adhere to their **own FDOs**
undermines the **unity** of NATO's response to an
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, the extra control that
centralised C2 offers would allow NATO to reduce the risk of
cyberattacks causing collateral damage.144 Though this risk cannot be
eliminated entirely, [joint C2]{.underline} and standardised offensive
cyber doctrine [could add extra controls that seem **unlikely** to
appear **at the CyOC**]{.underline}. For instance, doctrine could
dictate that large attacks should only be launched against military
networks; air defence systems are unlikely to be on the same network as
hospitals, mitigating the chance of collateral damage.

### I/L - Deterrence

#### A joint OCO unlocks cyber-deterrence:

#### 1. It upskills all NATO members with cyber-intelligence and expertise[.]{.underline} 

**University of Exeter** **20**. "Should NATO Adopt a Joint Offensive
Cyber Capability?" September 2020.
<https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/strategyandsecurityinstitute/pdfs/mstrat/James_Prideaux.pdf>.
//AN

First, NATO's cyber-deterrence would be more credible because [a
[**joint cyber capability** would facilitate **knowledge
transfer**]{.mark} between member states]{.underline}. [For
**deterrence** to be successful]{.underline}, [[NATO has to convince
aggressors that it can retaliate]{.mark} against the right aggressor in
a manner [that imposes **unacceptable
costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [However]{.underline}, state and
non-state [[actors]{.underline}]{.mark}, like the Fancy Bear
cyber-espionage group likely [associated with]{.underline} the
[Russian]{.underline} security [services]{.underline}, [[know]{.mark}
that [the **disaggregation** of]{.mark} member [states' cyber assets
makes this hard]{.mark}er to achieve]{.underline}.89 The primary reason
for this separation of effort is that intelligence on adversaries' cyber
vulnerabilities is closely guarded by national intelligence agencies.90
This intelligence is absolutely critical for effective cyber
attac[ks]{.underline}, since it is necessary to understand the targeted
systems in great detail.91 [The [CyOC will not go **far enough** in
fostering intel]{.mark}ligence sharing]{.underline}, even though it aims
to 'integrate cyber capabilities into NATO planning and operations'.92
It is certainly a step forward, but of those states that have offered
their cyber effects to NATO, [France and **America** have]{.underline}
clearly [stated they will retain **full control** of their
operations]{.underline} and capabilities.93 [This **lack** of joint
operational authority poses a]{.underline} significant
**[challenge]{.underline}**, as it appears the centre will serve to
coordinate rather than oversee operations.94 [It]{.underline} will prove
very hard to achieve even this when [members' [capabilities **vary
greatly**]{.mark} in their maturity and development]{.underline}.
Whereas Germany is said to have thousands of 'information and cyber
officers', other European states have hardly any.95 Overall,
[[NATO]{.mark} in its current state [is **not optimised** for
deterrence-by-punishment]{.mark} and the CyOC will do little to improve
this]{.underline}.

[Instead]{.underline}, [[pooling members' cyber-intel]{.mark}ligence and
cyber-sabotage expertise [would encourage **intra-alliance** knowledge
transfer]{.mark}]{.underline}. Knowledge transfer in organisations is
the process through which one unit, like a department or division, is
affected by the experience of another.96 Empirical evidence suggests
that [**interconnected** organisations]{.underline} like franchises and
chains [hold **comparative** advantages over their **autonomous**
counterparts]{.underline}, due to the ability to transfer knowledge
between their constituent elements.97

[This would apply to **NATO**]{.underline} in two ways.
[First]{.underline}, organisational [**integration** of
cyber-intelligence]{.underline} would facilitate knowledge transfer, as
demonstrated by the preparations behind Stuxnet.98 To design such a
complex computer worm, the US National Security Agency (NSA)
collaborated with Israel's counterpart, Unit 8200, largely because it
had deep intelligence about operations at Iran's Natanz facility.99 This
was vital for the attack's success, because the individual control
systems they targeted had unique configurations, making them harder to
penetrate.100

[Second]{.underline}, [**merging** cyber-sabotage
capabilities]{.underline} would similarly aid knowledge transfer. There
are two types of knowledge required for cyber-sabotage operations. One
type is explicit and can be transferred in a systematic manner, such as
knowledge of how a SCADA system works or how to write code in a certain
programming language.101 The other, more significant type is tacit
knowledge, which is difficult to transfer to another person by
verbalising or writing it down.102 This could include a hacker's
accumulated experience or knowledge of a cyber command's implicit
operational processes.103 Tacit knowledge can be shared, but this is
done by performance and learning by example.104 A joint offensive cyber
capability would provide an excellent opportunity for this to happen.105
[Both forms of knowledge transfer would be]{.underline} especially
[[useful for '**upskilling'**]{.underline}]{.mark} those [NATO [members
that **lack** the]{.mark} advanced technical [**expertise** in
America]{.mark}]{.underline}, Britain, France and Germany. In practice,
[[this would make]{.mark} acquiring [cyberattack]{.mark} tools and
training personnel **[easier and cheaper]{.mark}**]{.underline}.106 The
importance of training technical personnel should not be underestimated,
because all members are short of them but most lack the resources to
attract them.107 Pooling capabilities is one way of alleviating this
pressure. In turn, the cumulative benefits of knowledge transfer [would
likely make it easier to launch **retaliatory** attacks against
the]{.underline} right [aggressor and impose **unacceptable**
costs]{.underline} more successfully. Overall, [[this would
improve]{.underline}]{.mark} the credibility of a
[**[deterrence]{.underline}**-]{.mark}by- punishment posture.

#### 2. It [improves]{.underline} attack coordination.

**University of Exeter** **20**. "Should NATO Adopt a Joint Offensive
Cyber Capability?" September 2020.
<https://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/strategyandsecurityinstitute/pdfs/mstrat/James_Prideaux.pdf>.
//AN

Furthermore, [a **joint** capability]{.underline} [would improve NATO's
**offensive** cyber C2,]{.underline} [improving attack **coordination**
and mitigating **fratricide**]{.underline}. This is because NATO's
'volunteer' system and its CyOC mark a striking departure from the way
it usually handles C2of members' assets.108 The NATO Force Structure
dictates that conventional forces like ships and tanks come under the
full operational control of an assigned NATO commander.109 However,
according to a retired USAF Colonel leading the implementation of NATO's
2017 cyber policy, the C2 problems inherent in the volunteer system make
it 'far from ideal'.110 This is because [NATO commanders do not know the
details of capabilities available to them]{.underline}, [such as their
legal consequences]{.underline}, [**impeding** the decision-making
process]{.underline}.111 [Commanders]{.underline} also [want to know how
using cyberweapons might **conflict** with other
operations]{.underline}; [without this they are left **'flying
blind'**]{.underline}.112 [Failing to **coordinate** operations can have
**far-reaching** consequences]{.underline}. For instance, intelligence
agencies' [reconnaissance of target networks needs to be coordinated
with cyber-sabotage operations]{.underline}, [so they do not
**interfere**]{.underline} with each other.113
**[Disaggregated]{.underline}** [C2 can]{.underline} even [result in
**fratricide**]{.underline} [on other allies' networks]{.underline},
[because the distinction between internal and external security threats
is]{.underline} much [harder to **ascertain**]{.underline} [in
cyberspace]{.underline} than in the other four domains.114 The CyOC is a
step towards resolving this, but **[until a NATO commander has control
over members' capabilities]{.underline}**, [these **problems will not be
fully resolved**]{.underline}.

#### 3. It [streamlines]{.underline} decision-making.

**University of Exeter** **20**. "Should NATO Adopt a Joint Offensive
Cyber Capability?" September 2020.

//AN

Additionally, [a **unified** offensive cyber]{.underline} C2
[structure]{.underline} [would aid scenario planning]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [speed up decision-making]{.underline}. This is
important, because [NATO needs to **streamline** its]{.underline}
current decision-making [process]{.underline} in the cyber domain.115 [A
**single** command would help members agree on
**appropriate**]{.underline} forms of [retaliation]{.underline} in
cyberspace in different scenarios, **[bolstering]{.underline}** the
credibility of **[deterrence]{.underline}**-by-punishment even further.
[Without a **clear** command structure]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline}
very [**difficult** for the 30 NATO allies]{.underline} -- [who have
**different** threat perceptions and suffer from a **lack** of
**cohesion**]{.underline} -- [to agree on effective
response]{.underline} scenarios in contingency planning.116 [As a case
in point]{.underline}, [**Estonia** is willing to strike back when
attacked online]{.underline}, given its memory of the 2007 attack and
its proximity to Russia.117 [However]{.underline}, Estonian officials
[do not know whether other allies will support them]{.underline},
validating some scholars' arguments that [NATO needs to find **common
ground** in cyber contingency planning]{.underline}.118 [The **secrecy**
that shrouds allies' capabilities and the **uncertainty**
surrounding]{.underline} cyber scenario [planning]{.underline} might
[explain why offensive cyber effects **do not feature** in
NATO]{.underline}'[s]{.underline} mission planning
[process]{.underline}.119 [This is not to say that NATO needs
to]{.underline} publicly [agree on a **'red line'** in cyberspace that
could trigger]{.underline} an [**A**rticle **5**]{.underline} response.
[If anything]{.underline}, NATO's current **[strategic
ambiguity]{.underline}** [is **key** for deterring attacks]{.underline}
that fall just below a defined threshold.120 However, [unifying cyber C2
would help them carry out scenario planning behind closed
doors]{.underline}, [improving the Alliance's
**readiness**]{.underline}. [Speeding up the decision-making process is
**crucial**]{.underline} [given how long it can take to **attribute**
and then **launch** a retaliatory attack]{.underline}.121 Overall,
streamlined scenario planning and decision- making, augmented by
improved coordination of cyberattacks, would strengthen the credibility
of deterrence-by-punishment. [Although aggressors]{.underline} like

crossed]{.underline}, [it would **tilt** their risk-benefit **calculus**

//AN

The [benefits of a **joint** offensive cyber capability for
**conventional** collective defence]{.underline} are far easier to
discern than cyber-deterrence. [NATO could use it for tactical
operations to **support** combat operations and **shape** the
battlefield.]{.underline}149 [The most obvious scenario this could be
used in is if NATO were **attacked** by Russia]{.underline}, [the only
state whose conventional forces pose a **threat**]{.underline}.
[Offensive cyber capabilities would be an important force **multiplier**
in the event of a Russian attack]{.underline} on the Baltic states,
[where local force ratios would favour the attacker.]{.underline}150
Battlefield [NATO commanders could use cyber effects to **disrupt**
Russian C2 networks or the software on advanced weapons]{.underline},
like surface-to-air missiles or fighter aircraft.151 Anti-access/ area
denial operations ([A2/AD]{.underline}) [like these seek to **deny**
attackers the ability to bring their assets into a **contested**
region]{.underline} and prevent them from operating freely within it.152
Offensive cyber capabilities have already been used in this way to great
effect. In 2007, the Israeli Air Force allegedly used the Suter computer
program to conduct an airstrike against a nuclear reactor in Northern
Syria.153 This fed Syria's air defence systems a false-sky picture,
allowing Israeli fighter jets to successfully bomb the reactor without
being detected.154 In many ways, cyber effects will become a basic
necessity in conventional warfare. No modern air force would enter
combat without electronic warfare (EW) capabilities; [as cyber and EW
**merge** into a **single** activity]{.underline}, [air operations will
require **cyber** support]{.underline}.155 Overall, [since cyberweapons
can be so **effective** on the battlefield]{.underline}, [they would
clearly aid NATO's **warfighting** ability]{.underline}.

[A joint capability would be the **best way** to fulfill this
role]{.underline}. [The CyOC is hoping to **coordinate** battlefield
effects in a similar way]{.underline}.156 [However]{.underline}, [the
**secrecy** of members' capabilities and the **persistence** of
sovereign operational authority will make it harder]{.underline} for
SACEUR [to quickly decide whether and how to use
cyberweapons]{.underline}. [This would be **detrimental** in a **hot
war** scenario]{.underline}, [the rapid pace of which demands decisions
to be made]{.underline} '[at the **speed** of
relevance']{.underline}.157 Additionally, [offensive cyberweapons depend
heavily on force **integration** to be effective on the
battlefield]{.underline}.158 [**The greater the integration between
conventional and cyber operations, the greater the multiplier** effect
achieved]{.underline} -- [as proved by Israel's highly coordinated
airstrike]{.underline}.159 [However]{.underline}, it seems [**the
current volunteer system is lacking** in this regard]{.underline}. A
senior NATO official has acknowledged the Alliance needs to get better
at aligning its cyber assets with its Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) in
the Baltics as part of an A2/AD strategy.160 This means it needs to
improve coordination with the EFP's graduated response plans and
practise battlefield cyberattacks in a more realistic way during
exercises.161 To this end, [the improved C2]{.underline}, [knowledge
transfer]{.underline} and [resource allocation]{.underline} [that a
joint cyber capability offers would augment not just cyber-deterrence
but **collective defence** too]{.underline}.

### I/L -- Cohesion Key

#### NATO cohesion key to development of technologies and mitigating future cyber risks

C[. **Strengthening Trust and Interoperability** Across the Alliance The
coming decade will be of pivotal importance to NATO]{.underline} as a
period characterised by a continuously evolving technology landscape
with potentially disruptive effects [in the cyber domain]{.underline}
and beyond. [In an era of uncertainty, constrained resources and
political tension, cooperation and trust will be fundamental enablers of
an agile, technology-driven and digital NATO]{.underline}. [Only through
joint efforts will NATO truly be able to harness the potential of the
emerging technologies]{.underline} discussed in this chapter [and
successfully mitigate the risks and threats they may pose in the future.
The **need for trust therefore extends to both trust in technology and
trust in the Alliance and its member states.**]{.underline}

Similar to how the effects of emerging technologies should not be
treated in isolation, [**NATO's response** to emerging technologies
**must be one of joint efforts and interoperability**.]{.underline}
Technical, legal, financial and organisational [barriers to the
implementation of emerging technologies are more likely to be overcome
through joint capability and force development efforts, which will, by
extension, also help build trust and facilitate
interoperability]{.underline}. Several of the emerging technology areas
discussed in this paper would place significant data, infrastructure and
interoperability requirements on NATO, which may be particularly
difficult to overcome given the current state of data heterogeneity and
sometimes incompatible digital infrastructure across the Alliance.
[Several emerging technologies would also require interoperability in
relation to shared vocabularies of technical terms, norms, standards and
organisational practices]{.underline}, as well as human interoperability
and joint training and exercising. For example, AI has been highlighted
as a potential area of concern where a lack of interoperability and
common definitions paired with technological mismatches could erode
Alliance cohesion (Dufour, 2018).

[Joint efforts are, therefore, likely to help overcome these
challenges]{.underline} and barriers to NATO harnessing emerging
technologies in the next decade. While the 30-member Alliance may be at
a competitive disadvantage compared to single state or non-state
adversaries in relation to interoperability barriers, [NATO's
**collective strength** may also serve as an enabler for technological
superiority.]{.underline} Joint planning, requirement setting, and
development may enable individual member states to pursue specialisation
in aspects of particular emergent technology areas, thereby allowing
other countries to pursue other specialisations and, by extension,
[**increasing the overall capability within the Alliance**.]{.underline}

#### Alliance cohesion over cybersecurity key to prevent exploitation of internal disagreements

**Author?? 21** (author, "The V4 towards a new NATO Strategic Concept
and the EU Strategic Compass," 2021,
https://www.europeum.org/data/articles/the-v4-towards-a-new-nato-strategic-concept.pdf)-lh

This issue, over which there are no major disagreements among V4 states,
comprises [cybersecurity and the development of the alliance's
resilience in cyberspace. All member states agree that this new
operational domain has become vital in all types of conflicts, and
therefore must be a **key area of cooperation amongst NATO**
members]{.underline}. Our experts also noted that [cyber resilience is
an area where cohesion can be achieved at the lowest cost]{.underline}.
This does not diminish the importance of the topic at hand; rather, it
shows us that there are still key challenges which have to be overcome
in the near future. Despite the fact that it is not a physical area of
operations, [cyberspace cannot be separated from the aforementioned
geopolitical tensions. It is also connected with the question of the
alliance's stance towards **Russia and China**; both of these countries
have robust capabilities in cyberspace, which they are keen to utilise
in the developing **great power competition**.]{.underline} This factor
is also relevant on a lower level, [connected to other **disruptive and
hostile powers such as Iran or North Korea**, as well as non-state
actors such as international terrorist organisations.]{.underline} The
V4 countries naturally have lower levels of readiness in cyberspace than
the great powers do; however, it is entirely possible for small and
medium-sized powers to enhance their resilience against cyberattacks.
For example, Estonia reacted (with the support of NATO) to Russian cyber
aggression, and developed robust defensive infrastructure and practices,
which should be emulated by other countries.

Due to its limited size, resources, demography, and industrial capacity,
Estonia could not aspire to such a power position in terms of
conventional warfare. International cooperation in cyber resilience is
also a force multiplier, and no country can or should rely solely on
itself. [Thus, it is in the interests of security and political
stability to have more pronounced cooperation in this
field.]{.underline} The V4 can be a champion in this area: Poland is a
great example of the rapid development of the cyber industry, deeply
anchored in the transatlantic alliance.

The security environment in the 21st century is fundamentally different
to any time in the past. The geopolitics of today is not about the
possession of territory and material resources, but about the
interdependence of economies and companies, as well as the incorporation
of new technologies, such as 5G networks and AI, often developed either
in the US or China. In such an environment, [NATO should incorporate
defence capabilities into the fields of cyberspace]{.underline},
countering fake news, human trafficking, and weaponising migration. NATO
must be prepared for future challenges; however, this is a much harder
task to accomplish in the V4 region than it is in Western Europe. This
can and should be seen as an opportunity. While the V4 countries have
neither the population bases nor the resources to compete with global
leading players, the knowledge-based economies of tomorrow create a
solid chance even for small and medium-sized states to catch up with
wealthier and bigger states.

1.1.6. Resilience In order to tackle these challenges, [NATO members
have to be resilient]{.underline}, but there is also a need for a
terminological debate on the merits and meaning of resilience. We need
to differentiate between the classical understanding of resilience as
civil preparedness relating to crisis response and management;
democratic resilience relating to institutions, values and commitments;
and cyber resilience. While cyber resilience and civil preparedness are
low-hanging fruits from a cooperation perspective, democratic resilience
will be a subject of heated political discussion.

In the coming years, NATO will begin to see more and more so-called
"homeland deployments". These will be mainly in response to climate
change and caused by extreme weather events such as floods, wildfires
and heavy storms. With the increasing intensity of such events, civilian
agencies responsible for crisis response and management will not have
sufficient capabilities, leading to the need for deployment of armed
forces. On a mass scale, we witnessed such a scenario in 2020, where
armed forces were deployed to support the countering of the COVID-19
pandemic. Central topics in Alliance discussions on how to adapt to
these coming challenges should include enhancing the interoperability of
armed forces with civilian agencies in crisis situations, reviewing the
adequacy of national legal frameworks, and refocusing CIMIC efforts from
peacebuilding missions abroad to "home front" deployments. Of course,
all this is directly connected to the need for enhanced resilience
building and civil preparedness.

The NATO 2030 report by the Secretary General outlined some necessary
reforms in terms of political decision-making processes; it suggested
changes to the fundamental underpinnings of NATO and, therefore,
alliance cohesion itself. The report, written among others by Wess
Mitchell, is a thought-provoking document. However, it is highly
unlikely that the decision-making process will truly undergo a
fundamental procedural change, nor is it clearly in the Alliance's
interest to reform this aspect. NATO's current decision-making process
reflects decades of tradition and political will. It maintains and
underpins internal cohesion, to the benefit of all NATO allies. The V4
countries share the positive sentiment that the current consensus-based
process is within the group's best interest. Leaving
consensusdecision-making behind in any area promotes [a perception of
decreased cohesion to our adversaries and a potential angle where
**internal disagreements might be exploited to undermine the alliance.**
This is a risk factor that all NATO allies]{.underline} -- particularly
the V4 member states, which are reliant on NATO's traditional threat
response capabilities -- [want to avoid.]{.underline}

#### Cohesion over cyber norm-development reduces risk of cyberattack escalation

**Davis 19** (Susan Davis, "NATO IN THE CYBER AGE: STRENGTHENING
SECURITY & DEFENCE, STABILISING DETERRENCE," NATO Parliamentary
Assembly, 8/13/2019,
https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=sites/default/files/2019-09/148%20STC%20Davis%20-%20NATO%20IN%20THE%20CYBER%20AGE%20-%20fall%20revision%20-%20clean%2011.9.19.pdf)-lh

Policy circles within the Alliance and beyond continue to debate [how
cyber attacks affect stability during crises and armed
conflict.]{.underline} Which types of cyber attacks would be
de-escalatory, escalatory, or neutral? Would the answer differ depending
on when, during a crisis or an armed conflict, they would be launched?
And are there significant differences between various states on these
answers? States most likely do not see a cyber attack as a viable option
for a pre-emptive first strike. However, [in a crisis or pre-war
situation, they could perceive a significant **"cost of going
second"**]{.underline} (Davis, 2014). In such situations, [one side "may
well be frightened of what would happen if the other side attacks and
may be convinced that going first will be advantageous"]{.underline}
(Davis, 2014). [This could lead to **high escalatory risks** in a
crisis. Another key problem is the difficulty of determining the intent
of a cyber intrusion (Lindsay, 2015). When a defender detects a breach,
he may not know whether the intruder wants to spy on him, conduct
forward defence, gain a foothold for future defensive measures, or
prepare for an imminent or future cyber attack (]{.underline}Slayton,
2017). It is extremely difficult to gauge intent in cyber space, and, in
such cases, [**states tend to assume the worst** (Hennessey, 2017). As a
result, this can lead to misperception and an escalatory spiral
(Slayton, 2017]{.underline}). In sum, escalation dynamics deserve
considerably more attention. For now, however[, the Alliance should seek
to reduce escalatory risks through clear diplomatic messaging and
engagement; **a high level of transparency on cyber
policies**;]{.underline} examining escalation dynamics in exercises; [as
well as **support to norm-development and confidence building
measures**.]{.underline}

III\. NATO CYBER POLICY 23. At the political level, the Alliance
continues to adapt its cyber security, defence, and deterrence policies
through regularly updated action plans with concrete objectives and
timelines. This section outlines NATO's: - overarching strategies to
counter cyber attacks; - cyber capability development; - the integration
of cyber capabilities into NATO planning; - concrete cooperation in
NATO; and - NATO's cyber partnerships.

A. NATO'S OVERALL CYBER STRATEGY 24. As armed forces around the world,
including in potential adversary states, build up their cyber
capabilities, [NATO and its member states must devise strategies and
policies to counter the threat of serious state-directed cyber
attacks.]{.underline} Overall, [NATO is leaning heavily on the same
general strategies it uses to counter other attacks: dissuasion by
denial and deterrence by punishment. However, **Allies should continue
to support work on international norms**]{.underline} and engage in
serious discussions if and how strategies such as persistent engagement,
as outlined above, can [supplement overall NATO strategy.]{.underline}

1\. Norms in Cyber Space 25. [Due to the specific characteristics of
malicious cyber code, arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation
measures]{.underline} very [likely remain beyond reach for
now]{.underline}, most importantly because verification seems
impossible. [However, the further development of **norms in cyber space
could become an important pillar of support** against such attacks. NATO
continues to argue that international law applies to cyber
space,]{.underline} including international humanitarian law and the
United Nations Charter. This is also in line with the declaration of the
2013 Report of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on
Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the
Context of International Security (UN GGE, 2013). The Alliance has
declared its [support for "work on voluntary international norms of
responsible state behaviour and confidence-building measures regarding
cyberspace]{.underline}" (NATO, 2016b). [Allies furthermore made clear
that **they "stand to benefit from a norms-based, predictable, and
secure cyberspace**"]{.underline} (NATO, 2018a). However, it is
unrealistic to expect that NATO, as an Alliance of 29 sovereign nations,
could become the primary driving force for the further development of
norms. Instead, individual [Allies must continue to drive this effort in
the international community and encourage other member states to do the
same.]{.underline}

**US NATO cohesion key to deterring cyber attacks**

This thesis uses a case study analysis to better understand the effects
of Russian cyber operations. This approach is best to grasp how the
[cyber operations have become more effective and efficient over
time]{.underline}. This has enabled Russia to conduct operations of
similar ends against multiple states in order to further its own
objectives. Russia views NATO expansion as a direct threat to Russia and
reasoning behind this will be analyzed to discover where it fits into
Russian grand strategy. [[**Lack of political cohesion** within the NATO
Alliance **creates a vulnerability for Russia to
exploit.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Political instability and distrust in
the government can be analyzed through the 2016 presidential election,
as well as the election tampering in Europe, because both are important
case studies to showcase how Russia has adapted the use of cyber and
technology to further the effectiveness of its activities. [**[Civil
preparedness and resiliency are key]{.mark}** parts of NATO strength
that Russia has attempted to exploit to diminish NATO's capacity to
respond during a crisis.]{.underline} Dragonfly and NotPetya displayed
the progression of Russian cyber capabilities against critical
infrastructure in a short period of time. The effectiveness and concerns
highlighted by these cases are important to analyze in order for NATO
states to better prepare to defend against cyber operations of this
type. [The disruption and [damage that can be caused through **critical
infrastructure attacks has a global impac**t]{.mark} that far exceeds
that of the United States and NATO.]{.underline}

#### **Lack of cohesion on cyber spills over -- emboldens adversaries** 

**Kramer 20** -- Franklin Kramer is a member of the board at the
Atlantic Council and the Former Assistant Secretary of Defense for

cyberspace". Published December 9, 2020.

//DG

President-Elect Joe Biden's transition team has declared cyber threats
as "one of the defining challenges of our time." In its early days, the
incoming US administration must take on cybersecurity threats as one of
its key priorities. Nowhere will that effort be more important than with
the United States' closest Allies at NATO, a cornerstone for Western
security. Today, NATO's security is threatened by Russia's and China's
continuous cyberattacks on the Alliance and its members. To accomplish
its mission of deterrence and defense, NATO needs to implement a
strategy of proactive, continuous responses to China and Russia in
cyberspace, where great power competition is playing out in real time.

**[Russia and China challenge NATO and its members in cyberspace on a
daily basis]{.underline}**, as part of ongoing hybrid campaigns to
undermine the transatlantic community. The Kremlin's actions have
involved intrusions into Allies' critical infrastructures, manipulating
Allies' elections through hacks and disinformation, and even blocking
GPS information critical to NATO activities. The Chinese government has
engaged in cyber espionage against Allies' military capabilities;
intellectual property theft related to sensitive technologies,
industries, and infrastructure; and disinformation against transatlantic
countries, including around the coronavirus. **[These efforts to weaken
NATO countries and Alliance cohesion represent a persistent threat to
Allied security]{.underline}**.

NATO has recognized the collective dangers of these hybrid attacks in
cyberspace. Up to this point, however, the Alliance has taken a reactive
approach, responding as if Russian and Chinese cyber attacks are each
isolated incidents. But because Russian and Chinese cyber efforts are
part of continuous campaigns directed at the overall capability of the
Alliance, NATO's response has been insufficient, failing to reduce or
dissuade further attacks. To assure the security of its members going
forward, **[NATO needs its own continuous response campaign to these
threats.]{.underline}**

President-elect Biden and his team have pledged to renew US leadership
in cooperation with Allies and partners. That agenda should start at
NATO, and a key focus should be on cybersecurity. In early NATO
meetings, the Biden administration should champion a cybersecurity
continuous-response campaign, built around three key actions.

First, NATO should require the development and implementation of
resilient cybersecurity architectures for itself, its members' forces,
and its key critical infrastructures. **[A resilient cybersecurity
architecture involves an integrated set of capabilities that work as a
system to reduce the disruptive effects of adversaries]{.underline}** in
cyber. Key elements of a resilient architecture should include use of
private sector cloud technology; zero-trust architecture for effective
access management; development of secure hardware capabilities; and
machine-learning and artificial-intelligence-augmented cyber defenses.
This architecture also needs to be flexible to incorporate emerging
technologies as they are developed.

NATO itself cannot develop such architectures. It can, however,
underscore their necessity and require its members to do so, using the
NATO Defense Planning Process (NDPP), acquisition procedures, standards
and targets, and innovation from Allied Command Transformation to
support a comprehensive research and development effort. In establishing
requirements for these resilient architectures, NATO must recognize that
one size will not fit all. Not only will requirements differ among
military, government, and critical infrastructures operators, but, as
has been shown in the development of autonomous vehicles and space
capabilities, there are a variety of different approaches that may prove
effective. In fact, having diversity within these capabilities will
increase resilience by complicating adversaries' abilities to infiltrate
and attack them.

Second, NATO, in coordination with its nations, should undertake active
cyber defense. Even the best exclusionary capabilities in a
cybersecurity resilient architecture can fail due to technical loopholes
or human error. As a result, the Alliance needs "active cyber defenses"
that can create resilience even when an attacker has breached cyber
protections. These capabilities affect only those networks in which
operators and owners have installed them and are not for offensive
purposes. As the US National Security Agency explains, key elements of
active defense capacities include "real-time communications,...sensors
that report data on the current state of the network, sense-making
analytics to understand the current state, automated decision-making to
decide how to react to current state information, and capabilities to
act on those decisions to defend the network." NATO should include such
active defense capabilities as a requirement of an overall resilient
cybersecurity architecture.

As a key element of active cyber defense, NATO must be capable of
hunting for adversaries within cyber systems critical to defense. The
Alliance should develop highly capable expert hunt teams to review
system activities, detect anomalies, and defeat intruders, for example
by deleting malware and closing unnecessary ports. NATO can
significantly enhance Allies' active defense efforts by establishing an
NDPP requirement for national cybersecurity hunt teams, along with
command arrangements for those teams in both hybrid and Article 5
contingencies. It should also establish several NATO Standing
Cybersecurity Hunt Teams that would operate with the consent and active
partnership of national governments and critical infrastructure network
operators. As Microsoft has explained the role of hunt teams, Standing
Cybersecurity Hunt Teams, acting in conjunction with national
capabilities, can contest the continuous cyber campaigns of Russia and
China. According to the US Department of Homeland Security, such hunt
teams can conduct deep technical analyses of live networks to identify
"previously unobserved threats." Standing Cybersecurity Hunt Teams, with
a focus on active defense, would expand on the capabilities of NATO's
current Cyber Rapid Reaction teams which are limited in numbers and
operate reactively.

While the cybersecurity of infrastructure and government systems is a
national responsibility, **[a breach of cybersecurity]{.underline}** at
the national level **[can have collective consequences.]{.underline}**
Standing Cybersecurity Hunt Teams can be a capability, as well as
connective tissue, to identify and mitigate cyber threats across
national boundaries and enhance NATO's collective defense. Standing
Cybersecurity Hunt Teams would be able to utilize information and
experience gained from contesting Russian and Chinese cyber-attacks
against one ally in the defense of others. A Standing Cybersecurity Hunt
Team can also serve in a capacity-building role to help allied nations
develop their own cyber capabilities, for example, in conjunction with
the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.

Third, **[NATO should coordinate]{.underline}** a strategy of persistent
engagement **[to reduce Russian and Chinese activities to undercut the
Alliance]{.underline}** in cyberspace. The concept of persistent
engagement was developed by US Cyber Command, but the rationale likewise
applies to NATO, deriving from the need to combat the continuous
campaigns of cyberattacks coming from Russia and China. Persistent
engagement involves tracking adversaries, understanding their goals,
analyzing the tools used for attacks, and taking actions to degrade
their capabilities to blunt ongoing, or prevent future, attacks. **[The
Alliance needs a persistent engagement cyber strategy as a key element
of its deterrence and defense.]{.underline}**

Customary international law, including the law of countermeasures, pleas
of necessity, and other cyber norms, provides the international legal
basis for a strategy of persistent engagement. Because NATO Allies have
already been attacked and are continuously being targeted by these
adversaries, [**offensive actions to counter** such activities **are
justified**,]{.underline} as long as they are conducted proportionately.
While persistent engagement arguably could increase instability in
cyberspace, **[Alliance inaction is far more dangerous.]{.underline}**
**[If Russia and China perceive no consequences to their malign
actions]{.underline}** in cyberspace, **[they will only continue and
even intensify them.]{.underline}**

#### Cyber cohesion key to preventing future military attacks

//DG

NATO has been generally successful in implementing the private sector of
their various nations into the cyber defense field and serves as an
example of the private cybersecurity industry aiding the public sector.
Through NCI Agency, the information technology, communications and cyber
defense arm of NATO, billions of dollars have been invested in private
companies from NATO countries to train and equip professionals in the
public field to defend against attacks. This is an example of successful
strategy that has also been used by the U.S. Department of Defense.
These investments show a common strategy among NATO member states which
has been extremely successful. **[Through sharing strategies and
information, the U.S. and NATO can learn from one another the best
means]{.underline}** to deter cyber aggression.

Working with NATO Counterparts

NATO was founded in 1949 with the full intention to "safeguard the
freedom, common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on
the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of
law\...to promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic
area."23 The 12 founding countries have since grown to 30 nations all
with the same goal of furthering security and prosperity in the North
Atlantic region. According to NATO, the alliance was formed to meet
three objectives: "\[to deter\] Soviet expansionism, \[forbid\] the
revival of nationalist militarism in Europe through a strong North
American presence on the continent and \[encourage\] European political
integration." 24 The expansion of NATO has driven the alliance closer to
its main aggressor, Russia, with the addition of four former Warsaw Pact
members (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Romania) and three
former-Soviet states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). This has broadened
NATO's responsibilities and increased the threat from Russian
interference in NATO activities.

NATO has focused heavily on cybersecurity since 2014 and as recently as
January 2022 re-emphasized their commitment to security in the fifth
domain: To keep pace with the rapidly changing threat landscape and
maintain robust cyber defenses, NATO adopted an enhanced policy and
action plan, which were endorsed by Allies at the Wales Summit in
September 2014. An updated action plan was endorsed by Allies in
February 2017. The 2014 policy established that cyber defense is part of
the Alliance's core task of collective defense, confirmed that
international law applies in cyberspace, set out the further development
of NATO's and Allies' capabilities, and intensified NATO's cooperation
with industry.25 NATO has recently alluded to a policy of physical
military action against any cyberattacks on member states: Appearing at
the Atlantic Council's headquarters in Washington ahead of NATO's summit
in Brussels, Stoltenberg said NATO did not distinguish between cyber
intrusions and other forms of attacks. He noted that cyber aggression
could trigger a military response through "other means." "In a way, it
doesn't matter whether it's a kinetic attack or a cyberattack, we will
assess as allies whether it meets the thresholds for triggering Article
5. It sends a message that we regard cyberattacks as seriously as any
other attack."26

This has yet to be implemented based solely on an aggression against a
member state, but the 2021--2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis can be traced
back to Russian cyberaggression against the Ukrainian central
government. The response by the United States and NATO allies is the
correct approach to a cyberattack from within the Russian Federation.
According to intel from the Ukrainian Government, hackers from within
the Russian Federation shut down major government websites on January
14, 2022, "The websites of the country's cabinet, seven ministries, the
treasury, the National Emergency Service, and the state services
website, where Ukrainians' electronic passports and vaccination
certificates are stored, were temporarily unavailable on Friday as a
result of the hack." 2

Russia coincided this aggressive action by building a significant
military force on Ukraine's eastern border, furthering the idea of
simultaneous kinetic and cyber aggression. NATO and the U.S. responded
accordingly by deploying troops to eastern Europe to defend the NATO
alliance and Ukraine from invasion: "Denmark, Spain, France and the
Netherlands were all planning or considering sending troops, planes or
ships to eastern Europe, NATO said. Ukraine shares borders with four
NATO countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania."28

**[The]{.underline}** 2021-2022 Russo-**[Ukrainian crisis is
revealing]{.underline}** of Russia's ultimate strategy in two ways.
Firstly, **[it is now clear that a cyberattack will more than likely
precede a kinetic attack]{.underline}**, especially when there is little
resistance to that aggression. Secondly, there will be more aggressive
action coming out of the Russian Federation and **[NATO and the U.S. are
not properly prepared on the cyber-defense front]{.underline}**. The
evidence for the latter point has been addressed earlier with the
examples of successful cyberattacks against the United States such as
the Colonial Pipeline and JBS infrastructure attacks as well as the
Notpetya attack.

NATO has been primarily concerned with building up cybersecurity in
member states. The next step, led by the United States, is to go on the
offensive and accurately identify the sources of these cyber
aggressions. On several occasions, Russia has been able to hide behind
the idea that the cyber-attackers are not state-affiliated and fiend
responsibility of aggressions from within the Federation: Three
successive U.S. administrations have failed to develop any form of
doctrine to adequately address increasingly problematic cyberattacks
from unattributable sources that plague U.S. businesses and can even
endanger lives. Instead, the private sector has been left to deal with
ever more destructive and dangerous ransomware attacks unassisted, and
Russia continues to do nothing about cyberattacks originating from
Russian territory.29

This is an epidemic that can be cured by shifting from a conservative
policy regarding the cyberworld and towards a more proactive position.
If the United States were able to identify actors with precision,
further measures could be taken to prevent attacks on the U.S.
infrastructure and on the private sector. In addition, being able to
identify these actors would allow the United States and its allies to
expose the perpetrators worldwide through media with solid evidence,
damaging the perpetrator state's reputation with the international
community. Once the United States can present solid evidence against
cyber criminals, **[the United States and NATO allies can]{.underline}**
**[take conjoint actions]{.underline}** voluntarily against the
perpetrator state/entity. This can be done **[through intelligence
sharing]{.underline}**, public statements of support for actions taken
following an attack, and participation in the charges taken against the
perpetrator state/entity. This strategy is reliant upon the ability of
the United States and its allies to accurately identify perpetrators
with a proactive joint campaign.

### I/L -- NATO Key

#### Lack of NATO leadership in cybersecurity policy and legal norms leaves the Alliance stuck in a reactive limbo

In its sixty-four year history, [NATO has been at the center of national
security challenges faced by members of the Alliance]{.underline},
whether the challenge involved confronting Soviet military power in
Europe, expanding its collective defense strategy in the postCold War
period, responding to humanitarian crises, or participating in efforts
to address international terrorism. [NATO's cyber defense strategy means
that the Alliance has started to deal with yet another security
threat]{.underline}, spurred in particular by the Estonia cyber crisis.
However, [despite the progress NATO has made with its operational
capabilities through NCIRC and its decision-making
processes]{.underline} [on cyber defense issues, NATO is
not,]{.underline} at present, [at the center of cybersecurity thinking
taking place within **the policy circles** in NATO members,]{.underline}
especially the United States[.]{.underline} [The **more NATO lags behind
in cybersecurity policy and law, the more the Alliance will be stuck in
a reactive mode**]{.underline}---a situation [that will **reduce NATO's
ability** to be a more **constructive platform for
cybersecurity**]{.underline} both within the Alliance and between NATO
and non-NATO countries[. NATO could proactively play a more significant
role in global cybersecurity but only if NATO members empower NATO to
lead]{.underline} rather than just trail behind.

#### International cooperation key to responding to cyberthreats

**Talihärm 13** (Anna-Maria Talihärm, Senior Analyst of the Legal and
Policy Branch, NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO
CCD COE), "Towards Cyberpeace: Managing Cyberwar Through International
Cooperation" UN, vol. L, no. 2, August 2013,
<https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/towards-cyberpeace-managing-cyberwar-through-international-cooperation>)
-lh

Malicious cyberactivities have been affecting individuals, private
entities, government institutions and non-governmental organizations for
years. We have witnessed large-scale cyber-incidents such as in Estonia
in 2007, with numerous sophisticated targeted attacks, hacktivism and
countless instances of identity theft and malware. [Due to the
unpredictable nature of cyberthreats, an incident that may appear in the
beginning as an act of hacktivism or]{.underline} financially [motivated
cybercrime may rapidly escalate into something much more serious and
reach the threshold of]{.underline} national security, even
[cyberwar.]{.underline}

Despite the lack of consensus on exactly what constitutes cyberwarfare
or cyberterrorism, governments need to ensure that their infrastructure
is well protected against different types of cyberthreats and that their
legal and policy frameworks would allow to effectively prevent, deter,
defend and mitigate possible cyberattacks. Not being able to agree on
common definitions of central terms such as "cyberattack" and "cyberwar"
should not prevent states from expressing the urgency of preparing their
nations for possible cyberincidents.

INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

The logic of international cooperation and collaboration lies on why,
when, and how to collaborate, and generally takes place in order to
follow one's interests or to manage common aversions.1 [In the context
of cybersecurity, the **need for international cooperation** between
states, international and regional organizations and other entities is
emphasized by the borderless and increasingly sophisticated nature of
cyberthreats.]{.underline} Principally, any actor, whether it is a
country or a non-governmental organization, [following its objectives in
cybersecurity requires cooperation from a wide range of international
partners.]{.underline} In fact, much of the international collaboration
will occur outside specific national frameworks, emphasizing the Whole
of System approach that stresses the need to take into account all
relevant stakeholders.2

Thus, from a national perspective, advancements in cybersecurity depend
to a large extent on the political will of different actors. [Areas such
as information and intelligence sharing and mutual assistance may become
essential in responding to a cybercrisis, but the effectiveness of such
cooperation **depends greatly upon strategically aligned policy goals
and bilateral and multilateral relations**.]{.underline} In many
domains, such as international criminal cooperation, there are several
preconditions that need to be in place in the cooperating countries,
such as substantive national law as well as procedural law and
international agreements, before the dialogue on the possibility of any
sort of international cooperation can grow into further discussions on
the efficiency of such cooperation.

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVE IN CYBERSECURITY

National policies, international agreements as well as other initiatives
addressing cybersecurity that are being proposed and launched by
different international, regional and national actors may vary
considerably in their scope, aim and success, but they all underline the
international dimension of cyberspace.

For example, the United Nations First Committee has been actively
examining the Developments in the Field of Information and
Telecommunications in the Context of International Security for years.
The African Union has published the Draft African Union Convention on
the Establishment of a Credible Legal Framework for Cyber Security in
Africa. The European Union (EU) has recently published a Joint
Communication on the Cyber Security Strategy of the European Union,
which is the first attempt for a comprehensive EU policy document in
this domain to reflect the common view on cybersecurity of all its 27
member states.

Even though in recent years the wider debate has intensified on the
development of possible norms of behaviour or a set of
confidence-building measures in the cybersecurity domain, it should not
be forgotten that most of the pressing issues and challenges in areas
related to cybersecurity have roots in the adoption and review of
national legislation and the implementation of multilaterally agreed
principles.

PRINCIPLE DEVELOPMENTS

The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence ([NATO CCD
COE]{.underline}) is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
accredited international military organization that focuses on a range
of aspects related to cybersecurity, such as education, analyses,
consultation, lessons learned, research and development. Even though the
Centre does not belong to the direct command line of NATO, its [mission
is to enhance the capability, **cooperation and information sharing
among NATO**, NATO nations and partners in cyberdefence.]{.underline}

Determined that international cooperation is key to the successful
mitigation of cyberthreats worldwide, the [Centre invests not only in
broader **collaboration with NATO**]{.underline} and EU entities but,
more specifically, focuses on improving practical cooperation within and
among its sponsoring nations by hosting a real time network defence
exercise known as Locked Shields. It also participates in many other
similar simulations, thereby allowing the participants to put national
coordination and cooperation frameworks to practise, and to learn and
test the skills needed to fend off a real attack.

Regarding the legal and policy aspects of cybersecurity, NATO CCD COE
has identified two main trends. Firstly, a growing number of countries
are adopting national cybersecurity strategies and the majority of these
documents confirm the role of cybersecurity as a national security
priority. To further analyse such a development and the concept of
national cybersecurity strategies, the Centre has conducted a
comparative study called the National Cyber Security Framework Manual.
The research asserts that a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy needs
to take into account a number of national stakeholders with various
responsibilities in ensuring national cybersecurity. The national
stakeholders include critical infrastructure providers, law enforcement
agencies, international organizations, computer emergency response teams
and entities ensuring internal and external security. Importantly,
instead of viewing cybersecurity as a combination of segregated areas or
isolated stakeholders, the activities of different subdomains and areas
of competence should be coordinated. Secondly, there are ongoing
discussions about the applicability of international law to
cyberactivities. Whereas it is widely accepted that cyberspace needs to
be protected like air, sea and land, and is clearly defined by NATO
Strategic Concept as a threat that can possibly reach a threshold
setting threatening national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity, security and
stability, there are only a few international agreements that would
directly address behaviour in cyberspace.

Agreeing on a common stance even in matters regarding well-established
norms of customary international law, such as the prohibition of the use
of force codified in the United Nations Charter, Article 2(4), together
with the two exceptions of self-defence and a resolution by the Security
Council, in the context of their applicability to the cyberdomain
remains a challenging task for the involved parties.

Therefore, amid the complex legal issues surrounding these debates, in
2009 NATO CCD COE invited an independent International Group of Experts
to examine whether existing international law applies to issues
regarding cybersecurity and, if so, to what extent. The result of this
three-year project, the Tallinn Manual on the International Law
Applicable to Cyber Warfare, focuses on the jus ad bellum, the
international law governing the resort to force by states as an
instrument of their national policy, and the jus in bello, the
international law regulating the conduct of armed conflict. The experts
taking part in the project concluded that, in principle, jus ad bellum
and jus in bello do apply in the cyber context but this may be altered
by state practice. [This]{.underline} and other opinions expressed in
the Tallinn Manual should not be considered as an official declaration
of any state or organization, but rather as the interpretation of the
group of individual international experts acting solely in their
personal capacity. The Manual does not, however, address cyberactivities
that occur below the threshold of a use of force, and for that purpose
NATO CCD COE has launched a follow-on three-year project entitled
Tallinn 2.0.

[In order to prepare nations for possible cyberincidents and ensure a
solid ground for international cooperation,]{.underline} both
comprehensive national cybersecurity strategies and a [common
understanding on the applicability of the international law are
required.]{.underline}

Even though it has been argued that multilateral treaties are the most
practical vehicles for harmonizing national legal systems and aligning
the interpretation of existing international law, discussions about
moving towards such an agreement on a global level appear to be at a
very early stage. [Given the current normative ambiguity surrounding
international law in the context of cybersecurity, **international
cooperation between different actors is deemed to be the cornerstone of
effective responses to cyberthreats**]{.underline}.

### I/L -- AT A/C

#### No alt causes -- NATO's greatest threat is cyber & failure to create consensus on that is what turns into collapse

AND NATO STRATEGY" Published January 25, 2022.

//DG

NATO's shift to incorporating offensive cyber operations into existing
strategy and policy has focused on integrating offensive effects into
conventional military plans and operations in the context of a conflict.
While **[NATO's]{.underline}** updated **[strategy]{.underline}** is a
positive development, its limited focus on conflict scenarios for
employing cyber power **[fails to accurately account for the cyber
threat environment NATO faces]{.underline}**---particularly the mismatch
between the alliance's clear distinction between wartime and peacetime
and the approach of adversaries like Russia, who adopt a
competition-conflict continuum. Additionally, the focus on employing
offensive cyber during a high-end conventional fight is also not
consistent with how several NATO members are already engaged in gray
zone offensive cyber operations.

**[The primary threat to NATO allies]{.underline}** in the cyber domain
**[is]{.underline}** not **[from]{.underline}** high-end, decisive
cyberattacks. Instead, cyber threats more frequently and effectively
manifest as gray zone tactics designed to have a corrosive effect
without rising to the level of warfare. There are numerous examples of
this type of threat. For instance, in July 2021, NATO publicly condemned
**[a range of malicious cyber behavior]{.underline}**, including the
Microsoft Exchange hack (which NATO attributed to China) and ransomware
attacks targeting critical infrastructure. **[Russia has leveraged cyber
and disinformation operations]{.underline}** to interfere in democratic
elections in the United States in 2016, 2018, and 2020; France in 2017;
and Germany in 2017 and 2021---to name just a few examples. Russia also
conducted distributed denial-of-service cyberattacks against government
websites in Montenegro during the lead-up to, and following,
Montenegro's ascension to NATO in 2017. And when NATO forces were
positioned in the Baltics beginning in 2017 as part of NATO's enhanced
forward presence, two threat actors, GhostWriter and Secondary
Infektion, conducted a range of disinformation campaigns.

Additionally, the reality is that several NATO members are already
speaking publicly about offensive cyber operations below the level of
warfare and their statements and actions have an effect on the entire
alliance. In particular, **[NATO member nations have not reached a
political consensus about the role of offensive cyber
operations]{.underline}**. In 2018, the US Department of Defense and US
Cyber Command issued new strategy and policy documents that articulated
a role for the military in conducting offensive cyber operations below
the level of armed conflict outside of US-controlled cyberspace (part of
the "defend forward" strategy), and there has been some reporting about
US offensive cyber operations. For instance, in 2018 the United States
disrupted the Russian-linked Internet Research Agency from interfering
in the midterm elections. And, more recently, in December 2021 General
Paul Nakasone, commander of US Cyber Command, publicly acknowledged that
the military played a role in disrupting ransomware groups targeting
critical infrastructure. The United States has also worked with other
NATO allies, such as Estonia and Montenegro, to conduct "hunt forward"
cyber operations on allied and partner networks to uncover and disrupt
malicious cyber activity.

Other NATO allies have also been more transparent about offensive cyber
operations. In 2020, the United Kingdom announced a significant
investment in its National Cyber Force, its organizational arm for
offensive cyber operations, and its 2022 National Cyber Strategy
emphasized the role of offensive cyber operations. In November 2021,
General Nakasone and the director of Government Communications
Headquarters---the UK government's principal signals intelligence
agency---stated jointly that the two governments were collaborating to
"impose consequences" in cyberspace to disrupt adversary operations. The
Netherlands has also publicly alluded to conducting offensive cyber
operations.

Next Steps: Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks

Given the threat environment facing NATO, as well as the activities of
several NATO members, **[the alliance should
deliberately]{.underline}**---but purposefully---consider
**[incorporate]{.underline}** **[offensive cyber
operations]{.underline}** below the level of armed conflict into its
deterrence strategy. Any effort to explore a role for offensive cyber
operations should also consider the challenges and risks that may come
with doing so. A central challenge is that, at the political level, NATO
allies lack consensus on the appropriate application of offensive cyber
power---especially below the level of armed conflict. Addressing these
disagreements among member states is essential because conducting
offensive cyber operations often requires maneuvering through or
operating on networks controlled by an ally or allies. **[Right now,
NATO members do not collectively agree on the protocols]{.underline}**
and processes for partner actions in allied networks---and they also
disagree on how to define sovereignty in cyberspace, or when an
offensive cyber operation would rise to the level of an armed attack.

Offensive cyber operations for NATO also present real interoperability
challenges. The role of intelligence in cyber operations is likely to
complicate NATO planning processes. Even close allies are likely to be
wary about sharing sensitive intelligence for a number of reasons. For
instance, they may be averse to sharing information gleaned from signals
intelligence collection or because a member state may be using the same
exploits for both offensive action and their own espionage---including
intelligence collection against allies. Or, allies may simply be worried
that sensitive information may become exposed. On top of this, it's
challenging to adjudicate intelligence requirements among allies and to
deconflict intelligence and military priorities. It is also
**[not]{.underline}** clear whether the alliance has **[established
consensus]{.underline}** thresholds that specify the conditions and
timeline under which a state would have to notify others of its
activities on their networks---if at all.

#### NATO is key to establishing global cybersecurity norms

Marshall Fund of the United States. He focuses primarily on NATO,

the Black Sea region, and cybersecurity. "Policy Brief: The Paris Call
and Activating Global Norms" Published March 2021.

// DG

The United Nations is unique because it convenes the full spectrum of
global views and interests. But there are other international
organizations and smaller groupings of countries that can be engaged by
the Paris Call community to indirectly influence the UN processes and to
**[advance the debate of norm creation and
implementation]{.underline}**. These gather diverse key players, their
structures are more flexible, they possess a credible level of
expertise, they often have more experience working with non-state
actors, and they carry enough weight to negotiate on an equal footing
with big countries like China or at the UN level. Projects can be
developed in smaller bodies and then more easily transferred to the UN.
The EU, ASEAN, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development, or the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
are experienced in working with multiple stakeholders and are a good
place to engage in policy experimentation and vetting.
**[NATO]{.underline}** could **[offer a good platform to
introduce]{.underline}** new **[ideas around a transatlantic zone of
cyber stability.]{.underline}**

The Paris Call community should also look at relevant geographic
clusters. This would make it easier to identify local attitudes and
policy goals, and to create projects of common interests. Initiatives
could, for example**[, feature regions with exemplary cyber behavior as
a role model or connect cluster of countries with other clusters and
assist them in implementing norms of responsible cyber
behavior.]{.underline}** The **[goal would be to build an
ever-increasing number of geographic pockets of cyber
stability.]{.underline}** A good example of this is how the Baltic
states cooperate on cyber-hygiene initiatives in the public sector and
exchange best practices. There have also been efforts between the EU and
the United States to strengthen cooperation on the global norms debate,
despite the U.S. government not having signed the Paris Call yet. In
other words, to act globally the Paris Call also must think regionally.

A relative latecomer to the cyber game, [NATO is beginning to
"operationalize" cyber capabilities into its overall structure by
integrating those tools of member nations]{.underline}, said the
alliance's secretary general.

"We are tackling increasingly complex cyberthreats faster and more
efficiently. And we are more aware of the threats, more resilient to
incidents," Jens Stoltenberg said May 23 at the Cyber Defense Pledge
Conference in London. "We also need to consider how we can deter attacks
in cyberspace."

Top [NATO officials have long maintained]{.underline} that [the
29-nation alliance is **defensive in nature** with a mission of
deterrence,]{.underline} implying that [the body itself doesn't engage
in offensive maneuvers, including in cyberspace.]{.underline}

As such, Stoltenberg noted that part of deterring cyberattacks is
attribution.

"Cyber attackers must know that they will be exposed," he said, citing a
thwarted attempt by Russian intelligence operatives to hack the
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague in
October.

Conversely, Stoltenberg said, [NATO must be ready to use cyber
capabilities to fight enemies]{.underline}.

NATO has walked a fine line as a defensive organization, relying on the
individual capabilities of member states. As an example, Stoltenberg
pointed to allies conducting cyber operations against the Islamic State
group in Iraq and Syria.

"[By using national cyber effects]{.underline}, or offensive cyber,
[they suppressed ISIS propaganda, degraded their ability to coordinate
attacks and disrupted their recruitment of foreign
fighters]{.underline}," he said. "[**We have agreed to integrate
national cyber capabilities** or offensive cyber into alliance
operations and missions.]{.underline} All of this has made NATO more
effective in cyberspace."

Several experts have said [members states that are both **willing and
capable of offensive operations** number about a half
dozen]{.underline}. [Without a NATO-owned offensive
capability]{.underline}, officials have noted that [contesting
adversaries in cyberspace is no simple endeavor.]{.underline}

"This is true for the air, the land, the maritime domain, and it has to
become true --- I'm careful on that --- for the cyber domain or
cyberspace as a domain of operations," he said at a November 2018
conference. "This is what really we have to find out, and I address this
is a difficult part because NATO is defensive and is a defensive
alliance."

And adversaries must be wary that cyberattacks could engender responses
in other domains, said Stoltenberg.

"[For deterrence to have **full effect**, potential attackers must know
that **we are not limited to respond** in cyberspace when we are
attacked in cyberspace. We can and we will use the full range of
capabilities at our disposa]{.underline}l," he said, reiterating that a
cyberattack on a member state could trigger the famed Article 5, in
which an attack on one member is considered an attack on all members.

For 70 years, NATO has kept our people safe in the physical world. Now
NATO needs to do the same in the cyber world," he added. "We have seen
that now in cyberspace we had a remarkable increase in our capabilities
to defend our networks to stand together, to integrate offensive cyber
intermissions and operations, and we have done that over the last
years."

However, NATO is not responsible for defending individual member nations
in cyberspace; members agreed in 2016 to boost their respective cyber
defense capabilities.

But [in July 2018, NATO created a Cyber Operations Center]{.underline}.
It opened in August 2018 with a three-pronged mission:

Provide situational awareness in cyberspace.

Plan allied cyberspace operations.

Manage the execution of operations.

The center's deputy director, U.S. Air Force Col. Don Lewis, wrote that
it serves as the theater component for cyberspace similar to how
geographic commands cover specific physical domains. [The center
executes operational-level and strategic missions to provide commanders
with domain advice, planning support and capability
integration.]{.underline}

Just as in the physical space, but in some cases more pertinent in the
cyber domain, [deconfliction of efforts is critical to ensure friendly
forces aren't interfering with each other and compromising the
mission]{.underline}. The center seeks to play a part in that role.

["But still,\"]{.underline} he noted, [\"it's a national

### 2AC -- No Link \[Covert\]

#### NATO does legal coordination through secret MOUs

Andrés B. **Muñoz Mosquera 16**, Legal Advisor, Director, at NATO
Supreme Headquarters Allied Power, Europe - Allied Command Operations,
October 2016, "Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU): A Philosophical and
Empirical Approach (Part II)," NATO Legal Gazette, Issue #37, p. 34-38

The NATO Legal Deskbook briefly characterises MOUs as follows: "[The
form of [MOU is frequently used to record]{.mark} informal
[arrangements]{.mark} between States on matters which are inappropriate
for inclusion in treaties or [where the form is more convenient than a
treaty (e.g. **for** **confidentiality**]{.mark}).]{.underline} They may
be drawn up as a single document using non-treaty terms, signed on
behalf of two or more governments, or consist of an exchange of notes or
letters recording an understanding reached between two governments, or a
government and an international organization. [MOUs usually do not
require ratification.]{.underline} However depending on the content and
the agreement between the Parties on the nature of the document, MOUs
can be subject of a certain level of domestic
ratification...[[NATO,]{.mark} in general, [concludes MOUs in numerous
occasions]{.mark}. MOUs are a very flexible and adaptable instrument to
record the will of entities with legal personality to achieve practical
results that do not amount to treaty obligations."]{.underline}

How are MOUs practiced? There are several 'schools' of practice that
nations and international organisations have developed, with different
references to this practice in the British-law influential area5,
continental European states and the United States.6 Aust highlights that
in all of these areas, MOUs are considered 'agreements without
legally-binding force' and refers to the European Commission document
PESC/SEC 899 of 9 August 1996 to support his argument. Aust also admits
that in certain circumstances nonbinding becomes binding.7 However,
practice shows that states have different approaches depending on their
political approach to the topic or topics addressed in specific MOUs.8

At this point, it is relevant to note the process for creating MOUs at
NATO, a 'classic' international organisation practicing
intergovernmentalism. At NATO, during the decision making process,
members may reaffirm their sovereignty9, several times, by supporting or
opposing the existence of an MOU in their collective realm. One wonders
if in the process of creating MOU organisations or simple MOU
initiatives there is any other international organisation in the world
that gives its members so many opportunities to express their
'super-will'10 with respect to scope and purpose, as well as to the
provisions of MOUs, which are intended to implement the obligations
under the foundational treaty. These treaty obligations are updated by
an established practice that operates through the decisions taken, in
general per the practice of consensus, by its highest decision making
bodies. It is necessary to note that this consensual commitment does not
only have a collective nature, as consensus reflects ineludibly the
individual commitment of each of the NATO members on any specific
decision taken by the Council for creating a concept supported by an
MOU. In the Council's decision, states do not particularly address the
non-binding status of the MOUs. In fact, the non-binding status
discussion rarely happens before the MOU text negotiations start and,
normally, ends at national level exclusively mandated by political
approaches or national legislation. This acts as almost pro-forma
language applied dependent on a states' individual practice and
perspective, irrespective of the actual points negotiated in the MOU.

Consequently, are MOUs non-binding documents by default? How valid is
the written commitment of the participants? Could the 'bindingness' 11
created in a non-binding environment lead to legal effects? This battery
of 'tricky' questions, partially addressed ut supra, takes us outward to
square one and convinces us that the law of parsimony fed by anterior
facts and posterior behaviour surrounding the life of an MOU has to be
taken into account seriously when determining its legal effects.

In this regard, MOUs are chosen for cross-border relations because there
has been a previous political commitment or the basic principles of
framework treaties have been implemented. The form of negotiations does
not vary from that of a treaty, and in general, although there is a
tendency to use lax or soft wording vis-à-vis treaties, the treaty
negotiation strategies are clearly displayed. MOU texts, contrary to
popular belief, have little flexibility for review once agreed upon. As
such, MOU drafters incorporate predictable 'mobile' elements through
annexes to MOUs, which negotiators assume can be opened by lower level
managers, though it always requires a 'political' mandate either
directly or indirectly.12 MOU practice shows that it is not common to
incorporate reservations (statements of interpretation). However, these
have recently found their way into MOUs carrying heavy and long-term
financial commitments within their provisions

Compared to treaties, [MOUs have, in general, shorter internal
coordination processes for approval, and **few states pass them through
parliament or their commissions**.]{.underline} Moreover, since most
MOUs have some financial clauses related to budget and taxes, many
negotiators regularly announce that their parliaments or specialised
commissions need to give their approval before the state in question can
consider the text of the MOU agreed upon.

Another example of how MOUs trigger complicated internal coordination
processes is seen in the Host Nation Support Arrangements13 negotiated
with states not party to the North Atlantic Treaty and other NATO
treaties. The fact of not counting on those treaties initiates a
parallel process of negotiations for concluding treaties14 on status of
forces and international military headquarters. [These treaties commonly
address an array of matters that range from entering and staying in
foreign territory, taxes and customs, wearing uniforms, holding weapons,
policing compounds, claim waivers, freedom of movement, concurrent
jurisdiction, etc.]{.underline} In addition[, another significant factor
is that [due to confidentiality, **MOUs are published only at the level
of**]{.mark} **for [official use]{.mark} only, [as most]{.mark} of them
[are]{.mark} [classified.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

We must also say that [[MOUs often]{.mark} serve multiple purposes and
are drafted to [create a **cooperation** framework. This]{.mark} may
require establishing understandings via joint procedures, or creating a
sophisticated network of structures and procedures that would require
detaching states' resources abroad, **which [in turn increases their
level of commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline} and, inextricably, their
expectations vis-à-vis the other participants.

Finally, we cannot conclude this section without referring to [MOUs as
implanting rules]{.underline}. Cross-border relations have, since
ancient history, required minimum sets of principles that, in accordance
with Dworkin, have the nature of standards that carry more weight in
form of precise rules.15 This reality has been documented, for more than
five thousand years, and ['\[a\]ll groups of nations in regular contact
had in practice adopted certain rules defining the conduct which could
usually be expected among their members.'16]{.underline}

The principle of good faith is linked to that of estoppel, which leads
us to address briefly the consequence of conflicts within MOUs.17 Since
[[MOUs enjoy 'all' of the elements and principles that treaties
do]{.underline}]{.mark}, we may warily open the Pandora's Box of state
responsibility, which cannot be addressed in this article. But is it
true that state responsibility applies for MOUs, and is there any legal
effect? [MOU participants reach a consensual engagement reflected in the
MOU provisions, which obliges those participants to communicate
unilateral acts that can have legal effects. If those acts, fruits of a
consensual engagement, are committed contrary to good faith by any
participant, they are considered unfriendly acts and will, in certain
cases, **be void.**]{.underline} Therefore, they will be subject, at the
least, to retorsion, which is nothing other than a non-amicable act of
retaliation within the bounds of proportionality, and based on good
faith, common sense, and reasonableness.18 But what about justice and
MOUs?

#### NATO's info security is air tight\-\--secrets will never leak

Penalties for unauthorized disclosure. The [[security policy]{.mark}
adopted by the Council]{.underline} in March 1955 [[made clear that
\"disciplinary action\" was to be taken \"against any individual who is
responsible for]{.mark} the [compromise of NATO classified
information.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}\' 12 No comparable provision was
included in earlier policies. However, a series of substantial leaks in
1952 and 1953 demonstrated the need for firmer rules, and resulted in
increased pressure on member states to adopt criminal penalties for
unauthorized release of NATO information.\' 1

Frustration with leaks peaked after a meeting of the Council in April
1953.1 14 The main aim of the meeting was the resolution of the
sensitive issue of how much each nation would contribute toward a £250
million defense infrastructure program. The New York Times published
details of the proposed plan two weeks before the meeting.1 15 A week
later, the Times, London\'s Daily Telegraph, and the Associated Press
simultaneously published details of NATO\'s plans for production of
fighter aircraft. Matters deteriorated during the meeting when Le Monde
reproduced the agenda and provided a running summary of the talks, while
the Times summarized American and British background reports on
relations with the Soviet Union.\' 16 Major press services transmitted
the final communique hours before the NATO secretariat formally released
it. Later, the Times excerpted a secret paper on Soviet-Chinese
relations discussed at the meeting. \' \' 7

[In May 1953, Secretary General Ismay told the Council that leaks such
as these posed a \"grave threat\" to NATO\'s effectiveness. The NATO
Council directed the Security Committee to study \"the extent to which
each member government could take legal action in respect of leakages of
NATO classified information . .. \[and\] report to the Council as soon
as possible with regard to any practical steps that could be taken to
ensure that leakages of NATO classified information would not occur in
future.\"\'\"]{.underline} 8

The Security Committee made a ten-month study of state secrets laws and
reported to Council in March 1954. Only three countries-France, Italy,
and Turkey-had clear criminal penalties for the unauthorized disclosure
of NATO classified information. (In fact, France recently had modified
its law to address this issue, perhaps in response to the leaks
controversy.\' 19) Many countries were found to have state secrets laws
that were deficient or ambiguously worded. Two of these countries,
Belgium and the Netherlands, reported that they were contemplating
amendments to address problems with their state secrets laws.
[[The]{.mark} Security [Committee recommended]{.mark} that [governments
consider \"suitable supplementary legislation\" to ensure]{.mark} that
**there would be [criminal sanctions for leaking NATO
information]{.mark}.\'** 20 The Council endorsed the recommendation.\'
2\']{.underline}

[In August 1954, the Standing Group considered the problem of leaks. Its
draft overhaul of the NATO security policy included a new section
dedicated to the problem of \"leakages of information to the press.\"\'
2 2 It proposed that national security authorities should have the duty
to immediately investigate leaks and take \"disciplinary action\"
against leakers.]{.underline} The Standing Group later added another
proposal, giving the NATO Security Bureau the authority to coordinate
with national authorities on leak investigations. 12 3 Comparable rules
are found in the final version of the policy adopted by the Council in
March 1955.

[The subject did not rest there. The]{.underline} chairman of the
Security Committee, apparently dismayed by governments\' response to the
Committee\'s 1954 recommendation on reform of national laws, returned to
the subject in a January 1956 meeting. \"To make the position quite
clear,\" [the chairman said, governments were to answer five questions
about their state secrets laws:]{.underline}

1\) Is a NATO secret considered to be a \"State secret\"? (2) Can any
person guilty of disclosing a \"State secret\" be prosecuted whether he
be a member of the Government, an official or a private citizen? (3) Is
the charge the same for a person who intentionally discloses a secret
and for one who does so by negligence? (4) Can a person who discloses a
\"State secret\" or a NATO secret be prosecuted in a country when the
offence has been committed outside that country? (5) Can a country
prosecute a foreigner who has disclosed a NATO secret on its territory?
124

[Most countries answered that their national legislation provided
adequate protection.]{.underline} Denmark responded that its law had
been modified in April 1955 to address these issues, while Belgium said
that statutory changes had been introduced in April 1956. The Greek
government also reported that \"necessary steps to revise legislation to
cover all possible cases\" were being taken.12

Ironically, in the United States, sanctions for unauthorized disclosure
of classified information remained weak. Congress refused to enact
criminal penalties except in narrowly defined circumstances, such as the
disclosure of atomic information or deliberate disclosure to foreign
agents. 1 26 The American representative to NATO conceded the inadequacy
of these measures in his report to the Security Committee. 127 In March
1955, the Department of Justice told Congress that it had broader
penalties under \"active consideration.\" \' 28 A bipartisan commission
on government security established in August 1955 recommended wider
criminal sanctions, 1 29 but Congress again failed to act.

III\. EVIDENCE OF CONTINUING INFLUENCE

The tension between domestic policies on access to information and
intergovernmental obligations continues to be evident among NATO\'s
older member states. One critical conflict concerns the treatment of
information received from other governments, or intergovernmental
organizations such as NATO, under domestic access-to-information laws.
[[Adopted after]{.mark} the [establishment of the NATO security
regime]{.mark}, these [laws have been drafted to accommodate]{.mark} the
principle of originator control that is entrenched in [NATO SOI
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Governments have resisted calls for
loosening this rule in national access-to-information laws, but have
rarely acknowledged that national policy is constrained by
intergovernmental commitments. Consequently, many domestic policy actors
continue under the misapprehension that the content of national policy
can be decided in national fora.

Canada. Debate over Canada\'s Access to Information Act (ATIA)
illustrates the problem. The law obliges the Canadian government to deny
any request for access to information provided in confidence by other
states or international organizations of states unless the originator
consents to its release. \' 30 In 1987, a parliamentary committee
recommended that the law be amended to give the government discretion to
release such information when disclosure seemed unlikely to cause harm.
131 Canada\'s Information Commissioner later gave qualified support to
the proposal. 132 The Canadian government has consistently resisted
these proposals. In 1987, it argued that weakening the originator
control rule would impair \"\[tihe willingness of other governments to
continue to share their information.\" \' 33 More recently, it has said
that any reform would \"set Canada apart from its key allies.\"13 4 This
may be an indirect way of making clear the fundamental problem: that
reform of this part of the ATIA would create a conflict between national
law and Canada\'s obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty. Canada
cannot explicitly acknowledge the potential conflict, because this would
constitute a non-consensual disclosure of the substance of NATO\'s
security policy. As a result, many Canadians continue to believe that
reform is a matter that can be settled on the merits by domestic actors.

United Kingdom. The same misapprehension may prevail in other
jurisdictions. In 1999, the British government was criticized for
incorporating the originator control rule in its draft Freedom of
Information Act. 135 The Campaign for Freedom of Information, a
non-governmental organization, described this as an \"indiscriminate\"
exemption that would allow the withholding of \"harmless information.\"
13 6 Parliamentarians attempted to have the provision amended, but the
government opposed these proposals on the grounds that they would
violate a universally recognized norm of confidentiality. 137 It failed
to explain that the government was constrained by more than convention:
such an amendment would create a conflict between statutory and
intergovernmental obligations. Similar complaints were made against a
comparable provision in the new Scottish Freedom of Information Act.\'
38 However, the Scottish government was explicitly constrained by the
agreement governing the delegation of power to Scotland from the United
Kingdom, which required Scotland to respect the terms of
C-M(55)15(Final). 13

United States[. [In the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, debate about the
degree of protection to be given to information provided by foreign
governments was stirred by the 1998 case of Weatherhead v. United
States.]{.underline} 1 40 At the center of that case was the question of
whether the judiciary should be permitted to consider the reasonableness
of the U.S. government\'s decision to withhold a communication from the
British government. Advocates for transparency argued in favor of the
court\'s power to intervene, saying that it was indefensible in an open
society to support a policy of absolute secrecy for inter-governmental
communications, and that foreign governments could not reasonably expect
total secrecy. 141

[The case did not involve NATO communications, however, the transparency
advocates\' case was probably overstated.]{.underline} As the NATO
policy shows, there are clearly domains where other governments do have
a reasonable expectation of complete secrecy, based on the existence of
an SO agreement. [Furthermore, [the capacity of the judiciary to
intervene and impose the right balance on questions of disclosure is
exaggerated. **The effect of NATO\'s SOI policy is to deny domestic
actors,**]{.mark} including the courts, **[the opportunity to
make]{.mark} their own [decisions about]{.mark} the [disclosure of
information]{.mark} within a certain policy domain. 14 2**]{.underline}

B. U.S. Political Arrangements

[Just as states conclude politically binding (but legally non-binding)
commitments in the public context that are intended to set parameters
for their interactions, so too do [**states conclude politically binding
commitments in secret**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Further, there is reason
to think that states adhere to these politically binding secret
commitments with some regularity.

1\. Secret Political Arrangements in U.S. Law

Section A identified a group of agreements that meet the definition of
"treaty" found in the VCLT. But there are almost certainly many more
secret arrangements that states do not intend to be governed by
international law.35 In common parlance, these are political
arrangements that happen to be secret. [[Some]{.mark} of these
[arrangements]{.mark}, which [set]{.mark} out [rules]{.mark} or modes of
operation to be followed in one or more interactions [between or among
states]{.mark}, are surprisingly detailed. **[A]{.mark} paradigmatic
[example would be a secret]{.mark} memorandum of understanding
([MOU]{.mark}) between the U.S. Defense Department and a foreign
military agency [to guide]{.mark} specific types of [intelligence
interactions]{.mark}.**]{.underline}36 Other examples include
arrangements between the CIA and its foreign counterparts and oral or
tacit arrangements between the United States and foreign states, the
legal status of which may be ambiguous. Pakistan's reported consent to
the U.S. use of armed drones to target individual members of al Qaeda in
the Federally Administered Tribal Areas may reflect such a secret tacit
arrangement.37 Some of these secret arrangements explicitly state that
the parties do not intend them to create legally binding obligations.38

[Compared to secret agreements (at least those to which the United
States is a party), [secret arrangements]{.mark} often [are seen and
approved by fewer people because **the Executive has no statutory
obligation to transmit them to Congress.**]{.mark}]{.underline}39 The
Case Act establishes a mechanism by which the Department of State (DOS)
should be informed of these arrangements, so that the DOS can determine
whether the arrangement is or is not an international agreement.40
However, it is not clear that each agency actually shares every one of
its arrangements with the DOS. [Some arrangements may be highly
classified, which might make the initiating agency reluctant to share
the arrangement's contents.]{.underline} Alternatively, agencies may
have worked out a modus vivendi with the DOS, whereby the DOS determines
that certain categories of arrangements do not represent international
agreements and thus effectively blesses another agency's conclusion of
such arrangements without DOS involvement.

[The fact that only a limited number of people and a limited category of
people are aware of these arrangements means several
things.]{.underline} First, the arrangements constitute what Professor
David Pozen has referred to as ["deep secrets."41 That is, these
arrangements are often "unknown unknowns," where [the **public is
generally unaware that the arrangements even
exist**.]{.mark}]{.underline}42 (In contrast, an agreement is a shallow
secret when the public knows that a particular secret agreement exists,
but does not know the content of the agreement.) [Less is known about
these arrangements [because **there are fewer players in a position
within either government to leak them to the press or the
public**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Second, the arrangements almost
surely contain narrower national undertakings than do secret agreements
(of which Congress and the DOS, as well as the originating agency, at a
minimum, are aware). If only a single agency---or a limited set of
actors within an agency---knows of the arrangement, its implementation
by definition cannot require the involvement of large numbers of
government officials.

Compared to secret agreements, it is even more difficult to estimate the
number of secret arrangements between the United States and other
states. This is because [many of them are negotiated by intelligence
agencies, which tend to be the best secret-keepers within
governments.]{.underline} Jeffrey Richelson and Desmond Ball assert that
over 1,000 intelligence arrangements exist among the five states that
are parties to the Five Eyes agreement (the United States, United
Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand).43 Richelson describes
[some of them, including arrangements regarding defense intelligence
analysis,]{.underline}44 [ocean surveillance]{.underline},45 [and
satellite imagery exchanges]{.underline}.46 Secret arrangements also
exist between various U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies.47 The U.S.
CIA reportedly has established connections with more than 400 foreign
agencies, which almost certainly entails concluding secret arrangements
with some of those agencies.48 Likewise, the CIA's Canadian equivalent
has more than 250 intelligence-sharing arrangements with foreign
intelligence entities.49 These arrangements may take the form of
memoranda of understanding or even oral agreements between intelligence
officials.50 Defense agencies also seem to conclude a wide variety of
secret cooperative arrangements.51

#### Foreign policy doesn't matter on the political stage

Dr. James M. **Lindsay 20**, Senior Vice President, Director of Studies,

Science from the University of Michigan, "Campaign Foreign Policy
Roundup: Foreign Policy Is AWOL", Council on Foreign Relations,
9/11/2020,
<https://www.cfr.org/blog/campaign-foreign-policy-roundup-foreign-policy-awol>

Today on the nineteenth anniversary of September 11 [[it is **notable
how little of the 2020 presidential campaign has been about foreign
policy**]{.mark}**.** It's not just terrorism that has receded from the
headlines. The same could be said about China, Russia, Iran, and a whole
host of other issues.]{.underline}

[To an extent, [the fact that foreign policy has been AWOL]{.mark} on
the campaign trail [isn't surprising. Domestic issues typically
dominate]{.mark} presidential campaigns, [and COVID-19 is]{.mark}
perhaps t[he mother of all domestic issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} It has
upended the economy, disrupted daily life, and exacerbated existing
racial and social inequalities. [Even so, it was only a few months ago
that some experts were speculating that COVID-19 would catapult U.S.
policy toward China to the forefront of the campaign and give Donald
Trump a cudgel with which to beat Joe Biden. So far that hasn't
happened.]{.underline}

This state of affairs seems to fit the public mood. [[A Pew survey of
registered voters]{.mark} conducted this summer [found that 57 percent
of registered voters said that foreign policy was "very important" to
them]{.mark} when voting.]{.underline} [[That sounds]{.mark} like an
[impressive]{.mark} figure, [but 79 percent of respondents flagged the
economy]{.mark} as "very important" and [68 percent flagged health
care]{.mark}.]{.underline} Voters accord even less importance to
specific foreign policy issues. [Pew reported that just 42 percent of
respondents said climate change was important to their vote, and it
didn't even bother to ask about terrorism.]{.underline}

Events could still elevate foreign policy in importance. There is no
shortage of simmering crises that could suddenly remind Americans of
their stake in what happens abroad. But for now, as unusual as 2020 has
been, it is shaping up as a pretty traditional election year in at least
one respect.

[When it comes to technology and the economy, **[the U.S. is grappling
with two contradictory goals]{.mark}: [competing with China in advanced
tech]{.mark}nology industries [and ramping up antitrust]{.mark}
enforcement against leading U.S. tech companies.**]{.underline}

Antimonopoly advocates argue that we can have our cake and eat it too.
Go ahead and break up big tech, they say; we can still compete with
China. But [there is [a long history of U.S. antitrust actions]{.mark}
against technology companies, and the results [suggest regulators should
exercise caution.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Consider the case of Western Electric, AT&T's equipment
subsidiary.]{.underline} By the early 1920s, it had factories in
Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Russia and the U.K. [But because AT&T relied on it
exclusively for equipment, in 1925 the Justice Department threatened
AT&T with breakup unless it divested Western Electric's foreign assets,
creating International Telephone & Telegraph and]{.underline} ultimately
[giving birth to robust foreign-owned competitors.]{.underline}

Antitrust regulators also pressured AT&T's Bell Labs in the early 1950s
to license its newly invented transistor technology. That spurred
innovation because it helped emerging companies such as Texas
Instruments and Fairchild. But [[because of gov]{.mark}ernment
[pressure, AT&T]{.mark} also [licensed its tech]{.mark}nology, almost
[for free, to foreign companies. **This eventually enabled Sony to take
global leadership from the U.S.**]{.mark} **in consumer electronics, and
it gave a major leg up to Europe's Ericsson and Siemens.**]{.underline}

[[The U.S. also used to be the global leader in television
tech]{.mark}nology thanks to the Radio Corp. of America]{.underline},
the pathbreaker in color television. **[[But]{.mark} in the 1950s [the
Justice Department required RCA to let other U.S. companies use its
patents at no charge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** RCA had long relied on
licensing revenue, so it started making money where it could---in Japan.
"RCA licenses made Japanese color television possible," technology
historian James Abegglen has written.

[In 1972, the Federal Trade Commission brought a similar antitrust suit
against Xerox]{.underline}, the world's then-leading producer of copier
technology thanks in part to its Silicon Valley-based innovation
incubator Xerox PARC. Evidently unimpressed, the head of the FTC's
Bureau of Competition F.M. Scherer said he would be "dissatisfied if
Xerox's market share isn't significantly diminished in several years."
To that end, the FTC forced Xerox to give up its blueprints and other
discoveries, allowing an estimated 1,700 patents to make their way to
Xerox competitors. Sure enough, Xerox lost half its market
share---mostly to Japanese firms such as Canon, Toshiba and Sharp.
Xerox's only viable path to survival was to strengthen its alliance with
Fuji, creating a new giant, Fuji Xerox.

[Two years later [in 1974, the Justice Department targeted AT&T
again]{.mark}]{.underline}, forcing it to break up over the objections
of Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge that the suit jeopardized
America's leadership position. **[[This was the death knell for Bell
Labs, arguably the most innovative organization that has ever
existed.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

None of this is to say that antitrust authorities should be passive or
turn a blind eye to anticompetitive behavior. But they should recognize
that firms' size can be an important factor in their ability to
innovate. Rather than rely on market share as the alarm bell that
signals the need for antitrust enforcement, regulators should focus more
on firms' conduct, and they should look first to behavioral remedies,
not structural ones**[. [Antitrust analysis should]{.mark} also
[consider]{.mark} that tech [companies compete globally]{.mark}, not
nationally, so cutting them down to size usually has significant
economic consequences.]{.underline}**

The Federal Communications Commission has provided a model for the
behavioral approach by conducting a series of inquiries starting in 1970
to investigate the convergence of telephone and computing services and
establish rules enabling competition among established and upstart
players across sectors that are increasingly intertwined. U.S. courts
also provided a model in judgments against Microsoft, which compelled it
to let other companies more easily integrate their software into
Windows.

**[As policy makers now consider competition issues related to today's
large technology firms, they would be well advised to learn from this
history. [With Chinese]{.mark} internet and [tech companies waiting in
the wings, aggressive antitrust actions against U.S. leaders run the
risk of]{.mark} giving [a new generation of foreign
rivals]{.mark}]{.underline}** the boost they need to dominate global
markets, just as Japanese and European firms have benefited in the past.

June 22.

[[Antitrust regulation]{.underline}]{.mark} began as a populist reaction
against big business and industrial concentration. Yet, it [**[has
proven ineffective at countering]{.mark} the perceive threat of
[big]{.mark}ness in [business, while causing considerable harm to
consumers, competition, ]{.mark}**[and **innovation**]{.mark}. Moreover,
many antitrust policies are based on faulty arguments that bear little
relation to how real-world markets work. And]{.underline} throughout its
history, U.S. antitrust law [has created considerable uncertainty for
businesses]{.underline}, as federal antitrust enforcers have tried
different regulatory approaches over the last 130 years.

The "rule of reason" standard, which had no set criteria, became the
standard for enforcing actions from fines to jail terms to firm
breakups. During the New Deal, government policy turned in the opposite
direction and actively encouraged cartel behavior. After a postwar
change of heart, antitrust enforcement reached its peak in the 1950s and
early 1960s. Around this time, economists' arguments slowly earned
mainstream acceptance in the legal profession. By the 1980s, a
Chicago-style consumer welfare had become the dominant enforcement
standard, and has remained so up to the present day. However, the
combination of a populist presidential administration with a growing
Neo-Brandeisian antitrust movement on the progressive side threaten to
revert antitrust policy to something closer to an arbitrary rule of
reason standard, which creates the potential for a sharp upswing in
enforcement actions against large or politically disfavored firms.

While [the Chicago school and the Neo-Brandeisians prefer different
levels of antitrust enforcement, both believe that antitrust regulation
is an effective tool for managing competitive market processes. **In
this, both are in error, for a number of reasons.**]{.underline}

First, **[[competition is a spectrum, not an on/off
switch]{.mark}.]{.underline}** That makes it difficult to set
predictable standards that companies can work to avoid violating and
plan around.

Second, [[**regulators are prone to fall for the relevant market**
fallacy]{.mark}, in which a company appears to dominate a narrowly
defined market but has little power in the larger market in which it
actually competes.]{.underline}

Third, **[[antitrust enforcement standards are]{.mark} so [broad]{.mark}
that they are useless as a guide to permissible behavior.]{.underline}**
Allowable behavior changes with the political winds. Cases, especially
major ones, are sometimes prosecuted for publicity rather than merit.

Fourth, [**[antitrust regulation creates rent-seeking
opportunities]{.mark} for companies seeking favors from government to
harm competitors**[. As a result]{.mark}, antitrust [regulation]{.mark},
as actually practiced, [has done far more to stifle competition than
to]{.mark} protect it or [promote it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Finally, **[antitrust regulation takes a short-term approach to a
long-term competitive process.]{.underline}** The IBM case was in play
for a dozen years before the government dropped the case. By that time,
the technology at the heart of the case had changed and IBM's
competitive position had declined. A case against one of the FAANG
companies would likely have similar competitive relevance by the time a
major trial would be decided.

As noted, [antitrust regulation harms competition, consumers, and
innovation, and therefore should be repealed.]{.underline} Congress
should repeal the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Act of 1914, and the
Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, as amended, including the
Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950 and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976. A
**[market-based approach to competition would enable more powerful
market regulation to replace flawed government
regulation.]{.underline}** This would reduce regulatory uncertainty and
its chilling effects on innovation, reduce rent-seeking, and do away
with the need for intellectual rabbit holes such as defining relevant
markets or permissible levels of firm size or market share.

[Aggressive antitrust enforcement can create considerable economic
uncertainty]{.underline}, which can have a chilling effect on long term
investment and innovation in both products and in business practices
that could benefit consumers. [[Consumers and competition would greatly
benefit from the repeal of antitrust regulations]{.mark} regarding
restraint of trade and monopolization, horizontal and vertical mergers,
collusion such as price fixing and market division, predatory pricing,
price discrimination, minimum resale prices, exclusive dealing, tying
and bundling, strategic predatory behavior, and technological
lock-in]{.underline}. As the economy becomes more high-tech,
specialized, and global**[, [antitrust policies formed in the smokestack
era are becoming progressively less relevant.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Does cyber warfare fall under the international humanitarian law (IHL)?
Jeffrey Kelsey holds that [IHL 'should evolve to encourage the use of
cyber warfare in some situations and provide states better guidance in
the conduct of these attacks']{.underline} \[16\]. He argues that for a
decade or more the 'potential threat and opportunity of cyber warfare'
have confronted military planners while the ['international community
has yet to reach consensus on the application of IHL']{.underline}. This
lack of consensus may be due to a variety of reasons, from holding that
the 'current IHL framework can be applied to cyber warfare by analogy'
to the realization that vast growth and fluidity of technology would
make potential international agreements obsolete \[16\]. Kelsey further
maintains that 'IHL applies to cyber warfare by analogy but contends
that IHL must evolve to accommodate and, in some cases even encourage
cyber warfare over conventional methods' \[16\].

The movement in a cyber attack across a neutral state becomes more than
a 'mere communication signal', for [cyber weapons can cause damage to
states as have more conventional weapons.]{.underline} A weapon the
'size of a electron' could be a violation of the territory of a neutral
state according to the Hague Convention that 'forbids the movement of
weapons' across a neutral state which risks being drawn into a wider
cyber conflict when its Internet nodes are engaged by a belligerent
\[16\]. What obligations would a neutral state have as a conduit for
cyber attack and mischief? Kelsey argues against establishing new
treaties and in favour of states and their military commanders to follow
established legal principles in cyber combat \[16\]. The question
remains: What standards should emerge for a cyber security regime under
established peace and war legal principles? Since cyber warfare is still
in its infancy, some would argue that regulating it is a difficult if
not an impossible challenge. [However, the so called catastrophic cyber
attack is to be avoided, it would be **foolish and impractical not to
establish some type of international rules** of the game as
deterrence.]{.underline}

3\. Towards a 21st Century Global Cyber Regime Thus far, the diplomatic
community has had little to say about the governance of cyber warfare.
Two exceptions of major importance include former diplomats with
knowledge of ICT have in recent months discussed with this author the
major international relations quandaries from cyber threats and attacks
plus their own concerns about diplomatic-level solutions. These former
envoys are retired senior US Amb. Thomas Pickering who served over four
decades in major posting for the US Dept of State, and Amb. David Gross,
U.S. Coordinator for International Communications and Information Policy
2001-08. The latter observes that diplomatic silence may be attributed
largely to a generational gap and a lack of technical understanding by
policy makers since the Internet and associated networks are fairly
recent developments; therefore, [cyber security concepts in
international affairs are still a nascent on the part of the diplomatic
community]{.underline} (Gross to the author: April 2009). With
wide-ranging diplomatic and corporate experience, Amb. Pickering sees an
even larger problem in that forming an international treaty involves
major, prolonged steps and major questions: What is the problem to be
solved? How will the problem evolve in the future? (Pickering to the
author: July 2009). Since cyber warfare is being conducted and developed
during a period of wide interstate trade and general economic accord or
agreement, there is an opportunity to design a governing framework
before an actual global catastrophic attack takes place. Today the
questions remains: Can governments be motivated to take action now
before it is too late?

Special regimes have been formed for far-ranging interests or
activities, such as treaties governing the Arctic, Antarctic, canals,
international rivers, and outer space. While somewhat vague or
undetermined there appears to be a consensus that outer space begins
where airspace ends \[17\]. Examples of the treaties governing outer
space include those governing the International Space Station (1998),
Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (1975), INTELSAT or
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (1986), INMARSAT
or International Maritime Satellite Organization (1976), as well as the
ITU or International Telecommunications Union (1932; 1947 as UN agency)
\[17\]. You may ask, 'Where does cyberspace begin?' It would appear that
cyberspace begins with the keystroke to log on to a cyber network,
whether from a mega terminal, a PC, a game console, or a mobile
telephone. Eventually, the ultimate venue for cyber warfare governance
would be The Hague as the home of the world's first Peace Conference and
for over a century as the international centre of justice and
arbitration, as well as warfare governance. The Hague hosts several
international organisations, including the UN International Court of
Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the NATO Consultation,
Command and Control Agency (NC3A). As cyber warfare moves to the
forefront of more government agendas, more questions arise as to how the
Law of Armed Conflict and the Geneva Convention apply to cyberspace.
Responses are likely to range on both sides of the fault line: those who
see cyber warfare as fitting neatly under existing LOAC (as well as
under the UN charter), and on the other side, those who see the need for
an entirely new set of international laws and treaties to govern cyber
warfare.

A Way Forward While it is unlikely that these two countervailing
diplomatic/legal views will be reconciled anytime soon, [the **time is
now to begin having this debate** in a more serious, focused
manner.]{.underline} Again, because cyber warfare is a complex and
dynamic issue, these debates will need to be hosted in many different
venues and viewed from many different perspectives. [NATO is already
playing an important role in this debate by hosting
conferences]{.underline} such as this June 2009 Tallinn gathering
bringing together the relevant players from both member states and
global partners. [For the foreseeable future, this **NATO Center of
Excellence can play a critical role** in bringing together the best
experts both to analyze and to debate the problems from a number of
unique cultural and disciplinary perspectives.]{.underline}

[As the world's premiere military alliance, **NATO is positioned to play
a major role by facilitating** **significant interstate dialogue**
between civilian and military planners. Each year NATO hosts various
fora where such engagements take place. The NATO Global Partnership
Program provides a mechanism to reach out to other
countries.]{.underline} NATO could also explore reaching out to other
peace and security alliances, such as ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), for the purpose of exploring
confidence-building measures with that global hemisphere. Although
presently cyber warfare/defense is largely an ungoverned affair, the UN
leadership has already acknowledged the severity of the problem and the
need for governance. UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon earlier this year
announced that the UN Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters is to
include cyber weapons in its arms list \[18\]. In his prepared February
remarks to this Advisory Board the Sec-Gen stated: This year you will be
considering cyber warfare and its impact on international security. As
you know, there have been many widely reported breaches of information
systems in recent years. With both the public and private sectors
growing increasingly dependent on electronic information, your work in
this area is very timely. It will also complement the efforts of the
panel of governmental experts that will be addressing information
security later this year \[19\].

The UN's International Telecommunications Union last year concluded its
agreement with the International Multilateral Partnership Against
Cyber-Terrorism (IMPACT) to conduct the ITU Global Cybersecurity Agenda
(GCA) with headquarters in Cyberjaya, Kuala Lumpur. The GCA seeks
international cooperation for governments, international law enforcement
authorities, the private sector, international organisations, and civil
society for the purpose of a secure cyberspace. Through five areas the
GCA if focused on strengthening the legal framework, technical measures,
organizational structure, capacity building, and international
cooperation. \[20\] At its Cyberjaya headquarters inauguration the
ITU-GCA was billed as 'public-private initiative' and a 'framework for
cooperation aimed at finding strategic solutions to boost confidence and
security' in a networked world \[21\].

Relevant committees beyond the UN should also begin to debate a proper a
framework for cyber warfare while other international fora can and
should play a role. Significant organisations such as the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Internet Society
(ISOC) are positioned to use their technical legitimacy and their soft
power to press forward with best practices for member states to follow
in securing their own sovereign cyberspace. World Trade Organization
(WTO) signatories should develop an agreement for pledges from nations
not to promote or solicit mercenaries, or attack a member state's trade
infrastructure. On the military side, the national leading military
services should be encouraged to act with transparency where possible so
as not to launch initiatives that unduly contribute to unnecessary cyber
arms race between states.

One of the most difficult governance areas to reconcile will be in the
area of police vs. military involvement in cyber security/defence. As
the US-led global war on terror has shown, there is no clear line of
authority when defending against threats where state involvement is
murky at best. Due to the anonymous and secretive nature of cyber
warfare, state involvement is often tricky for producing fool-proof
forensics that can prove state involvement. While each country will
ultimately need to sort through this problem in accordance to its
national laws and constitutions, more global debate will be needed to
clarify these issues.

Participants in Tallinn are witnesses to the positive leadership role
assumed by Estonia and leading to the NATO CCD COE here at the scene of
the first acknowledged, major interstate cyber conflict. There is
potential for a cyber treaty to emerge should the North Atlantic Council
embrace thoroughly the cyber warfare issue and engage the NATO
Consultation, Control and Command Agency (NC3A) and the NATO Military
Authorities (NMA). The Tallinn cyber convention questions and
discussions are a start, but a protocol or treaty governing the conduct
of cyber warfare needs serious consideration.

4\. Conclusion [While cyber warfare is not an entirely new area of
modern warfare]{.underline} (at least as viewed within an Internet
world[), its **current evolution poses many challenges to international
peace and stability**. The increasing quantity and quality of online
attacks threaten many parts of civil society that depend on reliable
networks and information systems]{.underline}. Growing evidence of
[state-sponsored cyber attacks is especially alarming and could spark a
**serious arms race in cyberspace**.]{.underline} Understandably, a
number of countries have announced plans for full spectrum military
cyber commands. As history has demonstrated, while [international
law]{.underline} cannot stop states from going to war with one another,
it [can go a long ways towards regulating their conduct should
hostilities boil over into actual war.]{.underline} Some may argue that
because cyber warfare is still in its formative stages, it is premature
to begin work on a global regime to regulate it. However, it can also be
logically argued that [absence of some rules of the game, states will
not feel constrained to develop and deploy cyber weaponry if the
consequences are not understood by both military and civilian
planners.]{.underline} While it is difficult to estimate the [true
potential for a catastrophic attack to spill over to kinetic warfare
between states, the notion that the threat exists at all is cause enough
to begin constructing a regime or **legal framework through which to
conduct cyber warfare**.]{.underline}

History presents another lesson in that even with the best intentions
and resources, a global cyber security regime will not transpire in
short order. It will take many years to form an effective international
consensus that might translate into a revision of the Law of Armed
Conflict as spelled out by the Geneva Conventions. The operative concept
is regime. And, [the time to establish a global cyber security regime is
now.]{.underline} As a proper follow-up to the innovative inaugural
Tallinn CCD COE conference of 2009, [**NATO can and should play an
important role by bringing together in short order** the relevant
stakeholders to outline **a viable cyber security regime.**]{.underline}

years ago properly challenge the legal community, and this writer has
chosen to extend his challenges to the wider global policy community.
