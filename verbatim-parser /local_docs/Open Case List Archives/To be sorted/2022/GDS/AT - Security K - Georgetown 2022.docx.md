approach to ethical critique in CDA," Critical Discourse Studies Volume
15, 2018 - Issue 2, 169-185) \[CDA=critical discourse analysis\]

The term 'discourse ethics' is Habermas's (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012:
30-34), but we are using it here in a general sense: for the view that
[an **adequate [framework for ethical evaluation]{.mark}** and
**critique [must include]{.mark} the comparison** and **evaluation of
different [arguments for]{.mark} different lines of [action]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}in a process of deliberation]{.underline}. Such assessments of
arguments pose difficult problems, and deliberation is by no means
guaranteed to produce consensus. Nevertheless, [[deliberation can
**contribute to** ]{.mark}**the quality of ethical [critique]{.mark}**
[by ensuring]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} **wide [range of arguments are
considered]{.mark}** in making decisions, that all alternatives are
**taken into account** and **thoroughly criticized**, and that people
have to (at least) **moderate their own partialities** in evaluating a
range of arguments collectively]{.underline}. To illustrate this, we
shall refer to two ethically contentious political decisions and the
courses of action which they led to. The first is the decision by the
British Prime Minister Tony Blair to advocate Britain's participation in
the invasion of Iraq in 2003 (we have discussed this in Fairclough &
Fairclough 2012: 96-97). The second is the decision by the German
Chancellor Angela Merkel to open Germany's borders to the refugees
coming from the Middle East in the autumn of 2015. In so doing, we will
illustrate the relevance of ethical critique from all three of the major
ethical positions: deontological, consequentialist and virtue ethics.
CDA and practical argumentation CDA is mainly concerned with [critical
analysis of discourse]{.underline} which [is **oriented to
action**]{.underline}, including political discourse, but also
managerial, organisational and other forms of discourse. [The **primary
activity** in such discourse is **practical
argumentation**]{.underline}, argumentation over action, [over **[what
is to be done]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. **[[what policies should be
adopted]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [Practical argumentation
should]{.underline} accordingly [be the **primary analytical
focus**]{.underline} in CDA (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012). [This
**[does not exclude other]{.mark}**]{.underline} familiar **[forms of
analysis]{.underline}** ([such as **[analysing
rep]{.mark}resentation[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}[) [but subsumes
them.]{.underline} ]{.mark}[The point of]{.underline} representing (or
['framing']{.underline}) [an issue in a particular way is to **create
particular**]{.underline} public [**attitudes** and **opinions**, and
thus **legitimize** or **facilitate a particular course of
action**.]{.underline} Critique of discourse is the focal concern for
CDA, but critique of discourse is by no means exclusive to CDA. On the
contrary, [critique of discourse]{.underline} is a normal part of all
discourse. It [is a **normal part of everyday practical argumentation**:
people **find reasons in favour** and **against proposals for action**,
they **consider alternatives**, **adopt them** or **discard them**, and
so on[. A course of action **worthy of being adopted** is **one that has
withstood criticism**]{.mark}. Agents may decide to discard proposals
either because they are **likely to be instrumentally inadequate** iun
relation to the goals they are supposed to achieve, or because they find
them **ethically problematic**]{.underline}, for example because the
values or goals they are motivated by are unacceptable. Ethical critique
is a concern for CDA at three levels: as an aspect of agents' reasoning,
for example as an aspect of politicians' deliberation over what policy
to adopt; as an aspect of the normative critique of those deliberative
practices which CDA carries out; as an aspect of the critique that CDA
itself is open to. There are therefore three main places where ethical
values come into the picture: what values are arguers (e.g. politicians)
arguing from? what are the values that CDA analysts are espousing, from
the perspective of which they are evaluating the arguments of those
arguers? what are the values of other critics (including critics of
CDA)? [CDA]{.underline} is itself a form of discourse, which is
specialized for academic critique of social actions, events, practices
and structures, with a focus on discourse. It [can itself be viewed as a
**form of practical argumentation**]{.underline} (Fairclough 2013),
[open to the **same critical questions** that it directs at the
discourse it subjects to critique]{.underline}. CDA practitioners are
bound by an obligation to address ethical evaluations that are critical
of their work. Moreover, [the ethical judgement which is part of the
normative critique carried out]{.underline} in CDA [**does not come out
of thin air**, but is built upon elements drawn selectively from ethical
judgement and critique in public discourse]{.underline}. And CDA needs
to rethink its own critique in response to shifts in public discourse
and political reality, such as the emergence of controversy over
'political correctness' (Fairclough 2003). We have argued that [[the
**primary focus** of critical analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} in CDA
[[should b]{.mark}e **practical argumentation** and
**deliberation**]{.underline} (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012). This was
based upon a claim about the character of political discourse, which we
saw as [primarily [concerned with ]{.mark}]{.underline}the question of
[**[what is to be done]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Deliberation is an
abstract genre in which **(alternative) proposals are being tested**.
The **framework**]{.underline} for critical analysis [of **practical
argumentation** and **deliberation**]{.underline} which we have
developed since 2012 [provides]{.underline} CDA with [an **effective way
of evaluating** and **critiquing discourse** from an **ethical point of
view**]{.underline}. One of its strengths is that [it allows **different
approaches** to thinking about ethical questions]{.underline}
(deontological, consequentialist and virtue ethics) [to be combined
within an **ethical deliberative procedure for achieving
impartiality**]{.underline}. In a more recent version of this framework
(Fairclough, I. 2016, 2018), [deliberation is modelled as a critical
procedure designed to **filter out**]{.underline} those **[practical
conclusions]{.underline}** (and corresponding decisions) [that **would
not pass the test of critical questioning**]{.underline}. Two distinct
argument schemes are involved in deliberative activity types: an
argument from goals, circumstances and meansgoal relations, and an
argument from (negative or positive) consequences. [[Proposals
are]{.mark} **tentatively supported** by **practical arguments from
goals**, and are **[tested in the light of their potential
consequences]{.mark}**, via **practical arguments from
consequence**]{.underline}. Goals are generated by various sources of
normativity, and these can be what conventionally is called 'values',
but can also be obligations, rights and duties. [Critical questioning
seeks to **expose potential negative consequences** of proposals and
thus evaluate them in terms of their **acceptability** or
**reasonableness**: if the consequences are **on balance unacceptable**
for those affected, then it would be **more reasonable not to engage in
the proposed course of action**. Unacceptable consequences are
**critical objections** which can **conclusively rebut a proposal**.
Where two or more proposals survive critical testing, one may be
**chosen as the better proposal** on nonarbitrary grounds]{.underline}
(e.g. being simpler to enact). In our view, [the **most significant
perspective** in the light of which proposals are to be tested is a
**consequentialist** one]{.underline} (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012,
Fairclough, I. 2016). The term 'consequence' is however used here
broadly to refer to several types of states-of-affairs: the goals of the
proposed action (the intended consequences); the potential unintended
consequences (or risks) involved; various known and predictable impacts,
including impacts on institutional, social facts. [If a proposal is
**likely to result in a situation** that is]{.underline} illegal or
[**unjust**, then the proposal can be **evaluated as unacceptable** from
both a **consequentialist ethics** and a **deontological ethical
position**. [Our framework can]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore
**[[accommodate]{.underline}]{.mark}** deontological [[**ethical
issues** within a]{.mark}]{.underline} broader **[[consequentialist
perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By inquiring into the motives of
action, the framework can also accommodate a virtue-ethical perspective.

theories]{.underline} while making research policy-relevant**

Added-**[value of [scenario analysis for IR
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As Tomé and Açıkalın (2019) point out, in order [to [**fill the gap**
between]{.mark} **IR [theory]{.mark}** [and **real**]{.mark}**-world
[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, "an increasing number of
[[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} have come to [[embrace]{.mark} a spirit
of [**intellectual openness**, recognizing]{.mark} both the need for
[**greater flexibility** in]{.mark} the [**theoretical formulations**
and]{.mark} the [**possibility of complementarity** by **other
theories**]{.mark} and approaches"]{.underline} (p. 12).
[This]{.underline} section discusses the [added value of scenario
analysis as a **complementary approach** to **traditional IR
methods**.]{.underline} The [most obvious [advantage of **scenario
analysis**]{.mark} **as a methodology**]{.underline}, grounded in the
reservoir of foresight studies, [[lies]{.underline}]{.mark} by
definition [[in its ability to **tackle future
events**.]{.underline}]{.mark} As mentioned before, [there are no
specified instruments within traditional IR methods which would allow
scholars to go beyond past and present.]{.underline} The only exception
is forecasting, one of the formal methods in IR, which is, however,
distinctly different from foresight.

The underlying logic of forecasting is to provide predictions about the
future by drawing on mathematical models and big data-sets based on
known patterns. Thus, it is not particularly suitable to accommodate
discontinuities. Foresight, as described above, aims at going beyond
existing patterns by developing alternative futures based on an
innovative combination of multiple driving forces. Its goal is to
capture a set of possible futures and learn from them by examining the
causal relations between driving forces and their different evolutions.
By applying scenario approaches, scholars can thus account for evolving
dynamics and discuss such timely issues as the consequences of Brexit
for both British and EU-security, economics and politics (Brakman,
Garretsen, & Kohl, 2018; Martill & Sus, 2018; Musolff, 2017;
Verschueren, 2017; Ziv et al., 2018). Yet, [scenario analysis offers
more than the possibility to talk about the future.]{.underline} We see
a fourfold merit of adding scenario analysis to the range of methods
applied by IR scholars.

Confronting enduring assumptions

As we presented in the previous section, the main feature of
[explorative scenarios]{.underline}, which are the subject of this
paper, is to [**stimulate creative thinking** by **challenging** the
**deeply held assumptions of their authors**.]{.underline} In other
words, [[this method]{.mark} is helpful for **[overcom]{.mark}ing**
enduring **[cognitive biases]{.mark}**---mental errors [such as
**linearity**]{.mark}, **presentism**, [and **group think** caused by
the **subconscious**]{.mark} and **simplified information processing of
humans**]{.underline} (Heuer, 1999, pp. 111-- 112). [Humans have the
tendencies to focus on the present at the expense of the future and to
think about the future in linear terms by extrapolating past trends into
the future.]{.underline} As Gaddis (1992) points out, "we tend to bias
our historical and our theoretical analyses too much toward continuity
(...) [we rarely]{.underline} find a way to [introduce **discontinuities
into theory**]{.underline}, [or to attempt to determine what causes them
to happen]{.underline}" (p. 52). Even if Gaddis does not explicitly
mention scenarios, he refers to the concepts underlying scenario
approaches (Han, 2011, p. 51). [Scenario analysis attends to
"**deeper**, otherwise left **implicit**, **assumptions** about
**continuous** and **linear patterns of development**"]{.underline}
(Wilkinson et al., 2013, p. 707). The [**[process]{.mark} of scenario
development** [invites]{.mark} the [participants to **reveal** and
**question convictions** which]{.mark} have **so far [remained
unchallenged]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} to **[question]{.mark} the
[linearity of]{.mark} world
[developments]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [ability of **reexamining one's own assumptions** and going **beyond
linear patterns** of development is **essential** for **IR
scholarship**.]{.underline} To illustrate it with two examples: IR
scholars and historians did not think that the Soviet Union could
collapse and were startled by its fall, the peaceful resolution of the
Cold War and the transformation of the bipolar system (Davis, 2005;
Gaddis, 1992). In a similar vein, United States scholars were for
decades so convinced of China's economic, political, and cultural
limitations that they neglected the possibility of its sudden ascent and
were taken by surprise when it happened (Hundley, Kenzer, & Peterson,
2015). Interestingly, since the rise of China became evident, the United
States debate on its future has been marked by a similar linearity of
thought, leading to single-outcome predictions of China's long-term
future (Kerbel, 2004). In both cases, the discipline proved incapable of
anticipating events of such importance, because scholars took for
granted the status quo instead of confronting their bias towards
linearity and detect manifestations of upcoming change. As a result, two
major geopolitical surprises---the end of the Cold War and the rise of
China have at first been neglected, forcing academia to catch up.

Against this backdrop, [[foresight helps]{.mark} IR [scholars]{.mark} to
**[exit]{.mark}** the [**tunnel vision** on]{.mark} world
[affairs]{.mark} and discover potentially valuable nonlinear lines of
development. [These can be]{.mark} both [**innovative** in]{.mark} terms
of [**scholarship**, and **policy-relevant**]{.mark} by [offering a
**reflection**]{.mark} on **unexpected discontinuities**.]{.underline}
Thus, [it can facilitate the **intellectual capability** [to **think the
unthinkable**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Porter, 2016, p. 259).

Bringing forward new research questions

[Scenario analysis starts with **confronting one's enduring
assumptions** and **developing multiple causal possibilities**, through
which scholars can potentially discover topics that have not been
examined before. One of the greatest challenges for any scholar is to
identify innovative venues for research that might bring the discipline
forward]{.underline} and advance publicity for one's work. In Lakatosian
terms, such an ability is often considered an evidence of a progressive
research program.10 [Since the prime feature of scenario analysis is to
**detect rapid and significant shifts** in **trajectories**, or the
**forces behind them**, this method succors]{.underline} when defining
new pressing topics for academia. In particular, as mentioned in the
previous section, scenario analysis enables the detection of both weak
signals and wild cards. By drawing attention to these hitherto
overlooked but potentially pressing issues, [scenario analysis can
identify research agendas for **further investigation**]{.underline}
(Barma et al., 2016). Therefore, [scenario analysis seems to be the
right tool to **advance innovative research** since it helps scholars
**drive their research into new areas**, away from moribund topics that
have been followed for many decades.]{.underline} By "identifying
questions of likely future significance" (Barma et al., 2016, p. 6),
scenario analysis can contribute to combatting the proliferation of
researchers in fields occupying the political status quo, such as Soviet
or Japan studies in the United States in the 1980s. At the same time,
[[innovative research]{.mark} topics **[confront]{.mark} the
[uncertainties]{.mark}** [that are **crucial for policymakers**
to]{.mark} be [monitor]{.mark}ed closely.]{.underline}

Dealing with the complexity and interdisciplinarity of real-world issues

[Another added value of the scenario analysis for IR scholarship lies in
its ability to provide **comprehensive causal reasoning** and thus to
**tackle complex issues**.]{.underline} As mentioned in the
introduction, [the **world's complexity** combined with **abrupt
shifts** poses a challenge for IR scholarship.]{.underline} The
[[possibility to **accommodate multiple driving forces**, to **take into
account different values**]{.mark} they might take [and]{.mark} finally
to **[combine them]{.mark} with each other** [and **see how they affect
the**]{.mark} **dependent [variable]{.mark}**, [makes]{.mark} the
[scenario approach]{.mark} quite [unique]{.mark}. Traditional IR methods
work with a limited number of independent variables]{.underline},
formulate and test hypotheses usually based on the relation between a
single causal variable and the dependent variable. Investigating complex
causal trajectories is therefore not possible. Against this background,
we agree with Barma et al. (2016) and his colleagues who argue that
[**scenarios are highly apt** for **dealing with complexity** and
**uncertainty** and [providing]{.mark} academia with [a tool for
"**actionable clarity** in **understanding**]{.mark} **contemporary
global [issues]{.mark}**["]{.mark}]{.underline} (p. 1).

Moreover, the scenario approach helps to tackle the challenges of
interdisciplinarity that is tied to complexity. By drawing on the active
participation of people from different disciplines, backgrounds, and
with different expertise in the scenario development process, it brings
interdisciplinarity to the table by default. The key advantage of the
approach is that this [interdisciplinary conversation takes place prior
to and during the research phase, rather than after it.]{.underline}
This distinguishes the scenario approach from other methods that bring
interdisciplinary perspectives together but do not facilitate a
discussion between them, rather letting them passively co-exist. By
exploring the dynamics between seemingly unrelated vectors of change
(key drivers), [scenario analysis can be useful for shedding light on
developments that would have been overlooked by narrower research
designs. In **security studies**]{.underline}, for example, [scenario
analysis can **connect the dots** between hard, soft, traditional and
non-traditional understandings of security and capture the **interplay
of economic-societalenvironmental** and **technological changes**.
Imposing interdisciplinarity]{.underline} also [helps to **counter** the
"**hyper-fragmentation of knowledge**" that "makes it difficult for even
scholars in different disciplines to understand each other, much less
policy-makers and general public"]{.underline} (Desch, 2015, p. 381).

[Complex real-world issues]{.underline} that were [tackled using
scenario analysis include the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}
(Stein et al., 1998), [Turkey's geopolitical environment]{.underline}
(Çelik & Blum, 2007), the [prospects of the United States-- China
conflict]{.underline} (Friedberg, 2005) [and the consequences of Brexit
for EU foreign and security policy]{.underline} (Martill & Sus, 2018).
An examination of these topics without the application of
interdisciplinary approaches would not be possible precisely due to
their multifaceted character.

Stepping out of the ivory tower

Finally, [scenario analysis]{.underline} also [enables **IR scholars**
to **establish** a **channel of communication with
policy-makers**]{.underline} other than conducting interviews for their
own research or providing ad-hoc consultations. [A participatory
scenario process forges "**deep and shared understanding** between its
participants"]{.underline} (Ramírez & Wilkinson, 2016, p. 21). In
scenario workshops, [academics and policy-makers work together, confront
their world visions and assumptions and arrive at an agreement upon
which they develop narratives for alternative futures.]{.underline}
Hence, [[scenario analysis can be]{.mark} perceived as [a tool towards
**more exchange between academia and policy-making** that]{.mark} can
[contribute to a **better understanding between the two**]{.mark}
worlds. For policymakers, it provides the opportunity [to consider
**long-term trends**]{.mark}]{.underline} (an occasion not often found
in the day-to-day nature of politics). [For academics, it provides
insight into which trends are most concerning for policy-makers,
allowing them to check [and]{.mark} ultimately [enhance]{.mark} the
**[relevance of]{.mark} their [research
agendas]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We acknowledge the difficulty to engage policy-makers in foresight
exercises caused by their time-constrains and possible lack of interest.
Yet, in our experience, this problem mostly refers to high-level
policy-makers. Mid-level and former officials and policy-makers have
more time and willingness to participate in foresight exercises and
contribute equally valuable perspectives. The participatory character of
foresight exercises facilitates the exchange of views from different
stakeholders on an equal level. In our case, as the evaluation has
shown, it has proven to be stimulating for each of the engaged groups.

Moreover, the [**policy dialogue** benefits from **scenarios'
accessibility** to a **broader audience**. Scenario publications tend to
be shorter and easier to read than the average academic
publication]{.underline} and as Nye (2008) rightly notes "a premium on
time is a major difference between the two cultures" of academia and
policy-making. Since [scenario publications are **more suitable** to the
**time- and attention-constraints** of many policy-makers, they improve
the accessibility of research findings for the policy world]{.underline}
(Cairney & Kwiatkowski, 2017). An illustrative example is offered by a
foresight exercise conducted by the Aspen Institute Berlin in 2017. A
group of academics, think tank experts and policy-makers developed
scenarios on the future of the liberal world order that served as raw
material for a newspaper from the future titled "The Aspen Insight" and
dated October 21, 2025. Not only did the presentation of the newspaper
catch the attention of many Berlin-based policy-makers but the "The
Aspen Insight" was also attached as a supplement to the Berlin daily
Tagesspiegel, and reached more than 300,000 readers.11

We acknowledge that the four aspects of the added value of [scenario
analysis for IR scholarship]{.underline} are interrelated and that their
boundaries are not clear-cut. Yet, we believe, they [highlight distinct
benefits]{.underline} of this approach [for academics that want to
**tackle the challenges of today's world via their
research**.]{.underline}

**Scenario analysis is pedagogically valuable -- enhances creativity and
self-reflexivity, deconstructs cognitive biases and flawed ontological
assumptions, and enables the imagination and creation of alternative
futures.**

[Over the past decade, [the "cult of irrelevance"]{.mark} in political
science]{.underline} scholarship [[has been lamented by a growing
chorus]{.underline}]{.mark} (Putnam 2003; Nye 2009; Walt 2009).
[[Prominent scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} of international affairs
[[have diagnosed]{.underline}]{.mark} the roots of [[the
gap]{.underline}]{.mark} between academia and policymaking, [[made the
case for why]{.underline}]{.mark} political science [[research is
valuable for policymaking]{.underline}, [and
offered]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of [ideas]{.underline} for
enhancing the policy relevance of scholarship in international relations
and comparative politics (Walt 2005,2011; Mead 2010; Van Evera 2010;
Jentleson and Ratner 2011; Gallucci 2012; Avey and Desch 2014). Building
on these insights, [[several initiatives]{.mark} have been
formed]{.underline} in the attempt to "bridge the gap."2
[Many]{.underline} of the specific efforts put in place by these
projects [focus on providing scholars with the skills, platforms, and
networks to better communicate]{.underline} the [findings and
implications]{.underline} of their research [to the policymaking
community]{.underline}, a necessary and worthwhile objective for a field
in which theoretical debates, methodological training, and publishing
norms tend more and more toward the abstract and esoteric.¶ [[Yet
enhancing communication]{.underline}]{.mark} between scholars and
policymakers [[is only one component]{.underline}]{.mark} of bridging
the gap between international affairs theory and practice.
[[Anothe]{.mark}r]{.underline} crucial component of this bridge [[is the
**generation of substantive research programs that are actually policy
relevant**]{.underline}]{.mark}---a challenge to which less concerted
attention has been paid. The dual challenges of bridging the gap are
especially acute for graduate students, a particular irony since many
enter the discipline with the explicit hope of informing policy. [In a
field that has an admirable devotion to pedagogical
self-reflection]{.underline}, [**[strikingly little attention is paid to
techniques for generating policy-relevant ideas]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[for]{.underline} dissertation and other [research topics]{.underline}.
Although numerous articles and conference workshops are devoted to the
importance of experiential and problem-based learning, especially
through techniques of simulation that emulate policymaking processes
(Loggins 2009; Butcher 2012; Glasgow 2012; Rothman 2012; DiCicco 2014),
little has been written about the use of such techniques for generating
and developing innovative research ideas.¶ [This article outlines an
experiential and problem-based approach to]{.underline} developing a
[political science research]{.underline} program [using scenario
analysis]{.underline}. It focuses especially on illuminating the
research generation and pedagogical benefits of this technique by
describing the use of scenarios in the annual New Era Foreign Policy
Conference (NEFPC), which brings together doctoral students of
international and comparative affairs who share a demonstrated interest
in policy-relevant scholarship.3 In the introductory section, the
article outlines the practice of scenario analysis and considers the
utility of the technique in political science. We argue that scenario
analysis should be viewed as a tool to stimulate problem-based learning
for doctoral students and discuss the broader scholarly benefits of
using scenarios to help generate research ideas. The second section
details the manner in which NEFPC deploys scenario analysis. The third
section reflects upon some of the concrete scholarly benefits that have
been realized from the scenario format. The fourth section offers
insights on the pedagogical potential associated with using scenarios in
the classroom across levels of study. A brief conclusion reflects on the
importance of developing specific techniques to aid those who wish to
generate political science scholarship of relevance to the policy
world.¶ What Are Scenarios and Why Use Them in Political Science?¶
[Scenario analysis]{.underline} is perceived most commonly as a
technique for examining the robustness of strategy. It [can immerse
decision makers in future states that go beyond conventional
extrapolations of current trends]{.underline}, [preparing them to take
advantage of unexpected opportunities and to protect themselves from
adverse exogenous shocks]{.underline}. The global petroleum company
Shell, a pioneer of the technique, characterizes scenario analysis as
the art of considering "what if" questions about possible future worlds.
[[Scenario analysis is]{.mark} thus **[typically seen as serving the
purposes of corporate planning or as a policy
tool]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}to be used in combination with
simulations of decision making. **[Yet scenario analysis [is not
inherently limited to these uses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This
section]{.underline} provides a brief overview of the practice of
scenario analysis and the motivations underpinning its uses. It then
[makes a case for the utility of the technique for political science
scholarship]{.underline} and describes how the scenarios deployed at
NEFPC were created.¶ The Art of Scenario Analysis¶ [We characterize
[scenario analysis]{.mark} as [the art of juxtaposing current trends in
unexpected combinations in order to **articulate surprising and yet
plausible futures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, often **[referred to as
"alternative worlds."]{.underline}** [[Scenarios
a]{.mark}re]{.underline} thus **[explicitly not forecasts or projections
based on linear extrapolations of contemporary patterns]{.underline}**,
[and they are **[not hypothesis-based expert
predictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Nor should they be equated with
simulation]{.underline}**]{.mark}[**s**, which are]{.underline} best
characterized as [functional representations of **real institutions** or
decision-making processes]{.underline} (Asal 2005). **[Instead, [they
are depictions of possible future states of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**, offered **[together with a narrative of
the driving causal forces]{.underline}** and potential exogenous shocks
**[that could lead to those futures]{.underline}**. Good scenarios thus
rely on explicit causal propositions that, independent of one another,
are plausible---yet, when combined, suggest surprising and sometimes
controversial future worlds. For example, few predicted the dramatic
fall in oil prices toward the end of 2014. Yet independent driving
forces, such as the shale gas revolution in the United States, China's
slowing economic growth, and declining conflict in major Middle Eastern
oil producers such as Libya, were all recognized secular trends
that---combined with OPEC's decision not to take concerted action as
prices began to decline---came together in an unexpected way.¶ While
scenario analysis played a role in war gaming and strategic planning
during the Cold War, the real antecedents of the contemporary practice
are found in corporate futures studies of the late 1960s and early 1970s
(Raskin et al. 2005). Scenario analysis was essentially initiated at
Royal Dutch Shell in 1965, with the realization that the usual
forecasting techniques and models were not capturing the rapidly
changing environment in which the company operated (Wack 1985; Schwartz
1991). In particular, it had become evident that straight-line
extrapolations of past global trends were inadequate for anticipating
the evolving business environment. Shell-style scenario planning "helped
break the habit, ingrained in most corporate planning, of assuming that
the future will look much like the present" (Wilkinson and Kupers 2013,
4). Using scenario thinking, Shell anticipated the possibility of two
Arab-induced oil shocks in the 1970s and hence was able to position
itself for major disruptions in the global petroleum sector.¶ Building
on its corporate roots, scenario analysis has become a standard
policymaking tool. For example, the Project on Forward Engagement
advocates linking systematic foresight, which it defines as the
disciplined analysis of alternative futures, to planning and feedback
loops to better equip the United States to meet contemporary governance
challenges (Fuerth 2011). Another prominent application of scenario
thinking is found in the National Intelligence Council's series of
Global Trends reports, issued every four years to aid policymakers in
anticipating and planning for future challenges. These reports present a
handful of "alternative worlds" approximately twenty years into the
future, carefully constructed on the basis of emerging global trends,
risks, and opportunities, and intended to stimulate thinking about
geopolitical change and its effects.4 As with corporate scenario
analysis, the technique can be used in foreign policymaking for
long-range general planning purposes as well as for anticipating and
coping with more narrow and immediate challenges. An example of the
latter is the German Marshall Fund's EuroFutures project, which uses
four scenarios to map the potential consequences of the Euro-area
financial crisis (German Marshall Fund 2013).¶ [[Several features make
scenario analysis particularly useful for
policymak]{.mark}ing]{.underline}.5 [Long-term global trends across a
number of different realms]{.underline}---social, technological,
environmental, economic, and political---[combine in often-unexpected
ways to produce unforeseen challenges]{.underline}. [Yet [the ability of
decision makers to imagine, let alone prepare for,
discontinuities]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in the policy realm [[is
constrained by their existing mental models and
maps]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This limitation is [exacerbated by]{.mark}
**well-known cognitive bias tendencies such as [groupthink and
confirmation bias]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}(Jervis 1976; Janis
1982; Tetlock 2005). [[The power of scenarios lies in their ability to
help individuals **break out of conventional modes of thinking**]{.mark}
and analysis by introducing unusual combinations of trends and
deliberate discontinuities in narratives about the future]{.underline}.
**[Imagining alternative future worlds through a structured analytical
process enables policymakers to envision and thereby adapt to something
altogether different from the known present]{.underline}**.¶ Designing
Scenarios for Political Science Inquiry¶ The characteristics of scenario
analysis that commend its use to policymakers also make it well suited
to helping political scientists generate and develop policy-relevant
research programs. [Scenarios are essentially textured, plausible, and
relevant stories that help us imagine how the future]{.underline}
political-economic world [could be different from the past]{.underline}
in a manner that highlights policy challenges and opportunities. For
example, terrorist organizations are a known threat that have captured
the attention of the policy community, yet our responses to them tend to
be linear and reactive. Scenarios that explore how seemingly unrelated
vectors of change---the rise of a new peer competitor in the East that
diverts strategic attention, volatile commodity prices that empower and
disempower various state and nonstate actors in surprising ways, and the
destabilizing effects of climate change or infectious disease
pandemics---can be useful for illuminating the nature and limits of the
terrorist threat in ways that may be missed by a narrower focus on
recognized states and groups. By illuminating the potential strategic
significance of specific and yet poorly understood opportunities and
threats, scenario analysis helps to identify crucial gaps in our
collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends and
dynamics. The notion of "exogeneity"---so prevalent in social science
scholarship---applies to models of reality, not to reality itself. [Very
simply, scenario analysis can throw into sharp relief often-overlooked
yet pressing questions in international affairs that demand focused
investigation]{.underline}.¶ [Scenarios thus offer]{.underline}, in
principle, [an innovative tool for developing a political science
research agenda]{.underline}. In practice, [achieving this objective
requires careful tailoring of the approach]{.underline}. The specific
scenario analysis technique we outline below was designed and refined to
provide a structured experiential process for generating problem-based
research questions with contemporary international policy relevance.6
The first step in the process of creating the scenario set described
here was to identify important causal forces in contemporary global
affairs. Consensus was not the goal; on the contrary, some of these
causal statements represented competing theories about global change
(e.g., a resurgence of the nation-state vs. border-evading globalizing
forces). A major principle underpinning the transformation of these
causal drivers into possible future worlds was to "simplify, then
exaggerate" them, before fleshing out the emerging story with more
details.7 Thus, the contours of the future world were drawn first in the
scenario, with details about the possible pathways to that point filled
in second. It is entirely possible, indeed probable, that some of the
causal claims that turned into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so
much as to be implausible, and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our
own form of groupthink went into construction of the scenarios. One of
the great strengths of scenario analysis, however, is that the scenario
discussions themselves, as described below, lay bare these especially
implausible claims and systematic biases.8¶ An explicit methodological
approach underlies the written scenarios themselves as well as the
analytical process around them---that of case-centered, structured,
focused comparison, intended especially to shed light on new causal
mechanisms (George and Bennett 2005). [The use of scenarios is similar
to counterfactual analysis in that it modifies certain variables in a
given situation in order to analyze the resulting effects]{.underline}
(Fearon 1991). [Whereas counterfactuals are traditionally
retrospective]{.underline} in nature and explore events that did not
actually occur in the context of known history, our [**[scenarios are
deliberately forward-looking]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
are [designed to **explore potential futures**]{.underline} that could
unfold. As such, counterfactual analysis is especially well suited to
identifying how individual events might expand or shift the "funnel of
choices" available to political actors and thus lead to different
historical outcomes (Nye 2005, 68--69), while forward-looking scenario
analysis can better illuminate surprising intersections and
sociopolitical dynamics without the perceptual constraints imposed by
fine-grained historical knowledge. [We see scenarios as a complementary
resource for exploring these dynamics in international affairs, rather
than as a replacement]{.underline} for counterfactual analysis,
historical case studies, or other methodological tools.¶ In the scenario
process developed for NEFPC, three distinct scenarios are employed,
acting as cases for analytical comparison. Each scenario, as detailed
below, includes a set of explicit "driving forces" which represent
hypotheses about causal mechanisms worth investigating in evolving
international affairs. The scenario analysis process itself employs
templates (discussed further below) to serve as a graphical
representation of a structured, focused investigation and thereby as the
research tool for conducting case-centered comparative analysis (George
and Bennett 2005). In essence, these templates articulate key observable
implications within the alternative worlds of the scenarios and serve as
a framework for capturing the data that emerge (King, Keohane, and Verba
1994). Finally, this structured, focused comparison serves as the basis
for the cross-case session emerging from the scenario analysis that
leads directly to the articulation of new research agendas.¶ [The
scenario process described here has thus been carefully designed to
offer some guidance to policy-oriented]{.underline} graduate [students
who are otherwise left to the relatively unstructured norms by which
political science]{.underline} dissertation [ideas are typically
developed]{.underline}. The initial articulation of a dissertation
project is generally an idiosyncratic and personal undertaking (Useem
1997; Rothman 2008), whereby students might choose topics based on their
coursework, their own previous policy exposure, or the topics studied by
their advisors. Research agendas are thus typically developed by looking
for "puzzles" in existing research programs (Kuhn 1996). Doctoral
students also, understandably, often choose topics that are particularly
amenable to garnering research funding. Conventional grant programs
typically base their funding priorities on extrapolations from what has
been important in the recent past---leading to, for example, the
prevalence of Japan and Soviet studies in the mid-1980s or terrorism
studies in the 2000s---in the absence of any alternative method for
identifying questions of likely future significance.¶ [The scenario
approach to generating research ideas is grounded in the belief that
these traditional approaches can be complemented by identifying
questions likely to be of great empirical importance in the real world,
even if these **do not appear**]{.underline} as puzzles [**in existing
research programs** or as clear extrapolations from past
events]{.underline}. The [[scenario]{.mark}s]{.underline} analyzed at
NEFPC [envision alternative worlds that could develop in the medium
(five to seven year) term and are designed to **[tease out issues
scholars and policymakers may encounter in the relatively near
future]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[so that they can **begin thinking
critically about them now**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [This timeframe offers
a period distant enough from the present as to avoid falling into
current events analysis, but not so far into the future as to seem like
science fiction]{.underline}. In imagining the worlds in which these
scenarios might come to pass, [[participants **learn strategies for
avoiding failures of creativity** and for **overturning the assumptions
that prevent scholars and analysts from anticipating and understanding**
the pivotal junctures that arise in international
affairs]{.underline}.]{.mark}

**nuclear [warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a circumstance that has never
resulted, but has captivated generations of political scientists. For an
introductory illustration, let us consider a very simple scenario
regarding how a first use of a nuclear weapon might occur: During the
year 2023, the US military is ordered to launch air and sea patrols of
the Taiwan Strait to aid in a crisis. These highly visible patrols
disrupt trade off China\'s coast, and result in skyrocketing insurance
rates for shipping companies. Several days into the contingency, which
involves over ten thousand US military personnel, an intelligence
estimate concludes that a Chinese conventional strike against US air
patrols and naval assets is imminent. The United States conducts a
preemptive strike against anti-air and anti-sea systems on the Chinese
mainland. The US strike is far more successful than Chinese military
leaders thought possible; a new source of intelligence to the United
States---unknown to Chinese leadership---allowed the US military to
severely degrade Chinese targeting and situational awareness
capabilities. Many of the weapons that China relied on to dissuade
escalatory US military action are now reduced to single-digit-percentage
readiness. Estimates for repairs and replenishments are stated in terms
of weeks, and China\'s confidence in readily available, but "dumber,"
weapons is low due to the dispersion and mobility of US forces. Word of
the successful US strike spreads among the Chinese and Taiwanese
publics. The Chinese Government concludes that for the sake of
preserving its domestic strength, and to signal resolve to the US and
Taiwanese Governments while minimizing further economic disruption, it
should escalate dramatically with the use of an extremely small-yield
nuclear device against a stationary US military asset in the Pacific
region. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} short story [[reflects]{.mark} a

**[2AC -- Extinction First]{.underline}**

**The aff outweighs -- extinction is the upmost moral evil and disavowal
of the risk makes it more likely**

extinction?

Many, though certainly not all, people might believe that it would be
wrong to bring about the end of the human species, and the reasons given
for this belief are various. I begin by considering four reasons that
could be given against the moral permissibility of human extinction. I
will argue that only those reasons that impact the people who exist at
the time that the extinction or the knowledge of the upcoming extinction
occurs, can explain its wrongness. I use this conclusion to then
consider in which cases human extinction would be morally permissible or
impermissible, arguing that there is only a small class of cases in
which it would not be wrong to cause the
[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark} of the human race or allow it to
happen. 2.1. It [would [prevent]{.mark} the [existence]{.mark} of very
many]{.underline} happy [people]{.underline} One reason of human
extinction might be considered to be wrong lies in the value of human
life itself. The thought here might be that [[it is]{.mark} a
[good]{.mark} thing [for people to exist]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}and enjoy happy lives [[and extinction would deprive]{.mark}
more [people of]{.mark} enjoying [this]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}good. [The 'good]{.underline}' in this case [could be
understood in]{.underline} at least [two ways.]{.underline} According to
the [first]{.underline}, one might believe that you benefit a person by
bringing them into existence, or at least, that [it is good for that
person that they come to exist]{.underline}. The second view might hold
that [if humans were to go extinct]{.underline}, [the utility
[foregone]{.mark} by the [billions]{.mark} (or more) of people who could
have lived but [will]{.mark} now [never get that
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}, renders allowing human extinction to
take place an incidence of wrongdoing. An example of this view can be
found in two quotes from an Effective Altruism blog post by Peter
Singer, Nick Beckstead and Matt Wage: One very bad thing about human
extinction would be that **[[billions of people would]{.mark} likely
[die painful deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But in our view, this is by
far not the worst thing about human extinction. [The worst thing about
human extinction is that [there would be no future
generations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since there could be so many
generations in our future, **[[the value of all those generations
together greatly exceeds the value of the current
generation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. (Beckstead, Singer, and Wage 2013)
The authors are making two claims. The first is that [there is value in
human life and]{.underline} also [something valuable about creating
future people]{.underline} which gives us a reason to do so;
furthermore, it would be a very bad thing if we did not do so. The
second is that, not only would it be a bad thing for there to be no
future people, but it would actually be the worst thing about
extinction. Since happy human lives have value, and the number of
potential people who could ever exist is far greater than the number of
people who exist at any one time, even if the extinction were brought
about through the painful deaths of currently existing people, the
former's loss would be greater than the latter's. Both claims are
assuming that there is an intrinsic value in the existence of potential
human life. The second claim makes the further assumption that the
forgone value of the potential lives that could be lived is greater than
the disvalue that would be accrued by people existing at the time of the
extinction through suffering from painful and/or premature deaths. The
best-known author of the post, Peter Singer is a prominent utilitarian,
so it is not surprising that he would lament the potential lack of
future human lives per se. However, it is not just utilitarians who
share this view, even if implicitly. Indeed, other philosophers also
seem to imply that they share the intuition that there is just something
wrong with causing or failing to prevent the extinction of the human
species such that we prevent more 'people' from having the 'opportunity
to exist'. Stephen Gardiner (2009) and Martin O'Neill (personal
correspondence), both sympathetic to contract theory, for example, also
find it intuitive that we should want more generations to have the
opportunity to exist, assuming that they have worth-living lives, and I
find it plausible to think that many other people (philosophers and
non-philosophers alike) probably share this intuition. [When we talk
about [future lives being 'prevented']{.mark}, we are saying
that]{.underline} [a possible]{.underline} person or a [set]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} possible [people who could potentially have existed
will now never actually come to exist]{.underline}. To say that it is
wrong to prevent people from existing could either mean that a possible
person could reasonably reject a principle that permitted us not to
create them, or that the foregone value of their lives provides a reason
for rejecting any principle that permits extinction. To make the first
claim we would have to argue that a possible person could reasonably
reject any principle that prevented their existence on the grounds that
it prevented them in particular from existing. However, this is
implausible for two reasons. First, we can only wrong someone who did,
does or will actually exist because wronging involves failing to take a
person's interests into account. When considering the permissibility of
a principle allowing us not to create Person X, we cannot take X's
interest in being created into account because X will not exist if we
follow the principle. By considering the standpoint of a person in our
deliberations we consider the burdens they will have to bear as a result
of the principle. In this case, there is no one who will bear any
burdens since if the principle is followed (that is, if we do not create
X), X will not exist to bear any burdens. So, only people who do/will
actually exist can bear the brunt of a principle, and therefore occupy a
standpoint that is owed justification. Second, existence is not an
interest at all and a possible person is not disadvantaged by not being
caused to exist. Rather than being an interest, it is a necessary
requirement in order to have interests. Rivka Weinberg describes it as
'neutral' because causing a person to exist is to create a subject who
can have interests; existence is not an interest itself.3 In order to be
disadvantaged, there must be some detrimental effect on your interests.
However, without existence, a person does not have any interests so they
cannot be disadvantaged by being kept out of existence. But, as Weinberg
points out, 'never having interests itself could not be contrary to
people's interests since without interest bearers, there can be no
'they' for it to be bad for' (Weinberg 2008, 13). So, a principle that
results in some possible people never becoming actual does not impose
any costs on those 'people' because nobody is disadvantaged by not
coming into existence.4 It therefore seems that it cannot be wrong to
fail to bring particular people into existence. This would mean that no
one acts wrongly when they fail to create another person. Writ large, it
would also not be wrong if everybody decided to exercise their
prerogative not to create new people and potentially, by consequence,
allow human extinction. One might respond here by saying that although
it may be permissible for one person to fail to create a new person, it
is not permissible if everyone chooses to do so because human lives have
value and allowing human extinction would be to forgo a huge amount of
value in the world. This takes us to the second way of understanding the
potential wrongness of preventing people from existing --- the foregone
value of a life provides a reason for rejecting any principle that
prevents it. One possible reply to this claim turns on the fact that
many philosophers acknowledge that the only, or at least the best, way
to think about the value of (individual or groups of) possible people's
lives is in impersonal terms (Parfit 1984; Reiman 2007; McMahan 2009).
Jeff McMahan, for example, writes 'at the time of one's choice there is
no one who exists or will exist independently of that choice for whose
sake one could be acting in causing him or her to exist ... it seems
therefore that any reason to cause or not to cause an individual to
exist ... is best considered an impersonal rather than
individual-affecting reason' (McMahan 2009, 52). Another reply along
similar lines would be to appeal to the value that is lost or at least
foregone when we fail to bring into existence a next (or several next)
generations of people with worth-living lives. Since ex hypothesi
worth-living lives have positive value, it is better to create more such
lives and worse to create fewer. Human extinction by definition is the
creation of no future lives and would 'deprive' billions of 'people' of
the opportunity to live worth-living lives. This might reduce the amount
of value in the world at the time of the extinction (by killing already
existing people), but it would also prevent a much vaster amount of
value in the future (by failing to create more people). Both replies
depend on the impersonal value of human life. However, recall that in
contractualism impersonal values are not on their own grounds for
reasonably rejecting principles. Scanlon himself says that although we
have a strong reason not to destroy existing human lives, this reason
'does not flow from the thought that it is a good thing for there to be
more human life rather than less' (104). In contractualism, something
cannot be wrong unless there is an impact on a person. Thus, neither the
impersonal value of creating a particular person nor the impersonal
value of human life writ large could on its own provide a reason for
rejecting a principle permitting human extinction. It seems therefore
that the fact that extinction would deprive future people of the
opportunity to live worth-living lives (either by failing to create
either particular future people or future people in general) cannot
provide us with a reason to consider human extinction to be wrong.
Although the lost value of these 'lives' itself cannot be the reason
explaining the wrongness of extinction, it is possible the knowledge of
this loss might create a personal reason for some existing people. I
will consider this possibility later on in section (d). But first I move
to the second reason human extinction might be wrong per se. 2.2. **[[It
would mean the loss of the only known form of intelligent life]{.mark}
and all civilization and intellectual progress would be
lost]{.underline}** A second reason we might think it would be wrong to
cause human extinction is the loss that would occur of the only (known)
form of rational life and the knowledge and civilization that that form
of life has created. One thought here could be that just as some might
consider it wrong to destroy an individual human heritage monument like
the Sphinx, it would also be wrong if the advances made by humans over
the past few millennia were lost or prevented from progressing. A
related argument is made by those who feel that there is something
special about [[humans' capacity for rationality]{.underline}]{.mark}
which [[is valuable in itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since humans are the
only intelligent life that we know of, it would be a loss, in itself, to
the world for that to end. I admit that I struggle to fully appreciate
this thought. It seems to me that Henry Sidgwick was correct in thinking
that these things are only important insofar as they are important to
humans (Sidgwick 1874, I.IX.4).5 If there is no form of intelligent life
in the future, who would there be to lament its loss since intelligent
life is the only form of life capable of appreciating intelligence?
Similarly, if there is no one with the rational capacity to appreciate
historic monuments and civil progress, who would there be to be
negatively affected or even notice the loss?6 However, even if there is
nothing special about human rationality, just as some people try to
prevent the extinction of nonhuman animal species, we might think that
[we ought also to prevent human extinction for the sake of
biodiversity]{.underline}. The thought in this, as well as the earlier
examples, must be that it would somehow be bad for the world if there
were no more humans even though there would be no one for whom it is
bad. This may be so but the only way to understand this reason is
impersonally. Since we are concerned with wrongness rather than badness,
we must ask whether something that impacts no one's well-being, status
or claims can be wrong. As we saw earlier, in the contractualist
framework reasons must be personal rather than impersonal in order to
provide grounds for reasonable rejection (Scanlon 1998, 218--223). Since
the loss of civilization, intelligent life or biodiversity are per se
impersonal reasons, there is no standpoint from which these reasons
could be used to reasonably reject a principle that permitted
extinction. Therefore, causing human extinction on the grounds of the
loss of civilization, rational life or biodiversity would not be wrong.
2.3. **[[Existing people would endure physical pain and]{.mark}/or
[painful]{.mark} and/or [premature deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}Thinking about the ways in which human extinction might come
about brings to the fore two more reasons it might be wrong. It could,
for example, occur if all humans (or at least the critical number needed
to be unable to replenish the population, leading to eventual
extinction) underwent a sterilization procedure. Or perhaps it could
come about due to anthropogenic climate change or a massive asteroid
hitting the Earth and wiping out the species in the same way it did the
dinosaurs millions of years ago. [Each]{.underline} of these
[scenario]{.underline}s [would involve significant physical]{.underline}
[and/]{.underline}or [non-physical harms]{.underline} to existing people
and their interests. Physically, people might suffer premature and
possibly also painful deaths, for example. It is not hard to imagine
examples in which the process of [extinction could cause]{.underline}
[premature death]{.underline}. [A nuclear winter]{.underline} [that
killed everyone or even just every woman under the age of 50 is a clear
example of such a case]{.underline}. Obviously, some types of premature
death themselves cannot be reasons to reject a principle. Every person
dies eventually, sometimes earlier than the standard expected lifespan
due to accidents or causes like spontaneously occurring incurable
cancers. A cause such as disease is not a moral agent and therefore it
cannot be wrong if it unavoidably kills a person prematurely. Scanlon
says that the fact that a principle would reduce a person's well-being
gives that person a reason to reject the principle: 'components of
well-being figure prominently as grounds for reasonable rejection'
(Scanlon 1998, 214). However, it is not settled yet whether premature
death is a setback to well-being. Some philosophers hold that death is a
harm to the person who dies, whilst others argue that it is not.7 I will
argue, however, that regardless of who is correct in that debate, [being
caused to die prematurely can be reason to [reject a principle when it
fails to show respect to]{.mark} the [person as]{.mark} a [rational
agent]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scanlon says that recognizing others as
rational beings with interests involves seeing reason to preserve life
and prevent death: '[appreciating]{.underline} [the value of human life
is primarily a matter of]{.underline} [seeing human lives
as]{.underline} something [to be respected]{.underline}, where this
involves seeing reasons not to destroy them, reasons to protect them,
and reasons to want them to go well' (Scanlon 1998, 104). The 'respect
for life' in this case is a respect for the person living, not respect
for human life in the abstract. This means that we can sometimes fail to
protect human life without acting wrongfully if we still respect the
person living. Scanlon gives the example of a person who faces a life of
unending and extreme pain such that she wishes to end it by committing
suicide. Scanlon does not think that the suicidal person shows a lack of
respect for her own life by seeking to end it because the person whose
life it is has no reason to want it to go on. This is important to note
because it emphasizes the fact that the respect for human life is
person-affecting. It is not wrong to murder because of the impersonal
disvalue of death in general, but because [taking someone's life without
their permission shows disrespect to that person]{.underline}. This
supports its inclusion as a reason in the contractualist formula,
regardless of what side ends up winning the 'is death a harm?' debate
because even if death turns out not to harm the person who died, ending
their life without their consent shows disrespect to that person. A
person who could reject a principle permitting another to cause his or
her premature death presumably does not wish to die at that time, or in
that manner. Thus, **[if they are [killed without their consent]{.mark},
their [interests have not been taken into
account]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and they have a reason to reject the
principle that allowed their premature death.8 This is as true in the
case of death due to extinction as it is for death due to murder.
However, physical pain may also be caused to existing people without
killing them, but still resulting in human extinction. Imagine, for
example, surgically removing everyone's reproductive organs in order to
prevent the creation of any future people. Another example could be [a
nuclear bomb that did not kill anyone, but did painfully render them
infertile through illness or injury]{.underline}. These would be cases
in which physical pain (through surgery or bombs) was inflicted on
existing people and the extinction came about as a result of the painful
incident rather than through death. Furthermore, one could imagine a
situation in which a bomb (for example) killed enough people to cause
extinction, but some people remained alive, but in terrible pain from
injuries. It seems uncontroversial that the infliction of physical pain
could be a reason to reject a principle. Although Scanlon says that an
impact on well-being is not the only reason to reject principles, it
plays a significant role, and indeed, most principles are likely to be
rejected due to a negative impact on a person's well-being, physical or
otherwise. It may be queried here whether it is actually the
involuntariness of the pain that is grounds for reasonable rejection
rather than the physical pain itself because not all pain that a person
suffers is involuntary. One can imagine acts that can cause physical
pain that are not rejectable --- base jumping or life-saving or
improving surgery, for example. On the other hand, pushing someone off a
cliff or cutting him with a scalpel against his will are clearly
rejectable acts. The difference between the two cases is that in the
former, the person having the pain inflicted has consented to that pain
or risk of pain. My view is that they cannot be separated in these cases
and it is involuntary physical pain that is the grounds for reasonable
rejection. Thus, the fact that a principle would allow unwanted physical
harm gives a person who would be subjected to that harm a reason to
reject the principle. Of course the mere fact that a principle causes
involuntary physical harm or premature death is not sufficient to
declare that the principle is rejectable --- there might be
countervailing reasons. In the case of extinction, what countervailing
reasons might be offered in favour of the involuntary physical pain/
death-inducing harm? One such reason that might be offered is that
humans are a harm to the natural environment and that the world might be
a better place if there were no humans in it. It could be that humans
might rightfully be considered an all-things-considered hindrance to the
world rather than a benefit to it given the fact that we have been
largely responsible for the extinction of many species, pollution and,
most recently, climate change which have all negatively affected the
natural environment in ways we are only just beginning to understand.
Thus, the fact that human extinction would improve the natural
environment (or at least prevent it from degrading further), is a
countervailing reason in favour of extinction to be weighed against the
reasons held by humans who would experience physical pain or premature
death. However, the good of the environment as described above is by
definition not a personal reason. Just like the loss of rational life
and civilization, therefore, it cannot be a reason on its own when
determining what is wrong and countervail the strong personal reasons to
avoid pain/death that is held by the people who would suffer from it.9
Every person existing at the time of the extinction would have a reason
to reject that principle on the grounds of the physical pain they are
being forced to endure against their will that could not be
countervailed by impersonal considerations such as the negative impact
humans may have on the earth. Therefore, a principle that permitted
extinction to be accomplished in a way that caused involuntary physical
pain or premature death could quite clearly be rejectable by existing
people with no relevant countervailing reasons. This means that human
extinction that came about in this way would be wrong. There are of
course also additional reasons they could reject a similar principle
which I now turn to address in the next section. 2.4. **[[Existing
people could endure non-physical harms]{.underline}]{.mark}** I said
earlier than [the fact]{.underline} in itself that [there would not be
any future people]{.underline} is an impersonal reason and can therefore
not be a reason to reject a principle permitting extinction. However,
this impersonal reason [could give rise to a personal
reason]{.underline} that is admissible. So, the final important reason
people might think that human extinction would be wrong is that [[there
could be various]{.mark} deleterious [psychological
effects]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}that would be endured by existing
people having the knowledge that there would be no future generations.
[There are two main sources of this trauma]{.underline}, both arising
from the knowledge that there will be no more people. [The first relates
to individual people and the undesired negative effect on
well-being]{.underline} [that would be experienced by those who would
have wanted to have children]{.underline}. Whilst **[this is [by no
means universal]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[it is fair to say that a good
proportion of people feel a strong pull towards
reproduction]{.underline}** and having their lineage continue in some
way. Samuel Scheffler describes the pull towards reproduction as a
'desire for a personalized relationship with the future' (Scheffler
2012, 31). Reproducing is a widely held desire and the joys of
parenthood are ones that many people wish to experience. For these
people knowing that they would not have descendants (or that their
descendants will endure painful and/or premature deaths) could create a
sense of despair and pointlessness of life. Furthermore, the inability
to reproduce and have your own children because of a principle/policy
that prevents you (either through bans or physical interventions) would
be a significant infringement of what we consider to be a basic right to
control what happens to your body. For these reasons, knowing that you
will have no descendants could cause significant psychological traumas
or harms even if there were no associated physical harm. [The second is
a]{.underline} more general, [higher level [sense of
hopelessness]{.mark} or [despair]{.mark} that [there will be no more
humans and that your projects will end with
you]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Even those who did not feel a strong
desire to procreate themselves might feel a sense of hopelessness that
any projects or goals they have for the future would not be
fulfilled]{.underline}. Many of the projects and goals we work towards
during our lifetime are also at least partly future-oriented. Why bother
continuing the search for a cure for cancer if either it will not be
found within humans' lifetime, and/or there will be no future people to
benefit from it once it is found? Similar projects and goals that might
lose their meaning when confronted with extinction include politics,
artistic pursuits and even the type of philosophical work with which
this paper is concerned. Even more extreme, through the words of the
character Theo Faron, P.D. James says in his novel The Children of Men
that '[without the hope of posterity for our race]{.underline} if not
for ourselves, without the assurance that we being dead yet live, [all
pleasures of the mind and senses sometimes seem to me no more than
pathetic and crumbling defences shored up against our
ruins']{.underline} (James 2006, 9). Even if James' claim is a bit
hyperbolic and all pleasures would not actually be lost, I agree with
Scheffler in finding it not implausible that the knowledge that
extinction was coming and that there would be no more people would have
at least a general depressive effect on people's motivation and
confidence in the value of and joy in their activities (Scheffler 2012,
43). [Both sources of [psychological harm are personal reasons to
reject]{.mark} a [principle that permitted human
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Existing people could therefore
reasonably reject the principle for either of these reasons.
Psychological pain and the inability to pursue your personal projects,
goals, and aims, are all acceptable reasons for rejecting principles in
the contractualist framework. So too are infringements of rights and
entitlements that we accept as important for people's lives. These
psychological reasons, then, are also valid reasons to reject principles
that permitted or required human extinction.

In this argument, it seems that Parfit is assuming that the survivors of
a nuclear war that kills 99% of the population would eventually be able
to recover civilisation without long-term effect. As we have seen, this
may not be a safe assumption -- but for the purposes of this thought
experiment, the point stands. What makes [existential
catastrophes]{.underline} especially bad is that they [would "destroy
the future,"]{.underline} as another Oxford philosopher, Nick Bostrom,
puts it.66 [This future could]{.underline} potentially [be **extremely
long** and **full of flourishing**, and]{.underline} would therefore
[have **extremely large value**. In standard risk analysis]{.underline},
when working out how to respond to risk, [we [work out]{.mark} the
expected [value]{.mark}]{.underline} of risk reduction, [by weighing
**the probability**]{.underline} that [an action will prevent **an
adverse event** against **the severity** of the event.
Because]{.underline} the value of preventing [existential catastrophe is
**so vast**, **even [a tiny probability]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
prevention [[has **huge**]{.mark} **expected
[value]{.mark}**]{.underline}.67 Of course, there is persisting
reasonable disagreement about ethics and there are a number of ways one
might resist this conclusion.68 Therefore, it would be unjustified to be
overconfident in Parfit and Bostrom's argument. In some areas,
government policy does give significant weight to future generations.
For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear waste storage,
governments have considered timeframes of thousands, hundreds of
thousands, and even a million years.69 [Justifications]{.underline} for
this policy usually [appeal to principles of ***intergenerational
equity*** according to which **future generations** ought to get **as
much protection** as current generations]{.underline}.70 Similarly,
widely accepted norms of sustainable development require development
that meets the needs of the current generation without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs.71 However, when
it comes to **[[ex]{.mark}istential [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it
[would]{.underline} seem that we [[fail to live up to]{.mark} principles
of **intergenerational [equity]{.mark}**. Existential [catastrophe
would]{.mark} not only [give future gen]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} **less
than the current generations**; it would give them
***[nothing]{.mark}***]{.underline}. Indeed, [reducing existential
risk]{.underline} plausibly [has **a quite low cost** for us in
comparison with **the huge expected value** it has for future
generations. In spite of this, **relatively little** is done to reduce
existential risk]{.underline}. Unless we give up on [norms of
**intergenerational equity**]{.underline}, they [give us **a strong
case**]{.underline} for significantly increasing our efforts [to reduce
existential risks]{.underline}. 1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE
SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY In spite of the importance of [existential risk
reduction]{.underline}, it probably [receives **less attention** than is
warranted]{.underline}. As a result, concerted international cooperation
is required if we are to receive adequate protection from existential
risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be underinvested in
There are several reasons why existential risk reduction is likely to be
underinvested in. Firstly, it is *a global public good*. Economic theory
predicts that such goods tend to be underprovided. The benefits of
existential risk reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed around
the globe from the countries responsible for taking action.
Consequently, [a country which reduces **existential risk** gains **only
a small portion** of the benefits but bears **the full brunt of the
costs**. Countries]{.underline} thus [have **strong incentives** to free
ride]{.underline}, receiving the benefits of risk reduction without
contributing. As a result, too few do what is in the common interest.
Secondly, as already suggested above, [**existential risk reduction** is
**an *intergenerational* public good**]{.underline}: most of [the
benefits are enjoyed by **future generations** who have **no say** in
the political process]{.underline}. For these goods, [the [problem is
***temporal* free riding**]{.mark}: the current [gen]{.mark}eration
[enjoys]{.mark} **the benefits of [inaction]{.mark}** [while future
gen]{.mark}eration[s bear **the costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thirdly,
many existential risks, such as machine superintelligence, engineered
pandemics, and solar geoengineering, pose an unprecedented and uncertain
future threat. Consequently, it is hard to develop a satisfactory
governance regime for them: there are few existing governance
instruments which can be applied to these risks, and it is unclear what
shape new instruments should take. In this way, our position with regard
to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we faced when nuclear
weapons first became available. **[Cognitive
[biases]{.mark}]{.underline}** also [[lead people to underestimate
ex]{.mark}istential [risks]{.mark}. Since there have not been **any
catastrophes** of this magnitude, these risks are **not
salient**]{.underline} to politicians and the public.72 [[This
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an example of the misapplication of [**the
*[availability]{.mark} [heuristic]{.mark}***, a mental shortcut which
[assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[something is important]{.mark}
**only [if]{.mark}** it can be **readily
[recalled]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[Another cognitive
bias]{.underline}** affecting perceptions of existential risk [is
**[scope neglect]{.mark}**. In **a seminal 1992 study**, three groups
were asked how much they would]{.underline} be [willing to pay to save
2,000]{.underline}, 20,000 [or 200,000 birds]{.underline} from drowning
in uncovered oil ponds. The groups answered \$80, \$78, and \$88,
respectively.73 In this case, [[the size of]{.mark} the
[benefits]{.mark} had [**little effect** on]{.mark} the scale of the
preferred [response]{.mark}. [People]{.mark} **become [numbed]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the effect of [saving lives when]{.mark} the [numbers get
**too large**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} 74 [Scope neglect is **a
particularly acute problem** for existential risk because the numbers at
stake are **so large**]{.underline}. Due to scope neglect,
[decision-makers]{.underline} are prone to [treat existential
risks]{.underline} in a [similar]{.underline} way [to
problems]{.underline} which are [less severe by]{.underline} many orders
of [magnitude]{.underline}. A wide range of other cognitive biases are
likely to affect the evaluation of existential risks.75

[The project of]{.underline} critical [security studies was born out of
an **acknowledgement**]{.underline} [of the implicit]{.underline} and
[explicit **violence**]{.underline} [stemming from the
hegemony]{.underline} of
**[security]{.underline}**-cum-**[balance]{.underline}**. In what
follows, [I will discuss the limits of both]{.underline}
**[deconstructive]{.underline}** and reconstructive
**[approaches]{.underline}** in critical security studies' engagement
with the dominant logics of security.

[The deconstructive field includes]{.underline} a number of
[epistemological endeavors]{.underline} -- [including
poststructuralist]{.underline}, constructivist, neo-Marxist, post- and
de-colonial, feminist, and queer approaches -- [to overcome
**traditional**]{.underline}, [**realist** views of
**security**]{.underline}. This field has been quite successful -- to
the point of constituting a new mainstream in security studies14 -- in
[exposing the '**dark side'** of security]{.underline}, its role in
impeding the realization of a democratic politics (see Neal, 2019), and
more generally its crucial role in the maintenance of the capitalist
order (with its violence!). [The]{.underline} [ultimate version of this
critique is]{.underline} offered by Mark [Neocleous]{.underline},
[who]{.underline}, by exposing the roots of contemporary security,
beyond Hobbes, in liberal and Enlightenment thinkers such as Mill,
Rousseau, Smith, and Bentham, [has challenged the
'**myth'**]{.underline} [of the **balance**]{.underline} at its roots:
[security has]{.underline} [always been the **central goal**
of]{.underline} **[liberal thought]{.underline}**, [and liberty is
systematically infringed in **security's name**]{.underline} (Neocleous,
2007, 2008). **[Security]{.underline}**, **[Neocleous
concluded]{.underline}**, is the political technology of liberalism; it
is a project of social order (Neocleous, 2001) and **[must therefore be
rejected]{.underline}** (Neocleous, 2000). [The rejection]{.underline}
of security remains [at the core of other strands of
deconstruction]{.underline}. For instance, among the central tenets of
the Copenhagen School is the idea that securitization is at odds with
politics. Indeed, Ole Wæver (2011: 478n2) has even characterized
security as a Schmittian concept. Granted, I am not suggesting that
deconstructive approaches are not interested in the 'tangible
security'15 of individuals and communities -- quite the opposite -- but
rather that they have explicitly or implicitly concluded that only by
abandoning the concept of 'security' -- and, in some cases, replacing it
with other concepts like care or humanism -- can we strive for it.

I want to argue, then, that [the critique of
**securitization**]{.underline}, liberal balance, and the persistent
chimera of absolute security [does **not imply** that we need to
**reject security as a concept**]{.underline}. In order to make this
point, I will start by unpacking a corollary of the deconstructive
argument, [the]{.underline} [idea]{.underline} that [security is
inherently **antagonistic**]{.underline} [to **rights**]{.underline}
(Goldstein, 2010: 499). [This formulation]{.underline}, which is
coherent with the deconstruction of the myth of balancing security with
freedom, [neglects to **acknowledge** that]{.underline}
**[security]{.underline}** [is a **right too**]{.underline}, [though not
**only a right**]{.underline}.16 [Security]{.underline} -- a certain
degree [of freedom from threats]{.underline} -- [is]{.underline}
**[necessary]{.underline}** [for the **flourishing of
individuals**]{.underline} (see Nussbaum, 2011) [and for the
**empowerment**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[oppressed
groups]{.underline}** (see, for instance, bell hooks \[1991: 47\] [on
the importance of the **home**]{.underline} [as a space of **personal
safety** in the experience of black and brown women in the
USA]{.underline}). [Once we take **security** beyond
**securitization**]{.underline} [seriously, the **limits** of
**deconstructive critique**]{.underline} [become]{.underline}
**[evident]{.underline}**. [For one thing, by **overly focusing on
security as discourse and speech act**]{.underline}, [constructivist and
post-structuralist approaches]{.underline} (e.g. Huysmans, 2011;
Williams, 2003) [have largely **neglected** to engage]{.underline} [with
**insecurity**]{.underline} [and violence **existing beyond
securitization**]{.underline} [and the machine of state
security]{.underline}. On their side, critiques brought to the core of
security theories have demonstrated that actually existing security is
inherently defined by the liberal/Western project of social order, [but
this does not **exclude per se**]{.underline} [the possibility of
finding **different roots** for]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**
[outside of that very]{.underline} order -- [security
existed]{.underline}, for better or worse, [before the liberal order was
created]{.underline}, [and there may well be theories of security
**outside** of the **hegemony**]{.underline} [of
liberal]{.underline}/[Western thought]{.underline}. By [focusing on
**discourses**]{.underline}, [theories, and practices]{.underline}
(Harrington, 2017), in short, **[critique has]{.underline}** [forgotten
the **ontological dimension**]{.underline} -- [that is, 'the desire for
security -- **understood** as **certitude and trust**]{.underline} --
\[[which\] is seemingly **universal and timeless'**]{.underline}
(Harrington, 2017: 76, emphasis added).

Affairs, 11-xx-2015,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-10-20/delusions-grand-strategy

Instead of obsessing over strategy, [Washington should adopt a more
pragmatic approach]{.underline} to questions of policy. [This would
involve]{.underline} four main elements.

The first is [narrative pluralism. When a single narrative dominates
policy debates, only a limited range of options can be considered. At
the height of the Cold War consensus]{.underline}, for example,
[legitimate voices hewed to anticommunist axioms, which prevented
Washington from seizing opportunities to]{.underline} fracture the
communist bloc and [negotiate a stable arrangement with the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. Now, with the United States relatively secure and
the future of the global order up in the air, there should be room for
differing views over national security; there is no excuse for enforced
homogeneity. [Narrative pluralism facilitates flexibility, which runs
counter to the impulse to strategize]{.underline}. It is also often
unpopular. [Uncomfortable with narrative disorder, people clamor for
their leaders to make sense of the world around them]{.underline}. If
presidents fail to do so, they are pilloried as "unstrategic." [The
challenge for leaders]{.underline} today [is to satisfy the public's
demand for narrative order without overly narrowing the scope of
debate]{.underline}.

Second, [pragmatism involves **focusing on specific challenges** in lieu
of searching for an overarching foreign policy doctrine. Doctrines force
leaders to act for the sake of seeming consistent, even when it would be
wiser not to]{.underline}. Even offhand comments at press conferences
somehow become ironclad promises, or so Obama and his critics believed
when it came to Syrian chemical weapons use, and the pressures mount all
the more with officially endorsed doctrines. [A pragmatic approach would
**consider threats on their own terms** rather than as part of a larger
strategic worldview. And it would sustain a more **restrained foreign
policy** that avoids the distraction of peripheral
interventions]{.underline}.

Third, [a pragmatic approach would replace the ritual of periodic
strategizing with more regular venues for officials to articulate the
logic behind policy]{.underline}. Although national security sometimes
requires secrecy, there are limits to what democratically elected
governments should withhold from citizens. Citizens have the right to
demand that their leaders explain their foreign policy priorities and
initiatives and that their representatives in Congress, rather than
engage in political grandstanding, ask hard questions of and demand real
answers from the executive branch. An aggressive press, alongside strong
freedomof-information legislation, is an essential bulwark of democracy.
But the periodic publication of a formal national security
strategy---and the many related documents released down the bureaucratic
ladder---does not provide meaningful transparency. In its current form,
strategizing is little more than political spectacle.

Finally, [pragmatism calls for a more **experimental approach** to
foreign policy. Creativity emerges only from an organizational and
political environment that eschews rigid strategy and tolerates failure.
Successful organizations adapt fluidly to changing circumstances, create
cultures that permit experimentation, and learn from their
errors]{.underline}. The first rule of foreign policy should remain "Do
no harm," but much international harm can come from playing it safe.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must cultivate a
bureaucratic and political climate that is forgiving of small failures.
Only in that atmosphere can the country's foreign-policy makers go after
the big wins---and leave strategizing behind]{.underline}.

alternative is epistemically valuable.**

Security Studies," Security Dialogue, 8-15-2012,
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0967010612450747

[In the works of these authors]{.underline}, [one can identify a
tendency to see security as inherently connected]{.underline} [to
exclusion, totalization and]{.underline} even [violence]{.underline}.
The idea of a 'logic' of security is now widely present in the critical
security studies literature. Claudia Aradau (2008: 72), for example,
writes of an 'exclusionary logic of security' underpinning and
legitimizing 'forms of domination'. Rens van Munster (2007: 239) assumes
a 'logic of security', predicated upon a 'political organization on the
exclusionary basis of fear'. Laura Shepherd (2008: 70) also identifies a
liberal and highly problematic 'organizational logic' in security.
Although there would probably be disagreement over the degree to which
[this logic]{.underline} is inescapable, it [is symptomatic of an
overwhelmingly pessimistic]{.underline} [outlook]{.underline} that a
great number of critical scholars are now making the case for moving
away from security. The normative preference for desecuritization has
been picked up in attempts to contest, resist and 'unmake' security
(Aradau, 2004; Huysmans, 2006; Bigo, 2007). For these contributions,
security cannot be reconstructed and political transformation can only
be brought about when security and its logic are removed from the
equation (Aradau, 2008; Van Munster, 2009; Peoples, 2011). [This
tendency]{.underline} in the literature [is **problematic**]{.underline}
for the critique of security in at least three ways. [First, it
constitutes a blind spot in the effort of politicization.]{.underline}
[The assumption of a]{.underline}n exclusionary, totalizing or [violent
logic]{.underline} of security [can be seen as an essentialization and
**a moment of closure**]{.underline}. To be faithful to itself, the
politicization of security would need to recognize that there is nothing
natural or necessary about security -- and that security as a paradigm
of thought or a register of meaning is also a construction that depends
upon its reproduction and performance through practice.
[The]{.underline} exclusionary and [violent meanings that have been
attached to security are]{.underline} themselves [the]{.underline}
[result of social and historical processes]{.underline}, [and **can**
thus **be changed**]{.underline}. [Second, the institution of this
apolitical realm runs counter to the purposes of critique by
**foreclosing an engagement** with the different ways in which security
may be constructed]{.underline}. As Matt McDonald (2012) has argued,
[because security means different things for different
people,]{.underline} **[one must always understand it in
context]{.underline}**. [Assuming from the start that security implies
the narrowing]{.underline} [of choice and the empowerment of an elite
forecloses the acknowledgment of security claims that may seek to
achieve exactly the opposite]{.underline}: [alternative
possibilities]{.underline} in an already narrow debate [and]{.underline}
[the contestation of elite power]{.underline}.5 In connection to this,
[the claims to insecurity]{.underline} put forward by individuals and
groups [run the risk of being **neglected**]{.underline} [if the desire
to be more secure is identified with]{.underline} [a compulsion towards
totalization]{.underline}, [and if aspirations to a life with a degree
of predictability are]{.underline} [identified with
violence.]{.underline} Finally, [this tendency **blunts** **critical**
**security studies as a resource for** practical
**politics**]{.underline}. [By overlooking]{.underline} [the possibility
of **reconsidering security from within**]{.underline} -- [opting
instead for its replacement]{.underline} with other ideals -- [the
critical field weakens its capacity to confront head-on the
exceptionalist]{.underline} [connotations that security has acquired in
policymaking circles]{.underline}. [Critical scholars run the risk of
playing into this agenda when they tie security to]{.underline}
exclusionary and [violent practices]{.underline}, [thereby failing to
question security actors as they take those views for granted and act as
if they were inevitable]{.underline}. Overall, security is just too
important -- both as a concept and as a political instrument -- to be
simply abandoned by critical scholars. As McDonald (2012: 163) has put
it, If security is politically powerful, is the foundation of political
legitimacy for a range of actors, and involves the articulation of our
core values and the means of their protection, we cannot afford to allow
dominant discourses of security to be confused with the essence of
security itself. In sum, the trajectory that [critical security
studies]{.underline} has taken in recent years [has significant
**limitations**]{.underline}. The politicization of security has made
extraordinary progress in problematizing predominant security ideas and
practices; however, it has paradoxically resulted in a depoliticization
of the meaning of security itself. [By foreclosing the possibility of
alternative notions of security, this imbalanced politicization weakens
the analytical capacity of critical security studies, undermines its
ability to function as a political resource and runs the risk of
**being** politically **counterproductive**]{.underline}. Seeking to
address these limitations, the next section revisits emancipatory
understandings of security.

Tragedy is largely absent from the existing normative debate on
securitization. Instead, the [debate has]{.underline} become [organized
around whether securitization is a "negative" or "positive"
concept]{.underline}. In the classic formulation, the Copenhagen School
points to how "\[n\]ational security should not be idealized. It works
to silence opposition and has given power-holders many opportunities to
exploit 'threats' for domestic purposes" (Buzan et al. 1998, 29;
Williams 2003). [Securitization has negative effects when it functions
as "a political technology that consistently favors the interests of the
powerful and enables violence and exclusion"]{.underline} (McDonald
2015, 154). Correspondingly, Wæver admits a "'bias' for
desecuritization" or de-escalation, although he quickly notes that this
is "not always better than securitization" (Wæver 2011, 469). [At the
same time]{.underline}, a number of approaches point to cases where
[securitization]{.underline} [is ethically desirable]{.underline}. In
her compelling consequentialist argument, for example, Floyd asks
"whether the consequences of, and the gains from, the securitization are
preferable relative to the consequences and gains from a politicization"
(2007, 338). Relatedly, Roe contends that "[the extent to which
securitization necessitates a lack of openness and deliberation has been
overexaggerated" and suggests it may even elicit unappreciated forms of
cooperation]{.underline} (2012, 250).

[The problem with the negative/positive debate is that it appears to
impose moral certitude where there often is none.]{.underline}
[Registering securitizing moves as clearly positive or negative can be
difficult because their effects can be mixed and temporally
distant]{.underline}. The difficulty in making this determination may
also be an indicator of the uncertainty surrounding securitizing moves.
[In the end, because the outcomes of security claims are uncertain, we
cannot know in advance whether they will lead to positive or negative
consequences.]{.underline} Instead, [we should entertain a distinctly
tragic vision of securitization that council]{.underline}s [an ethic of
self-limitation]{.underline}. The core of this tragic vision is a
recognition that the powerful allure of using security talk to "gain
control" over a situation will always be present (Wæver 1995, 54).
However, we should also recognize that this control is always illusory
because it presumes all of its effects can be predetermined. The tragedy
of securitization is that the failure to recognize how contingency
imposes limits on action lures political actors into a false sense of
certainty and the conviction that they can determine the future. This
leads to a hubristic adoption of "misplaced certainty," such as when
Vice President Dick Cheney declared in August of 2002 that "there is no
doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction" (quoted
in Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 3). A similar situation emerged when
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld subsequently claimed in November
that the Iraq conflict could be "\[f\]ive days or five weeks or five
months, but it certainly isn't going to last any longer than that"
(Esterbrook 2002). A similarly misplaced certainty is evident in US
General Stanley McChrystal's assurances to the Obama administration in
2009 that a surge in troops and resources were critical to stave off
American defeat in Afghanistan (Woodward 2009). More recently, it is
visible in President Donald Trump's 2018 assertion that he was "100
percent right" on the weaknesses of the Iran nuclear deal (CNN 2018).

Yet, tragedy cuts both ways. [Blanket opposition]{.underline} [to
securitizing moves]{.underline} can also [have unanticipated
effects]{.underline}. Ironically, the [desecuritization of an issue may
not just result in its repoliticization]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} its [disappearance from public view]{.underline} (Floyd
2010, 57--58). [Viewing security discourse as negative also underplays
how the management of threats can serve as a focal point for democratic
cooperation among different political actors]{.underline} (Roe 2012,
250, 257--58). The point is not that every security discourse and the
practices it justifies has catastrophically perverse consequences.
Instead, the goal is to highlight a sensible restraint over the limits
of seeing into the future, how this shapes choice, and the dangers of
hubris that follow. [When]{.underline} properly [adapted]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} this [constructivist context]{.underline}, the tragic
vision of [securitization can be an important tool in cultivating
prudence and restraint]{.underline} (cf. Lebow 2003, 364).

The problem with this tragic vision is that it points to
[processes]{.underline} that [are never]{.underline} entirely [in our
possession]{.underline}. [Whether in the form of background
knowledge]{.underline} (Pouliot 2008), [habits]{.underline} (Hopf 2010),
[or routines]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006), much of [social life occurs
without conscious deliberation]{.underline} and reflection. These forms
of unthinking action impair reflexivity and limit actors' ability to see
how the world might be different and thus how outcomes can be uncertain.
In some cases, this can be benign, such as the unreflexive amity between
Canada and the United States that allows these countries to "escape"
from the traditional security dilemma (Collins 2014, 572--73). But just
as practices of amity can be habitual, so too can enmity. [The hawkish
US senator may designate Iran's nuclear program as threatening because
that is what hawkish US senators do, and there is no perceived way to be
hawkish otherwise]{.underline}. The result is that the uncertainty
surrounding securitizing moves becomes concealed under an unthinking
veil of common sense. The tragedy of securitization then is not only
that political figures often exceed their limitations by ignoring how
contingency can derail securitizing moves---it is that these limitations
often never even register

This means overcoming the tragedy of securitization require a certain
degree self-reflexivity. This is similar to what Booth and Wheeler
describe as the "security dilemma sensibility," or an actor's ability
and willingness to reflect upon their actions, including one's own role
in provoking insecurity in others (2008, 7). By sensitizing leaders to
how uncertainty is an endemic feature of political life, and how their
actions can be interpreted in unintended ways, security competition can
be mitigated, at least in part (Booth and Wheeler 2008, 265). Yet, these
moments of self-awareness and [reflection]{.underline} [are
difficult]{.underline} precisely [because there are powerful forces that
demand simplicity and closure: namely our desire for a stable sense of
self or what is widely referred to as ontological security]{.underline}
(Mitzen 2006). [Reflecting on the uncertainty of international politics
can erode one's sense of identity and agency]{.underline}, [ultimately
leading to a "deep, incapacitating state of not knowing how to get by in
the world"]{.underline} (Mitzen and Schweller 2011, 29). Booth and
Wheeler's security dilemma sensibility may have the laudable goal of
alerting leaders to the role of uncertainty in political life, but this
confronts the problem that many would prefer that it remain hidden.

The consequence is that this tragic aspect of the securitization dilemma
takes on an intractable character. Either unwilling or unable to "know
one's limits," as Herz would say (1950, 179), the role of uncertainty
becomes hidden and security claims appear as a reliable strategy for
control and influence. Like the classic realist dilemma, the
securitization dilemma is pervasive because it is often invisible. The
compelling need for a logic of selflimitation---of a careful and
reflective use of security language and how it can be derailed by
contingency--- is obscured because of an aversion to
recognizinguncertainty. It is this specter of a need for reflection and
restraint that may not be realized, I suggest, which demands that we
rethink the role of the analyst in provoking reflexivity among
power-holders.

Conclusion: Rethinking the Role of the Analyst

Motivated by the absence of unintended and perverse consequences in
constructivist theorizing of security, this article has pursued a
reconceptualization of the security dilemma. Viewing the dilemma as a
logic of limitation shaped by choice, uncertainty, and tragedy, the
argument focuses on transposing this logic to the constructivist context
of securitization theory. By showing how the choice to engage in the
social construction of threats is complicated by uncertainty and the
tragic failure to recognize one's own limits, the dilemma analytic helps
us to understand how securitization can be both a potent instrument for
mobilization, as well as a volatile source of unpredictability.
Moreover, this conceptual lens lays the foundation for an ethical
imperative of self-limitation among securitizing actors---albeit one
made difficult given the desire for simplicity and closure. Far from a
rebuke of constructivist theorizing, the argument shows that taking the
social character of security seriously means appreciating how political
claims are always vulnerable to being derailed by different types of
contingency.

This reconstructive move has important implications for studying the
social construction of security. First, while the initial influence of
realism on securitization theory is well-documented (Floyd 2010; Gad and
Peterson 2011), few attempts have been made to show how engaging with
these realist roots can yield new insights.22 Here, the reconstruction
of the security dilemma demonstrates how [returning to realist themes
can yield a fresh insights]{.underline}. Second, the argument pushes
scholars studying securitization to expand their universe of outcomes
beyond the reductive binary of success and failure and to consider cases
of perverse and unintended consequences. Not only are these outcomes
relatively common, they undercut the prevailing image of securitization
as a reliable technology of control. Third, the securitization dilemma
shows why uncertainty is more of an enduring problem for social action
than constructivists typically acknowledge. Contra earlier arguments
where learning and socialization effectively mitigate the problem of
uncertainty (Wendt 2006, 208--9), this perspective stresses how
contingency means that social acts like securitizing moves can have
unpredictable effects.

The most important result of this reconstruction, however, may be in how
taking the tragic element of the dilemma seriously reorders the
political role of the analyst. [Rather than assessing]{.underline} the
validity of [a particular security discourse]{.underline}, [or exposing
its socially constructed nature]{.underline}, [this
perspective]{.underline} asks the analyst to [provoke]{.underline}
[reflexivity]{.underline} [on behalf of power-holders over the risks
associated with securitization]{.underline}. While this entails a bias
toward deescalation and desecuritization, unlike other approaches this
is [not achieved through]{.underline} overt references to
[an]{.underline}y liberal, democratic, or [emancipatory
ideal]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, [it is packaged for
power-holders as a strategy of self-preservation]{.underline}. Here, the
analyst presents the move to securitize as a risk-laden and potentially
self-defeating strategy. The analyst points to a series of precedents
showing how such a strategy can produce perverse consequences: how
today\'s tough talk can become tomorrow\'s liability; how audiences can
interpret threatening messages in unexpected ways; and how today\'s
framing of security can lead to perverse consequences tomorrow. By
foregrounding the problem of uncertainty, the analyst works to
accentuate and impress upon actors the dilemmatic quality of
securitizing moves.

Yet, the problem with presenting the move to securitize as a risk is
that it may become accepted. Ironically, framing an escalation in enmity
as possible but dangerous is precisely what may legitimize such a move
in the eyes of risk-insensitive actors. This is Huysmans' (2002) now
familiar normative dilemma of writing security. The indeterminacy of
language means that political actors may interpret advice in
unpredictable ways. Frustratingly, this may include the precise opposite
of the analyst\'s intention. This situation is likely inescapable, but
it may be mitigated. What I suggest is that analysts should strive to
cultivate a deeper subjectivity of risk sensitivity, comparable to Booth
and Wheeler\'s security-dilemma sensibility, among political actors.

Key to this argument is how visions of the future satisfy the human
desire for certainty. As Berenskoetter argues, "visions depicting the
self in an imagined future order serve as anxiety controlling
mechanisms" (2011, 654). Visions of the future inoculate actors against
the anxiety of uncertainty by providing a narrative of where they are
going and how to get there. Indeed, normative debates on securitization
are already loaded with such visions. The impulse to securitize is
underpinned by a utopian future where the security frame can finally
mobilize a response to an otherwise intractable problem. Conversely, the
impulse to desecuritize is sustained by a dystopian future defined by
unrestrained authoritarian politics. A tragic vision of the future does
something different: it presents a future where the only thing we can
know decisively is that it is indeterminate and attempts to conclusively
control it are vulnerable to failure. The very recognition of
fundamental limits on human freedom (Steele 2007, 281--82) becomes
transformed into a source of ontological security. This tempers the
human need for cognitive closure by reconfiguring it into what Herz
understood as a "fundamentally humble posture toward the value and
precariousness of life" (Sylvest 2008, 442). [An actor with a greater
sensitivity to indeterminacy may still pursue securitizing moves, but
with a cautious awareness that they are volatile acts best pursued
sparingly]{.underline}. [The analyst does not simply educate political
leaders by pointing to the indeterminacy of the world; she seeks to make
political subjects more sensitive toward it by crafting visions of a
precarious future.]{.underline}

Finally, this tragic vision cannot, and should not, escape its own need
for reflexivity. Its scholarly proponents need to engage in their own
process of self-reflection, focusing on how their knowledge and
interests are themselves historically situated. The ethic of restraint
is a value, and not necessarily the value for all historical
circumstances. A recognition of the social construction of security
"facts" must be sobered by a recognition of the social construction of
security "values" (Hamati-Ataya 2012, 685).

New Dual Framework," Uluslararasi Iliskiler, 7-1-2020,

[Despite its strengths and popularity in the last 20 years,
Securitization Theory has **several limitations**, some of which have
already been identified by different scholars]{.underline}. [The most
criticized aspect is its focus on speech acts]{.underline}.16 According
to McDonald, the theory over-emphasizes speech acts while neglecting
other processes or means for communication, such as images and other
visual representations like videos, which also play a significant role
in the process.17 As Möller notes, "[language is only one of the (albeit
the most central) means, through which meaning is
communicated]{.underline}". 18 Moreover, Williams emphasizes the
importance of images by stating that: "Security policies today are
constructed not only with the question of their linguistic legitimation
in mind; they now are increasingly decided upon in relation to
acceptable image-rhetorics." 19 [Addressing these criticisms, several
studies have examined the impact of other means of communication during
the securitization process.]{.underline} 20 In line with this, the dual
framework that is introduced in this article also takes different means
of communication into account in addition to speech acts.

In addition to images and other visual representations, Paris School
[scholars also emphasize the role of the practices of security
professionals,21 arguing that these play a more crucial role than
**discursive practices** in constructing security issues]{.underline}.22
That is, rather than the magical power of speech acts, it is the
institutionalizations and routinizations through repetitions of security
practices that produce security issues. 23 [Moreover, unlike the
Copenhagen School, scholars of the Paris School also focus on the
insecuritizing consequences of the process of securitization by asking
what security does rather than what security is.24 In this way, they
also inquire and focus on the threats that ordinary people face, like
the Welsh School does, with its Emancipatory Security
approach]{.underline}.25 However, the Paris School is also limited since
it overemphasizes micro-level practices and ignores macro-level
decisionmaking with its bottom-up framework.26 [My dual framework
borrows insights from the approach of the Paris School as it takes the
practices of security professionals into account without ignoring the
discursive impact of speech acts of macro-level decision-makers.
Moreover, it also focuses on the insecuritizing consequences of
securitization.]{.underline}

[Another significant limitation of Securitization Theory is the
**inadequate analysis** of the audience]{.underline}. According to
Thierry Balzacq, the role of the audience is underspecified because of
Wæver's reliance on John L. Austin's language theory.27 I [additionally
argue that the overemphasis on speech acts and under-analysis of the
audience(s) in the framework of Securitization Theory derives from the
tendency of the Copenhagen School scholars to see securitization as a
**universal phenomenon**]{.underline}. According to Balzacq, however,
"the success of securitization is highly contingent upon the
securitizing actor's ability to identify the audience's feelings, needs,
and interests...To persuade the audience, the speaker has to tune
his/her language to the audience's experience."28

[Securitization Theory also **fails to adequately analyze** contextual
issues. Balzacq, for example, claims that whereas Securitization Theory
claims that securitization modifies the external context, the opposite
is also true: the contextual issues and audience characteristics also
influence the process and success of securitization.29]{.underline}
According to Matt McDonald, "in developing a universal framework for the
designation or construction of threat through speech acts, the
Securitization Theory ultimately downplays the importance of contextual
factors."30 Attention to these two related limitations, concerning
audience and context, is essential to the dual securitization framework
too. However, I do not elaborate on these in this article since they
have already been discussed by various scholars, and many empirical
studies have already been conducted with a focus on these issues.31

Dillon and Reid's The Liberal Way of War: Killing to Make Life Live,
www.research.kobe-u.ac.jp/gsics-publication/jics/chandler_18-1.pdf

[This is a book about the 'liberal way of war']{.underline}. But [the
liberal referred to in the title remains under theorized]{.underline}.
On several occasions the authors highlight the distinction between the
liberal way of war and the general framing of war in the modern liberal
era as a geo-strategic contestation, taking the territorial state as its
referent object. For Dillon and Reid, 'liberalism never fitted this
model of modern politics and the modern problematization of war very
well'（p.83). They therefore seek to define liberalism and the liberal
way of war as distinct from war in the liberal era. **[The liberal way
of war refers not to real wars and conflicts but to an abstract model of
conflict]{.underline}**, defined as a desire to'remove war from the life
of humanity'which'derives from the way in which liberalism takes the
life of the species as its referent object of politics ─
biopolitics'（p.84）. [In this framing, the liberal nature of war very
much depends on the self-description of the conflict by its
proponents]{.underline}: these range from Gladstone's occupation of
Egypt in the cause of'suffering humanity', to US liberal ideological
constructions of the cause of'freedom'in the Cold War struggle against
the Soviet Union up to Bush and Blair's war on Iraq in the cause of
humanity（p.6）. As the authors state, of course, [wars may be fought on
other grounds than universal humanity: 'liberal states may...also act as
geopolitical sovereign actors as well...and may also have geopolitical
motives]{.underline} for the wars they wage'（p.84）.¶ **[It is clear
from the beginning that the distinctiveness of 'the liberal way of war'
which they seek to explore cannot be more than a fool's
quest]{.underline}**. They assert that they will critically uncover the
paradox of liberal war: why it is that Realist or geostrategic war
accepts the necessity of war but attempts to limit it, while liberals
wish to end war but, to do so, are willing to fight unlimited wars. Yet,
they admit that **[this starting point is already an ideological dead
end]{.underline}** [─ the wars of the twentieth century give the lie to
the idea that there is some distinction between 'unending crusades' and
'limited jousts between rationally calculative political subjects': war
has its own dynamic]{.underline}（p.7). [Nevertheless, Dillon and Reid
press on and seek to go beyond a Schmittian critique]{.underline} to
ground this paradox in the biopolitical'driver'of the liberal way of
rule ─ biopolitics: wars waged under the banner of the human（against
humans）are liberal and, allegedly biopolitical, as human life is
declared to be the referent in need of being secured. [These wars are
alleged to be fought differently to geo-political wars for territory,
because the 'drivers' of war are not territorialized interests but the
biopolitical framings of the needs of the human, how human life can and
should be lived.]{.underline} [Inevitably there are **insuperable
methodological hurdles** to this Sisyphusian task]{.underline}. Already,
[there occurs the first fundamental aporia: how do we tell the
difference between a liberal and non-liberal war?]{.underline} [There
appears to be no way of preventing the category of liberal war from
becoming a lifeless and descriptive one: wars are liberal and fought
biopolitically only if we are told that these are the motives by those
fighting them]{.underline}.¶ **[This separation of liberal ways of war
from territorialised framings of geostrategic contestation makes little
sense]{.underline}** [as a framework for understanding]{.underline}
either liberal rule or liberal ways of [war]{.underline}. In fact, [in
defining liberal war in this way the connection between liberal rule and
war is entirely severed]{.underline}. ['Liberal war may on occasions
also be geopolitical; which is to say that war may be simultaneously
geopolitical as well as biopolitically driven since the imperatives
behind war are never uniform or simple; but what distinguishes the
liberal way of war as liberal are the biopolitical imperatives which
have consistently driven its violent peace-making.'（p.85）Liberal rule
has also resulted in wars for territory or in defence of
territories]{.underline}; nevertheless, a story, of course, could have
been told about how views of the human fitted those of struggles to
command territory. [This is acknowledged, but sits uneasily with the
narrow view of liberal war for species life.]{.underline} If the racial
doctrines of European empires, up to and including the genocidal racism
of the Nazi regime, were also biopolitically driven ─ and the authors,
indeed, write of race as part of the'liberal biopolitics of the
seventeenth century'─ then [it seems difficult to separate a liberal way
of war from allegedly 'non-liberal' wars of territorial
control]{.underline}.¶ It seems clear that Dillon and Reid do not seek
to take the logical step of arguing that the view of the human reflects,
and is reflected by, how the human is ruled and how wars are both
thought and fought. Why? Because for them there is something
suprahistorically unique and distinct about the liberal way of war: a
distinctly liberal view which foregrounds the human as the referent of
security. Therefore, **[a second aporia arises: on what basis is this
specifically 'liberal'?]{.underline}** [It would appear that every form
of rule and of war has at least an implicit view of the 'human' and
through this view of the human the form of rule and the way of war are
rationalized. There is not and cannot be anything specifically 'liberal'
about this]{.underline}. The humanity in need of securing, through war
on other humans, could be formed by Alexander the Great's stoic
cosmopolitan vision, or could be'God's chosen people', 'the master
race', or 'the gains of the proletarian revolution': there is little
doubt that beliefs of what the human is, or could become, were a vital
part of many non-Liberal dispositifs ─ the discourses and practices - of
both rule and war. ¶ **[The key starting assumption, that the liberal
way of war can be isolated from any other - and]{.underline}** its
alleged specific form, of '**[unending violence', explained by its
referent of the human - appears to be]{.underline}** a **[particularly
unproductive]{.underline}** one. [At the level of abstraction at which
Dillon and Reid choose to work, there is very little here that would
help to distinguish between a liberal and a non-liberal way of
war]{.underline}（the asserted purpose of the book）. Of course, what
matters is what this view of the human is. Here [Dillon and
Reid]{.underline} appear to [recognise the limits of their
essentializing approach]{.underline}: ...just as the liberal way of rule
is constantly adapting and changing so also is the liberal way of war.
There is, in that sense, no one liberal way of rule or one liberal way
of war. But there is a fundamental continuity which justifies us
referring to the singular...the fact that each takes the properties of
species existence as its referent object...finding its expression
historically in many changing formations of rule according...to the
changing exigencies and understanding of species being...（p.84）¶
[Rather than understand our forms of post-political rule and
post-territorial war today on their own terms]{.underline} and then
consider to what extent this way of rule and war can be theorized, and
to what extent, if any, Foucault's conception of biopolitics may be of
assistance, [Dillon and Reid start out from the assumption that we live
in a liberal world of rule and war and that therefore both can be
critiqued]{.underline} through the framework developed by Foucault in
his engagement with understanding the rise and transformation of liberal
forms of rule. [In transposing Foucault's critical engagement with
liberal ways of rule to an understanding of liberal ways of war, Dillon
and Reid take a body of historical work about the changing political
nature of liberal rule and transpose it into an essentialised and under
theorized understanding of liberal war.]{.underline} This is no mean
feat; how they manage this accomplishment will be discussed in the next
two sections.

Constructivism helps to understand and navigate the complex ways in
which states as well as influential non-state actors engage with one
another, how they define themselves and others, and how these shape the
boundaries of the world within which they act.48 It helps explain how
norms based on common ideas and values can help promote security and
cooperation, and how significantly different ideologies can lead to
conflict. Constructivism goes a long way in explaining how individuals
and organizations influence policy decisions. [However, **constructivism
alone can't answer all** policy issues. There are **obvious gaps** that
require the application of **realist** and liberalist perspectives to
comprehend modern international relations]{.underline}.49 [**In today's

enough to stand alone]{.underline}.50 Policy makers and senior advisors

examination. As senior advisors, how we choose to explain national
security issues inform the solutions we propose. Because national
security policy is important to the practice of military affairs, it is
paramount that senior military leaders develop a good understanding of
those aspects affecting policy formulation. [Improving this
understanding can **provide a stronger foundation** for senior military
leaders to engage more **effectively** with civilian leaders **on
defense-related policies**]{.underline}. [IR theory helps describe **how
policy makers** see the world and how **this influences policy
making**]{.underline}. [**Theory** influences their **perspectives** and
**inform** their **biases** and thus, deserve study and
analysis.]{.underline} Three predominant schools of thought attempt to
explain the way states behave: realism, liberalism, and constructivism.
In general terms, realism focuses on state power, typically in relation
to other states. For the United States, realist policies can translate
into hegemonic actions designed to maintain preeminence in the world.
Liberalism stresses the emphasis on democratic institutions and economic
interdependence. This can prompt policies designed to maximize
international cooperation through international bodies and trade at the
expense of defense-related capabilities. Constructivism highlights the
influence of shared norms, values, and ideas on state behavior.
Normative policies generally focused on establishing international rules
and norms of behavior states are expected to follow with heavy emphasis
in the diplomatic and legal arenas. [**Theory**, however, **is no
panacea**]{.underline}. [While these theories offer useful frameworks
with which to observe international relations, they tend to either
**overemphasize or underestimate attributes** in state behavior such as
the primacy of power, the importance of interdependence or the necessity
of norms]{.underline}. [Thus, policy making and subsequent execution
relying on **one theory** at the exclusion of others **is
risky**]{.underline}. Senior military officers and policy advisors
cannot be content with simply knowing what policy is. They must
understand what policy does and the mechanisms available to recommend
appropriate and effective policy. Having an understanding of how
perceptions of the world and state behavior affect policy decisions is a
way to do so. [In this regard, IR theory remains **essential** for
**understanding** world events, explaining their causes, assessing their
impacts, and proposing suitable solutions.]{.underline} As Snyder
suggests, "to use the insights of each of the three theoretical
traditions as a check on the irrational exuberance of the others."51
There is utility in theory, but it is the practitioners' role to
determine how they apply. Most importantly, it is the practitioner's job
to make the best use of them in order to advance national goals.

Transatlantic Divide: Why Securitization Has Not Secured a Place in
American IR, Why It Should, and How It Can," Duck of Minerva, 9-18-2015,

Securitization theory has rightly garnered much attention among European
scholars of international relations. Its basic claims are powerful: that
security threats are not given, but require active construction; that
the boundaries of "security" are malleable; that the declaration that a
certain problem lies within the realm of security is itself a productive
political act; and that "security" issues hold a trump card, demanding
disproportionate resources and silencing alternative perspectives.
Securitization thus highlights a familiar, even ubiquitous, political
process that had received little attention in the international
relations or comparative foreign policy literatures. It gave scholars a
theoretical language, if not quite a set of coherent theoretical tools,
with which to make sense of how a diverse set of issues, from migration
to narcotics flows to global climate change, sometimes came to be
treated as matters of national and global security and thereby---and
this is where securitization's critical edge came to the fore---impeded
reasoned political debate. No surprise that, as Jarrod and Eric observe,
securitization has been the focus of so many articles in the EJIR---and
even more in such journals as the Review of International Studies and
Security Dialogue. But [there are (good) substantive and]{.underline}
(not so good) [sociological reasons that **securitization has failed to
gain traction in North America**]{.underline}. First, and [most
important, securitization describes a process but leaves us well short
of (a) a fully specified causal theory that (b) takes proper account of
the politics of rhetorical contestation]{.underline}. According to the
foundational theorists of the Copenhagen School, actors, usually elites,
transform the social order from one of normal, everyday politics into a
Schmittian world of crisis by identifying a dire threat to the political
community. [They conceive of this "securitizing move" in linguistic
terms, as a speech act]{.underline}. As Ole Waever (1995: 55) argues,
"By saying it \[security\], something is done (as in betting, a promise,
naming a ship). . . . \[T\]he word 'security' is the act . . ."
\[emphasis added\]. Securitization is a powerful discursive process that
constitutes social reality. Countless articles and books have traced
this process, and its consequences, in particular policy domains.
[Securitization presents itself as a **causal** account. But its
**mechanisms remain obscure**, as do the **conditions** under which it
operates]{.underline}. Why is speaking security so powerful? [How do
mere words twist and transform the social order? Does the invocation of
security prompt a visceral emotional response? Are speech acts
persuasive, by using well-known tropes to convince audiences that they
must seek protection? Or does securitization operate through the
politics of rhetorical coercion, silencing potential opponents? In
securitization accounts, **speech acts** often seem to be **magical
incantations** that upend normal politics through pathways shrouded in
mystery]{.underline}. [Equally unclear is why **some** securitizing
moves resonate, while others \[are **ignored**\]]{.underline} ~~fall on
deaf ears~~. [Certainly not all attempts to construct threats
succeed]{.underline}, and this is true of both traditional military
concerns as well as "new" security issues. [Both neoconservatives and
structural realists in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[have long insisted that **conflict with China is inevitable**, yet
China has over the last **25 years** been more opportunity than threat
in US political discourse---**despite** these **vigorous and persistent
securitizing moves**]{.underline}. [In very recent years, the balance
has shifted, and the China threat has started to catch on: **linguistic
processes alone cannot account for this change**]{.underline}. The US
military has repeatedly declared that global climate change has profound
implications for national security---but that has hardly cast aside
climate change deniers, many of whom are ironically foreign policy hawks
supposedly deferential to the uniformed military. Authoritative speakers
have varied in the efficacy of their securitizing moves. While George W.
Bush powerfully framed the events of 9/11 as a global war against
American values, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a more gifted orator,
struggled to convince a skeptical public that Germany presented an
imminent threat to the United States. [After thirty years as an active
research program, securitization theory has **hardly begun to offer
acceptable answers** to these questions. **Brief references to
"facilitating conditions" won't cut it**. You don't have to subscribe to
a covering-law conception of theory to find these questions important or
to find securitization's answers unsatisfying]{.underline}. A large part
of the problem, we believe, lies in securitization's silence on the
politics of security. Its foundations in speech act theory have yielded
an oddly apolitical theoretical framework. In its seminal formulation,
the Copenhagen school emphasized the internal linguistic rules that must
be followed for a speech act to be recognized as competent. Yet as
Thierry Balzacq argues, [by treating securitization as a purely
rule-driven process]{.underline}, the Copenhagen school [ignores the
politics of securitization]{.underline}, reducing "security to a
conventional procedure such as marriage or betting in which the
'felicity circumstances' (conditions of success) must fully prevail for
the act to go through" (2005:172). [Absent from this picture are fierce
rhetorical battles, where coalitions counter securitizing moves with
their own appeals that strike more or less deeply at underlying
narratives. Absent as well are the public intellectuals and media, who
question and critique securitizing moves]{.underline} sometimes (and not
others), [sometimes to good effect (and sometimes with little
impact)]{.underline}. [The **audience** itself---whether the mass public
or a narrower elite stratum---is **stripped of all
agency**]{.underline}. [Speaking security, even when the performance is
competent, **does not sweep this politics away**]{.underline}. Only by
delving into this politics can we shed light on the mysteries of
securitization. We see rhetorical politics as constituted less by
singular "securitizing moves" than by "contentious conversation"---to
use Charles Tilly's phrase. To this end, we would urge securitization
theorists, as we recently have elsewhere, to move towards a "pragmatic"
model that rests on four analytical wagers: that actors are both
strategic and social; that legitimation works by imparting meaning to
political action; that legitimation is laced through with contestation;
and that the power of language emerges through contentious dialogue. We
are heartened that our ambivalence about securitization---the ways in
which we find it by turns appealing and dissatisfying---and our vision
for how to move forward have in the last decade been echoed by (mostly)
European colleagues. These critics have laid out a research agenda that
would, if taken up, produce more satisfying, and more deeply political,
theoretical accounts. In our own work, both individual and collective,
we have tried to advance that research agenda. So long as securitization
theorists resist defining the theory's scope and mechanisms, and so long
as it remains wedded to apolitical underpinnings, we think it unlikely
to gain a broad following on this side of the pond. [Second,
securitization has been held back by another way in which it is
apolitical]{.underline}---this time thanks to its Schmittian commitments
and political vision. [Successful securitization, in seminal accounts,
replaces normal patterns of politics with the world of the
exception]{.underline}, in which contest has no place. [They imagine
security as the ultimate trump card. But, in reality, the divide is not
nearly so stark. Security **does not crowd out all other spending
priorities**---or states would spend on nothing but defense and
"securitized" issues. **Nor** does simply declaring something a matter
of national security **guarantee its funding**]{.underline}---or global
climate change counter-measures, including research on renewable
energies, would be well-funded. [Nor are security issues somehow aloof
from politics: politics has never truly stopped "at the water's edge."
Securitization considers only the politics of security. Its strangely
dichotomous optic cannot see or make sense of the politics within
security]{.underline}. In ignoring the politics within security,
securitization is of course in good company. Realists of all stripes
have paid little attention to domestic political contest, except as a
distraction from structural imperatives. But while realism is
unquestionably a powerful first-cut, [this inattention to the politics
within security is also among the reasons so many have found it
wanting]{.underline}. As Arnold Wolfers long ago observed, some degree
of insecurity is the normal state of affairs. But "some may find the
danger to which they are exposed entirely normal and in line with their
modest security expectations while others consider it unbearable to live
with these same dangers." And states, he further argues, do not actually
maximize security---almost ever. "Even when there has been no question
that armaments would mean more security, the cost in taxes, the
reduction in social benefits, or the sheer discomfort involved have
militated effectively against further effort" (1962:151, 153). [A
securitization perspective renders all this politics within security
inexplicable. And yet]{.underline}, as Wolfers saw half a century ago,
[it is crucial]{.underline}.

According to Buzan, Wæver and De Wilde's foundational text of the theory
of securitization, Security: A New Framework for Analysis (1998), [an
issue can be]{.underline} non-politicized (it is not subject to public
debate or policymaking), politicized (it is publicly debated and subject
to policymaking) or [securitized]{.underline} ([it is presented as an
existential threat, authorizing measures outside normal politics to
address it]{.underline}), and 'any issue can end up on any part of the
spectrum' (Buzan et al., 1998: 24). The Copenhagen School model outlines
that [for an issue to be repositioned from the status of non-politicized
or politicized to that of securitized requires an authorized and
responsible actor to name it as an existential security threat to a
particular referent object, and for this 'securitizing move' to be
accepted by the relevant audience of this referent object, the endorsing
of extraordinary measures to address it]{.underline}. In turn,
[desecuritizations are processes 'in which a political community
**downgrades** or **ceases to treat something as an existential threat**
to a valued referent object, and reduces or stops calling for
exceptional measures to deal with the threat']{.underline} (Buzan and
Wæver, cited in Coskun, 2008: 405).

As such, [the key aim of securitization theory is to identify what,
when, where and how an issue is moved from being part of the normal
environment of politics to becoming a threat to security and beyond the
scope of normal politics]{.underline} -- and vice versa
(desecuritization). The Copenhagen School securitization model gained
considerable popularity during the 2000s, and was applied to the
empirical study of a diverse range of security issues, including the War
on Terror (Buzan, 2006), immigration, trafficking and minority rights
(Huysmans, 1998, 2000; Aradau, 2004; Sasse, 2005; Jutila, 2006),
societal insecurity, human rights (Morozov, 2002), environmental
politics, HIV/AIDS (Elbe, 2006) and EU security (Huysmans, 2000;
Balzacq, 2008; Neal, 2009). However, it has also been the subject of a
series of critiques and modifications from both its staunch supporters
and ardent critics. As Ciută notes, this critique has three main
strands: conceptual (structural issues particularly related to speech
act theory and other necessary components of the model); epistemological
(how securitization views contexts); and normative (related to the shift
from securitization speech acts to practices of the political and the
liberal) (Ciută, 2009: 302).

In light of these critiques, a 'second-generation' research agenda
emerged among 'contextual securitization scholars' (Stritzel, 2012:
553), which is concerned with combining the formal aspects of the
securitization model with a greater emphasis on examining the
interrelationship between security politics and the contexts in which it
operates. The aim of this agenda is to 'construct a more comprehensive
understanding of underlying processes' by focusing on the
'socio-linguistic and/or socio-political micro-dynamics of generating
threats' (Stritzel, 2012: 553; see also Balzacq, 2005, 2011; Guzzini,
2011; Salter, 2008; Stritzel, 2007, 2011; McDonald, 2008, 2011).
Mirroring the original debate about the Copenhagen School model, the
initial focus of such second-generation scholarship centred on analysing
securitizing moves, while the inverse process of desecuritizing moves
did not receive much attention (Coskun, 2008: 393). Recently, however,
second-generation [scholars have begun to delve more deeply into what it
means to desecuritize an issue and ask what a desecuritized issue would
look like]{.underline} (see Åtland, 2008; Aradau, 2004; Aras and Polat,
2008; Behnke, 2006; Cui and Li, 2011; Hansen, 2012; Knudsen, 2001; Roe,
2004; Wæver, 1995; Oelsner, 2005; Coskun, 2008; Salter, 2008; Klinke and
Perombelon 2015).

[These efforts have revealed a **lack of basic consensus** on the nature
of desecuritization as a concept, model or process]{.underline}. As
Coskun rightly points out, 'the Copenhagen School does not suggest an
explicit framework for its analysis as it has done for securitization';
'[different scholars have **interpreted** and **implied**
desecuritization **differently**]{.underline}' (Coskun, 2008: 395). [The
notion that to analyse desecuritization is simply to follow the
Copenhagen School securitization model, but in reverse, has **proven
problematic**]{.underline}. Åtland (2008: 292) argues that, as opposed
to securitization, '[desecuritization **does not necessarily happen** as
the result of a "speech act". Rather, there are many other ways that an
issue or issue-area can be moved out of the sphere of security politics
and into the sphere of regular politics'. For many scholars,
desecuritizing moves have come to be considered as the product of a
**wider management process**, rather than a **singular speech act or
debate**]{.underline} (for more on this debate, see Roe, 2004, 2006;
Jutila, 2006).

New Dual Framework," Uluslararasi Iliskiler, 7-1-2020,

[In addition, by focusing on the illocutionary act, securitization is
presented as happening within a single moment rather than as a process
over time]{.underline}. Ole Wæver, for example, argues "the utterance
itself is the act ... by uttering security, a state representative moves
a particular development into a specific area, and thereby claims a
special right to use whatever means to block it."37 [That is,
securitization occurs just within the moment when the speech act is
performed, and the audience has accepted it]{.underline}.38 Although
this Schmittian stance has somewhat changed in the 1998 book39 by
focusing on the securitizing move and the inherent processual nature of
persuasion of the audience, the processual understanding of
securitization is still limited. Still, in this framework of the
Copenhagen School (successful) securitization ends with the persuasion
of a sufficient number of right people and the start of the
extraordinary measures.40 However[, I argue that securitization should
be considered as a process that includes the definition of security,
discursive efforts to convince the audience, security practices that
normalize and routinize the security definition, the clashes between
rival security definitions and arguments, and the insecurities that
result from these security practices.]{.underline} I further argue that
securitization lasts until the issue is fully desecuritized[. It can
further be argued that securitization and desecuritization may occur
simultaneously; some groups may be struggling to securitize an issue,
while others may be working for its desecuritization.]{.underline}

[The main shortcoming of Securitization Theory relevant for the argument
of this study is the lack of the analysis of rival voices]{.underline}.
[Securitization is considered as truth construction]{.underline}. That
is, the Securitizing actor proposes a truth claim and convinces
audiences of this claim. The securitizing actor proposes a security
definition in which s/he describes the threat, legitimate security
provider, referent object, and legitimate means to deal with the issue[.
However, there are always rivals who reject this truth claim or, in most
cases, counter truth claims, and definitions emerge.]{.underline} This a
constant conflict between these truth claims, while constructing
security issues means that a securitization analysis should also examine
these rival voices. [These rival voices may take the form of non-violent
opposition or counter-securitization. To overcome this limitation, a
dual approach is required to examine rival voices in the securitization
process.]{.underline}

[The lack of a dual approach in Securitization Theory means that a
securitization analysis can only problematize one side, namely that of
the securitizing actors, by revealing how they create security issues
and use security discourses to achieve their own aims. In most cases,
this actor is the state or other formal institutions like the
EU.]{.underline} In most cases, however, particularly when
counter-securitization emerges, other securitizing actors are involved
that should also be problematized. These may also use extraordinary or
violent means like the use of force. For example, in the securitization
of a minority group in a country, the state may be the securitizing
actor, which uses extraordinary means as a result of a securitization
process. [However, there may also be a counter-securitization against
the state from within this minority group, and this securitizing actor
may also be using extraordinary means against the state like the use of
force. The sequence of the primary and counter-securitization may also
change. Hence, both primary and counter-securitizations should be
investigated in a comprehensive securitization analysis. However, it
should be stated that there does not have to be a countersecuritization
in all securitization cases. There may also be non-violent opposition
depending on the contextual factors, but I argue that there are always
rival voices in line with the argument of Foucault that "where there is
power there is resistance."41]{.underline}

Marcelo de Araujo, "Moral Enhancement and Political Realism," Journal of
Evolution and Technology, 6-xx-2014, https://jetpress.org/v24/araujo.htm

Some [moral enhancement theorists argue]{.underline} that [a society of
**morally enhanced individuals**]{.underline} [would be in a better
position to cope with important problems that humankind is likely to
face in]{.underline} the future such as, for instance, the threats posed
by **[climate change]{.underline}**, grand scale **[terrorist
attacks]{.underline}**, or the risk of **[catastrophic
wars.]{.underline}** [The assumption here is]{.underline} quite simple:
[our inability to cope successfully with these problems stems mainly
from a sort of deficit in human beings' **moral
motivation**]{.underline}. [If human beings were morally
better]{.underline} -- if we had enhanced moral dispositions -- [there
would be **fewer wars, less terrorism**, and more **willingness to save
our environment**.]{.underline} Although simple and attractive, **[this
assumption is]{.underline}**, as I intend to show,
**[false]{.underline}**. [At the root of threats to the survival of
humankind in the future is not a deficit in our moral
dispositions]{.underline}, [but the endurance of an **old political
arrangement** that prevents the pursuit of shared goals on a collective
basis.]{.underline} The political arrangement I have in mind here is the
international system of states. In my analysis of the political
implications of moral enhancement, I intend to concentrate my attention
only on the supposition that we could avoid major wars in the future by
making individuals morally better. I do not intend to discuss the
threats posed by climate change, or by terrorism, although some human
enhancement theorists also seek to cover these topics. I will explain,
in the course of my analysis, a conceptual distinction between "human
nature realism" and "structural realism," well-known in the field of
international relations theory. Thomas Douglas seems to have been among
the first to explore the idea of "moral enhancement" as a new form of
human enhancement. He certainly helped to kick off the current phase of
the debate. In a paper published in 2008, Douglas suggests that in the
"future people might use biomedical technology to morally enhance
themselves." Douglas characterizes moral enhancement in terms of the
acquisition of "morally better motives" (Douglas 2008, 229). Mark
Walker, in a paper published in 2009, suggests a similar idea. He
characterizes moral enhancement in terms of improved moral dispositions
or "genetic virtues": The Genetic Virtue Program (GVP) is a proposal for
influencing our moral nature through biology, that is, it is an
alternate yet complementary means by which ethics and ethicists might
contribute to the task of making our lives and world a better place. The
basic idea is simple enough: genes influence human behavior, so altering
the genes of individuals may alter the influence genes exert on
behavior. (Walker 2009, 27--28) Walker does not argue in favor of any
specific moral theory, such as, for instance, virtue ethics. Whether one
endorses a deontological or a utilitarian approach to ethics, he argues,
the concept of virtue is relevant to the extent that virtues motivate us
either to do the right thing or to maximize the good (Walker 2009, 35).
Moral enhancement theory, however, does not reduce the ethical debate to
the problem of moral dispositions. Morality also concerns, to a large
extent, questions about reasons for action. And moral enhancement, most
certainly, will not improve our moral beliefs; neither could it be used
to settle moral disagreements. This seems to have led some authors to
criticize the moral enhancement idea on the ground that it neglects the
cognitive side of our moral behavior. Robert Sparrow, for instance,
argues that, from a Kantian point of view, moral enhancement would have
to provide us with better moral beliefs rather than enhanced moral
motivation (Sparrow 2014, 25; see also Agar 2010, 74). Yet, it seems to
me that this objection misses the point of the moral enhancement idea.
[Many people, across different countries, already share moral beliefs
relating]{.underline}, for instance, [to the wrongness of harming or
killing other people arbitrarily,]{.underline} or to the moral
requirement to help people in need. They may share moral beliefs while
not sharing the same reasons for these beliefs, or perhaps even not
being able to articulate the beliefs in the conceptual framework of a
moral theory (Blackford 2010, 83). But although they share some moral
beliefs, in some circumstances they may lack the appropriate motivation
to act accordingly. Moral enhancement, thus, aims at improving moral
motivation, and leaves open the question as to how to improve our moral
judgments. In a recent paper, published in The Journal of Medical
Ethics, neuroscientist Molly Crockett reports the state of the art in
the still very embryonic field of moral enhancement. She points out, for
example, that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
citalopram seems to increase harm aversion. There is, moreover, some
evidence that this substance may be effective in the treatment of
specific types of aggressive behavior. Like Douglas, Crockett emphasizes
that moral enhancement should aim at individuals' moral motives
(Crockett 2014; see also Spence 2008; Terbeck et al. 2013). Another
substance that is frequently mentioned in the moral enhancement
literature is oxytocin. Some [studies suggest that willingness to
cooperate with other people]{.underline},and to trust unknown
prospective cooperators, [may be enhanced by an increase in the levels
of oxytoci]{.underline}n in the organism (Zak 2008, 2011; Zak and Kugler
2011; Persson and Savulescu 2012, 118--119). Oxytocin has also been
reported to be "associated with the subjective experience of empathy"
(Zak 2011, 55; Zak and Kugler 2011, 144). The question I would like to
examine now concerns the supposition that moral enhancement --
comprehended in these terms and assuming for the sake of argument that,
some day, it might become effective and safe -- may also help us in
coping with the threat of devastating wars in the future. [The
assumption that there is a relationship between,]{.underline} on the one
hand, [threats to the survival of humankind and]{.underline}, on the
other, [a sort of "deficit" in our moral dispositions is
c]{.underline}learly [made by]{.underline} some [moral enhancements
theorists]{.underline}. Douglas, for instance, argues that "according to
many plausible theories, some of the world's most important problems ---
such as developing world poverty, climate change and war --- can be
attributed to these moral deficits" (2008, 230). Walker, in a similar
vein, writes about the possibility of "using biotechnology to alter our
biological natures in an effort to reduce evil in the world" (2009, 29).
And Julian Savulescu and Ingmar Persson go as far as to defend the "the
need for moral enhancement" of humankind in a series of articles, and in
a book published in 2012. One of the reasons Savulescu and Persson
advance for the moral enhancement of humankind is that our moral
dispositions seem to have remained basically unchanged over the last
millennia (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 2). These dispositions have
proved thus far quite useful for the survival of human beings as a
species. They have enabled us to cooperate with each other in the
collective production of things such as food, shelter, tools, and
farming. They have also played a crucial role in the creation and
refinement of a variety of human institutions such as settlements,
villages, and laws. Although the possibility of free-riding has never
been fully eradicated, the benefits provided by cooperation have largely
exceeded the disadvantages of our having to deal with occasional
uncooperative or untrustworthy individuals (Persson and Savulescu 2012,
39). The problem, however, is that the same dispositions that have
enabled human beings in the past to engage in the collective production
of so many artifacts and institutions now seem powerless in the face of
the human capacity to destroy other human beings on a grand scale, or
perhaps even to annihilate the entire human species. There is, according
to Savulescu and Persson, a "mismatch" between our cognitive faculties
and our evolved moral attitudes: "\[...\] as we have repeatedly
stressed, owing to the progress of science, the range of our powers of
action has widely outgrown the range of our spontaneous moral attitudes,
and created a dangerous mismatch" (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 103; see
also Persson and Savulescu 2010, 660; Persson and Savulescu 2011b;
DeGrazie 2012, 2; Rakić 2014, 2). This worry about the mismatch between,
on the one hand, the modern technological capacity to destroy and, on
the other, our limited moral commitments is not new. The political
philosopher Hans Morgenthau, best known for his defense of political
realism, called attention to the same problem nearly fifty years ago. In
the wake of the first successful tests with thermonuclear bombs,
conducted by the USA and the former Soviet Union, Morgenthau referred to
the "contrast" between the technological progress of our age and our
feeble moral attitudes as one of the most disturbing dilemmas of our
time: The first dilemma consists in the contrast between the
technological unification of the world and the parochial moral
commitments and political institutions of the age. Moral commitments and
political institutions, dating from an age which modern technology has
left behind, have not kept pace with technological achievements and,
hence, are incapable of controlling their destructive potentialities.
(Morgenthau 1962, 174) Moral enhancement theorists and political
realists like Morgenthau, therefore, share the thesis that our natural
moral dispositions are not strong enough to prevent human beings from
endangering their own existence as a species. But they differ as to the
best way out of this quandary: moral enhancement theorists argue for the
re-engineering of our moral dispositions, whereas Morgenthau accepted
the immutability of human nature and argued, instead, for the
re-engineering of world politics. Both positions, as I intend to show,
are wrong in assuming that the "dilemma" results from the weakness of
our spontaneous moral dispositions in the face of the unprecedented
technological achievements of our time. On the other hand, [both
positions are correct in recognizing the **real possibility** of global
catastrophes resulting from the malevolent use of, for instance,
**biotechnology or nuclear capabilities.**]{.underline} The supposition
that individuals' unwillingness to cooperate with each other, even when
they would be better-off by choosing to cooperate, results from a sort
of deficit of dispositions such as altruism, empathy, and benevolence
has been at the core of some important political theories. This idea is
an important assumption in the works of early modern political realists
such as Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes. It was also later endorsed by
some well-known authors writing about the origins of war in the first
half of the twentieth century. It was then believed, as Sigmund Freud
suggested in a text from 1932, that the main cause of wars is a human
tendency to "hatred and destruction" (in German: ein Trieb zum Hassen
und Vernichtung). [Freud went as far as to suggest that human beings
have an ingrained "inclination" to "aggression" and
"destruction"]{.underline} (Aggressionstrieb, Aggressionsneigung, and
Destruktionstrieb), and that this inclination has a "good biological
basis" (biologisch wohl begründet) (Freud 1999, 20--24; see also Freud
1950; Forbes 1984; Pick 1993, 211--227; Medoff 2009). The [attempt to
employ Freud's conception of human nature in understanding international
relations has recently been resumed]{.underline}, for instance by Kurt
Jacobsen in a paper entitled "Why Freud Matters: Psychoanalysis and
International Relations Revisited," published in 2013. Morgenthau
himself was deeply influenced by Freud's speculations on the origins of
war.1 Early in the 1930s, Morgenthau wrote an essay called "On the
Origin of the Political from the Nature of Human Beings" (Über die
Herkunft des Politischen aus dem Wesen des Menschen), which contains
several references to Freud's theory about the human propensity to
aggression.2 Morgenthau's most influential book, Politics among Nations:
The Struggle for Power and Peace, first published in 1948 and then
successively revised and edited, is still considered a landmark work in
the tradition of political realism. According to Morgenthau, politics is
governed by laws that have their origin in human nature: "Political
realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by
objective laws that have their roots in human nature" (Morgenthau 2006,
4). Just like human enhancement theorists, Morgenthau also takes for
granted that human nature has not changed over recent millennia: "Human
nature, in which the laws of politics have their roots, has not changed
since the classical philosophies of China, India, and Greece endeavored
to discover these laws" (Morgenthau 2006, 4). And since, for Morgenthau,
human nature prompts human beings to act selfishly, rather than
cooperatively, political leaders will sometimes favor conflict over
cooperation, unless some superior power compels them to act otherwise.
Now, this is exactly what happens in the domain of international
relations. For in the international sphere there is not a supranational
institution with the real power to prevent states from pursuing means of
self-defense. The acquisition of means of self-defense, however, is
frequently perceived by other states as a threat to their own security.
This leads to the security dilemma and the possibility of war. As
Morgenthau put the problem in an article published in 1967: "The actions
of states are determined not by moral principles and legal commitments
but by considerations of interest and power" (1967, 3). Because
Morgenthau and early modern political philosophers such as Machiavelli
and Hobbes defended political realism on the grounds provided by a
specific conception human nature, their version of political realism has
been frequently called "human nature realism." The literature on human
nature realism has become quite extensive (Speer 1968; Booth 1991;
Freyberg-Inan 2003; Kaufman 2006; Molloy 2006, 82--85; Craig 2007;
Scheuerman 2007, 2010, 2012; Schuett 2007; Neascu 2009; Behr 2010,
210--225; Brown 2011; Jütersonke 2012). It is not my intention here to
present a fully-fledged account of the tradition of human nature
realism, but rather to emphasize the extent to which some moral
enhancement theorists, in their description of some of the gloomy
scenarios humankind is likely to face in the future, implicitly endorse
this kind of political realism. Indeed, like human nature realists,
moral enhancement theorists assume that human nature has not changed
over the last millennia, and that violence and lack of cooperation in
the international sphere result chiefly from human nature's limited
inclination to pursue morally desirable goals. One may, of course,
criticize the human enhancement project by rejecting the assumption that
conflict and violence in the international domain should be explained by
means of a theory about human nature. In a reply to Savulescu and
Persson, [Sparrow correctly argues that **"structural issues,"** rather
than **human nature**, constitute the main factor underlying political
conflicts]{.underline} (Sparrow 2014, 29). But he does not explain what
exactly these "structural issues" are, as I intend to do later. Sparrow
is right in rejecting the human nature theory underlying the human
enhancement project. But this underlying assumption, in my view, is not
trivially false or simply "ludicrous," as he suggests. Human nature
realism has been implicitly or explicitly endorsed by leading political
philosophers ever since Thucydides speculated on the origins of war in
antiquity (Freyberg-Inan 2003, 23--36). True, it might be objected that
"human nature realism," as it was defended by Morgenthau and earlier
political philosophers, relied upon a metaphysical or psychoanalytical
conception of human nature, a conception that, actually, did not have
the support of any serious scientific investigation (Smith 1983, 167).
Yet, over the last few years there has been much empirical research in
fields such as developmental psychology and evolutionary biology that
apparently gives some support to the realist claim. Some of these
studies suggest that an inclination to aggression and conflict has its
origins in our evolutionary history. This idea, then, has recently led
some authors to resume "human nature realism" on new foundations, devoid
of the metaphysical assumptions of the early realists, and entirely
grounded in empirical research. Indeed, some recent works in the field
of international relations theory already seek to call attention to
evolutionary biology as a possible new start for political realism. This
point is clearly made, for instance, by Bradley Thayer, who published in
2004 a book called Darwin and International Relations: On the
Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict. And in a paper
published in 2000, he affirms the following: Evolutionary theory
provides a stronger foundation for realism because it is based on
science, not on theology or metaphysics. I use the theory to explain two
human traits: egoism and domination. I submit that the egoistic and
dominating behavior of individuals, which is commonly described as
"realist," is a product of the evolutionary process. I focus on these
two traits because they are critical components of any realist argument
in explaining international politics. (Thayer 2000, 125; see also Thayer
2004) Thayer basically argues that a tendency to egoism and domination
stems from human evolutionary history. The predominance of conflict and
competition in the domain of international politics, he argues, is a
reflex of dispositions that can now be proved to be part of our evolved
human nature in a way that Morgenthau and other earlier political
philosophers could not have established in their own time. Now, what
some moral enhancement theorists propose is a direct intervention in our
"evolved limited moral psychology" as a means to make us "fit" to cope
with some possible devastating consequences from the predominance of
conflict and competition in the domain of international politics
(Persson and Savulescu 2010, 664). Moral enhancement theorists
comprehend the nature of war and conflicts, especially those conflicts
that humankind is likely to face in the future, as the result of human
beings' limited moral motivations. Compared to supporters of human
nature realism, however, moral enhancement theorists are less skeptical
about the prospect of our taming human beings' proclivity to do evil.
For our knowledge in fields such as neurology and pharmacology does
already enable us to enhance people's performance in a variety of
activities, and there seems to be no reason to assume it will not enable
us to enhance people morally in the future. But [the
question]{.underline}, of course, is [whether moral enhancement
will]{.underline} also [improve the prospect of our coping
successfully]{.underline} [with]{.underline} some major threats to the
**[survival of humankind]{.underline}**, as Savulescu and Persson
propose, or **[to reduce evil in the world]{.underline}**, as proposed
by Walker. V. The point to which I would next like to call attention is
that "human nature realism" -- which is implicitly presupposed by some
moral enhancement theorists -- has been much criticized over the last
decades within the tradition of political realism itself. "Structural
realism," unlike "human nature realism," does not seek to derive a
theory about conflicts and violence in the context of international
relations from a theory of the moral shortcomings of human nature.
Structural realism was originally proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the
State and War, published in 1959, and then later in another book called
Theory of International Politics, published in 1979. In both works,
Waltz seeks to avoid committing himself to any specific conception of
human nature (Waltz 2001, x--xi). Waltz's thesis is that the thrust of
the political realism doctrine can be retained without our having to
commit ourselves to any theory about the shortcomings of human nature.
What is relevant for our understanding of international politics is,
instead, our understanding of the "structure" of the international
system of states (Waltz 1986). John Mearsheimer, too, is an important
contemporary advocate of political realism. Although he seeks to
distance himself from some ideas defended by Waltz, he also rejects
human nature realism and, like Waltz, refers to himself as a supporter
of "structural realism" (Mearsheimer 2001, 20). One of the basic tenets
of political realism (whether "human nature realism" or "structural
realism") is, first, that the [states are the]{.underline} main, if not
the **[only, relevant actors]{.underline}** in the context of
international relations; [and]{.underline} second, that states
**[compete for power]{.underline}** in the international arena. **[Moral
considerations]{.underline}** in international affairs, according to
realists, [are **secondary**]{.underline} [when set against the state's
primary goal]{.underline}, **[namely its own security and
survival]{.underline}**. But while human nature realists such as
Morgenthau explain the struggle for power as a result of human beings'
natural inclinations, structural realists like Waltz and Mearsheimer
argue that conflicts in the international arena do not stem from human
nature, but from the very "structure" of the international system of
states (Mearsheimer 2001, 18). According to Waltz and Mearsheimer, [it
is this **structure** that compels individuals to act as they do in the
domain of international affairs.]{.underline} And one distinguishing
feature of the international system of states is [its "anarchical
structure,"]{.underline} i.e. the lack of a central government analogous
to the central governments that exist in the context of domestic
politics. [It means that each individual state is responsible for its
own integrity and survival]{.underline}. [In the absence of a superior
authority]{.underline}, over and above the power of each sovereign
state, [political leaders]{.underline} often [feel compelled to favor
**security over morality**]{.underline}, even if, all other things being
considered, they would naturally be more inclined to trust and to
cooperate with political leaders of other states. On the other hand,
when political leaders do trust and cooperate with other states, it is
not necessarily their benevolent nature that motivates them to be
cooperative and trustworthy, but, again, it is the structure of the
system of states that compels them. The concept of human nature, as we
can see, does not play a decisive role here. Because Waltz and
Mearsheimer depart from "human nature realism," their version of
political realism has also sometimes been called "neo-realism" (Booth
1991, 533). Thus, **[even if]{.underline}** [human beings turn out to
become **morally enhanced**]{.underline} in the future, [humankind may
still have to face the same **scary scenarios**]{.underline} described
by some moral enhancement theorists. [This is likely to happen if,
indeed]{.underline}, [human beings remain compelled to
cooperate]{.underline} within the present structure of the system of
states. Consider, for instance, the incident with a Norwegian weather
rocket in January 1995. Russian radars detected a missile that was
initially suspected of being on its way to reach Moscow in five minutes.
All levels of Russian military defense were immediately put on alert for
a possible imminent attack and massive retaliation. It is reported that
for the first time in history a Russian president had before him, ready
to be used, the "nuclear briefcase" from which the permission to launch
nuclear weapons is issued. And that happened when the Cold War was
already supposed to be over! In the event, it was realized that the
rocket was leaving Russian territory and Boris Yeltsin did not have to
enter the history books as the man who started the third world war by
mistake (Cirincione 2008, 382).3 But [under the crushing pressure of
having to decide in such a short time, and on the basis of unreliable
information, whether or not to retaliate, even a morally enhanced
Yeltsin might have given orders to launch a devastating nuclear
response]{.underline} -- and that **[in spite of strong moral
dispositions to the contrary.]{.underline}** Writing for The Guardian on
the basis of recently declassified documents, Rupert Myers reports
further incidents similar to the one of 1995. He suggests that as more
states strive to acquire nuclear capability, the danger of a major
nuclear accident is likely to increase (Myers 2014). [What has to be
changed]{.underline}, therefore, [is not human moral
dispositions]{.underline}, **[but the very structure of the political
international system of states]{.underline}** within which we currently
live. As far as major threats to the survival of humankind are
concerned, moral enhancement might play an important role in the future
only to the extent that it will help humankind to change the structure
of the system of states. While [moral enhancement]{.underline} may
possibly have desirable results in some areas of human cooperation that
do not badly threaten our security -- such as donating food, medicine,
and money to poorer countries -- it [will not motivate political leaders
to **dismantle their nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. [Neither will it
deter other political leaders from pursuing nuclear
capability]{.underline}, [at any rate not as long as the structure of
international politics compels them to see prospective cooperators **in
the present as possible enemies in the future.**]{.underline} The idea
of a "structure" should not be understood here in metaphysical terms, as
though it mysteriously existed in a transcendent world and had the
magical power of determining leaders' decisions in this world. The word
"structure" denotes merely a political arrangement in which there are no
powerful law-enforcing institutions. And [in the absence of the kind of
security that law-enforcing institutions have the force to
create]{.underline}, [political leaders will]{.underline} often **[fail
to cooperate,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} occasionally [engage
in]{.underline} conflicts and [wars]{.underline}, [in those areas that
are critical to their]{.underline} security and [survival]{.underline}.
Given the structure of international politics and the basic goal of
survival, [this is likely to continue to happen]{.underline}, **[even
if,]{.underline}** in the future, political [leaders become **less
egoistic and power-seeking**]{.underline} through moral enhancement. On
the other hand, since the structure of the international system of
states is itself another human institution, there is no reason to
suppose that it cannot ever be changed. If people become morally
enhanced in the future they may possibly feel more strongly motivated to
change the structure of the system of states, or perhaps even feel
inclined to abolish it altogether. In my view, however, [addressing
major threats to the survival of humankind in the future by means of
**bioengineering**]{.underline} [is unlikely to yield the **expected
results**, so long as moral enhancement is pursued **within the present
framework of the international system of states.**]{.underline}

Dillon Tatum, "Toward a Radical IR," Duck of Minerva, 11-28-2018,
http://duckofminerva.com/2018/11/toward-a-radical-ir.html

David Brook's latest column in the New York Times, banging on the same
themes about "the kids are just not right," raises some questions about
[what it means to engage in radical politics in the Trump
era]{.underline}. Brooks compares [the]{.underline} younger generation's
[belief "that the system itself is rotten and needs to be **torn
down**"]{.underline} to accomodationist and gradualisms. He continues on
to speculate about how these new attitudes might affect older, more
"pragmatic," liberals who desire to work within the system. Brooks, as
usual, uses a conservative argument to position himself in the "middle."
[I have been thinking]{.underline} a lot [about this issue of
**"radicalism"** contra arguments about **working within systems** that
are unjust in thinking about liberal world order and its
futures]{.underline}. It has led me to a question [I am]{.underline}
currently [exploring]{.underline} in a work-in-progress about what [the
possibilities]{.underline} are [of radicalism as a way of approaching
international politics]{.underline}. Against arguments like Brooks', and
even more sophisticated arguments about agonistic democracy developed by
thinkers like Chantal Mouffe, I think [there is a **place in IR** for
radical conceptions of transformation, order, and politics]{.underline}.
[What is radicalism?]{.underline} Brooks never fully fleshes out this
concept. [Philosophy and political theory have engaged with the issue of
radicalism as a concept, though the results are often
divergent]{.underline}. To quote Agnes Heller, in her treatise on
[radical philosophy]{.underline}, it "[can give the world a norm, and it
can will people to want to give a world to the norm]{.underline}."
[Radicalism as an idea, and as a form of critique, mobilizes many
different modes of thinking about the social and the
political]{.underline}. The most comprehensive definition of radicalism
is that provided by Paul [McLaughlin]{.underline}, who [defines
radicalism]{.underline} "[in terms of]{.underline} (i) [a fundamental
orientation]{.underline} (toward fundamental objects) (ii) [in the
political domain]{.underline} (iii) [of an argumentative
nature]{.underline}." More than that, though, we can add that
[radicalism intervenes in the political domain with the goal of
fundamental transformation]{.underline}. Additionally, [though
radicalism]{.underline} indeed [proceeds in an **argumentative nature**,
this methodology for argument is one that is aimed at critiquing, and
seeking the destruction/replacement of existing
institutions]{.underline}. [A revised]{.underline} working [definition
of radicalism]{.underline}, therefore, [is: a way of thinking about
politics that focuses on totalities, **praxis** and **political
action**, and the deployment of historicist methods with an eye toward
"getting to the root of things."]{.underline} Thus, [radicalism is both
a broad range of critical thought and practice, but also is specific in
the realms of focus, **action**, and method]{.underline}. If Brooks is
right that there is a major clash between a radical younger generation
and a more pragmatic and moderate older generation in American politics,
these differences are not well expressed in contemporary thinking about
IR. [Some of the biggest divisions are between]{.underline} what Robert
Cox called **["problem-solving theories"]{.underline}** [and theories
that **critique** such approaches, but provide little argumentation
aimed at tearing structures of injustice down altogether]{.underline}.
[In short: IR, **even at its critical ends**, **is not
radical**]{.underline} (for an excellent exception see here and here).
[Why is this important?]{.underline} This morning, I taught a seminar on
the question "Is Liberal World Order Finished?" [I asked my students to
think about what makes a liberal order "liberal," and then asked: "Can
we fix the liberal world order, or can we imagine a world without
it**?**]{.underline}---[and **what would that look like?**]{.underline}"
[The students were quick to point out the violences, inequities, and
problems inherent in a liberal world order, **but**]{.underline} [it
took a good bit of pushing and prodding to get them to articulate
**whether**/**how** we **should**/**could** take this order apart and
rethink it]{.underline}. [This was not just a difficult task for the
students---it is something IR has not spent enough time meditating
on]{.underline}. [There is a lot to be critical of these
days]{.underline}. And, I disagree with Brooks's pessimism about a
younger radical generation. [Politics is deeply intertwined with
engagements with radicalism]{.underline}. [What]{.underline} I think [is
**missing**]{.underline} [when we consider global politics]{.underline},
though, [is that many of our pressing questions about institutions,
order, and state action proceed from the same sort of moderation,
accomodationism, or---at the most---an immanently critical
vein]{.underline}. If [we want to intellectually and politically
approach issues]{.underline} like: **[What do we make of the future(s)
of liberal world order?]{.underline}** IR needs to engage with
radicalism.

Recent events in Ukraine have once again proved that reports of NATO's
death are an exaggeration. Many leaders across the alliance have been
quick to respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with aid to Kyiv,
increases in their own country's defense budgets, or both. But [as the
war grinds on and the **geopolitical reality** of an **adversarial
relationship** with Russia sets in, NATO must once again take the
**longer view** on]{.underline} what all this means for [trans-Atlantic
and global security.]{.underline}

Conveniently, in less than two months, NATO leaders will meet in Madrid
to endorse the alliance's new strategy. The key question, therefore, is
whether member states will use the moment to reforge NATO's raison
d'être to meet current and future challenges---in particular, by naming
Russia as a threat to the alliance itself. Given the implications of
Ukraine for European and global order, **[the stakes could hardly be
higher.]{.underline}**

[Some take the view that Madrid should mark a reprioritization of U.S.
efforts away from Europe]{.underline} and back toward Asia. Their logic
goes that not only is European defense spending increasing, but Russia
has also demonstrated ineptitude in the prosecution of its war in
Ukraine. That means the longer-term need for significant U.S. forces in
Europe has also therefore declined. And, after all, China is the pacing
threat for Department of Defense planning.

[In fact, **the opposite is true**.]{.underline} For starters, Russian
President Vladimir [Putin has made it **abundantly clear** that **he
views NATO** as a **strategic threat**. Recent events suggest we should
**take these statements** **at face value**. In the runup to the current
war, some analysts developed **elaborate rationales** for why the
buildup of Russian forces]{.underline} on the Ukrainian border [didn't
mean]{.underline} an [invasion]{.underline} was coming, such as a
strengthened negotiating position vis-à-vis Ukraine's future political
directions. [Another Russian invasion of Ukraine was **so**
**obviously** strategically counterproductive that there must have been
another reason for the buildup. **In the event, there
wasn't.**]{.underline}

And [while Russian military incompetence has been startling, planners
**shouldn't leap to conclusions**. Russian forces]{.underline} were not
able to capture Kyiv, but they [have been able to seize tens of
thousands of square miles of territory]{.underline} along Ukraine's
eastern border---at least for now. [Estonia]{.underline}, a Baltic NATO
member that borders Russia, [is less than 20,000 square
miles]{.underline} in size. [Militaries can also reform]{.underline},
especially after disaster, as Ukraine's own army did after its failures
in 2014.

[The United States has **good reasons** to want to **keep NATO
vibrant**: The **strategic benefits** of U.S. leadership are
**manifold**. Not only does American leadership]{.underline} in NATO
[provide pathways for **organizing military coalitions**, but it also
affords the United States privileged status on **trade partnerships**
and **access to bases**. If Putin **achieves his aim** of **discrediting
NATO**, this could lead to trans-Atlantic **strategic insolvency**: a
situation whereby allies]{.underline}, including the United States, [are
**unable** to meet their **security obligations**]{.underline} and,
relatedly, maintain favorable standards of living for their populations.

Which brings us back to Madrid. [The last time that NATO agreed on a
strategic concept was in 2010]{.underline}. It is a document that
specified that, among other things, defense of allied territory remains
a critical mission for the alliance, but it is silent on naming
nation-state threats to NATO. For a variety of domestic and
international political reasons, building formal consensus on threats
among 30 allied states is extremely challenging. Indeed, [in the 2010
document Russia is **viewed as an aspirational partner** for
NATO]{.underline} when it comes to European security---[despite the
**warning sign** of Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia. In the
intervening years, Russia has conducted **destabilizing disinformation
campaigns**]{.underline} in NATO states [and]{.underline} has
[**attacked Ukraine twice**.]{.underline} And while NATO leaders have
condemned Russian aggression, the rhetoric falls short of formally
declaring Russia as a long-term strategic threat to the alliance.

[**Durable consensus requires clarity**. To **prepare NATO** to contend
with this threat over the long term requires a **frank admission** of
the **strategic realities that Russia poses**]{.underline} in the
alliance's new strategic concept, to be adopted in Madrid. As a
practical matter, this will commit NATO members to take budgeting, force
planning, acquisition, and possible troop repositioning seriously---and
put teeth into the declaration. This is needed for NATO planners to
determine, for example, whether spending 2 percent of GDP on defense is
sufficient to meet the challenges to the alliance.

But the real value of the document is what the collective members
reaffirm as to what NATO continues to stand for, what it calls out as
the threats to the member territory, and what it intends to do to
address, deter, and, if necessary, defend against these threats. [By
stating up front that **Russia is a**]{.underline} formal [**threat**,
member states]{.underline}---and the alliance as a whole---[will find it
**harder to backslide** from their **current cohesion**. It is
**difficult to overstate** how important it is for NATO to ensure its
**consensus is durable**]{.underline}; as the war grinds on and publics
begin feeling the economic effects of the conflict and sanctions on
Russia, [the temptation to dilute support]{.underline} to Ukraine [will
undoubtedly mount]{.underline}. Not to mention, [**calling it like it
is** will **send an important message** to Putin: **NATO will not be
deterred**.]{.underline}

[**Words matter.** It is time]{.underline} for NATO leaders
[to]{.underline} formally [**accept reality**: **Putin is a threat to
the alliance and its members**]{.underline}, and, therefore, they should
declare so in the news strategic concept. Indeed, **[not declaring
Russia a]{.underline}** formal **[threat]{.underline}** to NATO
territory [would **compromise NATO's credibility** and would **give
Putin a pass** for the atrocities and violations]{.underline} he has
committed [in Ukraine. Neither NATO nor the United States can **afford
to allow that** to happen.]{.underline}

[A common thread running through the entire post-1945 period is that
people **don't want to think about nuclear war**. When they're
**forced**]{.underline} [to think of it]{.underline}, when they can't
escape it, [they]{.underline} [**want to stop it**. But when it's not in
the **headlines**]{.underline} any more and governments are growing more
reasonable, [they'd]{.underline} **[just as well not]{.underline}**
think about it. If nuclear war did break out today, you can bet more
people would focus on it, but, of course, we don't want that war to have
to take place. [The peace movement's challenge is to maintain
its]{.underline} **[momentum and sense of danger]{.underline}** [---
even though the world might]{.underline} **[seem]{.underline}** [safer
and there are fewer nuclear weapons in the world. If the nations of the
world are **maintaining their arsenals**, the struggle]{.underline}
**[hasn't come to an end.]{.underline}** Do you think [the moment we're
experiencing today with]{.underline} **[Trump]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[North Korea]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[potentially]{.underline}** [a driving force for]{.underline}
**[another peak]{.underline}** [of movement **energy**?]{.underline}
What's different today? It's possible that there will be some revival of
the nuclear disarmament movement, [but we]{.underline} **[haven't
seen]{.underline}** [the surge of resistance **yet**.]{.underline} I'm a
co-chair of the national board of the group Peace Action, so I'm very
well aware of how peace groups are doing. While Peace Action isn't doing
badly, we're certainly not yet experiencing the surge of action in the
streets, such as when its predecessors, SANE and the Nuclear Freeze
Campaign, were taking off. One reason it's not taking place is that the
mass media rarely focus on the danger of nuclear war, and when they do
focus on it, it's the danger of some other country waging war on the
United States. One day it's Iran, another day it's North Korea --- but
they don't seem to get to the basic problem that nine countries have
15,000 nuclear weapons in their arsenals. It's a worldwide phenomenon,
as is the persistence of the idea of nuclear weapons as the ultimate
guarantor of national security. Right now there's also a sense that only
Koreans are vulnerable, that most Americans aren't at risk of being
bombarded by nuclear missiles. At the height of popular protest in the
1980s, millions of people were in the streets --- in part because U.S.
and Soviet arsenals could reach both sides quite easily. That got people
to wake up and realize that nuclear war wasn't such a hot idea after
all. How big a role did fear play in these spikes of organizing? How can
people dealing with fear of the Trump administration, or of North Korean
nuclear mobilization, help direct that energy into making nuclear
conflict less likely? I think [fear has probably been]{.underline}
**[the most important factor in mobilizing people.]{.underline}** When
you look at things psychologically, people should be afraid of nuclear
weapons and nuclear war. It seems irrational to go bury your head in the
sand and not worry about them. But it's also true, in two ways, that
fear is dangerous. One is that it can be demobilizing, that people get
so scared they're scared silent. They become so frightened they retreat
and they don't feel powerful any more. They might take drugs instead of
taking action. A second danger is that, if people are scared of nuclear
war, the hawks have an answer for them. They turn fear on its head: Yes,
they say, nuclear war could be a bad thing, that's why we need nuclear
weapons to deter the bad Russians, Iranians, North Koreans and so on.
This means fear may reinforce the desire for nuclear weapons rather than
for getting rid of them. [For these reasons, the use of nuclear fear has
to be]{.underline} very [**careful**. Peace activists have to make the
case that **as long as nuc**lear weapon**s exist there's no real
security from nuclear war**, and therefore we need to **get rid of
nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. That's the best case that can be made by
nuclear disarmament forces: The arms race is a race no one wins. What
are some of the forgotten "paths not taken" of weapons not built or
decisions not made as a result of anti-nuclear organizing? How might the
world be different if those things had been built? The neutron bomb was
being proposed during the Carter administration. This enhanced radiation
weapon was designed to destroy people rather than property, and was
scheduled by the Carter administration to be deployed in Western
European nations. But once peace groups learned of it and began to focus
on its terrible effects, this caused massive protests in Western
European nations and, eventually, an unwillingness to support the
neutron bomb deployment by their government officials. As a result, the
Carter administration finally concluded that, if Western governments
weren't willing to stand up for it, the U.S. government wasn't going to
be the villain of the piece. So Carter canceled plans for its
deployment. The MX missile was the jewel in the crown of the Reagan
administration during its first term of office. Peace groups said that
it was a first-strike weapon, and there was so much popular protest
against it that Reagan couldn't get funding through Congress.
Eventually, a plan that began as 200 missiles barely slipped through
with 50 missiles. That failure became the basis of the U.S. government's
push for strategic arms reduction treaties, for it meant the U.S.
government couldn't keep pace with development of intercontinental
ballistic missiles. And the next best thing was seeing to it that
neither country had those weapons. The best way to do that was to sign a
treaty: the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START, which Gorbachev
welcomed and showed him, in many ways, to be a peace person, strongly
influenced by the movement. Gorbachev had his own peace-oriented ideas,
but he also received a large amount of information from the disarmament
movement in the United States and around the world. He would take time
out of his meetings with heads of state to meet with representatives of
groups like the Freeze campaign, SANE, and International Physicians for
the Prevention of Nuclear War. So, Gorbachev and Reagan's detente and
the overall drawback from the nuclear brink were heavily influenced by
the peace movement --- not just through public pressure but also through
direct engagement. Are there other potentially winnable campaigns of
this kind available to anti-nuclear weapons activists today that might
limit the likelihood of the Trump administration using nuclear weapons?
It seems to me there are two ways [to **develop mass
pressure**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} **[Trump]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Congress]{.underline}** [in connection with the
general problem of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The first has to do
with the trillion dollar nuclear "modernization" program --- the plan to
upgrade the entire nuclear weapons complex, build new bombers and
missiles and submarines and so on. That cost is so great that it
provides the opportunity to reach people who are already concerned about
the arms race or are satisfied with the weapons we already have and
don't want to bankrupt the country. So [you can **make
demands**]{.underline} for cutbacks in the "modernization" plan or
stopping it entirely and mobilize a sympathetic constituency. A second
way is to focus on Trump's mental instability: The fact that he's a
reckless, dangerous leader, who really shouldn't have the button to
launch nuclear war in his hand. That's what the currently proposed
Markey-Lieu bill seeks to address: Under its provisions, unless there's
a nuclear attack on the United States, the president cannot initiate
nuclear war without a Congressional declaration of war. Since Congress
hasn't declared war since 1941, that's a pretty big restriction.

**Ravenal 9** -- Professor Emeritus at the Georgetown University School
of Foreign Service

Earl Ravenal, "Designing Defense for a New World Order," Critical
Review: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Politics and Society

[The underlying notion of "the security bureaucracies . . . looking for
new enemies" is a **threadbare concept**]{.underline} that has somehow
taken hold across the political spectrum, from the radical left (viz.
Michael Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat bank"), to the liberal
center (viz. Robert H. Johnson \[1997\], who dismisses most alleged
"threats" as "improbable dangers"), to libertarians (viz. Ted Galen
Carpenter \[1992\], Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy of the
Cato Institute, who wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies). [What
is missing from]{.underline} most analysts' [claims of "threat
inflation," however, is **a convincing theory of why**]{.underline},
say, [the]{.underline} American [government]{.underline}
significantly(not merely in excusable rhetoric) [might magnify and even
invent threats]{.underline} (and, more seriously, act on such inflated
threat estimates). In a few places, Eland (2004, 185) suggests that such
behavior might stem from military or national security bureaucrats'
attempts to enhance their personal status and organizational budgets, or
even from the influence and dominance of "the military-industrial
complex"; viz.: "Maintaining the empire and retaliating for the blowback
from that empire keeps what President Eisenhower called the
military-industrial complex fat and happy." Or, in the same section: In
the nation's capital, vested interests, such as the law enforcement
bureaucracies . . . routinely take advantage of "crises"to satisfy
parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to get pet
projects\-\-- a.k.a. pork\-\--funded by the government. And national
security crises, because of people's fears, are especially ripe
opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182) Thus,
"[bureaucratic-politics" theory]{.underline}, which once made several
reputa- tions (such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin, and
Graham Allison) in defense-intellectual circles, and spawned an entire
sub-industry within the field of international relations,5 [is put into
the service of dismissing putative security threats as
imaginary]{.underline}. So, too, can a surprisingly cognate theory,
"public choice,"6 which can be considered the right-wing analog of the
"bureaucratic-politics" model, and is a preferred interpretation of
governmental decision- making among libertarian observers. As Eland
(2004, 203) summarizes: Public-choice theory argues \[that\] the
government itself can develop sepa- rate interests from its citizens.
The government reflects the interests of powerful pressure groups and
the interests of the bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although
this problem occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more
severe in foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies
that affect them less directly. There is, in this statement of
public-choice theory, a certain ambiguity, and a certain degree of
contradiction: Bureaucrats are supposedly, at the same time, subservient
to societal interest groups and autonomous from society in general. This
journal has pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely
consequence of the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity
(e.g., Somin 1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But
state autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute
their own interests for those of what could be called the "national
society" that they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that,
precisely because of the public-ignorance and elite-expertise factors,
and especially because the opportunities\-\--at least for bureaucrats (a
few notable post-government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)\-\--for
lucrative self-dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and
diplomatic areas of government than they are in some of the
contract-dispensing and more under-the-radar-screen agencies of
government, the "public-choice" imputation of self-dealing, rather than
working toward the national interest (which, however may not be
synonymous with the interests, perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is
less likely to hold. In short, state autonomy is likely to mean, in the
derivation of foreign policy, that "state elites" are using rational
judgment, in insulation from self-promoting interest groups\-\--about
what strategies, forces, and weapons are required for national defense.
Ironically, "public choice"\-\--not even a species of economics, but
rather a kind of political interpretation\-\--is not even about "public"
choice, since, like the bureaucratic-politics model, it repudiates the
very notion that bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they
are held, axiomatically, to exhibit "rent-seeking" behavior, wherein
they abuse their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at
least to build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches.
Such sub- rational models actually explain very little of what they
purport to observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding
the "behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances,
under some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that
they posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives. My treatment of "role" differs from that of the
bureaucratic-politics theorists, whose model of the derivation of
foreign policy depends heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and
specific identification of the role- playing of organizationally
situated individuals in a partly conflictual "pulling and hauling"
process that "results in" some policy outcome. Even here,
bureaucratic-politics theorists Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow (1999,
311) allow that "some players are not able to articulate \[sic\] the
governmental politics game because their conception of their job does
not legitimate such activity." This is a crucial admission, and one that
points\-\-- empirically\-\--to the need for a broader and generic
treatment of role. Roles (all theorists state) give rise to
"expectations" of performance. My point is that [virtually every
governmental role, and especially national-security roles]{.underline},
[and particularly the roles of the uniformed mili- tary,
embody]{.underline} expectations of devotion to the "national interest";
rational- ity in the derivation of policy at every functional level; and
[**objectivity** in the treatment of parameters, especially external
parameters such as "threats" and the power and capabilities of other
nations.]{.underline} [Sub-rational models]{.underline} (such as "public
choice") [fail]{.underline} [to take into account even a partial
dedication to the "national" interest]{.underline} ([or even the
possibility that the national interest may be honestly misconceived in
more paro- chial terms). In contrast, an official's role connects the
individual to the (state-level) process, and moderates the]{.underline}
(perhaps otherwise) [self-seeking impulses of the individual.
Role-derived behavior tends to be formalized and codified; relatively
transparent and at least **peer-reviewed**, so as to be consistent with
expectations; surviving the particular individual and trans- mitted to
successors and ancillaries; measured against a standard and thus
corrigible; defined in terms of the performed function and therefore
derived from the state function; and uncorrrupt, because personal
cheating and even egregious aggrandizement are conspicuously
discouraged]{.underline}. My own direct observation suggests that
[defense decision-makers attempt to "frame" the structure of the
problems that they try to solve on the basis of the **most accurate
intelligence**. They **make it their business to know** where the
threats come from. Thus, threats **are not "socially
constructed**"]{.underline} (even though, of course, some values are). A
major reason for the rationality, and the objectivity, of the process is
that much security planning is done, not in vaguely undefined circum-
stances that offer scope for idiosyncratic, subjective behavior, but
rather in structured and reviewed organizational frameworks.
Non-rationalities (which are bad for understanding and prediction) tend
to get filtered out. [**People are fired for presenting skewed
analysis** and for making bad predictions. This is because something
important is riding on the causal analysis and the contingent
prediction.]{.underline} For these reasons, "[public choice" does not
have the "feel" of reality to many critics who have participated in the
structure of defense decision-making. In that structure]{.underline},
obvious, and even not-so-obvious,["rent-seeking" would not only be
shameful; it would present a **severe risk of career
termination**.]{.underline} And, as mentioned, the defense bureaucracy
is hardly a productive place for truly talented rent-seekers to
operatecompared to opportunities for personal profit in the commercial
world. A bureaucrat's very self-placement in these reaches of government
testi- fies either to a sincere commitment to the national interest or
to a lack of sufficient imagination to exploit opportunities for
personal profit.

The realist approach

[In the realist view]{.underline}, the **[basic
principles]{.underline}** [of international politics **never
change**]{.underline}. [International affairs]{.underline} always
[remain essentially]{.underline} [a **struggle for power**]{.underline}
[among **self-interested states**]{.underline}. [Since realism is not a
unitary theory]{.underline}, **[different branches]{.underline}** [of
realism rely on **different** independent **variables**]{.underline}.
Classical realists like Hans **[Morgenthau]{.underline}** [see perpetual
conflict rooted in an innately]{.underline} **[selfish]{.underline}**
[human]{.underline} **[nature]{.underline}**, [which translates into
competitive state behavior]{.underline} (Morgenthau 1985). [Neorealists
such as Kenneth **Waltz**]{.underline} [focus on an inherently
**competitive international system**]{.underline} [without a central
organizing authority that **monopolizes power**]{.underline} [to manage
inter-state relations and **protect states** from one
another]{.underline} (Waltz 1979). [Within this anarchic international
system, **states** are]{.underline} [the **primary actors**]{.underline}
[and employ self-help strategies to survive and]{.underline}, depending
on the exact branch of neorealism, to **[maximize power]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**. [Because of an inevitably
**asymmetric distribution**]{.underline} [of power]{.underline}, [the
anarchic condition of international affairs may]{.underline}
**[compel]{.underline}** **[weaker states]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} either **[balance]{.underline}** against
[or]{.underline} **[bandwagon]{.underline}** with more powerful ones.
[Neoclassical realists marry neorealism's systemic assumptions with
domestic level factors that either facilitate or circumscribe foreign
policy]{.underline}, for instance domestic institutions,
government-society relations, and leadership perception (Ripsman et
al. 2016).

[Realism is]{.underline} generally **[pessimistic]{.underline}** [about
the prospects for **coop**eration]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[mutual support]{.underline}** [among states.]{.underline} [It
would]{.underline} immediately **[predict]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} national **[self-help and "us first"]{.underline}**
**[mentality]{.underline}** [that characterizes the global management of
**Covid-19** and its consequences]{.underline}. Travel and entry bans,
international scapegoating, great power competition and pharmaceutical
protectionism are ubiquitous.

[Even in the world's most integrated supranational organization, the
European Union (EU), member states **readily violate** otherwise
sacrosanct principles of cooperation]{.underline}, [and realists would
not be surprised by how quickly lofty European ideals and norms made way
for national self-help once the Covid-19 crisis hit the
continent]{.underline}. The outbreak was followed by immediate violation
of many existing EU regulations: competition law, fiscal discipline, and
freedom of movement[. As countries closed their borders, EU capitals
went into full nationalist gear]{.underline} (Guardian 2020a). Without
any EU-consultation process, a number of EU countries immediately closed
their borders and decreed export bans. When Italy, one of the worst
affected countries in the world, asked fellow EU members for emergency
relief with critical medical supplies, for several weeks it was met with
precisely what realism would expect: its neighbors violated the EU's
single-market spirit by decreeing export bans on pharmaceutical
equipment (Braw 2020; Reuters 2020).

[Dismayed by the lack of European solidarity, Rome was happy to accept
support from China, which, though itself badly affected, sent medical
equipment and experts immediately. Far from being altruistic, however,
Beijing aims to rewrite the Covid-19 narrative]{.underline}. It does not
want to be seen as the point-of-origin of the Covid-19 virus and views
the pandemic as an opportunity to come out ahead of the United States in
a zero-sum competition for global primacy. In Italy and elsewhere,
China's "mask diplomacy" is a noteworthy public relations coup (Kliem
and Chong 2020). Beijing wants to be recognized globally as a
responsible provider of public health goods in the absence of US
leadership, and thereby, progress towards its ultimate objective of
comprehensive power accumulation relative to Washington.

Indeed, the US has not only been absent in terms of leadership, but has
also actively engaged in nationalistic self-help at the expense of
others. President Donald Trump of the United States, Europe's closest
non-EU ally and partner, tried to lure CureVac, a German firm that was
developing a promising Covid-19 vaccine technology, to relocate its
Covid-19 research and development division to the US and to guarantee
exclusive American access to the firm's products (Die Welt 2020).
Similarly, Trump sought to block the sale of masks to Canada by a
US-based firm (MacCharles and Ballingall 2020), though a compromise was
arrived at later. The US (like other countries, e.g. Japan) has also
sought to restructure global supply chains in order to bypass dependence
on China (Pamuk and Shalal 2020), which---if it succeeds---will be a
radical and long-term change.

[Realists]{.underline} also [point out that **international
institutions**]{.underline} [do not **enable states** to **concentrate**
on greater **long-term gains** for everyone]{.underline}. Instead,
[international]{.underline} **[anarchy]{.underline}** [forces states to
**treat** international]{.underline} **[organizations]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[institutions]{.underline}** essentially **[like the
international system]{.underline}** itself: [as an arena for zero-sum
**competition**]{.underline}. [Indeed, as realism predicts, the World
Health Organization (WHO) has become **highly
politicized**.]{.underline} [For example, because of the PRC's refusal
to accept Taiwan as a diplomatically independent, sovereign nation
state, the WHO disregards Taiwan's experience with Covid-19 as well as
related research and development results. Allegedly bowing to pressure
from Beijing, the WHO does not recognize Taiwan and refuses to include
Taipei's very successful pandemic management strategies in its reports
on global research efforts]{.underline} (Financial Times 2020). This
also supports the neoclassical realists' argument about domestic
factors. It shows how domestic ideology shapes foreign policy decisions
in China and hinders international cooperation.

[If a severe **transboundary**]{.underline} [global]{.underline}
**[crisis]{.underline}** [cannot spur international cooperation, then
**what can**]{.underline}? [Realism reminds us that, because of the
**trust deficit**]{.underline} systemically **[inherent]{.underline}**
[in an international system characterized by **anarchy**]{.underline},
[states **hesitate**]{.underline} [to forgo their **first
instinct**]{.underline} [for self-help and zero-sum games]{.underline},
**[even amidst]{.underline}** a [common]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}** **[challenge]{.underline}**.

The liberal approach

Liberal theory highlights four imperatives for cooperation:
interdependence, transnationalization, the growth of international
institutions, and democracy (Doyle and Recchia 2011; Nye 1988).

When the fates of states are bound together, liberals claim, they must
cooperate or pay a very high price. The global economy, for instance, is
a complex network of trade, finance and manufacturing that places a
premium on cooperation. From this perspective, states must cooperate to
stem pandemics that flow seamlessly across the world and impose high
costs on all societies. They must share knowledge and material resources
to counter a scourge that harms them all. They certainly do so, for
example, in US-led efforts to ensure the reliable availability of
equipment to combat pandemics (Tribune 2020). But they do not cooperate
consistently. The [United States has sought to corner scarce medical
supplies (Bradley 2020), European states have failed to coordinate
policy (The Guardian 2020a), and China and the United States are
squabbling over responsibility (Shi and Wu 2020). In short, the pattern
is much as in another arena of contest between interdependent states:
the as yet unfinished "trade war."]{.underline}

Why? Interdependence does not automatically produce cooperation. It is
only when the breakdown of interdependence raises the prospect of
serious catastrophe that states cooperate. When nuclear-armed states are
on the verge of war, for instance, they engage in tacit cooperation by
practicing extreme caution and often seek explicit accommodation through
talks, as was the case in Cold War crises. Even so, they continue to
compete through arms racing, alliance building and occasional
brinkmanship. Comparatively low levels of interdependence amidst the
Covid-19 outbreak are unlikely to generate high levels of cooperation as
the threat to national survival is limited.

[The onset of pandemics has certainly produced unprecedented cooperation
among epistemic communities, such as virologists, in a
transnationalized]{.underline} world. Scientists from many countries
have worked together to manage the threat of a viral outbreak ever since
the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002. [The
appearance of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012
quickly led to the activation of a scientific network that has been
dubbed the "SARS club"]{.underline} (Butler 2012). More broadly, the
onset of MERS spurred global research, producing as many as 883
scientific papers in 92 countries between 2012 and 2015 (Zyoud 2016).
[Likewise, as the New York Times has noted, the Covid-19 outbreak has
galvanized unparalleled cooperative research in which scientists have
bypassed standard protocols and competitive secrecy to engage in shared
efforts (Apuzzo and Kirkpatrick 2020).]{.underline} But, not for the
first time, politics has trumped cooperation. The possibility of a
quantum leap in global scientific collaboration has been stymied by the
China-US spat, which has reduced the prospects of shared funding and
finance to fight the virus. [The US, for instance, stopped funding of a
critical coronavirus-related training program for Chinese and other
scientists even before the current outbreak. National priorities have
overridden collective action, which is entirely in accord with realist
expectations (Baumgaertner and Rainey 2020).]{.underline}

[The same malaise afflicts international institutions, which liberals
see as fostering high levels of cooperation. The Group of 7 major
economies (G7) failed to organize a summit meeting in March 2020, while
a subsequent meeting of their foreign ministers came up with no more
than an anodyne statement seeking to foster research cooperation and do
"whatever is necessary" to counter the economic fallout of the crisis
even as they disagreed on whether China was to blame for the onset of
the crisis]{.underline} (Schult 2020). The G20 did not do much better.
It did support debt relief for poor countries, but its announced \$5
trillion injection into the global economy was in fact no more than the
sum of moneys already committed by its individual members for themselves
(Chodor 2020). The institution at the center of the crisis, the WHO, has
been acknowledged as critical to the information flow relating to the
crisis. But the WHO has also been dogged by controversy for announcing
the onset of the pandemic late (on 11 March, by which time it had
already spread to 113 countries) and for apparently deferring to China
in doing so (Basrur 2020). Such failings have brought much criticism and
calls for its reform (South China Morning Post 2020).

Finally, [democracy is said to be a binding factor, at least among
developed economies. This is largely true with respect to the
relationship between democracy and war]{.underline}. But the evidence is
not persuasive in the present context. Developed democratic states in
Europe and North America have engaged in recurring tugs of war over the
sharing of counter-pandemic resources such as protective equipment and
ventilators and have done relatively little to take collective action
(Cohen and Musmar 2020). Overall, liberal theory does not have much to
offer to explain the weak nature of international cooperation in the
crisis.

Ideational approaches

[The constructivist approach is an essentially ideational theory (or set
of theories) that stresses the importance of belief structures,
identities and roles, holding that, fundamentally, the ways in which
actors behave in international politics are shaped by a consensus about
reality and appropriate responses to it]{.underline} (Onuf 1989). From
this standpoint, responses to the Covid-19 crisis are determined by
deeply embedded beliefs about the priorities that states should adhere
to in such a situation. The possibilities of cooperation, from a
constructivist perspective, are not circumscribed by the anarchic
condition in which states coexist (as realists would have it), but by
our beliefs about what is feasible and what is not in such a condition
(Pouliot 2011). The central dictum of the constructivist---"anarchy is
what states make of it" (Wendt 1992)---thus sees the lack of collective
action in the face of the pandemic not as an inevitable product of the
material reality of the world as it actually is, but as arising from a
realist thought structure. To wit, states fail to cooperate despite the
urgency of the Covid-19 crisis because they are weighed down by the
unquestioned notion that, even under the onslaught of a pandemic,
self-help must come first, and the exercise of power must shape action.
This worldview, for the constructivist, is an ideational construct that
needs to be overridden if cooperation is to be achieved.

It is to the credit of constructivism that it widens the space for
potential change by critiquing the realist perception of unalterable
reality. However, while the concept of ideational structure is helpful
in challenging established modes of thinking (and consequent habits of
action) over time, it [is not particularly helpful in offering insights
into the short-to-medium-term responses of states to crises like the
pandemic or to anticipating what, in fashioning states' responses, might
actually be do-able and what probably will not.]{.underline} On the
contrary, since constructivist thinking views both cooperation and
conflict in terms of thought structures, it explains very little as far
as responses to the current crisis go. In short, constructivism is not a
predictive theory and tends to be non-falsifiable and, more
pragmatically, lacking in much utility other than urging new thinking.
How to get from the present ideational structure to a more desirable one
when a crisis breaks out remains a knotty problem.

[Normative theory, which centers on moral judgment about what should
be---as distinct from the materialist view of international politics as
what is---is similarly problematic]{.underline} (Ramel 2011). Certainly,
it offers useful space for the identification of responsibility when a
crisis breaks out. The analyst may adopt two basic approaches that
Robert Gregory labels "backward-mapping" and "forward-mapping" (Gregory
1998). The former looks at the origin and history of the policy process
and how they might have created or contributed to the problem. In the
present case, one would ask: who was responsible for the outbreak of the
pandemic? A second question would be: was policymaker X warned about the
problem and did he/she take action to avert it or mitigate its potential
consequences? The latter approach considers the policy action taken at
the time of the crisis. Did the policymaker act appropriately once the
crisis had broken out? While both are normative questions, they also
have strong practical implications. The attribution of responsibility
relates to the consequences of the policymaker's actions and to whether
the individual held responsible was fittingly sanctioned or punished for
it, whether legally or politically. This has important implications. If
the person or persons responsible is/are not in some way punished,
he/she/they may tend to repeat this or similar errors and cause a
recurrence of societal harm. Here, China would certainly be one center
of analysis, as questions mount as to whether Beijing took the necessary
steps to share information once the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus
was first confirmed by Chinese medical doctors in late December (The
Guardian 2020b). As mentioned above, the WHO too is open to the charge
of prioritizing political expediency by not including Taiwan in its
assessments and recommendations.

The [problem, however, of explaining why states behave as they do
remains]{.underline}. The attribution of responsibility for a crisis is
normally only a post facto phenomenon and does little to inform the
analyst as to why international cooperation as a pattern of behavior
does or does not occur. Even more, the scope for anticipating future
behavior remains uncertain at best. Like constructivism, normative
theory is valuable in understanding critical aspects of international
cooperation or the lack of it, but it misses some of the most important
facets of international reality: it fails to explain why states tend to
let competition override cooperation when individual and collective
interests collide.

Conclusion: realism redux

Much post-Cold War academic thinking gave the appearance of a
"transition" in the way intellectuals view global politics: a "decline"
of realism and the rise of alternative approaches in apex-level
scholarly research (Maliniak et al 2011). However, this analysis shows
that [alternative paradigms in IRT have **much less grasp**]{.underline}
[over the current crisis than **realism**]{.underline}. The [continued
**dominance of the state**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} of
**[individual]{.underline}** [national]{.underline}
**[interests]{.underline}** [over **collective interests**]{.underline}
in the absence of effective international authority [is
**evident**]{.underline} [in global responses to the
pandemic]{.underline}. [Realism]{.underline} [tells us
that]{.underline}, [because of the systemic **trust
deficit**]{.underline} [in international affairs]{.underline},
especially in times of crises, [states will turn to
**self-help**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[zero-sum
calculations]{.underline}** [rather than]{.underline} to [cooperative
**collective action**]{.underline}. It is evident that [precisely such
behavior **dominates** the global **management**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} the **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 crisis. To be sure,
[cooperation]{.underline} does [occur]{.underline}, but
**[only]{.underline}** [when it **does not clash** with **national
interest**]{.underline}.

Going forward, a realist would expect further restrictions on
international exchange in order to minimize the threat and at least a
temporary but nonetheless significant scale-down of globalization, as it
were. The economic effects of the crisis are likely to be severe and
unpredictable, and likely to include recession, flight of capital,
widespread impoverishment, fall in agricultural output, and increased
deaths from other diseases such as malaria and HIV (Congressional
Research Service 2020; Economist 2020; Shiller 2020). These will be
subject to the same dynamics of cooperation and conflict as described
here, in particular in the context of Sino-US competition.

Rather worryingly, the Covid-19 crisis also points to what global action
on other critical issues such as climate change, severe economic
dislocation, or the apocalyptic consequences of nuclear war could look
like in the future. They will in all probability not induce intense
global cooperation to manage common challenges, but instead spur
nationalism, zero-sum competition and the application of power to secure
the objectives of individual nations.

On the positive side, realism also tells us that states try to imitate
the successful activities of their peers. Governments may look jealously
upon one another, but they will also adopt those measures used by others
that are seen to be working. In that sense, we can place hope in the
ability of Europeans and Americans to emulate successful measures taken
by states like New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan to contain the spread
of Covid-19.

Clearly, while all branches of IRT have something to offer, [realism is
**best equipped**]{.underline} [to explain and
**anticipate**]{.underline} [the ambit of international
**coop**eration]{.underline} [in a crisis of the **magnitude
of**]{.underline} the **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 pandemic. [Discounting
its value can only **subtract**]{.underline} [from the **potential of
IR**]{.underline} [as a discipline to **meet** its **social
function**]{.underline}.

**Realism is accurate AND the only methodology to analyze threats.**

Some [moral enhancement theorists argue]{.underline} that [a society of
**morally enhanced individuals**]{.underline} [would be in a better
position to cope with important problems that humankind is likely to
face in]{.underline} the future such as, for instance, the threats posed
by **[climate change]{.underline}**, grand scale **[terrorist
attacks]{.underline}**, or the risk of **[catastrophic
wars.]{.underline}** [The assumption here is]{.underline} quite simple:
[our inability to cope successfully with these problems stems mainly
from a sort of deficit in human beings' **moral
motivation**]{.underline}. [If human beings were morally
better]{.underline} -- if we had enhanced moral dispositions -- [there
would be **fewer wars, less terrorism**, and more **willingness to save
our environment**.]{.underline} Although simple and attractive, **[this
assumption is]{.underline}**, as I intend to show,
**[false]{.underline}**. [At the root of threats to the survival of
humankind in the future is not a deficit in our moral
dispositions]{.underline}, [but the endurance of an **old political
arrangement** that prevents the pursuit of shared goals on a collective
basis.]{.underline} The political arrangement I have in mind here is the
international system of states. In my analysis of the political
implications of moral enhancement, I intend to concentrate my attention
only on the supposition that we could avoid major wars in the future by
making individuals morally better. I do not intend to discuss the
threats posed by climate change, or by terrorism, although some human
enhancement theorists also seek to cover these topics. I will explain,
in the course of my analysis, a conceptual distinction between "human
nature realism" and "structural realism," well-known in the field of
international relations theory. Thomas Douglas seems to have been among
the first to explore the idea of "moral enhancement" as a new form of
human enhancement. He certainly helped to kick off the current phase of
the debate. In a paper published in 2008, Douglas suggests that in the
"future people might use biomedical technology to morally enhance
themselves." Douglas characterizes moral enhancement in terms of the
acquisition of "morally better motives" (Douglas 2008, 229). Mark
Walker, in a paper published in 2009, suggests a similar idea. He
characterizes moral enhancement in terms of improved moral dispositions
or "genetic virtues": The Genetic Virtue Program (GVP) is a proposal for
influencing our moral nature through biology, that is, it is an
alternate yet complementary means by which ethics and ethicists might
contribute to the task of making our lives and world a better place. The
basic idea is simple enough: genes influence human behavior, so altering
the genes of individuals may alter the influence genes exert on
behavior. (Walker 2009, 27--28) Walker does not argue in favor of any
specific moral theory, such as, for instance, virtue ethics. Whether one
endorses a deontological or a utilitarian approach to ethics, he argues,
the concept of virtue is relevant to the extent that virtues motivate us
either to do the right thing or to maximize the good (Walker 2009, 35).
Moral enhancement theory, however, does not reduce the ethical debate to
the problem of moral dispositions. Morality also concerns, to a large
extent, questions about reasons for action. And moral enhancement, most
certainly, will not improve our moral beliefs; neither could it be used
to settle moral disagreements. This seems to have led some authors to
criticize the moral enhancement idea on the ground that it neglects the
cognitive side of our moral behavior. Robert Sparrow, for instance,
argues that, from a Kantian point of view, moral enhancement would have
to provide us with better moral beliefs rather than enhanced moral
motivation (Sparrow 2014, 25; see also Agar 2010, 74). Yet, it seems to
me that this objection misses the point of the moral enhancement idea.
[Many people, across different countries, already share moral beliefs
relating]{.underline}, for instance, [to the wrongness of harming or
killing other people arbitrarily,]{.underline} or to the moral
requirement to help people in need. They may share moral beliefs while
not sharing the same reasons for these beliefs, or perhaps even not
being able to articulate the beliefs in the conceptual framework of a
moral theory (Blackford 2010, 83). But although they share some moral
beliefs, in some circumstances they may lack the appropriate motivation
to act accordingly. Moral enhancement, thus, aims at improving moral
motivation, and leaves open the question as to how to improve our moral
judgments. In a recent paper, published in The Journal of Medical
Ethics, neuroscientist Molly Crockett reports the state of the art in
the still very embryonic field of moral enhancement. She points out, for
example, that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
citalopram seems to increase harm aversion. There is, moreover, some
evidence that this substance may be effective in the treatment of
specific types of aggressive behavior. Like Douglas, Crockett emphasizes
that moral enhancement should aim at individuals' moral motives
(Crockett 2014; see also Spence 2008; Terbeck et al. 2013). Another
substance that is frequently mentioned in the moral enhancement
literature is oxytocin. Some [studies suggest that willingness to
cooperate with other people]{.underline},and to trust unknown
prospective cooperators, [may be enhanced by an increase in the levels
of oxytoci]{.underline}n in the organism (Zak 2008, 2011; Zak and Kugler
2011; Persson and Savulescu 2012, 118--119). Oxytocin has also been
reported to be "associated with the subjective experience of empathy"
(Zak 2011, 55; Zak and Kugler 2011, 144). The question I would like to
examine now concerns the supposition that moral enhancement --
comprehended in these terms and assuming for the sake of argument that,
some day, it might become effective and safe -- may also help us in
coping with the threat of devastating wars in the future. [The
assumption that there is a relationship between,]{.underline} on the one
hand, [threats to the survival of humankind and]{.underline}, on the
other, [a sort of "deficit" in our moral dispositions is
c]{.underline}learly [made by]{.underline} some [moral enhancements
theorists]{.underline}. Douglas, for instance, argues that "according to
many plausible theories, some of the world's most important problems ---
such as developing world poverty, climate change and war --- can be
attributed to these moral deficits" (2008, 230). Walker, in a similar
vein, writes about the possibility of "using biotechnology to alter our
biological natures in an effort to reduce evil in the world" (2009, 29).
And Julian Savulescu and Ingmar Persson go as far as to defend the "the
need for moral enhancement" of humankind in a series of articles, and in
a book published in 2012. One of the reasons Savulescu and Persson
advance for the moral enhancement of humankind is that our moral
dispositions seem to have remained basically unchanged over the last
millennia (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 2). These dispositions have
proved thus far quite useful for the survival of human beings as a
species. They have enabled us to cooperate with each other in the
collective production of things such as food, shelter, tools, and
farming. They have also played a crucial role in the creation and
refinement of a variety of human institutions such as settlements,
villages, and laws. Although the possibility of free-riding has never
been fully eradicated, the benefits provided by cooperation have largely
exceeded the disadvantages of our having to deal with occasional
uncooperative or untrustworthy individuals (Persson and Savulescu 2012,
39). The problem, however, is that the same dispositions that have
enabled human beings in the past to engage in the collective production
of so many artifacts and institutions now seem powerless in the face of
the human capacity to destroy other human beings on a grand scale, or
perhaps even to annihilate the entire human species. There is, according
to Savulescu and Persson, a "mismatch" between our cognitive faculties
and our evolved moral attitudes: "\[...\] as we have repeatedly
stressed, owing to the progress of science, the range of our powers of
action has widely outgrown the range of our spontaneous moral attitudes,
and created a dangerous mismatch" (Persson and Savulescu 2012, 103; see
also Persson and Savulescu 2010, 660; Persson and Savulescu 2011b;
DeGrazie 2012, 2; Rakić 2014, 2). This worry about the mismatch between,
on the one hand, the modern technological capacity to destroy and, on
the other, our limited moral commitments is not new. The political
philosopher Hans Morgenthau, best known for his defense of political
realism, called attention to the same problem nearly fifty years ago. In
the wake of the first successful tests with thermonuclear bombs,
conducted by the USA and the former Soviet Union, Morgenthau referred to
the "contrast" between the technological progress of our age and our
feeble moral attitudes as one of the most disturbing dilemmas of our
time: The first dilemma consists in the contrast between the
technological unification of the world and the parochial moral
commitments and political institutions of the age. Moral commitments and
political institutions, dating from an age which modern technology has
left behind, have not kept pace with technological achievements and,
hence, are incapable of controlling their destructive potentialities.
(Morgenthau 1962, 174) Moral enhancement theorists and political
realists like Morgenthau, therefore, share the thesis that our natural
moral dispositions are not strong enough to prevent human beings from
endangering their own existence as a species. But they differ as to the
best way out of this quandary: moral enhancement theorists argue for the
re-engineering of our moral dispositions, whereas Morgenthau accepted
the immutability of human nature and argued, instead, for the
re-engineering of world politics. Both positions, as I intend to show,
are wrong in assuming that the "dilemma" results from the weakness of
our spontaneous moral dispositions in the face of the unprecedented
technological achievements of our time. On the other hand, [both
positions are correct in recognizing the **real possibility** of global
catastrophes resulting from the malevolent use of, for instance,
**biotechnology or nuclear capabilities.**]{.underline} The supposition
that individuals' unwillingness to cooperate with each other, even when
they would be better-off by choosing to cooperate, results from a sort
of deficit of dispositions such as altruism, empathy, and benevolence
has been at the core of some important political theories. This idea is
an important assumption in the works of early modern political realists
such as Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes. It was also later endorsed by
some well-known authors writing about the origins of war in the first
half of the twentieth century. It was then believed, as Sigmund Freud
suggested in a text from 1932, that the main cause of wars is a human
tendency to "hatred and destruction" (in German: ein Trieb zum Hassen
und Vernichtung). [Freud went as far as to suggest that human beings
have an ingrained "inclination" to "aggression" and
"destruction"]{.underline} (Aggressionstrieb, Aggressionsneigung, and
Destruktionstrieb), and that this inclination has a "good biological
basis" (biologisch wohl begründet) (Freud 1999, 20--24; see also Freud
1950; Forbes 1984; Pick 1993, 211--227; Medoff 2009). The [attempt to
employ Freud's conception of human nature in understanding international
relations has recently been resumed]{.underline}, for instance by Kurt
Jacobsen in a paper entitled "Why Freud Matters: Psychoanalysis and
International Relations Revisited," published in 2013. Morgenthau
himself was deeply influenced by Freud's speculations on the origins of
war.1 Early in the 1930s, Morgenthau wrote an essay called "On the
Origin of the Political from the Nature of Human Beings" (Über die
Herkunft des Politischen aus dem Wesen des Menschen), which contains
several references to Freud's theory about the human propensity to
aggression.2 Morgenthau's most influential book, Politics among Nations:
The Struggle for Power and Peace, first published in 1948 and then
successively revised and edited, is still considered a landmark work in
the tradition of political realism. According to Morgenthau, politics is
governed by laws that have their origin in human nature: "Political
realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by
objective laws that have their roots in human nature" (Morgenthau 2006,
4). Just like human enhancement theorists, Morgenthau also takes for
granted that human nature has not changed over recent millennia: "Human
nature, in which the laws of politics have their roots, has not changed
since the classical philosophies of China, India, and Greece endeavored
to discover these laws" (Morgenthau 2006, 4). And since, for Morgenthau,
human nature prompts human beings to act selfishly, rather than
cooperatively, political leaders will sometimes favor conflict over
cooperation, unless some superior power compels them to act otherwise.
Now, this is exactly what happens in the domain of international
relations. For in the international sphere there is not a supranational
institution with the real power to prevent states from pursuing means of
self-defense. The acquisition of means of self-defense, however, is
frequently perceived by other states as a threat to their own security.
This leads to the security dilemma and the possibility of war. As
Morgenthau put the problem in an article published in 1967: "The actions
of states are determined not by moral principles and legal commitments
but by considerations of interest and power" (1967, 3). Because
Morgenthau and early modern political philosophers such as Machiavelli
and Hobbes defended political realism on the grounds provided by a
specific conception human nature, their version of political realism has
been frequently called "human nature realism." The literature on human
nature realism has become quite extensive (Speer 1968; Booth 1991;
Freyberg-Inan 2003; Kaufman 2006; Molloy 2006, 82--85; Craig 2007;
Scheuerman 2007, 2010, 2012; Schuett 2007; Neascu 2009; Behr 2010,
210--225; Brown 2011; Jütersonke 2012). It is not my intention here to
present a fully-fledged account of the tradition of human nature
realism, but rather to emphasize the extent to which some moral
enhancement theorists, in their description of some of the gloomy
scenarios humankind is likely to face in the future, implicitly endorse
this kind of political realism. Indeed, like human nature realists,
moral enhancement theorists assume that human nature has not changed
over the last millennia, and that violence and lack of cooperation in
the international sphere result chiefly from human nature's limited
inclination to pursue morally desirable goals. One may, of course,
criticize the human enhancement project by rejecting the assumption that
conflict and violence in the international domain should be explained by
means of a theory about human nature. In a reply to Savulescu and
Persson, [Sparrow correctly argues that **"structural issues,"** rather
than **human nature**, constitute the main factor underlying political
conflicts]{.underline} (Sparrow 2014, 29). But he does not explain what
exactly these "structural issues" are, as I intend to do later. Sparrow
is right in rejecting the human nature theory underlying the human
enhancement project. But this underlying assumption, in my view, is not
trivially false or simply "ludicrous," as he suggests. Human nature
realism has been implicitly or explicitly endorsed by leading political
philosophers ever since Thucydides speculated on the origins of war in
antiquity (Freyberg-Inan 2003, 23--36). True, it might be objected that
"human nature realism," as it was defended by Morgenthau and earlier
political philosophers, relied upon a metaphysical or psychoanalytical
conception of human nature, a conception that, actually, did not have
the support of any serious scientific investigation (Smith 1983, 167).
Yet, over the last few years there has been much empirical research in
fields such as developmental psychology and evolutionary biology that
apparently gives some support to the realist claim. Some of these
studies suggest that an inclination to aggression and conflict has its
origins in our evolutionary history. This idea, then, has recently led
some authors to resume "human nature realism" on new foundations, devoid
of the metaphysical assumptions of the early realists, and entirely
grounded in empirical research. Indeed, some recent works in the field
of international relations theory already seek to call attention to
evolutionary biology as a possible new start for political realism. This
point is clearly made, for instance, by Bradley Thayer, who published in
2004 a book called Darwin and International Relations: On the
Evolutionary Origins of War and Ethnic Conflict. And in a paper
published in 2000, he affirms the following: Evolutionary theory
provides a stronger foundation for realism because it is based on
science, not on theology or metaphysics. I use the theory to explain two
human traits: egoism and domination. I submit that the egoistic and
dominating behavior of individuals, which is commonly described as
"realist," is a product of the evolutionary process. I focus on these
two traits because they are critical components of any realist argument
in explaining international politics. (Thayer 2000, 125; see also Thayer
2004) Thayer basically argues that a tendency to egoism and domination
stems from human evolutionary history. The predominance of conflict and
competition in the domain of international politics, he argues, is a
reflex of dispositions that can now be proved to be part of our evolved
human nature in a way that Morgenthau and other earlier political
philosophers could not have established in their own time. Now, what
some moral enhancement theorists propose is a direct intervention in our
"evolved limited moral psychology" as a means to make us "fit" to cope
with some possible devastating consequences from the predominance of
conflict and competition in the domain of international politics
(Persson and Savulescu 2010, 664). Moral enhancement theorists
comprehend the nature of war and conflicts, especially those conflicts
that humankind is likely to face in the future, as the result of human
beings' limited moral motivations. Compared to supporters of human
nature realism, however, moral enhancement theorists are less skeptical
about the prospect of our taming human beings' proclivity to do evil.
For our knowledge in fields such as neurology and pharmacology does
already enable us to enhance people's performance in a variety of
activities, and there seems to be no reason to assume it will not enable
us to enhance people morally in the future. But [the
question]{.underline}, of course, is [whether moral enhancement
will]{.underline} also [improve the prospect of our coping
successfully]{.underline} [with]{.underline} some major threats to the
**[survival of humankind]{.underline}**, as Savulescu and Persson
propose, or **[to reduce evil in the world]{.underline}**, as proposed
by Walker. V. The point to which I would next like to call attention is
that "human nature realism" -- which is implicitly presupposed by some
moral enhancement theorists -- has been much criticized over the last
decades within the tradition of political realism itself. "Structural
realism," unlike "human nature realism," does not seek to derive a
theory about conflicts and violence in the context of international
relations from a theory of the moral shortcomings of human nature.
Structural realism was originally proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the
State and War, published in 1959, and then later in another book called
Theory of International Politics, published in 1979. In both works,
Waltz seeks to avoid committing himself to any specific conception of
human nature (Waltz 2001, x--xi). Waltz's thesis is that the thrust of
the political realism doctrine can be retained without our having to
commit ourselves to any theory about the shortcomings of human nature.
What is relevant for our understanding of international politics is,
instead, our understanding of the "structure" of the international
system of states (Waltz 1986). John Mearsheimer, too, is an important
contemporary advocate of political realism. Although he seeks to
distance himself from some ideas defended by Waltz, he also rejects
human nature realism and, like Waltz, refers to himself as a supporter
of "structural realism" (Mearsheimer 2001, 20). One of the basic tenets
of political realism (whether "human nature realism" or "structural
realism") is, first, that the [states are the]{.underline} main, if not
the **[only, relevant actors]{.underline}** in the context of
international relations; [and]{.underline} second, that states
**[compete for power]{.underline}** in the international arena. **[Moral
considerations]{.underline}** in international affairs, according to
realists, [are **secondary**]{.underline} [when set against the state's
primary goal]{.underline}, **[namely its own security and
survival]{.underline}**. But while human nature realists such as
Morgenthau explain the struggle for power as a result of human beings'
natural inclinations, structural realists like Waltz and Mearsheimer
argue that conflicts in the international arena do not stem from human
nature, but from the very "structure" of the international system of
states (Mearsheimer 2001, 18). According to Waltz and Mearsheimer, [it
is this **structure** that compels individuals to act as they do in the
domain of international affairs.]{.underline} And one distinguishing
feature of the international system of states is [its "anarchical
structure,"]{.underline} i.e. the lack of a central government analogous
to the central governments that exist in the context of domestic
politics. [It means that each individual state is responsible for its
own integrity and survival]{.underline}. [In the absence of a superior
authority]{.underline}, over and above the power of each sovereign
state, [political leaders]{.underline} often [feel compelled to favor
**security over morality**]{.underline}, even if, all other things being
considered, they would naturally be more inclined to trust and to
cooperate with political leaders of other states. On the other hand,
when political leaders do trust and cooperate with other states, it is
not necessarily their benevolent nature that motivates them to be
cooperative and trustworthy, but, again, it is the structure of the
system of states that compels them. The concept of human nature, as we
can see, does not play a decisive role here. Because Waltz and
Mearsheimer depart from "human nature realism," their version of
political realism has also sometimes been called "neo-realism" (Booth
1991, 533). Thus, **[even if]{.underline}** [human beings turn out to
become **morally enhanced**]{.underline} in the future, [humankind may
still have to face the same **scary scenarios**]{.underline} described
by some moral enhancement theorists. [This is likely to happen if,
indeed]{.underline}, [human beings remain compelled to
cooperate]{.underline} within the present structure of the system of
states. Consider, for instance, the incident with a Norwegian weather
rocket in January 1995. Russian radars detected a missile that was
initially suspected of being on its way to reach Moscow in five minutes.
All levels of Russian military defense were immediately put on alert for
a possible imminent attack and massive retaliation. It is reported that
for the first time in history a Russian president had before him, ready
to be used, the "nuclear briefcase" from which the permission to launch
nuclear weapons is issued. And that happened when the Cold War was
already supposed to be over! In the event, it was realized that the
rocket was leaving Russian territory and Boris Yeltsin did not have to
enter the history books as the man who started the third world war by
mistake (Cirincione 2008, 382).3 But [under the crushing pressure of
having to decide in such a short time, and on the basis of unreliable
information, whether or not to retaliate, even a morally enhanced
Yeltsin might have given orders to launch a devastating nuclear
response]{.underline} -- and that **[in spite of strong moral
dispositions to the contrary.]{.underline}** Writing for The Guardian on
the basis of recently declassified documents, Rupert Myers reports
further incidents similar to the one of 1995. He suggests that as more
states strive to acquire nuclear capability, the danger of a major
nuclear accident is likely to increase (Myers 2014). [What has to be
changed]{.underline}, therefore, [is not human moral
dispositions]{.underline}, **[but the very structure of the political
international system of states]{.underline}** within which we currently
live. As far as major threats to the survival of humankind are
concerned, moral enhancement might play an important role in the future
only to the extent that it will help humankind to change the structure
of the system of states. While [moral enhancement]{.underline} may
possibly have desirable results in some areas of human cooperation that
do not badly threaten our security -- such as donating food, medicine,
and money to poorer countries -- it [will not motivate political leaders
to **dismantle their nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. [Neither will it
deter other political leaders from pursuing nuclear
capability]{.underline}, [at any rate not as long as the structure of
international politics compels them to see prospective cooperators **in
the present as possible enemies in the future.**]{.underline} The idea
of a "structure" should not be understood here in metaphysical terms, as
though it mysteriously existed in a transcendent world and had the
magical power of determining leaders' decisions in this world. The word
"structure" denotes merely a political arrangement in which there are no
powerful law-enforcing institutions. And [in the absence of the kind of
security that law-enforcing institutions have the force to
create]{.underline}, [political leaders will]{.underline} often **[fail
to cooperate,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} occasionally [engage
in]{.underline} conflicts and [wars]{.underline}, [in those areas that
are critical to their]{.underline} security and [survival]{.underline}.
Given the structure of international politics and the basic goal of
survival, [this is likely to continue to happen]{.underline}, **[even
if,]{.underline}** in the future, political [leaders become **less
egoistic and power-seeking**]{.underline} through moral enhancement. On
the other hand, since the structure of the international system of
states is itself another human institution, there is no reason to
suppose that it cannot ever be changed. If people become morally
enhanced in the future they may possibly feel more strongly motivated to
change the structure of the system of states, or perhaps even feel
inclined to abolish it altogether. In my view, however, [addressing
major threats to the survival of humankind in the future by means of
**bioengineering**]{.underline} [is unlikely to yield the **expected
results**, so long as moral enhancement is pursued **within the present
framework of the international system of states.**]{.underline}

[An Agenda For Ensuring **Security**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[Stability]{.underline}** in the Age of AI

[The starting point for dealing]{.underline} with the [international
**security implications**]{.underline} [of AI must be the
**acknowledgment**]{.underline} [that we are in it for the **long
haul**]{.underline}. There will be no quick fixes. [The]{.underline}
**[economic]{.underline}**, **[political]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[security drivers]{.underline}** [for mainstreaming
this]{.underline} **[suite of technologies]{.underline}**
[into]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}** functions
[are]{.underline} simply **[too powerful to be rolled
back]{.underline}**. [There will be plenty of **persuasive** national
**security applications**]{.underline}---[minimizing
casualties]{.underline} and [collateral damage]{.underline} through
[better discrimination of targets]{.underline}, [fighting]{.underline}
crime, defeating terrorist threats, saving on defense spending, and
protecting soldiers and their bases---to provide counterarguments
against concerns about runaway robots or accidental war caused by
machine error.

This acknowledgment must be accompanied by an intensification of
crossdomain literacy. AI cannot be the business of coders and cognitive
scientists alone; nor can its security implications be the province only
of diplomats, generals, and lawyers. Given the broad impact that AI
businesses can have on society, the business of AI has to be everyone's
business. Governance of AI can only be based on a correct understanding
of the power and limits of the technology, and such governance can only
be effective globally if it is part of a tiered approach that includes
actors at the intergovernmental, national, and industry levels.

Currently, [though]{.underline} military [investments in
**AI**]{.underline} [are]{.underline} being [acknowledged]{.underline},
[no state admits to the **existence**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
lethal autonomous **[weapon systems]{.underline}** in its inventory.
Thus, if [we want to **build** mutual **confidence** and]{.underline}
**[trust]{.underline}**, [we are left either to add
**discussions**]{.underline} on such systems [to]{.underline} existing
[dialogues on]{.underline} cyber**[security]{.underline}** and arms
control more broadly or to begin with new dialogues on approaches to
repurposable civilian capabilities. The latter might be a more
productive venue for engaging the private sector, which is wary of being
stigmatized by civil society as the maker or facilitator of "killer
robots." Tagging on discussions of AI to cybersecurity or traditional
arms control would also be unhelpful because of the risk of false
analogies.

Thus, [new]{.underline} innovatively structured
**[dialogues]{.underline}** in the track setting (involving both
government and nongovernmental parties) or the track setting
([involving]{.underline} artificial intelligence and **[international
security]{.underline}** only informal nongovernmental parties) [are
**required**]{.underline}. [The first objective should be to **enhance**
mutual]{.underline} **[understanding]{.underline}** [through in-depth
discussions on **national** approaches **to AI
development**]{.underline}, **[testing]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[validation]{.underline}**, [deployment, and use]{.underline}.
[Another objective should be to allow some **sharing** of **best
practices**]{.underline} or cautionary experiences. A third potential
objective would be to shift thinking from zerosum competitive approaches
to collaborative problem-solving using data and algorithmic insights
pooled by the participants themselves or put in escrow with a trusted
third party.

**[Agreement on norms]{.underline}** to govern the military use of AI
[could take time, but influencing the direction of such use by other
means]{.underline} **[brooks no delay]{.underline}**. One important
channel for shaping AI use globally is guiding principles short of
binding law. At a time [when there are **trust deficits** among
**nations** and]{.underline} **[multilateral negotiations]{.underline}**
[are at best seen as opportunities for "**lawfare**,"]{.underline} it
makes sense to rally around shared values and ethical principles. [In
the context of emerging technologies, such an approach also permits more
of an impact early on in the **innovation cycle**]{.underline}, when
national or international regulatory reach is absent or ambiguous.
Consistent with this logic, the EU High-Level Expert Group on Artificial
Intelligence has identified five principles---beneficence,
nonmaleficence, autonomy of humans, justice, and explicability---for the
trustworthy and ethical development of AI.

More specifically, [in]{.underline} the context of **[military
use]{.underline}**, [in the Group of Governmental Experts]{.underline}
of the Convention on Certain Conventional [Weapons on emerging
technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapon systems
(**LAWS**]{.underline}), [comprised of states and including all
**countries** thought]{.underline} to be **[pursuing national security
applications]{.underline}** of AI, identified ten guiding principles on
emerging technologies in the area of LAWS. These principles cover
aspects related to the applicability of international humanitarian law,
human responsibility, accountability, risk assessment and mitigation,
and the need to take a nonanthropomorphic view of such systems. The
guiding principles are accompanied by building blocks of common
understandings on definitions and the nature of human intervention
required throughout the various stages of technology development and
deployment to uphold compliance with international law, in particular
international humanitarian law.

Another channel for the soft governance of AI could be engineering
standards and codes. At a minimum, a common vocabulary for assessing
risks and aligning design with safety and reliability considerations is
needed. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' Global
Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems has started
building a shared, multidisciplinary, and evolving resource of terms.
There is further scope for constructing common standards that can
progressively align practices around the globe to responsible
principles.

Last Word

[There is a growing concern over the **repurposing of AI
technologies**]{.underline} for warfare. As with cyber weapons, [LAWS
could have indiscriminate effects]{.underline} and be turned around to
attack the attackers.They can create challenges for the application of
international humanitarian law principles, such as distinction,
proportionality, and precaution, all of which presuppose a degree of
human reflection and control. [Their international **security
implications** are still **unfolding** but could be as **significant as
the nuclear revolution**]{.underline} [in warfare]{.underline}, if not
more so. [Innovative and agile ways of **governing** the]{.underline}
use of **[AI]{.underline}** [are **needed urgently**]{.underline} [to
head off risks to **international peace**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[security]{.underline}**.

6\. The two faces of security -- and of peace [Security]{.underline},
especially [[state security]{.mark}, tends to be enacted in contexts of
the violently contested **political authority**]{.underline}.
[[Often]{.mark} it [is enacted through **violent
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rebranded as legitimate force. Small
wonder that some in the development community, including those who
drafted SDG 16, hesitate to use the word at all. [But [**although**
security is]{.mark} a **[deeply disputed]{.mark}** idea, [it is]{.mark}
also a **[highly]{.mark} [necessary]{.mark}** one]{.underline}.
[Security functions simultaneously as an analytical construct, as a
**frame for policy** and as a **moral narrative**]{.underline}. It is
distinct from the equally ambiguous if less contentious concept of
peace. Yet, at the same time, [it is]{.underline} often seen as
[**essential** [to the preservation of **peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Most of the things that international decision-makers, political and
security elites and development practitioners do in security's name are
supposed to protect the safety and welfare of people in a world of
multiple challenges and threats. However, [there is a tendency to slide
from **global**, to **national**, to **citizen** and to human security
and back again, without enough serious reflection on how they
**interconnect**]{.underline} and on where tensions and contradictions
lie hidden. Development agencies have too often plunged into security
policies and programmes, without a clear understanding of where they
might lead, who would benefit and how they might go wrong. The
ambiguities stem in part from a deep-seated tension between two distinct
visions of security (summarised in Table 3), which interconnect, yet are
in deep tension with eachother. [On the **one hand**]{.underline},
[[security]{.mark} can be seen as a process of political and social
ordering, aiming to reduce violence and keep the peace]{.underline}. As
such it is territorially organised and kept in place globally as well as
nationally through the authoritative discourses and practices of power,
including socially sanctioned violence. [[It connects to]{.mark}
conceptions of what Galtung termed '[negative peace']{.mark}: the
[ending]{.mark} of overt [violence, without]{.mark} necessarily
**[transforming]{.mark} the [conditions]{.mark}** giving rise to this
violence]{.underline} [or attending to the **quality** of the
**subsequent peace**]{.underline}. In this view security is a public
good delivered in principle by states, much like official or
donor-driven development.29 Yet in a world where states and indeed the
international order face sustained challenges, security is often kept in
place also through alternative nonstate or 'hybrid' networks of violence
and protection.30 Moreover, security is far from being an unalloyed
public good. In principle, it is equally shared and socially inclusive,
even if in practice it is anything but, especially at the insurgent
margins where insecurity is most acute. For [in practice [it
protects]{.mark} **socially [embedded power]{.mark}**, established
property relations and **social privilege** -- and reinforces global,
national and local **inequalities**]{.underline}. [[On the **other
hand**, security can be seen]{.underline}]{.mark} (in the vernacular)
[[as an **entitlement**]{.mark} **of citizens**]{.underline} and more
widely human beings [[to **social peace**]{.mark} and [**protection from
violence**,]{.mark} [abuses of **rights**]{.mark} and [**social
injustice**, along with]{.mark} other [**existential risks** such as
**famine** or **disease**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It connects to]{.mark}
the idea of '**[positive peace']{.mark}**, including **transformations**
in the social conditions giving rise to violence and [deepening]{.mark}
the **[relationships]{.mark} between states and** their
**citizens**]{.underline}. The vernacular understandings, day-to-day
experience, resilience and agency of the people and groups who are
'secured' and 'developed' are in this view the touchstone by which to
evaluate security and violence reduction[. Most [people **fall
back**]{.mark} up[on]{.mark} their **[social identities]{.mark}** -- as
women and men, members of families, clans, castes, [ethnic
groups]{.mark}, sects, religions and [nationalities]{.mark} -- [to
navigate]{.mark} their [social worlds]{.mark}, [to **respond to
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline} and violence and (sometimes) to
organise for violence. At the same time, [[these]{.mark} [**identities**
are **written into**]{.mark} the **[structures of]{.mark} power and
[inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [being [deployed to **establish
hierarchies of citizenship**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **patterns of
[exclusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ensuring that security is inclusive
and not simply the security of particular groups or the property of the
well-armed, powerful and wealthy, is fraught with difficulty and must be
negotiated at multiple levels. 'Security in the vernacular' is the term
used here rather than the interlinked but distinct concepts of 'human
security' and of 'citizen security' popularised by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank,31 which fit in the
conceptual toolboxes of development practitioners, humanitarian agencies
and intervention forces. Both human and citizen security have come under
criticism for 'securitising' development by framing poverty, exclusion
and vulnerability through security lenses, and thus paving the way for
military interventions in the affairs of fragile states.32 '[**[Security
in the vernacular]{.mark}'** paves the way for more precise and detailed
empirical scrutiny of how security and plays out in particular local and
national contexts. It highlights the experience and social agency of
those who are 'secured'. And it [underscores]{.mark} the [transformative
potential]{.mark} of security as an **entitlement**]{.underline}, [which
can be **actively claimed** by those who **challenge** the **deeply
rooted legacies** of **insecurity**, **exclusion** and
**injustice**]{.underline}. Both these faces of security have their
underside, most obviously the first. 'Seeing like a state' even with the
best of intentions can lead to the interests of citizens being
sacrificed to an unbending vision of national security or of top-down
development (as even in Nyerere's Tanzania).33 It is also open to abuse
-- for instance, to prop up authoritarian regimes; to advance the
interests of predatory elites; to impose exclusionary economic and
social policies; to justify state secrecy and surveillance of citizens;
or to justify the hegemonies and military adventurism of major world
powers. And it tends to be closely if complexly related to 'seeing like
a corporation', most obviously in enclave economies, where privatised
security arrangements in protected enclaves may indeed destabilise or
weaken the state.34 The [**deformations** of **security in the
vernacular** tend to be more hidden]{.underline}, but no less damaging
-- for instance, [the submission of minorities and refugees to campaigns
of exclusion and violence by populist majorities]{.underline}; [forms of
**popular justice** that **violate the rights**]{.underline}, dignity
and safety of supposed perpetrators; or grass roots endorsement of
'traditional' or customary institutions, which perpetuate gender and
other inequities. Moreover, local-level insecurities can persist or even
worsen, when a state, like India or Brazil, is considered to be stable,
or a region or locality is considered to be secure. Neither face of
security can be considered without the other. The relationship between
them is utterly crucial. The capacity of states to protect their
citizens is at the basis of the social contract.35 That is, [the rights
and security of citizens]{.underline} and people [are the bedrock of
state and international security -- or at least they **should
be**]{.underline}. But [these entitlements cannot be protected without
some kind of **social order**]{.underline}, however achieved. [And how
and by whom social order is assured are both **affairs of governance**
and **vital concerns** for **everyone** who lives under the **leaky
umbrella** of **political authority**]{.underline}. **[[Political
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[durable
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the]{.underline} [**[rule of
law]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[effective and
[accountable security apparatuses]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[are]{.underline}**]{.mark} not just **[[desirable]{.mark} attributes
of states]{.underline}** but are also in many respects conditions of the
security of people. However, [[they]{.mark} **[come at a
price]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not just in taxes, but also [[because of
the need for **constant vigilance**]{.mark} to ensure that those charged
with delivering security do not ignore or still worse violate the
entitlements of those they are supposed to protect]{.underline}.

Overall workshop participants agreed that [**AI has significant
potential to upset the foundations of nuclear stability and undermine
deterrence by the year 2040,** especially in the increasingly multipolar
strategic environment.]{.underline} [Dismissing the Hollywood nightmare
of malevolent AIs trying to destroy humanity with nuclear weapons,
experts were instead concerned with more-mundane issues arising from
improving capabilities.]{.underline} AI applications discussed included
the ability to track and target adversary launchers for counterforce
targeting and the incorporation of AI into decision support systems
informing choices about the use of nuclear weapons.

[Some experts fear that an increased reliance on AI could lead to new
types of **catastrophic mistakes.** There may be pressure to use it
**before it is technologically mature**; it may be **susceptible** to
**adversarial subversion**; or adversaries may believe that the AI is
more capable than it is, leading them to make **catastrophic
mistakes**.]{.underline}

On the other hand, [if the nuclear powers manage to **establish a form
of strategic stability** compatible with the emerging capabilities that
AI might provide, the machines could **reduce distrust** and **alleviate
international tensions**, thereby **decreasing the risk of nuclear
war.**]{.underline}

[At present, we cannot predict which---if any---of these scenarios will
come to pass,]{.underline} but [**we need to begin considering the
potential impact of AI on nuclear security before these challenges
become acute**.]{.underline} [Maintaining strategic stability in the
coming decades may prove extremely difficult]{.underline}, and all
nuclear powers will have to participate in the cultivation of
institutions to help limit nuclear risk. This goal will demand a
fortuitous combination of technological, military, and diplomatic
measures that will require rival states to cooperate. We hope that this
Perspective will begin that discussion and open a path toward pragmatism
and realism on these controversial and often polarizing topics.

**[2AC\-\--Securitization Inev]{.underline}**

**AI representations by foreign actors mean securitization is
inevitable**

Department of Politics, Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster University

<https://doi-org.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/10.1093/cjip/poab005>

Geopolitically speaking, [**China's national approach towards AI and
moves to make it a security matter are fuelled by ever more competitive
United States--China relations. Each side's perception of the other's AI
advancement as a threat accelerates the securitization process.** In the
domestic arena, where the primary concern is the regime security of the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP),]{.underline} **[the practical use of AI
and its relevant discourses are geared to securing authoritarian
rule]{.underline}**. In this regard[, China's bold AI experiments
practice a unique digital technocracy, making its AI approach quite
distinct from that in Western societies.]{.underline}

Currently, [this securitization is an ongoing process]{.underline}.
Although [**the extent of its impact on targeted audiences**, namely,
local governments, market actors, intellectuals, and the general
public**, remains unclear, all nevertheless enthusiastically echo the
central government's AI campaign**]{.underline}. In this regard, [such
securitization appears to convince domestic actors]{.underline}.
However**[, it also generates unintended consequences]{.underline}**.
They are: (i) **[creation of a nationalistic environment that makes
China less attractive to global AI labor and capital]{.underline}**;
(ii) **[impaired industrial efficiency by virtue of focusing on
self-reliance]{.underline}**; (iii) **[obstruction of China's global AI
governance leadership]{.underline}**; (iv) **[reinforced technological
rivalry due to disregard for potential global AI
cooperation]{.underline}**; and (v) **[constraints on the global access
of Chinese AI companies]{.underline}**. [All could undermine China's key
objectives of fostering a booming AI economy and becoming a global AI
leader.]{.underline}

Indeed, [**securitization of AI has progressively become a global
movement**. In the United States and Europe, for example, **the AI
advancements of geopolitical competitors, especially Russia and China,
are often perceived as a potential threat to national and international
security**]{.underline}. [The relevant speech act frames AI not as a
normal technology, but as a national security matter that **justifies
the enablement of extraordinary actions from the state and
society**.]{.underline} In effect, [it signifies the urgent need to
deploy more resources and support, for example, in the US case, not only
to the American AI-enabled military sector, but also the AI commercial
industry.]{.underline}

This article focuses on how AI is securitized within China. [Needless to
say, **the securitization process works differently in the Chinese
context, given its unique state-society relations**]{.underline}.
[Despite a non-liberal democratic setting, however**, there is still a
need to convince the domestic audience and thus win more support for
China's national AI plan**]{.underline}. Table 1 categorizes the
arguments into the securitization framework. It argues that [the Chinese
central government, as the securitizing actor, is performing a
securitizing move by labeling China's AI advancement as a matter of
security.]{.underline} In the relevant discourses, the national
interests and survival of the Chinese nation constitute the referent
object that needs to be protected[. As part of the central government's
AI campaign to mobilize domestic actors, this performative act aims to
convince the domestic audience including local, subnational, academic
actors, market actors,]{.underline} and the mass, as the rest of the
article will explore.

[The relevant securitizing move belongs to the type of securitization
referring to a directive elementary speech whose aim is to raise an item
on the agenda]{.underline}.36 **[It consists of "three sequential,
elementary speech acts," including claim, warn, and
request.]{.underline}**37 In this case, [the State Council of China aims
to raise its audience's awareness of AI's importance, and requests the
relevant actions]{.underline}. As the quote at the beginning of the
article claims and warns, **[other countries (i.e. China's competitors)
are elevating AI as a significant national strategy for the sake of
national security.]{.underline}**

The document also claims that, **[as China lacks significant original AI
innovations, China's overall AI development lags behind that of other
great powers]{.underline}**.38 As such, **[it requests the nation's
prioritization of AI advancement to protect national
security]{.underline}**. [On the heels of this request comes the setting
of the broad goal to make China a leading AI power, along with a
three-step plan and a targeted timeline to]{.underline}: (i) **[catch up
with the AI technological progress of world-leading countries such as
the United States by 2020]{.underline}**; (ii) **[make major
breakthroughs in certain AI technologies by 2025]{.underline}**; and
(iii) **[become a global leading AI power by 2030]{.underline}**.39 In
short, **[the Chinese central government is labeling AI as a national
security matter and highlighting the threat of falling behind in efforts
to convince domestic actors to support its action plan.]{.underline}**

[The serious damage American sanctions have inflicted on Chinese tech
companies **has heightened China's awareness of both its technological
weakness and feelings of insecurity in regard to global
reliance**]{.underline}. Understandably, therefore, **[China wants to
master leading AI technology independently]{.underline}**. As Xi Jinping
elaborates:

[accelerating the development of a new generation of AI is an important
strategic handhold for China to gain the initiative in global science
and technology competition...**We need to ensure that the core AI
technologies are firmly in our own hands.**]{.underline}62

[China's AI aspirations extend to global leadership]{.underline}. Since
China's rise, the US-led global order has left China dissatisfied due to
the limits it places on China's say in global norms and rules.63 Rather
than a norm-taker, China now aspires to be a norm-shaper, or even a
norm-maker. Many Chinese scholars argue that current established norms
are geared primarily to serving interests other than those of China.64
[To maximize Chinese interests, therefore, future norms should be
defined by/for China, and on Chinese terms.]{.underline}

In addition to history and geopolitics**[, China's securitizing move
also has a domestic context]{.underline}**. Certain [scholars see AI as
exerting two types of impact on China's national security---traditional
and non-traditional]{.underline}.80 [**The former refers to the military
threat**, namely the aforementioned use of AI in warfare; **the latter
includes such non-military sources as political security, economic
security, environmental security, cyber security, and energy
security**]{.underline}.81 However**[, most important is the so-called
political security (政治安全) or institutional security (制度安全),
i.e., regime security.]{.underline}**

As far as regime security is concerned, [the bold and controversial AI
practices China applies to state governance is an inevitable
topic]{.underline}. As part of the CCP's adaptation strategy in the
digital age, **[China has invested heavily in AI technologies in order
to advance towards digital governance]{.underline}**. Such **[AI
investment expects returns in the form of improved public services (by
enhancing efficiency), and maintenance of authoritarian
rule.]{.underline}**82 [AI's empowerment of digital surveillance is
widely discussed among international analysts, having been used to
upgrade China's sophisticated state surveillance program and potentially
reshape state-society relations]{.underline}.83 Although
similar---though less intensive and extensive---[AI surveillance
programs have been implemented worldwide, due to privacy concerns they
have met with considerable social resistance in Western societies in
efforts to balance states' use of AI]{.underline}.84 **[In China,
however, there is scant legal constraint on the relevant AI
practices]{.underline}**. For example, [China has pioneered AI facial
recognition technology, which has been restricted, or even banned in
many Western societie]{.underline}s. Meanwhile, to reduce social
resistance[, **the Chinese government has proactively guided public
opinion on AI by framing it as positive and modern social progress that
is of enormous benefit in securing public safety,**]{.underline} as will
be discussed later.

**[Certain Chinese scholars also link AI with economic
security.]{.underline}** Li Zheng from the China Institutes of
Contemporary International Relations, for example, holds that
[sustaining the current socialist market economy with Chinese
characteristics is the core of China's economic security]{.underline}.85
In essence**[, this economic security extends to regime security, i.e.,
securing the CCP's rule]{.underline}**. In spite of its quasi-capitalist
market reforms, [the CCP's economic policies have always been
constrained by its ideological commitment to being a communist
entity]{.underline}.86 Thus, in the interests of its political
legitimacy, [the CCP must uphold certain socialist
responsibilities]{.underline}. Li argues that **[AI will be able not
only to improve socioeconomic governance, including market supervision,
and fight economic crime, but also strengthen the CCP's capability to
manage the macro and microeconomy]{.underline}**.87

**[This article shows that the Chinese central government is performing
a securitizing move by labeling AI as a security matter in order to
convince local states, market actors, intellectuals, and the general
public]{.underline}**. But if AI is indeed being securitized, so what[?
Although it is difficult to quantify the exact impact of this
securitizing move, it undoubtedly helps the Chinese central government's
mobilization of domestic actors towards advancing its AI
agenda]{.underline}. Nevertheless, this move also generates unintended
consequences for the securitizing actor's goal in the long run.
According to the State Council's AI plans, its three-step AI plan
carries the specific goals of fostering a booming AI economy, and a
grand goal of becoming a global AI leader.125 Securitization may
undermine these key objectives for several reasons.

First, a highly securitized AI sector will affect the flow of foreign AI
labor and capital to China's AI industry. To make it attractive to
global talent and capital, a booming AI industry requires an
outward-looking, open-minded, and international socio-politico-economic
environment. However, the securitization trend is pushing in the
opposite direction by producing a rising nationalistic, inward-looking,
security AI discourse. This is counterproductive to China's AI
ambitions, because it puts China at a disadvantage in the global market.
More specifically, there is a global shortage of AI talent and, as
previously mentioned, China is short of 5 million or more qualified AI
industry workers. This has led to fierce global competition in the AI
industry for qualified workers, to the extent where Chinese tech
companies offer extremely---or unreasonably---high salaries.126 Such
financial attraction, however, could be offset by an unfavorably
nationalistic domestic environment.

Second, the securitization trend could hinder economic efficiency. As
previously discussed, it contributes to the rise of a self-reliance
discourse on technology whose creation is often at the cost of economic
efficiency. Precisely because China is lagging behind in AI development,
it needs to make use of the global AI supply chain to catch up. However,
the self-reliance discourse considers the risk of relying on foreign
technology too high, and thus focuses on "Made in China." Such
self-reliance is difficult (if not impossible) to realize in the short
run, and hinders China's ability to benefit from the global AI market
and thus maximize industrial efficiency. Similarly, the securitization
of AI in the United States also undermines the appeal that America holds
for Chinese national AI talent, capital, and technology. Growing tension
between China and the United States has, moreover, undermined Chinese
companies' willingness to invest in the United States. In the long run,
therefore, securitization is detrimental to the competitiveness of the
American AI industry.

Third, in connection with the above paragraph, the domestic
inward-looking nationalistic trend that securitization has created
hinders China's realization of global leadership. To lead AI in the
global arena, China must provide public goods and win support from
others through successful partnerships. It must play a key role in
promoting global governance and, as a global leader, act according to
common interests rather than solely national interests. However, a
security-focused, inward-looking, nationalistic AI discourse is helpful
to neither global governance nor common interests. For example, it can
foster the rise of inward-looking national AI policies that prioritize
national interests over those of the globalized world. This is in direct
contrast to global governance goals, i.e., to build a shared future
through global solidarity. Indeed, many of the problems that AI has
created, such as those relating to ethics, represent collective
challenges to humankind that require a globally concerted response.
Inward-looking national AI policies may contribute to a fragmented
global governance structure, and thus obstruct concerted global actions
to address AI problems.

Fourth**[, the securitization trend has reinforced technological rivalry
at the expense of the potential for global AI cooperation, and will
likely exacerbate the United States--China confrontation]{.underline}**.
[This is not to deny the existence of United States--China cooperation
in the field of AI]{.underline}. [However, **by speaking of AI in the
language of security and a global race, the relevant security AI
discourse emphasizes competition over cooperation and destruction over
creation.**]{.underline} [This may produce a real security threat, and
perhaps an actual global AI race, thus undermining the space for
cooperation from which both the United States and China can
benefit.]{.underline} In other words**[, the rivalry discourse adopts a
zero-sum geopolitical angle for understanding AI innovation that is
inevitably to the latter's detriment in both
countries.]{.underline}**127

More importantly, **[securitization may push AI further into the hard
security area by virtue of its military applications]{.underline}**.
[The securitizing actor tends to exaggerate the security threat to
achieve a successful securitization, so enhancing the strategic risks of
AI military practices and increasing the likelihood of war, and of
escalating ongoing conflicts]{.underline}. [**In this regard, a highly
securitized AI politics may set China and the United States on a
dangerous path towards a catastrophic confrontation that imperils
everyone's interests and security**. In the worst case scenario, as in
all arms races, **blithe assertions about the inevitability of
AI-enabled war are a self-fulfilling and self-defeating
prophecy.**]{.underline} In this regard, the aforementioned Fu Ying's
call to regulate AI's military application merits more attention.

Lastly, by strengthening state involvement in China's AI industry,
**[securitization may undermine the interests of Chinese AI
companies]{.underline}**. [The boundary between the state and the market
is always far less defined in China than in other countries, due to
China's political environment]{.underline}. [**Making AI a national
security matter justifies the necessity for heavier state involvement,
if not control**.]{.underline} Although a blessing in the Chinese
domestic market, **[close ties with the state are a burden on the global
stage]{.underline}**. [Take the aforementioned civil-military
integration]{.underline} as an example. [Although helpful in gaining
China's AI companies and research institutes more state funding, it
undermines their global access]{.underline}. **[Close relations with the
Chinese government have caused certain Chinese AI companies, including
members of the "national AI team of China," to be subjected to
punishment, in the form of the aforementioned American
sanctions]{.underline}**. In this regard, **[securitization could hinder
the access of China's AI companies to the global market, and hence their
future development]{.underline}**. [It also remains to be seen whether
heavier state involvement in the AI industry hinders market
efficiency.]{.underline}

How AI Could Enhance Chinese Capability

[The most likely sources of a potential U.S.-Chinese
conflict]{.underline}, [such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or a
contest over some South China Sea feature]{.underline}, [would likely
feature the full spectrum of]{.underline} civil and military information
[operations aimed at deterring U.S. intervention and degrading U.S.
allies']{.underline} will to fight. AI could play a dominant role in
each of these missions. The Network Systems Department of [the People's
Liberation Army]{.underline}, for example, [may try using generative
language models to synthesize and amplify content on Facebook and
Instagram]{.underline}, [as it has done]{.underline} using botnets and
other non-AI tools [around Taiwanese elections]{.underline}. [The
Chinese military is]{.underline} also [likely to wage a similar campaign
to discredit U.S. military activities or sow division with partners,
including Australia and Japan]{.underline}.

Soon after the start of a conflict, [the People's Liberation Army would
likely attack U.S. sensor and communication networks]{.underline}, and
several different kinds of machine-learning applications could aid this
task. A cadre of [scientists at the People's Liberation Army National
University of Defense Technology]{.underline}, for example, [specializes
in "fuzzing,"]{.underline} [using machine learning to identify
vulnerabilities in an adversary's computer networks.]{.underline}
Experts also point to AI's role in attacking or defending critical
infrastructure in Taiwan, Japan, Australia, or the United States.

[Chinese planners]{.underline} also [aim to use AI for electronic
countermeasures and operations across the electromagnetic
spectrum]{.underline}. For example, analysts from anquan neican (a
Chinese journal for cybersecurity research) are optimistic about
[cognitive electronic warfare]{.underline} --- [using AI to analyze
incoming radar signals]{.underline}, and then [automatically adapting
one's own output to optimize jamming]{.underline}. But several other
applications of AI also play a role in electronic spectrum operations.
[In 2020]{.underline}, for example, [the People's Liberation Army
awarded equipment contracts for swarms of drones equipped with modular
radar-jamming systems]{.underline}, [which could be flown near U.S.
carrier strike groups]{.underline}, military [installations in Japan and
South Korea]{.underline}, or shared [facilities in the
Philippines]{.underline}. [Many systems under development]{.underline}
by Chinese universities and military research institutions [are
explicitly designed to counter U.S. drone systems and swarm
concepts]{.underline}. [Chinese companies have]{.underline} already
exported [drones to Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, and
Egypt]{.underline}, among others. However, while some People's
Liberation Army experts contend that these drones have been "battle
tested," others are less sanguine about their capabilities in a real
conflict.

Moreover, [the People's Liberation Army may]{.underline} attempt to [use
AI to enhance the lethality and reach of]{.underline} its [surface ships
and anti-access and area denial systems]{.underline}, [which could hold
U.S. forces at risk during a crisis]{.underline}. China's current
approach to territorial defense relies on hundreds of short- to
long-range ballistic missiles that would target U.S. aircraft carriers
and strike aircraft based in mainland Japan, Okinawa, South Korea, and
as far away as Guam. [As early as 2016]{.underline}, [Wang
Changqing]{.underline}, [director of the General Design Department of
the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation]{.underline},
[claimed that the company's next generation of cruise missiles would use
AI to adapt to specific combat conditions]{.underline}, being [capable
of adjusting flight profiles and even warhead yield]{.underline}.
Chinese defense industry engineers appear inspired by the U.S.
Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, which uses AI to improve accuracy and
achieve more flexible targeting.

Finally, t[he People's Liberation Army is building a wide array of
autonomous vehicles and extensive undersea sensor networks that make use
of AI and big-data analytics.]{.underline} [These systems may be useful
in recording and transmitting the locations of U.S. undersea
vehicles]{.underline}, and would be crucial to [overcoming the Chinese
military's disadvantages in undersea warfare]{.underline}. [Large
unmanned submarines]{.underline}, such as the HSU-001 and Haishen-6000,
[could be equipped with sea mines to deny the U.S. Navy access to
undersea space between the first and second island chains]{.underline},
[or to restrict access to the Taiwan or Luzon Straits.]{.underline}

Of course, [AI has the potential to revolutionize Chinese
operations]{.underline} in countless other ways, including [through
predictive maintenance, logistics, and back-office tasks]{.underline}
not discussed in depth in this article. In any case, it is clear that
[the People's Liberation Army is banking on the technology to create
asymmetric advantages vis-a-vis the United States.]{.underline}

The Threat of Biological Weapons: [A **Justification** of Biological
Weapons **Securitization**]{.underline}

1\. Introduction

In 2001, when [attacks were carried out]{.underline} in the United
States [involving]{.underline} Bacillus [anthracis]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} bacterial [agent]{.underline} that causes anthrax,
[the threat of biological weapons came into **sharper
focus**]{.underline} for the American government. [These attacks were
not the beginning of the biological weapons threat]{.underline}, [but
rather a point along a **continuum**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
increasing **[risk]{.underline}**. Article 1 of the 1972 Biological
Weapons Convention defines biological weapons to include the "microbial
or other biological agents, or toxins, whatever their origin or method
of production, of types and in quantities that have no justification for
prophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes" as well as the
"weapons, equipment, or means of delivery designed to use such agents or
toxins for hostile purposes or in armed conflict"1. The use of
biological weapons dates back centuries, but the fear of biological
weapons of mass destruction, here defined as weapons that pose an
existential threat to the target, is relatively recent2. Much of it is
attributable to the rapid advances made in the biological sciences over
the past decade, particularly with respect to the field of genomics,
where there is a growing ability to manipulate genes3. This knowledge
has a variety of applications in the field of bioweapons. Additionally,
while states use of biological weapons was a concern through much of the
20th century, the possibility that rogue states or non-state groups
would use biological weapons was largely ignored until the start of the
21st century1.

Therefore, [the **threat** of biological **weapons** has been framed as
a **security issue**]{.underline} 4. This essay examines whether, and to
what degree, the threat of a biological weapons attack has been
overstated with respect to the government's response by drawing on
securitization theory, which critically evaluates the process through
which an issue comes to be viewed through a security framework. In
addition, the essay will also use the precautionary principle, described
by the 1998 Wingspread Statement as the notion that "when an activity
raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary
measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are
not fully established scientifically"5. Though more often applied to
considerations of environmental risk, in the case of biological weapons,
the principle could be used to justify caution even in the absence of
consensus surrounding the probability of an attack, simply due to the
severity of the consequences if an attack was to occur.

It will be argued that [the]{.underline} **[biological
weapons]{.underline}** [threat has **not** been **overestimated** and
that the biodefense measures **expressed**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
**[current]{.underline}** **[policy]{.underline}** [and funding
decisions **are warranted**]{.underline}. [Despite measures such as
**likelihood-adjusted mortality**]{.underline}, [which may suggest the
U.S. government]{.underline} [response is an
**overreaction**]{.underline}, [other characteristics of the bioweapons
threat **justify** its **securitization**]{.underline} [and resulting
**prioritization** in the]{.underline} **[government
agenda]{.underline}**. To do this, [the essay provides a discussion of
how the potential **consequences**]{.underline} of [an attack pose an
**existential threat**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [the United
States]{.underline}, how [there is an **inadequate degree**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[preparedness]{.underline}** for such an event, how
[the]{.underline} [**mere possibility** of an attack is enough to
warrant **high spending** on **preventive**]{.underline} and preparative
**[programs]{.underline}**, and how [the response has been
**appropriately measured**]{.underline} [given the threat]{.underline}.
The focus will be on the United States government because it has taken
such a prominent role in bioweapon securitization and biodefense
funding. A single country, the US, was chosen as a point of focus to
avoid confusion due to differing levels of threat and response across
countries. Additionally, any exaggerations that may exist in how the
media or the public portray and view the biological weapons threat will
be ignored; though this could be related to the government's decision to
securitize bioweapons, this is a separate issue from government policy
decisions in response to the security threat and is outside the scope of
this paper.

2\. Securitization Theory and Biological Weapons

Securitization theory is a constructivist approach informing how certain
issues become framed through a security lens6. It offers a useful
analytical framework for understanding how, why, and what issues come to
be viewed as security threats. [Securitization is an active
process]{.underline} wherein a [securitizing]{.underline}
[actor]{.underline}, in this case the American government, [presents and
addresses an issue as an **existential threat**]{.underline} [to
a]{.underline} particular [group, or referent]{.underline} object7. In
these situations, [emergency response measures and **extensive**
resource]{.underline} **[commitments]{.underline}** [are considered
**justified7**]{.underline}. [Securitization theory generally
promotes]{.underline} **[desecuritization]{.underline}**
[as]{.underline} **[preferable]{.underline}** because it avoids the
negative consequences of securitization, including a heavy-handed state
response, reduced democratic accountability, and the narrowing of public
choice8. [However, it also recognizes that **securitization** is
**sometimes appropriate**]{.underline}. Recent considerations of
securitization theory identify three criteria that, if fulfilled,
justify securitization: an objective, existential threat, a referent
object whose protection promotes human well-being, and a response
appropriately measured to the particular threat6.

In the case of bioweapons securitization, the second criterion is less
controversial, given that the referent object is human population; thus,
any harm to the referent object would directly reduce a human
well-being. However, the question of whether securitization of
biological weapons meets the other two criteria is more contentious.
[Skeptics]{.underline} may [point to Colin Powell's]{.underline} 2003
[address]{.underline} to the United Nations as a case where the
biological weapons security threat may have been exaggerated and
securitization was promoted for political ends, thereby [calling into
question the **legitimacy**]{.underline} of the securitizing actor, [the
U.S. government. In his speech, Powell made the case for an **invasion
of Iraq**]{.underline} [by claiming Iraq had capabilities to produce
**biological weapons**]{.underline} of mass destruction, including
mobile bioweapons labs, a claim that later turned out to be false9.

Critics also target the policies resulting from securitization, arguing
that the capacity of aggressors to carry out large scale attacks causing
mortality has been overestimated, calling into question whether an
existential threat truly exists and whether the response has been
appropriately measured10. Government funding may be seen as
unjustifiably skewed in favour of biodefense, defined as the capacity to
respond to a biological weapons attack, to the neglect of other key
areas, such as endemic and pandemic diseases. For instance, Klotz
calculated what is referred as the "likelihood-adjusted mortality" for
biological weapons, pandemic diseases, and endemic diseases by
multiplying the probability of occurrence by an estimate of mortality
were an event to occur11. By comparing these values with government
funding allocated to each category, he demonstrated that biodefense
receives more funding than its likelihood-adjusted mortality estimate
would suggest is warranted11.

[However]{.underline}, [objections have been raised to this
argument]{.underline}. [Supporters of **biodefense
prioritization**]{.underline} [point to the fact that focusing
**solely**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} **[potential
fatalities]{.underline}** [ignores **other issues,** such]{.underline}
[as the negative **social** and **economic fallout**]{.underline} [from
an attack12]{.underline}. Additionally, [they point to the possibility
that it is more **expensive**]{.underline} [to combat **intentional
threats**, where there will be an **explicit effort** to
**circumvent**]{.underline} current **[practices]{.underline}** [by
exploiting weaknesses12]{.underline}. It [should also be considered that
the **probability** of **one attack** is **not independent** from
another]{.underline}, [and that an increasing probability of **success**
may elicit]{.underline} **[more attempts12]{.underline}**. To follow
will be an examination of whether government spending and policies
constitute a justified response to the threat of biological weapons.
Securitization is relevant in that it was a way for decision-makers to
implement the policies they want and is justifiable to the extent that
the programs themselves are necessary and appropriate. Despite other
consequences of securitization, such as public fear, political
manipulation, and a heavy-handed response, which may give the impression
of an overreaction, the reality is that securitization was a means of
enabling the implementation of certain policies and programs necessary
to respond to the threat of biological weapons.

3\. [Consequences of an Attack]{.underline}

A government's decision to securitize an issue is a strategy to make
extreme responses seem justified, and it centers on the perceived
existential risk a threat poses to the population7. Beginning with a
brief history of biological weapons use, this section will aim to defend
the framing of biological weapons use as an existential threat by
examining their ability to cause mortality or to generate negative
social and economic fallout. A brief discussion of the potential
catastrophic consequences of a smallpox attack will illustrate the
argument.

[The use of **biological weapons** dates back
**centuries**]{.underline}. Examples include the Tatars catapulting
plague-infected corpses over city walls at the siege of Kaffa in the
14th century, the deliberate triggering of a smallpox epidemic among
Native Americans via contaminated blankets in the 18th century during
the French and Indian War, and the contamination of salad bars with
salmonella at a restaurant in Oregon in the 20th century2. However, with
the development of the germ theory during the 19th and into the 20th
century, there was an increase in scientific knowledge about biological
weapons10. States became increasingly interested in such weapons, with
Japan establishing a bioweapons program between 1932-1945, the United
States in 1942, and the Soviet Union in 197313. In 1972, in response to
increasing concern about the threat of biological weapons, the United
Nations proposed the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,
Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin
Weapons and on their Destruction, more commonly known as the Biological
Weapons Convention (or BWC)14. The treaty came into effect in 1975, and
banned the development, acquisition, and stockpiling of biological
weapons1. However, it failed to halt the research and development of
biological weapons, which have continued into the 21st century.

[Those who argue that government response to the **biological
weapons**]{.underline} [threat has been **overstated**]{.underline}
[point to very **low mortality**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
**[previous attacks11]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} [anthrax attacks
of 2001 in the United States, for example, resulted in only 5
deaths15]{.underline}. [This argument could be used to urge
**governments**]{.underline} [to instead invest resources in **areas**
that consistently cause **higher mortality**]{.underline}, [such as
**infectious diseases**]{.underline} like AIDS or even the seasonal flu.
[However, in carrying out a threat assessment, it is also important to
look at the **potential**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
**[mortality]{.underline}**. [Here it has been suggested future attacks
may **not** be on the same relatively **small**]{.underline}
**[scale]{.underline}** as [those in the past15. It is difficult to
produce **reliable estimates**]{.underline} of fatalities that might
result from an attack; there is huge variation in estimates and, often,
little statistical evidence to support the predictions11. That said, [it
is agreed that]{.underline}, in theory, [even **small
amounts**]{.underline} [of a dangerous biological agent could cause
**significant mortality** if prepared and disseminated
effectively16]{.underline}. For instance, the WHO estimates that [50kg
of B. anthracis]{.underline} [distributed upwind of a population of 500
000 would leave 95 000 people dead and 125 000 more
incapacitated17]{.underline}. Other sources suggest that 100kg of B.
anthracis, disseminated via a crop-sprayer, could kill as many as
**[three million people]{.underline}**, and comparable values have been
projected for other agents2,18. Another concern is that a contagious
biological agent will result in person-to-person transmission, creating
a self-sustaining effect not present in any other weapons class10.

While [mass casualties are **possible**]{.underline}, it is also
important to note that, [even in situations with **few
casualties**]{.underline}, [biological weapons attacks may have profound
**social** and **economic ramifications3**]{.underline}. [Such attacks
could lead to **widespread**]{.underline} social **[panic]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[disorder]{.underline}**, [resulting in
**self-destructive behaviour** and creating what is called a "**societal
autoimmune effect**" involving increases in crime and looting19. While
there is little evidence to predict this would]{.underline} occur based
on previous disaster situations (such as the terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001, where the public reaction is
described as effective and adaptive, rather than panicked and
disruptive), it must remain a consideration20. The effects of a
largescale attack involving biological weapons are unknown, and
epidemics of highly fatal diseases may cause serious social
disruption20.

[The]{.underline} **[economic consequences]{.underline}** of biological
weapons attacks [are **severe**]{.underline} [and suggest that investing
in defense makes **good** economic **sense**]{.underline}. While there
were only five deaths in the 2001 anthrax attacks, those attacks
resulted in tens of billions of dollars in government spending21. Also,
the financial sector may be negatively impacted if investor confidence
plummets3. Similarly, an attack on the agricultural sector, which
accounts for 15% of the United States GDP, could have severe economic
ramifications3. If the biological agent being used is contagious, there
could also be implications for trade and travel restrictions3. The SARS
epidemic of 2003 showed the economic consequences of a highly infectious
disease, essentially "crippling" some of the most dynamic cities in the
world4. The Center for Biosecurity has estimated the economic cost of a
biological weapons attack in the U.S. could exceed one trillion USD15.
In short, there are social and economic consequences that, considered in
conjunction with the potential for catastrophically high mortality,
justify the framing of biological weapons as a significant existential
threat to the United States. This is illustrated by considering the
specific case of smallpox.

[The Variola virus]{.underline}, which causes smallpox, [is an example
of an agent that, if weaponized and used in an attack, would pose a
serious **existential threat**]{.underline} [to the United]{.underline}
States22. It [is highly **contagious**]{.underline}; [in a]{.underline}
1972 [outbreak in Yugoslavia]{.underline}, even with routine
vaccinations, [which are no longer carried out, the **disease
spread**]{.underline} rapidly[, with each affected individual infecting
11 to 13 others23. It is also lethal, with a **30% fatality
rate1**]{.underline}. [Human populations are highly susceptible because,
since **eradication**, **vaccinations**]{.underline} [have not been
given for **20 years24**]{.underline}. [Other features make smallpox an
appealing option for **bioterrorism**]{.underline}: it has no treatment
once symptoms occur; it would not be detected for 7-17 days; it is
physically disfiguring; and the virus is stable in aerosol form1,24.
Perhaps the most problematic aspect of smallpox is that those infected
are contagious before symptoms appear. Simulations have been carried
out, including a 1999 exercise by the Center for Civilian Biodefense
Studies at Johns Hopkins University, where a terrorist release of
Variola virus grew into a global outbreak, which the health and
emergency response system was unable to control22. Here it could be
suggested that prevention efforts promoted by securitization are the
only option, given the apparent inability to contain a global outbreak
after an attack has occurred. While the dangers posed by the Variola
virus are not contested, skeptics argue that it is too difficult to
acquire to be a real danger10. However, there is significant concern
over unaccounted Soviet Union smallpox samples, and a 1999 U.S. report
pointed to evidence that secret stockpiles of the virus are held by
North Korea, Russia, and Iraq1,25. It has also been suggested that the
terrorist organization Aum Shinrikyo holds quantities of the Variola
virus22.

**[Threat]{.underline}** [and risk assessments should not rely solely on
the **worst-case scenarios**]{.underline} of biological weapons attacks,
[especially since practical challenges still limit terrorists' ability
to conduct attacks that will have the greatest possible effect. However,
it is **equally crucial**]{.underline} [to be aware of the wide
**range** of **consequences**]{.underline} [of such an
**attack**]{.underline}. [This section has argued that there could be
**serious ramifications** on several dimensions]{.underline},
[ramifications which **justify** the **framing** of]{.underline}
**[biological weapons]{.underline}** [as an **existential threat**
to]{.underline} the United States and warrant investment in an
appropriate response capacity. Securitization, therefore, played an
important role encouraging policy responses that were justified and
appropriate.

**The threat is real and securitization is [necessary]{.underline}.**

4\. Preparedness for an Attack

This section will examine the capacity of the United States to mitigate
the consequences of an attack, a primary aim of biodefense. For
government action to be justified[, the response must be
**appropriate**]{.underline} [to the given **threat
level**]{.underline}. The argument will be that this is the case with
biodefense programs, which must seek to address key weaknesses in the
preparedness system.

There is a general consensus that [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has insufficient
**capabilities**]{.underline} [to respond **effectively**]{.underline}
[to a **biological** weapons]{.underline} **[attack3]{.underline}**.
Three primary components of preparedness will be addressed: the ability
to detect an attack, the preparedness of the health care and emergency
response system to respond, and the medical countermeasures that
currently exist. It will be shown that there are important deficiencies
in all three of these areas, further suggesting that programs aimed at
developing a more appropriate response capacity are not overestimating
the threat but are both justified and necessary.

Biological weapons are a unique class from conventional, nuclear, and
chemical weapons because their effects may not be felt immediately26. It
could take days before it becomes apparent that an attack has taken
place; this is problematic as immediate treatment may be crucial to
survival27. Oral antibiotics for inhalational anthrax, for example,
should be administered within 48 hours of exposure, which leaves little
time for detection and delivery1. Any delay in detection could result in
a large number of casualties.

Additionally, if the weapon agent is contagious, failure to detect and
respond the attack may result in a greater spread of the infection. For
this reason, adequate detection capabilities are essential to
bioterrorism preparedness.

Unfortunately, [while funding for biodefense has led to
**improvements**]{.underline}, such as biosurveillance systems that seek
information on disease outbreaks, [there are still
**weaknesses**]{.underline} in the system15. [The systems are still
quite **rudimentary**]{.underline}, relying on a time-consuming process
of clinician reporting, laboratory diagnostics, and the phoning,
mailing, or faxing of reports15. To improve, biosurveillance must be
modernized. We need more effective electronic reporting, quick, cheap,
and reliable diagnostic tests, and the integration of public health
surveillance data with that from other sectors such as law and
intelligence agencies26. Currently, however, detection systems are not
able to detect biological agents at relatively low concentrations, or to
detect multiple biological agents with a single system, and they are not
sufficiently portable and user-friendly26. Detection ability is further
compromised by poor diagnostic capabilities in hospitals. One U.S. study
found that 91.2% of U.S. hospitals surveyed lacked the necessary
diagnostic technology to analyze and identify biological agents28.

Hospitals have been targeted as the weakest link in the preparedness
chain, in particular due to their inability to accommodate a sudden
influx of mass casualties29. It has been found that 60% of hospitals
lack such resources as the supplies, equipment, beds, and staff to
respond to a mass casualty situation28. Consequently, hospitals lack the
surge capacity to attend to patients; this could be disastrous in terms
of victims not receiving life-saving treatment, the failure to
quarantine infectious individuals, and the possibility of social
disorder as a result of public frustration. The problem is that
hospitals need far greater resources to respond to a bioterrorist attack
than they do for everyday functioning30. Practice scenarios have
demonstrated this resource shortage problem on more than one occasion. A
simulated attack on a U.S. city that involved the pneumonic plague
resulted in antibiotic shortages after just three days; the situation
worsened until, at the end of the weeklong simulation, 3700 cases of
plague had been identified and 2000 "deaths" had been reported31.

Also of concern is the overall inadequacy of medical countermeasures for
biological weapons, identified as one of the areas in greatest need of
attention15. Of the twelve biological agents identified as posing the
highest threat to the United States, only anthrax, smallpox, and
botulism receive substantial funding for medical countermeasure
development and acquisition15. One reason for this is that
pharmaceutical companies are not as motivated to fund research and
development addressing biological weapons since there is not as great a
commercial market as there is for chronic diseases and influenza15. Even
such practices as decontamination require funding and improvement. The
decontamination procedures for B. anthracis, previously used in the 2001
anthrax attacks, while effective, were also slow and expensive, and
could not be replicated in a situation with mass casualties15.

In the discussion above, it was argued that **[high government
funding]{.underline}** [is not **overestimated**]{.underline} [but is
**appropriate**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[justified]{.underline}** [to implement biodefense initiatives
required to **improve** response **capacity**]{.underline}. [This was
done by demonstrating that the United States is **ill-equipped** to deal
with a **significant** biological weapons **attack**, and that this
**lack** of **preparedness** risks further **exacerbating** the already
potentially **catastrophic consequences**]{.underline} of a biological
weapons attack. Securitization was useful in helping justify
prioritizing funding to address this issue.

5\. Probability of an Attack

The potentially disastrous consequences of an attack and the lack of
preparedness for such an event have been demonstrated, but perhaps [none
of that would matter]{.underline} (or justify prioritizing biodefense)
[if the probability of an **attack** by states]{.underline} or
terrorists **[was negligible]{.underline}**, due to an absence of
capacity or will to carry out a biological weapons attack on the United
States. This section will consider the likelihood of a biological
weapons attack in the United States by states or terrorist groups. This
issue is hotly contested, with some groups arguing that the chances of
an attack are much lower than popular fears and perceptions would
suggest, while others, like CIA Director Gross, believe it is "only a
matter of time", and predict another biological weapons attack on the
United States before 202028,32. As noted earlier, this essay's focus is
not on whether media rhetoric is inflated or public perceptions
unrealistic. Rather, it will be argued that the increasing availability
of biological weapons and the documented intent of various hostile
groups to acquire such weapons make an attack more likely. This is where
we see the relevance of the precautionary principle, as an uncertainty
surrounding the probability of an attack encourages us to adopt the
principle, promoting caution where funding is allocated in light of the
dire consequences that may arise were an attack to occur.

Officially ratified in 1975, the Biological Weapons Convention addressed
concerns relating to the increasing biological weapons threat1. While
commendable, the convention had important flaws including an absence of
any formal verification of compliance by states. For instance, after
signing the declaration, the Soviet Union continued to develop their
biological weapons program (unbeknownst to the global community)33.
Soviet defectors later confirmed the scale of their program, describing
a massive, covert operation34. Other countries have also been alleged to
have biological weapons programs, including Iraq, North Korea, Iran,
Libya, and Syria33,35. While Iraq has since claimed that its biological
weapons were all destroyed, this has been impossible to verify2.
Additionally, with the recent emergence of biotechnology industries in
low and middle-income countries, most notably Brazil and India, more
states are gaining advanced scientific capacity that could potentially
be applied to biological weapons development and production3. The key
here is that many states now have the scientific and technological
capacity to develop biological weapons, but there is a limited capacity
for national states or international organizations to monitor such a
process36.

In the BWC definition of biological weapons, the primary focus is on
intent---both in terms of the purpose of the microbial agent and the
delivery system1. Intent is the determining factor in the classification
of biological weapons, but this is extremely difficult to measure or
prove until after an act has been committed. In the biological sciences,
much research is readily applicable to justifiable ends (vaccines), as
well as hostile ones (biological weapons). The United States will often
accuse other states of hostile intent based solely on the presence of
pharmaceutical and biotechnological expertise necessary for biological
weapons development35. This can be viewed as an area of overreaction to
the bioweapons threat, illustrating how securitization processes seem to
legitimize some bad policy responses as well as good ones. Despite the
fact that most states could use this expertise to develop biological
weapons, the majority does not. This suggests that, while capacity is
present, the intent to use biological weapons is limited. In fact, over
the past century, there is only one confirmed case of a biological
weapons attack by one state on another: Japan's striking against China
in the 1930s and 1940s1. It has been suggested that reasons for this may
stem from fear of retaliation or the difficulties of controlling effects
on civilians and combatants1. Most countries possessing biological
weapons claim their purpose is to deter attacks or biological weapons
use by others35.

In [the past, the prospect]{.underline} of terrorists using biological
weapons [received **little attention3**]{.underline}. It [was generally
believed that terrorists would not be able to **engineer** biological
**weapons** because]{.underline} [they lacked access to the
**necessary** biological]{.underline} **[agents]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} technological **[capabilities]{.underline}**, [and the
specialized knowledge to weaponize and **disseminate** a biological
**weapon10**]{.underline}. Skeptics still believe that the advanced
genetic capabilities required to produce biological weapons will not be
available to terrorists in the near future3. For instance, the ability
to process a biological agent into aerosol form, the most effective
delivery method, requires expertise across a wide range of scientific
disciplines32. Also suspect is their ability to account for
environmental and meteorological conditions that may disrupt weapon
dissemination10, 32.

However[, a changing **global** and **scientific
landscape**]{.underline} [has led to a greater **potential**
for]{.underline} the **[acquisition]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[biological weapons]{.underline}** [capacity by terrorist groups. For
instance, during the Cold War, the Soviets reportedly employed
approximately **55, 000 scientists** and technicians at 6 **biological
weapons research labs**]{.underline} and 5 production facilities37.
[Among other things, smallpox was **weaponized** into ballistic
**missiles** and bombs38]{.underline}. In 1997, the United States
conducted a visit to one of these research labs to find that the
facility was half empty, poorly guarded, and that most of the scientists
had left39. It is, therefore, possible that the biological agents, the
equipment, and the human knowledge and expertise have since fallen into
the hands of rogue states or terrorist organizations. Additionally,
methods [of biological weapons production are now **freely accessible**
via the]{.underline} **[Internet]{.underline}**, [and the technological
requirements are not beyond the means of a determined, **well-funded**
terrorist **organization2**]{.underline}. Moreover, recent scientific
advances may support biological weapons production by enabling the
production of a higher yield of high-quality product36. They may also
support more effective weaponization, by making agents more resistant to
environmental hazards or by making agents targetable against specific
biochemical pathways36. As these capabilities spread across the globe,
there will be a greater potential for terrorists to harness and use
these techniques. While the capabilities of terrorists to engineer
biological weapons may have been overstated in the past, this can no
longer be said to be the case.

It has been argued that two of the preconditions for assessing the
threat of bioterrorism, vulnerability to an attack and terrorist
capability, are in place; the only remaining consideration is intent40.
It is important to determine whether the intent to acquire and use such
weapons is present among terrorist groups. While terrorist groups have
not often used biological weapons, it is unclear whether this is due to
insufficient capabilities or lack of intent1. There are a variety of
reasons why they may not be interested in the use of biological weapons,
including viewing such weapons as illegitimate in military combat, risks
of tactical failure, perceptions of high technical difficulty, and
concerns about the indiscriminate nature of a biological weapons
attack3. That said, various terrorist groups, including Aum Shinrikyo
and al Qaeda, have a documented interest in the acquisition of
biological weapons, and with advances in biotechnology and
weaponization, their use may become more attractive2, 41.

Experts also point to a shift in terrorist intent:
"**[post-modern]{.underline}**" [terrorism aims to inflict the highest
mortality rather than make **political statements** through
**violence33**. This makes **biological weapons** an **attractive
option** for such groups; one estimate suggests that the cost to cause
**civilian casualties**]{.underline} [is only one dollar per square
kilometer for **biological weapons**]{.underline}, compared to 800 and
2000 dollars per square kilometer for nuclear and conventional weapons,
respectively42. In a similar vein, the recent "war on terror" has
created an increasingly decentralized terrorist threat; biological
weapons are particularly well-suited to this form of smaller, more
informed terrorist groups28. In short, while the intent to use
biological weapons has been documented in terrorist groups in the past,
present circumstances may make the acquisition and use of biological
weapons more attractive.

To conclude, it is difficult to either predict or prevent a bioterrorism
attack, which makes any assessment of attack probability, by necessity,
subject to a high degree of estimation. However, due to the potential
severity of consequences of an attack, the precautionary principle
justifies the government decision to allocate spending according to the
severity of consequences, recognizing a situation where it is better to
overestimate than to underestimate the probability of an attack. As
argued by Michael Moodie of the Chemical and Biological Arms Control
Institute, "The odds (of bioterrorism) are increasing...we have to walk
a fine line between hyping the risk...and trying to convince people that
it is a possibility for which we need to invest resources"2.

6\. Biodefense Funding

The essay's previous sections have argued that a biological weapons
attack would pose an existential threat to the United States, that there
is an inadequate capacity to respond to such an event, and that the
possibility exists for such an attack to occur. This would suggest that
a substantial amount of government funding should be allocated towards
addressing this threat. The decision to securitize bioweapons
facilitated this process. Critics who believe the threat has been
overstated often argue that the government should not invest so heavily
in biodefense, but instead, improve other sectors, such as reducing
mortality from endemic disease11. Meanwhile, proponents may argue that a
securitized issue should receive more funding than issues that are not
framed as an existential threat4. This section will argue that the
response, in terms of government spending, is justified in that it seeks
to protect the public and has not exaggerated the threat of
bioterrorism. This will be demonstrated by examining the degree of
investment in biodefense, showing that a relatively small amount is
allocated specifically to biodefense.

In 2000, the United States federal budget proposed that 10 billion USD
be allocated to counterterrorism programs, an increase of 3.3 billion
dollars from the previous year10. This covered all forms of terrorism,
but there was a greater focus on biological terrorism than in the past,
with spending on medical countermeasures and defense measures increasing
fourfold from 91 million USD in 1998 to 336.6 million in 20002. These
trends intensified after the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent
"Amerithrax" scare. While estimates vary, the consensus is that, since
2001, the United States government has invested between 50 and 100
billion USD towards research and development in response to the
perceived threat of a biological weapons attack43.

One calculation posited that the U.S. allocated 54.39 billion USD to
civilian biodefense programs between 2001 and 201044. This did not
include allocations to Bioshield, a program designed to address the lack
of adequate medical countermeasures for terrorist attacks; 8.7 billion
USD has been allocated since 200445. However, of civilian biodefense
funding, 42.57 of the 54.39 billion USD was directed towards programs
with multiple goals beyond biodefense improvement, such as basic
infectious disease research, programs to improve public health planning
and operations, and improving preparedness for a range of disasters44.
One example is the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
Hospital Preparedness Program, which seeks to improve surge capacity in
healthcare facilities44. Some estimates suggest that up to 92% of
biodefense funding has been directed to programs that serve secondary
purposes, such as improving preparedness for disease pandemics and
natural disasters15.

One could argue that the amounts dedicated to biodefense as a percentage
of entire budgets are not very substantial given the existential threat
posed by an attack. The DHHS, the largest recipient of federal
biodefense funding, has a budget of 879 billion USD, of which biodefense
made up only 0.5%44. Similarly, biodefense makes up less than 1% of the
Department of Homeland Security budget, and only 0.10% of the Department
of Defense Budget44. Accordingly, it could be argued that the bioweapons
threat does not, in fact, take as high a priority in terms of government
funding as one might expect, given the associated security risk.
Additionally, almost all of the increases in investments have arisen
from new funding; other sectors are not suffering at the expense of
biodefense prioritization12.

High funding is appropriate independent of any controversy relating to
estimates of attack probability, as the precautionary principle would
suggest that decisive action is warranted given the potential for dire
consequences, even with a low probability of the event occurring. These
figures show that the funding response is not an overreaction but has
been justified and appropriate given the documented threat of biological
weapons, targeting programs that are likely to protect the public.

7\. Conclusion

The anthrax attacks of 2001 are a case where biological weapons were
used against the United States in the absence of any direct provocation.
Since then, though the issue is controversial, biological weapons have
been considered an important threat to U.S. security. [This
essay]{.underline} has [defended the **securitization**]{.underline} [of
the **biological weapons threat** as a means to an end]{.underline}. It
[is a process to engage in where it is necessary to get **approval** for
**policies**]{.underline} [that are]{.underline}, in themselves,
**[necessary]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[justified]{.underline}**. [By analyzing the **existential threat**
posed by **bioweapons**, the lack of **preparedness** by the United
States for such an event, and the possibility of an attack, evidence
presented in this essay suggests that **these policies** and the overall
government response **were appropriate**]{.underline}. Taking these
issues into account, the essay concluded that the threat of bioterrorism
has not been overestimated; it warrants securitization and the resulting
response measures. Moving forward now, government must recognize and
respond to the reality of an increasing bioterrorism threat.

Although often perceived as a recent invention, **[biological weapons
have been used for hundreds of years.]{.underline}** During the siege of
Kaffa (now Feodossia, Ukraine) in 1346, [the Tatars catapulted the dead
bodies of plague victims into the city, causing an epidemic among the
inhabitants.]{.underline} [The subsequent migration of refugees from the

pandemic.]{.underline}3 In the 18th century, [Sir Jeffrey Amhurst
deliberately caused a smallpox epidemic among hostile Native American
tribes by giving them contaminated hospital blankets.]{.underline} [The
effect on the Indian population was devastating.4]{.underline}

**[Recent use of biological agents to cause deliberate harm has only
rarely been described in the medical literature, with approximately one
report per decade.]{.underline}** [During the 1960s, several outbreaks
of typhoid and dysentery in Japanese hospitals were caused by
intentional food poisoning by a bacteriologist]{.underline}.5 [In 1970,

Although these amateurish attempts seem relatively minor, **[many

**[a small aeroplane carrying 100 kg of anthrax spores could use a

estimated that [if an aeroplane released 50 kg of anthrax over a 2 km

killed and 125 000 incapacitated.]{.underline}10 Other agents could also
cause significant morbidity and mortality (Table 1). **[The bioterrorist
was prominent among an increasingly alarmist cast of menacing characters

the use of anthrax was excluded.1]{.underline}

**[Smallpox is potentially the most dangerous bioterrorist weapon
because of its infectivity in aerosol form, case fatality of 30% and
high patient‐to‐patient transmission rate]{.underline}**. [The world\'s
population has become increasingly susceptible to smallpox because of
the discontinuation of vaccination, and probably **only 20% of the
population are now protected.**]{.underline}15 [Clinical features
include malaise, fever, rigors, vomiting, headache, backache, delirium
and an erythematous rash]{.underline}. Over the following week, [the
patient develops mucous membrane lesions, which shed virus particles,
and a rash which progresses from macules to papules to pustular
vesicles.]{.underline} In contrast to varicella, the skin lesions are
all present at the same stage of development. Patients are regarded as
infectious until all of the scabs separate.22 [**Many exposed patients
may shed virus from the oropharynx without developing the disease and
cause further virus transmission.**23]{.underline}

**[A high degree of awareness is required to diagnose smallpox, because
it can easily be confused with varicella, erythema multiforme or
allergic dermatitis.]{.underline}** Pharyngeal swabs and skin scrapings
are required for virus isolation, ELISA and PCR. [Samples from any

[During the Gulf War, **the US stockpiled 30 million doses of
ciprofloxacin in the zone of operations to protect troops in case of an
anthrax attack**.**4 Iraq produced enormous quantities of anthrax**, and
it is possible that **some of this is now in the possession of terrorist
groups.**]{.underline} Aerosolized anthrax spores would cause the
inhalational form of disease (traditionally known as woolsorters\'

anthrax is usually fatal despite antibiotic treatment.]{.underline}**

Diagnosis is made by blood culture and ELISA. The patient does not

**[SARS first appeared in Guangdong province in southern China in
November 2002, then spread to 28 countries, infecting 8096 people and
resulting in 774 deaths]{.underline}**, according to data from the World
Health Organization (WHO). This case study raises interesting questions
about securitizing actors. [Although SARS originated in China and
disproportionately afflicted Chinese citizens (5327 infected and 349
dead), **Chinese authorities were not the first to securitize the
disease; rather this role fell to WHO and a retired Chinese military
doctor** who posted his concerns on the web.]{.underline} In fact
Chinese leaders initially sought to desecuritize SARS. Despite the
tendency of the Copenhagen School to treat desecuritization as a
desirable outcome, indicating the end of extreme measures and their
resulting negative impacts on social freedoms**[, in the case of SARS,
desecuritization actually led to further restrictions on freedom of
expression.]{.underline}** [The first incidence of SARS (initially
called atypical pneumonia) was reported in Guangdong province in
mid-November 2002, but Chinese provincial officials withheld information
about the disease from the general public for another 3
months]{.underline}. On 11 February 2003, the Guangdong government
finally made a statement about the disease, the same day that the
official Communist Party newspaper, People\'s Daily, announced on its
website that the province had succeeded in controlling the outbreak,
though five deaths were reported (Congressional- Executive Commission on
China 2003: 2; Huang 2003: 10). **[SARS then spread to Hong Kong later
in February 2003, after a visiting doctor from Guangdong developed
symptoms, and then continued to spread globally]{.underline}**. Although
the territory would go on to play a key role in publicizing and
countering the disease, the story of SARS in Hong Kong is not included
in this case study, as the securitization dynamics played out quite
differently there than on the mainland, due to the more open social and
political environment in the Special Administrative Region (on SARS in
Hong Kong, see Loh 2004; Abraham 2005). [The timing of the new disease
was especially unfortunate for the Chinese leadership; coinciding with a
period of leadership change, spanning from the 16th Communist Party
Congress in November 2002 to the National People\'s Congress in March
2003]{.underline}. The Chinese Ministry of Health reportedly sent a team
to Guangdong to investigate in late January, but the results were
classified \'top secret\' and no nation-wide health advisory was issued
until 3 April (Huang 2003: 9-10). [The Chinese government also refused
to cooperate with WHO until April 2003. **Desecuritization in this
instance turned out to be far from optimal, resulting in the spread of
the disease throughout China and globally, as well as in the restriction
of information on public health inside and outside the
country**]{.underline}. Securitization The Copenhagen School assumes
that securitizing actors are collectivities, or at least their
designated representatives who enjoy a position of authority. Because a
successful securitization involves convincing an audience of the urgency
of a particular threat, most Copenhagen School scholars tend to discount
the likelihood of individuals accomplishing a securitizing move (Buzan
1997: 19; Buzan et al. 1997: 33, 40-41; Huysmans 1998: 493; Hansen 2000:
289), though others emphasize that what really matters is the speaker\'s
social capital (Vuori 2008: 77), positional power (Stritzel 2007: 364)
or relationship to the audience (Balzacq 2005: 272). [The SARS case
raises new questions about securitizing actors and the role of the
audience. Although in the case of SARS the initial securitizing move
came from an international organization - the WHO, which issued a global

Given the spectre of exceptionalism that comes with security, research
in the tradition of the Copenhagen School has focused mostly on averting
securitizations that facilitate emergency measures (see Roe, 2008;
Wæver, 2000: 253--254). [It has been claimed that a securitizing move
that shifts an issue from normal politics into the realm of the
exception needs to be countered by an explicit desecuritizing move that
shifts the issue back to the normal by discursively undermining the
threat construction]{.underline} (Hansen, 2012: 542--545; Huysmans,
1995: 65--67; 1998; Roe, 2004: 285--287).8 [Such a conception of
securitization and desecuritization presents several ways back to normal
politics.]{.underline} [However, it also reproduces the categorical
belief that there are only two possible political forms: 'non-security'
(associated with normal politics) and 'security' (associated with the
logic of war)]{.underline} (see Figure 1). This perspective is
conceptually constraining because [non-security is not always an option:
on one hand, **desecuritizing moves may simply not be successful because
desecuritizers lack discursive authority or because their discursive
strategies do not resonate with the relevant audiences**]{.underline}
(see Buzan et al., 1998: 26). On the other hand, [non-security may be
undesirable owing to the negative side-effects that desecuritization can
produce]{.underline} -- for example, by undermining legitimate claims to
protect vulnerable groups (Roe, 2004). [Without an alternative to
desecuritization, this would mean letting the logic of war
unfold.]{.underline}

The alternative we propose here is based on the assumption that there is
little reason to accept that speaking about security concerns
necessarily leads to the use of full emergency measures. Paul Roe (2004:
292--293) has argued convincingly that securitized issues can be
managed. While the language of security remains present, its effects can
be mitigated (see also Tjalve, 2011). As the debate on the state of
exception among legal theorists shows[**, there are different ways of
constitutionally dealing with emergencies that foresee particularly the
taming of sovereign power through constitutional
containmen**t]{.underline} (see Dyzenhaus, 2006; Ferejohn and Pasquino,
2004; Gross, 2003; Scheuermann, 2006). For example, what has been termed
the 'accommodation model' of exceptionalism is based on the
understanding that it would be unrealistic to think that the existing
constitutional order could remain completely untouched during times of
crisis. [Nevertheless, the basic pillars of the constitution need to be
protected and the legal order should therefore have mechanisms ready to
keep an emergency within these constitutional confines]{.underline}
(Ackermann, 2004; Gross, 2003: 1043--1044; Tushnet, 2005). Thus, from a
legal theory perspective, [one important alternative and complement to
desecuritization is constitutional accommodation]{.underline} (see
Figure 1). [It is an alternative in sofar as it mitigates the effects of
securitizations that cannot be avoided. However, it is also
complementary to discursive desecuritization because it counteracts the
tendencies of the emergency trap outlined earlier]{.underline} -- in
other words, it removes or mitigates a precondition for further
securitizations (see also White, 2013: 14--15 for the inverse approach).

[Such confines can be both ex ante and ex post constitutional checks on
discretionary powers]{.underline}. Ex ante, **[both the initiation and
the scope of emergency measures can be constrained.]{.underline}**
Regarding the initiation of emergency rule[, **Schmittian decisionism**
-- according to which the sovereign themself determines the exception --
**can be countered by functionally separating the decision on the
presence or absence of an emergency and the decision on the means to
overcome it**]{.underline}. This is seen as a fundamental precondition
for keeping emergency rule 'constitutional' (Rossiter, 1948: 299--300).
[At the IO level, this could mean that a member-state body or other
subcommittee is entitled to formally invoke the state of exception and
that only then can an IO organ decide on emergency
measures]{.underline}. [The range of available emergency measures can be
circumscribed so that the sovereign's discretion does not trespass on
elementary rules and rights even in the state of emergency.]{.underline}

**[In addition, IO emergency powers can be contained ex post with the
help of accountability mechanisms.]{.underline}** As scholars in the
literature on emerging global administrative law argue, **[basic
principles of domestic administrative law]{.underline}** -- and thereby
mechanisms of political and judicial review -- **[can and should be
instituted within the international legal system to increase IO
accountability]{.underline}** (see Kingsbury et al., 2005).[9
Accountability can take the form of political review, whereby an
interstate assembly or executive board watches over IO emergency
powers]{.underline}. [Legal review, in turn, can be achieved by either a
legal counsel or an internal review panel to assess the lawfulness of
the actions of IOs]{.underline}. In addition[, inter-institutional
processes of steering and control can contribute to the review of an
IO's deployment of emergency competencie]{.underline}s (Kingsbury and
Casini, 2009: 337). [**An important side-effect of accountability
mechanisms is that they enhance the transparency and public scrutiny of
IO activities**.]{.underline} [This may also prove to be positive
feedback for desecuritization efforts by opening the possibility of
discursively contesting the securitizing moves of IOs.]{.underline}

and the Military Role in Combating Influenza", Armed Forces & Society

[The]{.underline} **[De-escalation]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[Military Efforts]{.underline}** in Combating Flu

From the earlier discussion, it is clear there is an established
pedigree of military interest and involvement in combating influenza
driven primarily by concerns regarding the disease's impact on troop
readiness and the perception that pandemic influenza was contemporaneous
with conflict. [The post--World War II era]{.underline}, however,
[witnessed a progressive reduction in **militaries' role**]{.underline}
[in combating the **disease**,]{.underline} [manifest in the
**decommissioning**]{.underline} [of military-led **influenza
programs**]{.underline} [and a reduced role in policy.]{.underline} We
contend that there were three main axes that underlay this effective
deescalation of military influenza efforts.

[The first of these was the rise of the **international
institutions**]{.underline} [of public health in the postwar period
leading to the mandate of **combating pandemic**]{.underline} [influenza
shift from a military to **civilian focus**]{.underline}. [Primary among
these was the creation of the World Health Organization]{.underline}
(**[WHO]{.underline}**) [that was established in 1948 as the United
Nations']{.underline} specialized [agency for public
**health**]{.underline}, and which took an active role in coordinating
the international response to influenza. In 1952, the WHO established
the global influenza surveillance network (GISN) that was charged
primarily with identifying strains of influenza in common circulation,
thus allowing the WHO to provide technical support to member states in
managing influenza outbreaks. [This network **replaced**
what]{.underline} was in some states [the]{.underline} traditional
mandate of the **[military establishment]{.underline}**, such as the
Walter Reed influenza surveillance system, which until the late 1950s
played a key role in pandemic detection and policy in the United States
(and Downloaded from afs.sagepub.com at TUFTS UNIV on December 8, 2015
was also responsible for rapidly isolating the 1957 Asian flu strain and
issuing initial warnings of a pandemic).83 When the ''Asian flu''
pandemic emerged in 1957, the GISN played a leading role in managing the
global response, utilizing its international networks to collate and
analyze statistical data to identify trends and effective public health
measures.84 In 1959, under an edict from the expert committee on
respiratory viruses, the WHO encouraged outposts of the GISN into closer
engagement with national public health authorities of their host member
states, officially recommending:

> that the laboratory network originally organized under the programme
> should be brought into closer relationship with national public health
> authorities. This is necessary for two reasons---first, in order that
> the influenza centre of the country may be alerted to, and may
> organize the investigation of, outbreaks in distant parts of the
> country, of which it might otherwise not learn in time, and secondly
> so that the centre may keep the health authorities informed of the
> appearance of unusual viruses or epidemics elsewhere in the world and
> of the appropriate technical measures which should be taken.85

[This move encouraged member states' **ministries of
health**]{.underline}, [rather than **militaries**]{.underline}, [to
take greater carriage of **national influenza programs**]{.underline}
[through their partnership with the WHO]{.underline}.

[For the United States, the embedding of influenza research in the
**civilian sector**]{.underline} was [also driven by the implementation
of the **Vannevar Bush plan**, a conspectus that outlays the American
postwar agenda for scientific **research**]{.underline}. [In it, Bush
proposed limiting military-based research to that involving the
''improvement of **existing weapons''**]{.underline} [only]{.underline},
[officially recommending that]{.underline}:

> Some research on military problems should be conducted, in time of
> peace as well as in war, by civilians independently of the military
> establishment. It is the primary responsibility of the Army and Navy
> to train the men, make available the weapons, and employ the strategy
> that will bring victory in combat. The Armed Services cannot be
> expected to be experts in all of the complicated fields which make it
> possible for a great nation to fight successfully in total war\... the
> job of long-range research involving application of the newest
> scientific discoveries to military needs should be the responsibility
> of those civilian scientists in the universities and in industry who
> are best trained to discharge it thoroughly and successfully.86

[The second factor contributing to the de-escalation of military
influenza work was the **absence** of a **second catastrophic
pandemic**]{.underline} [that effectively undermined perceptions of the
**strategic threat** of the malady compared with the antecedent
**Spanish flu**. The]{.underline} **[normalization]{.underline}** [of
influenza **vaccines**]{.underline} at [the close of World War II found
fast utility in responding to **emergent pandemics**]{.underline}.
[Armed with new vaccine technology, nations such as the United States
and Britain responded to the 1957 Asian Flu pandemic with large-scale
programs to **vaccinate** their **citizens**]{.underline}.87 For the
United States, the efficacious use of vaccines coupled with the low
morbidity of the influenza strain meant that the impact on national
interests was only marginal.88 Henderson et al. noted little discernible
impact on industry or on the economy at large.89 Fred Davenport, then
director of the AFEB Commission on Influenza, also observed during the
peak pandemic period that, ''there had been no disruption of essential
activities in either civilian or military communities.''90 In a 1959
report from the WHO, it was subsequently noted that ''experience in many
countries has now established vaccination as the most efficient method
for the prevention of influenza,'' offering governments a powerful tool
for combating the disease.91 This experience was then replicated in the
1968 Hong Kong flu outbreak where medical interventions and an influenza
strain of low morbidity resulted in a pandemic of relatively low
severity.92 The optimism that accompanied the perceived diminishing
threat of pandemic influenza was reflected in a statement by US Surgeon
General in 1970 that that ''the war against pestilence \[is\] won.''93
It was also manifest in a decision by the US Army in 1971 to abolish the
AFEB Commission on Influenza, in part because ''the growing
effectiveness of the prevention of disease \[has\] materially lessened
the requirement for AFEB assistance in both field investigations and the
organization of contract research.''94

A second approach focuses on why cyber norms emerge only slowly,
building on the existing IR norms literature (Finnemore & Hollis, 2016).
Early works in this area focused on the debate among states, especially
at the United Nations, followed by a growing number of proposal from the
private and the civil sector (Hurwitz, 2014). However, cyber norms
remain contested at the international level (Grisby, 2017). More
recently, the interest of researchers shifted to the role of the
creators (mostly private entities) and exploiters (sub-, semi-, and
non-state actors) of digital technologies in shaping the behavioral
standards that new regulation needs to take into account (Hurel &
Lobato, 2018). **[States]{.underline}** [need to know how their
**intelligence services**]{.underline} [work in cyberspace, because
through their **tools** and **practices**]{.underline} [they set
practical norms of acceptable (**cyber) espionage**]{.underline} with
[far-reaching effects on **state behavior** in]{.underline}
**[cyberspace]{.underline}** (Georgieva, 2019). [The focus on the role
of **intelligence** agencies in cyber conflict]{.underline}--as [both
the biggest threat and the most **capable provider** of]{.underline}
**[safety]{.underline}**--[opens up interesting questions linked to the
**larger transformation**]{.underline} [of these agencies in the context
of the **digitization of society**]{.underline}. [Some authors argue
that cyber conflict is primarily an **intelligence game**]{.underline},
because setting up cyber exploitation is much more expensive than
countering released exploitation, which increases the incentive to keep
the target at risk (Lindsay, 2017).

A third approach explores the broader repercussion of cyber conflict
dynamics for government and governance. The concept of networked
governance seems especially apt at capturing the essence of cyberspace
as co-constituted by technical devices and networks and socio-political
institutions (Hofmann, 2016). The key governance challenge in cyberspace
is fragmentation of authority and accountability. A case in point is the
lack in public transparency and trusted knowledge about the perpetrators
behind most cyber incidents. Although the number of public attributions
of cyber incidents by states and threat intelligence firms has been on
the rise, both types of actors have political and economic reasons not
to fully disclose their evidence (Egloff, 2019). As a consequence,
attribution claims remain contested in the public domain, undermining
the legitimacy of state action--from insurance matters and criminal
proceedings to mechanism of international cooperation and potentially
escalation control.

Cluster 3: Securitization, practice, and assemblages

Looking back at the beginnings of the cyber threat story, the policy
debate was riddled with cyber-doom scenarios and constant attempts to
mobilize in the political process. As a reaction to what was considered
a "hype," some scholars started to get interested in why and how this
issue was presented the way it was and with what consequences. Early
work to analyze the issues surrounding the politics of Internet from IR
and critical security studies perspectives emerged at the end of the
1990s (Deibert, 2002; Eriksson, 2001; Saco, 1999). A bit later, there
was a concentrated effort to apply variations of securitization theory
to the issue of cyber security politics (cf. Dunn Cavelty, 2008; Hansen
& Nissenbaum, 2009; Lawson, 2013). Securitization signifies the
representation of a fact, a person, or a development as a danger for the
military, political, economic, ecological, and/or social security of a
political collective and the acceptance of this representation by the
respective political addressee (Buzan, Waever, & De Wilde, 1998). The
successful securitization of a topic justifies the use of all available
means to counter it--including those outside the normal political rules
of the game.

Following the theory, the prime questions this literature engaged with
were related to the object of security, to what or whom was considered
the main threat, and to what policy responses flowed from these threat
constructions (Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010). Given its theoretical
underpinnings, the Copenhagen School focuses mainly on official
statements by heads of state, high-ranking officials or heads of
international institutions (Hansen, 2006, p. 64). What a focus on elite
speech acts ignores, however, is how these discursive practices are
facilitated or prepared by practices of actors that are not so easily
visible. The social competition for the definition of reality is not
only held in the open political arena. There are always state and
nonstate actors "under the radar"--that is, specialized bureaucratic
units, consultants or other experts--which have the capacity to
establish "the truth" about certain threats, thus pre-structuring the
discursive field in relevant ways (Huysmans, 2006, p. 72).

Cyber security, so the common assumption, arises from the interaction of
technologies, processes, and everyday practices. Thus, the literature
pays particular attention to how a variety of actors uses different
representations of danger to create or change different political,
private, social, and commercial understandings of security in selected
public spheres. In addition, it gives more weight to material aspects of
the issue in the tradition of STS (Balzacq & Dunn Cavelty, 2016;
Collier, 2018; Shires, 2018; Stevens, 2016), looking at the
co-constitution of technology and politics. In particular, it recognizes
that the political reading of cyber security cannot be divorced from
particular knowledge practices in different communities.

As the most recent research focus to emerge, literature in this cluster
covers a variety of topics, united by a focus on understanding how cyber
security emerges as an assemblage of people, objects, and enacted ideas.
Questions of authority and power are most directly addressed by research
in this cluster. C. Stevens (2019) sets out to better understand the
role of cyber security companies by looking at Symantec's analysis of
Stuxnet and the publication of their reports in the public. Tanczer
(2019) focuses on the increasingly blurred boundaries between field of
security professionals and hackers, pointing to changes in the larger
context of security and insecurity that are reflected in the practices
of these technical experts and in the conception of them. Shires (2019)
looks at how the cyber security industry portrays cyberspace as a
terrain of persistent threat, systemic vulnerability, and intelligence
ambiguity, a classic "noir" narrative that results from systemic
economic deficiencies (distorted incentives for protection) and from
systemic political deficiencies (black markets for new exploits). By
focusing on non-traditional actors and aspects of politics, this type of
research is able to make invisible aspects of cyber security visible.

Conclusion: [Where is **cyber security**]{.underline}
[politics]{.underline} research [headed]{.underline}?

[Over the past decade, **research** in **cyber security**]{.underline}
[politics has seen the emergence of a **growing**
interdisciplinary]{.underline} **[body]{.underline}** [of work that is
at the same time **theoretically informed**]{.underline}, [grounded in
**empirical observations**, and **policy-relevant** in many of its
insights. We have ended our **intellectual history** by outlining three
research clusters. In place]{.underline} of a summary of the past and
present evolution of cyber security as a security political issue, we
want to look into a possible future of research on cyber security
politics in this concluding section. We do this based on the same
assumption discussed at the beginning of this article: that the
trajectory of both cyber security research and cyber security policy
will continue to be shaped by the interplay between technology,
politics, and science. The direction in which research and policy will
move will be co-constituted by technological possibilities, political
choices, and scientific practices. We end our intellectual history with
a brief outlook on likely developments in all three areas.

Digital technologies have politics, and technological possibilities and
developments will require new governance mechanisms, while at the same
time being shaped by politics. First, the interconnectedness between
ever more complex socio-technical systems is bound to increase. Cyber
security will grow in importance as a topic as countries all around the
world strive to shape digital transformation processes that affect
society, economy, and the state alike. In the context of what has been
called fourth industrial revolution, the complexity of socio-technical
systems will increase due the ubiquitous digitalization and automation
of technical processes that support a great variety of socio-political
institutions. As these technical system become tighter coupled and
integrate more aspects of society and economy, cyber security concerns
will inevitably expand to more policy fields at both the national and
international level. These developments will create new demands for
technical and organizational research that needs to be better integrated
with approaches from the social and political science.

Second, cyberspace will become increasingly dependent on space-based
technologies and interlinked with newly emerging technologies in the
fields of quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). This will
increase the size of cyberspace. More importantly, as an enabling
technology with diverse applications in all areas of life, AI will link
cyberspace to more policy fields. AI will become an essential element of
cyber security and will have a profound impact on the speed, scale,
duration, autonomy, and complexity of cyber operations, for both offense
and defense. These new technologies will be primarily developed by
global technology firms and the private sector. As a consequence, state
actors will likely become more dependent on technology firms and
independent technology experts, further transforming the relationship
between public and private actors. The fact that there is considerable
**[uncertainty]{.underline}** regarding the tempo and scope of these
technological [developments creates new demands for
**research**]{.underline} [that maps, assesses, models, and]{.underline}
**[forecasts]{.underline}** [new **technological
possibilities**]{.underline}. [As social scientists, we need to
understand the increasingly salient **political** and]{.underline}
social **[aspects]{.underline}** [that will affect the patterns of
**cooperation**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[conflict]{.underline}** in politics and society at the national and
international level.

**[Political choices]{.underline}** [at the **national**]{.underline}
and international **[level]{.underline}** [have a **technological
dimension**. Politics will **influence** and **govern
technology**]{.underline} [development while at the same time being
**pre-structured** by **technology**]{.underline}. [First, we can expect
that **political**]{.underline} and military **[actors]{.underline}**
[will attempt to better understand the (limited) **strategic
utility**]{.underline} [of cyber operations below the level of **armed
conflict**]{.underline}, [in order to find the right balance between
**restraint** and **exploitation**]{.underline}. [One key challenge in
this context is ho**w best** to **manage** the]{.underline}
**[transformation]{.underline}** of [state intelligence services in the
digital age and their **growing dependence**]{.underline} on private
intelligence firms. Another key challenge is linked to information
operations and propaganda that might be spread more targeted and
effectively via AI technologies and social media platforms. These
political developments raise important research questions that require
interdisciplinary answers.

Second, public actors will uphold their efforts to control the risk of
escalation trough international cooperation. [States cannot secure
cyberspace on their own, without taking into account **market** and
**social forces**; yet no]{.underline} **[stable cyber
governance]{.underline}** [framework will emerge without greater
**convergence** on **responsible behavior**]{.underline} [among **great
powers**]{.underline}. [As long as great powers
**disagree**]{.underline} [about what represents responsible use of
**cyber operations** in]{.underline} **[state
interactions]{.underline}**, and [for that matter what forms of
espionage and interference in the political process of other states
through cyberspace are acceptable, **little** top-down
**progress**]{.underline} [will materialize]{.underline}. **[Bottom-up
progress]{.underline}**, [on the other hand, presupposes that the actors
become **more visible**]{.underline} [for each other in order to
**successfully work together**]{.underline} [in a multi-stakeholder
framework]{.underline}. **[Research]{.underline}** [can shed light on
**invisible actors** and **analyze**]{.underline} [the interaction
between market]{.underline} **[dynamics]{.underline}** [and **political
dynamics**]{.underline} in stabilizing cyberspace, it can evaluate if
the socio-technical institutions that secure cyberspace reflect the
tools and practices of public and private actors.

Third, the key governance challenge at the domestic political level is
how to overcome fragmentation of authority and accountability. Tighter
coupling of technical systems and their growing interconnectedness with
socio-political institutions creates growing demand for governance in
networks, which in turn means that governments increasingly share
responsibility with actors from business and society. The integration of
policy into a coherent overall framework involves difficult trade-offs
between security and privacy and creates horizontal and vertical
coordination and cooperation problems across government and at the
intersections between state, economy, and society. Research can evaluate
how states can fine-tune their multidimensional roles. How states decide
to regulate their technology base is moreover directly linked to how
they anticipate this will influence their relative economic, political,
and military power at the international level. Academics in this context
can study how different (democratic and authoritarian) political systems
balance regulation and market forces differently and what this means for
state access to the private technology sector, export control systems of
dual-use technologies, and screening mechanisms of foreign investment
into the strategically relevant technology base.

Scientific practice, as our third and final sphere of interest, will
keep coevolving with the anticipated changes in the spheres of
technology and politics. We started the article with the ascertainment
that there is no "field" or "subfield" of cyber security politics--and
we conclude with a wish that this remains true in the future. [Research
at the **intersection**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
**[cybersecurity]{.underline}** [and **security politics** in order to
remain **relevant**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[policy
choices]{.underline}** [and cognizant of technological possibilities
needs to **speak to** a variety]{.underline} of **[other bodies of
research]{.underline}**, [free to choose interesting and pressing issue
without **disciplinary constraints**; it needs to co-opt some of the
**new data** analytical tools]{.underline} **[offered by
AI]{.underline}**, [and it needs to flexibly overcome some of the
**institutional barriers**]{.underline} [that slowed down its
**independent contribution** to **cyber security**]{.underline}.

A first key challenge for cyber security politics research is conceptual
and linked to the integration of theoretical knowledge from different
disciplines and research traditions. Researchers need to better
integrate concepts and mechanisms from IR and security studies, IPE, and
intelligence studies to analyze the transformation of intelligence
services and how this affects their relationship with private cyber
security and intelligence firms. They need to better understand the
interplay between (black) security markets and (covert) security
political dynamics if they want to explain the co-existence of strategic
restraint and low-level subversion in cyberspace. Cyber security
politics research must pay more attention to economic aspects of the
phenomena at hand. Practice theory with its focus on technological
possibilities and socio-technical processes allows to integrate these
different approaches at the empirical level. STS offers a productive
lens for understanding the mutual interplay between the technical and
the socio-political sphere and, from an analytical point of view, to
deal with the opaqueness of cyber operations. Such an approach is of
critical importance in an attempt to shed light on how the cyber
security policy and practice of states, both at the national and the
international level, are facilitated or thwarted by the interests and
practices of actors that are not easily visible, in- and outside of
governments.

A second key challenge or indeed an opportunity for cyber security
politics research is linked to the fact that more data about cyber
operations by many different actors around the world and better tools to
monitor and analyze this data are becoming available. While there is
room for theory development and theory testing, we will likely enter an
era of empirical work. In-depth qualitative studies on the role of
invisible actors in state interactions linked to cyber security can be
combined with more data-driven approaches that evaluate how new AI tools
affect the cyber offense-defense balance. As state actors begin to
integrate these tools in their border guards, police corps, armies and
disaster response structures, important social and political questions
will arise linked to privacy, bias, and control. Conversely, governments
and societies will need to discuss how much of this new data should be
made publicly available and what this means for data protection and
privacy. From a research point of view, these developments call for more
interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer science,
mathematics, economics, and political science.

A third key challenge for cyber security politics research is linked to
overcoming the institutional barriers that slow down its independent
contribution to cyber security and cyber security politics. Universities
can help the public actors at the national and international level to
catch up in their technology competence, while educating the next
generation of experts for society and industry.

Myriam Dunn Cavelty and Florian J. Egloff, "Hyper-Securitization,
Everyday Security Practice and Technification: Cyber-Security Logics in
Switzerland," Swiss Political Science Review, vol. 21, no. 1, 2021,
<https://doi.org/10.1111/spsr.12433>

On the other hand, [Everyday Security Practices are invoked frequently
in the Swiss cyber-security discourse.]{.underline} Particularly, [the
idea of individuals as 'responsible' partners is reinforced in the
various cyber-security policy documents and debates]{.underline}. [This
is partially manifest in the credo that everyone is primarily
responsible for their own cyber-security.]{.underline} Such thinking
echoes with the strong political ideal of subsidiarity that demands the
leanest role of the state possible. Th[e responsibility of individuals
in the security of the whole collective is highlighted through calls
towards more awareness and prevention campaigns,]{.underline} informing
the broader public about cyber risks and countermeasures, thereby aiming
to improve prevention and resiliency, security concepts of the
everyday.6 Through the aim of resiliency, [the individual is
discursively constructed as being directly attached to larger security
outcomes of social collectives.]{.underline}

Of all three, [Technification is the most intriguing logic.]{.underline}
[Cyber-security 'experts' with a mostly technical background
drive]{.underline} the Swiss [discourse]{.underline} -- be they ICT
entrepreneurs, specialists, or researchers. [This reflects the
technification of the securitised cyber-security discourse, in that
privilege is given to constructing cyber-security as a primarily
technical issue]{.underline}. Other, [non-technical commentators often
preface their statements]{.underline} with "I am no technical expert,
but\..." [demonstrating the need to legitimise one's own
contributions]{.underline} to a political discourse, when one is not
considered 'technical' This [technified discourse is further visible
throughout policy solutions]{.underline}, be they the way critical
infrastructure risk is measured (i.e. calculated in complex formulas and
statistics), or the state of internet security in Switzerland is
communicated (e.g. how many percent of Swiss websites implement a
particular security technology).

Conclusion

In this contribution, we demonstrated that Swiss [cyber-security
politics can be fruitfully approached with constructivist
research,]{.underline} more specifically, [one that draws on practice
approaches]{.underline}. Of the three securitization logics as described
by Hansen and Nissenbaum, all three are present in the Swiss case, with
technification being the dominant one at present. [For democratic
politics, technification is a particular challenge.]{.underline}
[Assigning an issue to the technical realm has a depoliticizing
influence]{.underline}, [which removes it from democratic
deliberations.]{.underline} By making cyber-security an issue of the
'genius few', [technification makes contestation from those with less
technical expertise very hard if not impossible or makes it easy for
those with the most valued expertise to discredit others without
it.]{.underline} In addition, [the power of technical expertise comes
with a claim of being 'neutral' or 'a-political', and
hence,]{.underline} of being [more valid]{.underline} [than
anything]{.underline} that seems [emotional]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} based on [moral]{.underline}s.

The Swiss case also highlights interesting aspects for securitization
research and beyond. In theory, [securitization assumes that there is
one powerful actor who can make a convincing case for the exceptional
nature of a policy issue]{.underline}. [The entire Swiss political
system works against this]{.underline}. [**There are always multiple
voices and multiple audiences to convince** -- which makes it much
harder to be successful in a simple securitization move based on
urgency]{.underline}. In such a political system, **[less 'visible'
bureaucratic actors need to be studied more thoroughly.]{.underline}**
Security is not mainly the domain of security elites and politicians.
Instead, the [research focus needs to shift to everyday security
practices]{.underline}, to less traditional security actors, and to
actors outside government that have a central role in the creation of
danger knowledge and everyday security.

Beyond securitization research, it is evident that [looking closely at
the **intricacies of political systems, power distribution and political
culture,**]{.underline} as studied by scholars in comparative politics
and similar fields, [becomes necessary to understand security logics in
any policy field]{.underline}. **[Bringing the two research traditions
more closely together]{.underline}** in some form of conversation across
sub-disciplinary boundaries **[could be beneficial for
both.]{.underline}**

**Cyber securitization is inevitable AND good -- recognizing the threat
is key to developing necessary protections**

between digital rights and national security in cyberspace.

CYBERSPACE," Royal Holloway University of London, 2019,
https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-cyber-security-dilemma-and-the-securitisation-of-cyberspace(dcf65dd5-c75d-40ce-8994-6da979eaa1e7).html

5.2 SHOULD CYBERSPACE BE DESECURITISED?

[**Desecuritisation** is the process by which an issue is removed from
the security sphere and is **no longer considered to be an urgent
threat**]{.underline}, requiring exceptional measures to counter. For
the Copenhagen School, 'it means not to have issues phrased as "threats
against which me have countermeasures" but to move them out of this
threat-defense sequence and into the ordinary public sphere' (Busan, et
al., 1998, p. 29).

But [**desecuritisation is difficult to achieve once an issue has been
accepted as threatening** and **desecuritisation does not guarantee than
an issue will become re- politicised** and re-open to public
debate]{.underline}. [If securitising moves are rejected forcefully
enough, then **issues can become both de-securitised and
de-politicised**]{.underline} (See Figure 5.1). [This means that **not
only are the issues considered non- threatening, but they are also
closed for discussion**]{.underline}. Islamic extremism and immigration
are issues that are often difficult to discuss in a political
environment because they are either securitised as existentially
threatening or de-politicised because the responses to them are
considered threatening, racist or intolerant.

Cyberspace scholars are in general agreement that cyberspace
securitisation has mainly negative consequences. Kingsmith, for example,
discusses the negative consequences that emerge from moves by states to
securitise internet content.

Considering these securitising moves \... the more that filtering
practices are withheld from public scrutiny and accountability, the more
tempting it is for framing authorities to employ these tools for
illegitimate reasons such as the stifling of both opposition and civil
society networks (Kingsmith, 2013, p. 1).

Deibert also highlights the negative consequences of the securitisation
of cyberspace, including the resultant threats to basic freedoms.

[There has been a **growing recognition of serious risks in
cyberspace**]{.underline}. The need to manage these risks has led to a
wave of securitization efforts that have potentially serious
implications for basic freedoms (Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010, p. 49).

Whilst arguing that the securitisation of cyberspace is negative and
inevitable, Deibert also contends that the form of [this
**securitisation can be influenced**. 'The **securitization of
cyberspace may be inevitable**, but what form that security takes is
not']{.underline} (Deibert, 2012, p. 274). He suggests that it is better
to securitise threats to human rights than to securitise threats to
national security. Mariya Georgieva takes this further, citing the
Snowden disclosures as an example of the securitisation of digital
rights, arguing that Snowden had 'successfully shifted the focus of the
securitisation of cyberspace from values such as the survival of the
state and effective national security to the survival of privacy and
personal choice' (Georgieva, 2015, p. 44). Whilst she celebrates this
shift she does not explain why it is better to securitise privacy rather
than national security. Helen [Nissenbaum is one author who does take a
more consequentialist approach to cyberspace securitisation, arguing
that **it might be justified when the threat is as extreme** as its
proponents claim.]{.underline}

[If those who subscribe to a conception of security as cybersecurity are
right, particularly **if the magnitude of threat is as great as those on
the extremes claim, then an extraordinary response is warranted despite
its chilling effects**]{.underline} (Nissenbaum, 2005, p. 73).

However, this approach is rare and most literature is either critical of
state surveillance and the securitisation of cyberspace, or is
complimentary of Edward Snowden and supportive of the securitisation of
individual privacy. Given that a narrow majority of the British public
support greater efforts to protect national security it is surprising
that academic literature is weighted so strongly towards criticisms of
state surveillance and the securitisation of national security (Pew
Research Centre, 2016). Even when cyberspace securitisation by non-state
actors is addressed, such as in Georgieva's work on Snowden as an
alternative securitizing actor, [these forms of securitisation are
**considered positive** because they **support human
rights**.]{.underline} In the US and UK, academics have also been
politically active in opposing state surveillance. In 2014 over one
thousand scholars from a wide range of disciplines formed the 'academics
against surveillance' campaign, which published an open letter
criticising state surveillance (Electronic Frontier Foundation, 2014).

Whilst there is disagreement over whether desecuritisation is always
best and what types of securitisation should be reversed, there are a
variety of means through which desecuritisation can be achieved.

**[1AR\-\--Securitization Good]{.underline}**

**Even if cyber securitization is bad, it's inevitable and necessary --
their alt ensures infrastructure attacks and cyber crimes**

**Pickin 12** -- MA in War Studies and University of London

Matthew Pickin, "What is the securitization of cyberspace? Is it a
problem?," University of London, 2012,
https://www.academia.edu/3100313/What_is_the_securitization_of_cyberspace_Is_it_a_problem

In analysing the problems of securitization, major issues have been
raised. Threat inflation, surveillance, militarisation and the
military-industrial complex are only some of the most prominent issues.
[There are **benefits of securitization** however]{.underline}, and at
the very end of this analysis [it]{.underline} will be explained why
**[securitization is necessary for now]{.underline}**. The main
supporting arguments for securitization include, the future of
cyber-attacks in conflicts, protecting critical infrastructure and
cyber-crime.

The 2010 National Intelligence Annual Threat Assessment stated that [the
United States was under a severe threat of cyber-attacks]{.underline}
(Blair, 2010). Due to the amount of infrastructure connected to the
internet in the United States targets for cyber-attacks are nearly
unlimited, as a superpower the United States presents a valuable target.
"As the world's hegemonic power, [the United States is also the **main
target** state that dissident groups, terrorists, and rogue states wish
to damage]{.underline} (Valeriano & Maness, 2011, p. 145)." [Therefore,
the **United States must have some defence, or offensive capability in
order to protect itself from future conflicts and attacks on critical
infrastructure**]{.underline}. In Foreign Affairs William J Lynn the
former deputy secretary of defence wrote that the centrality of
information technology in the United States makes it a prime target. He
argued that extending advanced cyber-defences was crucial for the
American economy, and also stated that [**failure of critical
infrastructure** would **compromise national defence**]{.underline},
"Our assessment is that [**cyber-attacks** will be a **significant
component** of future conflicts]{.underline} (Lynn, 2011)." Therefore
**[in order to protect the United States, the government has been forced
to securitize the issue]{.underline}**. According to William J Lynn an
attack could compromise national defence; therefore the issue is very
high in the national security agenda. In the article, he also addresses
the critics who argue that cyberspace is at risk of being militarized
and states that US cyber strategy has been designed to prevent this from
happening, "Far from militarizing cyberspace, U.S. cyber-strategy will
make it more difficult for military actors to use cyberspace for hostile
purposes (Lynn, 2011)." [In **securitizing cyberspace** and creating
advanced cyber-defences and cyber-weapons the United States is
**preparing for any future conflict or attack.** If such an attack or
conflict is a real existing threat then it is **beneficial to prepare
through securitization**]{.underline}, otherwise the disadvantages
clearly outweigh any advantage.

[The other **main benefit** of **securitizing cyberspace** would be
**tackling cyber-crime**]{.underline}. According to the security company
Sophos, in the first six months of 2010 it received 60,000 new malware
samples every day. Apart from malware, cyber-crime covers many different
areas such as financial, piracy, hacking and cyber-terrorism. [These
crimes are growing due to the constantly evolving communications system
of social sharing of data]{.underline}, online data storage and social
networking, "Although cybercrime has formed a hidden shadow and a kind
of evil doppelganger to every step of the Internet's long history from
its very origins, its growth has suddenly become explosive in recent
years by virtually any estimate (Deibert & Rohozinski, Contesting
Cyberspace and the Coming Crisis of Authority, 2012, p. 28)." Both
Deibert and Rohozinski argue that the rise is cyber-crime has become a
big problem for states, in 2011 counterfeiting and copying cost the
Asia-Pacific region almost \$21 billion. Certainly cyber-space has
become a rewarding way to commit crimes with little risk of prosecution,
"Cybercrime has elicited so little prosecution from the world's law
enforcement agencies it makes one wonder a de facto decriminalization
has occurred (Deibert & Rohozinski, Contesting Cyberspace and the Coming
Crisis of Authority, 2012, p. 29)." [Due to the trouble of cyber-crime,
**the only way of combating it effectively would be greater state
regulation and intervention**]{.underline}. With the whole of
cyber-space effectively securitized by the United States due to the
threat to national security by technological and social shifts, the
government is asserting itself increasingly to counter these threats.

Conclusion

In analysing what was the securitization of cyberspace, the beginnings
of the cyber-debate in the United States have been examined; this
country was used due to reliance on information technology and the
status as a superpower. The securitization model from the Copenhagen
school of thought was used to understand how issues are non-politicized,
politicized and eventually securitized. A different range of security
bills have been examined with this model to understand what was needed
for cyberspace to become a securitized issue. With the definition of
securitization dependent on the terms of national security, the changing
definition of this concept was also examined. Securitization has
occurred due to an evolving history whereby the military have understood
the potential of information technologies in warfare and where
vulnerabilities have been recognised that could damage national
security.

In evaluating whether securitization of cyberspace is a problem, it is
very clear that securitization is a growing concern with many
complications. There are many issues including privacy, regulation,
surveillance, internet regulation and the growing tension in the
international system. However, [because the United States is a
superpower contesting with other cyber-heavyweights such as Iran, Russia
and China **the issue will not be de-securitized in the short
term**]{.underline}. With the discovery and use of cyber-weapons, [many
states are in the process of making their own for defensive and
offensive purposes. The government of the **United States will not
de-securitize the issue of cyberspace while there are rival states and
groups which prove a threat to the national security
agenda**]{.underline}. These problems will continue to exist until there
is no defensive agenda and the issue is de-securitized, [for now
**securitization is a necessary evil**.]{.underline}

Cluster 1: [The **reality of cyber conflict**]{.underline}: Explaining
state restraint and practices

[In the **beginning** of this **intellectual history**, political
aspects of **cyber security**]{.underline} [were discussed almost
**exclusively** in publications]{.underline} originating in U.S.
**[think tanks]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[war
colleges]{.underline}** (for example: Arquilla & Ronfeldt, 1992). [This
literature had **little ambition**]{.underline} to contribute to an
academic debate. The two main questions it tackled were "who (or what)
is the biggest danger for an increasingly networked
nation/society/military/business environment" and "how to best counter
the new and evolving threat."

[The]{.underline} first [cluster is characterized by a
**reevaluation**]{.underline} [of the threat based on **empirical
evidence**]{.underline} [and a **gradual application**]{.underline} [and
adaption of "**old**]{.underline}" **[IR]{.underline}** [and strategic
studies]{.underline} [concepts to **cyber security**]{.underline}
(Kello, 2013). [Two cyber incidents]{.underline}--[the discovery of
**Stuxnet**]{.underline} [in 2010 and later the **Snowden
disclosures**]{.underline} in 2013--[were **instrumental**]{.underline}
in [shifting the focus of both **policymakers**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[researchers]{.underline}** [from the **threat
politics** of "**what if**]{.underline}"-[scenarios that had dominated
the 1990s and early 2000s]{.underline} [to the **reality** of the
**strategic use**]{.underline} [of **cyberspace**]{.underline} [by state
actors.]{.underline} In this new context, [literature in **IR**
and]{.underline} **[strategic studies]{.underline}** [could be used to
examine how **state actors**]{.underline} [use cyber instruments for
their **political** or **military advantage**]{.underline} and analyze
their impact on national and international security (Borghard &
Lonergan, 2017; Kello, 2017; Maness & Valeriano, 2016). [A strong
disciplinary]{.underline} "**[pull]{.underline}**" is [visible in how
early works **zoomed**]{.underline} in [on an alleged **offensive
advantage**]{.underline} in [cyberspace due to the ubiquity of technical
vulnerabilities (Peterson, 2013), grappled with the problem of
**escalation dynamics** in cyberspace]{.underline} (Liff, 2012), and
asked how deterrence might be adapted in order to uphold stability in
cyberspace (Wilner, 2019).

As researchers began to build data sets of cyber operations (Kostyuk &
Zhukov, 2019; Valeriano & Maness, 2014) to link cyber issues to the
larger agenda of conflict studies, [an empirical puzzle emerged that
**challenged** many of the **theoretical tenets**]{.underline} [and
standards assumptions of the **older literature**]{.underline}. Most
cyber operations did not seem escalatory, nor were they determined by
power asymmetries or changed the existing strategic balance.
**[Overall]{.underline}**, [states seemed to exercise a fair
amount]{.underline} of **[restraint]{.underline}** in cyberspace
(Gartzke, 2013; Gartzke & Lindsay, 2015; Valeriano & Maness, 2015).
**[At the same time, however]{.underline}**, [a lot of cyber operations
linked to **state rivalries occurred**]{.underline}, though as mere
add-ons to existing conflict dynamics and not independent of a broad
range of other foreign policy instruments (Betz & Stevens, 2011).

Reacting to this puzzle, the literature in this cluster has begun to
move in two directions: First, and comparable to the evolution of the
strategic studies literature during the nuclear age, some
[authors]{.underline} have started to integrate additional non-systemic
explanatory factors into their analyses of cyber conflict. While some
[explore the role of beliefs]{.underline} [and **cognitive
biases**]{.underline} in cyber policy decision making (Gomez, 2019),
[others]{.underline} zoom in on the destabilizing role of bureaucratic
politics and other deficiency of the policy process especially in crisis
decision making. Second, and more consequentially, many authors
acknowledge that the emerging empirical picture reflects the structural
feature of cyberspace as an operating environment, which is marked by a
high degree of technical interconnectedness and constant political
contestation (Fischerkeller & Harknett, 2018; Smeets, 2018). Taking this
into account, operating strategically in cyberspace seems to be more
technically and organizationally demanding than the "cheap and
easy"-metaphor suggests, while at the same time offering little enduring
strategic gains in the sense of changing a rival's political goals
(Lewis, 2018; Slayton, 2017).

**[2AC\-\--Realism Good]{.underline}**

**A focus on the state is still necessary and appropriate. Critical
approaches fail because they focus on [theory]{.underline} and
[abstraction]{.underline} over empirical data.**

In 2006, [Eriksson and Giacomello stated]{.underline} that the
discipline of international relations (**[IR]{.underline}**) [was
struggling to **apply**]{.underline} [its]{.underline} varied
theoretical [toolbox]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the topic of **[cyber
security]{.underline}**, therein [detecting]{.underline} "great
[difficulties for theoretical adaptation]{.underline} and application in
analyses of the complexities of the emerging new digital world" (p.

to]{.underline} interlinked [changes occurring in the
**fields**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[technology]{.underline}**,
[politics, and **science**]{.underline}, [research that applies

studies [theory to different facets of the]{.underline}
**[phenomenon]{.underline}** [is no longer as **rare**]{.underline},
inviting us to look at this emergent body of research in depth at this
point in time (for a similar undertaking see Deibert, 2017a, 2017b).

This special issue displays the latest wave of cyber security politics
research. The articles position themselves mostly in a post-positivist
research tradition and use a set of different theories and conceptual
frameworks to analyze the current state of cyber security in politics.
Some articles examine the contested nature of public attributions of
cyber incidents, the norm-setting day-to-day behavior of intelligence
agencies, and discuss the consequences for governments and governance.
Another group of articles explores the knowledgeshaping practices of
IT-security companies, the co-production of risks and vulnerabilities by
technology and experts, and aim at better understanding the role of
firms and experts in strategic state interactions.

In this introductory article, we provide the intellectual history to
situate the literature in its broader evolutionary context. In a first
part, inspired by Buzan and Hansen's framework from their "The Evolution
of International Security Studies" (2009), we discuss six drivers that
have been influential in the evolution of (Western) cyber security
politics and how it is studied. In a second part, we identify three
clusters of research. In each of them, we highlight the interplay
between technological possibilities and political choices of state
actors in combination with scientific factors. [The focus on "**the
state**]{.underline}" [is]{.underline} **[appropriate and
necessary]{.underline}**, [because **security** politics is **inevitably
tied** to questions of **authority and power**]{.underline}. That said,
[the state is not the **only**]{.underline} [important actor in this
space]{.underline}--rather, [it is at the **intersection**]{.underline}
[between state and nonstate actors, nationally and
internationally]{.underline}, [that the **specificities**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[cyber security]{.underline}** [politics
emerge]{.underline}.

In the conclusion, we use these same drivers to look into the possible
future of cyber security politics research. We claim that it should not
be conceptualized as a sub-field of anything, so that inquiry is not
overly restricted by the disciplining power of disciplines. Cyber
security transcends levels of analysis, necessitates considerable
interdisciplinary knowledge, and will be shaped by the availability of
new data and methods. Its relevance for society is likely to become even
bigger in the future, with new digital technologies expanding the
spatial boundaries of cyberspace and with new complex issues emerging.
Scientific knowledge of both the problem-solving and the reflexive kind
is crucial to understand what politics these technologies will have and
how they will be linked to broader socio-economic changes affecting the
society, the economy, and the state in the future.

Factors driving the evolution of cyber security politics research

Mapping a body of research is no trivial and certainly no purely
objective undertaking. In order to simplify and abstract, a series of
choices have to be made about what to include and what to exclude. As
critical cartographers know, "\[m\]apping is epistemological but also
deeply ontological -- it is both a way of thinking about the world,
offering a framework for knowledge, and a set of assertions about the
world itself" (Kitchin, Perkins, & Dodge, 2009, p. 1). First, we hone in
on "cyber security politics," highlighting two areas that help to
structure the debate. What we aim for in these pages is an understanding
of cyber security politics that is flexible enough to deal with the
dynamics of the phenomenon, yet precise enough to demarcate the research
focus sufficiently to be of use. Second, and loosely following Buzan and
Hansen (2009), we identify six driving forces that explain the dynamic
co-evolution of cyber security politics and the academic engagement with
it. These factors help us to understand what researchers choose to write
about, what subjects and issues they define as the main cyber security
problem(s) and which ontologies, epistemologies, and methods carry
legitimacy (Buzan & Hansen, 2009, pp. 39--40).

Staking out cyber security politics

What is "cyber security" and how is it related to security politics? Far
from allowing a straightforward answer, this question lies at the heart
of the political and academic debates about the issue. First, cyber
security is a relatively new term for a set of older practices around
the security of computer networks (Von Solms & Van Niekerk, 2013).
Second, definitions for the term are contested, exemplified by the
refusal of some state actors to agree on a common vocabulary (Giles &
Hagestad, 2013). Third, the meaning of the term is changing across time.
Not so long ago, a limited circle of experts discussed cyber security
primarily as a technical risk management issue in critical information
infrastructure protection. Now the highest government circles deal with
cyber security as a key challenge of national security (Dewar, 2018).
Fourth, parallel to the advancing digitalization of ever more aspects of
the economy, society, and politics, cyber security concerns are
expanding to additional policy domains (Dunn Cavelty & Egloff, 2019). In
sum, cyber security is at the same time moving upwards in the political
agenda and expanding sideways as a problem area to a multitude of
additional policy domains.

Simple and static definitions are not well suited to deal with
constantly changing contexts. However, if we look down on the conceptual
space from a sufficient height, we notice that cyber security politics'
common ground is characterized by two main factors: First, by digital
technologies, specifically their use and misuse by human actors in
economic, social, and political contexts; and second, by enduring and
often highly conflictual negotiation processes in formal and informal
settings between the state and its bureaucracies, society, and the
private sector, geared towards defining roles, responsibilities, legal
boundaries and acceptable rules of behavior.1

The first dimension is tied to the use of a set of distinct digital
technologies and how these technologies are linked to broader
conceptions of socio-economic changes (Papp, Alberts, & Tuyahov, 1997).
The marriage of computers and telecommunications, the integration of
these technologies into a global multimedia system, and their worldwide
inexpensive availability is the bedrock for heralding multiple, rapid
and consequential transformations in production, management, societal
interaction, and governance (Schwab, 2018) though it remains to be seen
just how revolutionary these changes will really be. The most pertinent
questions in cyber security politics with regard to digital technologies
are what their characteristics are, what actions they make possible and
which ones they restrain, but also who develops them in what ways and
why and who has the power to shape their use and misuse.

The second dimension is tied to the role of states and their engagement
with other actors nationally and internationally. "Security" in cyber
security politics can be read in two ways: As cyber security politics
(the security political aspects of the issue) or as cyber security
politics (the politics engaging with questions of cyber security more
broadly). This ambiguity is deliberate because we consider the question
of what type of politics emerges under what kind of rules and with what
kind of boundaries to be crucial. From a theoretical point of view, the
question of how much politics there is or should be in security--and how
much security in politics--allows us to link research in cyber security
to debates in security studies (Hagmann, Hegemann, & Neal, 2019).
Importantly, the state has different roles in cyber security, ranging
from security guarantor, legislator and regulator, to threat actor and
danger to society and other states (Dunn Cavelty & Egloff, 2019). Hence,
cyber security politics are defined by national and international
negotiation processes about the boundaries of the responsibilities of
state, economic, and societal actors and the agreement or disagreement
over the means these actors use. This second dimension includes the
projection of power by certain actors, like the control over populations
and information flows, and the push-back against it as well.

Six driving factors

In their intellectual history of international security studies, Buzan
and Hansen develop a framework of five interrelated factors (2009, pp.
39-- 100)--great power politics, technology, key events, academic
debates, and institutionalization--that drove the evolution of the
field. For cyber security politics, we propose a slightly different
framework, purporting that changes in research are linked to changes in
the empirical phenomenon, whereby these changes can go both ways: A
research phenomenon often influences directions of research, but
research also illuminates aspects of the phenomenon that have gone
unnoticed before. We focus on the interrelationship between technology
and the world of policy and state practice--on what political actors say
they are doing and on what they are doing in the field of cyber security
as a political issue, both nationally and internationally, often in
relation to other actors--and on the different ways to observe this
interrelationship (Figure 1). The intellectual history of cyber security
politics is thus shaped by the interplay of three broad spheres:
Technology, Politics, and Science.2 Technological dynamics interact with
social and political dynamics. Technological possibilities and
constraints influence socio-economic processes. In turn, political
preferences and contexts shape the evolution of digital technologies.
This also applies fundamentally to the actors developing these
technologies and to the dynamic interplay of cyber security markets and
cyber security politics. Within each of the three spheres, we identify
two main drivers. In different combinations during different times,
these six factors stimulate or dissuade scholars from picking up
specific research questions. A summary can be seen in Table 1, with a
more detailed description in what follows.

Technology as a driver

It seems like an obvious choice to include "technology" as a category,
since the issue of cyber security is linked to the development and use
of cyberspace, a technological environment entirely built by humans. Yet
scholars have rightly pointed out that the vision of one unique
cyberspace is itself based on a social construction (Bingham, 1996;
Graham, 1998). Indeed, the conception of what cyberspace is and what can
be done with it has changed considerably throughout its history,
highlighting the needfor historically contingent understandings of the
development and use of technologies. However, a core characteristic of
IR scholarship's dealing with digital technology is "technological
determinism" (Herrera, 2003). The majority of IR approaches chooses to
deal with technology as an exogenous variable (McCarthy, 2018, p. 4),
seeing technologies as a material objects or power resources that drive
social change or as neutral tools that acquire meaning only through
their use (Leese & Hoijtink, 2019).

In contrast, we understand technologies as embodiments of societal
knowledge in the tradition of science and technology studies (STS), as
sites where power relations can be seen in operation and where the
shaping and coordination of the behavior of social and political actors
happens (Behrent, 2013, p. 57). During the design stage of technologies,
the intentions, norms, and values of their developers find their way
into the artefacts, while existing power structures influence the
desirability of specific aspects or forms of technology. Once
technologies diffuse, they are often given particular meanings and
acquire purposes other than the one initially intended by their
developers (Matthewman, 2011), but always within certain inescapable
material bounds (see also Fischerkeller & Harknett, 2018). For example:
A pen can be used for writing, but it can also be used to stab someone.
It can, however, not be used to make phone calls.

\[\[Table Omitted\]\]

That digital technologies "have politics" is hardly a contested
statement (Deibert, 2003, 2013; DeNardis, 2014; Mueller, 2010; Price,
2018). Design decisions made by engineers in the late 1960s have
implications until today, especially for security. From the early
prototype phase as ARPANET (1967- 1972) to the gradual development into
"the Internet" (1973-1983), technological protocols that define how data
is exchanged were written in an egalitarian spirit (Naughton, 2016). The
decision to have a system with minimal rules that had no central power
and no censor was deliberate and based on philosophical and political
beliefs of the technical community (Berners-Lee, 1999). Cyber security
as we understand it today became an issue only gradually, when the
system architecture changed from large proprietary machines with little
connection to "smaller and far more open systems (not built with
security in mind) coupled with the rise of networking" (Libicki, 2000),
yet still ran on the same basic protocols.

The perception that cyberspace is creating and perpetuating insecurity
with potentially catastrophic consequences is shaped by different key
events linked to the technological sphere as a second important driving
factor. In line with what we noted above, these events are not
understood as causal forces that unidirectionally influence politics or
science (cf. Buzan & Hansen, 2009, p. 54ff.) but rather as interrelated
catalyzers. The category consists of events outside the cyber realm with
influence on cyber security politics (examples include 9/11, the Snowden
revelations, or the Arab Spring), and cyber incidents themselves. In its
most basic form, a cyber incident is a disruption that challenges the
normal operation of digital technologies. Undesired change inside
machines create technical effects. Yet these technical effects alone are
not sufficient to explain the salience of cyber security in politics.
Between the initial effect in the machine and the political effect lies
a knowledge production process that creates an incident embedded in a
specific social context. A technical effect needs to be discursively
linked to something with sufficient social or political value to become
security politically relevant--which also explains why only some cyber
incidents reach that stage while others do not (Balzacq & Dunn Cavelty,
2016).

Such moments of disruption highlight previously hidden characteristics
of socio-technical artifacts, opening up opportunities for the study of
new aspects of the phenomena that were not easily observable before or
did not seem important (Best & Walters, 2013, p. 346; Latour, 1999).
Incidents are also linked to another fundamental issue in the study of
cyber security: the availability of data. Our current knowledge about
cyber security relies heavily on data from commercial threat reporting
and news reports. Yet this data provides a partial and biased view of
cyber threat activity, because it is often politicized and influenced by
the demands of powerful buyers and the interests of capable providers
(Lindsay, 2017).

Politics as a driver

The discipline of **[IR]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} mainly
[interested in patterns of **cooperation**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[conflict]{.underline}** [among
**states**]{.underline} [and how these patterns relate to shifts in the
distribution]{.underline} and **[character of power]{.underline}** [in
the international system]{.underline}: international power politics.
[As]{.underline} the issue of **[cyber security]{.underline}** [gained
in importance in **state interactions**]{.underline}, [experts and
policy makers pondered whether **digital technologies**]{.underline}
[gave rise to a "**new**"]{.underline} type of **[power]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [how this power source would influence the
**existing** power **distribution**]{.underline} [in the
system]{.underline} (Nye, 2011). Given that IR began as an "American
discipline, was focused on American security and written by Americans"
(Buzan & Hansen, 2009, p. 51), the debate about the security
implications arising from the spread of information technologies also
originated in America, with a series of implications for how the subject
was studied. Though definitions vary, cyber power is understood as the
use of resources related to cyberspace to achieve specific (political)
ends inside and outside of cyberspace (cf. Nye, 2010, p. 3). In the
contemporary U.S. setting, a discourse of simultaneous empowerment and
disempowerment characterized the conceptual debate from the beginning.
While the technological realm carried the promise of wielding a new sort
of power, it highlighted new dependencies and vulnerabilities at the
same time (Rattray, 2001).

Apart from giving the digital domain a particular weight in the broader
questions that IR scholars are interested in, [we]{.underline} also
[need to consider]{.underline} [how]{.underline} **[international
politics]{.underline}** [influence the **use** of **these
technologies**]{.underline}. [Given the **interconnection**
between]{.underline} **[technology]{.underline}** [and politics, we can
expect the **overall state** of **world politics**]{.underline} to [have
a noticeable influence on the forms of **use**/misuse of]{.underline}
**[these technologies]{.underline}**. [Buzan and Hansen call this larger
context "**patterns of enmity** and amity between **great
powers**]{.underline}" (2009, p. 52). [This highlights questions of
cooperation and conflict]{.underline}, about the formation of alliances
and the maintenance of strategic stability, about the proliferation and
control of dual-use technologies, but also about the efforts of states
to come to international agreements in the form of norms and
institutions.

[In our conception of politics, the **international
dimension**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} just **[one
aspect]{.underline}** [of a broader set of political
interactions]{.underline}. [Cyber security is **not only**]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} **[enmity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[amity]{.underline}** [and the potential for]{.underline}
**[war]{.underline}** and peace. In fact, [it is not very often about
situations of great urgency]{.underline}, [but more often]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} "**[normal" domestic politics]{.underline}**. Like
many other complex policy issues, **[cyber security]{.underline}** is
[cutting across different areas of **responsibility**]{.underline},
[requiring coordination and cooperation between a wide **variety** of
**public actors**]{.underline} at different levels of government, but
also actors from business and society When government tasks and
authority are delegated downwards (localization), upwards
(supranationalization), or sideways (privatization) (Krahmann, 2003),
governance in networks becomes important. Under such conditions,
governments no longer simply issue instructions and monitor their
implementation, but seek to shape the framework conditions so that
cooperation operates as smoothly as possible even without constant
oversight (Peters & Pierre, 1998; Salamon, 2002), coming with a set of
challenges for state-society relationships.

Science as a driver

The last two factors are situated in the realm of science that is
understood here as a collective term for "academic work," "intellectual
labor," or "knowledge production." Like Buzan and Hansen (2009, pp.
57-65), we focus on academic debates and on institutionalization. This
introduces an element of internal conflict into our intellectual
history, because even if academics would agree on the key events or
issues that need to be studied, how they would study it would still
differ widely. As a case in point, cyber security politics research is
no subfield of anything--it is characterized and united by the
engagement with a multifaceted and dynamic phenomena, but the
disciplinary approaches used, the ontological and epistemological
choices, vary greatly.

Debates about ontology, epistemology, and methodology are at the heart
of some of the most fruitful key debates in security studies, but at the
same time they divide the discipline. [The biggest
**cleft**]{.underline} [exists between **problem-solving** theories and
**critical theories**]{.underline}: the former do not explicitly
question the prevailing social and power relationships, while the latter
problematize these very relationships by analyzing their origins and
their evolution (Cox, 1986). [Which of these two approaches is
**favored**]{.underline} [in certain research settings however
**depends**]{.underline} [on many different factors]{.underline}
(Bourbeau, Balzacq, & Dunn Cavelty, 2015). Building on decades of IR
scholarship, **[traditional approaches]{.underline}** [have seen
**incremental**]{.underline} **[theoretical innovation]{.underline}**
[since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. By [contrast, **critical
approaches**]{.underline} [have gone through a phase of rich
**theory**]{.underline} development [and are only
**slowly**]{.underline} [becoming ripe for **empirical
work**]{.underline} based on critical methods (Aradau, Huysmans, Neal, &
Voelkner, 2014). The key focus of interest has been the analysis of the
(social) power relations that underpin security policies in liberal
states, highlighting security as a powerful political technology for
social (and political) control (Dillon & Reid, 2009); as a collection of
discourses that serve to empower and reproduce hierarchies (Shepherd,
2008); or as routinized and patterned practices carried out by
bureaucrats and security professionals (Bigo, 2002). These overall
research trends have an important impact on cyber security politics
research, since the topic has been picked up by all approaches, leading
to distinct takes on what cyber security politics is and how it should
be studied.

**[Automation]{.underline}** [doesn't change the fact that

**[Foreign policy]{.underline}**, like all politics, [is a factor of
**human condition**, including sense, gut feeling and cultural cues,
along with its **imperfections**]{.underline}. [However, there is a

**[data]{.underline}**-centric **[world]{.underline}**.
[Diplomacy]{.underline} too, can [retain its **relevance**]{.underline}
[and influence over **politics** between **nations**]{.underline}, so
[long as it can properly designate areas where

Although all **[states]{.underline}** [will come up with their **own

which automation and foreign policy is headed is more or less similar
for all countries. In the future, diplomacy has to build data processing
and management capabilities, with dedicated departments and scientists
supporting diplomats and negotiators on the ground. The structure of
this new framework will also heavily depend on regime type, scope of
foreign interests and alliance behavior.

[The structural shadow of **uncertainty**]{.underline} over diplomacy is
[stronger than ever]{.underline}. [Some]{.underline} communicative
rituals and **[practices]{.underline}** of diplomacy [are]{.underline}
[growing]{.underline} more **[obsolete]{.underline}**, as modern
political communication slides increasingly to short and sharp rhetoric,
coupled with automation tools that bombard audiences at unprecedented
