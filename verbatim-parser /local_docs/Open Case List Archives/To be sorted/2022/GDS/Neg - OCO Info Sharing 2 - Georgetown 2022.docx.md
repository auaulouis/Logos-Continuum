#### The GOP despises NATO\-\--empirics, Kremlin sympathy, and isolationism all prove  

Saletan 22 -- Saletan, William: "Putin Wants to Break NATO. Republicans
Want to Help Him." The Bulwark, 12 Apr. 2022,
www.thebulwark.com/putin-wants-to-break-nato-republicans-want-to-help-him/.
Accessed 24 June 2022. 

Vladimir [Putin's]{.underline} [central objective]{.underline} in Europe
[isn't to capture Kyiv, the Donbas, or any other part of Ukraine. It's
to weaken the North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline}, which
protects most of the continent against him. And in that longstanding
campaign, Putin scored two significant victories this week. 

One was [in France, where Marine Le Pen, a [Putin
sympathizer](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/24/world/europe/marine-le-pen-of-france-meets-with-putin-in-moscow.html),
finished a close second to Emmanuel Macron in Sunday's French
presidential election. Le Pen is running [almost
even](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-faces-tough-fight-france-votes-sunday-2022-04-10/) with
Macron in polls for the April 24 runoff. She has said that if she wins,
she'll [withdraw
France](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220304-ukraine-war-puts-france-s-nato-sceptic-presidential-candidates-in-a-tight-spot) from
NATO's command structure.]{.underline} 

The [other victory was in the United States, where 63 House Republicans,
nearly a third of the GOP conference, voted [against a resolution of
support](https://clerk.house.gov/evs/2022/roll115.xml) for
NATO.]{.underline} 

The [House vote, taken on April 5, is a warning sign]{.underline}. Putin
may be losing ground in Ukraine, but he's [gaining ground in the U.S.
Congress]{.underline}. Three years ago, [[22 House
Republicans](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/201944) voted against
pro-NATO legislation. That number has nearly tripled.]{.underline} 

The "[Putin wing" of the House GOP]{.underline}---useful [idiots such as
Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene]{.underline}, who [openly
spout](https://www.wral.com/us-rep-madison-cawthorn-calls-zelensky-thug/20180199/) Russian [propaganda](https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1512126723164409867)---is
[only a tiny fraction of the Kremlin's target audience in
Congress]{.underline}. They're [joined by a larger crowd of Ukraine
bashers, hardcore isolationists, and right-wingers who say we shouldn't
worry about anyone else's borders until we "secure" our own. Together,
that coalition adds up to [more than 20
lawmakers](https://www.thebulwark.com/whos-soft-on-russia-meet-the-republican-anti-ukraine-caucus/).]{.underline} 

That's a problem. But when you [combine them with the NATO skeptics who
voted against last week's resolution---another 40 or so House
Republicans]{.underline} [who don't trust alliances]{.underline} [and
who view Europeans as America's rivals or adversaries]{.underline}---the
problem gets a lot bigger. 

The GOP's turn against NATO is particularly worrisome because Congress
has been warned, explicitly and repeatedly, about Putin's goal of
dissolving the alliance. In March 2017, after a U.S. intelligence
report [confirmed](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) that
Russia had interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the House
Committee on Foreign Affairs---which was then, like the rest of
Congress, under Republican control---held a hearing on this subject. The
hearing was titled, "[Undermining Democratic Institutions and
Splintering NATO: Russian Disinformation
Aims](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA00/20170309/105674/HHRG-115-FA00-Transcript-20170309.pdf)."
Analysts and former officials explained to the committee how Russia had,
in the words of one witness, persistently funded propaganda in the West
to "fracture allied security, stoke public distrust against democratic
institutions, and discredit the alliance structures that defend
Europe." 

Over the next two years, other reports documented the same problem. The
European Council on Foreign Relations noted Russia's efforts to
undermine support for NATO in [Finland, the Czech Republic, and other
countries](https://ecfr.eu/publication/controlling_chaos_how_russia_manages_its_political_war_in_europe/).
Foreign policy journals and articles in the American press noted [rising
alarm](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/93/2/251/2996077) in Europe
at President Donald Trump's threats to withdraw U.S. troops from the
continent or to abandon the American commitment to defend NATO allies. 

On January 14, 2019, the New York Times reported that "several times" in
2018, [Trump had "[privately said he wanted to
withdraw](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html)"
from the alliance]{.underline}. The article said Trump had "told his top
national security officials that he did not see the point of the
military alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United States." 

A few days after the Times report, House Democrats filed and brought to
the floor the [NATO Support
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/676),
which [reaffirmed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/676/text) that
the U.S. was "solemnly committed to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's principle of collective defense as enumerated
[in]{.underline} Article 5." [The bill]{.underline} couldn't completely
bind Trump, but it expressed the sense of Congress that "the President
shall not withdraw the United States from NATO" and that American policy
was "[to reject any efforts to withdraw the United States from
NATO]{.underline}." It also prohibited the use of federal funds "to take
any action to withdraw the United States" from the alliance. 

Every Democrat voted for the bill; [22 Republicans [voted against
it](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/201944).]{.underline} 

One of the 22 Republicans, Rep. Scott Perry, explained why he and other
self-styled hawks had voted no. In a [statement to
constituents](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2184564228306520&id=376801102416184),
he complained that "the [bill prevented the U.S. from ever leaving
NATO]{.underline} . . . unless Congress first voted to repeal this
would-be new law." Perry wanted Trump to be free to pull America out of
NATO, on his own. 

Perry also argued that Trump should be free "to negotiate better terms
for the United States in NATO," as though the alliance were a trade
deal. And he warned that "an ally of ours today may not be an ally
tomorrow." 

That's how Perry
and [many](https://twitter.com/chiproytx/status/1088080295608365057) of
his [colleagues](https://www.nwfdailynews.com/story/special/special-sections/2019/01/23/gaetz-explains-vote-on-nato-resolution/6218256007/) viewed
the world. [They saw alliances as entanglements and
burdens]{.underline}. [They worried that even friendly countries
couldn't be trusted. They believed that America should hedge its
commitments because our allies might screw us.]{.underline} 

And that was all Putin needed. He didn't need American lawmakers to love
him the way Trump did. He just needed them to constrain or withhold
support from NATO. 

Perry's defection was a particularly good sign for Putin. The
congressman wasn't just an Iraq war veteran. He had also chaired part of
the 2017 hearing on Russia's strategy to undermine NATO. So he must have
known he was doing what Putin wanted. 

But he did it anyway, because he thought he was protecting America from
Europe. 

In the three years since that vote, Congress has seen even more evidence
of Russia's operations to sabotage NATO. 

In April 2019, the Justice Department released the [Mueller
report](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download). It
detailed how Russia had lobbied Trump campaign officials against NATO;
how the Trump campaign, according to one of its own former co-chairs,
had shifted away from "the NATO framework"; and how the Trump team had
blocked Republican platform language that would have endorsed "providing
lethal defensive weapons" to Ukraine. 

In October 2019, the Senate Intelligence Committee released an analysis
of [Russian propaganda
techniques](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf).
The report showed how the Kremlin had sought to "drive wedges in the
Western community alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO." One of
Russia's tricks, the report noted, was "discouraging United States
support" for accepting eastern European countries into NATO by
portraying those countries as "free riders." 

In August 2020, the Senate committee issued a report that showed how
[Kremlin sympathizers had [lobbied the Trump campaign against
NATO](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf)]{.underline}.
The report found that in April 2016, then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie
had advised Trump to affirm in a speech that "our commitment to our NATO
allies in Eastern Europe is absolute" and that "we need to stand up to
Russian aggression together." The Trump campaign had rejected this
language. 

In September 2020, New York Times journalist Michael Schmidt reported
that during Trump's presidency, his then-chief of staff, John Kelly,
had [struggled to stop Trump from pulling
out](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/trump-nato-withdraw.html) of
NATO. In July 2021, Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip
Rucker revealed that Trump had told advisers he would [abandon the
alliance in his second
term](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/07/13/book-excerpt-i-alone-can-fix-it/).
And last month, Trump's former national security adviser, John
Bolton, told the Post that "[Putin was
waiting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/04/bolton-says-trump-might-have-pulled-us-out-nato-if-he-had-been-reelected/)"
for Trump to do just that. 

After all these warnings, and after Putin's latest invasion of Ukraine,
one might have expected the congressional caucus of NATO critics to
shrink. 

Instead, it multiplied. 

Why did so many [Republicans]{.underline} vote against the latest
pro-NATO resolution? 

Some [openly reject the alliance]{.underline}. "[[NATO is a relic of the
Cold
War](https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1511515988843499523),"
said Rep. Thomas Massie]{.underline}. "Why should Americans pay for
Europe's defense?" 

Others said the [U.S. should be wary of overcommitment]{.underline}.
"[We shouldn't say that our support for NATO is
unconditional](https://americasvoice.news/video/cQko2gFlWCIB3aZ/)," said
Rep. Warren Davidson. 

But others, including Perry, complained that the [resolution threatened
American sovereignty]{.underline}. In a video statement, Perry told his
constituents that the resolution "politicizes NATO" by saying "[if
you're not supporting socialism, then we're going to use NATO against
you](https://www.facebook.com/repscottperry/videos/429791295614916)." 

This is a bizarre misrepresentation. The
resolution [affirmed](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/831/text) that
NATO was "founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty,
and the rule of law." Those words are literally in [the alliance's
founding
treaty](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm).
The resolution also called for "unwavering support to the people of
Ukraine." And it endorsed a project, [jointly
proposed](https://turner.house.gov/press-releases?ID=04A29990-6F5C-4465-BE92-6C6C7CF0E8C6) by [Democratic
and Republican
lawmakers](https://connolly.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4509),
to build "NATO's capacity to strengthen democratic institutions within
NATO member, partner, and aspirant countries." 

To make sure nobody misconstrued that language as an attack on
sovereignty, the resolution stipulated that any NATO monitoring of
"challenges to democracy" within member states would be undertaken only
"when requested." 

Perry ignored that stipulation and caricatured the resolution. So did
several of his colleagues. Representative Chip Roy described the
resolution as "[empowering international organizations to target the
internal activities of sovereign
nations](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/06/congress-nato-support-texas-representatives/)."
Davidson described it as "[using NATO to try to undermine America's
sovereignty](https://americasvoice.news/video/cQko2gFlWCIB3aZ/)." 

Some members who opposed the measure also expressed hostility toward
Europe. Davidson said "[global commitments" to accords on climate,
banking, and other issues were forcing the U.S. to adopt the "inferior
system" of "the Europeans."]{.underline} 

Roy fretted that NATO, empowered by the House resolution, would subject
Americans to "[the leftist orthodoxy that now unfortunately permeates
most of Western
Europe](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/06/congress-nato-support-texas-representatives/)." 

These lawmakers think they're patriots. They think that by voting to
limit NATO and America's commitment to it, they're protecting us. And
that's what makes their subversion of the alliance, from Putin's point
of view, so delicious. 

It's so much easier to serve evil when you think you're doing good.

### OCOs Bad 

#### Trying to use OCOs for signaling causes miscalculation and nuke war

Rocks, 4/21/22,
https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/cyber-signaling-and-nuclear-deterrence-implications-for-the-ukraine-crisis/) 

So far, the Biden administration has attempted to dismiss Russia's
announcement as irresponsible saber-rattling. But as Putin continues
issuing nuclear threats, **[policymakers]{.underline}** [are likely to
**feel growing pressure to respond**]{.underline}. In particular, they
[may be tempted to **find ways** to signal to Russia **to deter the use
of nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. One way this might be done is through
[cyber operations]{.underline}. In fact, some cyber experts are already
[calling for the United States]{.underline} [to consider cyber attacks
**for signaling purposes**]{.underline}. For example, writing in the
Washington Post, Dmitri Alperovitch and Samuel Charap call on the Biden
administration to consider a cyber "**[shock-and-awe
demonstration]{.underline}**" in response to a major Russian cyber
attack against the West. They claim that such a response, which could
include [disrupting the Internet]{.underline} throughout Russia, would
signal U.S. resolve and [help prevent further **escalation** that they
fear "**could result in nuclear war**]{.underline}." 

[However, **conducting cyber operations to signal deterrence**
would]{.underline}, paradoxically, **[increase risks of
escalation]{.underline}**. This risk is [not just
hypothetical]{.underline}, especially in light of Russia's [**updated
declaratory policy** for the first use of nuclear weapons]{.underline},
which **[may include responses to cyber attacks]{.underline}**. Russia
has reinforced this message during the war in Ukraine. In early March, a
hacking group affiliated with Anonymous claimed that it had shut down
the control center of Russia's space agency. While denying that the
attack took place, [Russia]{.underline} nevertheless [warned that **a
cyber attack**]{.underline} against its satellites **[would be a
justification for war]{.underline}**. 

The Biden administration should [clearly communicate that cyber
operations for nuclear signaling are out of bounds]{.underline}, just as
it declared restraint in other aspects of this conflict, like the
deployment of American troops to Ukraine. 

How Cyberspace Is Creating Nuclear Risks 

Policymakers and academics are attuned to the cyber risks to nuclear
command and control. The practitioner community has largely focused on
U.S. vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. Scholars, in turn, [worry
about how cyber operations could have **unintended escalatory
consequences**]{.underline}. But less attention has been paid to another
likely scenario: the use of cyber operations for signaling purposes
(operations with visible effects that aim to convey a message to another
state) in a nuclear context. The [**ambiguity of cyber operations** can
sometimes be useful for signaling --- but the same ambiguity **can be
dangerous during a nuclear crisis**]{.underline}. The problem is that
[civilian leaders]{.underline} in particular, distinct from the
military, [are inclined to see cyber attacks as effective signaling
tools]{.underline}. 

[Cyber operations could have **nuclear implications**]{.underline},
especially because modern nuclear command and control systems, like
those in Russia and the United States, [are becoming increasingly
dependent on digital infrastructure.]{.underline} Nuclear command,
control, and communications systems, which include early warning,
information collection, and communications capabilities, alert
decision-makers to impending nuclear strikes and also enable leaders to
control decisions about nuclear use (or non-use). But their digital
dependencies are creating opportunities for exploitation using cyber
means. In a 2020 report, the Nuclear Threat Initiative found that
"almost 9 out of 10 planned nuclear modernization programs involve at
least some new digital components or upgrades." 

[Vulnerabilities inherent in the digital infrastructure]{.underline}
that undergird modern nuclear systems [provide opportunities for actors
to engage in cyber espionage]{.underline} --- gaining access to a
network or system to steal information --- [or]{.underline} even
[conduct cyber attacks]{.underline}. Hypothetically, a cyber power like
Russia could conduct a cyber attack against a U.S. early warning
satellite to degrade its functionality. This has become an urgent
concern for practitioners. U.S. Strategic Command, for instance, is
currently working to "operationally harden NC3 systems against cyber
threats." Congress has also gotten involved, requiring the Defense
Department to evaluate the cybersecurity of major weapon systems. And
the Government Accountability Office has published multiple reports
decrying the state of cybersecurity and scope of vulnerabilities of
weapon systems, including elements of the nuclear triad. 

From an academic perspective, scholars have investigated how cyber
operations targeting nuclear systems could exacerbate escalation risks.
Focusing on nuclear forces, early research, such as work by Martin
Libicki, was skeptical of the dangers posed by cyber operations.
[Nuclear forces were seen as being largely immune from digital attacks
because they were "air gapped,]{.underline}" meaning that they were
[separated from information technology systems]{.underline}. 

However, as [nuclear systems have become increasingly intertwined with
the digital environment]{.underline} --- not to mention the dual-use
nature of many elements of nuclear command, control, and communications
systems (like early warning or position, navigation, and timing
satellites) --- [the protection offered by being segregated]{.underline}
from the internet [is less robust]{.underline}. Jacquelyn Schneider,
Benjamin Schechter, and Rachael Schaffer, for instance, ran a series of
wargames demonstrating that decision-makers in hypothetical crises are
likely to use their cyber exploits against an adversary's nuclear
systems. They found that this could have [negative effects on states'
respective]{.underline} [nuclear strategies]{.underline}, especially
decisions to pre-delegate nuclear launch authority or automate nuclear
responses. Erik Gartzke and Jon Lindsay argue that the clandestine
nature of cyber operations means that [one state could secretly gain
access to an adversary's nuclear command, control, and communications
systems]{.underline}, giving the former an information advantage or even
[creating an incentive for the latter to use its nuclear
weapons]{.underline} [out of the fear]{.underline} that it may lose
them. James Acton notes that the [difficulties of distinguishing between
cyber espionage and attack could lead]{.underline} a state [to
misperceive the intent]{.underline} behind a cyber operation, generating
a similar "use it or lose it" calculus. 

The Limited Escalation Risks of Cyber Operations 

But all of this focus on cyber operations causing nuclear escalation may
be misplaced and, more importantly, distract policymakers from the
[dangers]{.underline} [of a more plausible]{.underline} [scenario: the
use of ambiguous cyber signals during nuclear crises]{.underline}.
Specifically, the nature of cyber operations reduces their inherent
escalatory potential, particularly when compared to other ways a state
could attack an adversary's nuclear forces or command, control, and
communications systems, like a direct counterforce strike or employing
anti-satellite weapons. But their [misuse as a signaling tool could do
more harm than good]{.underline}. 

First, successfully [conducting cyber operations against strategic
targets]{.underline}, like nuclear systems, [is harder than the
conventional wisdom might suggest]{.underline}. It requires a means of
gaining access to a particular system and developing an exploit to cause
a desired effect --- and then maintaining persistent (and stealthy)
access to be able to conduct an offensive operation at the desired time.
Moreover, the [overall outcome may be unpredictable]{.underline} [and
net less-than-desirable results]{.underline}. 

Second, even if a state is able to conduct these kinds of operations,
they typically prefer to do so in secret --- and this mitigates some
escalation concerns. That's because, to cause an escalatory response, a
state like Russia would have to uncover a cyber operation during a
particular time period --- such as while the Ukraine conflict is
unfolding. For example, Russia would have to detect a cyber operation
against a nuclear command and control system to cause Putin to perceive
a "window of vulnerability," perhaps assessing that it is part of a U.S.
or NATO counterforce strategy to disable Russia's ability to retaliate
with nuclear weapons. But the likelihood of these circumstances arising
is low because --- unless a state is trying to signal with a cyber
capability --- it will try to keep these kinds of sensitive operations
secret. Therefore, the chances of such an operation being discovered at
a particular time period are relatively small. 

Finally, even if, hypothetically, Russia was to discover a cyber
operation taking place, the likelihood of it leading to escalation is
low. This is due to the virtual nature of cyber "weapons" --- they
rarely cause destruction in the physical world, let alone permanent
damage. For example, even Russia's 2015 cyber attack against Ukraine's
power grid, an important example of a strategic cyber attack against
civilian critical infrastructure, only resulted in service disruptions
for a few hours. During the current conflict, Russia-linked actors have
so far been stymied in using cyber operations for strategic impact, such
as the failed cyber attack by the group Sandworm against Ukraine's power
grid. 

Taken together, this reasoning suggests that, in practice, cyber
operations may not rise to a level that would cause a state like Russia
to actually fear the integrity of its nuclear command, control, and
communications systems, creating few reasons to escalate to the level of
nuclear employment. 

Civil-Military Relations and the Risks of Cyber Signaling in Nuclear
Crises 

But [what if a state, such as the United States, wanted a cyber
operation to be visible to an adversary, such as Russia, during a
nuclear crisis]{.underline} --- in other words, to [send a cyber
signal?]{.underline} 

Signaling is essential for coercive diplomacy and international crises
because it helps [states convey their intent to one
another]{.underline}. The civil-military relations literature has found
that [**civilian** (rather than military]{.underline}) leaders [are
**more inclined to use military** **force as a form of
signaling**]{.underline}, rather than for operational effect. 

Why does this matter? When civilian and military leaders have different
views, civilians could make decisions around using military force for
signaling purposes in a way that exacerbates ongoing crises. For
instance, writing about Cold War nuclear crises, Scott Sagan has shown
that civilian decision-makers have made crises more dangerous by taking
actions without fully understanding the military implications and risks
of inadvertent escalation. Jack Levy, writing about the causes of World
War I, discusses how, during the July Crisis preceding the outbreak of
war, civilians saw military mobilization as a political tool for
coercive diplomacy, whereas military leaders, who were focused on the
operational implications, perceived mobilization as a means of preparing
for imminent war. 

[Differences in how civilian and military leaders see the use of
military power are likely to be even more salient in cyberspace, for
three reasons]{.underline}. First, [cyberspace is a highly technical
environment where civilians typically lack subject matter
expertise]{.underline}. Practitioners are likely to have far more
up-to-date operational experience and, therefore, fluency with the
technical issues and constraints posed by cyber operations than civilian
leaders (even those with prior and, potentially, outmoded experience).
Cyberspace is also a [highly classified environment]{.underline} --- one
in which information is highly segmented and only accessible to a select
group of individuals. Therefore, some civilian officials may not be
privy to all of the details surrounding cyber operations. Finally,
unlike other technical and secretive environments, cyberspace has an
additional element that makes it even more difficult for non-experts to
grasp its nature. Specifically, [cyberspace is also an esoteric
environment]{.underline}; cyber operations and their effects are not
easily visible in a way that other types of military capabilities are,
making it [difficult to conceptualize their utility]{.underline} [in a
tangible manner]{.underline}. 

There is evidence supporting this idea. For instance, senior civilian
leaders across multiple U.S. administrations, as well as in Congress,
[typically describe cyber operations as useful for signaling deterrence
and resolve]{.underline}. Chris Inglis, the Biden administration's
inaugural National Cyber Director, described how he'd "like to change
the decision calculus of those who transgress in this space," and
contemplated that "\[p\]erhaps our actions should be felt by an
adversary. They should know that they have just felt the hand of
whomever." Similarly, Senator Angus King, discussing the threat of
Russian-linked ransomware attacks in the summer of 2021, noted that he
wants "somebody ... in the Politburo to say, 'Gee, boss, I'm not sure we
ought to do this because we're liable to get whacked in some way by
those Americans.'" 

John **[Bolton]{.underline}**, former national security advisor under
President Donald Trump, in multiple public statements, has
**[depicted]{.underline}** the purpose of [U.S. **cyber
operations**]{.underline} --- especially offensive ones --- [**as a
means of influencing** adversary **perception**]{.underline}. He
described how the employment of offensive cyber power creates
"structures of deterrence, so that it's publicly known," and that "it is
important that our adversaries know \[that\] ...we have authorized
offensive cyber operations to ... demonstrate to our adversaries that
the costs of engaging in operations against us is higher than they want
to bear." [Michael Daniel]{.underline}, the Obama administration's cyber
czar, depicted the purpose of imposing costs on Russia in response to
its 2016 election interference as "to [openly **demonstrate** that we
could do **it as a deterrent** and also clandestinely disrupt their
operations as well]{.underline}." 

In contrast, while some military leaders do talk about cyber deterrence,
the language they employ is anchored in tactical and operational
objectives, rather than aiming to influence adversary perception and
decision-making. This is evident in how both civilian and military
leaders use the language of "imposing costs." Military leaders tend to
describe cost-imposition as supporting the disruption, degradation,
denial, or destruction of adversary offensive capabilities and
operations. For instance, in December 2021, Gen. Paul Nakasone,
commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security
Agency (NSA), described "imposing costs" against Russian-linked
ransomware groups as the goal in itself. The month prior, at the
November 2021 Aspen Security Forum, he argued for the United States to
impose costs in cyberspace, but stated that a traditional deterrence
strategy "does not comport to cyberspace." In another example, in 2019,
Lt. Gen. Stephen Fogarty, commander of Army Cyber Command, voiced
skepticism about cyber deterrence in remarks about defending the 2020
elections against cyber interference, noting that "I don't know of a
single thing we could do that would prevent \[adversaries\] from
competing, but I want to impose as much cost on them as possible." 

Implications for the Ukraine Crisis and Beyond 

What are the [implications of this for the current Ukraine
crisis]{.underline}? Thus far, while cyber operations have been used on
both sides of the conflict, they have not played a decisive role on the
battlefield. So far, [the United States has been focused on providing
cyber defense]{.underline} support to [Ukraine and NATO]{.underline},
reportedly to include dispatching Cyber Command's cyber mission teams to
Eastern Europe, as well as seeking to deter potential Russian cyber
retaliation in response to U.S. and Western sanctions, especially
attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure. 

However, if the nuclear dimension of the crisis becomes more acute,
[**policymakers** may be **tempted to turn to cyber** operations **to**
signal resolve to **deter Russia in the nuclear domain**]{.underline}.
Such an approach could be seen as particularly appealing precisely
[because cyber operations are not kinetic]{.underline} and, therefore,
less dangerous than other military moves. But this could have the
[**inverse effect of making nuclear escalation**, rather than
deterrence, **more likely**, for the following reasons]{.underline}. 

In 2020, [**Russia** clarified its **nuclear declaratory
policy**]{.underline} to state that Russia reserves the right [to use
nuclear weapons under]{.underline} a range of contingencies, including
[an adversary attack against]{.underline} "[critical governmental or
military sites]{.underline} of the Russian Federation, disruption of
which would undermine nuclear forces' response actions." Cynthia Roberts
has suggested that this particular scenario "[likely **include\[s\]
cyber attacks** against command and control infrastructure]{.underline}
and/or attempted leadership decapitation." Similarly, Dmitry Stefanovich
wrote that "\[t\]here is a [wide consensus]{.underline} within the
Russian expert community that [this also includes possible cyber threats
as well as other non-nuclear dangers]{.underline}." Interestingly,
Russia's declaratory policy contains parallels to the implicit link
between cyber attacks and nuclear use contained in the 2018 U.S. Nuclear
Posture Review. That document notes that the United States would
consider using nuclear weapons under "extreme circumstances," including
"significant non-nuclear strategic attacks ... \[such as\] attacks on
U.S. or allied nuclear forces, their command and control, or warning and
attack assessment capabilities." 

Therefore, [a hypothetical attempt by the United States to conduct a
**cyber operation against Russian nuclear** command, control, and
communication **systems** for signaling purposes]{.underline}, such as
to demonstrate resolve or convey a desire to deter the use of nuclear
weapons [could in practice **make their use more likely**]{.underline}.
Unlike most cyber operations, which rely on secrecy, signals are meant
to be seen. And to be sufficiently credible, this kind of cyber
operation would have to demonstrate an ability to cause a meaningful
effect against Russia's nuclear systems, rather than a low-cost,
unsophisticated cyber operation. Therefore, assuming such an attack were
feasible, the [chances are greater in this scenario that Russia could
interpret U.S. cyber signals]{.underline} [as an attack against its
critical military systems]{.underline}. 

The problem is that, more often than not, [**cyber operations** **are**
**ambiguous** signals]{.underline}. There is evidence that states can
use cyber operations under some (narrow) conditions to signal a desire
to de-escalate international crises. But these findings do not extend
well to nuclear crises where clarity, rather than uncertainty, is
important for stability. The [use of cyber operations to defuse crises
have]{.underline} [involved cyber signaling short of war, not during an
ongoing conventional conflict involving nuclear]{.underline}
[powers]{.underline}. And they have [not involved cyber operations
targeting a state's nuclear command]{.underline} and control [where
states, like Russia, have already staked out]{.underline} [declaratory
policies]{.underline}. Moreover, states are still at a nascent stage in
developing shared indices to inform assessments of intent in cyberspace,
especially when it comes to cyber operations in nuclear crises. 

Therefore, even if [Russia]{.underline} would not take the cataclysmic
step of escalating to the first use of nuclear weapons in response to a
U.S. cyber operation, it [**could misinterpret U.S. signaling** efforts
**and** **take** **measures to make nuclear use easier**]{.underline}
(such as making warheads operational, dispersing forces, pre-delegating
authority, or increasing automaticity). These readiness measures could
[**increase the chances of** inadvertent or even accidental
**escalation**]{.underline}. 

The Biden administration has been commendable in clearly and
consistently communicating to Russia, and other audiences, what the
United States will not do in the Ukraine crisis --- like sending
American forces to Ukraine or establishing a no-fly zone. In addition,
the [administration should be equally clear about what is off the table
in cyberspace]{.underline} --- what Jacquelyn Schneider has termed a
"[strategic no-first-use" policy in cyberspace]{.underline}.
Specifically, the [**United States should** unequivocally **convey** to
Russia **that it will refrain** from]{.underline} taking **[actions in
cyberspace]{.underline}** during this crisis [that would undermine
nuclear stability]{.underline}, such as conducting disruptive
cyber-attacks against early warning satellites. This is
[different]{.underline} --- the opposite, in fact --- [from drawing "red
lines" in cyberspace]{.underline}, which are meant to deter unwanted
behavior but can often backfire. Instead, the United States should
communicate where it will exhibit restraint in cyber operations --- a
form of confidence-building. This could be conveyed publicly through
statements by administration officials, similar to statements that Biden
has made about other aspects of America's role in Ukraine. It could also
be privately communicated through ongoing backchannels taking place
between U.S. allies, like France, and Russia. 

There are also policy implications beyond the Ukraine conflict,
especially in an environment in which the United States confronts
potential future crises with other nuclear powers. In particular, senior
national security officials have repeatedly emphasized that China
represents a "pacing challenge" for the United States, including across
the nuclear and cyber realms. In fact, Gen. Nakasone recently announced
the creation of a China Outcomes Group under Cyber Command and the NSA.
And researchers have identified how hypothetical [crises involving the
United States and China could escalate along dangerous
trajectories]{.underline}, including to the use of nuclear weapons. The
[consequences of misunderstanding the utility of cyber signaling in this
area are significant.]{.underline} Therefore, policymakers must consider
how to improve civil-military coordination and cohesion so that the
employment of military cyber power --- especially when used against
sensitive adversary systems, particularly nuclear ones, during delicate
periods --- is not out of sync with strategic objectives. The United
States should also develop a more robust effort to clarify to
adversaries, including China, how it will constrain its own behavior in
cyberspace specifically during nuclear crises. The **[potential
implications of misperceptions surrounding cyber operations targeting
nuclear systems during a future crisis with a nuclear-armed adversary
are simply too significant.]{.underline}** 

#### Exposure of offensive capabilities causes more cyberwar 

Gil **Baram 18** (Gil Baram is the head of research at the Yuval
Nee\'man Workshop for Science, Technology and Security, and a research
fellow at the Blavatnik Interdisciplinary Cyber Research Center. "The
Theft and Reuse of Advanced Offensive Cyber Weapons Pose A Growing
Threat," 6/19/18,
https://www.cfr.org/blog/theft-and-reuse-advanced-offensive-cyber-weapons-pose-growing-threat) 

 

Almost exactly one year ago, the world experienced two destructive
cyberattacks in which offensive [**cyber tools** developed **by** the
National Security Agency]{.underline} (**[NSA]{.underline}**) **[were
stolen and shared with the public]{.underline}**. In May 2017, the
**[WannaCry]{.underline}** ransomware hit over 300,000 computers in 150
countries. One month later, the **[NotPetya]{.underline}** attack hit
the computer systems of companies and governmental entities across the
globe causing millions of dollars in damages. These attacks **[exploited
numerous vulnerabilities]{.underline}**, and have subsequently
**[exposed the slow response time of targeted countries]{.underline}**
and the lack of effective information sharing mechanisms between
responsible agencies, something which could have mitigated the severe
damage caused by the attacks. 

The interesting feature of these attacks is that [those
responsible---**North Korea and Russia**---**used the
leaked**]{.underline} [offensive **tools** originally developed by the
NSA]{.underline}. The investigation into WannaCry ultimately revealed
that the attackers had exploited a security vulnerability called
EternalBlue, originally developed by the NSA. NotPetya used a variant of
the same vulnerability, which is still wreaking havoc a year later. For
example, in February 2018, security researchers at Symantec reported
that an Iran-based hacking group had used EternalBlue as part of its
operations. 

This situation whereby technologically-advanced countries are
[**investing** efforts **in** developing **offensive cyber
capabilities**]{.underline} **[only to have these very tools stolen and
reused]{.underline}** raises three critical questions of urgent policy
relevance. 

First, are states going to start reusing each other's leaked cyber tools
as a matter of course? The [ability to reuse stolen cyber tools may
signal]{.underline} the beginning of a [shift in the distribution of
international cyber power]{.underline}, as weaker actors (including
non-state actors) become increasingly able to use sophisticated malware
to cause global damage and possibly target the cyber weapons' original
designers. Countries that are less technologically advanced and less
vulnerable to cyberattacks might find the reuse of stolen
vulnerabilities appealing for their own offensive activity. 

Second, is it possible to [prevent the leaking of cyber
tools]{.underline} from occurring in the first place? There [aren\'t
many reasons to be optimistic]{.underline}. First, there's the insider
threat problem---a particularly thorny issue given the extensive use of
contractors and the risk that they steal or mishandle sensitive
information that they were exposed to during their service. A second and
possibly more problematic reason is that it is cheaper to use stolen
vulnerabilities than finding new ones. As new vulnerabilities like
EternalBlue get exposed, the costs of using stolen cyber vulnerabilities
and conducting attacks are being consistently lowered while benefits
remain high. States with offensive capabilities know that putting their
hands on unique vulnerabilities developed by their adversaries will
**[enable them to more easily launch sophisticated
attacks]{.underline}** without the need pursue a lengthy and costly R&D
process. This makes the [**reuse of cyber tools especially appealing and
may motivate different actors**]{.underline} to concentrate their
efforts in this direction. As long as the benefits of using the stolen
vulnerabilities are higher than the costs, these vulnerabilities will
remain an attractive target. 

A third question for policymakers is whether the theft and reuse of
cyber vulnerabilities change the way states handle these
vulnerabilities. States should be aw[are of the risk that
vulnerabilities leak into the open]{.underline} and develop
information-sharing mechanisms to address it. These information sharing
mechanisms should exist between the intelligence agencies themselves and
between the intelligence community and the tech industry. Once it has
been recognized that a vulnerability, exploit or tool has been stolen,
the relevant agency should immediately share the specific data with all
the agencies and firms that might get affected by it, just like what the
NSA is believed to have done. To minimize security concerns and to not
expose sensitive sources and methods, there is no need to share the
precise reasons for giving such warnings. Yet it is crucial to share
this information in order to patch the vulnerabilities as soon as
possible and lower future risks. 

The U.S. government has its own vulnerabilities equities process (VEP)
policy which sets out how the U.S. government discloses computer
vulnerabilities it detects or acquires to other vendors. Countries
across Europe have their own similar VEP mechanism, and an EU-wide VEP
is being considered. But as [so many countries around the globe are
developing offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}, and in light
global damage costs of the WannaCry and NotPetya, there is an urgent
need to create an international mechanism for vulnerability disclosures
akin to a global VEP. 

Formulating an effective response to **[this growing type of cyber
weapon proliferation]{.underline}** is clearly the responsibility of
national governments. Quoting the words of Microsoft President Brad
Smith: "The governments of the world \[...\] need to take a different
approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons
in the physical world\... This is one reason we called for a new
\'Digital Geneva Convention\' to govern these issues, including a new
requirement for governments to report vulnerabilities to vendors, rather
than stockpile, sell, or exploit them..." [Alongside the development of
these offensive capabilities, and in light of the success of recent
attacks, **the theft and leak of offensive cyber weapons and their**
subsequent **use is only likely to** **increase, potentially creating
new international tensions** between governments and between them and
the tech industry]{.underline}.

#### OCOs perpetuate fear and suspicion -- inadvertent escalation 

**Valeriano** **and** **Jensen 19** (Brandon Valeriano is a senior
fellow at the Cato Institute. He is also the Bren Chair of Military
Innovation at the Marine Corps University and serves as senior adviser
for the Cyber Solarium Commission. Benjamin Jensen holds a dual

University, School of International Service. "The Myth of the Cyber
Offense: The Case for Restraint," 1/15/19,
https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/myth-cyber-offense-case-restraint) 

 

The **[Myth of the Offense]{.underline}** 

Contrary to observed patterns of limited disruption and espionage, Cyber
Command sees cyberspace as a domain fraught with increasing risk, where
great powers such as China and Russia will undermine American power. The
only solution, from this perspective, is to go on the offense. Yet, [the
benefits of an offensive posture, especially in cyberspace, are mostly
illusory to date]{.underline}. Instead, the [cyber domain]{.underline}
[tends to be optimized for defense and deception]{.underline}, not
decisive offensive blows. Not only is [**offense** likely the weaker
form of competition in cyberspace,]{.underline} it also **[risks
inadvertent escalation]{.underline}**. The **[fear, suspicion, and
misperception]{.underline}** that characterize interstate rivalries
[**exacerbate the risk of offensive action** in
cyberspace]{.underline}. 

Cyber Command's 2018 persistent-action strategy aims to "[expose
adversaries' weaknesses, learn their intentions and capabilities, and
counter attacks close to their origins]{.underline}."44 Put in simple
terms, the best defense is a good offense: get on adversary networks and
stop cyber operations targeting the United States before they occur.
Under this strategy, offensive cyber operations will also be
[preemptive]{.underline} in that they are designed to "[contest
dangerous adversary activity before it impairs \[U.S.\] national
power]{.underline}."45 To use another sports metaphor, come out
swinging. Go on the offense first and establish escalation dominance
(that is, demonstrating such superior capabilities over the target state
that it can't afford to escalate in response).46 

According to Cyber Command, preemptive strikes will "impose . . .
strategic costs on our adversaries, compelling them to shift resources
to defense and reduce attacks."47 Whether through punishment, risk, or
denial strategies, offensive actions theoretically alter the target's
behavior by increasing the expected costs of targeting U.S. interests.48
Offensive action, according to this thinking, deters future aggression
by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance. Yet, there
are [well-established reasons to doubt that offensive options produce
the intended results in cyberspace]{.underline}. 

Defense and Deception 

The [rationale behind persistent action---that the best defense is a
good offense---is deeply flawed]{.underline}. In fact, most military and
strategic theory holds that the defense is the superior posture.49 For
example, Sun Tzu describes controlling an adversary to make their
actions more predictable, and hence easy to undermine, by baiting them
to attack strong points.50 The stronger form of war is a
deception-driven defense: confusing an attacker so that they waste
resources attacking strong points that appear weak. This parallels
cybersecurity scholars Erik Gartzke and Jon Lindsay's claim that
[cyberspace is not offense dominant, but deception
dominant]{.underline}.51 Rather than persistent action and preemptive
strikes on adversary networks, the [United States needs persistent
deception and defensive counterstrikes optimized to undermine adversary
planning and capabilities]{.underline}. 

Fear and the Security Dilemma 

New policy options proposed by Cyber Command and the Trump
administration risk exacerbating [**fear** in other countries and
creating **a self-reinforcing spiral of tit-for-tat escalations that
risk war** even though each actor feels he is acting
defensively]{.underline}---or, as it is called in the scholarly
literature, [a **security dilemma**]{.underline}.52 As shown above, most
cyber operations to date have not resulted in escalation. The cyber
domain has been a world of spies collecting valuable information and
engaging in limited disruptions that substitute for, as well as
complement, more conventional options. [Shifting to a policy of
preemptive offensive cyber warfare **risks provoking fear and
overreaction** in other states and possibly **producing conflict
spirals**. Even limited-objective cyber offensive action]{.underline}
defined as "defending forward" [can be **misinterpreted** and lead to
**inadvertent escalation**]{.underline}.53 As the historian Cathal Nolan
puts it, "intrusions into a state's strategically important networks
pose serious risks and are therefore inherently threatening."54 

More worryingly, with a more offensive posture, it will be [increasingly
**difficult for states to differentiate** between cyber espionage and
more damaging degradation operations]{.underline}.55 What the United
States calls [defending forward,]{.underline} China and Russia will call
[preemptive strikes]{.underline}. Worse still, this posture will [likely
**lead great powers to assume** **all network** **intrusions**,
including espionage, **are preparing** the environment **for follow-on
offensive strikes**.]{.underline} According to cybersecurity scholar Ben
Buchanan, "in the \[aggressor\] state's own view, such moves are clearly
defensive, merely ensuring that its military will have the strength and
flexibility to meet whatever comes its way. Yet potential adversaries
are unlikely to share this perspective."56 The new strategy [risks
producing a "**forever cyber** **war**"]{.underline} prone to
inadvertent escalation because it implies all cyber operations should be
interpreted as escalatory by adversaries.57 

 

### US OCO's Bad 

#### Increased US cyber operations provokes prolif of OCOs -- destroys norms and incites adversaries 

**Lin and Smeets 18** (Dr. Herb Lin is senior research scholar for cyber
policy and security at the Center for International Security and
Cooperation and Hank J. Holland Fellow in Cyber Policy and Security at

Defend Forward," November 28, 2018,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/outcome-based-analysis-us-cyber-strategy-persistence-defend-forward)
//NB

One path towards escalation involves **[adversaries becoming more
aggressive]{.underline}** and conducting attacks that are [highly
disruptive to society]{.underline}---in other words, adversary activity
leads to a less stable cyberspace. This could be the result of either an
adversary's increased willingness to conduct attacks using existing
capacities or increased capacities of the adversary. Indeed, with
respect to the latter, the [U.S. vision]{.underline}---and associated
changed course of action---[may **encourage** other actors
to]{.underline} grow their budgets to [conduct **offensive cyber
operations**]{.underline}. The **[proliferation]{.underline}**
literature [on **weapons of mass destruction**]{.underline} has
extensively covered the role of special interests in [stimulating demand
for **weapon development**.]{.underline} This makes it a strong
possibility that the new U.S. vision can be used by those groups within
a given country favoring a growing cyber command to [justify and lobby
for **increased military spending**.]{.underline}

A second possibility is that [increased U.S. offensive cyber
activity]{.underline} that operates below the threshold of armed attack
activity [**reduces the value of cyber norms** of behavior that support
a **more stable cyberspace**.]{.underline} Even today, some observers
believe that the high level of offensive activity in cyberspace today
demonstrates quite forcefully that nations find value in conducting such
activity, and that such [activity points to the difficulty of
establishing a **more peaceful cyber norms regime**]{.underline}. These
observers argue that there is no reason to expect that increasing the
U.S. contribution to such activity worldwide will make it easier to
establish such a regime. Finally, a third possibility is that [increased
U.S. offensive cyber activity will **complicate diplomatic relations
with allies** and other nations whose cyber infrastructures are used in
support of such activity.]{.underline}

**[Increased aggressiveness by adversaries]{.underline}** could also
result [from growing incentives to conduct]{.underline} [offensive cyber
operations]{.underline} of a highly disruptive nature. In this case,
[**heightened** aggressiveness might be **a symptom of the U.S.
strategy**]{.underline} actually being effective in making the U.S. more
powerful. Consider, for example, the current [war against the Islamic
State]{.underline}: losing territory and grip in the Middle East, the
terrorist organization is said to be keen to recruit followers in Europe
and other places in the world to conduct attacks outside of Iraq and
Syria. These attempted mass killings are a way to show that the group
still needs to be feared and potentially to help recruiting---but they
do not change the balance of power in the region. [Actors in cyberspace
might become more **noisy and aggressive purely to increase friction,
gain attention** and so on]{.underline} ---and perhaps also [to
**influence international public opinion** in ways that drive the United
States toward changing its strategy]{.underline}.

Finally, worst-case outcomes---that is, a [United States that is less
powerful in cyberspace]{.underline} along w,ith a less stable
cyberspace---[could stem from a multitude of sources]{.underline}. One
possibility is that [the United States could **overplay its hand in
terms of cyber capabilities**]{.underline}. The USCYBERCOM is operating
in a space in which it has to seize the initiative against a large and
ever-growing number of actors. The dangers of fighting on multiple
fronts---even for the most capable actors---are well known from
conventional warfare. As the [number of potential cyber "fronts" is much
higher compared to conventional warfare, the **risks of overextension**
have become much higher as well]{.underline}. The Defense Department
vision's explicit focus on Russia and China, following the USCYBERCOM
vision's silence on the issue of priorities, makes us less concerned
about this scenario ---though it is still a possibility.

### Nato OCO's Bad 

####  Addition of OCOs into frameworks like NATO risks misinterpretation and escalation

**Long 17** (Austin Long is a Research Scholar at the Arnold A. Saltzman
Institute of War and Peace Studies and the Harriman Institute for
Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies at Columbia University. "A
cyber SIOP? Operational considerations for strategic offensive cyber
planning" in Journal of Cybersecurity, 18 February 2017,
https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/3/1/19/3003367) //NB

For a cyber-equivalent to the SIOP (i.e. a plan for strategic OCO),
planners need similar objectives. [Deterrence is an obvious
parallel]{.underline} [objective]{.underline} between nuclear and cyber
[but **deterrence of wha**t]{.underline}? During the Cold War strategic
nuclear forces were intended to deter both nuclear and conventional
attacks, while more recently unclassified guidance "directs DOD to
strengthen non-nuclear capabilities and reduce the role of nuclear
weapons in deterring non-nuclear attacks" \[17\]. [Are **strategic OCO**
intended primarily to deter adversary **OCO or** are such operations
**part of a broader set of deterrent capabilities, including nuclear
forces?**]{.underline} The latter seems more likely but this is a policy
choice different administrations may answer differently.

If deterrence fails, [OCO planners need **subsequent
objectives**]{.underline}. Here the parallel with nuclear operations, at
least those from the Cold War context, may be less obvious. Is the next
objective for strategic OCO the control of escalation? It could be but
this might vary by adversary and scenario. [Failure of deterrence
regarding a great power like Russia or China might lead to a
**subsequent objective of escalation** control but North Korea or Iran
might be different]{.underline}, with the objective being the prompt
neutralization of adversary strategic capabilities in order to limit (or
eliminate) damage from enemy attack.

[OCO could be a component of either objective]{.underline}, but would be
planned very differently. For escalation control, planners would need to
define targets that punish the adversary and/or deny objectives in order
to demonstrate US resolve. Yet the targets would have to be of a nature
unlikely to lead to further escalation by the adversary. [The **need to
strike this balance** -- producing effects **sufficient to show resolve
without risking escalation** -- will be challenging to policymakers and
planners alike. **Inadvertent escalation was a major worry in** the late
**Cold War** with conventional and nuclear forces -- a **concern that is
now returning in** East Asia and potentially the eastern and southern
flank of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (**NATO**)]{.underline}
\[18--21\]. [The **addition of OCO** further **compounds this problem**
by **creating new pathways to inadvertent escalation.**]{.underline}

A historical parallel to OCO and inadvertent escalation was the concern
about the impact of electronic warfare (EW) in a conventional battle in
Europe on Soviet early warning of a US strategic nuclear attack,
particularly one directed at the Soviet strategic nuclear arsenal
\[18\]. EW in this context was not intended to threaten Soviet strategic
forces, but could nonetheless generate pressure for Soviet nuclear use
as they became fearful their forces were vulnerable.

Soviet exercises reflected this fear. In a 1984 Soviet strategic
exercise, US bombers exploited damage to Soviet air defense as well as
the massive volume of electronic warfare to strike key Soviet command
centers. This initial attack was promptly followed by a devastating
attack on Soviet strategic nuclear forces \[22\]. Thus conventional air
operations, including electronic warfare, in an actual war may have made
the Soviets extremely concerned about the survival of their nuclear
forces and thus potentially pressured them to use nuclear weapons first.

[Strategic OCO could create similar fears, as attacks on even
nonmilitarily critical systems]{.underline} (e.g. power supplies) [could
**impact military capabilities** or stoke fears that military networks
had likewise been compromised]{.underline}. Indeed, [OCO effects could
be **more escalatory than traditional electronic warfare**]{.underline},
which even if it compromises air defense is nonetheless generally
observable -- radar operators will often know they are being jammed even
if they can do nothing about it. OCO, if done well, could compromise
systems without the target knowing. An adversary thus might not be able
to distinguish between a system failure due to OCO and a natural system
failure. In a crisis or conventional war, if some component of an
adversary's command and control failed it could easily be
**[misinterpreted as successful OCO]{.underline}**, creating [escalatory
pressures]{.underline}. [Targeting strategic OCO for escalation control
**without risking inadvertent escalation may thus be a major planning
challenge.**]{.underline}

### Integration Bad 

#### Integration of OCOs magnifies the risk of confliction among NATO members 

Jeppe T **Jacobsen 21** (Jeppe T. Jacobsen is a Ph.D. candidate at the
Danish Institute for International Studies and the Center for War
Studies at the University of Southern Denmark. "Offensive Cyber
Capabilities and State Violence: Three Logics of Integration,"
10/26/21  

https://academic.oup.com/jogss/article/7/1/ogab028/6412386) 

Confliction---the [issue of secrecy]{.underline} 

The third [challenge to the integration of cyber effects]{.underline} in
NATO operations [relates]{.underline} [to]{.underline} a well-known
military concept, [deconfliction]{.underline}. The coordination by
allies and military units of their efforts to avoid confliction, between
for example an air operation and a special forces operation in the same
area, is a central element in every military campaign. Deconfl[iction is
all about openness and communication between allied
partners.]{.underline} But [in cyberspace, **deconfliction comes with
several difficulties**]{.underline}. At the core of these difficulties
is the fact that the tools and techniques that produce **[cyber
effects]{.underline}**---which are often also used and heavily depended
on for intelligence collection---[**are developed in secret** and must
stay secret until the effect is achieved]{.underline}. [If]{.underline}
the IT **[vulnerabilities and exploits are known]{.underline}**, vendors
or [**adversaries can** fix or replace the software and
thereby]{.underline} [**render the effect impossible** to
achieve]{.underline}.39 [In an **alliance not known for sufficient
mutual trust** among members to share intelligence]{.underline},40 there
is [**little indication that allies will** **become** more **open**
about the cyber tools and techniques they currently have at their
disposal.]{.underline} The request-based model is the result of that
lack of trust. And the [**unwillingness to share** cyber intelligence
**seriously challenges NATO's ambition**]{.underline} to use CYOC [to
facilitate information-sharing]{.underline} to increase situational
awareness and thereby achieve the 'cyber readiness' and 'cyber
resiliency' that NATO Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoană hopes to
attain.41 

Furthermore, lack of coordination and discussion about the use of
military cyber capabilities, both internally in each state and among
allies, can have negative implications for intelligence activities and
general network security. A conventional military decision to deliver
cyber effects is rarely concerned with maintaining access and staying
secret after an effect is achieved. Even though it is customary to try
to obscure the vulnerabilities that are being exploited, it is difficult
to ensure that those operating the targeted system or third-party
network analysts do not identify and fix the vulnerabilities in, for
example, commercial products used all over the world. Thus, military
[**plans to engage other** state **entities** need to weigh the
benefit]{.underline} [of]{.underline} delivering [cyber effects against
the **risk of losing intelligence capacity**]{.underline}, as well as
the [risk **that other actors** (allies, corporations, adversaries,
criminals, etc.) **will use the same exploits against
oneself**]{.underline}. In other words, there is a **[conflict of
interest]{.underline}** between attack, intelligence collection and
internal defence **[in each NATO member state]{.underline}**.42 The
desire of the US Cyber Command to become more independent from the
National Security Agency (NSA) is precisely an attempt to gain a
stronger voice when the US government assesses whether a vulnerability
should be disclosed to vendors, retained for intelligence purposes or
used to deliver 'loud' cyber effects.43   

The [**risk of confliction** among allies arises]{.underline} from the
fact that a [similar assessment procedure does not exist across
NATO]{.underline}. As conversations with several national
representatives at the CDC reveal, such a procedure is unlikely to be
agreed upon owing to the different perspectives on offence, defence and
espionage in cyberspace currently prevailing among member states.44 If
the Netherlands, for example, offers to [deliver a 'loud' cyber effect
in a NATO operation]{.underline}, British or American intelligence
[operations]{.underline} could end up being disturbed because they rely
on the same vulnerabilities which---when used in military
operations---[risk being exposed and subsequently fixed]{.underline}.45
[When deploying 'loud' cyber effects]{.underline}, [malicious
actors]{.underline} such as criminals are also given the [**opportunity
to identify and exploit the same vulnerabilities** in unpatched systems
**in allied countries**]{.underline}. The ransomware [incidents known as
WannaCry and NotPetya]{.underline} are [examples of the damage that can
emerge from government exploits becoming publicly
available]{.underline}---even though the specific vulnerabilities were
already patched by Microsoft and updates released to supported
systems.46 

In short, there is a dilemma both internally, between intelligence
agencies and the military, and externally, between allies. While it is
difficult to do much about the latter, the [internal power
dynamics]{.underline} in most states, with the intelligence agencies as
the primary cyber actors, [are likely to **limit the willingness of**
most **states** **to deliver military cyber
effects**]{.underline}---whether offensive or defensive---when CYOC
makes requests. They also [limit the willingness to share cyber threat
information]{.underline} across the alliance through CYOC. 

#### \[\]\[\[Sharing OCOs within NATO undermines cyber norms -- increases risk of escalation

One way to explain this is through the [**existence and dominance of** a
largely unspoken but **widely accepted norm**]{.underline}. For decades,
the [predominant actors in]{.underline} cyberspace [have been
intelligence agencies]{.underline}; and the norms that characterize
interactions between intelligence agencies are not primarily concerned
with military concepts such as conflict escalation and deterrence.67 In
the world of intelligence agencies, success is not about keeping a
distance between oneself and the adversary by signalling one's
intentions and capabilities. It is about being able to outmanoeuvre
adversaries in a space of constant contact.68 There are always risks,
and the work usually takes place in legal grey zones where a clear
distinction between war and peace is not the guiding principle. This is
an arena where the opportunity to annoy, cheat and delay opponents is
taken when it arises. In short, [**espionage and counter**-**espionage
do not fit well with** the thorough military operational planning that
characterizes **NATO operations**. Intelligence operations]{.underline},
on the other hand, [fit perfectly with a dynamic cyberspace where
anonymity is easy to achieve and uncertainty a constant
condition]{.underline}.69 The states that embrace cyberspace as a domain
where the intelligence norm dominates are able to use a broader array of
tools to pursue or respond to various foreign political objectives than
only those that relate to military operations. 

In its 2018 'vision', the US Cyber Command built implicitly on the
dominant intelligence norm. Here, the objective is to become more agile
and act as close to the adversary as possible ('defend forward').70 The
United States considers 'constant contact' and 'persistent engagement'
as the necessary guiding principles to achieve superiority in cyberspace
and to take full advantage of the broader potential for pursuing its
political objectives through cyberspace. During the 2018 US midterm
elections, for example, the US Cyber Command worked closely with the NSA
to disrupt servers operated by the Russian Internet Research Agency
aiming to spread fake news and stir up tension in the United States.71
More recently, the US Cyber Command responded with various cyber effects
against Iran after the Iranian Revolutionary Guards apparently placed
mines on ships in the Strait of Hormuz.72 These practices illustrate
that, for the United States, cyber effects provide political options
when one does not want to escalate existing tensions into military
confrontation. Defensive coordination between allies through CYOC
supports such defensive use of cyber effects, increasing the possibility
that US Cyber Command will be allowed to 'defend forward' and work
persistently through allied networks.73 [A **more cyber-active NATO**,
however, **risks being counterproductive** to the ambition to 'defend
forward' through allied networks]{.underline}. 

**[Unintended conflict escalation]{.underline}** from ongoing cyber
activity [is mainly a risk if]{.underline} military analysts---in a
strategic environment with heightened attention to military
confrontation---[ignore the **dominant intelligence norm**]{.underline}.
If that happens, it becomes more likely that '[persistent engagement'
and active cyber defence will be **misinterpreted as military
preparation**]{.underline}, armament or the initial phase of an attack.
**[If NATO]{.underline}**, an organization that has publicly returned to
its original raison d'être of deterrence and collective defence,
[becomes the entity that **coordinates cyber effects**]{.underline}
below the threshold of armed conflict, [then the **likelihood increases
that Russia misinterprets** these effects **as escalatory**]{.underline}
and acts accordingly. In other words, [**a more active NATO** in the
current strategic environment **increases the risk that the existing
intelligence norm will be undermined and replaced by a more militarized
norm**.]{.underline} 

 

Intelligence norm -- shared assumption that cyberspace is for espionage
-- not for being aggressive -- when you observe espionage means you do
not escalate in an aggressive way 

 

#### Relying on offense in cyberspace erodes cyber norms 

Mariarosaria **Taddeo 19** (Fellow in Cyber Security and Ethics in the
Department of Politics and International Studies at the University of
Warwick and Research Associate at the Uehiro Centre for Practical
Ethics, University of Oxford, UK, "Norms and Strategies for Stability in
Cyberspace," Chapter 3 in "The 2019 Yearbook of the Digital Ethics Lab,"

<https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29145-7_3>) 

In this scenario, state actors make policy decisions to protect their
abilities to launch cyber attacks. [Strategic ambiguity]{.underline} is
one of these decisions. According to this policy, states decide neit[her
to define and nor inform the international community about their red
lines]{.underline}---thresholds that once crossed would trigger state
response---for non-kinetic cyber7 attacks (Mariarosaria Taddeo 2011).
This approach leaves de facto unregulated cyber attacks that remain
below the threshold of an armed attack. 

Strategic ambiguity has often been presented as a way to confuse the
opponents about the consequences of their cyber attacks. As the US
National Intelligence Officer for Cyber Issues officer put it: 

> Currently most countries, including ours, don't want to be incredibly
> specific about the red lines for two reasons: You don't want to invite
> people to do anything they want below that red line thinking they'll
> be able to do it with impunity, and secondly, you don't want to back
> yourself into a strategic corner where you have to respond if they do
> something above that red line or else lose credibility in a
> geopolitical sense.7  

However, by fostering ambiguity, state actors also leave open for
themselves a wider room for manoeuvring. [**Strategic ambiguity** allows
**state** actors **to deploy cyber attacks for military, espionage,
sabotage, and surveillance** purposes without being constrained by their
own policies or international red lines.]{.underline} This makes
ambiguity a dangerous choice, one that is [strategically risky and
politically misleading]{.underline}. 

The risks come with the [cascade effect following the **absence of clear
thresholds for cyber attacks**]{.underline}. The [lack of
thresholds]{.underline} **[facilitates a proliferation of offensive
strategies]{.underline}**. This, in turn, [**favours an international
cyber arms race** and the **weaponization of cyberspace**, which
ultimately **spurs the escalation of cyber attacks**]{.underline}. This
is why [strategic ambiguity]{.underline} is a [policy hazard that
fuels]{.underline}, rather than arrest, [escalation of interstate cyber
attacks]{.underline}. Cyber attacks would be [**deterred more
effectively by a regime of international norms** **that makes attacks
politically costly**]{.underline} to the point of being disadvantageous
for the state actors who launch them.

Early internet pioneers, including John Perry Barlow, regarded
cyberspace as a virtual environment not requiring formal rules or
external controls (Barlow 1996). [However, growing numbers of cyber
security events affecting private as well as public information and
communication technologies (ICTs) have undermined these
non-interventionist positions. Over the course of the past two decades,
voluntary norms of responsible behavior "have emerged along with
confidence- and capacity-building measures as the principal policy tools
of choice to meet the \[...\] vision of an open, secure, accessible, and
peaceful ICT environment" (Kavanagh 2017: 10).]{.underline}

[Defined as shared expectations of appropriate behavior, norms can be of
regulative (i.e. describing obligations, prohibitions and permissions)
or constitutive (i.e. creating categories of actors and actions) nature
(Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Wiener 2017; Björkdahl 2002). "By shaping
agents' understandings of their social environments, associated
interactions, and possible outcomes", they foster coordination and
predictability, and in turn reduce contextual ambiguities to manageable
levels (Ferguson 2019: 1). In contrast to formal legal provisions, norms
rely on softer means of enforcement and implementation.]{.underline}

According to Finnemore, the move to voluntary cyber security norms can
partly be attributed to concerns about the suitability and effectiveness
of binding treaties in fast-moving environments, as well as to fears of
legal lock-in among leading cyber powers (Finnemore 2017: 3). Abbot and
Snidal have argued that when circumstances are fundamentally uncertain,
that is, when even the range and/or distribution of possible outcomes is
unknown, \[formal legal agreements\] may not be desirable. In
particular, if actors are ambiguity-averse, they will prefer to leave
agreements imprecise rather than face the possibility of being caught in
unfavorable commitments. (Abbott and Snidal 2000: 442) [Despite
perceived needs to reduce threats and corresponding levels of
uncertainty, and more than two decades of concerted diplomatic efforts
relating to the formulation of norms of responsible behavior for the
digital domain, advancement has been slow and political compromise
short-lived. In the wake of political contentions among governments
surrounding debates about existing and emerging perils emanating from
the digital realm and possible normative measures to address them, a
number of non-state actors have stepped up and started to more actively
make their voices heard]{.underline} (Grigsby 2017; Mačák 2017;
Väljataga 2017).

[International relations and international law literatures have taken
note of the rise of private actors involved in global steering and
rule-making processes, and have systematized and subsumed ideational
efforts conducted by non-state actors under the umbrella of
norm-entrepreneurship or soft-law, respectively (Finnemore and Sikkink
1998; Risse-Kappen, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999; Abbott and Snidal 2000).
Norm entrepreneurs (or protagonists of soft-law instruments) challenge
prevailing patterns of behavior, by suggesting normative ideas and
mobilizing like-minded stakeholders or networks within and across states
to endorse them (Sandholtz 2017: 2). "These alliances \[then\] bring
pressure to bear from above (transnationally) and below (domestically)",
and help the standards proposed get more widely accepted (Sandholtz
2017: 2).]{.underline}

In order to reap the benefits of these fragmented processes, however,
initiators need to deliberately plan for "complementarity" and
"cross-pollination". The next section summarizes leading norms-based
efforts launched by Microsoft, Siemens, Telefónica, and Kaspersky Lab,
and assesses the effectiveness of their activities along three
dimensions: Output, outcome, and impact. Analyzing the effects of
regulatory efforts has remained extremely challenging and has incited
numerous scholarly debates. There are no unified approaches for
assessing the success of norms or regimes. This chapter draws on the
work conducted by Flohr et al. and Wolf who have proposed assessments
along the dimensions mentioned above (Flohr et al. 2010; Wolf 2010).
Only proposals with explicit normative nexus and only proposals launched
post-2017 were selected for analysis.

Private cyber security norm development efforts

Non-state actors, in particular technology companies, have been key
contributors to the development and expansion of cyberspace.4 [As
operators of network infrastructures, designers of products, and
suppliers of services, they have made important contributions to the
"international \[...\] architecture for the governance of cyberspace"
(Radu 2014: 4). In addition to producing hard- and software, they have
come to contribute to the promotion of global cyber security norms and
standards.]{.underline} So far, their normative contributions have
received little academic attention. [This chapter seeks to contribute to
richer understandings of the normative parts played by technology
companies and unveil the governing qualities of their activities by
evaluating them across the dimensions of output, outcome, and
impact.5]{.underline}

[As key providers of ICTs, technology companies have strong incentives
to pursue normative strategies to sustain their business models. Through
the eyes of technology companies, norms provide useful tools for
tackling contextual ambiguities and pre-empt costly changes to legal
frameworks, or governmentled market interventions. While the reasons for
corporate norm-shaping efforts pertaining to the virtual realm may
primarily be grounded in commercial considerations, i.e. reducing costs
and risks, securing their operations, gaining access to new
markets/safeguarding existing customer bases, and strengthening
corporate reputation and legitimacy, less self-serving reasons, i.e.
upholding good-faithcommitments and values such as user privacy, should
not be forgotten]{.underline} (Gorwa and Peez 2018). Not all of the
activities undertaken by technology companies in the context of norms of
responsible behavior for cyberspace can be explained by rationalist
arguments.

Microsoft

One of the first corporate entities to engage in debates about
responsible conduct in cyberspace was Microsoft (Microsoft Security
Response Center 2010). Valued at over USD 1 trillion (2019), the company
ranks among the four largest technology giants globally, the other three
being Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon[. Following prior norms-oriented
ventures between 2013 and 2016, in February 2017, Microsoft President
and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith introduced the idea of a Digital
Geneva Convention to Protect Cyberspace (Microsoft 2013; McKay et al.
2014; Charney et al. 2016; Smith 2017). Grounded in the belief that
deeprooted collaboration among states, and between states, the private
sector, and civil society is needed to curb nefarious doings in the
digital realm, the convention as outlined by Smith, asks governments,
among other things, to:]{.underline}

[Refrain from attacking critical infrastructures (including civil and
financial systems)]{.underline}

[· Abstain from engaging in espionage · Engage in vulnerabilities
disclosure processes]{.underline}

[· Exercise restraint in developing cyber weapons and engaging in
offensive activities, and]{.underline}

[· Assist private sector entities in securing cyberspace. (Microsoft
2017)]{.underline}

[It also calls on technology companies to behave as neutral actors and
recommends the setting up of an independent non-governmental
organization capable of investigating and publicly attributing
(nation-state) cyberattacks (Smith 2017; Maurer and Taylor 2018). Met
with little enthusiasm by governments, Microsoft's call for a Digital
Geneva Convention was succeeded by the unveiling of a Cybersecurity Tech
Accord bringing together "global technology companies committed to
protecting their customers and users", 14 months later]{.underline}

In September 2018, Microsoft unveiled a Digital Peace Now campaign,
which calls on citizens to protect cyberspace, e.g. through measures of
cyber hygiene, and urges governments to refrain from endangering the
global digital environment (Microsoft 2018). Only two months later,
Microsoft co-sponsored the Paris Call for Trust and Security in
Cyberspace. Introduced at the 12th Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in
Paris, the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace (short Paris
Call) constitutes one of the most widely endorsed multi-stakeholder
instruments pertaining to peace and security in the virtual realm to
date (Ministère de l'Europe et des Affaires Étrangères 2018)

The Paris Call proposes the development of common principles for
securing cyberspace through collaborative efforts across existing
international platforms and mechanisms (Ministère de l'Europe et des
Affaires Étrangères 2018). Although at first sight a French initiative,
the Paris Call was vitally influenced by Microsoft, both in terms of
origin and content. [According to information presented by Le Monde and
WIRED, it was Microsoft's political lobbying that gave rise to the
initiation of the Paris Call (Matsakis 2018a; Untersinger 2018). The
Paris Call advances nine principles intended to resonate with both state
and nonstate entities. Specifically, it asks supporters to:]{.underline}

[Prevent and recover from malicious cyber activities that threaten or
cause significant, indiscriminate or systemic harm to individuals and
critical infrastructure; • Prevent activity that intentionally and
substantially damages the general availability or integrity of the
public core of the Internet; • Strengthen our capacity to prevent malign
interference by foreign actors aimed at undermining electoral processes
through malicious cyber activities; • Prevent ICT-enabled theft of
intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential
business information, with the intent of providing competitive
advantages to companies or commercial sector; • Develop ways to prevent
the proliferation of malicious ICT tools and practices intended to cause
harm; • Strengthen the security of digital processes, products and
services, throughout their lifecycle and supply chain; Support efforts
to strengthen an advanced cyber hygiene for all actors; • Take steps to
prevent non-State actors, including the private sector, from
hacking-back, for their own purposes or those of other non-state actors;
• Promote the widespread acceptance and implementation of international
norms of responsible behavior as well as confidence-building measures in
cyberspace. (Ministère de l'Europe et des Affaires Étrangères
2018)]{.underline}

Rather than reinventing the wheel in terms of normative prescriptions,
the Paris Call constitutes an attempt at realigning scattered
discussions and improving the complementarity of cyber security norm
formation processes

[While the Paris Call has seen fairly broad uptake among governments,
private industry, the technical community, researchers, non-governmental
organizations, and civil society, there have been a number of notable
public abstentions, including the United States, Russia, China, Iran,
and Israel (Matsakis 2018b).]{.underline}

[Norms have played a large role in U.S. cyber strategies, dating back to
the 2011 International Cyberspace Strategy. Norms, or a standard of
appropriate behavior for actors with a given identity, often follow a
lifecycle in which they first emerge, then receive enough acceptance to
reach a tipping point for a norm cascade, and finally are internalized
in behaviors.]{.underline} Norm emergence, the first stage of the
lifecycle, advents with a norm entrepreneur who shepherds the idea and
attempts to convince others to adopt it. These norms entrepreneurs play
a critical role in framing the issues at hand. [Struggles over framing
have significant long-term consequences because the initial framing
tends to be sticky and difficult to dislodge.]{.underline} This
"stickiness" can create a first-mover advantage in struggles to frame
new norms. Beyond framing, norm entrepreneurs often create
organizational platforms from which they seek to promote and
institutionalize norms.

[Successful norm entrepreneurs diffuse their norm to a sufficient number
of actors to create a "norm cascade" in which the norm is adopted across
a plurality of pertinent actors.]{.underline} Scholars refer to this as
the tipping or threshold point for significant norm adoption. [Studies
of norm adoption suggest that the critical mass usually occurs when one
third of the relevant actors in the international system have adopted
the norm.]{.underline} In some cases, some actors or states are so
critical that a norm will not reach a tipping point without their
endorsement. Therefore, identifying these critical actors as part of a
norm diffusion strategy is essential to the successful development of
the norm through the full lifecycle. [The most mature norms are finally
internalized so that they are taken for granted as appropriate and
natural behaviors.]{.underline}

Not all norms complete the lifecycle, but some norms and norm
entrepreneurs are more likely to succeed. Research has found that the
norms that are most likely to be adopted are those that display the
following three characteristics: specificity (clarify a definition);
durability (length of time the norms have been in effect); and
concordance (extent of acceptance).

[During the Obama administration, the U.S. placed a strong emphasis on
norm entrepreneurship in cyberspace. In a 2015 speech by then Secretary
of State John Kerry, he articulated the United States' vision for
cyberspace norms, asserting that "the Internet should be open and
accessible to everyone," as well as " interoperable, so it can connect
seamlessly across international borders." Kerry went on to detail that
"people are entitled to the same rights of free expression online as
they possess offline" and that the U.S. expected states to uphold these
norms in cyberspace while deterring threats. Ultimately, Kerry argued
that these norms of appropriate behavior in cyberspace would lead to
economic growth, peace, and "a means for social empowerment that is also
the most democratic form of public expression ever
invented."]{.underline}

[Accordingly, the 2015 DoD cyber strategy called for the U.S. to "foster
norms of responsible behavior to improve global strategic stability" and
reiterated "The United States is committed to an open, secure,
interoperable, and reliable Internet that enables prosperity, public
safety, and the free flow of commerce and ideas." While norms played a
less central role in the 2018 DoD cyber strategy, the strategy continued
to call for an open, free, and interoperable Internet.]{.underline}

Perhaps more notably for norm evolution, the 2018 strategy (and the 2018
Command Vision for Cyber Command) articulated a new implicit norm: that
states could engage with each other in cyberspace, exchanging tit for
tat responses in cyberspace, without escalating retaliation to the level
of "armed conflict." [Specifically, the concept of persistent engagement
relies on establishing acceptable forms of "agreed competition" between
states in the cyber domain. The central premise is that, through a
process of "tacit bargaining," the U.S. can find consensus about
acceptable behavior in cyberspace. What follows from this logic is that
the cyber operations we observe states conducting should represent an
"agreed competition" short of war---though this agreement may not be
formally written down or accepted by states. Anything outside of the
scope of this agreed competitive space should therefore be where
interests diverge and where conflict can be anticipated.]{.underline}

But experts have raised the question of whether there are risks that how
the DoD operates as part of defend forward and persistent engagement may
be inadvertently undermining norms the U.S. seeks to promote. In
particular, if agreed competition is constructed from tacit bargaining
developed through iterative interactions over time, these agreements are
only implied. There is a risk, therefore, that what the U.S. assumes is
tacitly accepted by all parties is not, in fact, the case. A related
concern is a lack of clarity about how confidence building measures
(CBMs) could support the development of norms, particularly around
promoting the stability of cyberspace. Unlike arms control regimes, CBMs
are voluntary agreements that help promote transparency and clarity
around cyber operations and intent. Explicitly linking CBM efforts with
military cyber operations can not only promote stability, but also
provide a mechanism for more explicit communication (especially with
adversaries) about norms of appropriate behavior around offensive cyber
operations.

[Furthermore, the U.S. has agreed to international cyber norms through
formal processes, such as the UN Group of Government Experts. To make
meaningful progress on these, it is important to ensure that the words
of the U.S. government match its deeds in cyberspace, to include how the
DoD operates in and through the domain. Clarifying how the DoD restrains
its own behavior and operates in a way that is consistent with the norms
the U.S. seekstrying to promote will be essential for the diffusion of
norms in the international system. In this sense, the DoD has the
opportunity to act as a norm entrepreneur.]{.underline}

#### Established norms prevent large-scale attacks

Studies at the School of Law and Politics at the University of Hull.

3.4 The [Failure of Cyber Deterrence?]{.underline} 

The potency of cyber deterrence is difficult to judge. This is partly
because there exists [no consensus on what constitutes an act
of]{.underline} [sufficient cyber aggression]{.underline}. Therefore, it
is not entirely clear what is to be deterred. Where exactly the
threshold for response should be will be discussed in section three of
this paper. For now, we can state that [**low-level** nuisance
**attacks** are **a daily occurrence**]{.underline}. For example, U.S.
military networks are probed and scanned millions of times each day
(Work 2015, 1). Similarly, acts of cyber espionage are reasonably
common. However, [what is also evident is **the lack of major cyber
attacks**]{.underline}. For a while, Stuxnet, Wiper, Shamoon and Bronze
Soldier appeared to signal the rise of cyber attack as a potent new
instrument of policy. However, [**medium to large-scale attacks have**
**essentially dried-up**.]{.underline} Indeed, reflecting the empirical
evidence, and marking a shift in tone, in his September 2015 testimony
to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Director of National
Intelligence, James Clapper, talked down the possibility of an
'electronic Pearl Harbor'. Instead, he focused on ongoing
'low-to-moderate' level threats (Clapper 2015, 2). 

What does this all tell us? Is deterrence working? If one considers
low-to-moderate threats as deterrable, then the answer would seem to be
no. From this perspective, and according to some policy makers,
deterrence is already failing. In a 2015 Senate Armed Services Committee
Hearing, Chairman John McCain was scathing in his assessment: 'Our
adversaries view our response \... as timid and ineffectual. Put simply,
the problem is a lack of deterrence. The administration has not
demonstrated to our adversaries that the consequence of continued cyber
attacks against us outweigh the benefit.' (Takala 2015) However, if we
take the view that [**cyber deterrence should really concern itself only
with large-scale attacks**, the **picture** **is** more
**positive**]{.underline}. Indeed, Valeriano and Maness (2015) have
[identified **considerable levels of restraint in state cyber
behaviour**]{.underline}. This could be due to a [lack of confidence in
the strategic utility of cyber attack]{.underline}. It may also reflect
the [**development of norms against aggressive forms of cyber**
**behaviour**]{.underline} and the **[efficacy of
deterrence]{.underline}**. Indeed, [**norms** increasingly **form part
of 'complex deterrence'**, within which military and non-military
elements operate together]{.underline}. In cyberspace, although a
settled understanding of universal rules of behaviour is still lacking,
[**norms appear to be crystalising around acceptable forms of
intrusion** rather than a blanket non-use position]{.underline} (Stevens
2012, 25). This may explain the continuance of lowlevel probes whilst
large attacks have trailed off. 

#### NATO's cyber policy is rooted in defensive actions -- reluctance to discuss pre-emptive warfare within current cyber norms

**Saltzman 13** (Dr. Ilai Saltzman is the Israel Institute Visiting
Assistant Professor of Israel Studies at the University of Maryland and
previously served as a professor of government at Claremont McKenna
College where he taught classes in International Relations, Israeli
foreign and security policy as well as US foreign policy. "Cyber
Posturing and the Offense-Defense Balance," 11 March 2013,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13523260.2013.771031>)
//NB

Both agencies represent a [**highly defensive reaction** to NATO\'s
security challenges involving cyber warfare]{.underline}. As the
Bucharest summit declaration proclaimed, the official cyber policy '...
[**emphasizes the need** for]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} [and
nations **to protect** key]{.underline} [**information systems** in
accordance with their respective responsibilities; share best practices;
and provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to
counter a cyber attack'.]{.underline}109 Yet Russia\'s continued use of
cyber warfare during the war in Georgia highlighted its escalatory
nature and the possible negative implications on conventional military
conflicts. In April 2009, as part of the Declaration on Alliance
Security, NATO moved further to identify cyberattacks alongside
terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) as
the key global threats to member states and the international
community.110

But the [major breakthrough in NATO strategic thinking regarding cyber
warfare, which went beyond the strictly technical aspect of network
protection]{.underline}, occurred during mid 2010. A team of leading
experts in matters of security, headed by former American Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, was asked to prepare a preliminary report to
be used as a basis for NATO\'s new Strategic Concept. According to this
report, entitled NATO 2020: Assured Security; Dynamic Engagement and
submitted in May:

> The next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fibre
> \[sic\] optic cable. Already, cyber attacks against NATO systems occur
> frequently, but most often below the threshold of political concern.
> However, the risk of a large-scale attack on NATO\'s command and
> control systems or energy grids could readily warrant consultations
> under Article 4 and could possibly lead to collective defence measures
> under Article 5. [**Effective cyber defence requires the means to
> prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from
> attacks**.]{.underline}111

[Still, the recommendations **reflected the defensive posture** that was
already advocated]{.underline} [and implemented thus far by
NATO]{.underline}. Furthermore, and extremely relevant to the
Alliance\'s strategic planners, the Albright Commission was **[reluctant
to engage the question of whether cyberattacks against NATO member
states would constitute a direct act of aggression that would trigger
the collective security clause.]{.underline}** Instead, it defined a
rather ambiguous principle according to which such a decision must be
made considering '... the nature, source, scope, and other aspects of
the particular security challenge'.112 The same defensive reasoning can
be observed in the ensuing final version of the Strategic Concept
adopted at the Lisbon summit six months later. In the words of the
document, NATO will:

> develop further our ability to prevent, detect, defend against and
> recover from cyberattacks, including by using the NATO planning
> process to enhance and coordinate national cyber-defence capabilities,
> bringing all NATO bodies under centralized cyber protection, and
> better integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and response with
> member nations.113

[Yet again, the numerous **references to cyber warfare as a security
threat** **were extremely narrow** to include at best espionage,
hacking, or disruption and there was **no discussion about the
possibility to conduct pre-emptive or retaliatory cyber
warfare**]{.underline}.114 In fact, Stephane Abrial, commander of Allied
Command Transformation (ACT) responsible for leading the Alliance\'s
transformation of capabilities and forces, was against defining the
Strategic Concept\'s notion of 'in-depth cyberdefense' as a
'military-only, or even a military-centric, strategy'. Instead, Abrial
[**focuses on NATO\'s 'permanent mission** \[which\] involves
**countering** the daily **attempts made by hackers** to break into our
systems]{.underline}, which are by necessity interconnected, making a
weakness in one country\'s systems a weakness in all'.115 Other key NATO
officials, including General Secretary Anders Fogh Rasmussen,
**[continued to conceptualize cyber warfare in defensive
terms]{.underline}**, arguing that recent cyberattacks '... increased
the urgency to [strengthen cyber defences]{.underline} not only at NATO,
but across the Alliance as a whole'. There is [**no public discourse**
involving NATO officials that suggests treating cyber capabilities as an
offensive feature **of the Alliance\'s cyber strategy.**]{.underline}
The most proactive proposal to date was the option to dispatch NATO\'s
cyber Rapid Reaction Teams in order to assist member countries suffering
from cyberattacks, or 'incidents' as Rasmussen calls them, should they
ask for such assistance.116

It appears that [NATO is **focused on prevention of attacks** on its
institutional assets and member countries **rather than initiating
cyberattacks** against others.]{.underline} As the American
representative to the CCDCOE concluded, when it comes to NATO, its major
contribution to cyber defence will probably involve eroding the '...
hacker\'s greatest advantages -- anonymity'.117 NATO\'s strategic
thinking will continue to utilize its [pooled capabilities in order to
**promote defensive solutions** to cyber warfare of various kinds and it
will continue to **treat it as a threat rather than as an offensive
feature to be proactively utilized**.]{.underline}

Intelligence Sharing and Coordination 

There are also [benefits to **sharing threat intelligence** with
industry and **allies**]{.underline}. The United States operates a
global security network that [connects not just treaty allies but
businesses and civil society actors]{.underline}.79 Any cyber strategy
must [embrace this fact as a **source of strength**, not a point of
vulnerability]{.underline}. A greater number of actors identifying
adversary cyber operations provides [early warning indicators and
reveals adversary capabilities]{.underline}. 

To date, intelligence sharing associated with cyber operations has been
prone to interagency debate and coordination challenges. There are
organizational seams, such as the divide between the FBI and CIA before
the September 11th terrorist attacks, that often [limit intelligence
sharing and create barriers to effective response]{.underline} within
the federal government.80 This dilemma is compounded with [respect to
alliance partners and industry]{.underline}. States and many other
organizations tend to sto[vepipe information and undermine effective
coordination]{.underline} based on security risks. Yet, closing off
information in a network limits responsiveness. 

Rather than limit information sharing, [the United States should
reengage processes]{.underline} such as the Obama administration's
Vulnerabilities Equities Policy, [which sought **disclosures** of newly
discovered and unknown malware that might pose a global
threat]{.underline}.81 [**Sharing threat intelligence** is]{.underline}
central [to]{.underline} not just inter­agency coordination, but
[working]{.underline} **[with partner states]{.underline}**, businesses,
and civil society. In order to strengthen the defense of the network
through depth, the United States will need to assume risk in sharing
information, and hence lose some offensive options. This includes
working with nontraditional actors, such as the white hat hacker
community, which conducts probes in order to help strengthen networks
from adversary attacks.82 It also implies sacrificing some espionage and
offensive cyber options to ensure partners can patch their networks and
update their defenses.

#### Disclosing OCOs moots their efficiency and undermines any potential stability

However, rather than solely observing defensive exercises, the spirit
behind the exchange of observers in the Helsinki Final Act was to
[provide reassurance among potential adversaries regarding each other\'s
offensive forces]{.underline}-in other words, those that could pose a
threat to stability. However, [**building offensive cyber operations**
into existing defensive]{.underline} [exercises **is fraught with
difficulties**.]{.underline} Currently, cybersecurity exercises
typically have a [defensive focus]{.underline} and are used to identify
both technical and procedural vulnerabilities on internal networks.58
For example, [most exercises spearheaded by the United States typically
do not showcase the units that would conduct offensive operations or
their capabilities]{.underline} and, therefore, are [not designed to
signal confidence in the command and control and efficacy of their
offensive cyber forces]{.underline}. 

It is possible to incorporate offensive actions into existing defensive
exercises. For instance, a state could build into a defensive scenario a
counterstrike that targets an infected server commanding the attack.
However, [any **capability for access and attack**]{.underline} that
would be used in the scenario [would most likely be **limited to
publicly available open source tools** or would be **fictionalized** so
as not to give away to the adversary the **specific vulnerability** in
the target system it would]{.underline} [be exploiting]{.underline}.
Again, this reflects the [**fundamental requirement of secrecy** for
operational success]{.underline}. The [ephemeral nature of offensive
cyber capabilities]{.underline} and accesses [means that **revealing
information** about them effectively]{.underline} **[renders them
moot]{.underline}**.59 If a state used real cyber weapons from its
arsenal, it is likely that any observing state (including allies) would
develop hardware and software upgrades to render the demonstrated
capability inert. Similar to the paradox presented by cyber arms
control, this may **[undermine the very stability CBMs seek to
create]{.underline}**. However, public notification of the successful
execution of such an exercise could increase the adversary\'s confidence
in the actor\'s ability to command and control cyber capabilities,
thereby serving a confidence building purpose.

B. Policy Tensions

[Policy differences exacerbate conceptual ones]{.underline}. [[Allies
differ in]{.mark} their **[policy]{.mark} and [legal]{.mark}
[constraints]{.mark}**]{.underline}, strategic
**[[cultures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[threat
perception,]{.underline}** **[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
planning and budgetary cycles [[and]{.underline}
[forces]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sondhaus, 2006). While solidarity
ultimately remains NATO's strongest asset, these [differences create
seams]{.underline} that [adversaries can exploit]{.underline}. This is
**[[especially]{.underline}]{.mark}** so **[[with
cyberspace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [where there is more
sensitivity]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [less]{.underline}
[commonality]{.underline} to emerging national approaches than in more
established domains, and to MDO, which is inherently predicated on
integration and interoperability (Sharpy, 2020).

**[[Info]{.underline}]{.mark}**rmation **[[sharing]{.mark} is especially
[problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[for]{.underline} the
[cyber dimension]{.underline} of MDO, [with **[Allies reticent to share
details]{.mark}**]{.underline} of their [capabilities across NATO
[given]{.mark}]{.underline} [[security concerns]{.mark} and political
sensitivities]{.underline}. The issue of permissions is also a
'significant challenge in the development of cyber capabilities',
especially where reconnaissance on Allied soil and networks is required
to detect hostile cyber activity (Watling & Roper, 2019).
[Nations]{.underline} also [have differing policy]{.underline},
[legal]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [ethical stances]{.underline} on
key technologies on which MDO relies. This [**[includes]{.mark}** **the
[use of offensive cyber]{.mark} capabilities**]{.underline} or basing of
hypersonic missiles or longrange penetrating fires in Europe, which some
fear could be destabilising and escalatory (Quintin & Vanholme, 2020).
[NATO]{.underline} similarly [lacks]{.underline} a [common approach to
governance]{.underline} and use of AI, autonomy and automation, all
envisaged as essential enablers for JADC2 (Williams, 2020). This affects
the levels of autonomy (with the human in, on or out of the loop) used
for sensor data fusion and decision-making, or to deliver effects using
uncrewed platforms, automated cyber systems and human-machine teaming
(Scharre, 2018). 138 [In considering]{.underline} cooperation and
[burden-sharing, Allies face]{.underline} several [dilemmas depending
on]{.underline} their [ambitions and resources for]{.underline} both
[cyberspace]{.underline} and MDO. The US must overcome domestic
inter-service rivalries and decide how to integrate partners, including
whether it can accept a multinational vision of MDO that is not imposed
on smaller allies---or excludes them entirely, at NATO's expense---but
rather is genuinely collaborative (Watling & Roper, 2019). [[Larger
Europe]{.mark}an nations [face]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[dilemma
of]{.mark} whether to buy into a]{.underline} [US-led
architecture]{.underline} and system-of-systems [with **[implications
for freedom]{.mark} of action**]{.underline}, data-sharing and
procurement choices, [or]{.underline} [shoulder]{.underline} the [costs
of sovereign]{.underline} or multinational [alternatives]{.underline}.11
They also face choices over how best to contribute to multinational MDO:
whether to aspire to full-spectrum capabilities to allow sovereign
action and offer redundancy to Allies' capabilities or to specialise in
certain domains (e.g. cyber) to offer niche capability and buy leverage
with the US and NATO by making themselves indispensable. [Smaller
nations]{.underline} must decide how to influence larger Allies and
NATO, and what to do if they lack cyber capabilities (or others deemed
central to MDO, e.g. long-range fires) or their [forces are too small to
operate]{.underline} or gain MDO experience at echelons [above
brigade]{.underline} (Watling & Roper, 2019).

The [[economic]{.mark} [fallout]{.mark} of COVID-19]{.underline} also
[[raises]{.mark} **renewed [questions about
affordability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[extent to which Allies]{.mark} are [willing]{.mark} and able [to
invest]{.mark} in new cyber capabilities]{.underline}---though some may
see these as cost-efficient alternatives to land, air or maritime
forces---and how they time investments in ambitious transformation
programmes such as MDO (Clark, 2020). Timing presents both threats and
opportunities from a cyber perspective. [**[Rapid]{.mark}**, hasty
**[transformation]{.mark}** [risks]{.mark} **[undermining]{.mark} NATO
[cohesion]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[and
interoperability]{.underline}**]{.mark} [or creating
vulnerabilities]{.underline} in JADC2 systems [[with immature]{.mark}
cyber [defences]{.mark}]{.underline} (Donaldson & Sciarini, 2019b).
Conversely, overly cautious change risks ceding ground to adversaries
such as Russia and China which are investing heavily in asymmetric
means, including offensive cyber capabilities, to gain an information
advantage over NATO (Kilcullen, 2020).

#### **[No]{.underline} intra-NATO info-sharing -- allies are [reluctant]{.underline} to disclose info; they value [autonomy]{.underline} and fear weaker countries [cannot protect]{.underline} their info.**

//ILake-NoC

Nevertheless, the [[largest barrier to]{.mark} a [joint cyber]{.mark}
capability]{.underline} [[is]{.underline} [national
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} agencies' [[tendency to
keep]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[activities]{.underline}]{.mark} in
cyberspace [highly [classified]{.mark}]{.underline}.182 As Chapter 2
discussed, [effective cyberattacks]{.underline} are utterly [dependent
on excellent intelligence]{.underline}.183 Members have significantly
stepped up intelligence-sharing over the last two decades. They
established the NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre in 2006, the Joint
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance initiative in 2012 and the
Joint Intelligence and Security Division (JISD) in 2017. The JISD's
first Assistant Secretary General, Arndt Freytag von Loringhoven, says
it has fostered a new culture of intelligence cooperation, increased
efficiency and has helped avoid the duplication 37 of effort.184
Notably, he claims this new fusion of intelligence has 'positioned the
JISD to contend effectively with the... cyber... threats increasingly
confronting NATO'.185

However, von Loringhoven's [optimism glosses]{.underline}
[over]{.underline} the **[great difficulty of intra-Alliance
intelligence sharing]{.underline}**. [[Divulging]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[secret]{.underline} [info]{.underline}]{.mark}[rmation is]{.underline}
a trade-off [between trusting a partner]{.underline} enough to share
information [that **[could]{.mark} [endanger one's
own]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[source]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[against]{.underline} the [benefits of doing]{.underline} so.186
Therefore, [[national agencies]{.mark} are **[reluctant to
share]{.mark}**]{.underline} it [with international
organisations]{.underline}, instead [**[preferring]{.underline}**
**[bilat]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[eral
[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[case-by-case]{.mark} [basis]{.mark}]{.underline}.187 It is shared
between states with closely aligned interests, mutual trust and good
diplomatic relations, as seen in the Anglo-American UKUSA Agreement.188
The exclusive 'Five Eyes' Alliance this evolved into is a rare example
of multilateral intelligence sharing, involving NATO members America,
Canada and the UK. These agreements tend to be more concerned with the
security of the intelligence shared rather than its content, due to
concerns over how other states will circulate the information. 189
Accordingly, [wider intelligence cooperation within NATO]{.underline}
would be much [harder to achieve]{.underline}, primarily
[because]{.underline} [many [states **do not share**]{.mark} **strong
levels of [trust]{.mark}**]{.underline}, common interests and diplomatic
relations [with each other]{.underline}. For instance, [France remains
unsympathetic]{.underline} [to intelligence integration]{.underline} in
any multilateral environment, [[preferring]{.mark} strategic
[autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}.190 This is compounded by an uneasy
relationship with the Alliance, with President Emmanuel Macron calling
it 'brain dead' in 2019.191 Furthermore, [some [allies fear]{.mark} that
[if]{.mark}]{.underline} [[countries]{.mark} with [lower resilience
are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[infiltrated]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[they
could]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [[compromise]{.underline}]{.mark}
[sensitive [info]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation [[shared]{.mark} between
members]{.underline}.192 Consequently, **[[apprehension about]{.mark}
[Italy's weak]{.mark} cyber [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}** [hinders
allies' propensity to share]{.underline} with Rome, since the
**[potential for leaks undermines their trust]{.underline}**.193

These [concerns have resulted in a **division between**]{.underline}
those **[member states]{.underline}** that possess more advanced
intelligence assets and those that do not. The former have been
resisting serious intelligence integration, while the latter --
including [[Belgium]{.mark} and]{.underline} The
[[Netherlands]{.underline}]{.mark} -- have even [[pressed for]{.mark} a
[CIA]{.mark}-[style]{.mark} European [agency]{.mark}]{.underline}.194 So
far, [NATO's more powerful members]{.underline} have successfully
**[repelled]{.underline}** such **[initiatives]{.underline}**. Following
the 2015 Paris terror attacks, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel
proclaimed the need for a 'European CIA'.195 Nonetheless,
[[German]{.underline}]{.mark} Interior [Minister]{.underline} Thomas de
Maizière [[shot]{.mark} this [proposal down]{.mark}]{.underline},
claiming that 'I [cannot imagine]{.underline} we will be [willing to
**give up our national sovereignty'**]{.underline}.196

Unsurprisingly, [[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} [own [collaborative
efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} to date have also been **[[heavily limited
by]{.mark} national agencies' [desire for secrecy]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and autonomy. Pushback against greater transparency is especially strong
on the part of the US, which owns a large share of NATO's intelligence
capabilities.197 not have access to all US intelligence, but NATO
releasable information only.198 Such secrecy is a big practical obstacle
to a joint offensive cyber capability. Although it is justified,
elevating America's role in Alliance cyber policy without increasing
transparency would likely limit the tactical and strategic effectiveness
of a combined offensive cyber capability.199 NATO's intelligence fusion
efforts have suffered from other, less important problems too.
[Different languages, cultures]{.underline} [and
infrastructures]{.underline} [have proved to be **structural
constraints**]{.underline}, while battlefield commanders have criticised
the intelligence provided for lacking the strategic dimension.200 For
instance, Lieutenant-General Mark Hertling judged NATO's information on
Islamic State too narrow and target-oriented, thus missing the bigger
picture.201

Overall, the [establishment of a joint capability]{.underline} would
[face]{.underline} some [serious practical problems]{.underline}, [both
when confronting NATO's internal politics and]{.underline} [national
intelligence agencies']{.underline} clandestine modus operandi. [There
would be significant legal hurdles]{.underline} [to overcome
too]{.underline}, which Chapter 4 discusses in more detail.

### 2NC -- A/C -- Mistrust

#### NATO is [rife]{.underline} with [mistrust]{.underline} and [disunity]{.underline} -- cooperation is [structurally]{.underline} impossible.

**Antonopoulos, \'21** -- independent geopolitical analyst (Paul
Antonopoulos; \"2021: A year of NATO disunity like no other\"; BRICS;
https://infobrics.org/post/34879/; 12-29-2021, Accessed
6-25-2022)//ILake-NoC

[2021 is]{.underline} arguably [the year when **[intra-NATO
tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} and rivalry **[[widened more so then
ever]{.underline}]{.mark}** since the alliance\'s inception in 1949.
Although NATO most recently expanded its membership to include
Montenegro in 2017 and North Macedonia in 2020, the [rift caused by
competing interests]{.underline} and the emboldening of revisionist
ideologies (neo-Ottomanism and Anglo Chauvinism) [among bloc members has
only widened]{.underline} in recent years, but no other like 2021.

**[[Intense]{.mark} NATO [disunity]{.mark}]{.underline}** first [became
prevalent during]{.underline} the Syrian [War]{.underline}.
[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark} continues to be
**[[enraged]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that]{.underline} the [[US,]{.mark}
France and other member states [train]{.mark}]{.underline}, fund and arm
the [People's P[rotection Units]{.mark}]{.underline} (YPG), the Syrian
branch of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that Ankara recognizes as a
terrorist organization. Meanwhile, [Washington is furious]{.underline}
[that [Turkey defied warnings to not]{.mark}
[purchase]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}-made
S-400 [missile [defense]{.mark}]{.underline} system, and thus in
December 2020 **[[imposed sanctions on]{.mark} its fellow [NATO
member]{.mark}]{.underline}**, an unprecedented action. With former US
President Donald [Trump]{.underline} [unwilling to confront
Turkey]{.underline} in a serious way in order [to not jeopardize his
personal business interests]{.underline} in the country, his successor
Joe Biden has more willingly confronted his Turkish counterpart Recep
Tayyip Erdoğan.

On Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day (April 24, 2021),
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} [recognized]{.underline} the
[Turkish-perpetrated Armenian Genocide]{.underline}, something
successive presidents refused to do out of fear of
[alienating]{.underline} a [Turkey]{.underline} that was once seen as a
bulwark against the Soviet Union/Russian Federation. Seeing as the
previous non-recognition of the genocide was for political and
geopolitical reasons, the recognition signifies a major change in
Washington's attitude towards Ankara.

Although [Washington]{.underline} bemoans Ankara as being revisionist,
its own [[contradictory revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark} actually
[[caused]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[deeper disunity]{.mark} among
NATO]{.underline}** members in 2021 [following]{.underline} the
**[announcement of [AUKUS]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [a trilateral Anglo
security pact between Australia]{.underline}, the [UK]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the [US]{.underline}. Under the pact, [the US will
share nuclear propulsion tech]{.underline}nology [with]{.underline}
[Australia]{.underline}. This culminated in Canberra [**[cancelling
without notice]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[French]{.mark}--Australian [submarine deal]{.mark}]{.underline} worth
€56 billion, **[ending]{.underline}** efforts for the two countries to
develop a deeper **[strategic partnership]{.underline}**.

The [sudden cancellation]{.underline} of a lucrative contract and
defense strategy with Australia [[was]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[**[humiliation]{.underline}** **[for Paris]{.underline}**]{.mark} as
its [ambitions for more global influence was dealt a blow]{.underline}.
The French Ambassadors to Washington and Canberra were recalled to
Paris, and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said "With Britain, there
is no need. We know their constant opportunism."

Washington pleaded to Paris that it had no knowledge that Canberra was
about to "backstab", as Le Drian termed it, their planned strategic
alliance. The UK's post-Brexit Anglo Chauvinistic ideology, something
that Canberra naturally aligns with, motivated the humiliating manner in
which France was sidelined to make way for AUKUS. This [[total disregard
for French]{.mark} industry]{.underline} and strategic interests [[made
Paris **lose trust in NATO.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

This "backstab" spurred on Paris to seek greater strategic alliances at
a bilateral level, leading to a mutual defense pact that supersedes NATO
with Greece. Greece is also frustrated with NATO as daily Turkish
violations against its airspace, Turkish threats of a casus belli if it
expands its maritime zone in the Aegean Sea to 12 nautical miles from
its six (as permitted by international law), and Turkish attempts to
exploit energy deposits in Greece's maritime space, is met with
indifference. In this way, Athens lost trust in NATO as a peace
guarantor, something that made its pact with France a security
necessity.

The Biden administration praised what Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos
Mitsotakis termed as "strategic autonomy" from Washington, a minor
concession likely to try and appease Paris as it lost its more lucrative
agreement with Australia. However, [[Ankara]{.mark} continually
[berates]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[French-Greek
pact]{.mark},]{.underline} with Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar
[saying that **Greece's alliance with France [will cause]{.mark} [cracks
in NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} On another occasion he said
"\[Greece is\] trying to overpower Turkey with armaments and challenges,
in cooperation with some other countries," an indirect reference to
France. Akar added: "\[Greece\] has different ambitions that it seeks to
achieve through other alliances."

There is clearly a **[[major breakdown in NATO
unity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as [accusations]{.mark} are being made
[between member states]{.mark}]{.underline} on who is responsible for
causing cracks. This comes as the US continues to expect all member
states to be compliant, as the UK retracts to Anglo Chauvinism under the
guise of "Global Britain", as France attempts to have more international
influence, and as Turkey more aggressively pursues a neo-Ottoman policy.

2021 saw Greece and France lose trust in NATO, Turkey accuse Greece of
causing disunity, the US angered as Turkey announces it wants to
purchase another S-400 unit from Russia, and the formation of an Anglo
bloc that seemingly supersedes NATO and French interests. Throw into
this quagmire the massive disparity of interest among NATO members to
support Ukraine against Russia, and it appears that the bloc is
disunited like never before.

These events suggests that [2021 is a year where NATO's
[fragility]{.mark} and disunity]{.underline} [was]{.underline} [[more
apparent than any other yea]{.mark}r]{.underline}, especially in the
post-Cold War period. With these tensions, particular as the Anglo bloc
and Turkey pursue revisionist policies and ideologies, [disunity within
NATO will **[not only]{.mark} [continue into 2022, but
intensify]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[A decade ago, the conventional wisdom held that the world was on the
cusp of a new era of cyberconflict in which]{.mark} catastrophic
[computer-]{.mark}based [attacks would wreak havoc on the]{.mark}
physical [world.]{.mark} [News media warned of doomsday scenarios;
officials in Washington publicly fretted about a \"cyber-Pearl Harbor\"
that would take lives and destroy]{.mark} critical
[infrastructure]{.mark}. The most dire predictions, however, did not
come to pass. [The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tate[s has n]{.mark}o[t been
struck by devastating cyberattacks with physical effects;]{.mark} it
seems that [even if U.S. adversaries wanted to]{.mark} carry out such
assaults[, traditional forms of deterrence]{.mark} would [prevent
them]{.mark} from acting.]{.underline}

Behind those mistaken warnings lay an assumption that the only
alternative to cyberpeace must be cyberwar. [But in the years since, [it
has become clear that like all realms of conflict, the domain of
cyberspace is shaped not by a binary between war and peace but by a
spectrum between those two poles-and most cyberattacks fall somewhere in
that murky space]{.mark}]{.underline}. The obvious upside of this
outcome is that the worst fears of death and destruction have not been
realized. There is a downside, however: the complex nature of
cyberconflict has made it more difficult for the United States to craft
an effective cyberstrategy. And even if lives have not been lost and
infrastructure has mostly been spared, it is hardly the case that
cyberattacks have been harmless. U.S. adversaries have honed their
cyberskills to inflict damage on U.S. national security, the American
economy, and, most worrisome of all, American democracy[. Meanwhile,
[Washington has struggled to move past its initial perception of the
problem, clinging to outmoded ideas that have limited its
responses]{.mark}. The United States has also demonstrated an
unwillingness to consistently confront its adversaries in the
cyber-realm and has suffered from serious self-inflicted wounds [that
have left it in a poor position to advance its national interests in
cyberspace.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To do better, the United States must focus on the most pernicious
threats of all: cyberattacks aimed at weakening societal trust, the
underpinnings of democracy, and the functioning of a globalized economy.
The Biden administration seems to recognize the need for a new approach.
[But to make significant progress, it will need to reform the country\'s
cyberstrategy, starting with its most fundamental aspect: the way
Washington understands the problem.]{.underline}

[[Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a series of experts predicted
cyberwar:]{.mark} the massive use of Russian offensive cyber
capabilities to "shock and awe" Ukraine's defenses and undermine their
will to fight. [Some even suggested Russia need not invade because it
could]{.mark} achieve the same outcomes by [go]{.mark}ing [to
cyberwar]{.mark}.]{.underline} When that did not happen, the same
experts predicted that Russia would still use offensive cyber
capabilities sometime later -- not only against Ukraine, but also
against the West and its critical infrastructure as a punishment for its
sanctions and support of Ukraine. Three months later, this has not
happened either. [[Some experts are still expecting cyberwar to come,
just sometime in the future]{.mark}. Others say that they were right,
and cyberwar is here, except that the threat in Ukraine was deterred, or
that attacks were launched but then neutralized in time. [In
contrast,]{.mark} we claim that [experts who expect cyberwar to happen
keep underestimating the practical limitations of cyberattacks
(]{.mark}also called cyber effects operations) [and consequently
overestimating their]{.mark} strategic [value]{.mark} -- [despite ample
empirical evidence that cyberattacks are not very effective]{.mark} at
coercive and destructive action.]{.underline} We aim to correct the
distorted cyber threat debate by better grounding it in observable
reality. [While cyber operations remain important for intelligence
operations and mildly disruptive attacks, [destructive cyberattacks on
key military or civilian infrastructure are challenging to implement and
ineffective when compared to conventional attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The reason is an operational trilemma that constrains the speed,
intensity, and control that cyber operations can achieve -- thus
limiting their strategic value and rendering catastrophic attacks highly
improbable. Policymakers should focus on countering and mitigating
actual threats, rather than on catastrophic scenarios that are
theoretically possible, yet exceedingly unlikely in practice.

Expectations and Fallacies

[[Doom scenarios about devastating cyberattacks have plagued policy
debates for 30 years]{.mark} and have proven to be stubbornly
persistent. There are two interlinked problems that keep the
specter]{.underline}

[of cyberwar alive:]{.underline}

[The first problem is the inflationary use of the term "cyberwar" for
all politically motivated cyber operations. This glosses over important
differences concerning the perpetrators, capabilities, and strategic
effects]{.underline}. Every incident is read as a proof for rampant
vulnerabilities of modern societies and as a harbinger of doom. In this
view, cyberwar is already here.

[Second, [there is no consensus about the likelihood of a high-level,
destructive cyberattack on civilian critical infrastructures --]{.mark}
the expert definition of cyberwar. [By pointing to society's
vulnerabilities and from there deducing the high likelihood of doom to
come,]{.mark} many still expect it to be imminent. For them, cyberwar
will come or is almost here.]{.underline}

[[Such predictions are guid]{.mark}ed by four [fallacies]{.mark} that
stem from ignoring interaction-effects between technology and
politics:]{.underline}

[The "vulnerability" fallacy: [The assumption that when vulnerabilities
exist, they will be exploited]{.mark}. In reality, the existence of a
vulnerability does not reveal anything about why, how, and
when]{.underline}

[it would make sense for an adversary to exploit it.]{.underline}

The "the hack is the success" fallacy: The belief that the network
intrusion, or hack, itself is proof of success. In reality, the success
of any operation can only be determined by the political or strategic
effects that are achieved through that operation.

[The "cheap and easy" fallacy: [The belief that cyber tools]{.mark}
(software) [are a low-risk "weapon]{.mark}" for the weak. [In
reality]{.mark}, controlled, targeted [attacks]{.mark} suitable to reach
strategic goals [are]{.mark} not cheap and easy but [hard, complicated,
and risky.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The "just pull the trigger" fallacy: [The belief that cyber tools work
like conventional arms. In reality, cyber operations usually take months
if not years]{.mark} to prepare and deliver. They are not something we
can simply "launch" at a whim, and their use requires planning and
integration into chains of command.]{.underline}

[Technology constrains what is achievable politically, whereas politics
constrains what will be attempted technologically. Russian cyberattacks,
clearly attributed to the Russian government, in Ukraine since 2014 are
an excellent example to demonstrate this both in a hybrid conflict
setting and in an actual war.]{.underline}

#### No Russian Hybrid War-they know it isn't effective

Evidence from Ukraine, 2014--2022

Russia's aggression against Ukraine since 2014 presents a useful case to
examine the effects and strategic value of cyberattacks for at least
three reasons[. First, [Russia is widely held to be one of the world's
foremost cyber powers with significant offensive capabilities]{.mark}.
Second, [from 2014 to 2022 Russia resorted to a strategy of
low-intensity aggression enhanced by cyberattacks]{.mark} that many
analysts have held to be the future of war. Significantly, [such "hybrid
war," as it has since been christened, is supposed to be as
effective]{.mark} as, if not more effective [than, conventional
war]{.mark} due to the effectiveness of cyberoperations[.]{.mark} Third,
Russia has used its cyber capabilities so frequently and in such varied
contexts that some observers have described Ukraine as its "test lab for
cyberwar." Below we examine the sobering results.]{.underline}

Hybrid War (2014--2017). In this conflict phase,

Russia used five disruptive cyber operations against Ukraine (Table 1).
These pursued election interference, critical infrastructure sabotage,
and economic warfare. While some operations achieved observable effects,
a sober look at evidence reveals the shortcomings of such operations.
Cyber operations offer unique strategic advantages because they proceed
in secret and exploit an adversary's own computer systems to use them
against the adversary. As such, they are primarily instruments of
subversion rather than war. Yet exploitation involves a distinct set of
challenges that create an operational trilemma among speed, effects
intensity, and control over effects. Actors can only increase the
effectiveness of one of these variables at the cost of losing out across
the remaining ones.

[[This trilemma is clear across Russia's cyber operations against
Ukraine, as these operations were either too slow, too weak, or too
volatile to produce strategic value.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Even the single exception, the NotPetya malware of 2017 that spread
globally and caused massive economic damage, ultimately proved this
limitation: Its wide spread was an accident -- the hackers lost control
over it.

[[Due to their shortcomings, these operations failed to contribute
measurably towards Russia']{.mark}s dual [strategic objectives]{.mark}
of changing Ukraine's pro-Western foreign policy and undermining public
support for this policy]{.underline}. Interestingly, Russia stopped
attempting disruptive cyberattacks against Ukraine from 2017[. [Russia
failed to achieve its core objectives through hybrid war.]{.mark}
Ukraine maintained its pro-Western foreign policy despite continuing
Russian aggression, including its annexation of Crimea and ongoing
semi-covert warfare in the Donbas.]{.underline}

War (2022--). Hybrid war had failed, hence Russia changed strategy. In
February 2022 it invaded Ukraine, commencing an actual large-scale war.
While Russia amassed its troops along Ukraine's border in the preceding
months, many analysts predicted that if Russia would invade, it would
also unleash cyberattacks of unprecedented destructiveness. [[As the
conflict changed from low-intensity hybrid war to high-intensity
conventional war, the theory went, so would
cyberconflict.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[As before, these expectations built more on theoretical possibilities
than strategic realities and practical constraints. The [essential point
to consider here is that Russia had already tried and failed to achieve
its objectives through cyber operations. Strategically, there was thus
little reason to expect cyberwar to ramp up once Russia had made the
choice in favor of conventional war.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Even if Russia did aim to cause greater destruction through cyber
means, doing so requires significant planning, preparation, and
resources -- foremost, time. None of this was evident. Rather, we
witnessed a string of rushed, haphazardly implemented, and outright
botched cyberoperations (Table 2).]{.underline}

The operational trilemma predicts that the faster one operates, the
lower the intensity of effects, and the greater the risk of control
loss. Both constraints are in evidence. Most operations used "fast and
easy" yet low-intensity effects like data wiping, website defacements,
and DDoS attacks. [[More complex attacks failed or ran out of
control.]{.mark} The attempt to cause a power blackout in April 2022
with the same malware as in 2016 stands out as a complete failure.
Meanwhile, a disruption of the Viasat satellite communications network
evidently aimed at cutting Ukrainian military communications failed to
produce a measurable effect on these communications. Instead, it spread
uncontrollably, causing significant collateral damage for the service's
other European customers, including thousands of wind turbines in
Germany.]{.underline}

[[Overall, there is no evidence that any of the Russian-sponsored
operations]{.mark} or, in fact, any of the operations related to this
conflict (including the various hacktivist "armies" that have sprung up)
[measurably affected the course of the conflict, provided observable
tactical advantages -- such as sabotaging military equipment or
disrupting enemy communications during battle -- or produced strategic
value.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Reality Check

The constraints posed by the operational trilemma render

[[cyberoperations relatively slow, ineffective, and
unreliable.]{.underline}]{.mark}

These shortcomings limit their strategic value, both in hybrid and
conventional conflict. Yet overestimation of their strategic potential
continues, evident most recently in the dramatic warnings of impending
cyberwar in Ukraine. These predictions both overestimated what cyber
operations can achieve while underestimating Ukrainian defenses.

Due to the cyber-fallacies outlined above, experts continue to
misrepresent the utility of cyberattacks, focusing on possibilities
rather than considering their actual effects. Hence, in assessing the
reports on cyberattacks it remains important to separate hype from
reality.

Moreover, most analyses underestimated both the effects of victims'
learning -- with Ukraine being targeted by Russian "cyber
experimentation" for years -- and the role of defensive measures. In
particular, Ukraine's collaboration with defensive cyber teams from
abroad is a potential

## No impact to meltdowns

[[A]{.mark} particular [nuclear scenario was loss of cooling which
resulted in melting of the nuclear reactor core,]{.mark} and this
motivated studies on both the physical and chemical possibilities as
well as the biological effects of any dispersed radioactivity. [Those
responsible for]{.mark} nuclear power [tech]{.mark}nology in the West
[devoted extraordinary effort to ensuring that a meltdown of the reactor
core would not take place]{.mark}, since it was assumed that a meltdown
of the core would create a major public hazard, and if uncontained, a
tragic accident with likely multiple fatalities. [In avoiding such
accidents the industry has been very successful. In the 60-year history
of civil nuclear power generation, with over 18,500 cumulative
reactor-years across 36 countries, there have been only three
significant accidents at nuclear power plants:]{.mark}]{.underline}

Three Mile Island (USA 1979) where the reactor was severely damaged but
radiation was contained and there were no adverse health or
environmental consequences.

Chernobyl (Ukraine 1986) where the destruction of the reactor by steam
explosion and fire killed two people initially plus a further 28 from
radiation poisoning within three months, and had significant health and
environmental consequences.

Fukushima Daiichi (Japan 2011) where three old reactors (together with a
fourth) were written off after the effects of loss of cooling due to a
huge tsunami were inadequately contained. There were no deaths or
serious injuries due to radioactivity, though about 19,500 people were
killed by the tsunami.

[Of all the accidents and incidents, [only the Chernobyl and Fukushima
accidents resulted in radiation doses]{.mark} to the public [greater
than those]{.mark} resulting [from the exposure to natural
sources.]{.mark} The [Fukushima accident resulted in some radiation
exposure of workers at the plant, but not such as to threaten their
health]{.mark}, unlike Chernobyl. Other incidents (and one \'accident\')
have been completely confined to the plant. [Apart from Chernobyl, no
nuclear workers or members of the public have ever died as a result of
exposure to radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor
incident]{.mark}.]{.underline} Most of the serious radiological injuries
and deaths that occur each year (2-4 deaths and many more exposures
above regulatory limits) are the result of large uncontrolled radiation
sources, such as abandoned medical or industrial equipment. (There have
also been a number of accidents in experimental reactors and in one
military plutonium-producing pile -- at Windscale, UK, in 1957 -- but
none of these resulted in loss of life outside the actual plant, or
long-term environmental contamination.) See also Table in Appendix 2:
Serious Nuclear Reactor Accidents cumulative reactor years of operation
experience nuclear plants It should be emphasised that a commercial-type
power reactor simply cannot under any circumstances explode like a
nuclear bomb -- the fuel is not enriched beyond about 5%, and much
higher enrichment is needed for explosives.The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) was set up by the United Nations in 1957. One of
its functions was to act as an auditor of world nuclear safety, and this
role was increased greatly following the Chernobyl accident. It
prescribes safety procedures and the reporting of even minor incidents.
Its role has been strengthened since 1996 (see later section). Every
country which operates nuclear power plants has a nuclear safety
inspectorate and all of these work closely with the IAEA.While nuclear
power plants are designed to be safe in their operation and safe in the
event of any malfunction or accident, no industrial activity can be
represented as entirely risk-free. Incidents and accidents may happen,
and as in other industries, what is learned will lead to a progressive
improvement in safety. Those improvements are both in new designs, and
in upgrading of existing plants. The long-term operation (LTO) of
established plants is achieved by significant investment in such
upgrading.The safety of operating staff is a prime concern in nuclear
plants. [[Radiation exposure is minimised by the use of remote handling
equipment for many operations in the core of the
reactor.]{.underline}]{.mark} Other controls include physical shielding
and limiting the time workers spend in areas with significant radiation
levels. These are supported by continuous monitoring of individual doses
and of the work environment to ensure very low radiation exposure
compared with other industries. The use of nuclear energy for
electricity generation can be considered extremely safe. Every year
several hundred people die in coal mines to provide this widely used
fuel for electricity. There are also significant health and
environmental effects arising from fossil fuel use. Contrary to popular
belief, nuclear power saves lives by displacing fossil fuel from the
electricity mix. Achieving safety: the reactor core [[Concerning
possible accident]{.mark}s, up to the early 1970s, [some extreme
assumptions were made about the possible]{.mark} chain of
[consequences.]{.mark} [These gave rise to a genre of dramatic
fiction]{.mark} (e.g. The China Syndrome) in the public domain and also
some solid conservative engineering including containment structures in
the industry itsel]{.underline}f. Licensing regulations were framed
accordingly. [It was not until the late 1970s that detailed analyses and
large-scale testing, followed by the 1979 meltdown of the Three Mile
Island reactor, [began to make clear that even the worst possible
accident in a conventional western nuclear power plant or its fuel would
not be likely to cause dramatic public harm.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
industry still works hard to minimize the probability of a meltdown
accident, but it is now clear that no-one need fear a potential public
health catastrophe simply because a fuel meltdown happens. [[Fukushima
Daiichi has made that clear, with a triple meltdown causing no
fatalities or serious radiation doses to anyone]{.mark}, while over two
hundred people continued working onsite to mitigate the accident\'s
effects. [The decades-long test and analysis programme showed that less
radioactivity escapes from molten fuel than initially assumed, and that
most of this radioactive material is not readily mobilized beyond the
immediate internal structure.]{.mark} Thus, even if the containment
structure that surrounds all modern nuclear plants were ruptured, as was
the case with one of the Fukushima reactors, it is still very effective
in preventing the escape of most radioactivity.]{.underline}

## No impact to warming 

#### No climate impact\-\--[bad studies]{.underline} and [adaption]{.underline}.

Institute Oslo, "This time is different! Or is it? NeoMalthusians and
environmental optimists in the age of climate change," Journal of Peace
Research, pg. 5-6, 2021, SAGE. clarification denoted with brackets.

The most extreme contrarian position is, of course, to deny one or both
key conclusions of the IPCC: the reality of global warming or the human
contribution to it. However, most [environmental
**optimists**]{.underline} accept these two key conclusions but
[[raise]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[problem]{.mark}s [with]{.mark}
the]{.underline} panel's [discussion of]{.underline} the social
[**effects of climate** **change** and]{.underline} even [more so
with]{.underline} **[[popular interp]{.mark}retations]{.underline}** of
the panel reports. For instance, Hausfather & Peters (2020), by no means
'climate deniers', [decry the **common** use [of]{.mark} choosing [the
**high-risk**]{.mark} **[\[scenario\]]{.mark}**]{.underline} RCP8.59 [to
illustrate **'business [as usual']{.mark}** [as
**misleading**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [[causal chain]{.mark}s from climate change to]{.underline} the
[**proposed** effects on human beings [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[long]{.mark}** and **complex**, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[uncertain]{.mark}ty increases every step** of the way]{.underline}.
[In the literature]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the social [effects of
climate change, including]{.underline} the [**IPCC [reports]{.mark}**,
**statements** abound]{.underline} that [something **'may' lead** to
something else, or]{.underline} that [a variable **'is sensitive to'
another**, [without]{.mark}]{.underline} any [[guidelines]{.mark} for
[how to **translate**]{.mark} this [into
**probabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gleditsch & Nordås, 2014: 87f).
[Uncritical use of the **[precautionary principle]{.mark}**, where
**a**]{.underline}ny [**remotely** possible]{.underline} [calamity
unwittingly becomes]{.underline} a [probable]{.underline} event, **[[is
not helpful]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Gleditsch & Nordås]{.underline} (2014: 85) note that while AR5 (IPCC,
2014) [did **[no]{.mark}**t find [**strong evidence** for]{.mark} a
[**direct** link between climate]{.mark} change [and
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, it **[argue]{.underline}**d that
[climate]{.underline} [change]{.underline} is likely to
[impact]{.underline} known **[conflict-inducing factors]{.underline}**
like poverty and inconsistent political institutions and therefore might
have an indirect effect on conflict. But [this]{.underline}
[[assumes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[correlations are
**transitive**]{.mark}, which is not generally the case]{.underline}.
[If **A correlates with B** and **B with C**, we know nothing about how
**A relates to C** unless]{.underline} [**both**
correlations]{.underline} [are **extremely high**]{.underline}. The
strongest case for the climate--conflict link is the effect of
interaction between climate change and factors like poverty, state
failure, or ethnic polarization. It may be more cost-effective to try to
deal with these other risk factors than with global warming itself if
the goal is to reduce the 'risk multiplier' effect of climate change on
armed conflict.

The articles in this special issue do not generally see scarcity by
itself as necessarily resulting in strongly negative outcomes. Factors
like development, state failure, and previous overload on ecosystems
continue to play an important role in that they interact with climate
change to produce conflict and other social outcomes. For instance, Ide,
Kristensen & Bartusevicˆius (2021) conclude that the impact of floods on
political conflict are contingent on other factors such as population
size and regime type. Moreover, most of the articles do not assume that
scarcities are likely to arise at the global level. They may be regional
(mostly in Africa), national, or local. Urban and rural areas may be
affected by different scarcities. Climate change may also affect
particularly strongly groups that are already at an economic or
political disadvantage. The effects can be alleviated and adaptations
constructed at these levels.

The [argument]{.underline} about [how climate change]{.underline} may
[indirectly impact **conflict** leans heavily on]{.underline} the
[**negative economic consequences** of climate change]{.underline}, but
[with little or **no reference** to]{.underline} the [research
that]{.underline} explicitly [deals with this topic]{.underline}. In
fact, the relevant chapter in AR5 concluded that for most sectors of the
economy, the impact of climate change was likely to be dwarfed by other
factors. Tol (2018) finds that the long-term global economic effects are
likely to be negative, but that a [century of climate change will
have]{.underline} about [the]{.underline} [**same impact** on the
economy as the **loss of one year** of economic growth]{.underline}.
Other economists are more cautious, but the dean of climate change
economics, William Nordhaus (2018: 345, 359), estimates that 'damages
are 2.1 percent of global income at 3C warming and 8.5 percent of income
at 6C', while also warning that the longer the delay in taking decisive
action, the harsher the necessary countermeasures. Stern (2006) is more
pessimistic, based mainly on a lower discount rate (the interest rate
used to calculate the present value of future cash flows) as are Wagner
& Weitzman (2015). Heal (2017) argues that the Integrated Assessment
[[Models]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [used in the]{.underline}
[**assessment** of]{.underline} the [economics of climate change [are
**not accurate**]{.mark} **enough** [to]{.mark}
[provide]{.mark}]{.underline} [**quantitative insights**
and]{.underline} should [not be taken as [**serious**
forecasts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, all these economists take the
basically optimistic view that climate change is manageable with
appropriate policies for raising the price on the emission of greenhouse
gases. With a chapter heading from Wagner & Weitzman (2015: 17): 'We can
do this'.

This more optimistic assessment of climate change does not assume that
the challenge will go away by itself or can be left to the market. A
plausible approach, favored by most economists,10 is the imposition of a
robust and increasing price on carbon emissions (whether as a carbon tax
or through a cap and trade scheme) high enough to reduce the use of
fossil fuels and encourage the search for their replacement. More than
25 countries had such taxes by early 2018 (Metcalf, 2019), but generally
not at a level seen as necessary for limiting global warming to, say,
2C. This approach relies on the use of the market mechanism, but with
targets fixed by public policy. Income from a carbon tax can be
channeled back to the citizens to avoid increasing overall taxation. To
speed up the transition, funds can also be allocated to the research and
development of cheaper and more efficient production of various forms of
fossil-free energy, including nuclear power (Goldstein & Qvist, 2019).

The response of the [environmental optimists]{.underline} continues to
[emphasize the role of]{.underline}
**[[innovation]{.mark}s]{.underline}**; technological innovations,
[[such as]{.mark} **improvements in battery
[tech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}, the key element in the 2019 Nobel
Prize in chemistry,11 [but [also]{.mark}]{.underline} [[social]{.mark}
innovations]{.underline}, as [exemplified by the **experimental**
**approach** to the alleviation of **poverty**]{.underline}, rewarded in
the same year by the Nobel Prize in economics.12

While the most important countermeasures will be directed at the
mitigation of climate change, [there is]{.underline} also [a
[strong]{.mark} case for **[adaptation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If
sea-level rise cannot be totally prevented, [dikes and flood barriers
will [be]{.mark} **[cost-effective]{.mark}** and
**necessary**]{.underline}, at least in high-value urban areas. If parts
of Africa suffer from drought, [there will be increased use for **[new
crops]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are [**more suitable** for a **dry**
climate]{.underline}, possibly [developed in part by **GMO
technology**]{.underline}. **[[Industrialization]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in Africa can [[decrease]{.mark} the **one-sided [reliance]{.mark}** on
rain-fed]{.underline} [agriculture]{.underline}, as it has
[in]{.underline} other parts of [the world]{.underline}, which have
moved human resources from the primary sector to industry (and then to
services). Continuing [[urbanization]{.mark} will]{.underline}
[[move]{.mark} millions [out]{.mark} of the **most [vulnerable
communities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Collier, 2010). While structural
change failed to produce economic growth in Latin America and Africa
after 1990, Africa has experienced a turnaround in the new millennium
(McMillan & Rodrik, 2014) and [there are]{.underline} also [potentials
for [increasing **productivity** by **structural**]{.mark}
**[change]{.mark}** within agriculture]{.underline} in Africa
(McCullough, 2017).

## NATO bad/not key 

#### NATO obsolete -- causes more harm than good

political and cultural history of the U.S. in the 20th century. His
research focuses on the connection between U.S. domestic culture and
foreign policy, "On NATO",**

**)//MargaretE**

Three decades on, we are still stuck with the alliance, and as recent
events demonstrate, it is no laughing matter. **[NATO has become
obsolete]{.underline}**. Indeed, [Washington's whole Europe-first
orientation is anachronistic, a wasteful, expensive holdover from the
cold war that ought to have been abandoned years ago and that distracts
us from the true dangers we face abroad.]{.underline}

Mearsheimer, to his credit, deplored this development more vehemently
than anyone. A self-described "unrepentant realist," he had no patience
for the aggressive internationalism that defined Western statecraft in
the Clinton, Bush, and Obama presidencies. NATO as an anti-Soviet bloc
made sense to him; [NATO as an ever-expanding club of vaguely
like-minded nations was foolish---and dangerous.]{.underline} According
to the tenets of realism, [when one great power trespasses upon
another's sphere of influence, the result is nearly always
conflict]{.underline}, and Mearsheimer insisted that [that was the case
with NATO's eastward march.]{.underline} It did not matter that
officials from the United States and its European allies insisted that
they had no designs on Russia. [Russian President Vladimir Putin was not
convinced. He perceived their encroachment as an existential threat and
responded violently, first by annexing Crimea in 2014, then by invading
Ukraine in 2022.]{.underline} While most pundits in the West denounced
Putin's barefaced breach of international law, Mearsheimer proclaimed
that **[NATO was to blame]{.underline}**, that its leaders ought to have
recognized that their apparent intent to incorporate Russia's bordering
countries into their alliance would trigger war, and that Putin was only
doing what an American president would do if, say, Iran built a military
association and invited Mexico and Canada to join. In a
gauntlet-flinging guest essay for the Economist in March and a follow-up
interview in the New Yorker, Mearsheimer condemned NATO for naiveté and
called for a pragmatic solution to the crisis that would keep Ukraine as
a neutral country and leave Putin in power, with Crimea and the Donbas
in his grasp.

I am not a realist, repentant or otherwise, and I have problems with
Mearsheimer's glibness and moral relativism. Nonetheless, I agree with
him that **[NATO no longer serves a coherent purpose]{.underline}**.
[The principal geopolitical challenge to U.S. primacy in the 21st
century comes from China. That is where America's focus should
be.]{.underline} Russia might still qualify as a great power in terms of
boots on the ground, but its economy is one-dimensional and shot through
with corruption, its population shrinking and aging, its weapons and
equipment outmoded, and its troops demoralized. By no stretch of the
imagination could it overrun Europe as the old Soviet Union once seemed
capable of doing. Britain and France have nuclear weapons. They do not
need the United States to defend them. Why, then, does Washington
continue to station forces in Europe and bear most of the cost of this
transatlantic military partnership?

Institutional factors play a role, of course---NATO employs many
bureaucrats who have a stake in its preservation, and no business
dissolves itself voluntarily---but the main reason, in my opinion, is
[that Americans have yet to outgrow the delusions that prevailed
in]{.underline} what neoconservative columnist Charles Krauthammer
called [the "unipolar moment,"]{.underline} that heady time after the
cold war ended and no one appeared to threaten the security of the
United States. Flush with victory, [Washington policymakers believed
that they could use this period of unprecedented economic, military,
diplomatic, and geopolitical supremacy to remake the world in the
American image, and they thought NATO was the perfect vehicle for
accomplishing this goal]{.underline} on the Eurasian landmass. Thus they
changed NATO's original mandate and set about trying to foster liberal
democracies in new member states like Hungary, Estonia, Bulgaria, and
Slovakia. (Of course, the War on Terror saw this pattern extended to the
greater Middle East, as the George W. Bush administration sought to
democratize Afghanistan and Iraq.) A widely held assumption was that
increasing the number of liberal democracies would make war less likely,
since democracies do not fight one another. NATO aggrandizement would
therefore create a broad zone of peace from the Elbe River to the gates
of Russia, and perhaps beyond.

Events have not played out in that fashion. Far from nourishing
democracy, [NATO has seen the rise of far-right nationalist political
movements in four of its oldest and most powerful members---Britain,
Germany, France, and the United States]{.underline}---while Viktor
Orbán's second term as Hungarian prime minister witnessed an erosion of
press freedom, a decrease in judicial independence, and Hungary's
descent by eleven places on the Democracy Index. Similar democratic
backsliding has characterized Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's Turkey and Jaroslaw
Kaczynski's Poland[. As for being a force for peace, the carnage in
Ukraine serves as eloquent testimony to NATO's failure in this
regard.]{.underline} Mearsheimer's diagnosis of the origins of the
conflict may be wrong---Putin might have tried to integrate neighboring
nations into a greater Russia regardless of Western actions---but NATO
did nothing to halt his aggression. And, of course[, there is the
perennial free-riding problem, with America's allies counting on
Washington to protect them even if their economies are robust enough to
pay for their own defense]{.underline}. Moving NATO eastward has
increased the number of countries America is obliged to safeguard at a
time when a COVID-induced recession makes such commitments unaffordable.

Clearly, [NATO has outlived its usefulness to the United States**. The
Biden administration should disengage from the alliance as soon as
practicable.**]{.underline} This can be done diplomatically, with some
face-saving rhetoric and assurances that the departure of U.S. troops
will not adversely affect Euro-American investment or trade. We could
also remind nations like Spain and Turkey that they remain free to arm
themselves to the teeth with American-made weapons---provided, of
course, that they foot the bill. Then Washington should recalibrate its
grand strategy to conform to the changed global balance of power.

#### NATO cooperation worsens deterrence and provokes Russia war 

**Carpenter 2022 (Ted Galen Carpenter is senior fellow for defense and

"NATO Security Dependents Are Not Useful Allies",**
<https://www.cato.org/commentary/nato-security-dependents-are-not-useful-allies>
**)//MargaretE**

SINCE THE end of World War II, U.S. officials have had an unduly
expansive concept of what constitutes worthwhile strategic allies for
the United States. In too many cases, [the "allies" that Washington
touts are small, weak, often militarily useless dependents.]{.underline}
Worse, [some of them are on bad terms with more powerful neighboring
states.]{.underline} Under those circumstances, [the so‐​called allies
are major liabilities rather than assets]{.underline} to the United
States. Indeed, they are potential snares, [ones that can entangle
America in unnecessary military confrontations.]{.underline}

Washington would do well to become far more selective about which
nations it includes in its roster of allies, and U.S. leaders should
stop elevating security dependents to the status of allies. When U.S.
officials described the regimes that Washington installed through
military force in Afghanistan and Iraq as allies, it became clear that
they had lost even minimal understanding of the concept. That point
became abundantly evident when their Afghan client collapsed almost
overnight in the face of the Taliban military offensive. [It's time for
U.S. policymakers to do better.]{.underline}

TROUBLING PROMISCUITY about acquiring weak U.S. security partners was
evident even during the Cold War, and the tendency has become even more
pronounced in the post‐​Cold War era. As the fiasco in Afghanistan (and
its ugly predecessor in South Vietnam) confirmed, that problem with U.S.
foreign policy has existed in multiple regions. [However, the defect has
become most acute with respect to Washington's campaign to expand NATO
into Eastern Europe]{.underline}. Since the mid‐​1990s, [U.S.
administrations have worked to add a menagerie of new NATO members, and
it has done so with even less selectivity and good judgment than some
people use to acquire Facebook friends.]{.underline}

[Many of those new members have very little to offer to the United
States as security partners.]{.underline} Indeed[, some are mini‐​states,
bordering on being micro‐​states.]{.underline} Such lightly armed
Lilliputians [would add little or nothing to Washington's own
capabilities---especially in a showdown with another major
power.]{.underline}

[As economic assets, their importance is decidedly limited, and
militarily, they are even less valuable. It's hard to see how new NATO
allies such as Albania, Slovenia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia
enhance America's power and security.]{.underline} That point should be
apparent based on size of population alone. Albania's 2.87 million,
North Macedonia's 2.1 million, and Slovenia's 2.07 million people put
those countries squarely in the mini‐​state category, while Montenegro's
628,000 barely deserves even that label. It doesn't get much better with
respect to either annual gross domestic product or size of military
forces. Even Slovenia's \$52.8 billion GDP puts that country only
eighty‐​sixth in the global rankings. Albania's \$15.2 billion (125th),
North Macedonia's \$12.26 billion (135th) and Montenegro's \$4.78
billion (159th) are even less impressive.

The military forces that our new NATO allies can field are not likely to
strike fear into Russia or any other would‐​be aggressor. Albania's armed
forces consist of 8,500 active‐​duty personnel, Slovenia's consist of
8,500, and North Macedonia has 9,000 available. Montenegro's active‐​duty
force totals 2,400. In comparison, the Austin, Texas, police department
has 2,422 people in its ranks.

Granted, the Cold War edition of NATO also had some mini‐​states as
members, most notably Luxembourg and Iceland. However, those members
were located within a stable, democratic Western Europe. Their defense
also was geographically inseparable from Washington's mission of
protecting important military and economic players, such as West
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Great Britain, from what appeared to
be a totalitarian superpower with expansionist ambitions. That situation
was qualitatively different from Washington's gratuitous post‐​Cold War
decision to manage the security of quarrelsome mini‐​states in the
chronically volatile Balkans. Since the mid‐​1990s, the United States has
entangled itself in the region's parochial spats, but [giving some of
the countries NATO membership intensified America's exposure to needless
risks and burdens.]{.underline}

[THE RISK-BENEFIT calculation is even worse with respect to some of the
other small nations that have joined]{.underline} NATO in the post‐​Cold
War era. [Those partners are not merely irrelevant from the standpoint
of U.S. security; **they are potentially dangerous tripwires that could
trigger a conflict between the United States and a nuclear‐​armed
Russia.**]{.underline}

That point underscores one very important difference between individuals
casually amassing Facebook friends and the United States promiscuously
adding new security mendicants. Facebook friends do not have the ability
to entangle anyone in armed conflicts; irresponsible security dependents
definitely can do so. Indeed, there are multiple examples throughout
history of such clients snaring their patrons into devastating,
unnecessary wars. One notable example was how Tsarist Russia's fateful
decision to give strong backing to Serbia in the latter's escalating
quarrel with Austria‐​Hungary following the assassination of Archduke
Franz Ferdinand helped ignite World War I---and caused the utter ruin of
the Russian empire.

The United States is flirting with a similar danger today regarding its
small clients in Eastern Europe. President George W. [Bush's decision to
support the NATO membership bids of the three Baltic republics was---and
remains---highly provocative to Russia.]{.underline} [One crucial way to
reduce the danger of armed clashes between great powers is to show
mutual respect for respective spheres of influence. Washington has
repeatedly violated that principle by pushing NATO to expand right up to
Russia's border.]{.underline}

### 1NC Topicality -- "Cybersecurity"

#### Cybersecurity is defensive -- tactics that protect systems in the securer's possession. NOT attacks on other systems.

\| Definition, Types. How It Works. Retrieved June 24, 2022, from

[Cybersecurity is the act of implementing sophisticated layers of
network defense and firewalls to protect critical systems and sensitive
information against threats from digital attacks]{.underline}. The
reality is that the types and severity of cybercrime are constantly
evolving and multiplying. There are malware attacks such as viruses that
attempt to destroy data. Ransomware is a particularly nasty type that
locks down systems and threatens to erase data unless a ransom is paid.
Phishing scams try to trick unsuspecting end users into giving up
sensitive personal information such as social security (SSI) and credit
card numbers to sell on the dark web. There are Distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that overwhelm a website with traffic.
Man-in-the-Middle attacks involve hackers trying to intercept messages
between two parties to steal company data. And not all threats are
external. Current or former employees with a grudge and intimate network
knowledge can wreak havoc on a business from behind the firewall.
Companies must be on the lookout for cybercrime from all directions.
[Cybersecurity solutions, therefore, are applications, measures, and
devices that constantly monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
Upon detecting a threat, it isolates and quarantines affected files and
devices, and immediately alerts IT staff as to the exact location and
proper response to the breach, limiting its impact and assisting with
recovery.]{.underline} Cybersecurity [management includes physical
controls, procedural controls, technical controls, and compliance
controls]{.underline}. There are [tools that search for signs of stolen
credentials on the dark web, and silicon-based boot processes to
validate servers have not been compromised]{.underline} in Zero-trust
environments. Maintaining [cybersecurity in a constantly evolving threat
environment is a never ending challenge, and one that usually requires
outside expertise.]{.underline}

#### 

A newly disclosed [Department of Defense doctrinal]{.underline}
[publication](https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_12r.pdf) [acknowledges
the reality of offensive cyberspace operations, and provides a military
perspective on their utility and their hazards]{.underline}. [Attacks in
cyberspace can be used "to degrade, disrupt, or destroy access to,
operation of, or availability of a target by a specified level for a
specified time." Or they can be used "to control or change the
adversary's information, information systems, and/or networks in a
manner that supports the commander's objectives."]{.underline} However,
any [offensive cyber operations (OCO)]{.underline} must be predicated on
"careful consideration of projected effects" and "appropriate
consideration of nonmilitary factors such as foreign policy
implications." "The [growing reliance on cyberspace around the globe
requires carefully controlling OCO, requiring national level
approval]{.underline}," according to the newly disclosed [Cyberspace
Operations](https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_12r.pdf), Joint
Publication 3-12(R). That publication was first issued by the Joint
Chiefs of Staff as a SECRET document in February 2013 (as JP 3-12,
without the R). But this week it was reissued as a public document. It
is unclear whether the public document has been redacted or modified for
release. The discussion [of "offensive cyberspace operations" in the
original, classified version of JP 3-12 led to adoption of that term in
the official DoD lexicon for the first time in]{.underline} [March
2013](https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp1_02-march-2013.pdf), where it
has remained through [the latest

cyberspace operations (OCO) are "intended to project power by the
application of force in and through cyberspace. OCO will be authorized
like offensive operations in the physical domains, via an execute order
(EXORD)."]{.underline} The [DoD
document](https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_12r.pdf) is fairly candid
about the challenges and limitations of cyberspace operations.
"Activities in cyberspace by a sophisticated adversary may be difficult
to detect" and to attribute to their source. Yet such detection and
attribution capabilities are "critical" for enabling offensive and
defensive cyberspace operations. By the same token, "first-order effects
of \[US cyberspace operations\] are often subtle, and assessment of
second- and third-order effects can be difficult," requiring
"significant intelligence capabilities and collection efforts" to
evaluate.

**Turns their offense---limits are vital to creativity and innovation** 

David **Intrator** (President of The Creative Organization) October 21,
**2010** "Thinking Inside the Box,"
http://www.trainingmag.com/article/thinking-inside-box  //kinsey

One of the most pernicious myths about creativity, one that seriously
inhibits creative thinking and innovation, is the belief that one needs
to "think outside the box."  As someone who has worked for decades as a
professional creative, nothing could be further from the truth. This a
is view shared by the vast majority of creatives, expressed famously by
the modernist designer Charles Eames when he wrote, "Design depends
largely upon constraints."  The myth of thinking outside the box stems
from a fundamental misconception of what creativity is, and what it's
not.  In the popular imagination, creativity is something weird and
wacky. The creative process is magical, or divinely inspired.  But, in
fact, [creativity is]{.underline} not about divine inspiration or magic.
It's [about problem-solving, and by definition a problem is a
constraint]{.underline}, [a limit, a box.]{.underline} One of the best
illustrations of this is the work of photographers. They create by
excluding the great mass what's before them, choosing a small frame in
which to work. Within that tiny frame, literally a box, they uncover
relationships and establish priorities. [What makes creative
problem-solving uniquely challenging is that]{.underline} you, as the
creator, are the one defining the problem. You're the one choosing the
frame. And you alone determine what's an effective solution. This can be
quite demanding, both intellectually and emotionally. Intellectually,
[you are required to **establish limits**]{.underline}, set priorities,
and cull patterns and relationships from a great deal of material, much
of it fragmentary. More often than not, this is the material you
generated during brainstorming sessions. At the end of these sessions,
you're usually left with a big mess of ideas, half-ideas, vague notions,
and the like. Now, chances are you've had a great time making your mess.
You might have gone off-site, enjoyed a "brainstorming camp," played a
number of warm-up games. You feel artistic and empowered. But [to be
truly creative]{.underline}, you have to clean up your mess,
[organizing]{.underline} those [fragments into something]{.underline}
real, something [useful]{.underline}, something that actually works.
[That's the hard part.]{.underline} It takes a lot of energy, time, and
willpower to make sense of the mess you've just generated. It also can
be emotionally difficult. You'll need to throw out many ideas you
originally thought were great, ideas you've become attached to, because
they simply don't fit into the rules you're creating as you build your
box. 

**The entire game breaks down if we can't agree on what to debate about
-- the topic committee is the comparatively best mechanism for
establishing agreement about what all debates should revolve around,
like whether the USFG should restrict Trump or not** 

**Shively 00** (Ruth Lessl, Assistant Prof Political Science -- Texas
A&M U., Partisan Politics and Political Theory, p. 181-182) 

The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The
[ambiguists]{.underline} must say \"no\" to-they [must reject and
limit-some ideas]{.underline} and actions. In what follows, we will also
find that they must say \"yes\" to some things. In particular, they must
say \"yes\" to the idea of rational persuasion. This means, first, that
they must recognize the role of agreement in political contest, or the
basic accord that is necessary to discord. The mistake that the
ambiguists make here is a common one. [The mistake is in thinking
that]{.underline} agreement marks the end of contest-that [consensus
kills debate.]{.underline} But this is true only if the agreement is
perfect-if there is nothing at all left to question or contest. [In most
cases, however]{.underline}, our agreements are highly imperfect. [We
agree on]{.underline} some matters but not on others, on [generalities
but not on specifics]{.underline}, on principles but not on their
applications, and so on. And this kind of limited agreement is the
*starting* condition of contest and debate. As John Courtney Murray
writes: [We hold certain truths; therefore we can argue about
them.]{.underline} It seems to have been one of the corruptions of
intelligence by positivism to assume that argument ends when agreement
is reached. In a basic sense, the reverse is true. [There can be no
argument except on the premise, and within a context, of
agreement.]{.underline} (Murray 1960, 10) [In other words, we cannot
argue about something if we are not communicating: if we cannot agree on
the topic and terms of argument]{.underline} or if we have utterly
different ideas about what counts as evidence or good argument[. At the
very least, we must agree about what]{.underline} it is that [is being
debated before we can debate]{.underline} it[. For instance, one cannot
have an argument about euthanasia with someone who thinks euthanasia is
a musical group.]{.underline} One cannot successfully stage a sit-in if
one\'s target audience simply thinks everyone is resting or if those
doing the sitting have no complaints. Nor can one demonstrate resistance
to a policy if no one knows that it is a policy. [In other words,
contest is meaningless if there is a lack of agreement or communication
about what is being contested. Resisters]{.underline}, demonstrators,
[and debaters must have some shared ideas about the subject and/or the
terms of their disagreements.]{.underline} The participants and the
target of a sit-in must share an understanding of the complaint at hand.
And [a demonstrator\'s audience must know what is being
resisted.]{.underline} In short, [the contesting of an idea presumes
some agreement about what that idea is and how one might go about
intelligibly contesting it.]{.underline} In other words, contestation
rests on some basic agreement or harmony. 

### A2 C/I:Cyber Sec = Sec of Cyberspace

#### Both the Barret and Jaihan cards flow aff.

#### While cybersecurity can have many definitions, in the context of public policy it means protection of infrastructure, data, and users. OCO's are not part of that list.

**Jaikaran 20** -- Analyst in Cybersecurity Policy

Chris Jaikaran, \"Cybersecurity: A Primer,\" Congressional Research
Service, 12-15-2020, <https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2020-12-15_IF10559_1d7e5206bb579bce86b7889e28a8ae293466a517.pdf>
//kinsey

[The **Nature of Cybersecurity**]{.underline}

[The term "cyber" is frequently attached to a variety of security
issues, underscoring that issues surrounding]{.underline} the management
of [cyberspace and its security are **big** and
**complicated**.]{.underline}

As an example, consider a single smartphone. An American company may
have designed the device, but the device may be built by a different
company abroad using material from yet another country. The phone runs
on software built by one company but modern operating systems borrow
code from other companies and developers. Once a user has the device it
will likely be connected to a variety of networks such as a home
wireless network, a corporate network, and a cellular network. Each of
these networks has its own infrastructure, but also share common
internet infrastructure. The user will also install applications that
contain code and use infrastructure by yet other myriad companies.
Imagining users at the center, one can see large and intricate systems
on one side and the other to create these devices and ensure those
devices work.

[To highlight **how complicated it is**, consider that the federal
government **does not have a single definition** of cyberspace or
cybersecurity.]{.underline} Recently, the Cyberspace Solarium
Commission---defined "cyber" as

> Relating to, involving, or characteristic of computers, computer
> networks, information and communications technology (ICT), virtual
> systems, or computer-enabled control of physical components.

While this definition may be suitable for a broad discussion about
information technology, it does not account for relevant policymaking
considerations concerning cybersecurity. [Essentially, **cybersecurity
is the security of cyberspace.**]{.underline}

When users go [online]{.underline} they might work with their bank, get
their email, conduct business, or get the news by accessing services.
But those [services don't exist independently. Those services rely on a
**common infrastructure** of servers and switches, miles of cabling,
wireless spectrum, and routers]{.underline}. That same infrastructure is
used by other services too, such as utilities and shipping to ensure
products arrive as intended---or by businesses to develop new products
more efficiently and manage their operations. [The **entire
infrastructure** and **all those services**]{.underline} that [are
**part of cyberspace**]{.underline} exist to deliver an experience to a
user, a human.

Thus[, [from a **policymaking standpoint** cybersecurity can be
considered the **security of cyberspace**---which includes the
**devices, infrastructure, data,** and **users** that make it
up.]{.underline}]{.mark} To support cybersecurity policymaking, adjacent
fields also need consideration. Education, workforce management,
investment, entrepreneurship, and research and development are necessary
to get a product to market. Developers, law enforcement, intelligence,
incident response, and national defense are necessary to respond when
something goes awry in cyberspace.

### A2 C/I: Cybersecurity includes deterrence

#### Cybersecurity is deterrence through denial; distinct from deterrence through punishment.

#### Denning '16 **Denning, Dorothy; Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Defense Analysis. "Cybersecurity\'s next Phase: Cyber-Deterrence." The Conversation, 22 Dec. 2021, https://theconversation.com/cybersecuritys-next-phase-cyber-deterrence-67090. //kinsey**

[Cybersecurity aids deterrence]{.underline} primarily [through the
principle of denial]{.underline}. It stops attacks before they can
achieve their goals. This [includes beefing up login security,
encrypting data and communications, fighting viruses and other malware,
and keeping software updated to patch weaknesses]{.underline} when
they're found.

But even [more important is developing products that have few if any
security vulnerabilities when they are shipped and
installed]{.underline}. The Mirai botnet, capable of [generating massive
data floods that overload internet
servers](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/),
takes over devices that have gaping security holes, including [default
passwords hardcoded into
firmware](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/iot-device-maker-vows-product-recall-legal-action-against-western-accusers/) that
users can't change. [While some companies such
as ]{.underline}[Microsoft invest heavily in product
security](https://blogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/author/stevelipner/)[,
others, including many Internet-of-Things vendors, do not.]{.underline}

[Cybersecurity guru ]{.underline}[Bruce
Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/) aptly characterizes the prevalence
of insecure Internet-of-Things devices as a [market failure akin to
pollution](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/11/03/your-wifi-connected-thermostat-can-take-down-the-whole-internet-we-need-new-regulations/).
Simply put, [the market favors cheap insecure devices over ones that are
more costly but secure]{.underline}. His solution? Regulation[, either
by imposing basic security standards on manufacturers, or by holding
them liable when their products are used in attacks]{.underline}.

The security and defense policies of the Baltic states are strongly
influenced by the Russian aggression of
2014.[^[Footnote]{.underline}1^](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-419-8_7#Fn1) This
also holds true for NATO. The alliance has deployed around 4,500 troops
to Poland and the Baltic States since 2017. There is a large consensus
amongst academics and practitioners that this mission, labelled Enhanced
Forward Presence (eFP), should deter Russian aggression. However,
[t]{.underline}he [strategy]{.underline} to do so [remains highly
ambiguous and unclear]{.underline} (see also Running's chapter in this
volume). While many [official NATO documents]{.underline} as well as
observers simply [refer to the strategy as deterrence]{.underline},
others, either explicitly or implicitly, [distinguish
between *deterrence by
denial*]{.underline}[^[Footnote]{.underline}2^](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-419-8_7#Fn2)[ or *deterrence
by
punishment*]{.underline}*.*[^[Footnote]{.underline}3^](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-419-8_7#Fn3) The
[exact nature of the strategy can have far reaching consequences in
terms of allocation of resources, strategic communication, (perceived)
effectiveness as well as the very foundation of the alliance
itself]{.underline}: the trust of every ally that it is protected by
NATO in case of aggression.

Traditional deterrence theory presumes a rational actor perspective.
Over time the role of psychology and actor specific perceptions has
become more appreciated, in particular in the third wave in the
deterrence literature. Most of these [studies have focused]{.underline}
on the history of the [deterrent relationship and the nature of
signaling
behaviour]{.underline}.[^[Footnote]{.underline}4^](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-419-8_7#Fn4) However,
[although strategic culture has been widely acknowledged as an important
shaping factor of strategic
behaviour,]{.underline}[^[Footnote]{.underline}5^](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-419-8_7#Fn5)[ the
role of strategic culture has been largely ignored in deterrence
studies]{.underline}. This contribution aims to address this gap.
Specifically, this chapter focuses on how strategic culture influences
the Baltic countries' behavior towards deterrence.

While most of the literature analyses eFP from the perspective of NATO
or the troop contributing countries, this chapter addresses the question
how the host nations, i.e. in this contribution Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, perceive the strategy underlying eFP and their own
strategies. Given the fact that NATO's responses in the Baltics
post-2014 were also intended to be 'assurance measures', such a
perspective is important because [similar or diverging perspectives can
have far reaching consequences for NATO's strategy and its
credibility]{.underline}. We found that in Latvia official documents
reflect the official NATO narrative based on deterrence by punishment.
In Estonia and Lithuania, [documents, officials and experts emphasize
deterrence by denial as opposed or sometimes even parallel to deterrence
by punishment.]{.underline} To understand these tendencies, this
contribution contends that the respective strategic cultures of the host
nations influence their perspectives on the NATO's strategy. To that
end,
Sect. [7.2](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-419-8_7#Sec2) briefly
addresses the debate on deterrence and the different perspectives
observers take on the eFP mission.
Section [7.3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-419-8_7#Sec3) subsequently
introduces strategic culture theory as a lens to explain the
perspectives of the host nations.
Section [7.4](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-419-8_7#Sec4) outlines
the methods we used. We discuss the results in
Sect. [7.5](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-419-8_7#Sec5) and
provide a discussion and conclusions in
Sect. [7.6](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6265-419-8_7#Sec9).

#### OCO's are attack by punishment.

Turn off the lights in Moscow? This is just one of the possible uses of
offensive cyber operations (OCOs) briefed to the press by senior British
defence sources. Put simply, [OCOs 'project power to achieve military
objectives in, or through, cyberspace.' In everyday language, we are
talking about 'cyber attacks' -- from knocking websites offline to
disabling computers on a network, shutting down a power grid,
manipulating centrifuges in uranium enrichment facilities, or
undermining an adversary's air defences.]{.underline}

Over the last decade, the UK government has talked more openly about its
cyber capabilities. The latest step was the prime minister's [recent
avowal of the National Cyber Force
(NCF)](https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/technology-55007946), which has been
operational since April. Uncertainty remains, however, about [the role
of OCOs in wider UK strategy and how our political leaders are
navigating the complex choices involved in deciding when to use cyber
operations to secure national objectives]{.underline} and project
British values overseas. For example, should [OCOs]{.underline} only
[target an adversary's defence and security infrastructure,]{.underline}
or should the UK follow the contemporary trend in targeting civilian
infrastructure, as implied in the Moscow scenario briefed to the press?

### EXTRA STUFF:

### More definitions:

#### Cybersecurity is protection

**CISA 19.** *What Is Cybersecurity? \| CISA* \<\< government agency of
cyber security and infrastructure that is compromised of researchers and
experts hired through the bureaucratic process \>\>,

[Cybersecurity is the art of protecting networks, devices, and data from
unauthorized access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information]{.underline}. It seems that everything relies on computers
and the internet now---communication (e.g., email, smartphones,
tablets), entertainment (e.g., interactive video games, social media,
apps ), transportation (e.g., navigation systems), shopping (e.g.,
online shopping, credit cards), medicine (e.g., medical equipment,
medical records), and the list goes on. How much of your daily life
relies on technology? How much of your personal information is stored
either on your own computer, smartphone, tablet or on someone else\'s
system?

#### Security is protection which is different from prevention.

**Bacon n/d "**What Is Security?" \<\<QUALS\>\>, *SearchSecurity*,
<https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/security> Accessed

**[Security for information technology (IT) refers to the methods, tools
and personnel used to defend an organization\'s digital
assets.]{.underline} The [goal of IT security is to protect these
assets, devices and services from being disrupted, stolen or exploited
by unauthorized users, otherwise known as [threat
actors](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/threat-actor)]{.underline}.
These threats can be external or internal and malicious or accidental in
both origin and nature.**

**An effective [security strategy uses a range of approaches to minimize
vulnerabilities]{.underline} and target many types of cyberthreats.
Detection, prevention and response to security threats involve the use
of [security
policies](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/security-policy),
software tools and IT services.**

**Unfortunately, technological innovation benefits both IT defenders
and [cybercriminals](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/cybercrime).
To protect business assets, companies must routinely review, update and
improve security to stay ahead of cyberthreats and increasingly
sophisticated cybercriminals.**

**IT security consists of two areas: physical and information.**

**[Security is the protection of people, hardware, software, network
information and data from physical actions, intrusions and other events
that could damage an organization and its assets]{.underline}.
Safeguarding the physical security of a business means [protecting it
from threat actors, as well as accidents and natural disasters, such as
fires, floods, earthquakes and severe weather. A lack of physical
protection could risk the destruction of servers, devices and utilities
that support business operations and processes]{.underline}. That said,
people are a large part of the physical security threat.**

**Theft and vandalism are examples of human-initiated threats that
require physical security solutions. A physical security breach doesn\'t
necessarily require technical knowledge, but it can be just as dangerous
as a [data
breach](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/data-breach).**

### Protection vs. Prevention

#### Protection and prevention are distinct in the context of security.

**Invision Security 18**, \<\<security service information organization
\>\>, "Protection And Prevention. What Is The Difference?," *Invision
Security Group*, 05/29/2018,
<https://invisionsecuritygroup.com/protection-and-prevention-what-is-the-difference/>

[**Prevention** is the act of assessing a hazard in advance and taking
steps designed to lower its chances of happening. **Protection** is
safeguarding your company against threats you know you'll have to face
or are currently facing.]{.underline}

#### True in the context of [cybersecurity]{.underline} -- protection [must]{.underline} prevent an [existing threat]{.underline}. 

**Grinavich, \'20** -- Director of Engineered Solutions at Vector
Security (Jim Grinavich; \"Business Security: The Difference Between
Protection and Prevention\"; Vector Security;
https://www.vectorsecurity.com/blog/business-security-the-difference-between-protection-and-prevention;
1-23-2020, Accessed 6-25-2022)//ILake-NoC

[Prevention]{.underline} generally comes before protection and [is meant
to **avert the threat before it occurs**.]{.underline} An example of
prevention for business security includes a set of rules or reminders
about best safety practices for cyber security.

Protection is the next step and usually takes over if prevention fails.
[Protection is]{.underline} a combination of security equipment and
safety procedures [used to]{.underline} **[defend against and eliminate
threats]{.underline}**. A monitored fire alarm and subsequent emergency
evacuation plan are examples of quality protection.

Although **[prevention and protection are different]{.underline}**, use
both simultaneously to secure your business from possible threats.

particularly with Russia, to enable more effective communication and

between Russia and NATO members over the Ukraine crisis, are important
to strengthen processes for crisis management and reduce the risk of
instability---including that which may stem from cyber operations.

[[NATO has]{.underline}]{.mark} slowly begun to address the use of
offensive cyber operations, and has [generally [limited itself to the
use of these tools in traditional military
campaigns.]{.mark}]{.underline} The ongoing crisis with Russia on
Ukraine's border is exposing the risk in this approach. **[[NATO needs

The [use of force has been a contentious topic throughout U.S. history,
with the debate often split based **upon partisan lines** both in
**Congress** and in the **American public**.]{.underline} [The President
has ample authority,]{.underline} under both constitutional and
statutory law, [to use force in a range of offensive and defensive
scenarios]{.underline}-- subject to certain process and substantive
limitations. [There is also ample room for abuse through the
characterization of a covert activity]{.underline} as conduct that it is
not a clandestine operation or a TMA, [and by evasion of the Chief of
Mission's oversight. Offensive cyberspace operations **raise questions**
about whether such operations are intelligence or military activities,
whether operations are under the direction]{.underline} and control [of
civilians or uniformed military officers, whether the congressional
reporting is exclusively limited to the intelligence
committees]{.underline} or also includes the Armed Services committees,
[and whether there is coordination with the U.S. ambassadors serving
abroad]{.underline}. Indeed, effective oversight over covert actions,
both within the Executive branch and the Congress, is necessary to avoid
an adverse impact on U.S. foreign policy and important liaison
relationships, while promoting operational effectiveness and mitigating
a risk of abuse.
