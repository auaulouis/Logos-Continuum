[While claiming to "preserve peace," NATO has a history of bombing
civilians and committing war crimes]{.underline}. In 1999, [NATO engaged
in military operations without UN approval in Yugoslavia]{.underline}.
[Its illegal airstrikes during the Kosovo War left hundreds of civilians
dead.]{.underline} And far from the "North Atlantic," [NATO joined the
United States in invading Afghanistan]{.underline} in 2001, where it is
still bogged down two decades later. In 2011, [NATO forces illegally
invaded Libya, creating a failed state that caused masses of people to
flee.]{.underline} Rather than take responsibility for these refugees[,
NATO countries have turned back desperate migrants]{.underline} on the
Mediterranean Sea, [letting thousands die.]{.underline}

In London, [NATO wants to show it is ready to fight new
wars]{.underline}. It will showcase its readiness initiative---the
ability to deploy 30 battalions by land, 30 air squadrons and 30 naval
vessels in just 30 days, and to confront future threats from China and
Russia, including [with hypersonic missiles and
cyberwarfare.]{.underline} But far from being a lean, mean war machine,
[NATO is actually riddled with divisions and
contradictions]{.underline}. Here are some of them:

French President Emmanuel Macron questions the U.S. commitment to fight
for Europe, has called NATO "brain dead" and has proposed a European
Army under the nuclear umbrella of France.

Turkey has enraged NATO members with its incursion into Syria to attack
the Kurds, who have been Western allies in the fight against ISIS. And
Turkey has threatened to veto a Baltic defense plan until allies support
its controversial incursion into Syria. Turkey has also infuriated NATO
members, especially Trump, by purchasing Russia's S-400 missile system.

Trump wants [NATO]{.underline} to [push back against China's growing
influence]{.underline}, including the use of Chinese companies for the
construction of 5G mobile networks---[something many NATO countries are
unwilling to do.]{.underline}

Is Russia really NATO's adversary? France's Macron has reached out to
Russia, inviting Putin to discuss ways in which the European Union can
put the Crimean invasion behind it. Donald Trump has publicly attacked
Germany over its Nord Stream 2 project to pipe in Russian gas, but a
recent German poll saw 66 percent wanting closer ties with Russia. The
UK has bigger problems. Britain has been convulsed over the Brexit
conflict and is holding a contentious national election on December 12.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, knowing that Trump is wildly
unpopular, is reluctant to be seen as close to him. Also, Johnson's
major contender, Jeremy Corbyn, is a reluctant supporter of NATO. While
his Labour Party is committed to NATO, over his career as an anti-war
champion, Corbyn has called NATO "a danger to world peace and a danger
to world security." The last time Britain hosted NATO leaders in 2014,
Corbyn told an anti-NATO rally that the end of the Cold War "should have
been the time for NATO to shut up shop, give up, go home and go away." A
further complication is Scotland, which is home to a very unpopular
Trident nuclear submarine base as part of NATO's nuclear deterrent. A
new Labour government would need the support of the Scottish National
Party. But its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, insists that a precondition for
her party's support is a commitment to close the base. Europeans can't
stand Trump (a recent poll found he is trusted by only 4 percent of
Europeans!) and their leaders can't rely on him. Allied leaders learn of
presidential decisions that affect their interests via Twitter. The lack
of coordination was clear in October, when Trump ignored NATO allies
when he ordered U.S. special forces out of northern Syria, where they
had been operating alongside French and British commandos against
Islamic State militants.

[The U.S. unreliability has led the European Commission to draw up plans
for a European "defense union]{.underline}" that will coordinate
military spending and procurement. The next step may be to coordinate
military actions separate from NATO. [The Pentagon has complained about
EU countries purchasing military equipment from each other instead of
from the United States,]{.underline} and has called this defense union
"a dramatic reversal of the last three decades of increased integration
of the transatlantic defence sector."

Do Americans really want to go to war for Estonia? Article 5 of the
Treaty states that an attack against one member "shall be considered an
attack against them all," meaning that the treaty obligates the U.S. to
go to war on behalf of 28 nations---something most likely opposed by
war-weary Americans who want a less aggressive foreign policy that
focuses on peace, diplomacy, and economic engagement instead of military
force.

[An additional major bone of contention is who will pay for
NATO.]{.underline} The last time NATO leaders met, President Trump
derailed the agenda by berating NATO countries for not paying their fair
share, and at the London meeting, Trump is expected to announce symbolic
U.S. cuts to NATO's operations budget

Trump's main concern is that member states step up to the NATO target of
spending 2 percent of their gross domestic products on defense by 2024,
a goal that is unpopular among Europeans, who prefer that their tax
dollars go to nonmilitary items. Nevertheless, NATOSecretary-General
Jens Stoltenberg will brag that Europe and Canada have added \$100
billion to their military budgets since 2016---something Donald Trump
will take credit for---and that more NATO officials are meeting the 2
percent goal, even though a 2019 NATO report shows only seven members
have done so: the U.S., Greece, Estonia, the UK, Romania, Poland and
Latvia.

**[In an age where people around the world want to avoid war and to
focus instead on the climate chaos that threatens future life on earth,
NATO is an anachronism]{.underline}**. It now accounts for about
three-quarters of military spending and weapons dealing around the
globe. **[Instead of preventing war, it promotes militarism, exacerbates
global tensions and makes war more likely.]{.underline}** This Cold War
relic shouldn't be reconfigured to maintain U.S. domination in Europe,
or to mobilize against Russia or China, or to launch new wars in space.
**[It should not be expanded, but disbanded. Seventy years of militarism
is more than enough.]{.underline}**

#### NATO is a tool of imperialism and US heg -- disbandment key to peace 

**Wight 2022** (John Wight is an author and political commentator based
in Scotland, "NATO's disbandment is long overdue",
<https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2022/02/19/677115/NATO-disbandment-long-overdue-John-Wight>
)//MargaretE

The decisive role of NATO in achieving the West's objectives in the
former Yugoslavia need not detain us. The point is that today --
[bearing in mind NATO's role in the dismemberment of Yugoslavia, its
role in helping turn Afghanistan into a failed state, its critical role
in toppling Gadaffi in Libya and turning that country into a failed
state, and its stance in threatening Russia's security in Eastern
Europe]{.underline} -- **[it is no longer feasible or possible to harbor
any lingering belief that NATO is anything other than a tool of US hard
power, deployed not to protect and defend, but to destroy and
dominate.]{.underline}**

Whenever you hear Joe Biden and other leaders and officials of
NATO-member states advocating diplomacy to resolve the current crisis,
[it is notable that none advocate the one thing that would not only end
the current crisis and avert war in Ukraine, but do much to restore
stability and security to a world that has long been desperate for
both.]{.underline}

**[That one thing is NATO's immediate disbandment]{.underline}** and the
embrace of the principals enshrined in the UN Charter. Because if the
decades since the demise of the Soviet Union has confirmed on thing
above all others[, it is that the overriding challenge facing humanity
is not the lack of democracy within certain states, but the lack of
democracy between all states.]{.underline}

**[Until the latter is achieved the former will always remain the
product of the asphyxiating effects of imperialism and
hegemony.]{.underline}**

#### NATO obsolete -- causes more harm than good 

**Jacobs 2022** (Seth Jacobs is a history professor who studies the
political and cultural history of the U.S. in the 20th century. His
research focuses on the connection between U.S. domestic culture and
foreign policy, "On NATO",
<https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/sites/bc-magazine/summer-2022/features/new-world-order-/on-nato.html>
)//MargaretE

Three decades on, we are still stuck with the alliance, and as recent
events demonstrate, it is no laughing matter. **[NATO has become
obsolete]{.underline}**. Indeed, [Washington's whole Europe-first
orientation is anachronistic, a wasteful, expensive holdover from the
cold war that ought to have been abandoned years ago and that distracts
us from the true dangers we face abroad.]{.underline}

Mearsheimer, to his credit, deplored this development more vehemently
than anyone. A self-described "unrepentant realist," he had no patience
for the aggressive internationalism that defined Western statecraft in
the Clinton, Bush, and Obama presidencies. NATO as an anti-Soviet bloc
made sense to him; [NATO as an ever-expanding club of vaguely
like-minded nations was foolish---and dangerous.]{.underline} According
to the tenets of realism, [when one great power trespasses upon
another's sphere of influence, the result is nearly always
conflict]{.underline}, and Mearsheimer insisted that [that was the case
with NATO's eastward march.]{.underline} It did not matter that
officials from the United States and its European allies insisted that
they had no designs on Russia. [Russian President Vladimir Putin was not
convinced. He perceived their encroachment as an existential threat and
responded violently, first by annexing Crimea in 2014, then by invading
Ukraine in 2022.]{.underline} While most pundits in the West denounced
Putin's barefaced breach of international law, Mearsheimer proclaimed
that **[NATO was to blame]{.underline}**, that its leaders ought to have
recognized that their apparent intent to incorporate Russia's bordering
countries into their alliance would trigger war, and that Putin was only
doing what an American president would do if, say, Iran built a military
association and invited Mexico and Canada to join. In a
gauntlet-flinging guest essay for the Economist in March and a follow-up
interview in the New Yorker, Mearsheimer condemned NATO for naiveté and
called for a pragmatic solution to the crisis that would keep Ukraine as
a neutral country and leave Putin in power, with Crimea and the Donbas
in his grasp.

I am not a realist, repentant or otherwise, and I have problems with
Mearsheimer's glibness and moral relativism. Nonetheless, I agree with
him that **[NATO no longer serves a coherent purpose]{.underline}**.
[The principal geopolitical challenge to U.S. primacy in the 21st
century comes from China. That is where America's focus should
be.]{.underline} Russia might still qualify as a great power in terms of
boots on the ground, but its economy is one-dimensional and shot through
with corruption, its population shrinking and aging, its weapons and
equipment outmoded, and its troops demoralized. By no stretch of the
imagination could it overrun Europe as the old Soviet Union once seemed
capable of doing. Britain and France have nuclear weapons. They do not
need the United States to defend them. Why, then, does Washington
continue to station forces in Europe and bear most of the cost of this
transatlantic military partnership?

Institutional factors play a role, of course---NATO employs many
bureaucrats who have a stake in its preservation, and no business
dissolves itself voluntarily---but the main reason, in my opinion, is
[that Americans have yet to outgrow the delusions that prevailed
in]{.underline} what neoconservative columnist Charles Krauthammer
called [the "unipolar moment,"]{.underline} that heady time after the
cold war ended and no one appeared to threaten the security of the
United States. Flush with victory, [Washington policymakers believed
that they could use this period of unprecedented economic, military,
diplomatic, and geopolitical supremacy to remake the world in the
American image, and they thought NATO was the perfect vehicle for
accomplishing this goal]{.underline} on the Eurasian landmass. Thus they
changed NATO's original mandate and set about trying to foster liberal
democracies in new member states like Hungary, Estonia, Bulgaria, and
Slovakia. (Of course, the War on Terror saw this pattern extended to the
greater Middle East, as the George W. Bush administration sought to
democratize Afghanistan and Iraq.) A widely held assumption was that
increasing the number of liberal democracies would make war less likely,
since democracies do not fight one another. NATO aggrandizement would
therefore create a broad zone of peace from the Elbe River to the gates
of Russia, and perhaps beyond.

Events have not played out in that fashion. Far from nourishing
democracy, [NATO has seen the rise of far-right nationalist political
movements in four of its oldest and most powerful members---Britain,
Germany, France, and the United States]{.underline}---while Viktor
Orbán's second term as Hungarian prime minister witnessed an erosion of
press freedom, a decrease in judicial independence, and Hungary's
descent by eleven places on the Democracy Index. Similar democratic
backsliding has characterized Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's Turkey and Jaroslaw
Kaczynski's Poland[. As for being a force for peace, the carnage in
Ukraine serves as eloquent testimony to NATO's failure in this
regard.]{.underline} Mearsheimer's diagnosis of the origins of the
conflict may be wrong---Putin might have tried to integrate neighboring
nations into a greater Russia regardless of Western actions---but NATO
did nothing to halt his aggression. And, of course[, there is the
perennial free-riding problem, with America's allies counting on
Washington to protect them even if their economies are robust enough to
pay for their own defense]{.underline}. Moving NATO eastward has
increased the number of countries America is obliged to safeguard at a
time when a COVID-induced recession makes such commitments unaffordable.

Clearly, [NATO has outlived its usefulness to the United States**. The
Biden administration should disengage from the alliance as soon as
practicable.**]{.underline} This can be done diplomatically, with some
face-saving rhetoric and assurances that the departure of U.S. troops
will not adversely affect Euro-American investment or trade. We could
also remind nations like Spain and Turkey that they remain free to arm
themselves to the teeth with American-made weapons---provided, of
course, that they foot the bill. Then Washington should recalibrate its
grand strategy to conform to the changed global balance of power.

#### NATO is outdated, imperialistic, and interferes with the United Nations now -- it should be abolished to allow the UN to take its place

**Verma 3/8.** Sudesh, former journalist, he is a member of BJP's media
relations department and represents the party as spokesperson while
participating in television debates. "NATO has failed: UN must be
strengthened"
https://thedailyguardian.com/nato-has-failed-un-must-be-strengthened/

T[he Russian military intervention in Ukraine has exposed the world's
inability to control the situation if a powerful State decides to use
its military power]{.underline} to set things right [with its immediate
neighbouring countries. The prime reason for this massive failure is the
absence of a moral and righteous world body that has the mechanism to
implement dharma-based order. NATO clearly does not fit the bill.The
only organisation that could do this is the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations [but it has got weakened due
to shadow boxing by major world powers]{.underline}---the Big Five that
includes [the US, the UK, France]{.underline}, China and Russia. They
trust their own military strength and have no reason to strengthen the
UN. The [veto enjoyed by them ensures that **this body remains defunct
to prevent any major crisis** involving any of these
players.]{.underline} All these five have developed sophisticated
weaponry and are major suppliers of arms across the world. [NATO cannot
replace the UN since it is a group of countries having a **vested
interest to empower itself** and maintain superiority]{.underline}
vis-a-vis other countries. [The world does not matter to NATO countries
if they are not involved in acts of war with non-NATO
countries]{.underline}. And if push comes to shove NATO can fight any
country or grouping in the world based on its combined military strength
and economic might. At least NATO would like to believe this.The [fact
that three permanent members of the UN Security with veto are members of
the NATO---France, the UK and the US---makes it evident that the
organisation seeks to be happy with its own enclave]{.underline} where
they would enjoy liberty, freedom and democracy [and]{.underline} will
[also have the wherewithal to fight others if these are
hurt.]{.underline} Even [in the vastly interdependent and integrated
world, NATO believes that it can live peacefully even if other countries
suffer]{.underline}. The UN has 193 members which means that 163
countries are outside the NATO framework.

[Becoming a member of NATO brings in security plus economic
empowerment]{.underline}. Actually, [the strategy of the British Empire
where the military back-up by the Crown was used to further business
interests has been emulated by NATO.]{.underline} NATO would intervene
if its economic interest is hurt or if it concludes that certain actions
of any country are hurting its core held principles. The massive
airpower would ensure that NATO troops would not even need to be on the
ground if it desires to punish a country. The [control over English
media by NATO countries]{.underline} both in terms of finance,
governmental control and ideology [would ensure that a larger legitimacy
is provided to its actions.]{.underline} [The US intervention in
Afghanistan was justified as much as its withdrawal that happened after
two decades]{.underline}. The US intervened in Iraq to destroy weapons
of mass destruction but when it did not find any, it blamed intelligence
failure. [The UN has been **relegated to providing legitimacy to the
course of action decided by NATO**. These NATO countries **have enough
clout because of their influence** and are able to lobby successfully at
the UN and get the support of smaller countries]{.underline} to add to
their legitimacy.

[One wonders why was NATO not disbanded with the collapse of the Warsaw
Pact]{.underline}---a military alliance of former communist countries
with the erstwhile USSR as the fulcrum. [Both the Warsaw Pact and the
NATO were offshoots of the Cold war and hence when the Warsaw Pact was
dissolved in 1991, NATO should have followed the same course. On the
contrary, NATO expanded by inducting former Soviets into
it.]{.underline} [**NATO creates an unequal world and undermines the
credibility of the UN**.]{.underline} If other countries start emulating
the example of NATO and create their own separate military alliances,
this would be an end to the existence of the UN. This would also create
fertile ground for tension all across the globe. The world would be
divided into exclusive economic and military blocs. [Ukraine should
serve as a lesson to NATO that it cannot do anything in a war-like
situation with a powerful country.]{.underline} Some members of NATO are
now realising that economic sanctions are going to hurt their own
interests more than the interest of Russia. [Had NATO not given false
confidence to Ukraine and provoked it to seek NATO membership, the
present crisis could have been avoided.]{.underline} You can appreciate
the security concerns of other countries only when you understand the
vulnerabilities. If you are strongly protected by the umbrella of a
powerful security alliance you would not feel the pinch. [Ukraine was
the best as a buffer country between Russia and Western Europe. When
Ukraine was forced to abandon its nuclear arsenals all the powers had
ensured that it would stay safe and secure and the world would stand
guarantee to its neutrality.]{.underline} Sending arms to that country
and trying to influence it to become a member of the European Union and
then NATO was a violation of that charter.[Russian intervention in
Ukraine cannot be justified in today's world and any issue of
provocation must be resolved through dialogues. But when **unbiased
history would be written about this crisis**, one would not be able to
ignore the fact that Russian **overtures to talks were spurned by an
overconfident NATO**]{.underline} led by the US. Was it not provoked to
use its military might to set things right from Russia's perspective?
 NATO must ponder over this. The high-sounding words trying to bulldoze
Russian President Vladimir Putin have proved to be hollow. NATO cannot
get into direct war with Russia since the threat of nuclear weapons
poses threat to the entire humanity.

[The need for a stronger UN was never felt more acutely than it is
today.]{.underline} Panic gripped the world when on 4 March, the Russian
military fired at the power units of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power
Plant---the largest nuclear facility in Europe. Energoatom which
operates nuclear plants in Ukraine appealed to the world community
saying that heavy shelling at the nuclear plants was "a severe violation
of nuclear and radiation safety which can lead to hard and tragic
consequences for the whole world!" The world had woken up to the warning
that it could witness a tragedy worst than that of Chernobyl. Those who
may have forgotten must know what Chernobyl disaster a nuclear accident
that happened on 26 April 1984 during a routine checking at one of the
nuclear plants at Chernobyl. This generated more radioactive radiation
than the two bombs that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

Chernobyl and areas around it were evacuated and largescale relocation
of the population took place in affected areas. The radiation led to
people getting various diseases, particularly thyroid cancer. An area of
30 sq km around the plant is now made an exclusion zone where people
cannot visit. Close to 150,000 Sq Kms of land area in Belarus, Russia,
and Ukraine were supposed to have been contaminated. Has the world
evolved any mechanism to take care of such eventualities? You can blame
one country or the other for the tragedy but who will be responsible for
the largescale death and devastation resulting from this no gain blame
game. Who is responsible for the death and destruction in Ukraine? The
US, NATO or Russia? Or is it the entire world that failed to take
corrective action in time?

[Whether a war or economic sanctions, the result is the same. The common
people who have no role suffer the most.]{.underline} If we call
ourselves civilised why can't we evolve a strong mechanism for peaceful
resolution of disputes? There are few hotspots of the world and
immediate attention must be given to them so that rival territorial
claims do not become a reason for military conquest.

[The UN is the **only institution that promises hope**. A larger role to
the UN means that all military alliances or such pacts between countries
**must be dismantled**.]{.underline} [The UN must be strengthened to use
force too if and when needed---not only for peacekeeping but also for
bringing an errant country to sense.]{.underline} [One factor that has
made the UN almost non-functional in matters of such conflict is the
power of the veto.]{.underline} Why should any country have a veto?

The [permanent membership of the UN Security Council **must be expanded
to make the UN more representative**.]{.underline} [The UN charter needs
to be redrafted to **take care of modern threats to world peace**
including cyberwar.]{.underline} [Instead of veto by one member, the
decision should be taken by a decisive majority.]{.underline} This would
ensure that every member would be scared of being on the wrong side.
[Like on the pattern of NATO, the UN can have its permanent force parked
in various countries to be drafted in times of need.]{.underline} And
[what is the point of having nuclear weapons if you cannot use them? So,
there should be complete disarmament and destruction of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. For energy linked nuclear power plants, there
should be a strong UN presence so that these are safe and secure. [This
is not impossible to achieve if everyone realises the futility of war
and a permanent resolution to possible conflicts are found]{.underline}
out.

[Rather than a few regional satraps trying to emerge as saviour of
humanity, the UN should aspire for this role]{.underline}. If action is
taken after full justification in the right spirit to establish dharma,
nobody would complain. This would mean establishing a supranational
government to ensure that there is no violation of territorial integrity
or violation of established rules.

#### NATO credibility hurts the Global South and wrecks chances for success

That's a problem,

)//MargaretE

[It is assumed that good times will continue to roll for the
military-industrial complexes of Europe]{.underline}, as [countries rush
to grow their
arsenals](https://declassifieduk.org/does-the-ukraine-war-mean-britain-should-increase-military-spending/)
with the latest kit, even if the abject failure of the Russia armed
forces hardly suggests that bigger budgets are needed. [Not everything
fits neatly into place, though, and two very troubling issues lie
ahead]{.underline}. The first is that in the past two decades, [NATO has
been anything but a success]{.underline}. [In Afghanistan, it was in
charge of the [International Security Assistance
Force](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_69366.htm)]{.underline}
from 2003 to 2014 and then the smaller, non-combat force, 'Resolute
Support Mission', from 2015 [through to the end of the disastrous war
last year.]{.underline} In 2011, [Libya was another NATO failure, where
the bloc was said to be involved in a humanitarian intervention but
ended up overseeing regime change, leaving a failed state in its
wake.]{.underline} Beyond these, though, is the much bigger issue: [NATO
is well-nigh irrelevant when it comes to the main global security
challenges, climate breakdown and the widening socioeconomic
divide.]{.underline} Africans support the Ukrainian people, but
centuries of experience also make us wary of 'solutions' by our former
colonisers. [We are currently seeing an impact of the [lethal heatwave
right across South
Asia](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/18/asia/climate-india-pakistan-heatwave-intl/index.html).]{.underline}
Records are being broken daily but the remarkable thing that sets this
apart from other serious heatwaves is that it is happening [far earlier
in the
season](https://www.vox.com/23057267/india-pakistan-heat-wave-climate-change-coal-south-asia)
than would be expected. [We are also seeing warnings of [an impending
global food
crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/ukraine-war-has-stoked-global-food-crisis-that-could-last-years-says-un),
stemming in part from climate factors but also fuelled by market impacts
of the Ukraine war]{.underline}. As in the world food crisis of the
1970s, though, it is also down to socioeconomic factors. Now, as then,
there are enough grain reserves to go around, but hundreds of millions
of people simply cannot afford to pay the soaring prices. [Both the
heatwave and the food crisis are early signs of what is to come if
economic reform and radical decarbonisation are not implemented, and
they mean that we are heading for a deeply unstable and insecure
world.]{.underline} If the Ukraine war does end soon, [NATO will emerge
as an increasingly strong and confident alliance, yet it will be close
to irrelevant when it comes to the real global challenges.]{.underline}
More than that, [given its performance in Afghanistan and Libya, NATO
will be seen increasingly as a negative influence across the Global
South, an alliance dominated by white Western states committed to
protecting their own security.]{.underline} [An earlier
column](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/russia-ukraine-joe-biden-west-hypocrisy-war/)
commented on the attitude to the Ukraine war in lower-income countries,
with tepid support for the West mixed with a 'plague on both your
houses' mood. If NATO is to be relevant in a fractured world, it will
have to evolve very quickly into a different kind of alliance. This must
be part of a global transformation of understanding about security that
is becoming more and more urgent. It is a lot to hope for, but [if NATO
doesn't change, it won't just be irrelevant, **it will be an increasing
part of the problem.**]{.underline}

### withdrawal = collapse 

#### US Withdrawal causes NATO collapse -- follow on 

**Monov 2019** (Lyubomir Monov works for the ministry in defense in
Sofia, Bulgaria, "NATO Under Pressure",
https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1702&context=jss
)//MargaretE

[Are there any scenarios for dissolution of NATO?]{.underline} Peter
Schwartz and Doug Randall consider this question in their essay "Ahead
of the Curve: Anticipating Strategic Surprise". They insist than in the
future the fundamental strategic interests of the US and Europe will
diverge. The Americans will not be willing to pay billions for the
protection of rich European countries. The Europeans will refrain from
participating in peacekeeping operations in places such Africa. Europe's
main goal will be to deter the rising power of America. [The United
States will withdraw their forces from Europe. The United Kingdom is
suspicious of its continental allies and generally follows the United
States. Consequently, without America and Great Britain, NATO will
collapse.]{.underline} 24 The collapse of NATO may be a sequential
result from several correlated events. They might include partisan
actions from the U.S. leadership and responses from the European states
that will increase political and military disparity. For instance, [a
reason for possible dissolution of NATO could be the difference between
America\'s national interests and those of the European allies
especially with regard to military interventions outside the
Euro-Atlantic area. America is likely to feel frustrated by the lack of
reciprocity, considering the fact that during the last seventy years the
United States invested enormous funds in the reconstruction of the
European continent.]{.underline} Americans might have some additional
disappointments based on the probability that European partners will
delay or will not implement the commitment to provide 2 percent of their
GDP to mutual defense. Consequently, the probable European failure to
commit to the common security may increase the financial responsibility
and may raise the military burden on the United States. The latter may
increase the level of dissatisfaction with NATO from U.S. citizens. The
possibility of a continued lack of European investment in the area of
defense will widen the technological gap and will affect the ability of
Allied Forces to act as one entity. Conceived in this way, these factors
combined with the traditional American rhetoric about isolationism may
lead to the withdrawal of the United States from NATO. [Canada without
the American military machine will not be able to ensure the
survivability of the transatlantic link, which means the effective
disintegration of NATO]{.underline}. 25 Richard Jordan from the
conservative website the Federalist asserts that the Alliance will
crumble slowly and gradually. The author claims [the world no longer
needs the Cold War's NATO.]{.underline} Furthermore, he insists that
NATO has had a privilege to behave irrationally, there are no reasons
for its existence, and there is no force, which might transform it.
Nowadays the world is in a different paradigm--America is not willing to
pay any price and bear any burden. The current Administration sees the
world through the prism of realism, which general assumption is that
each party acts only in their own narrow interests. Since the United
States has a number of domestic political differences and external
economic concerns, Washington does not want to invest resources and
efforts to subsidize the luxurious European lifestyle. In five to ten
years, the writer proclaims, Europe will experience a crisis, which
Europeans will not manage to solve. In addition, Jordan thinks that,

The problem comes when pollsters dig a bit deeper. The [central feature
of any military alliance is that all members come to the aid of one
another in case of attack. That [unified stance]{.mark} --- collective
defense]{.underline} in strategic parlance --- [is what [makes the
alliance credible]{.mark}.]{.underline} [If one or more parties won't
defend other members, the whole enterprise falls apart.]{.underline}
Indeed, [that is what many [European]{.mark} [leaders]{.mark}
[fear]{.mark} as [the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan]{.mark} [raises
questions about its ability to live up to]{.mark} its
[commitments]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Whether that fear is justified or not, the fact is that [[majorities
in]{.mark} most [European nations]{.mark} already [oppose]{.mark} the
[use of their troops to]{.mark} [aid]{.mark} [a NATO
ally]{.mark}.]{.underline} That startling finding comes from a February
2020 Pew Research poll. The survey asked respondents [from 16 NATO
nations]{.underline} whether that nation should use military force to
defend a NATO ally in a serious military conflict with Russia.
[Majorities of only five]{.underline} nations --- [the United States,
Britain, Canada, the Netherlands and Lithuania --- answered yes.
Pluralities or majorities in every other nation surveyed opposed coming
to the ally's assistance]{.underline}, with opposition rising to 60
percent among Germans.

One might wonder why NATO is viewed favorably given this response, but
another question from the 2020 poll provides clarity. [The same people
were also asked whether they thought the United States would use
military force to aid a NATO ally under attack by Russia. Majorities or
pluralities in every European nation surveyed said it would, with
percentages rising above 70 percent in Italy, Spain and
Britain.]{.underline} [Many [Europeans]{.mark} clearly [believe]{.mark}
that [NATO]{.mark} is [a **device to ensure U.S. protection**]{.mark}
for them [rather]{.mark} [than]{.mark} [a collective alliance]{.mark}
whereby all support all.]{.underline} This underlying belief might be a
reason [only 10 of NATO's 30 members currently meet the alliance's
target of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product on
defense]{.underline} each year.

This finding alone is troubling, but another poll points to other
worrisome signs. [[The]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
increasingly [views China as]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n existential
[threat]{.mark}. This is why it is [shifting military resources]{.mark}
[to the Pacific]{.mark} theater to combat China's rise]{.underline} and
[working to persuade U.S. allies to resist Chinese efforts to make those
nations' economies dependent upon Chinese consumers and
companies.]{.underline} This means that [NATO allies will increasingly
be asked to shoulder some of the burden in a de facto anti-Chinese
alliance at the same time as NATO itself deploys against
Russia.]{.underline}

Europeans do not want to do that. A January 2021 poll from the European
Council on Foreign Relations found [[60 percent of Europeans
want]{.mark} [their nation to remain neutral]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}ny [conflict between China]{.mark} [and the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline} The poll also found that
59 percent of those surveyed believe that China will be more powerful
than the United States in a decade; only 19 percent vouched for
continued U.S. supremacy. Finally, [67 percent said that Europe could
not always rely on the United States and had to look after its own
defense. Each of these trends points to electorates that won't back the
United States in the conflict that U.S. leaders]{.underline} of both
parties [see as most important.]{.underline}

None of this is written in stone. [European leaders could try to
persuade their voters of the enduring value of a strong, global, Western
alliance]{.underline}. [Barring that, however, [Europe]{.mark}an leaders
[will]{.mark} [likely]{.mark} continue to follow their voters,
[underinvest]{.mark}ing [in defense]{.mark} and avoiding the strong
anti-China stances U.S. leaders want]{.underline}. [If that happens,
[presidents]{.mark} from both parties [will]{.mark} likely]{.underline}
regretfully [[conclude]{.mark} [that]{.mark} substantial [European
military involvement no longer serves American
interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} Europe's worst nightmare would thus
become true more because of its own inclinations than because of
American fecklessness.

#### NATO's in decline now -- authoritarianism and disagreements fracture the alliance BUT there's no way to fix them

**Ellehuus and Morcos 21.** Rachel, Pierre, "NATO SHOULD FINALLY TAKE
ITS VALUES SERIOUSLY"
https://warontherocks.com/2021/06/nato-should-take-its-values-seriously/
JH-NCP

The Threat from Within

[Over the past decade, [several]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} [allies]{.mark}
[have taken a turn]{.mark} **[away from democracy]{.mark}**.
[Hungary]{.mark} and [Poland]{.mark} are sliding into illiberalism,
while the rule of law has long since unraveled in [Turkey]{.mark}.
In [Greece]{.mark} and [Slovenia]{.mark}, press freedom is rapidly
deteriorating.]{.underline} NATO's newest members made substantial
progress since the end of the Cold War, but [[democracy remains fragile
in Montenegro, Albania, and North Macedonia]{.mark}. As a result,
internal corruption or malign influence could readily unleash new
instability.]{.underline}

From the beginning, [[NATO]{.mark} has [faced tension]{.mark}s [over how
much emphasis to put on democratic values]{.mark}.]{.underline} On one
hand, [NATO has always been more than just a military alliance. Its
strength and resilience have long derived from the shared commitment of
allies to the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty. The preamble to
this document stresses democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of
law while its second article explicitly commits to "peaceful and
friendly international relations."]{.underline}

But the alliance has not always lived up to these ideals. In the late
1960s and early 1970s, NATO debated how to deal with authoritarianism in
Portugal and Greece as well as multiple coups in Turkey. Ultimately,
members decided not to address the problem, instead
prioritizing cohesion and geopolitical interests during a tense Cold War
period. As explained by then-National Security Adviser Walt Rostow,
"\[T\]he time has come to separate our NATO relationship from our
disapproval of domestic Greek politics."

This was the wrong choice then and an even worse one today. [The risks
of ignoring NATO's internal strains far outweigh the benefits of
addressing them.]{.underline} Some of the reasons are longstanding[: [A
country's treatment of its]{.mark} own [citizens
reflects]{.mark}]{.underline}, positively or negatively, [[on NATO's
brand]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} an [unstable domestic
environment]{.mark} [inhibits that country's ability to meet its
international obligations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Today, though, [ignoring democratic decline carries **new risks**.
[NATO's]{.mark} [adversaries]{.mark} have become increasingly skilled at
[tak]{.mark}ing [advantage]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}, in some cases, actively [exacerbating countries'
[societal vulnerabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} [A compromised media
environment allows disinformation campaigns to flourish,
while corruption opens space for Russian networks to]{.underline}
operate and [gain influence.]{.underline} [M[oscow is also
preying]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the [grievances of]{.mark} racial and ethnic
[minorities in NATO member countries]{.mark}]{.underline} in order [to
weaken national-level governance and cohesion.]{.underline}

In this context, [[democratic decline]{.mark} has **[empowered]{.mark}
the [leaders]{.mark} [of some NATO states]{.mark}** [to take
self-serving decisions]{.mark} **[at the expense of the
alliance]{.mark}'s collective interests**. In both Turkey and Hungary,
for example, [hypernationalism]{.mark} and corrupt ties with Russia have
led to decisions that have [compromised]{.mark} [NATO
decision-making]{.mark} and weakened the alliance's military
readiness.]{.underline} [[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark} recently
[[acquired]{.mark} [a Russian]{.mark} S-400 [missile
system]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [which can undermine NATO's
integrated air defense, and then [launched]{.mark} [an invasion
of]{.mark} northeast [Syria]{.mark} that endangered NATO countries'
forces]{.underline} on the ground. More recently, [Turkey also blocked a
defense plan for the Baltic states and Poland on the grounds that NATO
did not sufficiently support its war against Kurdish separatist forces.
[Hungary]{.mark} has helped hamstring NATO]{.underline}, as well. In
2019, [Budapest [blocked Ukraine's]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}
[M]{.mark}embership [A]{.mark}ction [P]{.mark}lan and canceled meetings
of the NATO-Ukraine Commission over a bilateral dispute regarding Kiev's
treatment of the country's ethnically Hungarian minority.]{.underline}

When Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg appointed experts to examine
NATO's future, they noted that [a "drift toward NATO disunity ... must
be seen as a strategic rather than merely tactical or optical
problem.]{.underline}" To date, [allies have lacked the political will
or legal instruments to effectively address in-house tensions and
divergences.]{.underline} The European Union can theoretically address
democratic backsliding through its rule of law mechanism and
conditionality on its funding. [[NATO]{.mark}, by contrast, [has
no]{.mark} legal [provisions]{.mark} [fo]{.mark}r suspending or
[expelling an ally that violates]{.mark} [the alliance's]{.mark}
founding [principles]{.mark} [and no]{.mark} financial [carrots that
might incentivize good behavior.]{.mark}]{.underline}

NATO was founded in April of 1949. [NATO was formed as a counterweight
to the growing political and military power of the then Soviet Union.
From 1949 until the fall of the Soviet Union, the purpose of NATO had
been to prevent an invasion of Western Europe]{.underline} by the Soviet
Union. [With the collapse of the Soviet Union in October of 1991 the
rationale behind NATO rendered the organization moot.]{.underline} Yet,
like all large bureaucracies, NATO lived on.

The main impetus that the United States became involved in NATO had been
the threat of communism. [With the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the
subsequent fall of communism worldwide as a threat against the
capitalistic United States, the new economic, political and military
situation no longer justifies the expenditure of funds and military
resources by the United States]{.underline} as was necessary during the
Cold War.

[In]{.underline} [1949 the United States identified its economic,
political and national security interests as being aligned with
Europe]{.underline}. It's 2020 and [the]{.underline} [interests of the
United States are not so much in Europe anymore. [The]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, since the Obama
administration, [[has]{.mark} [been diverting its attention]{.mark} and
military resources [to Asia and]{.mark} its [concern]{.mark} [with the
rise of China]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[With]{.underline}]{.mark} the
political and economic independence of [[Europe no longer being]{.mark}
such [a chief concern]{.mark} of the United States, the eventual
[withdrawal]{.mark} [of the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[from NATO is **only a matter of time**]{.mark}. Indeed, Europe is
looked upon in many quarters in the United States more as a competitor
than as an ally.]{.underline}

The economic, political and national security interests of Europe and
the United States are no longer the same.

[[Since]{.mark} [the fall of the Soviet Union]{.mark}, [NATO]{.mark}
[has been in search of a reason for its existence]{.mark}. The terrorist
attack on the United States on [September 11]{.mark}, 2001, for a time,
[gave the organization a new]{.mark} [lease on life]{.mark}, but with
the]{.underline} United States coming to an [agreement with the Taliban,
this reason]{.underline} will soon be [gone as well.]{.underline} [With
the United States becoming increasingly preoccupied with China, there is
a growing feeling]{.underline} in the Trump administration [that NATO is
no longer a burden the United States should have to bear.]{.underline}

[There are several reasons that NATO is breaking down. [The]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has become]{.mark} increasingly
[exasperated by the refusal of]{.mark} the majority of [NATO countries
to]{.mark}]{.underline} shoulder their fair share of the economic burden
of NATO. Each NATO member is required to [[contribute]{.mark} a minimum
of 2 percent per annum [to the NATO budget]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet,
[since the end of the Cold War]{.underline} many nations have failed to
contribute the two percent requirement, with [only seven of the
twenty-nine members meeting this requirement.]{.underline} In 2019,
France only contributed 1.82 percent of its GDP, with Germany coming in
at 1.23 percent, which is virtually unchanged since 2014. The United
States has long complained of the European members of NATO not meeting
their financial obligations, but the Trump administration has gone
further than complain. The Trump administration has reduced the
contributions of the United States to the level of contributions made by
Germany. President Trump has made no secret of his belief that NATO is
no longer a viable entity and his belief that the United States should
withdraw from the alliance.

The [ongoing [controversy]{.mark} of Europe [allowing]{.mark} the
Chinese telecom giant [Huawei to build a 5G network]{.mark}]{.underline}
in Europe has also [[increased tensions]{.mark} between the United
States and Europe. The United States and China have begun a geopolitical
war]{.underline}, with both sides jockeying for advantage on the world
scene. [Huawei, which has over \$75 billion in subsidies from the
Chinese government, has been accused by the United States of being an
agent for Chinese intelligence and has installed spyware in its
equipment]{.underline} which would allow Chinese intelligence of
obtaining crucial technology by stealth, and to obtain human
intelligence on all users of Huawei technology. [Europe, [despite strong
pressure from the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, has moved
forward in allowing Huawei to develop 5G technology in Europe. France
has gone so far as to allow Huawei to establish a manufacturing plant in
France.]{.underline}

Russia has begun construction on the Nord Stream gas pipeline which will
carry natural gas from Russia to Europe. With Europe already receiving
40 percent of its natural gas from Russia, the United States is
concerned that too much reliance on this energy source would leave
Europe subject to geopolitical pressure in any confrontation between
Russia and the West. While Nord Stream Two is currently on hold due to
economic pressure from the United States, eventually this natural gas
pipeline will be finished, and the amount of natural gas exports from
Russia to Europe will double. Russia expects to finish Nord Stream Two
in the first quarter of 2021.

[In an ominous sign of the differences between the main powers of the EU
and the United States]{.underline}, both [[France and Germany ruled out
purchasing]{.mark} the American made [F-35]{.mark}]{.underline} to
replace the aging European fighter, the Tornado.

[[With the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates withdrawing from
being the police]{.underline}~~man~~ [of the world commons, and its
determination to [pivot]{.mark} from Europe [to Asia]{.mark}, [the
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} which has lasted since 1949, [[is coming
to an end]{.mark}. The United States]{.underline} under the Trump
administration [does not consider the alliance to be in the economic,
political or national security interests of the United
States.]{.underline} There have been rumors that if President Trump is
re-elected than the United States will withdraw from NATO in the early
stages of a second Trump term.

#### NATO's fracturing -- spending, beef with Turkey, and American dominance all cause friction

**Kulikov 20.** Valery, "NATO in danger of falling apart"

However, a [significant number of [European]{.mark} [politicians]{.mark}
today [are]{.mark} more [inclined to reduce the]{.mark} [military
budget]{.mark} [of their countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially
given the current financial and economic problems. In addition, [an
increasing number of politicians (especially in the Baltics) who
recently started to actively offer their countries for the deployment of
American troops]{.underline}, naturally at the expense of 'American
security guarantees', [see in this an opportunity to reduce their
national military spending and to transfer budget funds to other
domestic expenses instead.]{.underline} Thus, according to err.ee., an
Estonian information resource, the Minister of Finance of the country
Martin Helme (Conservative People's Party, EKRE) recently proposed to
cut the state's military spending by € 50 million.

[Alliances and security guarantees were once viewed as the most serious
obligations a state can undertake. Today, however, [Washington]{.mark}
[is handing out security guarantees]{.mark} [like]{.mark} a hotel
administrator --- **[candy]{.mark} to its guests**: everybody gets one,
plus an extra piece to anyone who asks for it.]{.underline} However, it
is believed that such obligations are worthless, notes The National
Interest.

And this circumstance was confirmed in light of recent events in the
Eastern Mediterranean and the attitude of the alliance countries to the
policies and actions of Turkey. As a result of Ankara's recent actions,
[[Turkey]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [made its presence]{.mark} felt
[from]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [Middle East]{.mark} [to the]{.mark} Eastern
[Mediterranean and]{.mark} North [Africa]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} has
[increased]{.mark} the [risk of confrontation]{.mark} and friction
[within NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Since early summer, [after the contradictions [arose in relation to the
conflict in Libya]{.mark}]{.underline}, which reached the level of
aggressive actions undertaken by the crews of the warships of the
Turkish and French navies, [mutual claims of the two countries
intensified.]{.underline} [They then escalated further over the
manoeuvres that the French undertook]{.underline} jointly with the
Greeks and [Cypriots in the Eastern Mediterranean. As a result, Ankara
accused Paris of violating the agreements on military presence in
Cyprus]{.underline}, stepping up its manoeuvres in the Eastern
Mediterranean region in response. After that, [the French
president]{.underline}, commenting on the situation, [said that the
actions of Turkey 'are not like the actions of a NATO ally', and added
that Turkey has been acting this way for several years, ignoring allied
relations within the framework of the North Atlantic
Alliance.]{.underline}

Recently, [a sharp [deterioration in relations between Turkey]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} another NATO member, [[Greece]{.mark}, [due to
gas deposits]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [the disputed Mediterranean]{.mark}
region, has been added to the contradictions between Turkey and France.
The conflict continues to escalate, dividing Europe into two
camps.]{.underline}

But [[it]{.mark} [turned out to]{.mark} [be difficult for the alliance
to resolve]{.mark} [the internal crisis]{.mark}, as it always withdrew
from solving Turkish problems.]{.underline} Against the backdrop of the
risk of a military escalation between NATO members, its Secretary
General Jens [Stoltenberg has so far limited himself to calls for
'dialogue' and 'de-escalation.' And the members of the [alliance]{.mark}
[do not show unity]{.mark} in assessing Ankara's actions]{.underline},
which, in particular, is evidenced by the [refusal of 22 out of 30 NATO
members to support France's demand to take a more firm position on
Ankara.]{.underline}

A potential conflict, the likelihood of which at the moment is high
enough, indicates that [NATO is going through far from the best times.
One can get the impression that the NATO leadership is either openly
disregarding the interests of the European allies]{.underline}, who are
already ready to take up arms, [or]{.underline} Brussels is [following
the secret instructions of Washington]{.underline}, [which intends to
benefit from Europe weakened by a potential war.]{.underline}

JH-NCP

President Trump continued his criticism of NATO Tuesday before he headed
to Europe for a meeting of leaders of the 29-nation alliance Wednesday,
trading barbed tweets with European Council President Donald Tusk. The
testy exchange was further evidence that the president is right when he
says that NATO -- created in 1949 -- has become obsolete.

The U.S. president understands one of the great cardinal rules of
geopolitics that others seem to have forgotten: [no alliance lasts
forever. After almost 70 years, America and its NATO partners in Europe
may be heading for a new relationship, while still remaining
friends.]{.underline}

In an early morning tweet Tuesday, President Trump wrote: "Getting ready
to leave for Europe. First meeting - NATO. [The U.S. is spending many
times more than any other country in order to protect them. Not fair to
the U.S. taxpayer. On top of that we lose \$151 Billion on Trade with
the European Union. Charge us big Tariffs (& Barriers)!"]{.underline}

And in another tweet President Trump wrote: "[NATO countries must pay
MORE, the United States must pay LESS. Very Unfair!"]{.underline}

Tusk responded with a tweet of his own: "Dear \@realDonaldTrump. US
doesn't have and won't have a better ally than EU. We spend on defense
much more than Russia and as much as China. I hope you have no doubt
this is an investment in our security, which cannot be said with
confidence about Russian & Chinese spending."

[History teaches us obvious reasons for the breakup of alliances.
Circumstances and threats change. One country's mortal enemy one day
could be the nation's best friend the next. Just look back at World War
II -- our enemies Germany, Japan and Italy are our allies today. Our
ally Russia (part of the Soviet Union back then) is our
adversary.]{.underline}

[There is only one constant when it comes to smart foreign policy. A
nation seeks allies and partnership where it has common interests.
Sometimes those alliances lose their value or importance over time and
break up.]{.underline}

[NATO was formed to defend against the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact
allies. But the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact died in 1991 -- and
NATO's original mission died then as well.]{.underline} Soviet tanks are
no longer primed to head into Europe to conquer our NATO partners. [NATO
is now a world-class military alliance looking for a
mission.]{.underline}

[**China is the national security challenge of our time**. Russia does
not even come close.]{.underline}

To be clear, Moscow is certainly a dangerous adversary. Its occupation
and annexation of Crimea -- thanks to its growing military might -- as
well as brutal chemical weapons attacks on British soil prove a rogue
Russia needs to be deterred and confronted if need be.

But [today's Russia is not the superpower threat that the Soviet Union
was. Over the long-term, demographic issues, economic stagnation and
questions of who succeeds]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin
clearly ensure Moscow is not the boogeyman it once was.]{.underline}

Russia's economy is roughly the size of Italy. But thanks to a
tremendous amount of natural resources (particularly oil and natural
gas) that it can sell, along with a military inheritance from the Soviet
Union -- including a large nuclear arsenal -- Russia clearly poses a
real threat to Europe that can't be wished away.

But as President Trump has pointed out, [if Europe really wanted to
defend itself -- and all NATO nations spent 2 percent their gross
domestic products on defense]{.underline}, as they are supposed to be
doing in the next few years -- [Russia would be no match for the might
of just Britain, France and Germany alone.]{.underline}

[Add in the capabilities of all the other members of the alliance --
with America playing a small role as well -- and Putin
would]{.underline}, at least in theory, [have every incentive to play
nice for as long as he stays in power.]{.underline}

Instead, [we have a situation where many of Europe's major powers have
armed forces that can barely do anything anymore. Having focused on
developing expensive social welfare programs]{.underline} that cost
billions of dollars every year, [Europe has instead outsourced its
defense to the U.S. military and U.S. taxpayers.]{.underline}

[This forces America to put vital resources into Europe that are sorely
needed elsewhere -- **especially in Asia**.]{.underline} [**Even having
a military with a \$700 billion annual budget** that is the best in the
world **does not mean America can defend all our allies all over the
world**.]{.underline} [They have a responsibility to pay their fair
share for their own defense and fill the ranks of their own armed
forces,]{.underline} as President Trump has repeatedly pointed out.

[America's power and might must be focused on the greatest of all
threats]{.underline}, with our partners and friends taking on the burden
in other areas of the world that are closer to their doorstep.

[With Chinese economic and military power on the rise, the U**.S. must
concentrate its efforts on the rising Asian superpower** that **seeks to
overthrow the international order** in the Asia-Pacific and turn large
sections of the sea into **its own sovereign territory**. China is the
national security challenge of our time. Russia does not even come
close.]{.underline}

[And then there is North Korea.]{.underline} As the world witnessed last
weekend, [Pyongyang will not be handing over its nuclear bombs anytime
soon. Washington must focus as much of its diplomatic attention --
and]{.underline} if need be, [military might -- on ensuring that we find
a long-term solution to deal with North Korea.]{.underline} [If we fail
to do this, we are doomed to increased tensions]{.underline} like those
that nearly brought East Asia to the brink of nuclear war last summer.

All this means that [America's available diplomatic and military
bandwidth that it can devote to Europe must change. We must face up to
the fact that **NATO**, in its present form, **is
obsolete.**]{.underline} [The alliance must evolve into an organization
led and mostly resourced by Europeans.]{.underline}

So, is America going to quit NATO and go back across the Atlantic or
abandon its allies in Europe? Never. Does that mean a wave of
isolationism has infected Washington and we won't honor our treaty
commitments or push back against Moscow in another crisis? Not at all.

But it does [mean a fundamental shift in burden that a Europe blessed
with wealth and riches can easily maintain. However, if Europe is
unwilling or unable to field a credible armed force to take on
challenges from Russia]{.underline} or elsewhere, [we must question the
utility of an alliance that is a shell of what it used to
be.]{.underline}

During World War I, the U.S. Army produced an iconic recruiting
poster showing Uncle Sam pointing a finger at the viewer saying: "I WANT
YOU FOR U.S. ARMY." We could use a similar poster today for our NATO
allies, saying: "I WANT YOU FOR YOUR OWN ARMIES."

This is the message I expect President Trump will deliver in Europe. And
it's one our partners on the continent need to listen to.

Ukraine a NATO member so it can get direct military support]{.underline}
from the cross-Atlantic alliance [and acquire nuclear
weapons,]{.underline} [which would]{.underline} effectively [reverse the
1994 Budapest Memorandum that facilitated the accession of]{.underline}
Ukraine to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [as a
non-nuclear state.]{.underline}

The situation in the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine is grave, with
the Ukrainian leadership refusing to implement the Minsk Agreement,
which Ukraine, Russia and the Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe signed in 2015 to end the ethnic conflict there in the region.

[[No Russian leader would have accepted the continuous eastward
expansion of NATO]{.mark}. **Imagine what the US would do if Mexico were
inclined to join a military alliance** led by a rival power and talk of
acquiring nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

[Former US president John Kennedy was prepared to invade Cuba if he
could not get the missiles out of that country through negotiations
during the Cuban Missile Crisis.]{.underline} For 13 days in October
1962, the world waited, seemingly on the brink of a nuclear war, hoping
for a peaceful resolution. Thankfully, better sense prevailed over the
US and Soviet leaders.

[But]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin didn't get a similar
response from his US counterpart Joe Biden. [Putin held negotiations
with Western leaders]{.mark}, particularly Biden, [to elicit a promise
that NATO would not accept Ukraine]{.mark} as a member. [But Biden
ignored Russia's concerns]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As such, the [**US and
its allies don't have good reason** to condemn
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

However, [[the military conflict in Ukraine must be immediately
terminated, lest it expands and sucks in the European member states of
NATO]{.mark} and the US. Toward that end, Biden must publicly announce
that NATO will not expand eastward, and Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova
will not be made NATO members.]{.underline}

[Biden must also call an international peace conference which will
establish the permanent neutrality of Ukraine]{.underline} guaranteed by
the United Nations Security Council under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.

[Following that, negotiations can take place between the US and Russia
over the de-nuclearization of Europe]{.underline} [including the removal
of US tactical nuclear weapons from NATO states]{.underline} which
violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [and restoration of the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty that was recklessly terminated
by the Donald Trump administration.]{.underline}

[[The origins of World War I and the World War II **hang like twin
swords of Damocles** over the heads of humankind]{.mark}.]{.underline}
So, [[concerted efforts should be made by]{.mark} all parties, [the
US]{.mark} in particular, [to prevent another]{.mark} \[hu\]man-made
[disaster]{.mark}.]{.underline}

CRISIS"

[[**NATO expansion is the root cause** which triggered Russia's attack
on Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The Eastern European countries which
had formerly been party to the Warsaw Pact]{.underline} and had remained
poor under USSR influence [were tempted with lucrative incentives
offered by NATO. In fact, [**NATO was encircling Russia and squeezing
it** from all possible directions]{.mark}]{.underline}, [having deployed
their]{.underline} defense [forces and weapons around
Russia]{.underline}n territory and [creating]{.underline} a [genuine
concern]{.underline} for the latter.

[[Russia]{.mark} had been trying to convince the US, UK, and EU to
refrain from deploying NATO forces in its neighborhood]{.underline}. [It
[**tried to resolve situation peacefully**]{.mark} and through
diplomatic channels for eight years[, but the West did not
bother]{.mark} with it. The [Second Minsk Agreement]{.mark} was a
document aimed at resolving the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. It
[was agreed to]{.mark}]{.underline} on February 11-12, 2015 at a summit
in Minsk [[by the leaders of]{.mark} Germany, France, [Ukraine and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Normandy Four format, and was signed
by the Contact Group for the Peaceful Settlement of the Situation in
Eastern Ukraine, consisting of representatives of Ukraine, Russia, the
OSCE and the unrecognized Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics.
[Later, the Minsk agreements were approved by]{.underline} a special
resolution of [the UN Security Council. [However]{.mark}, **since the
signing of the Minsk agreements, [not one of their points has been
implemented]{.mark}** [by the Ukrainian side.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Western countries pushed the Ukrainians to avoid implementing these
agreements as they needed another hot spot close to Russia.]{.underline}
[And they **were continuing to train Nazis, indoctrinating an
anti-Russian policy and killing civilians**, including children, women
and the elderly.]{.underline}

[T[he Western media has launched a **massive campaign against
Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**, [distorting facts, spreading fake
news]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [malign narratives and fueling the
situation]{.mark}**. The current irresponsible actions and statements
from the EU, the UK, and the US have **forced** President Putin to put
his nukes on high alert]{.underline}. The ill-motivated policy of arming
civilians for a guerrilla war has also forced Russia to target the civil
population in Ukraine. Initially, Russia was avoiding collateral damage
and was focused only on command and control of security forces, but,
with the distribution of arms to civilians, the targets of Russian
forces grew to include the civilian population too.

War is never appreciated in any part of world. The loss of human lives
is regretted; whether in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine etc.,
all human beings are same and deserve equal respect. In fact, human
beings are the most precious thing in this universe and must be
respected, protected and taken good care of, irrespective of race,
nationality, religion and ethnicity. All humankind is equal and all
mothers bear the same pains.

E[vents during the past few months constituted the last chance to avoid
a hot war in Eastern Europe. [Putin demanded that NATO provide
guarantees]{.mark} on several security issues.]{.underline}
Specifically, [the Kremlin wanted binding assurances [that the alliance
would reduce the scope of its]{.mark}]{.underline} growing [[military
presence in Eastern Europe]{.mark} [and]{.mark} would [never offer
membership to Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} He backed up those demands
with a massive military buildup on Ukraine's borders. [The Biden
administration's response to Russia's quest for meaningful Western
concessions and security guarantees was **tepid and
evasive**.]{.underline} Putin then clearly decided to escalate matters.
[Washington's attempt to make Ukraine a NATO political and military
pawn]{.underline} (even absent the country's formal membership in the
alliance) [may end up costing the Ukrainian people dearly.]{.underline}

History will show that [[Washington's treatment of Russia]{.mark} in the
decades [following the demise of the Soviet Union]{.mark} [was a
**policy blunder of epic proportions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It [was
**entirely predictable that NATO expansion would ultimately lead to**
a]{.mark} tragic, perhaps [violent]{.mark}, [breach of relations with
Moscow]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Perceptive analysts warned of the likely
consequences, but those warnings went unheeded.]{.underline} [The world
is now paying the price for the U.S. foreign policy establishment's
**myopia and arrogance.**]{.underline}

"NATO From Bad to Worse"
https://www.thenation.com/article/world/nato-china-russia-us/ JH-NCP

[[Supporters of NATO]{.mark}'s eastward [expansion]{.mark}
[want]{.mark}ed the [US empire to]{.mark} [encompass a large chunk of
the]{.mark} [former Soviet empire]{.mark} in the belief
that]{.underline}, sooner or later, [post-communist Russia would seek to
revive its long imperial tradition]{.underline}. It [was therefore
necessary to preempt this inevitable development by securing US control
of as much of the former Soviet empire as possible]{.underline}. [Since
Putin's regime has indeed engaged in predatory behavior]{.underline}
since 2008 in what has traditionally been regarded by Russia as its
imperial "near abroad"---[intervention in Georgia in 2008, annexation of
Crimea]{.underline} [and]{.underline} intervention in Donbas in 2014,
[attempted invasion for "regime change" in Ukraine in 2022]{.underline},
and ongoing efforts to occupy the whole of Donbas and adjacent
areas---[one would be tempted to believe that those who advocated NATO's
enlargement have been proven right.]{.underline}

[The truth is, however, that this outcome is **precisely what those who
opposed the enlargement** had cautioned against.]{.underline} [They
rightly predicted that the Russians would see NATO's eastward expansion
as a hostile gesture and that it would therefore breed revanchist
attitudes]{.underline} among them. In other words, [they warned that
[**enlarging NATO in preemption of Russia's return to imperial behavior
would actually act as a self-fulfilling prophecy**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The 1997 summit officially invited Hungary, Poland, and the Czech
Republic to join the alliance. The three Eastern European countries'
accession was completed two years later at the Washington summit that
celebrated NATO's 50th anniversary. It happened at a time when the
alliance was bombing Yugoslavia in contravention of international law,
in the first post-1990 US-led war not authorized by the United Nations
Security Council.

Along with the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that circumvented yet
again the UNSC, and [[NATO's]{.mark}]{.underline} subsequent
[[enlargement]{.mark} in 2004]{.underline} to seven more East European
countries, including the three Baltic states, which were formerly part
of the USSR, this sequence of events [[was **decisive in creating the
animosity between Russia** and the West that was a **prelude to the
invasion of Ukraine.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The forthcoming summit in Madrid will be the occasion of a major
qualitative leap in the definition of NATO's ~~raison d'être~~
\[purpose\],]{.underline} no less consequential than the 1997 summit.
This is not an allusion to the [formal invitation of Finland and Sweden
to join the alliance]{.underline}, although this development [is
certainly very significant]{.underline}, [more so perhaps than all
previous rounds of enlargement, because it will considerably lengthen
NATO's direct border with Russia]{.underline} (Finland's border with
Russia is 1,340 kilometers long). On this issue, [the only question mark
is Turkey's position]{.underline}, since any new membership offer must
be unanimously approved by all existing NATO members, a principle that
grants each one of them an actual veto right. [Ankara wants the two
Nordic states to take measures against the Kurdish movement, strongly
represented among refugees in both countries.]{.underline}

But the [most dangerous novelty at the Madrid summit consists of a major
qualitative extension of NATO's purpose]{.underline}. [Originally
founded as a defensive alliance against the Soviet Union]{.underline}
and its subordinate states, [[NATO has]{.mark} [mutated]{.mark} after
1991 [into a "security organization]{.mark}"---meaning that it has been
involved in military actions]{.underline} (NATO as such did not formally
engage in any war in the USSR's days)---[and redefined its purpose in
ostracizing post-Soviet Russia by expanding toward its
borders.]{.underline} The NATO-Russia Council created in 1997 was a
meager consolation given to Moscow in lieu of inviting it to join the
alliance. Nobody was fooled. [From tacit, [NATO's hostility to Russia
became explicit after]{.mark} the annexation of [Crimea in
2014]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} forthcoming [Madrid summit is going to directly
involve NATO in open hostility to China, far beyond the alliance's
original area of relevance]{.underline}. This area is defined in the
1949 treaty constitutive of NATO as comprising "the territory of any of
the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of
France, on the territory of or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of
any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of
Cancer." [NATO's post-1991 mutation led it to intervene beyond its
members' territory---first in the Balkans, then]{.underline} much
further from its original area, [in Afghanistan]{.underline}, in the
wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks.

P[articipation in the organization's meetings has nevertheless remained
restricted to Europe and North America. No longer. Japan, along with
Australia, New Zealand and South Korea have been invited to attend the
Madrid summit]{.underline} as NATO "partners" in the Asia-Pacific
region---[a very serious provocation to Beijing.]{.underline} [It can
only **interpret this invitation as a step toward the consolidation of
US-led alliances** in a single global network opposed to both Russia and
China.]{.underline} After the preliminary meeting of NATO's defense
ministers held on June 16, the organization's secretary general, Jens
Stoltenberg, declared that the new NATO Strategic Concept that will be
adopted at the Madrid summit will set out the alliance's position "on
Russia, on emerging challenges, and for the first time, on China."

[From the perspective of Washington's drive to perpetuate its hegemony
over most of Europe and the Asia Pacific by portraying Russia and China
as enemies]{.underline}---a grand strategy that has been followed by all
successive post-1991 US administrations---[the new escalation to be
confirmed in Madrid makes full sense.]{.underline} While resolutely
supporting Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion, President
[Biden has multiplied provocative gestures toward Beijing, including his
statement]{.underline}, prior to a summit meeting in May of the
anti-China alliance known as the Quad (Japan, Australia, and India along
with the United States), [that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would defend Taiwan militarily]{.underline}. The
statement was quickly watered down by the State Department, which had in
May removed from a Taiwan Fact Sheet on its website the statement "we do
not support Taiwan independence" and reinstated it in June.

[From the perspective of Europe and the Asia Pacific, acquiescing to
this de facto extension of NATO's role is equivalent to being herded
like Panurge's sheep toward throwing themselves into the
sea.]{.underline} Antagonizing China is not in Europe's interest, nor is
it in the interest of any of the states invited to the Madrid summit.
[Even if the European governments believed that Russia has now
irreversibly become a threat to their security, it would be utterly
counterproductive for them to push Beijing toward consolidating an
alliance with Moscow.]{.underline}

[These [developments bring the world closer to a
**conflagration**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that could **dwarf the ongoing
war in Ukraine**]{.mark} [and **endanger the future of
humankind**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [It is urgent to rebuild a global
peace movement opposed to all military alliances, demanding their
dissolution, a movement opposed as well to]{.underline} the ongoing
massive [increases in military budgets. It is high time to return to
global disarmament under the aegis of the UN]{.underline}, as foreseen
in the UN Charter. This charter is the cornerstone of international law
whose role must be renewed against the ongoing drift toward the law of
the jungle. [The]{.underline} huge and ev[er-growing amounts that are
spent on armament and destruction would be wisely reallocated to the
only wars that are truly in humanity's interest: the wars against
poverty and climate change.]{.underline}

3\. [[NATO expansion was a mistake]{.mark}. Really.]{.underline}

If Trump is mostly confused about [NATO, its most ardent defenders
remain committed to a set of truisms and dogmas that were questionable
when first advanced and have become less and less defensible with time.
Chief [among]{.mark} these [myths]{.mark} is [the idea that NATO
expansion would create]{.mark} a vast [zone of peace in Europe]{.mark}
and give the alliance a new and lofty purpose in the wake of the Cold
War.]{.underline}

[It hasn't quite worked out that way.]{.underline} For starters, [[NATO
expansion poisoned relations with Russia]{.mark} [and played a central
role in creating conflicts]{.mark} between Russia and Georgia and Russia
and Ukraine.]{.underline} It's not the only reason, of course, and I'm
not saying Moscow's responses were legal, proper, justified, or based on
an accurate perception of NATO's intent. I'm only suggesting that
[**Russia's response was not surprising**, especially in light of
Russia's own history]{.underline} [and the George H.W. Bush
administration's earlier pledges not to move NATO "one inch eastward"
following German reunification. The [architects of expansion may
have]{.mark} genuinely [believed that moving NATO eastward posed]{.mark}
[no]{.mark} [threat to Russia]{.mark}; [unfortunately]{.mark},
[Russia]{.mark}'s leaders [never got the memo]{.mark} (and wouldn't have
believed it if they had).]{.underline}

[Furthermore, [expanding NATO increased the number of places the
alliance was]{.mark} formally [obligated to defend]{.mark} (most notably
the Baltic states) but [without]{.mark} significantly
[increasing]{.mark} the [resources]{.mark} available to perform that
task.]{.underline} Once again, [proponents of expansion assumed these
commitments would never have to be honored, only to wake up and discover
they had written a blank check that might be difficult to
cover.]{.underline} And we now know that [[expansion]{.mark} [brought
in]{.mark} some new [members]{.mark} [whose commitment to]{.mark}
liberal [democracy]{.mark} [has proved to be]{.mark} fairly
[shallow]{.mark}.]{.underline} This situation may not be a fatal flaw,
insofar as NATO has tolerated nondemocratic members (e.g., Turkey) in
the past, but [it undermines the proponents' claim that NATO is a
security community based on shared democratic values and an essential
element of a liberal world order.]{.underline}

#### Pro-democracy NATO movements tilted Russia -- it set the floor for the war

**Mearsheimer 14**, John J. Mearsheimer is a political scientist and IR
specialist who started the offensive realist school of thought. ("Why
the Ukraine Crisis is the West's Fault," Hein Online. August 18^th^,

CTF

According to the prevailing wisdom in the West, the Ukraine crisis can
be blamed almost entirely on Russian aggression. Russian President
Vladimir Putin, the argument goes, annexed Crimea out of a long-standing
desire to resuscitate the Soviet empire, and he may eventually go after
the rest of Ukraine, as well as other countries in eastern Europe. In
this view, the ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in
February 2014 merely provided a pretext for Putin's decision to order
Russian forces to seize part of Ukraine.

But this account is wrong: [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and]{.mark} its European [allies]{.mark} [share]{.mark} most of the
[responsibility for the crisis]{.mark}. [The taproot of the trouble is
NATO enlargement]{.mark}, the central element of a larger strategy to
move Ukraine out of Russia's orbit and integrate it into the West. At
the same time, the EU's expansion eastward and [the West's backing of
the pro-democracy movement in Ukraine]{.mark} \-- beginning with the
Orange Revolution in 2004 \-- [were critical elements,
too]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the mid-1990s, [[Russian **leaders have
adamantly opposed NATO enlargement**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and in recent
years, [they have made it clear that they would not stand by while their
strategically important neighbor turned into a Western bastion. [For
Putin, **the illegal overthrow of Ukraine's democratically
elected**]{.mark} and [pro-Russian president]{.mark} \-- which he
rightly labeled a "coup" - - [was the final straw]{.mark}. He responded
by taking Crimea]{.underline}, a peninsula he feared would host a NATO
naval base, [and working to destabilize Ukraine until it abandoned its
efforts to join the West.]{.underline}

Putin's pushback should have come as no surprise. After all, [the West
had been moving into Russia's backyard and threatening its core
strategic interests]{.underline}, a point Putin made emphatically and
repeatedly. [[Elites in the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and
Europe [have been blindsided by events only because they subscribe to a
flawed view of international politics.]{.mark} They tend to believe that
the logic of realism holds little relevance in the twentyfirst century
and that Europe can be kept whole and free on the basis of such liberal
principles as the rule of law, economic interdependence, and
democracy.]{.underline}

But this grand scheme went awry in Ukraine. The [crisis there shows that
realpolitik remains relevant \-- and states that ignore it do so at
their own peril. U.S. and European leaders blundered in attempting to
turn Ukraine into a Western stronghold on Russia's border]{.underline}.
Now that the consequences have been laid bare, it would be an even
greater mistake to continue this misbegotten policy.

Something very dangerous happened a few weeks ago when the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) held its meeting in
Brussels. In its communique after the meeting on June 14, it [identified
China as a "systemic challenge" to areas "relevant to Alliance
security". The implicit message was clear: NATO would like to expand its
tentacles beyond the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.]{.underline} All of
us who live close to the Pacific Ocean, especially in East Asia, should
be deeply concerned. [If NATO comes to the Pacific, it only means
trouble]{.underline} for us. Why? Three reasons. First, [NATO is not a
geopolitically wise organization]{.underline}. It did a brilliant job in
the Cold War, deterring Soviet expansion into Europe. During the Cold
War, it was careful and restrained, building up military capabilities
and avoiding direct military conflicts. [[The Cold War ended 30 years
ago.]{.mark} In theory, after "mission accomplished", [NATO should have
shut down.]{.mark} [In practice, it desperately looked for new
missions]{.mark}. In the process**, it [destabilized
Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It bears remembering that [relations
between Russia and NATO used to be much better, so much so that in 1994,
Russia officially signed up to the Partnership for Peace, a program
aimed at building trust between NATO and other European and former
Soviet countries]{.underline}. But [things fell apart because NATO
rejected Russia's repeated requests to refuse to accept new members in
its "backyard]{.underline}". Then, in April 2008, [NATO pushed things
further, opening the door to membership for Georgia and Ukraine at the
Bucharest summit.]{.underline} As US commentator Tom Friedman noted:
"There is one thing future historians will surely remark upon, and that
is the utter poverty of imagination that characterized US foreign policy
in the late 1990s. They will note that one of the seminal events of this
century took place between 1989 and 1992---the collapse of the Soviet
Empire Thanks to Western resolve and the courage of Russian democrats,
that Soviet empire collapsed without a shot, spawning a democratic
Russia, setting free the former Soviet republics and leading to
unprecedented arms control agreements with the US. And what was
America's response? It was to expand the NATO Cold-War alliance against
Russia and bring it closer to Russia's borders." The result was
inevitable. [[Russia]{.mark} had [tried]{.mark} [to be a friend
of]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} countries [after the Cold War]{.mark}
ended. [Instead, it was slapped in the face with NATO
expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many Western media reports portray
Russia as a "belligerent, aggressive actor". They fail to mention that
NATO actions generated this response. [A truly dangerous moment surfaced
in 2014 when it looked as if NATO was about to encroach into Ukraine
with the ouster of its pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych by
Western-supported demonstrators. For President Vladimir Putin, that was
the last straw, and soon after came the seizure of Crimea, which the
Russians consider part of their cultural heartland. The dangers of
Western expansion into Ukraine were well known]{.underline}. Dr Henry
Kissinger had pointed out that the Ukrainians "live in a country with a
complex history and a polyglot composition. The Western part was
incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939 when Stalin and Hitler
divided up the spoils. Crimea, 60% of whose population is Russian,
became part of Ukraine only in 1954, when Nikita Khrushchev, a Ukrainian
by birth, awarded it as part of the 300th-year celebration of a Russian
agreement with the Cossacks. The west is largely Catholic; the east is
largely Russian Orthodox. The west speaks Ukrainian; the east speaks
mostly Russian. Any attempt by one wing of Ukraine to dominate the
other---as has been the pattern---would lead eventually to civil war or
break-up. To treat Ukraine as part of an East--West confrontation would
scuttle for decades any prospect to bring Russia and
theWest---especially Russia and Europe---into a cooperative
international system". Sadly, since 2014, Ukraine has become a divided
country. [If [NATO had shown greater]{.mark} geopolitical [restraint,
these problems could have been avoided]{.mark}]{.underline}. The second
major weakness of post-Cold War NATO is that [its behavior reflects the
old adage: [If you are a hammer, every problem looks like a
nail.]{.mark} Curiously, during the Cold War, NATO dropped very few
bombs on foreign countries. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has
dropped a massive amount of bombs on many countries.]{.underline}
Between March and June 1999, NATO bombing campaigns were estimated to
have killed 500 civilians in the former Yugoslavia. [NATO also dropped
several thousand cluster bombs there, despite their use being illegal
under the 2010 Convention on Cluster Munitions Treaty]{.underline}.
[NATO airstrikes in Libya in 2011 resulted in 7700 bombs dropped, and
killed an estimated 70 civilians]{.underline}. Many of the [bombing
missions were illegal under international law.]{.underline} I vividly
remember having dinner at the home of a former Canadian diplomat in
Ottawa when NATO decided to bomb Yugoslav forces in 1999. This Canadian
diplomat was deeply worried. Since this military campaign was neither an
act of self-defense nor authorized by the United Nations Security
Council, it was clearly and technically illegal under international
lawIndeed, Ms Carla Del Ponte, a former special prosecutor in the
International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, tried to investigate
whether NATO committed war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. Even though
most NATO countries believe in the sanctity of international law, they
applied so much political pressure that Ms Del Ponte could not carry out
her investigations. Even worse, [NATO has often started a military
campaign and then walked away from the disastrous consequences of its
intervention. Libya is a classic example of this. The NATO countries
were exultant when Muammar Gaddafi was removed from Libya. However,
after the country split apart and became caught up in a civil war,
**NATO just walked away**]{.underline}. Many years ago, a wise former US
secretary of state, Mr Colin Powell, warned against such military
interventions by citing a common statement in crystal shops: "If you
break it, you own it." NATO failed to own the wreckage it left behind.
This leads to the third danger: [East Asia has developed, with the
assistance of ASEAN, a very cautious and pragmatic geopolitical
culture]{.underline}. In the 30 years since the end of the Cold War,
NATO has dropped several thousand bombs on many countries. By contrast,
in the same period, no bombs have been dropped anywhere in East Asia.
This is therefore the biggest danger we face in NATO expanding its
tentacles from the Atlantic to the Pacific: [It could end up exporting
its disastrous militaristic culture to the relatively peaceful
environment]{.underline} we have [developed in East Asia. Indeed, [if
NATO was]{.mark} a [wise]{.mark}, thinking, and learning organization[,
it should]{.mark} actually [be studying the East Asian
record]{.mark}---especially the ASEAN record [of preserving peace---and
learning lessons from it.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Instead, it is
doing the opposite, thereby creating real dangers for our region. In
view of the risks to East Asia through the potential expansion of NATO
culture, all of East Asia should speak with one voice and say no to
NATO.

[Over the past 22 years]{.underline} in particular, [several of

Russian President Vladimir Putin's illegal and horrific war in
Ukraine. But a [brief review of U.S.-Russian relations underscores the
power of unintended consequences.]{.underline}

Putin became acting Russian president on New Year's Day 2000, the same
year George W. Bush would be elected America's 43rd president. The Boris
Yeltsin presidency left Russia in dire straits, psychologically damaged
by the demise of its once superpower status. In his Millennium Address
that day, Putin provided the outlines of how he would restore Russian
greatness.

Initially, Bush and Putin got along. But the new administration's
obsession with Iran as the enemy led Bush to focus the Pentagon on
missile defense and space. One consequence was that Bush announced
America's intent to withdraw from the 1974 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
that had been central to the U.S.-USSR strategic
relationship. Abrogating the treaty did not go down well in Moscow,
especially given the the huge military technological lead the Kremlin
believed Washington had after the 1991 Gulf War. That was before 9-11.

[When America intervened [in Afghanistan]{.mark} in late 2001, Putin was
irritated because the [Bush]{.mark} team [rejected Russian
advice]{.mark} based on its decade-long failure in that
country.]{.underline} [In 2003, Putin strongly counseled Bush against
invading Iraq, as the Russian leader feared the region would be thrown
into turmoil.]{.underline} [And the [continuing expansion of NATO was
neuralgic for Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} [A series of U.S.
administrations downplayed or ignored]{.underline} how serious [this
issue]{.underline} was for Russia.

[A[t the Munich Security Conference]{.underline}]{.mark}[, Putin
unleashed an angry broadside against the U.S. as a "uni-power" and
against NATO expansion. ]{.underline}Participants were shocked by the
intensity of Putin's attacks but otherwise largely dismissed them. That
was a mistake. [It was clear that [Putin believed he was being]{.mark}
disrespected and [marginalized by]{.mark} the U.S. and [NATO]{.mark},
adding to his growing resentment about the patronizing treatment he
believed Russia was receiving.]{.underline}

[The [2008]{.mark} [NATO Summit]{.mark} ]{.underline}at Bucharest was
perhaps the turning point. [Georgia and Ukraine had applied for
NATO]{.underline} MAP --- [Membership Action Plan, the roadmap to full
membership.]{.underline} Blocked by France and Germany, MAP was
denied. But [in a throwaway line, President Bush [stated that Georgia
and Ukraine could at some date join.]{.mark} That "promise" was included
in the final summit report so as not to offend the American
president.]{.underline}

[[Putin was outraged]{.mark} and told Bush "this will not stand,"
echoing George H. W. Bush's response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. Bush dismissed the warning. ]{.underline}

[In 2008, Putin provoked Georgia to respond to a Russian "false flag"
operation]{.underline} [and]{.underline} subsequently [occupied South
Ossetia and Abkhazia.]{.underline} [With contested borders, Georgia was
technically ineligible for NATO membership. Six years later, Russia
annexed Crimea from Ukraine]{.underline} [following]{.underline} the
Maidan Square protests and [the unseating of pro-Russia President Viktor
Yanukovych, accusing Washington of abetting regime change.]{.underline}

[In 2016, Russia was charged with interfering in U.S. presidential
elections]{.underline} and widespread hacking
operations. [[Despite]{.mark} President [Trump's]{.mark} [attempt to
improve relations with Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}, at best [[they
remained frozen]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some Democrats accused Trump of
being Putin's "useful idiot." And [relations were made more toxic by a
series of U.S. defense strategies]{.underline}, beginning with the Obama
administration [targeting Russia as one of five potential adversaries to
be "deterred and, if war came, defeated."]{.underline}

[Perhaps the incompetent U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021
convinced Putin he could take bold action in Ukraine without much
risk. After massing troops on Ukraine's borders, Russia subsequently
sent demands to the U.S., NATO and EU calling for a new European
security framework; NATO retraction to the West; and  denying Ukraine
NATO  membership. Each was rejected.]{.underline}

[Instead, the U.S. proposed talks on strategic stability and arms
control, ignoring Putin's key demands.]{.underline} [[When Putin decided
to invade Ukraine is unclear]{.mark}. But [from his perspective, he was
left with no choice.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Ukraine was a vital Russian
interest]{.underline} to be resolved by war if necessary. The West
failed to comprehend that.

Could any U.S. actions have prevented war? Probably not. But failure to
consider unintended consequences is a lesson that should not be
forgotten. Perhaps that is what the pope meant.

#### NATO expansionism since the end of the Soviet Union led up to the war in Ukraine

**Carpenter 2/24/22.** Ted Galen, Senior fellow in security studies at
the Cato Institute, is the author of 12 books and more than 900 articles
on international affairs. "Ignored Warnings: How NATO Expansion Led To
The Current Ukraine Tragedy"
https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/02/ignored-warnings-how-nato-expansion-led-to-the-current-ukraine-tragedy/
JH-NCP

George Kennan, the intellectual father of America's containment policy
during the Cold War, perceptively [warned]{.underline} in a May 2,
1998  New York Times interview about [what]{.underline} the Senate's
ratification of [NATO's first round of expansion would set in motion. "I
think it is the beginning of a new cold war,"]{.underline} Kennan
stated. "[I think the Russians will gradually react quite adversely and
it will affect their policies. I think it is a tragic mistake. There was
no reason for this whatsoever.  No one was threatening anybody
else."]{.underline}

He was right, but U.S. and [NATO leaders proceeded with new rounds of
expansion, including the provocative step of adding the three Baltic
republics.]{.underline} [Those countries not only had been part of the
Soviet Union, but]{.underline} they had [also]{.underline} [been part of
Russia's empire during the Czarist era. That wave of expansion now had
NATO perched on the border of]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n
Federation.

[Moscow's patience with NATO's ever more intrusive behavior was wearing
thin.]{.underline} [The last reasonably friendly warning from Russia
that the alliance needed to back off came in March 2007]{.underline},
[when Putin addressed the annual Munich Security Conference. "NATO has
put its frontline forces on our borders]{.underline}," Putin complained.
[NATO expansion "represents a serious provocation that reduces the level
of mutual trust.]{.underline} And we have the right to ask: against whom
is this expansion intended?  And what happened to the assurances our
western partners made after the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact?"

In his memoir, Duty, [Robert M. Gates, who served as secretary of
defense in the administrations of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama,
stated his belief that "the relationship with Russia had been badly
mismanaged after]{.underline} [\[George H.W.\] Bush left office in
1993]{.underline}."Among other missteps, "U.S. agreements with the
Romanian and Bulgarian governments to rotate troops through bases in
those countries was a needless provocation." In an implicit rebuke to
the younger Bush, [Gates asserted that "trying to bring Georgia and
Ukraine into NATO was truly overreaching." That move, he contended, was
a case of "recklessly ignoring what the Russians considered their own
vital national interests]{.underline}."

The following year, the Kremlin demonstrated that its discontent with
NATO's continuing incursions into Russia's security zone had moved
beyond verbal objections. Moscow exploited a foolish provocation by
Georgia's pro-Western government to launch a military offensive that
brought Russian troops to the outskirts of the capital. Thereafter,
Russia permanently detached two secessionist-minded Georgian regions and
put them under effective Russian control.

[Western (especially U.S.) leaders continued to blow through red warning
light after a red warning light, however.]{.underline} [The Obama
administration's shockingly arrogant meddling in Ukraine's internal
political affairs in 2013 and 2014 to help demonstrators overthrow
Ukraine's elected, pro‐​Russia president was the single most brazen
provocation, and it caused tensions to spike.]{.underline} [Moscow
immediately responded by seizing and annexing Crimea, and a new cold war
was underway]{.underline} with a vengeance.

Could the Ukraine Crisis Have Been Avoided? 

[Events during the past few months constituted the last chance to avoid
a hot war in Eastern Europe. Putin demanded that NATO
provide guarantees]{.underline} [on several security
issues.]{.underline} [Specifically, the Kremlin wanted binding
assurances that the alliance would reduce the scope of its growing
military presence in Eastern Europe and would never offer membership to
Ukraine]{.underline}. He backed up those demands with a massive military
buildup on Ukraine's borders. The [Biden]{.underline} administration's
[response to Russia's quest for meaningful Western concessions and
security guarantees was tepid and evasive.  Putin then clearly decided
to escalate matters. Washington's attempt to make Ukraine a NATO
political and military pawn]{.underline} (even absent the country's
formal membership in the alliance) [may end up costing the Ukrainian
people dearly.]{.underline}

The Ukraine Tragedy

History will show that [Washington's treatment of Russia in the decades
following the demise of the Soviet Union was a policy blunder of epic
proportions.  It was entirely predictable that NATO expansion would
ultimately lead to a]{.underline} tragic, perhaps [violent, breach of
relations with Moscow]{.underline}. [Perceptive analysts warned of the
likely consequences, but those warnings went unheeded.  We are now
paying the price for the U.S. foreign policy establishment's myopia and
arrogance.]{.underline}

#### NATO cooperation worsens deterrence and provokes Russia war 

**Carpenter 2022** (Ted Galen Carpenter is senior fellow for defense and
foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. Carpenter served as Cato's
director of foreign policy studies from 1986 to 1995 and as vice
president for defense and foreign policy studies from 1995 to 2011,
"NATO Security Dependents Are Not Useful Allies",
<https://www.cato.org/commentary/nato-security-dependents-are-not-useful-allies>
)//MargaretE

SINCE THE end of World War II, U.S. officials have had an unduly
expansive concept of what constitutes worthwhile strategic allies for
the United States. In too many cases, [the "allies" that Washington
touts are small, weak, often militarily useless dependents.]{.underline}
Worse, [some of them are on bad terms with more powerful neighboring
states.]{.underline} Under those circumstances, [the so‐​called allies
are major liabilities rather than assets]{.underline} to the United
States. Indeed, they are potential snares, [ones that can entangle
America in unnecessary military confrontations.]{.underline}

Washington would do well to become far more selective about which
nations it includes in its roster of allies, and U.S. leaders should
stop elevating security dependents to the status of allies. When U.S.
officials described the regimes that Washington installed through
military force in Afghanistan and Iraq as allies, it became clear that
they had lost even minimal understanding of the concept. That point
became abundantly evident when their Afghan client collapsed almost
overnight in the face of the Taliban military offensive. [It's time for
U.S. policymakers to do better.]{.underline}

TROUBLING PROMISCUITY about acquiring weak U.S. security partners was
evident even during the Cold War, and the tendency has become even more
pronounced in the post‐​Cold War era. As the fiasco in Afghanistan (and
its ugly predecessor in South Vietnam) confirmed, that problem with U.S.
foreign policy has existed in multiple regions. [However, the defect has
become most acute with respect to Washington's campaign to expand NATO
into Eastern Europe]{.underline}. Since the mid‐​1990s, [U.S.
administrations have worked to add a menagerie of new NATO members, and
it has done so with even less selectivity and good judgment than some
people use to acquire Facebook friends.]{.underline}

[Many of those new members have very little to offer to the United
States as security partners.]{.underline} Indeed[, some are mini‐​states,
bordering on being micro‐​states.]{.underline} Such lightly armed
Lilliputians [would add little or nothing to Washington's own
capabilities---especially in a showdown with another major
power.]{.underline}

[As economic assets, their importance is decidedly limited, and
militarily, they are even less valuable. It's hard to see how new NATO
allies such as Albania, Slovenia, Montenegro, and North Macedonia
enhance America's power and security.]{.underline} That point should be
apparent based on size of population alone. Albania's 2.87 million,
North Macedonia's 2.1 million, and Slovenia's 2.07 million people put
those countries squarely in the mini‐​state category, while Montenegro's
628,000 barely deserves even that label. It doesn't get much better with
respect to either annual gross domestic product or size of military
forces. Even Slovenia's \$52.8 billion GDP puts that country only
eighty‐​sixth in the global rankings. Albania's \$15.2 billion (125th),
North Macedonia's \$12.26 billion (135th) and Montenegro's \$4.78
billion (159th) are even less impressive.

The military forces that our new NATO allies can field are not likely to
strike fear into Russia or any other would‐​be aggressor. Albania's armed
forces consist of 8,500 active‐​duty personnel, Slovenia's consist of
8,500, and North Macedonia has 9,000 available. Montenegro's active‐​duty
force totals 2,400. In comparison, the Austin, Texas, police department
has 2,422 people in its ranks.

Granted, the Cold War edition of NATO also had some mini‐​states as
members, most notably Luxembourg and Iceland. However, those members
were located within a stable, democratic Western Europe. Their defense
also was geographically inseparable from Washington's mission of
protecting important military and economic players, such as West
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Great Britain, from what appeared to
be a totalitarian superpower with expansionist ambitions. That situation
was qualitatively different from Washington's gratuitous post‐​Cold War
decision to manage the security of quarrelsome mini‐​states in the
chronically volatile Balkans. Since the mid‐​1990s, the United States has
entangled itself in the region's parochial spats, but [giving some of
the countries NATO membership intensified America's exposure to needless
risks and burdens.]{.underline}

[THE RISK-BENEFIT calculation is even worse with respect to some of the
other small nations that have joined]{.underline} NATO in the post‐​Cold
War era. [Those partners are not merely irrelevant from the standpoint
of U.S. security; **they are potentially dangerous tripwires that could
trigger a conflict between the United States and a nuclear‐​armed
Russia.**]{.underline}

That point underscores one very important difference between individuals
casually amassing Facebook friends and the United States promiscuously
adding new security mendicants. Facebook friends do not have the ability
to entangle anyone in armed conflicts; irresponsible security dependents
definitely can do so. Indeed, there are multiple examples throughout
history of such clients snaring their patrons into devastating,
unnecessary wars. One notable example was how Tsarist Russia's fateful
decision to give strong backing to Serbia in the latter's escalating
quarrel with Austria‐​Hungary following the assassination of Archduke
Franz Ferdinand helped ignite World War I---and caused the utter ruin of
the Russian empire.

The United States is flirting with a similar danger today regarding its
small clients in Eastern Europe. President George W. [Bush's decision to
support the NATO membership bids of the three Baltic republics was---and
remains---highly provocative to Russia.]{.underline} [One crucial way to
reduce the danger of armed clashes between great powers is to show
mutual respect for respective spheres of influence. Washington has
repeatedly violated that principle by pushing NATO to expand right up to
Russia's border.]{.underline}

#### Putin's main concern is NATO -- existence fuels his militarism and it's a huge risk

**Bender 2015** (Jeremy Bender eceived a BA in Middle Eastern Studies
and religion from Rutgers University. He went on to teach English at
Inonu University in Turkey through the Fulbright Program. He wrote
briefly at BuzzFeed before coming to Business Insider, This is the
simplest explanation of why Putin is so opposed to NATO,
<https://www.businessinsider.com/simplest-explanation-of-why-putin-hates-nato-2015-2>
)//MargaretE

[For Putin, the peeling away of countries from Russia towards NATO comes
as both an existential threat and a personal insult. As a former agent
in the KGB and an avowed nationalist, Putin has dreams of resurrecting
the glories of Imperial Russia]{.underline} --- [a goal that is
seriously hampered by]{.underline} the inclusion of what Putin would
deem rightful Russian lands, such as the Baltics, into [the NATO
alliance.]{.underline}

With this in mind, [it is easy to see why Putin signed off on Russia\'s
new military doctrine in December 2014. The doctrine, which placed
explicit focus on **NATO being Moscow\'s main existential enemy** and
threat, called on the **further militarization** of three geopolitical
frontlines: the Russian Baltic Sea exclave of Kaliningrad near Poland,
the annexed Crimean peninsula, and the Arctic.]{.underline}

Putin almost certainly saw the uprising in Ukraine --- during which the
country\'s pro-Russian leadership was replaced in favor of a more
western-friendly one in the beginning of 2014 --- as the last straw. The
subsequent annexation of Crimea and the backing of separatists in the
east served to delay Ukraine\'s eventual pivot towards the European
Union and NATO.

\"**[Expanding NATO further into post-Soviet space is a red line with
Russia, and the US is frankly not in a position to challenge it without
running a huge risk,\"]{.underline}** Greg Scoblete of RealClearWorld
told Forbes. \"Put bluntly, Russia will be able to invade eastern
Ukraine faster than the West could admit Ukraine into NATO to deter
Russian aggression.\"

Indeed, Ukraine called for full integration into NATO in August 2014
once Russian armaments began to freely enter into the country. But NATO
has steep membership requirements and there\'s no current timetable for
admitting Ukraine into the alliance.

Today, [Putin continues to consider the change in leadership Ukraine to
be illegitimate and yet another tool of NATO expansion aimed at hemming
in Russia.]{.underline}

[\"This is not the army, per se, this is a foreign proxy, in this case a
foreign NATO legion, which, of course, doesn\'t pursue the objective of
national interests of Ukraine,\" Putin said at the end of January.
\"They have entirely different goals, and they are tied with the
achievement of the geopolitical goals of containing
Russia.\"]{.underline}

#### Russia-NATO nuclear war causes extinction -- scientific studies 

**Lynas 2022** (Mark Lynas s a British author and journalist whose work
is focused on environmentalism and climate change. He is a contributor
to New Statesman, The Ecologist, Granta and Geographical magazines, and

says: Could humans survive a nuclear war between NATO and Russia?,

)//MargaretE

Russian leader Vladimir [Putin has suggested that he would consider
using nuclear weapons if confronted with a NATO military response in
Ukraine]{.underline}, [or if faced with a direct threat]{.underline} to
his person or regime. [If the war spreads to]{.underline} a
[NATO]{.underline} country like Estonia or Poland a direct US-Russia
[confrontation would take place, with a clear danger of runaway nuclear
escalation.]{.underline} **[The world is therefore arguably now closer
to nuclear conflict than at any time since the 1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis]{.underline}**. So what would a full-scale nuclear exchange look
like in reality? Is it truly global Armageddon, or would it be
survivable for some people and places? Many scientists have investigated
this question already. Their work is surprisingly little known, likely
because in peacetime no one wants to think the unthinkable. But [we are
no longer in peacetime and the shadows of multiple mushroom clouds are
looming once again over our planet.]{.underline} Current nuclear weapons
inventories The latest assessment of Russian nuclear military capability
estimates that [as of early 2022 Russia has a stockpile of approximately
4,477 nuclear warheads]{.underline} --- nearly 6,000 if "retired"
warheads are included. The [US maintains a similar inventory of 5,500
warheads]{.underline}, with 3,800 of those rapidly deployable. The
explosive power of these weapons is difficult to comprehend. It has been
estimated that about 3 million tons (megatons or Mt) of TNT equivalent
were detonated in World War II. For comparison, each of the UK's Trident
submarines carries 4 megatons of TNT equivalent on 40 nuclear warheads,
meaning [each submarine can cause more explosive destruction than took
place during the entirety of World War II.]{.underline} Hiroshima and
Nagasaki [In 1945 the US attacked the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki with atomic bombs, giving us two real-world examples of the
effects of nuclear weapons on human populations.]{.underline} A total of
140,000 people in Hiroshima and 73,000 in Nagasaki died instantaneously
or within five months due to the nuclear blast, intense radiant heat
from the fireball and ionizing radiation. [Many people caught within 1km
of ground zero were carbonized by heat rays, and those up to 1.5km away
suffered flash burning with large areas of skin later peeling
off.]{.underline} Some, especially those inside buildings, were reduced
to white bones as all flesh was vaporized by the intense heat. [Many
survivors,]{.underline} later to become known as hibakusha in Japanese,
suffered acute radiation sickness (ARS) from neutron and gamma rays
released by nuclear fission in the blasts. Symptoms included bloody
diarrhea, hair loss, fever and intense thirst. Many [later
died.]{.underline} As well as direct radiation from the fireballs [they
were also exposed to radioactive fallout]{.underline} from the bomb. The
longer-term effects of radiation experienced by the hibakusha have been
intensively studied, and include increased levels of leukemia and solid
cancers. However, experiencing an atomic bombing was not an automatic
death sentence: among the 100,000 or so survivors the excess rates of
cancer over the subsequent years were about 850, and leukemia less than
100. Hiroshima and Nagasaki show that --- apart from short-term ARS ---
[long-term radiation from fallout will be the least of our problems
following a nuclear war. **Much more serious will be social collapse,
famine and the breakdown of much of the planetary
biosphere.**]{.underline} 'Limited' nuclear conflict -- 100 warheads
between India and Pakistan Prior to the Ukraine war it seemed very
unlikely that the superpowers would confront each other again, so many
researchers turned to studying the impacts of more limited nuclear
conflicts. One study published two years ago looked at the likely
impacts of a nuclear exchange of about 100 Hiroshima-sized detonations
(15 kt yield each) on the most-populated urban areas of India and
Pakistan. Each detonation was estimated to incinerate an area of 13
square km, with this scenario generating about 5 Tg (teragrams) of soot
as smoke from wildfires and burning buildings entered the atmosphere.
Direct human deaths in this "limited" nuclear war scenario are not
quantified in the study, but would presumably number in the tens to
hundreds of millions. [The planetary impacts are also severe: as the
soot reaches the stratosphere it circulates globally, blocking incoming
solar radiation and dropping the Earth's surface temperature by 1.8C in
the first five years.]{.underline} This would be a greater cooling than
caused by any recent volcanic eruption, and [more than any climate
perturbation for at least the last 1,000 years. Rainfall patterns are
drastically altered, and total precipitation declines by about 8
percent.]{.underline} (These results come from widely-used climate
models of the same types used to project long-term impacts of greenhouse
gas emissions.) [Food exports collapse as stocks are depleted within a
single year, and by year four a total of 1.3 billion people face a loss
of about a fifth of their current food supply]{.underline}. The
researchers conclude that "[a regional conflict using \<1 percent of the
worldwide nuclear arsenal could have adverse consequences for global
food security unmatched in modern history."]{.underline} A 2014 study of
the same scenario (of a 100-weapon nuclear exchange between India and
Pakistan) found that [the soot penetrating the stratosphere would cause
severe damage to the Earth's ozone layer, increasing UV penetration by
30-80 percent]{.underline} over the mid-latitudes. [This would cause
"widespread damage to human health, agriculture, and terrestrial and
aquatic ecosystems,]{.underline}" the researchers wrote. "The combined
cooling and enhanced UV would put significant pressures on global food
supplies and [could trigger a global nuclear famine."]{.underline}
Full-scale nuclear exchange [If global nuclear famine could result from
just 100 nuclear detonations, what might be the result of a fuller
exchange of the several thousand warheads held in current inventories by
the US and Russia?]{.underline} One 2008 study looked at a Russia-US
nuclear war scenario, where Russia would target 2,200 weapons on Western
countries and the US would target 1,100 weapons each on China and
Russia. In total, therefore, 4,400 warheads detonate, equivalent to
roughly half the current inventories held each by Russia and the US.
Nuclear weapons held by other states were not used in this scenario,
which has a 440-Mt explosive yield, equivalent to about 150 times all
the bombs detonated in World War II. This [full-scale nuclear war was
estimated to cause 770 million direct deaths and generate 180 Tg of soot
from burning cities and forests.]{.underline} In the US, about half the
population would be within 5km of a ground zero, and a fifth of the
country's citizens would be killed outright. A subsequent study,
published in 2019, looked at a comparable but slightly lower 150 Tg
atmospheric soot injection following an equivalent scale nuclear war.
[The devastation causes so much smoke that only 30-40 percent of
sunlight reaches the Earth's surface for the subsequent six months. A
massive drop in temperature follows, with the weather staying below
freezing throughout the subsequent Northern Hemisphere
summer]{.underline}. In Iowa, for example, the model shows temperatures
staying below 0°C for 730 days straight. [**There is no growing season.
This is a true nuclear winter.** Nor is it just a short
blip]{.underline}. Temperatures still drop below freezing in summer for
several years thereafter, and global precipitation falls by half by
years three and four. It takes over a decade for anything like climatic
normality to return to the planet. [By this time, most of Earth's human
population will be long dead. The world's food production would crash by
more than 90 percent, causing global famine that would kill billions by
starvation.]{.underline} In most countries less than a quarter of the
population survives by the end of year two in this scenario. [Global
fish stocks are decimated and the ozone layer collapses.]{.underline}
The models are eerily specific. In the 4,400 warhead/150 Tg soot nuclear
war scenario, averaged over the subsequent five years, [China sees a
reduction in food calories of 97.2 percent, France by 97.5 percent,
Russia by 99.7 percent, the UK by 99.5 percent and the US by 98.9
percent. In all these countries, virtually everyone who survived the
initial blasts would subsequently starve.]{.underline}

[The PR China had opened wide door to European military technology to
invade into PR China's defense sector since the economic embargo was
lifted to transfer advanced military technology]{.underline}. [Financial
dynamic invested into PR China's defense sector had completely changed
situation over the past five years into military modernization process
of the PR China's army.]{.underline} Chinese President [Xi Jinping has
put an end to the practice of making any progress on international
security cooperation with Europe conditional on the lifting of the
embargo.]{.underline} This is the result of the PR China's arms
industry's progress (Duchatel, 2018). The PR China had access to
critical technologies that had speed up modernization process for ten
years, and beside it had created main conditions for advanced innovation
and leadership for the next generations of arms toward C4I updated
technology. The PR China had paid off for some advanced hi-tech licensed
equipment -- those are being incorporated into Chinese military
helicopters, ships and submarines, and were needed to speed up
modernization process of China army but it seems that the EU thoughts
ongoing into direction to prevent all transfers of dual-use technology
to the PR China as to protect Europe's critical technology. China's
economic intensions became doubtful about financial influence to invest
more money by spending into common hi tech military projects together
with Europe champions into defense sector as the PR China tries to
increase pressure by lifting economic barriers to arms transfers and
export controls. [**The main barrier to deepening of the EU-PR China
defense cooperation is the will of NATO allies and especially of the
US** to preserve sensitive hi-tech military technology, whilst the PR
China is still accused for industrial espionage and steeling military
patents.]{.underline} [Arms control measures among transferring hi --
tech military technology to third states could not be secured by NATO
protocol]{.underline} of regime export mil technology or under the PESCO
projects carried out by the EDA control. [The PR China may use hi-tech
military projects to benefit itself to modernize own army into all
military branches by following up European modernization
process]{.underline} under Horizon 2020 projects. The defense companies
from the EU shall take decision, if cooperate or not cooperate into the
joint EU-PR China defense cooperation. [The PR China had pleased the EU
member states to fully participate into the Eurasian megaproject and
invest more money to rebuild the Silk Road strategy]{.underline} toward
the western part of Heartland. This invitation was referred on the
defense cooperation too if EU states did not decide for protectionism.
[It was likely seen that the EU had been stuck between US and PR China's
economic influence from foreign geoeconomic investments.]{.underline}
The PR China, meanwhile, "is leveraging military modernization,
influence operations, and predatory economics to coerce neighboring
countries to re-order the Indo-Pacific region to their advantage," the
Strategy declares. And [the Chinese military modernization program, it
adds, is designed to achieve "regional hegemony in the near-term and
displacement of the USA to achieve global pre-eminence in the
future"]{.underline} (Morgan, 2018).

The EU and China signed a 'strategic partnership' in 2003, and adopted
2020 strategic agenda for cooperation in 2013. These agreements resulted
from a mutual commitment to cooperation and signal an interest to
further advance ties" (Dorussen, 2017: 2). Prominent role from [EU
states]{.underline} those had invested more money into defense sector
into foreign business had cemented economic benefit in the PR China
defense sector for some EU defense firms, to expand the global market
for selling military goods out of the EU market, that became more
relevant on global market inside the EU-PR China defense relation.
Solidarity and unity were cracked down into one voice while decision
making process inside European NATO pillar had been divided into two
political blocks. Atlantic hub encountered against European hub for more
centrists reproach toward federalization process to form the EU super
state. Political dwindling, dividing and disunity (3D) had brought NATO
alliance to crack solidarity and unity apart between Europe and the USA,
only media black coverage had been disseminating lies into publicity
that was everything fine within the EU-US bilateral cooperation under
the NATO alliance but this was false flags signal to sweep rubbish under
the political carpet. Those [political, economic and defense cooperation
for 3D reasons had worsened fragility under the NATO alliance.
Otherwise, an alternative was opened as China signaled to EU states as
to re-join Silk Road strategy on continent. China is willing to invest
more money into EU critical infrastructure to reconnect roads and rails
guided from Peking to Europe by transiting Russian
territory]{.underline}.

Why is the EU important for PR China's geoeconomic interests? Truly
answer singles out: [**the PR China wants Europe to counterbalance
American power** while Europe is a softer partner than the US. The EU is
weak, politically divided and militarily non-influential]{.underline}
(Hanso, 2017: 125). China plays on the weakest point into the EU
fragility while it knows well how to approach with multilateral
diplomatic step as Beijing treats the relationship like a game of chess
with 27 opponents crowding the other side of the chess board.

#### China leadership is key to solve warming

[Where the US is stepping down, China is stepping up. One reason China
is motivated to take action when the US is not lies in the fact that
China, infamous for its unbreathable air, has already paid dearly for
its dependency on coal. The International Energy Agency in Paris reports
that fossil fuel emissions in China have close to tripled since 2000.
This is mainly a reflection of China's large population as per person
emissions are lower than those in the US. In 2009, 16 of the world's 20
most polluted cities8 were in China. Today only the bottom four cities
on the top 20 list are in China because the government has been
investing in sustainable technology such as electric cars, wind and
solar energy, as well as implementing emission reducing
legislation]{.underline}.

In 2013 and 2014, [the Chinese government encouraged several pilot cap
and trade programs that generated close to \$680 million in the 2017
fiscal year. In December of 2017 China announced a new plan9 for an even
more comprehensive nationwide market focusing on their power generation
sector to trade emissions credits that allow businesses to buy and sell
the credits that allow them to emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. Cap
and trade programs10 are one of the most talked about ways to combat
climate change using the free market]{.underline}. They incentivize
business that use clean energy by limiting the total amount of emissions
allowed to all companies and then allowing those that have not used all
of the emissions they are allotted to sell them to companies that
continue to pollute. Hypothetically, t[his incentivizes companies to go
green by ensuring that eco-friendly policies save them money. The
challenge with a cap and trade program is closing the loopholes so that
heavy polluters cannot skirt around the issue and do, in fact, take
initiative to limit emissions.]{.underline} Though there is room for
some refinement, the existing measures are indicative of China's
awareness and sense of urgency around the issue of climate change.

Ch[ina's shift away from coal is not only environmentally responsible,
it is also economically shrewd as they are setting themselves up for
financial success for decades to come and effectively leaving the United
States to wallow in what remains of their 20th century
glory]{.underline}. The World Health Organization has acknowledged
China's efforts in curbing pollution and hopes that other nations will
take a cue from their actions. In order to stay economically relevant,
nations need to invest in sustainable energy sources. The Visual
Capitalist cites the "the Green Revolution" as one of the 8 major forces
shaping the future11 of the global economy as well as the fact that by
2040, a total of \$10.2 trillion will be invested in new power
generation capacity worldwide. Nations that chose to live in denial of
their impact on climate change are also in denial of the fact that they
are simultaneously becoming relics from a pre-climate change era.

[**It's time for nations around the world to follow China's lead** and
start thinking about negative externalities regardless of the scale of
the project; inaction only exacerbates the issue]{.underline}. Each day
is an opportunity for nations to redefine themselves and prepare for the
future. As there are no binding international climate treaties already
in existence, we don't have the privilege of taking the time to reach a
global agreement on what actions should be taken. Individual nation
states must act rapidly and prudently to lead the charge by investing in
sustainable practices by being practical and responsible inhabitants of
Earth in order to both prevent further environmental damage and stay
economically relevant.

### climate turn 

#### NATO defense spending trades off with warming -- keeping the alliance leads causes them to miss climate marks -- the UN is key 

**Lorincz 19** - Tamara Lorincz is a PhD candidate in the Balsillie
School of International Affairs, Wilfrid Laurier University, and member
of the Canadian Voice of Women for Peace. ("NATO is a threat to the

Earlier this month, the 29 leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) went to London to celebrate their alliance's
anniversary but snubbed the opening of United Nations climate
conference, where the other 164 world leaders and their delegations were
meeting in Madrid.

[Despite several scientific reports urgently warning about the
devastating impacts and security implications of rising carbon
emissions, [climate]{.mark} change was [not]{.mark} even [on the NATO
agenda.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Instead, [the alliance leaders discussed Russia and China as
adversaries, space as a new warfighting domain, greater warfare
readiness and more defence spending]{.underline}.

Yet the Euro-Atlantic alliance instigates conflict with its combat
troops along Russia's borders and its containment measures against
China. Space is a fragile global common that is already contaminated by
debris and should be protected, not weaponized.

[It is **[NATO]{.mark} that [is dangerously diverting]{.mark} our
[attention and resources to war and away]{.mark} from the grave threat
of global [warming]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[NATO members spend approximately \$1 trillion annually on their
militaries, which is more than 50 per cent of global military
spending.]{.underline} At the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales, members made a
commitment to spend 2 per cent of their GDP on defence by 2024 with 20
per cent of that amount to be on equipment.

At this year's London summit, [Canada was repeatedly admonished for not
spending enough on defence. However, the latest NATO expenditure report
shows that Canada spent \$29 billion on the Department of National
Defence]{.underline}, which is 1.31 per cent of GDP. On a cash basis,
Canada is now ranked 6th-highest among NATO members and 14th-highest in
the world for military spending.

By contrast, according to the Public Accounts of Canada, the federal
government spent only \$1.8 billion on the Department of Environment and
Climate Change, which is 0.08 per cent of GDP. Very little is allotted
to the principal department tasked with protecting our natural
environment.

Moreover, under the 2016 Pan-Canadian Framework for Clean Growth and
Climate Change, \$132 billion of new spending over the next 11 years was
announced by the federal and provincial governments. However, Canada's
2017 defence policy, Strong Secure Engaged, promised more than \$553
billion to maintain "high-end warfighting" to meet NATO's requirements.

[To stay interoperable, NATO members have to constantly upgrade their
military capabilities. This procurement primarily benefits the big U.S.
arms manufacturers,]{.underline} which is why President Trump pushes
alliance members to spend more on defence.

Yet fighter jets, attack helicopters, warships and armoured vehicles are
petroleum powered and notoriously energy inefficient. Within NATO
countries, it is the military that is the largest institutional consumer
of oil and largest emitter of greenhouse gases.

Worse, in Canada like [in]{.underline} other [[NATO members]{.mark}, the
armed forces [are exempted from reducing emissions from their
military]{.mark} vehicles and operations.]{.underline}

On the eve of the Madrid climate conference, the UN Secretary General
Antonio Guterres said, "Our war against nature must stop[." It is
[NATO]{.mark} that [is]{.mark} [perpetuating]{.mark} this [war against
nature by fuelling a carbon-intensive arms race]{.mark} and fomenting an
expensive new Cold War.]{.underline}

Unsurprisingly, [the recent UN emissions gap report explains that Canada
and the other **[NATO countries are not on track to limit the global
mean]{.mark} [temperature]{.mark}** [rise]{.mark} to 1.5C. This past
decade [while NATO has fought its deadly and destructive global]{.mark}
war on terror, [the planet has warmed to the hottest on]{.mark}
[record]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Shamefully, **[[NATO countries have also failed to meet their climate
financing commitments]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [These wealthy, polluting
countries have not adequately invested in the UN Green Climate Fund and
have pledged only a paltry \$7.5 billion over the next four years to
help poor, developing countries adapt to climate-induced droughts, fires
and flooding.]{.underline}

Outside the NATO Summit, thousands of people from across the United
Kingdom and Europe converged to call for the dissolution of the military
alliance and for greater climate action. In Canada, people demonstrated
in Toronto in solidarity against the NATO Association of Canada, an
institution funded by U.S. weapons giants Lockheed Martin and General
Dynamics.

As revealed by a recent YouGov poll, support for NATO is waning in key
member states: the U.K., France and Germany. People are starting to see
the military alliance as an aggressive, unaffordable anachronism that is
polluting the climate and impeding progress on the Paris Agreement.

**[[A]{.mark} rapid [reduction of g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse
[g]{.mark}ase[s and a robust green new deal are not possible with rising
military emissions and expenditures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[We must
work]{.mark} peacefully and cooperatively [through the UN
system]{.mark}]{.underline} with Russia, China and the entire
international community on solving our common security challenge ---
averting catastrophic climate change.

Catastrophic [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}

Though by no means certain, CCC [[causing global extinction]{.mark} is
possible [due to]{.mark} interrelated factors of [non-linearity,
cascading effects, positive feedbacks, multiplicative factors, critical
thresholds and tipping points]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. Barnosky and
Hadly, 2016; Belaia et al., 2017; Buldyrev et al., 2010; Grainger, 2017;
Hansen and Sato, 2012; IPCC 2014; Kareiva and Carranza, 2018; Osmond and
Klausmeier, 2017; Rothman, 2017; Schuur et al., 2015; Sims and Finnoff,
2016; Van Aalst, 2006).7

[A possibly [imminent tipping point]{.mark} could be in the [form of 'an
abrupt ice sheet collapse]{.mark} \[that\] could cause a [rapid sea
level rise']{.mark}]{.underline} (Baum et al., 2011, p. 399). [There are
many avenues for [positive feedback in]{.mark} global warming,
including: • [the replacement of]{.mark} an [ice]{.mark} sea by a liquid
ocean surface from melt[ing reduces the reflection]{.mark} and
[increases the absorption of sunlight, leading to faster
warming]{.mark}; • [the drying of forests]{.mark} from warming increases
forest fires [and the release of more carbon]{.mark}; and •
[higher]{.mark} [ocean temperatures]{.mark} may [lead to the release of
methane trapped]{.mark} under the ocean floor, [producing runaway global
warming.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Though there are also [avenues for negative feedback, the scientific
consensus is for an overall net positive feedback]{.underline} (Roe and
Baker, 2007). Thus, the Global Challenges Foundation (2017, p. 25)
concludes, 'The world is currently completely unprepared to envisage,
and even less deal with, the consequences of CCC'

[[The threat of sea-level rising]{.mark} from global warming [is well
known]{.mark}]{.underline}, but there are also other likely and more
imminent threats to the survivability of mankind and other living
things. For example, Sherwood and Huber (2010) emphasize the
adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress from high
environmental wet-bulb temperature. They show [that '[even
modest]{.mark} global [warming could]{.mark} \... [expose large]{.mark}
[fractions]{.mark} of the \[world\] population [to unprecedented heat
stress']{.mark}]{.underline} p. 9552 and [that with substantial global
warming, 'the area of and rendered uninhabitable by heat stress would
dwarf that affected by rising sea level']{.underline} p. 9555, [[making
extinction]{.mark} much more [likely]{.mark} and the relatively moderate
damages estimated by most integrated assessment models unreliably
low.]{.underline}

\*\*\*BRI=Belt and Road Initiative: A global infrastructure project
China created\*\*\*

Trans-Pacific View author Mercy Kuo regularly engages subject-matter
experts, policy practitioners, and strategic thinkers across the globe
for their diverse insights into U.S. Asia policy. This conversation with
Dr. Frans-Paul van der Putten -- senior research fellow at Clingendael
and co-coordinator of the Clingendael China Center in The Hague -- is
the 211th in "The Trans-Pacific View Insight Series."

Explain Brussels' strategic objectives for EU involvement in China's
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

[The [European]{.mark} Commission's first significant [response to the
BRI was]{.mark} its [agreement]{.mark}]{.underline} in September 2015
[with China to set up a bilateral Connectivity Platform. As part of this
platform, each year a high-level meeting takes place between the Chinese
government and the European Commission]{.underline}. These [[meetings
are aimed at improving Sino-EU cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} on
transport corridors within and between Europe and China[.]{.underline}
Although the connectivity platform continues to function, [it does not
appear to have resulted in any major practical instances of European
engagement with or involvement in the BRI.]{.underline}

In September 2018 [[the EU published its Connectivity Strategy for
Europe and Asia. This constituted a major shift]{.mark} in its approach
to the BRI. [The main aim]{.mark} of the EU's Connectivity Strategy [is
not engagement with China]{.mark}: the strategy document refers to China
only as one among many relevant parties and there is no mention of the
BRI at all. And yet the EU Connectivity Strategy is primarily a response
to the BRI, aimed at promoting a European alternative to the Chinese
approach. [The main concern of the E]{.mark}uropean [C]{.mark}ommission
[appears to relate to China's growing influence in the non-EU
countries]{.mark} of the Western Balkans, but to a lesser extent also to
Chinese influence within the EU, in particular in its eastern half, and
in Asia]{.underline}. [The Connectivity Strategy]{.underline} of the
European Union [entails technical cooperation on and financing of
cross-border infrastructure ̶ transport, energy and digital ̶ that is
based on the EU's competition, environmental, and transparency
standards]{.underline}. By taking this [approach the EU is not only
responding to the rise of China but also to the increasing importance of
great power politics to the detriment of international rules and
cooperation]{.underline}. Through its Connectivity Strategy the EU tries
to strengthen its economic and diplomatic involvement in Eastern Europe
and Asia, and its geopolitical relevance at the global level.

The EU took a further step in this direction in September 2019 when it
convened the Europa Connectivity Forum to bring together stakeholders
from a broad range of nationalities and sectors. The most important
outcome of this event was an agreement by the EU and Japan to commence a
bilateral "partnership on sustainable connectivity and quality
infrastructure." This agreement is aimed at improved coordination
between the EU and Japan in regard of their respective responses to
China's BRI.

The EU's strategic objectives in regard to the BRI combine engagement
with China on cross-border transportation, while pushing back China's
growing overall influence and strengthening the visibility and role of
the EU as an autonomous actor among other great powers.

What is the impact of the U.S.-China trade dispute on Germany and the
Netherlands as EU economic and export engines?

[[Uncertainty resulting from the U.S.-China trade
dispute]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with Brexit, [has [contributed
to]{.mark} the [difficulties that]{.mark} German [export-oriented
industries are currently experiencing.]{.mark} The German economy is
contracting and appears to be falling into a recession]{.underline}.
[Also, in the Netherlands exports and investments are suffering from the
dispute. Dutch economic growth]{.underline} remained stable in the first
half of 2019, but is [expected to decline]{.underline} in the second
half and beyond. Some Dutch companies have been directly affected by the
trade dispute. For instance, Philips recently announced that profits for
this year will be lower due to the trade dispute. The company produces
goods in the U.S. for the Chinese market and vice versa. Restructuring
its production base takes time and is costly.

Assess whether EU-U.S. tariff tensions would compel Brussels and Berlin
to rebalance toward China and Asia.

The EU and its member states are not likely to rebalance towards China
and Asia, but they are looking for ways to increase European "strategic
autonomy." [[Through NATO, the U.S. continues to be Europe's main
security provide]{.mark}r. Europe needs the U.S. as a
counterbalance]{.underline} to Russia. **[[As long as this remains so,
the EU and its member states will remain geopolitically much closer to
the U.S. than to China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Nevertheless, the
European Union is likely to look for ways to diminish its economic and
financial dependence on the United States. EU and U.S. interests are
often aligned but not always, and from a European point of view [the
U.S. is less dependable as a long-term partner than it used to
be.]{.underline} In my view, EU-U.S. tariff tensions are not a crucial
issue, but an escalation of U.S.-China geopolitical competition would
be. Potential [[U.S. pressure]{.mark},]{.underline} at some point in the
future[, [on Europe to decouple economically from China, to end
cooperation with China]{.mark}]{.underline} within international
organizations, or to participate in military activities directed against
China would probably create severe transatlantic tensions.

not formally part of BRI, would likely benefit in some ways if BRI
builds infrastructure that accelerates global economic growth.

Were U.S. companies able to sell equipment and material required in the
production, maintenance, or operation of the infrastructure built in BRI
countries, those U.S. firms would stand to profit. To the extent that
modern infrastructure lowers transportation and communications costs in
BRI countries, U.S. producers trading with and operating out of those
countries would also benefit. [Global [political stability usually

Liberals argue that [economic interdependence lowers the likelihood of
war by increasing the value of trading over the alternative of
aggression; interdependent states would rather trade than invade. As
long as high levels of interdependence can be maintained]{.underline},
liberals assert, [we have reason for optimism]{.underline} (Copeland,
1996, p. 5).

Liberals view that [increasing ties between countries in some fields
encourages them to achieve greater cooperation in other fields. These
linkages are supposed to strengthen communication and reduce
misunderstandings which may cause tension and creates cultural and
institutional mechanisms capable of mediating conflicts that may arise
between them. At the same time, mutual recognition of mutual benefits
enhances peace.]{.underline}

Liberals believe that economic relations between nations lead to peace,
with liberals pointing to three important points (Korbel and Chen, 2009,
p. 15):

[The costs of waging a war against state's economic partner are very
high because fighting against a partner with which the state trade and
invest, the state actually fights against itself because a war between
the state and its partner must have a negative effect on the state's
economy]{.underline}.

[Economic ties change states' preferences when economic ties between two
states become stronger and these two states become more economically
interdependent or even integrated, economic interests -- compared with
other national interests such as military buildup -- become the most
important.]{.underline}

[Strong economic ties make non-military threats such as economic
sanctions credible. Therefore, when there is a conflict between two
states that have strong economic ties, a non-military threat is more
likely to be the choice.]{.underline}

During the last four decades, China experienced impressive economic
growth, becoming one of the leading powers of the global economy. After
a century of humiliation imposed by Western and Japanese colonial
powers, today the country is demonstrating a strong desire to achieve
its national rejuvenation (guojia fuxing). Indeed, under the iconic
leadership of President Xi Jinping, China is adopting an increasingly
assertive international behavior, balancing the need to protect its
sovereignty and strategic interests related to economic and security
issues, and the ambition to restore its role of a great power\[1\]. In
this context, [the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) - a massive
infrastructure project to improve connectivity between the East and the
West, increase regional cooperation and facilitate trade and
investments - has been described as China's grand strategy championing
its global governance ambitions\[2\]. Indeed, BRI-participating
economies represent more than one-third of global GDP]{.underline}, and
over half of the world's population (OECD 2017).

From the perspective of the Western world, the BRI has been the most
highly debated, heavily criticized and poorly understood policy
framework of the 21st century. Considering that [**the European market
is the key strategic destination** for the BRI,]{.underline} the Chinese
project and a new manifestation of China's soft power have been
perceived as a threat to a global order shaped by the US' hegemony. In
the past two decades, China and the European Union, two of the three
largest economies in the world and major trading partners, increasingly
tightened their economic and political relations\[3\]. However[,
promising potential for cooperation is repeatedly undermined by major
political differences]{.underline} (Farnell & Crookes 2016[), and EU
member states failed to adopt a common response to the Chinese
initiative.]{.underline}

Main reasons behind the EU's skepticism about China's BRI

[The reasons explaining the weak engagement and scarce enthusiasm of the
EU towards the Chinese BRI are]{.underline} related to the lack of
mutual trust and a general sentiment of skepticism about China's
increased assertiveness, mainly [justified by the huge divide in terms
of values]{.underline}, ideologies and political systems. The BRI has
been presented as a strategic "bag" or "container" into which virtually
everything can be thrown (Yu 2018). Although the media and official
papers linked several projects to the BRI, like German and Polish
railway connections or the Piraeus port in Greece as the 21th century
Maritime Silk Road's access to the European Market\[27\], the links of
the BRI to Europe have not been clearly defined by China, resulting in
an unclear understanding by the EU of the role and the ambition of the
Chinese projects. Internally, the BRI is suffering from a lack of policy
and bureaucratic coordination (Yu 2018), reinforcing this lack of
clarity in the eyes of foreign investors and partners. Indeed, no clear
responsibilities have been assigned among central committees, local
government bodies, SOEs and so forth, and no clear framework or
guidelines have been designed to categorize BRI investments, creating
bureaucratic opaqueness and scarce transparency on how and who makes
decisions about BRI-related investments\[28\].

Also [considering the EU's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and its historical transatlantic partnership with
the US, the EU-China relationship and the EU approach to the BRI also
have important geopolitical implications in the balance of powers and
policy-making of these great powers. In today's global order, where new
rising powers like China are gradually weakening the US' hegemony and
creating an increasingly multilateral system, the EU's economy and
security are still very much dependent on the US.]{.underline} However,
considering also that the impact of the BRI on Sino-European economic
relations remains limited, the main significance of the BRI for
transatlantic relations is symbolic (Kuo 2019). In other words, the need
to show a single and strong voice to respond to Chinese assertiveness
and protect EU values and standards is aimed at avoiding potential
transatlantic frictions, even in the present historic moment where the
EU and the US have increasingly divergent interests and [the EU is
likely to diminish its economic and financial dependence on the US in
this new multilateral global order]{.underline}\[29\].

Background: China's Belt and Road Initiative

On 7 September 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping launched at Nazarbayev
University in Astana (Kazakhstan) the idea of building a new "economic
belt along the Silk Road"\[8\] to connect China, the Middle East and
Europe through economic and cultural corridors. Mainly framed as a
policy to promote friendship and people-to-people exchanges and build a
bright future by reinforcing multilateral collaboration and cultural
relationships in the region\[9\], the BRI is an ambitious and
China-sponsored project of massive infrastructure investments and trade
agreements aimed at improving connectivity along the Silk Road Economic
Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.

[China designed the BRI to achieve important national economic and
geopolitical objectives such as maintaining sustainable economic growth,
expanding its export markets for hi-tech sectors developed under "Made
in China 2025", escaping the middle-income trap and boosting the
economic development of its rural and internal regions. However,
defining the BRI as a mere strategy to build infrastructures and improve
trade connectivity would be absolutely reductive.]{.underline}

Thanks to its impressive economic growth, which started after its
opening up in 1979, China is today one of leading powers reshaping the
new 21st century world order and the dynamics of the global economy,
shifting the balance of power from the West to the East[. With the
ambition to replace today's global leadership vacuum, **China designed
the BRI as a vision to spread its benevolence around the world and build
a community of common destiny**. To build a diplomatic umbrella, China
used images and ideas aligned with Chinese strategic thoughts and
national narratives]{.underline}. Indeed, the country's rhetoric is
based on the idea of spreading unity and harmony and creating a new
"all-under-Heaven" \[10\] where every country can achieve prosperity
through win-win cooperation, trust and friendship.

Moreover, the ambitions behind the BRI cannot be fully explained without
referring to the charismatic leadership of President Xi Jinping and his
modern Chinese "philosophy" explained in a set of policies and ideas
titled "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for
a New Era". Since the beginning of his mandate, President Xi emerged as
a paramount leader, striving to achieve China's Dream through the
consolidation of his power. His political reform agenda and its
anti-corruption campaign reinforced the central role of the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) and consolidated his power by reducing internal
factional politics and critics. For instance, the constitutional reform,
which abolished the two-term limit of the presidential mandate, clearly
shows the desire to extend Xi's mandate beyond 2023. As a chairman of
the newly established National Security Commission and the Leading Small
Group for the Comprehensive Deepening of Reform, he de facto controls
strategic economic policies and decisions related to domestic and
external security, and as a Commander-in-Chief of the People's
Liberation Army, his role is strongly legitimized by the Chinese
military. It is not surprising [that the BRI has been widely described
as President Xi's flagship policy to reaffirm the role of China as a
great global power.]{.underline}

#### BRI increases the attraction of China as a geopolitical actor

Of course, [BRI is not just an economic exercise. The promise of
trillions of dollars in new investment and a reordering of production
networks on a regional basis will necessarily have significant political
effects]{.underline}. But what will they be? While it may appear obvious
that such a large venture would create political benefits for China, it
is worth examining how it might do so. [There are three main ways in
which economics translates into power: transactional power, structural
power, and "soft power]{.underline}."6 Here, I consider each, in turn,
as it applies to BRI.

[Transactional power]{.underline} is, at its core, a quid pro quo.In
economic terms, a transaction implies a price at which an exchange takes
place. This [makes for a fairly simple measure of power---having
sufficient resources to pay a counterpart the price it requires to forgo
its own preferred course of action in favor of the payer's preferred
course of action.]{.underline} In the political economy literature, such
[transactions are often referred to as "side payments," and are
described approvingly as a way to induce cooperation. More broadly, a
powerful actor can shape the behavior of its counterpart by promising
benefits for compliance or threatening consequences for
non-compliance.]{.underline} A classic example at the international
level is aid---by offering grant aid (or even loan aid, if it is
concessional or if the recipient is credit-constrained), the aid
provider may be able to affect either specific behaviors (e.g., an
infrastructure project that privileges firms based in the providing
country) or more indirectly buy "friendship," in the form of political
support or security cooperation.

[Many of the political analyses of BRI and AIIB focus on their potential
for providing China with substantially expanded transactional
power]{.underline}. The logic is simple[. On an absolute basis, China
will be providing large amounts of funding for infrastructure, which can
benefit the recipient, regardless of whether "recipient" is defined as
the economy, the government, particular interest groups, or even
specific individuals]{.underline}. From the point of view of the United
States and Japan, the relative dimension is, perhaps, equally important:
[assuming that neither the United States nor Japan will be ramping up
their own economic contributions to the same extent, **China's relative
attractiveness** as a political and economic partner would
grow.]{.underline} Moreover, [this effect would be compounded if Chinese
money were to come with fewer strings attached]{.underline}. (In
economic terms, this both lowers the cost of accepting funds, and
potentially increases the likelihood that the recipient's utility will
be increased because the projects chosen are more likely to reflect its
preferences than those of the providers.)

[BRI might also contribute to Chinese structural power---particularly
regionally, but also,]{.underline} perhaps[, globally]{.underline}. A
variety of scholars have written about structural power, with
occasionally differing emphases or understanding.7 While the definition
and measurement of structural power remain contested, [there are two
strands that are relevant to this discussion. The first can be
summarized as "dependence" or "entrapment]{.underline}." Drawing on
Albert Hirschman's analysis of pre-WWII German economic activities in
Central and Eastern Europe (particularly infrastructural development and
changing shares of trade and investment), [this strand argues that
economies that are particularly dependent on a much larger economy
become vulnerable to its blandishments and threats]{.underline}. In this
version of structural power, [because of the path dependence of some
economic activities such as connectivity, the stronger economy gains
enormous potential transactional power]{.underline}. Regardless of
whether threats are actually made or carried out, the [dependence of the
weaker economy tends to change its behavior to meet the preferences of
its stronger partner]{.underline}.

The other version of structural power operates at the systemic level. As
Gilpin and others have written, [this is a story of how the great powers
create rules and systemic incentives that shape the behavior of others
in the system]{.underline}. The classic example is the postwar global
system, whose rules and institutions (e.g., free trade and capitalism,
as embodied and supported by institutions like the International
Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization) profoundly shape
international and transnational interactions. These [institutions reward
compliance with prosperity and threaten obsolescence]{.underline} (what
Garrett and Lange call the "costs of closure") for states that reject
those norms and rules. [**The apotheosis of structural power is
hegemonic power**, where a single state has disproportionate influence
on the rules and institutions, affecting the behavior of every state and
economic actor in the system]{.underline}. A variety of Chinese official
pronouncements have suggested dissatisfaction with the existing,
US-created system, which suggests that China might seek to erode the
monopoly of the Bretton Woods institutions, and, thus, US global
hegemony. [The BRI]{.underline} and AIIB [could also be seen as an
attempt to create a regional order, in which China sets rules and norms
for neighbors]{.underline}, particularly in Central and Southeast Asia

[The final lens]{.underline} through which to analyze the effects of
OBOR and AIIB on China's regional power is the concept of "soft power."
Soft power has become a common and often misused term, with some writers
using it to describe nearly everything short of military action and
others valorizing the pursuit of likeability over interests. At its
core, however, [soft power is the ability to attract and persuade
others, i.e., to provide a model that is compelling enough to others
that they voluntarily choose actions or policies that are preferred by
the leading power]{.underline}. As Joseph Nye puts it: "It is the
ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or
payments. It arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture,
political ideals, and policies."8 In this conception, the power of the
United States rests at least to some extent on the attractiveness of its
culture, ideals, scientific accomplishments, material prosperity, or
other values besides its ability to reward or punish specific behavior
or to set the rules that others must follow. As Evelyn Goh has
perceptively written, international order cannot be understood only in
terms of leadership, but quite crucially as a relationship between the
leader(s) and followers.9 This is true of all forms of political power,
which are inherently relational, but the sentiments of followers are
particularly crucial to the operation of soft power.

#### The BRI is key to Chinese geoeconomics influence and hegemony

[The 'rise of China' or---more accurately---China's re-emergence as the
most important actor in what we now think of as East Asia is one of the
most important developments in world history.]{.underline} This may
strike some readers as an extravagant claim, but it is not without
foundation. Not only is [the economy of the People's Republic of China
(PRC) on track to overtake the United States' (US) as the world's
largest economy]{.underline} in the near future (Cheng and Lee 2021),
but [it is the first credible candidate to become a non-Western
hegemonic power.]{.underline} The fact that it is from Asia is
noteworthy enough; the idea that it is a 'communist' power that
subscribes to a very different idea about the best ways of organising
social, political, economic, and strategic activities is even more
remarkable. At the very least, [the PRC's ascension provides a striking
illustration of the possibility that very **different routes to global
power are conceivable**]{.underline}. The key questions in this context
are not just whether 'Chinese hegemony' is possible, but how it might
differ from the more familiar American variety that has dominated the
international system and the world views of nearly everyone alive today.

[To try and answer these questions, we focus on China's Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI). If successfully realised, the BRI will be the most
ambitious and expansive developmental project the world has ever
seen]{.underline}. While there has been an unsurprising flurry of
interest inside and outside China about the development of the BRI
(Beeson 2020a, b; Clarke 2017; Winter 2019), there have been few
attempts to place the BRI in comparative perspective, or to consider it
as an expression of possible hegemonic influence. Given that the BRI is
not unprecedented, this is surprising. After all, in the aftermath of
the Second World War, the US developed what was then an equally
unprecedented and ambitious initiative designed to simultaneously
facilitate the (re)development of some of the world's key economies and
reinforce its own position as the leader of the non-communist world
(Pollard 1985).

[Both the American Marshall Plan and China's BRI are, therefore,
important expressions of what has been described as '**geoeconomic'
influence and power**]{.underline} (Blackwill and Harris 2016; Luttwak
1990). In what follows, we compare the two projects to try and gauge the
prospects for the BRI and some of its associated institutions.
Significantly, the BRI lacks the same sort of compelling geopolitical
imperatives and narrative that the emerging Cold War provided for the US
and its allies (Gaddis 1982). At this point, at least, the Chinese
project also lacks the comprehensive institutional architecture that
facilitated American 'hegemonic' influence. Consequently, we argue that
it may prove more difficult for China to impose or develop the same sort
of coherent vision and geopolitical goals that the Americans did,
raising doubts about its long-term significance, despite its
unparalleled ambitions (Beeson 2009).

One common argument in Chinese analyses of the [BRI]{.underline} is that
regional integration [will contribute to a more stable security
environment, especially around China's southern and western
periphery]{.underline}. This argument both reflects and supports Xi's
broader vision for a new regional order---often described as a
"community of common destiny" or "community of shared interests"---in
which economic development and cooperative security reinforce each
other.27 China's 2017 white paper on Asia-Pacific security explains the
logic:

[Security and development are closely linked and mutually complementary.
Equal consideration should be given to both a security framework and an
economic framework---the main components of the entire regional
structure---to ensure their parallel development]{.underline}. On the
one hand, the [improvement of the security framework will help ensure a
peaceful and stable environment for economic development]{.underline};
on the other, [faster regional economic integration will provide solid
economic and social support for the development of the security
framework]{.underline}.28

[This is not an abstract goal but rather vital to the mitigation of a
range of security challenges]{.underline} within and [around China's
borders, including terrorism, separatism, and extremism]{.underline}
(known as the "three evils"), [territorial disputes with India in the
Himalayas]{.underline} and with several Southeast Asian nations in the
South China Sea, and the alleged fomenting of "color revolutions" by the
United States.29 Along these lines, Chinese scholars argue that the [BRI
can help improve stability in several ways]{.underline}:

[Mitigating the sources of violence in fragile states]{.underline}.
Retired Major General Wang Haiyun, a senior advisor at the China
Institute of International Strategic Studies (CIISS), claims that
[economic growth created by the BRI will "eradicate poverty," which is a
"root cause" of terrorism and extremism, and play a role in "diffusing
clashes of civilization that should actually never happen, and calming
the restless social sentiments of Islamic regions]{.underline}."30 This
could reduce perceived threats such as those posed by Uighur separatists
and militants of the so-called Islamic State (IS) infiltrating into
China.31

Ameliorating territorial disputes. Wang Junsheng, a scholar at the CASS
National Institute of International Strategy, argues that [the BRI will
help resolve territorial disputes in the South China Sea by moving
leaders away from a "zero sum" mindset]{.underline}. As evidence, he
claims that Vietnam's participation in BRI projects has lowered tensions
between Beijing and Hanoi in the South China Sea, and led to stronger
overall Sino-Vietnamese relations.32 Hu Bo, a research fellow at Beijing
University, similarly argues that one goal of the BRI is to alleviate
maritime disputes, though this does not imply that China will
"sacrifice" its "legal rights" to enforce territorial claims.33

Increasing mutual trust.34 Li Gang, a scholar at the Central Party
School's Institute of International Strategy, argues that the [BRI will
exhibit China's virtues of "openness, trustworthiness, inclusivity, and
development," and thus convince other states of its peaceful
intentions]{.underline}.35 Renmin University professor Wang Yiwei
likewise contends that trust gained through "civil and local
interactions" in creating the BCIM economic corridor will help Beijing
and New Delhi overcome historical suspicions.36

[Building more effective security partnerships]{.underline}. Central
Party School scholar Sun Xianpu argues that [China can expand CT
intelligence sharing, training, and technical exchanges under the BRI
framework, citing closer CT cooperation with Pakistan as an
example]{.underline}. Sun also anticipates greater cooperation in the
areas of counternarcotics in Southeast Asia, and counterpiracy in South
Asia.37 Senior Colonel Meng Xiangqing, a professor at the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) NDU, similarly argues that the BRI will lead to
closer CT cooperation among Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)
members, which is needed to address violent extremism and to stabilize
Afghanistan following a reduction of U.S. forces.38

[A weakness of the Chinese literature is that it tends to assert rather
than substantiate a causal relationship between development and
security]{.underline}. This tendency underscores official rhetoric
promoting the "community of common destiny," but ignores contentious
debates in international relations and policy circles about the linkages
between regional integration and conflict. Many studies, of course,
support the argument that regional trade integration helps reduce
conflict.39 Others, however, have found either no relationship or
suggest that high levels of economic interdependence could even increase
the chance of interstate militarized disputes in some cases.40 Moreover,
[Chinese analyses often fail to consider how regional integration may be
increasing transnational security threats, such as facilitating
international crime.41]{.underline} By ignoring these perspectives,
China's security community might not have adequately considered the
possible externalities of BRI projects.

Relations, China Foreign Affairs University. ("China's rise will restore
history of peaceful benefits for its neighbors," The Global Times.

Early this year, a special seven-part series of documentary titled Super
China, which was produced by the state-run Korean Broadcasting System,
have sparked South Korean discussions about the \"China threat.\"

The \"China threat\" theory has been widely circulated and constantly
hyped by Western countries during China\'s rise and is often cited by
China\'s neighboring countries. It typically reflects the Western
thinking of realpolitik in international relations.

In fact, be it in history or in the current stage, [a powerful China has
never posed a threat to the peace and stability of its neighboring
countries or the whole world, but instead it has created a positive
influence.]{.underline}

People may infer that a mighty China will manifest its identity by all
means based on their memory of the Middle Kingdom or the tributary
system.

However, looking back[, China in its powerful times was always favorable
to others in economic ties, adhered to the principle of benevolence in
political relations and was cautious about resorting to
force.]{.underline} Having been through harsh humiliation in recent
history, today\'s [China holds firmly that one should not impose his or
her beliefs on anyone else.]{.underline}

Today, [a rising China is determined to guide and exercise its relations
with the outside world by using new diplomatic mind-set focused on
win-win cooperation. China has realized that if a country wants to seek
development, security and well-being, it has to allow others to have
them]{.underline}.

It is out of this concept that [China has taken on more and more duties
as a big power to safeguard the prosperity and stability in the region
and the world]{.underline}.

While [China has proposed to build a new type of major power
relationship, it also adopts the principles of closeness, sincerity,
sharing in prosperity and inclusiveness in fostering neighborhood
relations to make neighbors benefit from China\'s development. China has
become the largest trade partner and export destination and exporter of
many neighboring countries.]{.underline}

[China has proactively joined the efforts to address global issues that
range from the UN peacekeeping missions, prevention and treatment of
infectious diseases, climate change, non-proliferation of mass
destruction weapons to a series of regional hot-spot
issues]{.underline}. Its roles are highly recognized.

China remains a developing country faced with arduous development
problems and needs a stable international environment. It means a lot
for China to prevent the world from falling into violence and tumult.

[A weak China will actually serve as a threat to the neighborhood
stability]{.underline}. China\'s feebleness in recent history not only
invited a century-long humiliation for itself, but it also drew in the
countries around. [If China with its more than 1.3 billion population is
still mired in poverty and turbulence or even undergoes internal
collapse, the resulting problems of refugees and emigrants will pose a
threat to the neighborhood and the rest of the world]{.underline}.

As President Xi Jinping noted in his speech at the Moscow State
Institute of International Relations in 2013, a well-developed China
with over 1.3 billion people will bring tangible benefits to the world.
On the contrary, if China becomes feeble, it will be a matter of grave
concern for the world.

The rising might of a country can\'t decide whether it will bring
threats or opportunities to the outside world. The key lies in the
diplomatic mind-set it advocates and in what ways it carries out its
diplomacy.

[Today, the European Union, as the final destination of the BRI and a
key targeted export market for Chinese products, has critical strategic
importance for the success of this ambitious Chinese project. Although
the ports of Piraeus in Greece and Venice in Italy have been indicated
in the official maps as the main end points of the BRI, it still remains
unclear whether Chinese interests could be further expanded into other
routes and whether other terminals will be targeted as entry points in
the EU and the Mediterranean]{.underline}\[15\].

In 2015, Hungary was the first European country to sign a MoU with China
under the BRI and, by 2019, another 22 European countries had signed BRI
co-operation agreements, with the latest being Luxembourg and
Italy\[16\]. However, leaders of countries like France and Germany,
which refused to officially participate in the BRI, adopted a more
cautious approach and expressed their concerns about the
Chinese-sponsored project. In particular, they advocated for more
balanced rules to avoid a "one-way trade road" and the increase of
China's influence in the Balkans\[17\].

In 2013, the same year the BRI was launched, the EU and China adopted
the "EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation", calling for
increased cooperation to promote peace, prosperity, sustainable
development and people-to-people exchanges\[18\]. Nonetheless, in [2015
the EU launched the "EU-China Connectivity Platform", the European
Commission's first significant response to the BRI]{.underline} (Kuo
2019). Established by the European Commission and the National
Development and Reform Commission of China, this bilateral platform was
aimed at improving transparency, reciprocity in market access and a
level playing field for businesses in the area of transport
infrastructure, as well as enhancing synergies between the EU's
connectivity projects, including the Trans-European Transport Network
(TEN-T)\[19\] and China's Belt and Road Initiative\[20\]. The main
tangible result of this platform relates to the organization of annual
high-level meetings bringing together chairpersons and expert groups
from both sides to foster their collaboration on transport
infrastructure projects. [However, although the connectivity platform
continues to function, it does not appear to have resulted in any major
practical instances of European engagement with or involvement in the
BRI]{.underline} (Kuo 2019).

### finland/sweden turn

#### Turkey objects to NATO membership for Finland and Sweden now [but]{.underline} the plan smooths out relations among NATO allies and allows them to join

**Turak 5/17.** Natasha, Correspondent, CNBC. "WORLD POLITICS 'The

membership for Sweden and Finland"

JH-NCP

Why is this so crucial?

[[Sweden and Finland are on the brink of applying for membership in
NATO]{.mark}, after the governments of both countries expressed their
support for the move]{.underline} [to abandon their traditional
positions of nonalignment]{.underline} between the alliance and Russia.

[This would expand the Western defense organization's clout and
territory and make a dramatic statement in pushing back against Russia,
and [has]{.mark} already [**spurred anger and threats** from
Moscow]{.mark}. ]{.underline}Sweden and [Finland]{.underline} are
members of the EU, but not NATO, and the latter [shares an 830-mile
border with Russia.]{.underline}

[The two countries joining NATO would give Moscow "more **officially
registered opponents**,"]{.underline} [its former president and
high-ranking security official Dmitry Medvedev warned]{.underline} in
mid-April.

[[But NATO ascension]{.underline}]{.mark} for a new member state
[[requires consensus]{.mark} approval [from all]{.mark} existing
[members]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[While NATO's leadership has welcomed the news]{.underline}, suggesting
the applicants could be accepted into the group quickly, [[one]{.mark}
of its most militarily **powerful members stan[ds in the way:
Turkey.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Turkey]{.underline}, which joined the alliance in 1952, [is a crucial
player in NATO, boasting the second-largest military in the 30-member
group after the United States.]{.underline}

[For both Sweden and Finland, the decision to apply for NATO membership
is monumental and was triggered by Russia's brutal invasion of its
neighbor Ukraine,]{.underline} which itself had aspirations to join
NATO. [Not until after the invasion did public opinion in both countries
soar in favor of joining the 73-year-old defense alliance.]{.underline}

[[The stake]{.mark}s here [are]{.mark} now
[massive]{.mark},"]{.underline} Timothy Ash, emerging markets strategist
at Bluebay Asset Management, said in a note Tuesday[. "It [feels like
**a major crisis is looming in Turkey-Western**]{.mark} **relations over
Finland and Sweden's NATO bid**."]{.underline}

["[Other NATO members will be furious with Turkey]{.mark} given the now
clear and present danger to Europe presented by Putin in
Ukraine,]{.underline}" Ash added. "[[Turkey will be seen]{.mark} an an
[unreliable]{.mark} partner. This will leave even more bad blood/faith
between the two sides]{.underline} --- gone will be any remnants of a
Turkish EU accession bid."

Turkey's highly strategic Incirlik air base is home to 50 of the U.S.′
tactical nuclear weapons, which some U.S. officials have suggested
removing due to increasing tensions with Washington and Ankara in recent
years. Those tensions were centered partly on Erdogan's warming ties
with Russian President Vladimir Putin and its controversial decision to
purchase Russia's S-400 air defense system, which saw it kicked out of
NATO's F-35 program.

While Turkey has supported Ukraine by sending it weapons, in particular
its lethal Bayraktar drones, and has tried to mediate between Moscow and
Kyiv, it has so far refused to join its NATO allies in sanctioning
Russia.

Just tough talk?

[[Some analysts are skeptical of Erdogan's tough talk,]{.mark}
[convinced he won't actually block]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [NATO membership
bids]{.mark} --- rather, they predict he will simply use his country's
leverage to extract concessions and boost his own waning
popularity]{.underline} at home.

"Despite its objections, Ankara will not block the countries' entry into
NATO," analysts at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group wrote in a
research note late Monday.

"Erdogan is likely looking for concessions for green-lighting NATO's
expansion, mainly from Sweden. These might include the easing of
Stockholm's bilateral arms embargo on Turkey and some recognition of PKK
as a terrorist organization to curtail its fund-raising and recruitment
activities," the note said.

[[Erdogan's top foreign policy adviso]{.mark}r, Ibrahim Kalin, over the
weekend [reassured allies]{.mark} [by saying]{.mark}]{.underline} in an
interview with Reuters: "[[We are not closing the door]{.mark}. But [we
are]{.mark} basically [raising this issue as a matter of national
security for Turkey,]{.mark}" concerning NATO accession]{.underline}
[for Sweden and Finland.]{.underline}

Weapons deals will likely play an important role in whatever
negotiations take place. The Biden administration is currently seeking
approval from Congress to finalize a sale of F-16 fighter jets to
Turkey, for which Ankara will likely seek assurances.

But a more pressing reason behind Erdogan's brinksmanship may be the
need to boost his weakening popularity domestically, amid an inflation
and cost-of-living crisis. Opinion polls in Turkey have hit their lowest
in years.

Turkish inflation hit an eye-watering 70% in April, due in large part to
years of refusal by Erdogan to raise interest rates while burning
through currency reserves. The country of 84 million has been hit hard
by the global rise in the cost of energy and basic goods, with fuel and
agricultural commodity prices skyrocketing thanks in part to Russia's
invasion of Ukraine.

"There are two things which rally the nation in Turkey," Ash wrote.
"Opposition to the PKK and perceived Western hypocrisy."

#### Finland membership causes destabilization, miscalculation and the expansion of hybrid warfare -- extinction

fellow at the Center for a New American Security. "With Finland poised
to join NATO, how will Russia respond?"

JH-NCP

INSKEEP: A strange question to ask, I suppose, given the rhetoric of the
last several months, but I\'m going to ask it.
[[Does]{.underline}]{.mark} Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} really [care about
NATO expansion?]{.mark}]{.underline} And here\'s why I say this. [He
gave NATO expansion as a reason for invading Ukraine, but he seemed to
have all these other reasons for invading Ukraine about history and
Ukraine being a part of Russia and his idea of Russia. Does he even care
if Finland joins NATO really?]{.underline}

KENDALL-TAYLOR: [Yeah, I do think [he cares.]{.mark}]{.underline} I
mean, for a very long time - [[Finland has been neutral for 80
years]{.mark}.]{.underline} I think [both the Finns and the Russians
view that neutrality as one reason why they\'ve had such a stable and
pragmatic relationship. So this is really a sea change, and]{.underline}
I would expect that [**[this will lead to a fundamental change]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} [that]{.mark} historically [very stable Russia-Finnish
relationship]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And, you know[, it [could lead to
t]{.mark}hings like the [greater militarization along that
border]{.mark} there. So it will be consequential.]{.underline} And for
[Putin]{.underline}, it does underscore this idea, this fear that he
[has long held that Russia is being encircled by NATO. And so it will
amplify those concerns.]{.underline}

INSKEEP: Well, let\'s talk about years to come then. As [that border
gets more militarized, as the relationship maybe gets more and more
tense, Finland becomes a NATO nation, which means the U.S. would be
obliged to defend it if it were attacked. Does this, at least a little
bit, increase the risk that the United States might have to go to war
sometime?]{.underline}

KENDALL-TAYLOR: Well, we know that - you know, that [when [Putin]{.mark}
looks at NATO, he views it as a credible military force. He [understands
that Russia cannot compete with NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} And it\'s one
of the reasons why Putin, too, has been so reticent to risk a direct
military confrontation in Ukraine with NATO. And so, you know, does it
increase the risk? I would say so just because [we will see kind of
NATO\'s infrastructure closer to Russia\'s border. [If **we do see
things like the militarization of that border**, it raises the risk of
**accidents that could unintentionally spiral into
conflict**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And I think [[that would be the most
likely pathway]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather than a Russia that feels it
would want to take on NATO as an adversary.

INSKEEP: We just got about 20 seconds here, but I\'ll ask this also.
[[If]{.mark} [Putin wanted to widen this conflict somehow]{.mark}, what

The recent intervention in Libya, ostensibly with the United States
following the Europeans' lead, actually proved the indispensability of
American military power. [Since 9/11, as the NATO "free rider" problem
got worse with American defense budgets exploding and those of allied
countries contracting, the gap between U.S. and allied military
capabilities has widened]{.underline}. In Libya, [the Americans had to
undertake the heavy lifting of initially knocking down the Libyan air
defenses. After the United States set up the allies to take over
airstrikes, it then had to provide surveillance, intelligence,
logistics, and refueling for allied air operations]{.underline}. The
meager allied surveillance capability is the reason President Obama
wants NATO to buy five Global Hawk surveillance drones.

And the [free riding is not going to get any better with the Europeans
in worse fiscal shape---at least for the moment---than the United
States. Thus, the Europeans will continue to enjoy a U.S. nuclear and
conventional shield while not even fully opening their markets to
American goods and services]{.underline}---as has always been the case
in the post--World War II world. [American defense contractors do get a
little back from the Europeans, as do U.S. policymakers, who get vague
"influence" in European capitals, but the American taxpayer, as usual,
gets the short end of the stick by funding the defense of countries that
can afford to do so themselves.]{.underline}

As NATO's Afghanistan mission winds down, [to save money to prevent its
own financial meltdown, the United States needs to withdraw from the
alliance and let Europe defend itself from a now manageable
threat]{.underline}. [Alas, the United States seems unable to give up
its addiction to meddling in and attempting to control the affairs of
Europe.]{.underline}

### china deterrence turn 

#### US troops need to be focused on Taiwan -- prevents China escalation in the SCS 

**Feng 6/1/22** (John Feng is a contributing editor for Newsweek in
their Asian research department, "Will China Invade Taiwan?"
<https://www.newsweek.com/china-taiwan-invasion-joe-biden-1711647>
)//MargaretE

Chen believes [Xi will secure an unprecedented third term in office this
November,]{.underline} but says the legitimacy of his rule \"will be
greatly challenged\" as a result of an economic downturn, created in
part by Xi\'s sweeping zero-COVID policy. [\"This mounting internal
pressure is pushing Xi and the CCP leadership to divert internal
opposition through more external aggression]{.underline},\" Chen says.
\"There are signs that [China will escalate and cause
conflicts,\"]{.underline} she notes. This is the backdrop against which
Biden\'s comments should be read. [That China will \"go the military
route on Taiwan\" isn\'t an inevitability]{.underline}, argues Bryce
Barros, an analyst with the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a think
tank at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. \"However, I do
think hawks within [the CCP and PLA might become more emboldened to take
military action against Taiwan in some way as it becomes more apparent
that Taiwan will not peacefully unify,\"]{.underline} he says.
[Taiwan\'s public has shown little interest in being governed from
Beijing]{.underline}, and its government has gradually increased the
country\'s defense spending in recent years. Clear commitments from
Washington, like the one given by Biden, may reinforce China\'s belief
that the U.S. plans to foil any military action by Beijing, Barros says.
[Whether China invades Taiwan will revolve around the central theory of
deterrence]{.underline}, chiefly as it pertains to the United States,
postwar Asia\'s foremost power. [To deter Beijing from a course of
military action, both Taipei and Washington will need to have a clear
understanding of Chinese interests and motives, and seek to shape
China\'s own perceptions of a potential attack by raising the costs of
war.]{.underline} According to Washington-based defense analyst Gerald
Brown, a [**commitment to defend Taiwan on paper isn\'t enough---it must
be matched by capabilities.** \"We definitely need to worry about having
the capability to beat back a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and we must
actively ensure we rapidly work towards this,\"]{.underline} he tells
Newsweek. \"Simultaneously, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is already
incredibly difficult and costly for the PRC, and while **[U.S. forces
are not where they need to be]{.underline}**, a U.S.-Chinese war is
something the PRC desperately wants to avoid if possible,\" says Brown,
who advocates \"strategic clarity\" to reinforce deterrence. \"Now,
having the capability is critical here, but, if the CCP is unsure that
the U.S. would step in and it has no commitment to do so, not having the
proper capability to defend Taiwan plus having room to back out would
actually serve as a far less effective deterrent,\" he says. \"[The CCP
may well assume that without a definitive capability to defend Taiwan
and with the lack of a formal commitment allowing room for the U.S. to
maneuver out and not defend Taiwan, if the PRC launched an attack the
U.S. would be compelled to stay out, encouraging Chinese
aggression,\"]{.underline} Brown says.

)//MargaretE

Although [there is growing concern about a possible
invasion]{.underline}, the timeframe of any military action --- and
China's real intentions --- are still the subject of intense debate.
[The year Davidson sees as the potential time horizon for a Chinese
attack, 2027, is the centenary of the People's Liberation
Army]{.underline}. In November 2020, [the Chinese Communist party said
it wanted to "ensure that the 100-year military building goal is
achieved by 2027", called for faster military modernisation and
reiterated the goal of making the Chinese military fit for networked,
"intelligentised" warfare.]{.underline} Although those are stock phrases
China has used before, [the Pentagon calls 2027 a "new milestone". "If
realised, the PLA's 2027 modernisation goals could provide Beijing with
more credible military options in a Taiwan contingency,"]{.underline} it
said in its annual report on the Chinese military last year. Some
analysts doubt Davidson's date. But one year on from his testimony,
**[government and military officials in both Taipei and Washington say
the window from now to 2027 is a genuine threat.]{.underline}** Last
October, [Taiwan's defence minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said the PLA would
have the "complete capability" to attack Taiwan by 2025.]{.underline}
["The current situation is really the most dangerous I have seen in my
more than 40 years]{.underline} in the military," he told lawmakers.
Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, recently told
Congress that the threat to Taiwan was "acute" between now and 2030 ---
lending credence to Davidson's sense of urgency. John Aquilino, the
current head of Indo-Pacific command, recently told the FT that [the
invasion of Ukraine underscored that the Chinese threat to Taiwan was
not abstract.]{.underline} Taiwanese **[experts see 2024 and 2025 as a
particularly dangerous period]{.underline}**. They believe [Xi might be
tempted to use force if the ruling Democratic Progressive party, which
insists on preserving Taiwan's de facto independence, wins
again]{.underline} in the next presidential election in early 2024, or
if he senses a political vacuum in the US after its next presidential
election in late 2024.

#### NATO response to China fails -- their focus is too narrow and article 5 mutual defense ensures Taiwan war escalates 

**Binnendijk 2021** (Hans Binnendijk is a distinguished fellow at the
Atlantic Council. He previously served as the U.S. National Security
Council's senior director for defense and arms control and as director
of the National Defense University's Institute for National Strategic
Studies, "NATO's focus on China is too narrow",
<https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2021/04/03/natos-focus-on-china-is-too-narrow/>
)//MargaretE

At the recent NATO foreign ministers' meeting, China was on the front
burner. [Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg noted that China is not
considered by NATO to be an adversary, but that China's rise has direct
consequences for alliance security.]{.underline} U.S. Secretary of State
Antony Blinken listed China first when speaking of major power threats
to other countries. [China will have a prominent place in NATO's
emerging new Strategic Concept.]{.underline} [But many of America's
trans-Atlantic partners still take a fairly narrow view of China's
military impact on the alliance.]{.underline} The focus tends to be on
security aspects of Chinese investments in European infrastructure, the
vulnerability of defense supply chains containing material made in
China, the consequences of Chinese technology embedded in communications
systems, China's political influence in Eastern and Southeastern Europe,
and small-scale Chinese naval exercises in European waters. Europe is
now taking constructive steps to deal with many of these critical
problems, but NATO also needs to open its aperture beyond Europe as it
assesses the broader security challenge posed by China. A report
released recently by the Atlantic Council, called "The China Plan: A
Transatlantic Blueprint for Strategic Competition," makes the case that
[this Euro-centric view misses four interrelated elements that could
have a profound impact]{.underline} on NATO. First, the United States
will increasingly focus on China as the pace-setter for its own military
modernization. China's defense budget measured in purchasing power
parity may soon approach that of the United States. China's time and
distance advantages, its focus on a naval and missile buildup, and its
growing tactical nuclear capabilities have already created a major
challenge for America's forces in the Indo-Pacific theater. **[With
future U.S. defense budgets likely to be flat, at best, America's
defense priorities may need to concentrate on China.]{.underline}** The
European theater may get less attention than when Russia presented the
primary major power threat. Next, the ever-growing Sino-Russian defense
relationship portends further difficulties for the alliance. While a
formal Sino-Russian defense alliance may not be in the cards for now,
the two nations are toying with the idea. Last year[, Russian President
Vladimir Putin said that "we don't need it \[an alliance\], but,
theoretically, it's quite possible to imagine it." China reacted warmly.
The two nations hold multiple joint military exercises and conduct
intense defense-industrial cooperation. Russia's ability to produce
military platforms coupled with Chinese digital capabilities will
provide both nations with better weapons systems to confront America's
allies]{.underline}. And having strong Chinese support, Russia may
become more assertive in its military activities in Europe. Third,
[Chinese behavior in the global commons plus the security implication of
China's Belt and Road Initiative, its Polar Silk Road, and its Digital
Silk Road all have negative consequence for Europe beyond
NATO]{.underline}'s borders. [Whether it is efforts to limit freedom of
the seas, malign cyber behavior, creating digital dependencies or
growing anti-satellite capabilities, the challenges China poses in the
global commons are relevant to all trans-Atlantic partners.]{.underline}
Regarding the Belt and Road Initiative, investments and debt traps
create coerced political influence. Along the Polar Silk Road,
investments in resources and science are laying the groundwork for
greater future Chinese involvement. Finally, and perhaps most important,
**[aggressive Chinese sovereign claims in the South and East China seas
and on Taiwan could lead to unwanted conflict between the United States
and China]{.underline}**. Should this happen, [Europe would be far from
immune.]{.underline} [A Sino-American war would probably not be
regionally contained, as were America's previous Asian wars in Korea and
Vietnam.]{.underline} [At a minimum, Europe would find itself in a
costly economic confrontation with China]{.underline}. NATO's mutual
defense clause, [Article 5, could be triggered.]{.underline} [And the
United States would probably need to pivot significant military assets
to Asia, leaving Europe more vulnerable]{.underline} to Russian
adventurism. Several suggestions for NATO flow from these four broader
concerns. [Europe should enhance its own military capabilities so that
Europe has effective defenses]{.underline}, should conflict in Asia
divert U.S. forces. Europe should contribute to deterrence in Asia by
clarifying to China that NATO allies would, at a minimum, take political
and economic action should China attack U.S. forces in Asia. NATO needs
to seek ways to help defend international freedoms in the global
commons. Europe should limit further Chinese strategic investments in
NATO countries that would stall NATO decision-making or mobilization
during a crisis. And NATO needs to create new mechanisms to strengthen
its ties to America's Asian allies. These steps are in Europe's
interest. They need not be seen as belligerent, but rather steps to
avoid Chinese miscalculation and to further deter Russia. [They can be
combined with U.S.-European Union-China cooperative measures in areas
like managing global warming, fighting pandemics and reducing nuclear
proliferation.]{.underline}

#### US needs to shift focus away from NATO and towards China -- now is key 

**Chellaney 2022** (Brahma Chellaney, Professor of Strategic Studies at
the New Delhi-based Center for Policy Research and Fellow at the Robert
Bosch Academy in Berlin, is the author of Water, Peace, and War:
Confronting the Global Water Crisis (Rowman & Littlefield, 2013),
"America is Focusing on the Wrong Enemy",

)//MargaretE

This may explain why US President Joe **[Biden is treating a "rogue"
Russia as a peer competitor, when he should be focused on the challenge
from America's actual peer, China.]{.underline}** In comparison to
Russia, [China's population is about ten times bigger, its economy is
almost ten times larger, and its military expenditure is around four
times greater. Not only is China more powerful; it genuinely seeks to
supplant the US as the preeminent global power]{.underline}. By
contrast, with its military buildup on Ukraine's borders, Russia is
seeking to mitigate a perceived security threat in its neighborhood.
Hastening the decline of US global leadership is hardly the preserve of
Democrats. [A bipartisan parade of US leaders has failed to recognize
that the post-Cold War unipolar world order, characterized by
unchallenged US economic and military predominance, is long
gone.]{.underline} The US squandered its "unipolar moment," especially
by waging an expensive and amorphous "Global War on Terrorism,"
including several military interventions, and through its treatment of
Russia. [After its Cold War victory, the US essentially took an extended
victory lap, pursuing strategic maneuvers that flaunted its dominance.
Notably, it sought to expand NATO to Russia's backyard]{.underline}, but
made little effort to bring Russia into the Western fold, as it had done
with Germany and Japan after World War II. The souring of relations with
the Kremlin contributed to Russia's eventual remilitarization. [So,
while the US remains the world's foremost military power, it has been
stretched thin by the decisions and commitments it has made, in Europe
and elsewhere, since 1991.]{.underline} This goes a long way toward
explaining why the US has ruled out deploying its own troops to defend
Ukraine today. What the US is offering Ukraine -- weapons and ammunition
-- cannot protect the country from Russia, which has an overwhelming
military advantage. [But US leaders made another fatal mistake since the
Cold War: by aiding China's rise, they helped to create the greatest
rival their country has ever faced.]{.underline} Unfortunately, they
have yet to learn from this. Instead, [the US continues to dedicate
insufficient attention and resources to an excessively wide array of
global issues]{.underline}, from Russian revanchism and Chinese
aggression [to lesser threats]{.underline} in the Middle East and Africa
and on the Korean Peninsula. [And it continues inadvertently to bolster
China's global influence, not least through its overuse of
sanctions.]{.underline} For example[, by barring friends and allies from
importing Iranian oil, two successive US administrations enabled China
not only to secure oil at a hefty discount, but also to become a top
investor in -- and security partner of -- the Islamic
Republic.]{.underline} US [sanctions have similarly pushed resource-rich
Myanmar into China's arms.]{.underline} As Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen, whose country has faced a US arms embargo over its ties to China,
asked last year, "If I don't rely on China, who will I rely on?" Russia
has been asking itself the same question. [Though Russia and China kept
each other at arm's length for decades, US-led sanctions introduced
after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea drove President Vladimir Putin
to pursue a closer strategic partnership with China]{.underline}. The
bilateral relationship is likely to deepen, regardless of what happens
in Ukraine. But the raft of harsh new sanctions the US has promised to
implement in the event of a Russian invasion will accelerate this shift
significantly, with China as the big winner. The heavy financial
penalties the US has planned -- including the "nuclear option" of
disconnecting Russian banks from the international SWIFT payments system
-- would turn China into Russia's banker, enabling it to reap vast
profits and expand the international use of its currency, the renminbi.
If Biden fulfilled his pledge to block the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline,
which is set to deliver Russian supplies directly to Germany via the
Baltic Sea, China would gain greater access to Russian energy. In fact,
by securing a commitment from Putin this month to a nearly tenfold
increase in Russian natural gas exports, China is building a safety net
that could -- in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan -- withstand
Western energy sanctions and even a blockade. China could also benefit
militarily by demanding greater access to Russian military technology in
exchange for its support. [For the US, a strengthened Russia-China axis
is the worst possible outcome of the Ukraine crisis]{.underline}. The
best outcome would be a compromise with Russia to ensure that it does
not invade and possibly annex Ukraine. **[By enabling the US to avoid
further entanglement in Europe, this would permit a more realistic
balancing of key objectives -- especially checking Chinese
aggression]{.underline}** in the Indo-Pacific -- with available
resources and capabilities. **[The future of the US-led international
order will be decided in Asia, and China is currently doing everything
in its power to ensure that order's demise.]{.underline}** Already,
China is powerful enough that it can host the Winter Olympics even as it
carries out a genocide against Muslims in the Xinjiang region, with
limited pushback. **[If the Biden administration does not recognize the
true scale of the threat China poses, and adopt an appropriately
targeted strategy soon, whatever window of opportunity for preserving US
preeminence remains may well close.]{.underline}**

#### NATO fails to deter China -- lack of focus and planning capabilities 

**Odgaard 2022** (Lisa Odgaard is a professor at the Norwegian Institute
for Defense Studies in Oslo and a non-resident senior fellow at the
Hudson Institute focusing on US-China-Europe relations, NATO's China

**[NATO's vague recognition in 2021 that China constitutes a challenge
to the transatlantic alliance reflects an institution that has failed to
take on the security threats emanating from Beijing]{.underline}**.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 highlights the reasons
why [this omission is problematic.]{.underline} [The war in Ukraine has
reignited transatlantic unity of purpose in addressing threats from
Moscow toward European security.]{.underline} The existential shock that
Europe is facing now that a Russian regime has shown itself willing to
go to war against European countries carries with it the risk that
[China will be forgotten when NATO discusses its future
priorities.]{.underline} During the war, China is walking a tightrope
between maintaining its commitment to sovereignty and territorial
integrity and keeping up cooperation with Russia. The future strength of
the Chinese-Russian partnership is likely to be determined by the
continued usefulness of Moscow in China's efforts to carve out more
space for a Sinocentric international order based on authoritarian
regimes. Meanwhile, [China will continue to engender threats to the US
and Europe in all domains and across geographical regions]{.underline}.
With the summit statement of the North Atlantic Council released June
14, 2021, NATO extended a commitment to "engage China with a view to
defending the security interests of the Alliance," since "China's stated
ambitions and assertive behavior present systemic challenges to the
rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance
security."1 China's coercive policies, nuclear arsenal, military
modernization, military cooperation with Russia, lack of transparency,
and use of disinformation are listed as main areas of concern for the
alliance[. NATO]{.underline} takes the China challenge seriously but
[has yet to devise a strategy to address it.]{.underline} Compared to
the United States[, Europe took a long time to acknowledge its stake in
managing security challenges from China.]{.underline} As Beijing pushed
beyond its traditional zones of interest in East and Southeast Asia
toward the Indian Ocean in the 2000s, US security policies began to
focus more on China as Washington sought a new geopolitical equilibrium
in Asia.2 Since 2014, France and the UK have spearheaded Europe's naval
diplomacy to counter the displays of force and increasing tensions in
maritime Asia to which China contributes. This engagement has focused on
regular exercises with the US and its Asian allies, operations in
support of freedom of navigation, and base-sharing agreements. 3 In
2021, [the EU recognized that these geopolitical dynamics directly
impact its security and announced the establishment of supportive
mechanisms in its Indo-Pacific strategy.]{.underline}4 However, [NATO
has been conspicuously absent in these transatlantic endeavors designed
to counter challenges to US and European security.]{.underline}
Reflecting NATO's absence from the main arena of US-China strategic
competition, [the alliance is hardly ever mentioned in off-the-record
conversations on Indo-Pacific security between diplomats and think tank
personnel. NATO's reluctance to take on the China challenge is perhaps
not surprising, given its inherent assumption that the European
continent is the jewel in the crown of the US alliance
system,]{.underline} which is thought to guarantee US assistance in the
event of a military threat against Europe. This assumption was
challenged during the Trump administration, which openly questioned the
US commitment to Article Five's collective defense obligation. The
invasion of Ukraine has given NATO a new lease on life and put it at the
frontlines of transatlantic cooperation on deterring Russia from further
military action in future. However, [**NATO's focus on its eastern
frontline carries the risk that the alliance turns into a Russia-focused
European institution and ignores that China is a global great power
competitor which also constitutes a major challenge to the security of
all NATO member states.** Washington increasingly looks to the EU rather
than NATO for guidance]{.underline} on Europe's future security policy.
One reason is that NATO's toolbox is lagging in domains such as cyber
and outer space, although cyber and outer space operations are key
enablers of actions in all domains including air, sea, and land. [One
indication of this is the US-EU negotiations surrounding a common
response to cyber threats which took place during the first US-EU Trade
and Technology Council (TTC) meeting in Pittsburgh in September
2021.]{.underline} In addition, during Trump's presidency, longstanding
US dissatisfaction with Europe's modest defense spending threatened to
put NATO on the backburner in transatlantic security debates.5 Since
then, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has elicited a sea change in German
defense policy with the announcement in February 2022 that defense
spending will increase to more than 2 percent of its gross domestic
output annually.6 While this may be a convincing signal that Europe will
finally devote the resources required for its own defense and revive
NATO's central role in transatlantic security, there is also a risk that
[China will be moved to the periphery of the alliance's
agenda.]{.underline}

Lately, however, [Europe has been waking up to a new
reality]{.underline}. From Obama to Trump to Biden, [US foreign policy
has been steadily looking for a way out of Europe]{.underline}. With the
Russo-Ukrainian conflict dating from 2014, Russia has been looking for a
way back in. Finally, [the EU has been talking for years about becoming
an autonomous security provider, which requires Germany to rise above
its self-absorbing pacifism]{.underline}. After a period of gradual
transformation, **[Russia's war on Ukraine is a tipping
point]{.underline}** that makes Lord Ismay's one-liner seem genuinely
outdated. When a threshold is reached, expect the system to change
rapidly. This is exactly what seems to be happening in Europe after
Putin invaded Ukraine. Judging from a common, united, and firm response
to the war, the Versailles Declaration, and the EU's Strategic Compass,
[both the EU and the national capitals are in tune with the historic
shifts in the post-war order in Europe.]{.underline} With the Americans
on their way out, and the Russians on their way in, [the EU will have to
imagine a new European security order.]{.underline} Two weeks into the
war, and after Russia became the most-sanctioned country in the world,
the French president invited the other 26 heads of EU states and
governments for a two-day informal summit in Versailles[. The EU leaders
adopted a strong declaration against Russian aggression and committed to
the broadest possible diplomatic, military, and humanitarian assistance
to Ukraine.]{.underline} [The Versailles declaration -- which was then
added to the Annals of the European Union -- talked about the common
responsibility to "protect EU citizens, values and democracies and the
European model".]{.underline} It also described the new fundamentals of
European security focusing on three key dimensions: "bolstering EU
defense capabilities, reducing energy dependencies, and building a more
robust economic base". 10 days later, the EU approved the strategic
compass, probably the most ambitious plan for a common foreign and
security policy in the history of European integration. On March 25, in
Brussels, the European Council endorsed it. Self-described as a "quantum
leap forward" [the compass aims to improve the EU's ability to "act
decisively" and turn the EU into "a stronger and more capable security
provider"]{.underline}. [The document is a roadmap for developing
military capabilities, improving defence spending and cooperation,
responding to information-based threats, and strengthening partnerships
with like-minded countries.]{.underline} The Versailles declaration and
the strategic compass have set the agenda for future EU action and
geopolitical orientation. However, they likely understate or disregard
even the long-lasting and possibly permanent effects of the changes that
the post-war order is undergoing.

[NATO is in its death throws with Russia and China looking on happily,
but **not that this military force was ever a real threat** to either
country.]{.underline}

[When you have]{.underline} Estonia and Lithuania and all the other
[former Eastern Bloc countries as powerless NATO members it isn't of
great concern to Moscow]{.underline}.

[As the US constricts from its former global dominant position, **it's
time for Europe to rethink the best way to face existential threats**
from an increasingly polarized world]{.underline}.

[The idea of establishing a unified European Army has been proposed time
and again, and the push for one, along with its validity is
clear]{.underline}.

It will happen.

The basis behind NATO was a noble one, and made sense, but there has
always been conflicting views about strategies, troop deployment and who
contributes to what.

[A heavy reliance on the US hasn't helped, and it's clear that with
**the organization's slow demise** running in parallel to Washington's
reserved stance to international relations, new friends and alliances
are needed.]{.underline}

[At the moment, Europe dances to Washington's]{.underline} tune. The
debacle of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan revived the debate about
the necessity for a European Army. [It is time for Europe to have
strategic autonomy over its decisions.]{.underline}

[A European Army can act as the crux on which Europe broadens its reach,
and establish military alliances in strategic locations across the
globe]{.underline}.

[Western defense for Europe can **no longer be confined to the North
Atlantic**]{.underline}, and the inclusion of the US should be as an
equal partner, and not based on an overreliance on them.

The number of NATO members that include so many Baltic nations suggests
the continuous fear of Russia, accompanied with a willingness to engage
in defensive collaborations. Proper execution of strategic defense can
only properly happen when it's in play with other global players.

Including India in an international military defense group would set the
cat amongst the pigeons. China would become increasingly nervous.

What about Japan as a member? The Pacific country is concerned with
China's growing presence on the high seas and its territorial claims
too. Strategically Japan can prove problematic for Russia too.

Egypt too is well positioned to become involved. The Suez Canal is a
vital trade route for the transport of Chinese goods.

All of these countries can contribute troops and military hardware,
along with intelligence gathering.

[Fostering military partnerships between Europe and specific Asian
nations offers the existing European NATO members with the opportunity
to have a seat at any table set up to address global
dilemmas.]{.underline}

It's been put forward that a European Army could number 50,000 troops to
defend its own borders, but by engaging with India and Egypt strong
bases in both the Far East, the Middle East and Africa are accessible.

Egypt will welcome any approach to join. It needs to diversify its
alliances with alternatives that run in parallel with its strategy to
position itself as a key powerhouse in both Africa and Arabia. An Egypt
holding a position of such stature is then of course appealing to
Europe.

With so many pluses for the presence of a European military force, there
are lots of obstacles yet to be overcome. There is French and Italian
enthusiasm, German consent, but other European countries appear
indifferent.

French President Emmanuel Macron endorsed the European Army idea in 2018
on the back of policies pursued under Donald Trump's administration that
barely took note of American's profound partnership with Europe.

[**The main hindrance to having a European Army in place is NATO
itself**. Monopolizing security issues in continental Europe throughout
the cold war era, NATO fell short in many campaigns, including the
Crimea, Libya, and most recently Afghanistan.]{.underline}

It is true that an effective EU foreign policy must always play a role
in a Western orchestra. A partnership with Washington is fair, but
obedience is something totally different.

A Europe capable of intervening anywhere in the world where its
interests are endangered, or indeed any of its global partners'
interests face problems, puts it on the front foot.

No permission needed from Washington. Following the Second World War
[Europe has been beholden to the US. This situation must change. It
will.]{.underline}

The submarine deal led by the US and UK with Australia reflect a policy
of indifference towards France and Europe.

The High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security
Policy Federica Mogherini has said that the group's security policy
should handle global pressures and local dynamics. Within this mix lies
the super-powers along with "increasingly fractured identities."

[Europe has no choice but to become a player in unfolding global
scenarios]{.underline}. Gone are the days of individual empires kidding
on they can influence the politics in former colonies. [It's now time
for a unified powerful and efficient military arm]{.underline}.

**[The European Army will fill the void left by a retreating
NATO]{.underline}**, but although it will play a crucial role, it is the
[global security]{.underline} and military partnerships it establishes
that will [position the EU as a global super power in its own
right.]{.underline}

The state of European defense is not strong.

The level of Europe's defense spending and the size of its collective
forces in uniform should make it a global power with one of the
strongest militaries in the world. But Europe does not act as one on
defense, even though it formed a political union almost 30 years ago.
Europe's military strength today is far weaker than the sum of its
parts. This is not just a European failure; it is also fundamentally a
failure of America's post-Cold War strategy toward Europe---a strategy
that remains virtually unchanged since the 1990s.

[Europe's dependence on the United States for its security means that
the United States possesses a de facto veto on the direction of European
defense. Since the 1990s, the United States has typically used its
effective veto power to block the defense ambitions of the European
Union. This has frequently resulted in an absurd situation where
Washington loudly insists that Europe do more on defense but then
strongly objects when Europe's political union---the European
Union---tries to answer the call.]{.underline} This policy approach has
been a grand strategic error---one that has weakened NATO militarily,
strained the trans-Atlantic alliance, and contributed to the relative
decline in Europe's global clout[. As a result, one of America's closest
partners and allies of first resort is not nearly as powerful as it
could be.]{.underline}

European militaries have now experienced decades of decline. Today, much
of Europe's military hardware is in a shocking state of disrepair. Too
many of Europe's forces aren't ready to fight. Its fighter jets and
helicopters aren't ready to fly; its ships and submarines aren't ready
to sail; and its vehicles and tanks aren't ready to roll. Europe lacks
the critical capabilities for modern warfare, including so-called
enabling capabilities---such as air-refueling to support fighter jets,
transport aircraft to move troops to the fight, and the high-end
reconnaissance and surveillance drones essential for modern combat.
European forces aren't ready to fight with the equipment they have, and
the equipment they have isn't good enough.

This is a European failure---but [Washington has played a
critical]{.underline}, if underappreciated, role [in precipitating this
failure. The American answer to European weakness has been to push NATO
member states to spend more on defense.]{.underline}1 As a result,
defense spending has become the defining issue of trans-Atlantic
relations in the 21st century. For more than two decades, both
Republican and Democratic administrations have vigorously pressed
European capitals to bolster their national forces in support of NATO.
No other topic has so consumed Washington's engagement with Europe than
the state of Europe's defense forces.

In the view of Washington, the only way to address Europe's defense
shortfall is for European nations to spend more. However, [this focus on
national defense spending levels---embodied by NATO members' 2014
commitment to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense---simply has not
worked. European defense today remains anemic despite noticeable
increases in spending.]{.underline}

In a departing speech to NATO allies in 2011, then-U.S. Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates lamented:

The non-U.S. NATO members collectively spend more than \$300 billion
U.S. dollars on defense annually which, if allocated wisely and
strategically, could buy a significant amount of usable military
capability. Instead, the results are significantly less than the sum of
the parts.2

Yet for Gates and U.S. policymakers, there was no other way than
European states spending more:

In the final analysis, there is no substitute for nations providing the
resources necessary to have the military capability the Alliance needs
when faced with a security challenge. Ultimately, nations must be
responsible for their fair share of the common defense.3

As this report argues, there is another way. **[There is no better
vehicle to integrate European defense than the EU]{.underline}**. Seven
decades ago, [Europe began a project that has integrated sector after
sector, forging a common market and an economic union. Then, after the
end of the Cold War, Europe took another transformative step, forming a
political union with the creation of the European Union. The EU set out
the goal of developing a common security and defense policy, but
progress has been slow. It is time for the EU to accelerate the process
of forming a defense union.]{.underline}

UPDATE OUR COLD WAR STRATEGY FOR TODAY'S GEOSTRATEGIC REALITIES

The premises and practices that underpin current U.S. strategy toward
Europe amount to a tweaking of those that prevailed during the Cold War,
never mind that the conditions in Europe are now wholly different.
[Europe has long since become an economic and technological
powerhouse]{.underline}, even a rival of the United States in global
markets. [No country with military power comparable to the Soviet Union
now threatens the European balance of power]{.underline} (Ukraine is not
critical to that balance). [The European Union, most of whose members
also belong to NATO, has a GDP that is more than nine times larger than
Russia's: €13 trillion versus €1.4 trillion. Europe is also
technologically far superior to Russia.10 Clearly, then, Europeans have
the material wherewithal to develop the capacity to deter
Russia.]{.underline}

PERILS OF PRIMACY: WEALTHY ALLIES CAN OUTSOURCE NATIONAL DEFENSE

[Now is the time for the United States to champion Europe's strategic
autonomy]{.underline}. Not only has it failed to do so, but it has also
steadfastly opposed the idea. Instead, [it complains intermittently
about the inequitable defense burden within NATO while allowing it to
persist]{.underline}.11 [Rather than harping on burden sharing, the
United States should move toward "burden shifting" that begins with
reductions in American forces and eventually leads to European
self-sufficiency in defense and the elimination of a permanent U.S.
military presence]{.underline}. That change need not involve the
jettisoning of NATO.

Because the United States has not demanded more of its European NATO
allies, their progress toward meeting the benchmarks adopted at the 2014
Wales Summit for national defense spending (2 percent of GDP) and
military procurement (20 percent of the military budget) has,
unsurprisingly, been spotty at best, something NATO's most recent
figures make clear.12 Moreover, Germany, Europe's wealthiest state, is
among the biggest laggards. Not only has Germany still not met the Wales
targets, but the Bundeswehr is also inadequately funded, understaffed,
and lacks all manner of equipment and spare parts.13 Had the Wales
benchmarks been met, European defense spending would have increased by
billions of dollars.

The curious upshot has been that an increasing preoccupation with the
Russian threat coexists with Europeans' failure to take the steps needed
to address it.

CODEPENDENCY AND THWARTING "STRATEGIC AUTONOMY"

Europeans have become accustomed to a regional security order that has
persisted for over seven decades and features a permanent U.S. military
presence and security guarantee.14 If one is a European, what's not to
like?

This arrangement goes beyond European dependency on the United States.
It resembles what psychologists call codependency, with a provider and a
recipient, each locked into their roles and unable to construct an
alternative. The dynamic persists because American leaders do not want a
change in the status quo. One of the enduring legacies of post-World War
II American primacy is the U.S. foreign and national security
community---the executive and legislative branches of government, the
media, academic specialists, and think tanks---remains convinced a
stable world order cannot exist unless the United States maintains, and
regularly displays, its preponderance, lest adversaries become
challengers and dominoes start to fall. The habitual invocation of
"credibility" owes to this mindset.15

A NEW, STRONGER SECURITY ORDER FOR EUROPE

BURDEN SHIFTING: EUROPEANS ARE WEALTHY AND CAN FIELD MODERN MILITARY
POWER

[Europe can defend itself and should do far more for its own defense
than it does now.16 In addition to spending more on their own defense,
European countries should develop an independent conception of security
that progressively moves their continent toward autonomy]{.underline}.
First, they should eradicate the problems that impair military
effectiveness. A case in point: the shortage of the most basic equipment
and essential parts for warships, warplanes, and submarines that plague
the Bundeswehr, the army of Europe's richest nation.17 [Next, Europe
should develop plans to harmonize defense production, especially by
coordinating defense spending and replacing duplicative weapons
production with a European-wide division of labor based on comparative
advantage]{.underline}. This will not be easy because of the pressure
leaders will inevitably face to keep production and jobs within their
countries and to support national defense industries. Still, there is a
difference between defense production based on national autarchy and a
collective approach. The latter would exploit opportunities for various
forms of collaboration, including coproducing armaments, divvying up
different parts of the production process, and exploiting comparative
advantages.

Whether and to what degree greater European strategic self-sufficiency
is worked out in cooperation with the United Kingdom should be a matter
for Europeans to decide. The same goes for whether strategic autonomy
coexists with a reformed NATO or eventually replaces the alliance. The
change should be implemented through close consultation between the
United States and its allies and at a pace that does not create needless
disruptions.

A NEW REGIONAL ORDER

[Because of the economic and military distribution of power in Europe,
Germany, the continent's wealthiest country, and France, its sole
full-service military power]{.underline} (the pair have a GDP 87 percent
greater than Russia's but combined spend more than \$60 billion less on
military expenditures based on Purchasing Power Parity, or PPP), [will
have to take responsibility for ushering Europe toward strategic
autonomy.18 It is desirable for them to work in tandem because of the
residual suspicions that linger about a Europe dominated by
Germany.]{.underline} Under French President Emmanuel Macron at least,
the French government has forcefully advocated for European strategic
autonomy (most recently during the 2021--2022 Ukraine-Russia crisis),
arguing Europe should have an independent voice and collective vision on
continental security.19

As part of a new strategy toward Europe, the United States should help
create a new regional order---one that integrates, rather than
estranges, Russia. Alienating Russia, as it has been for most of the
post-Cold War decades, has resulted in steadily increasing crises in
eastern Europe.

[The expansion of NATO]{.underline}---which has grown from 16 members at
its Cold War highpoint to 30 in 2022---[is]{.underline} but [one part of
the problem between Russia and the West]{.underline}, but it is [a big
one.]{.underline} Influential [Americans]{.underline} nevertheless
[insist Russia's concerns about the advance of a Cold War alliance
toward its borders are contrived and unrelated to security. They regard
the Russian president's objections as a ruse to mask his ("real") fear,
namely that democracy could spread to adjacent countries and eventually
threaten Russia's authoritarian political order]{.underline}.20 While
this may be true in part, a sound grand strategy must include an
awareness that other countries may not share American perceptions and
indeed may reject them wholesale.21

[What the United States sees as benign (NATO expansion or European
missile defense) Russia regards as threatening.]{.underline} A sound
strategy also requires the willingness and capacity to understand how
other countries perceive one's actions and the humility to resist the
urge to believe that you know what other countries' actual interests and
fears are. None of this means conceding what rivals want, let alone
appeasement; it does mean a willingness to understand the world as they
see it so that pathways can be found to advance U.S. interests and avoid
crises and war through reasonable compromise.22 As former Secretary of
State James A. Baker put it, "I would have to say that if there was one
key to whatever success I've enjoyed in negotiating...it has been an
ability to crawl into the other guy's shoes. If you understand your
opponent, you have a better chance of reaching a successful conclusion.
That means paying attention to how they view issues and appreciating the
political constraints they face."23

As it turns 70 this week, the Atlantic alliance has no shortage of
champions in Washington, even if it lacks one in the Oval Office. Yet,
the focus on NATO---the North Atlantic Treaty Organization---alone can
be misleading by magnifying the importance of the defense alliance in
the European project. In reality, the trans-Atlantic community has
relied on two pillars: a successful defensive alliance and an even more
successful project of European integration.

[Americans who are truly committed to the idea of a Europe "whole and
free" should realize that NATO is no longer the main spinal cord of the
European project; the European Union is]{.underline}. When George H. W.
Bush coined the phrase in 1989, [the level of intra-European integration
was arguably on par with the defense alliance as providing stability and
prosperity to the continent]{.underline}, and Americans were still
heavily involved in both. Remember, this was pre-Maastricht Treaty,
before the EU itself. Three decades of political, economic, and monetary
integration later---and 16 new members later---the European Union is
deeply entrenched in the lives of Europeans.

Today, [28 European democracies]{.underline}, which used to compete
among themselves and sometimes fight to their ultimate demise, [now
choose to pool sovereignty and have their interests communally discussed
and collectively defended]{.underline}. The EU is a power multiplier:
Every one of the 28 has a stronger individual voice because they stand
together in the European Union. Small European countries, whose
geography and demography would force them to cave to stronger neighbors,
can now count on the solidarity of the group---as illustrated by the
unwavering support for Ireland by the other 26 member states and the
Brussels institutions in the Brexit negotiations.

The neighbors of the European Union are no fools. Those who seek
prosperity and stability hope to join the EU club. Those who reject the
model set by the West and liberal democracies feel threatened by the
European Union---it is the prospect of Ukraine moving into the EU's
orbit through an Association Agreement that triggered Russia's hostility
and ultimate aggression, not NATO. [The power of attraction of the
European Union, at least as much as the security guarantees of NATO, has
helped stabilize Eastern Europe.]{.underline}

[Despite these realities, Americans often indulge in a scornful
disregard for the]{.underline} EU. Recently, benign contempt has taken
an ugly turn. Since taking office, President Trump and his
administration have attacked the European Union and individual member
states repeatedly, with near impunity.

At first sight, American complaints appear to be centered on the issue
of Europe's trading power, which rivals that of the United States. For
Donald Trump, the EU was created to "take advantage of" the United
States and it is "worse than China." Early in his mandate, the American
president pushed for tariffs on steel and aluminum and threatened to go
after automobiles, until a meeting with EU Commission President Juncker
put a brake on the downward spiral.

However, a deeper look reveals a fundamental ideological contention:
[The brand of nationalism and populism that defines this administration
stands in direct contradiction with the very existence of a liberal,
supra-national body such as the European Union.]{.underline}

As laid out by the State Department's Director of Policy Planning Kiron
Skinner in December 2018, the administration holds the view that
"international institutions have steadily encroached on the rights of
sovereign nations" and that "nothing can replace the nation-state as the
guarantor of democratic freedoms and national interests"---an indictment
of the EU's very existence. The ideological clash is reminiscent of
older times. Addressing a crowd in Warsaw in July 2017, President Trump
likened the European Union to the Soviet Union, criticizing a similar
"steady creep of government bureaucracy that drains the vitality and
wealth of the people," an equivalency popular in conservative circles.
Similarly, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested in a December 2018
speech in Brussels that EU bureaucrats were not really working for the
interests of European citizens.

By making no secret of his personal support for euroskeptic forces,
Donald Trump has become an active political opponent of the European
Union in its existing form. He celebrated the Brexit vote, expressed
support for far-right candidate Marine Le Pen ahead of the French
presidential elections, disparaged Angela Merkel repeatedly, and
appeared to rejoice at the Yellow Vests protest movement. He criticized
Theresa May for negotiating a "soft" Brexit, and even recommended to
Emmanuel Macron that France leave the EU. The American president has
nominated ambassadors famously critical of the EU, and his
administration demoted the EU ambassador's status without notification,
before reversing under criticism.

As Donald Trump torments both the Atlantic alliance and the European
Union, all rush to NATO's bedside, and few worry about the EU.
Truthfully, Atlanticists love to love NATO. It stands for values, valor,
unity, solidarity. NATO won the Cold War. Celebrating NATO is
celebrating the military. It is much harder to love the EU, the
bureaucracy, the politics, the regulations. The EU lacks democratic
appeal, and its slow-moving decisionmaking process create many
frustrations. Unlike in NATO, the United States sits on the sidelines,
it does not control who enters, or who stays in. The EU is also an
economic peer competitor, a tough trading partner, and a sovereign
international actor, at times non-compliant with American demands.

Yet, [the prospect of an implosion of the European Union should be as
unbearable and intolerable]{.underline} to an American audience as the
dissolution of NATO---or more so, as [no one wants to see the demons of
nationalism back on the European continent, along with a global economic
catastrophe]{.underline}. Benign neglect is counterproductive; but a
policy openly hostile to the European Union is a grave mistake. In a
world where the strongmen are striking back, Americans should not forget
that the European Union stands with the United States when it matters
most. The NATO summit in Washington this week should be the occasion to
recall not only the utmost importance of the Atlantic alliance to
trans-Atlantic security, but also the crucial contribution of the
European Union to peace, unity, and ultimately security for Europe and
beyond.

It is today sadly forgotten, that NATO was created not with one, but
with two objectives. [The second objective of NATO was to retain inner
peace, that is, keep the peace amongst NATO's own members. When NATO was
created, future peace between Germany and its neighbors was yet far from
secured,]{.underline} especially as seen from the perspective of
Germany's neighbors at the time, not least France. Thus, the saying of
NATO-creator Lord Ismay included that NATO should "keep the Soviet Union
out", but also "the Germans down", that is, to keep NATO members safe,
also from themselves. [NATO was never only about Russia]{.underline}.

Today [Germany is a great and constructive neighbor in
Europe]{.underline}. But [Europe sadly still sees other inner-neighbor
relations, which unfortunately cannot yet be considered absolutely
stable]{.underline}. One only needs to refer to the afterglows of [the
Yugoslav wars]{.underline}. From that perspective, it can be argued that
[all Balkan countries]{.underline} should be part of NATO --- not to
protect them against "Russia", or to strengthen NATO externally for that
matter, but simply to enhance the safe development of all the Balkan
countries concerning one another. [Bosnia-Herzegovina is especially
relevant]{.underline} here since the country is not even fully
stabilized internally yet. [There are also other less warm neighbor
issues, but still potential minority-heats, notably related to eastern
NATO members]{.underline}. NATO keeps all such inner-relations from
potentially flaring up, which may also be said to be in the interest of
Russia, and of Russia's partner in the Balkan area, Serbia. We should
note too, that [the EU also has a vital and overlapping interests to
co-work in this region.]{.underline}

The Caucasus is here another and very separate question. [**It is
difficult to see any possible NATO enlargement**]{.underline} in the
Caucasus [as stabilizing, perhaps somewhat on the contrary. And the EU
is also a more distant partner in the Caucasus. Turkey is, on the other
hand, a new and also interesting discussion]{.underline}. Some (perhaps
even a kind of "choir") have started to discuss, whether Turkey still
"fits" into NATO. On the other hand, to retain peace (again, not in
relations with Russia, but here Turkey-Greece and even Cyprus), there is
still an argument that peace can be best served with Turkey continuing
as partner in NATO (no matter which nationality of weapons Turkey should
wish to buy, actually).

[An important discussion can start to revolve around whether the USA
still belongs to NATO]{.underline}. Right-sizing is not enlarging; it is
a change of configuration. Such [a change in configuration is possible
in that the USA]{.underline} (and we already see increasing Atlantic
fractions) [could leave NATO, and let the Europeans]{.underline}
(including East-European states) [take full responsibility for their own
safety]{.underline} (including allowing all the Balkan countries into
such an EU-NATO arrangement).

[Letting the USA out of NATO would imply subsuming the European part of
NATO into the EU]{.underline}. Such a [possible development can have
many advantages for the countries concerned, as well as for
Russia.]{.underline}

First of all, [subsuming a "NATO-excluding-the-USA" into the EU would,
as mentioned, force the Europeans]{.underline} (including the eastern
ones) [to take full responsibility for their own security. This will
prevent "moral hazard" of political escalations in the hope that the USA
will "save" them or spend money on them for new US bases in their
location.]{.underline} An EU-NATO (without the USA) would have to find
new ways of working with the UK as well as with, of course, Russia.

Second, [there is sometimes a profound need for measures outside Europe,
where security and civilian efforts need to be thoroughly
coordinated]{.underline}. Using NATO "out-of-area" tends to be a recipe
for disaster today, and the NATO-bombing creating a collapse of Libya
was one such catastrophic example. [Complex civilian needs during
conflict basically cannot be taken care of by NATO, because NATO as an
organisation]{.underline} (though big enough in bureaucracy) [is simply
not designed for civilian efforts in connection with
conflict.]{.underline} NATO was created to deter an all-destructive war,
which would probably not have left much civilian life left to
"reconstruct" afterwards. The [cold-war scenario was]{.underline}
therefore [so totally different from the many extremely complicated
social-economical-etchnical-religious-resource-climate-poverty types of
civilian-military problems, which we see around in the world of
today]{.underline}. That is why [NATO interventions
automatically]{.underline}, because of the organization's outdated
design to focus so heavily on a now defunct "all-or-nothing" type of
armagedon-conflict [tends to create purely military, and hence quite
destructive, approaches]{.underline}. NATO is still so much designed as
a hammer, that sadly too many problems seem to be perceived as if they
had the shape of nails. As another example of the results of this, take
a look at Afghanistan, where most of NATO's "military-civilian"
approaches in reality tended to become too much "military-more-military"
approaches.

NATO is designed as a pure military organization, an by all means,
militaries are (still) designed only to destruct, not to construct.
[NATO simply does not have notable resources for civilian efforts to go
with its military efforts]{.underline}. In parallel to this, [we
regrettably also see in the USA a very unfortunate long-term general
tendency to militarize US foreign policy, sometimes at the expense of
resources and focus for civilian US foreign policy]{.underline}. Tools
should be designed for situations, not the other way around. But instead
of embarking on the long overdue redesign of the setting of NATO, a lot
of western politicians instead sadly try to redesign perceptions of
today's security-realities in Europe, trying to make the modern world's
security perception look more like the old "them-or-us" type, which
existed during the cold war. But there is a better road, which can be
taken[. The EU does have a constructive other tradition than NATO's
"all-out-war-preparedness" to build on, and the EU is still totally far
from the over-militarized development path, which the USA unfortunately
has taken]{.underline}. The [EU has developed a robust and broad
civilian-oriented conflict management capability. The EU already has
quite a range of experience with civilian "out-of-area"
missions]{.underline}. And [the EU is already developing in a direction
to integrate all these political management dimensions:]{.underline} The
civilian capabilities, and now increasingly upcoming, also an EU
military dimension.

We must remember, that military is politics with other means, and
[military should not be a destructive stand-alone option, but part of as
a series of differentiated political tools.]{.underline} Not just a
"hammer", but very varying shades and shapes of tools, within a fully
integrated political civil-military toolbox. It therefore can make
enormous sense to leave the NATO fully over as a new institutional part
of the EU. To enable the EU to manage the full range of all political
dimensions, in case a non-European conflict might benefit from European
assistance: military, civilian and economical.

Some caveats here include the potential issues this would involve
especially in relation to France, but a broader context to all the EU
countries. An EU-NATO without the USA will, of course, be centered on
France, a country with archaeological remains of imperial thinking and
ambitions, and its own possible "military-industrial-political" complex,
which might take on an arms race of its own. It is also to be avoided to
intervene just for the sake of it --- be it under "do-good" or imperial
intentions. Because once bureaucratic institutions have been erected for
any purpose whatsoever, their inner dynamic is that they urge their
surroundings to be made use of. These effects cannot be entirely
avoided, but might (hopefully) be mitigated by the full range of EU
member countries.

Therefore, [even taking account of the caveats]{.underline} just
mentioned above, [there is]{.underline} a possibility that [a lot of
positive things could potentially be achieved by letting the USA leave
NATO and allowing for the rest of NATO to be subsumed into the
EU.]{.underline}

[There are two commonplace objections to the idea of European strategic
autonomy. The first is that without the American defense guarantee
Europe will revert to disunity, even conflict. The other is that the
large number of European states will bedevil regional cooperation on
security. But instability in Europe, while a possibility, is but one

Europe]{.underline} (intra-E.U. exports approached \$300 billion in
2020, and for most members, exports within the European Union accounted

on the home front and the redistribution of power in the world.

CTF

In Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's class at Georgetown
University, she likened each element of U.S. power - development aid,
sanctions, bilateral diplomacy, multilateral diplomacy - to a tool in
the U.S. problem-solving toolbox. When faced with a challenge, the
United States can employ one or more of these tools. With the launch of
the Strategic Compass for Security and Defence, [the European Union is
adding a handful of new tools to its own toolbox, to better respond to
current and future challenges.]{.underline}

Promising a "quantum leap" in decisive security matters in the next
decade, [the EU is stepping into its role as a security provider and
global actor]{.underline}. The document is significant for the EU; it
can be seen as a parallel to the United States' National Security
Strategy in its scope.

A comprehensive creation process

[This is the first time in EU history that a threat analysis was
conducted with each member-state inputting its strategic
priorities.]{.underline} The Strategic Compass began in June 2020 as an
attempt to align EU defense and security goals between the 27
member-states. Therefore, [national priorities were translated into
European priorities through the diplomatic process. The major threats
the EU faces were identified as great power competition, potential
instability in its neighborhood, and transnational threats, including
cyber and hybrid attacks.]{.underline}

Staying relevant

Nevertheless, [the document realizes the fluidity of the geopolitical
environment and the shifting nature and magnitude of threats. Thus, the
Strategic Compass promises to be the first step in regular evaluations
of the evolving strategic environment, stipulating that a new threat
analysis will be conducted every three years, allowing changes to the
EU's strategy.]{.underline}

[The document's existence is proof that the EU is positioning itself to
better respond to strategic challenges.]{.underline} Russia's invasion
of Ukraine began right at the end of the Strategic Compass process.
Although the document acknowledges the crisis in its introduction, it
was clearly drafted before war returned to the European continent. As
such the document is not a reflection of the war. It is likely that the
next iteration of the threat analysis will more prominently feature
Russian tactics on display in Ukraine. Nevertheless, [many aspects of
the Strategic Compass will better prepare the EU for the tense
geopolitical environment brought about by the emerging great-power
competition.]{.underline}

New tools in the toolbox

The Strategic Compass contains a myriad of timelines and actionable
items. Among them is the goal that by 2025 an EU Rapid Deployment
Capacity of 5,000 troops will be ready.

The specificity and concrete timelines proposed in this document
demonstrate the resolve of the European Union to become a power broker
in the next decade. The schedule, while ambitious, is not impossible
provided the interest for greater European sovereignty continues among
EU member-states.

Further, [the Strategic Compass creates a new Hybrid Toolbox and
Response Teams, enhances the Cyber Diplomatic Toolbox and Cyber Defence
Policy, Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Toolbox, and
an EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence. The document notes that
hybrid threats are growing in scale and scope, specifically mentioning
that China and Russia have utilized hybrid tactics. The Hybrid Toolbox
will allow for a faster, coordinated attribution of
attack]{.underline}s. The Strategic Compass will further strengthen the
existing Cyber Diplomatic Toolbox, which has grown from a budget of €11
million in 2017 to almost double to €21.7 million in 2020. [Enhancing
the toolbox, solidifying the EU's Joint Cyber Unit, further developing
the EU's Cyber Defense Policy will be instrumental to deter cyber
attacks. The Strategic Compass outlines how information manipulation
threatens not only Ukraine but aspiring member-states; as a response, a
new toolbox being developed in coordination with the European Democracy
Action Plan]{.underline}. Many of the tools highlighted in the Strategic
Compass, such as the Cyber Diplomatic Policy and the EU Space Strategy,
have either been underutilized or underdeveloped, but the changing
nature of conflict, as is prominently on display in Ukraine, calls for
the EU to sharpen and enhance these tools.

Geographically, [the Strategic Compass references security on a global
level]{.underline}. However its emphasis is on the transatlantic
relationship and the regions neighboring the EU reflecting their special
importance to the bloc. Specifically, it calls for a strengthening of
NATO-EU cooperation both on the political and the military level. It
also calls for continuing the momentum created by the 2021 EU-US Summit
Statement, a political declaration of EU-US partnership across multiple
sectors. Further, regarding the EU's neighboring regions, focus is
placed on Africa, particularly the Sahel and West Africa, and the EU's
immediate east. Indeed Africa has repeatedly been identified as a region
of primary geostrategic importance for the EU as instability in the
continent crosses the Mediterranean; while Europe's east, from Moldova
to Georgia, is facing Russia's belligerency and destabilizing acts.

#### The EU has resources for cyber defense -- it solves the aff

[**The European Union will activate a team of cybersecurity experts** to
help Ukraine fight]{.underline} [off cyberattacks from
Russia]{.underline}, officials told POLITICO.

[The EU's Cyber Rapid Response Team includes around 10 national
cybersecurity officials of six European countries]{.underline} ---
Croatia, Estonia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland and Romania ---
[who can provide assistance to countries under cyberattack. The team
falls under the EU\'s defense cooperation program PESCO; it will be its
first deployment.]{.underline}

The six "participating member states made a decision to activate the
team," said Margiris Abukevičius, vice minister at the Ministry of
National Defence in Lithuania.

The move comes as Ukrainian cybersecurity services warned of incoming
cyberattacks and threats on Monday, amid the conflict with Russia in the
eastern part of the country.

Abukevičius said European officials will work out the details with
Ukraine on how many and which experts it will devote to the operation.
Sending the cyber team into Ukraine "is an option we're considering,"
Abukevičius said, adding it will depend on the type of support Ukraine
requests.

[The Ukrainian government on February 18 asked for the EU's support of
cyber military officials, in a letter to EU]{.underline}
[leaders]{.underline} seen by POLITICO.

[Kyiv]{.underline}'s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba [wrote to EU leaders
that it would \"welcome deployment to Kyiv\" of the team of experts to
evaluate \"vulnerabilities of our key computer networks and
systems.]{.underline}\" Kuleba [also requested \"additional technical
equipment and software for strengthening the cybersecurity
infrastructure]{.underline}\" from the EU.

[EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Monday evening told reporters
that the EU "will send a mission of experts to help Ukraine to face
cyberattacks]{.underline}," after meeting Kuleba at a meeting of
European foreign affairs ministers in Brussels.

Kyiv\'s plea for cyber reinforcements followed two major attacks on
Ukrainian government networks in recent weeks. In mid-January, hackers
posted messages on government websites and spread malware to wipe out
data. Government websites were also taken down by an avalanche of
traffic targeted at them last week, which Ukrainian security services
called the \"largest-ever\" attack of its kind in the country.

The country has faced a barrage of major cyberattacks in recent years,
many of which were attributed to Russian security services by Ukrainian
as well as Western officials. The country suffered attacks on its
elections in 2014 and on its energy grids in 2015 and 2016. The country
was also the epicenter of a global malware outbreak known as
\"NotPetya\" that quickly spread across the world, crippling
multinationals like the Danish shipping giant Maersk, logistics giant
FedEx, pharma company Merck and others.

Borrell already suggested [**the EU could offer cybersecurity
support**]{.underline} in mid-January, [saying the bloc would "mobilize
all \[its\] resources to help Ukraine to face these
cyberattacks."]{.underline}

[The bloc has poured millions into schemes supporting Ukraine's
cybersecurity and digital infrastructure in past years. The country is
seen as a front line in global cyber conflict and a testbed for
intelligence services to deploy cyber-offensive and espionage
tools.]{.underline}

CTF

What should the European Union do in the immediate term?

[The EU has adopted new frameworks, including its much vaunted Strategic
Compass, which, in the long term, **will improve cybersecurity in the
bloc**, and potentially reduce the risk of catastrophic Russian
cyberattacks]{.underline}. However, the EU needs to take more steps in
the short term to shore up cyber defenses and mitigate the threat of
Russian cyber operations.

First, [the EU should get its own house in order. The revised Network
and Information Security (NIS) Directive]{.underline}--better known in
Brussels circles as NIS 2--[should be finalized in the coming months and
will aim to further strengthen the security of supply chains, streamline
incident reporting obligations, and introduce more stringent supervisory
measures for a large number of operators of essential services and
enterprises across the EU.]{.underline} While NIS 2 represents a step in
the right direction, [the EU still has some way to go in implementing
harmonized cybersecurity rules across the bloc's own
institutions.]{.underline}

Second, [the EU and its Member States have a role to play in
discouraging and deterring cyberattacks by demonstrating a willingness
to act and impose costs on perpetrators]{.underline}. The first-ever
operational deployment of the EU's Cyber Rapid Response Team to Ukraine,
alongside similar teams from the United States, was a welcome signal in
this respect. [One way to impose further costs would be by pushing for
**coordinated attribution of cyberattacks at the
EU-level**]{.underline}. On the offensive and deterrent side, [the EU
should adopt a pooling of capabilities on a voluntary
basis]{.underline}. Similar programs already exist among other groups,
such as NATO's Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies
(SCEPVA) program, which the EU could use as a model for its own
programs.

Third, [**the EU should ensure it is better prepared by leveraging the
tools it already has** at its disposal. Intelligence sharing and
situational awareness have proven vital before and during the war in
Ukraine, but the future effectiveness of these strategies in deterring
and mitigating cyberattacks will be reliant on Member States willingness
to contribute with timely and actionable intelligence]{.underline}. In
the short term, the Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe),
a recently created group bringing together the executives of the EU's
twenty seven national cybersecurity authorities, should be used to its
full capability and integrated with the rest of the EU cyber ecosystem.
CyCLONe, with their wealth of operational-level expertise, should be
able to brief political decision-makers in the Council more frequently.
On the military side, the EU still lacks a fully fleshed-out cooperation
mechanism for military cybersecurity alerts, despite this being an
objective since the 2014 EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework. Ensuring
cooperation among both civilian and military groups is vital given the
specter of Russian cyberattacks.

[Supporting Ukraine is every democracy's duty. Russia will attempt to
undermine this support through cyberattacks and other means. The EU
needs to shore up its cyber defenses at home to ensure all Members can
continue to aid Ukraine in the future.]{.underline}

#### NATO hinders EU-Russia Cooperation

**Klijn 10** -- H.M. Klijn is a Senior Research Fellow within the
Security Unit of the Clingendael Institute. ("Europe's Virtual Security
Debate and a New Transatlantic Relationship," Jstor. July 10^th^, 2010.

The sudden demise of the Soviet bloc caught the world by surprise, so no
wonder at the time the alliance did not contemplate disbanding itself.
And given its continuation, it would have been politically impossible to
reject newly independent countries' wishes for accession. And yes, it
took NATO to intervene in the Yugoslav civil war, be it belatedly in
Bosnia and controversially in Kosovo. But it is obvious that the
original gist has been taken out of the alliance, and judging by the
arduous strategy debate it has not been replaced by a successor gist.
[In essence, NATO has been and is changing from a singleminded military
alliance into a multi-purpose platform enabling countries to cultivate
their bilateral ties with the US. That is why it will prove impossible
to erect a European pillar within NATO, as some commentators suggest
should be done]{.underline}. Why else would recently acceded member
states, apparently not trustful of NATO's consensus machinery in article
5 situations, be lobbying so actively with the US for additional
security guarantees? And would most allies send their units into
Afghanistan because they feel their national security is at stake in the
Hindu Kush or because they want to curry favour with Washington? When
last February the Dutch coalition government fell over the extension of
its Uruzgan mission, the first question raised was whether this implied
that the Netherlands would be kicked out of the economic G20 forum.

Of course, it makes sense for countries to ally themselves with the
world's foremost power, and only for that reason NATO will continue to
exist for some time to come. [But increasingly, the de facto EU-US-NATO
triangle is becoming untenable]{.underline}. On the one hand,
[sustaining US-led NATO as Europe's primary security forum at the end of
the day runs counter to EU ambitions in the field of foreign and
security policy]{.underline}; on the other hand it ties Europe to a more
global US security agenda that, deep down, it does not subscribe to and
that it is certainly not willing to shoulder financially. Finally, [as
long as Europe remains a function of US security policy, this will put a
curb on its ability to forge comprehensive partnerships with third
parties.]{.underline}

Revamping the transatlantic relationship

The transatlantic relationship, North America's partnership with Europe,
is still the world's most vital economic, strategic and political bond,
and will remain so for the foreseeable future. [The question is,
however, whether NATO should remain its ultimate embodiment, or whether
this relationship should be remodelled and based on a broad and new
strategic EU-US partnership]{.underline}, including provisions on
security and defence such as a mutual assistance clause. Such [a
recalibrated partnership would leave room for differences in approach
and be more informal in nature]{.underline}, while not necessarily
always involving all 27 EU members, but still important when crises
erupt. We have seen examples of this kind of cooperation on Iran, with
the EU3 teaming up with the US, and the Middle East, where the EU sits
next to the US, the UN and Russia in the Quartet: both cases that do not
allow for direct NATO involvement.

Good old NATO

Critics will maintain that we cannot do without NATO's unique
capabilities, in terms of joint planning and interoperability. No other
organization but NATO can conduct an operation like ISAF, the argument
runs. But in many respects ISAF is a revealing operation. What we really
see in Afghanistan is an able and willing coalition that runs the
demanding southern and eastern regional commands, and a host of other
countries doing something else in the more benign provinces. Out of
ISAF's 46 contributors, non-NATO member Australia seamlessly joins
combat operations in the South, while NATO member Germany is carrying
out its national stabilization operation in the North, steered by the
Bundestag rather than by NATO. And none of these countries would be able
to sustain their operations without US enablers. So it is rather the US,
and not necessarily NATO, which is pivotal within ISAF.

Trading NATO for the EU-US does not mean doing away with the acquis
atlantique, but it would mean doing away with a top-heavy alliance that
served its purpose well but increasingly stirs unease in Europe, while
becoming less relevant to Washington -- even if the newest US National
Security Strategy routinely speaks of NATO as the pre-eminent security
alliance in the world today. 4 [NATO, or Europe, is nowhere as central
in US security thinking as many Europeans like to believe. When 9/11
occurred, invoking the alliance's article 5 only came as an
afterthought]{.underline}. Paradoxically, this trend may be reinforced
under a less traditionally inclined President Obama, no matter how
enthusiastically his inauguration was celebrated in Europe. Moreover,
building a new relationship with the US which is more balanced than it
is now would likely stimulate Europe to further boost its post-World War
II integration process.

Third parties

Last but not least, [a new transatlantic partnership more firmly based
on both participants' autonomy would enable the EU, but also the US, to
review their relations with third parties.]{.underline} Take, for
example, Russia. [Among other reasons, the EU-Russia relationship,
important because of the density of trade, investment and energy links
but marred by endless negotiations on a new strategic agreement, is held
back because of Moscow's frustration that it cannot discuss security
with the EU, which tends to refer to NATO instead. As long as Europe
labels NATO as its primary security organization, **Moscow is likely to
regard the EU's neighbourhood policies as affiliated with the alliance's
enlargement agenda**, given the expressed synergies between these two
'EuroAtlantic organizations']{.underline}. More broadly speaking, the
outside world will look at Europe as a more serious interlocutor as it
depends less on US security guarantees. Sticking to the Russia example,
the US, lacking the economic dimension in its relationship with Moscow,
is perfectly capable of concluding deals on strategic issues, such as
the recent START agreement on nuclear arsenals. But many, not all, of
the bilateral irritants concern Europe and are NATO related. It is
probably no coincidence that Russian compliance with START has been made
dependent on missile defence developments in Europe.

NATO EXPANSION AND PERPETUAL CRISES IF EUROPE'S SECURITY ORDER EXCLUDES
RUSSIA

Not every dispute between Russia and Ukraine or Russia and Georgia can
be chalked up to NATO expansion.1 Yet the denial of any connection flies
in the face of the evidence. [Every post-Cold War Soviet and Russian
leader]{.underline} (Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin, and Vladimir
Putin) [has condemned NATO expansion]{.underline}. Moreover, Russia's
preoccupation with, and antipathy toward, that project reflects a
historical pattern: great powers seek spheres of influence and resist
adversaries' attempts to establish a military presence within them.2
That may not be commendable or desirable, but it does mean Russia's
behavior cannot reasonably be viewed as aberrant or indeed wholly
different from that of other great powers, including the United States.

Seen thus, the 2014--2015 and 2021--2022 crises centering on Ukraine
were not purely bilateral ones between Ukraine and Russia. [They
resulted, in part, from Washington's failure to seize the opportunity
afforded by the end of the Cold War---the "unipolar moment," when the
United States wielded unprecedented, peerless power---to forge a
pan-European security order that extended from the Atlantic to the
Urals]{.underline} (as the USSR's last leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, put
it) and included Russia. [The decision to expand NATO excluded Russia
from the new European order, whereas **a Europe-wide system would have
laid the foundation for far-reaching arms control and
confidence-building measures**, strengthening the security of a Europe,
newly conceived]{.underline}.3 Such measures as were taken to include
Russia were never so far reaching.4 Instead, the thinking about the
continent's future was timid and, worse, stuck in the past.

[American leaders may speak in general terms about the desirability of a
European order that integrates Russia, but such an arrangement would
diminish, and over time perhaps even destroy, U.S. primacy in
Europe.]{.underline} Russia is too large, powerful, and independent to
accept a European order in which the United States' preferences on
critical matters tend to prevail. [The desire to preserve the United
States' preeminent position within NATO may explain Washington's choice
not to include Russia]{.underline} in the alliance once it began to
expand after the Cold War.

Post-Cold War NATO expansion not only obligated the United States to
defend countries marginal to U.S. national security, but also
contributed to crises with Russia involving Georgia (2008) and Ukraine
(2014--2015, 2021--2022).

[Russia's alienation from a European order marked by U.S. primacy and
NATO enlargement also contributed to the demise of arguably the most
significant arms control agreement in modern European
history]{.underline}: the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
Treaty. [The INF Treaty eliminated all U.S. and Soviet ballistic and
cruise missiles with a range between 550 and 5,000 kilometers from
Europe]{.underline} (and, in Russia's case, Asia as well).5
Opportunities to build upon previous conventional (non-nuclear) arms
control treaties, such as the 1990 Conventional Arms Forces in Europe
Treaty, were also lost. Russia and the United States charged one another
with violating these agreements, but their differences should have been
resolved through negotiations, so that those accords could continue to
contribute to European security.

A new European security order should include regular diplomatic and
military-to-military exchanges with Russia. Discussions within these
forums could help prepare the groundwork for confidence-building
measures that reduce the risk of the frequent, close, and dangerous
encounters between the two countries' warships and military aircraft in
and around the Baltic Sea and Black Sea---something that has occurred on
several occasions---creating accidents that could spiral into a conflict
between the world's two nuclear superpowers.6

NATO continually underscores the magnitude of Russian power and the
threat it poses to Europe, but maintaining forces required to deter
Russia should not preclude steps toward a new European security system
in which it acquires a stake. Yet NATO remains divided on whether to
engage Russia. Even those members of the alliance who favor engagement
are not of one mind on what the agenda for engagement should be, the
extent to which engagement should be pursued, and the ends it should
seek.

Within NATO, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland are the least
enthusiastic about formulating a new approach toward Russia that would
have a distinctive European stamp.7 They are also the most fervent
opponents of strategic autonomy aimed at military self-sufficiency on
the continent, or even a reduced U.S. military presence.

The United States and Russia control approximately 90 percent of the
world's nuclear weapons, which makes avoiding direct conflict between
them paramount.

[The United States nevertheless has good reasons to change course in
Europe, among them China's rise, the relative decline in American
economic power, and festering social and economic problems at
home]{.underline}.8 And as the 2021--2022 [crisis with Russia
demonstrated, the American security guarantee to an enlarged NATO has
created more demanding defense commitments to its eastern flank now that
a stronger Russia has emerged]{.underline}. The consensus in Washington
is that [China presents the principal challenge to American primacy, and
Americans are increasingly concerned about problems on the home front.9
Under these circumstances, better to formulate a new approach to Europe
with care and deliberation than to change course abruptly because of
events in the Asia-Pacific.]{.underline}

#### A European army is k2 deter Russia

fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ("To Deter Russia, Europe

Now, six years later, the 414 Tank Battalion is finishing its deployment
in Lithuania, the first time in post-World War II history a permanently
integrated unit comprising two countries has deployed to a third
country. That's surely a good sign given that Macron and various [other
European leaders---past and present---have for years been advancing the
idea of some form of joint European military capability.]{.underline}

[If Russian leader Vladimir Putin backs down from the Ukrainian border
this time, European countries can thank their lucky star---Washington.
In their current setup, they are hardly able to deter Russia. That, of
course, is the reason Macron and others argue that **a "true European
army" is indispensable**]{.underline}.

But as de Jong and his troops---and indeed European politicians and
other officers---know, military integration isn't easy. Europe's best
efforts to date are otherwise the never-deployed EU Battlegroups and the
Eurocorps, which functions as the EU Battlegroup headquarters. The
Netherlands and Belgium form a joint navy, whose vessels patrol various
waters. That's no mean feat, but it's hardly as complicated as having
soldiers of two nationalities permanently serving alongside one another.

The integration hasn't been perfect. Indeed, for its first deployment
the 414 Tank Battalion had to borrow equipment from other Dutch and
German units, and the 1st Panzer Division is likely to need another
couple of years before it's fully combat-ready with its own equipment.
But when the 414th returns on its next rotation, it will be commanded by
a Dutch officer.

What's more, the two allies are in the process of integrating the Dutch
Army's two other combat brigades into Germany's Bundeswehr. The Dutch
11th Airmobile Brigade has already been made part of the Bundeswehr's
Rapid Forces Division; like the fully integrated 43rd Mechanized, it's
even listed on the Rapid Forces' list of units.

Pending approval by the new governments in Berlin and The Hague, the
Dutch Army's 13th Light Brigade will also be integrated into the
Bundeswehr: an army's whole combat capability, integrated into another
country's army. Logistically, it's a staggering achievement---and
politically, too, considering that a mere 82 years ago the Netherlands
was occupied by Nazi Germany.

At the moment, the two armies are even writing a joint Common Army
Vision. "The German and Dutch armies are constantly in contact with each
other to discuss further cooperation, which they do through a formal
entity called Army Steering Group," a spokesman for the German Army told
me.

Such integration requires enormous trust. "The Dutch-German integration
is quite unique; it is nearly without caveats and works very well,"
noted Bart Groothuis, a Dutch defense expert and member of the European
Parliament for the Dutch center-right People's Party for Freedom and
Democracy. "But if there were to be a crisis in the Baltics, would we,
for example, have the logistics to resupply it? The answer is no. So why
are we then so happy about it?"

To be sure, the 1st Panzer Division won't be supplanting U.S. forces in
Europe anytime soon: U.S. European Command has more than 60,000 military
and civilian personnel, not to mention superb equipment stored in
various European countries. And when crises loom, Washington can send
more. On Feb. 6, 1,700 members of the 82nd Airborne Division deployed to
Poland from Fort Bragg.

To have reached the 1st Panzer Division's level of integration is,
however, a remarkable achievement for any two countries. Building trust
(not to mention overcoming language barriers) are just one part of the
challenge. "There also has to be the military and political will to make
it happen," de Jong noted. "If politicians are only interested in a
picture in a newspaper, the whole thing will fall apart."

Of course, the whole thing will equally fall apart of the countries
disagree on when it should be used. If Germany had wanted to send the
414 Tank Battalion to Lithuania and the Netherlands had refused, it
would have been useless. The unit's deployment, NATO spokeswoman Oana
Lungescu told me, "is a strong display of Germany's and the Netherlands'
commitment and capabilities. At a time of unprecedented security
challenges, the ability of allies to act together quickly and
effectively remains essential."

[Thanks to the Bundeswehr,]{.underline} [the Dutch Army has maximized
its striking and rapid-forces capabilities at minimal
expense]{.underline}. The Bundeswehr has, of course, gained new soldiers
and officers. And [both sides share equipment that would otherwise have
to be duplicated]{.underline}. Indeed, [interoperability and cultural
hurdles notwithstanding, integrating one's armed forces with those of a
neighbor seems commonsense. With such integration, Europe's various
armed forces could turn into a mighty force, one capable of looking
after the continent and any deserving neighbors.]{.underline}

[Imagine what fully integrated European armed forces would be able to do
now that Russia is flexing its]{.underline} muscles. Finland and Sweden
are, in fact, working hard to combine, for example, defense planning and
use of airfields. But [integration has the most potential if it involves
a larger and a smaller country]{.underline}. Germany is, in fact,
working to replicate the 1st Panzer Division success. And perhaps

#### NATO deterrence fails -- Baltics prove NATO isn't key to stop hybrid war

The increased Russian foreign policy assertiveness and the related
security concerns associated with the Eastern Flank of
[NATO]{.underline} caused a revival of interest in European deterrence
after more than two decades of neglect. Yet the absence of a military
invasion into the Baltics does not necessarily imply a successful
deterrent threat. Quite the contrary: a detailed analysis using Boolean
logic suggests that **[deterrence does not really work in the Baltics,
neither at the conventional, nor at the sub-conventional
level.]{.underline}** [A lack of capabilities undermines the credibility
of NATO's conventional deterrence posture despite its clear effort to
communicate the threat to the other side]{.underline}. The only reason
why the lack of capabilities on the Eastern Flank has no negative
consequences for the Alliance is because Russia has (currently) no need
to advance its state interests by resorting to military force. At the
same time, [deterrence fails repeatedly at the subconventional level and
it will probably continue to fail in the future.]{.underline} Incidents
like the relocation of the Bronze Soldier Memorial in 2007, the
kidnapping of a security officer in 2014 or the violations of airspace
in 2018 can escalate to a full-blown crisis. Limiting the number of such
incidents should be the main goal of the cumulative deterrence of hybrid
threats.

[An assertion that a deterrent threat prevented a military attack is
probably the closest thing one can have in strategic studies to the
article of faith.]{.underline} One might easily claim, and many in fact
do, that an absence of evidence documenting the existence of God is not
necessarily evidence of its absence. Some of us thus keep believing in
God despite the lack of evidence[. And it is similar for deterrence: it
is notoriously difficult to prove its success, because the absence of an
aggressive action might be caused by other factors than the deterrent
threat itself.]{.underline} In other words, **[the absence of an attack
is not necessarily evidence of a successful deterrence.]{.underline}**
Most of the scholars recognise that (see Buzan 1987, pp. 163--164,
Morgan 2003, pp. 117--129, Paul 2009, p. 3, Rid 2012, pp. 142--143,
Freedman 2013, p. 159) and still, we rarely question this article of
faith. But one does not have to wait for the invasion to occur in order
to investigate the existence of deterrence, and this text aims to do
exactly that. It tries to examine the security environment at NATO's
Eastern Flank at both the conventional and the sub-conventional level in
order to find out if deterrence works in the Baltics.

The European security is experiencing profound changes resulting from
the increased Russian foreign policy assertiveness that Vladimir Putin
voiced for the first time in his speech at the Munich Security
Conference in 2007. It also does not take much effort to recognise a
remarkable shift in the attention that NATO paid to deterrence in
consequence of the annexation of Crimea in March 2014. Deterrence was
entirely absent from the 2008 Bucharest Summit official declaration
(NATO 2008), and merely two paragraphs were devoted to it in the most
recent Strategic Concept (NATO 2010). The final communiqu  from the
Wales Summit of the Alliance (NATO 2014) still mentioned deterrence less
than a dozen times, but the count trebled already at the Warsaw Summit
(NATO 2016). Bearing this in mind, the history of the Alliance can thus
be divided into three distinct periods. During the first one, the
Alliance devoted most of its attention to collective defence and
deterrence, while staying open to detente especially after the Harmel
Report. Later, after the end of the Cold War, it found a new purpose in
out of area operations and crisis management. The last period, which
began with Crimea, is characterised instead by a mix of priorities from
the previous two periods and a careful rebalancing from crisis
management towards a more traditional collective defence and deterrence
again. The Baltic region is the best example of this gradual shift back
to the basics and thus it became the focus of a case study presented
here as well.

[Yet this renewed emphasis on deterrence seems incomplete beyond the
often repeated rhetorical exercises]{.underline}. It takes sufficient
capabilities, solid credibility, and strong communication of threat to
make deterrence work, but a closer look at the Baltic region reveals
that [there is not much of a substance behind NATO's declaratory
statements.]{.underline} The deterrent message of serious consequences
in line with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty in the case of an
aggressive action against any NATO member state is expressed clearly
enough (Rasmussen 2014, Mattis 2017, Pompeo 2018). However, after
disregarding mutual deterrence at the nuclear level, the [continuous
Allied communication of deterrent threats lacks sufficient conventional
capabilities on the Eastern Flank to be credible.]{.underline} Luckily
for NATO, the analysis presented here shows that this lack of
credibility does not really matter at the moment. Instead of a blind
belief in the success of conventional deterrence, which is supposedly
illustrated by the absence of a crisis leading to a Russian invasion
into the Baltics, the lack of the Allies' conventional capabilities to
back up their own deterrent messaging suggests a need to shift the
attention elsewhere. Boolean logic makes it possible to disentangle the
argument and to show that the absence of a serious military crisis in
the Baltics is not due to the success of deterrence at the conventional
level, but rather due to the current lack of Russian interest in
repeating the Crimean scenario in Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania. This
conclusion is the only available explanation of the situation on the
Eastern Flank of NATO after analysing the communication, credibility and
capabilities of the Alliance and its member states.

[Deterrence does not work at the conventional level]{.underline}, but it
still did not fail thanks to the missing interest of the other side.
**[Yet at the sub-conventional level of hybrid warfare, where deterrence
matters most today, it failed repeatedly]{.underline}**. **[Russia
currently does not seem to be deterred by NATO or its individual members
at the sub-conventional level, where hybrid threats naturally
belong.]{.underline}** Moscow regularly conducts actions which would
normally amount to deterrence failure and there are no signs on its part
of any intention to change this practice. To put it simply, the
insufficient conventional capabilities of NATO on the Eastern Flank
(Luik and Jermalavičius 2017, Cornish 2017, p. 9) do not have negative
consequences only thanks to the lack of Russian interest in challenging
the status quo in the Baltics in the first place. Moreover, where it
matters the most, [deterrence does not work simply because the number of
attacks below the conventional level prove it completely
ineffective.]{.underline} However, the most important result of these
findings with respect to practical policy and scholarly analysis is that
the Alliance has a vital interest in making subconventional deterrence
work. That is due to the fact that a possible escalation of a local
hybrid crisis might unmask the lack of conventional capabilities in the
Baltics and by that also put the overall deterrence posture of NATO into
question. The following text offers a similar structure of the argument.
After analysing the logic of deterrence at the beginning, it continues
by focusing on the conventional level and on shifts in communication in
the second part the article. The third part of the text is then devoted
to deterrence at the sub-conventional level of hybrid warfare and to
some examples of repeated failures of deterrence at this level. The
conclusion then not only summarises the whole argument, but also gives
specific recommendation on how to adapt the logic of deterrence to the
European security environment after Crimea and to hybrid warfare.

#### NATO cooperation fails to deter hybrid war -- empirics 

**Halas 2019** (Matus Halas works as a Senior Researcher at IIR and
member of the Centre for European Politics. He studied international
relations at the Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in
Prague (Ph.D.) and political science at the Faculty of Arts of Comenius
University in Bratislava (Mgr.). In the past, he worked as a lecturer at
the Baltic Defense College in Estonia (2016-2018), editor of the
scientific section of the SME journal (2015) and assistant professor at
the Institute of European Studies and International Relations in

)//MargaretE](https://doi.org/10.1080/09662839.2019.1637855%20)//MargaretE)

Yet [one doesn't have to look for a long time in order to find a proof
of deterrence failure at the sub-conventional level already happening on
a regular basis]{.underline} and in line with the third row of Table 1,
which depicts the logic of deterrence by using Boolean algebra[. The
Estonian island Vaindloo in the Gulf of Finland witnessed at least half
a dozen violations of its airspace by Russian state-owned aircraft in
2018]{.underline}. Since Estonia has virtually no air force or
ground-based air defence systems and relies entirely on the NATO Baltic
Air Policing as regards the protection of its airspace, in this case one
can hardly expect a use of kinetic force similar to the shooting down of
the Russian Su-24 in November 2015 after a very similar incursion into
the Turkish airspace. [These violations easily stay below the Article 5
threshold]{.underline} in the given context with no risk of conventional
escalation under present conditions. [But they represent a constant
reminder of the limited ability of the three Baltic states to protect
their sovereignty]{.underline}. How Estonian military personnel will
react to these airspace violations after Estonia procures a medium-range
air defence system and how the allies will react if Estonia for whatever
reason decides to shoot down the aircraft, remains to be seen.

Another example of the lacking sub-conventional deterrence and
intentional pushing and probing below Article 5 is the already mentioned
visit of the U.S. President Obama in Tallinn in September 2014 and the
events that occurred immediately after his visit. [In a rather symbolic
move, just two days after Barack Obama declared that "the defense of
Tallinn and Riga and Vilnius is just as important as the defense of
Berlin and Paris and London", Russian FSB agents kidnapped the Estonian
Internal Security Service officer]{.underline} Eston Kohver and took him
across the border into the Russian Federation, where he was sentenced to
15 years in prison. The abduction helped to cement the reputation of the
FSB as "the most aggressive Russian special service targeting Estonia"
(EISS 2016, p. 14), although Kohver was then swiftly exchanged in a Cold
War-like swap for a Russian spy on a bridge over the border river Piusa
shortly before a meeting between Putin and Obama[. The border between
Estonia and Russia remains an unresolved issue in general.]{.underline}
Just about a decade ago and thanks to the territorial changes after
WWII, a small part of Estonia could have been reached only by taking a
short section of a road through the Russian territory. Although an
alternative detour has been built in recent years, the final resolution
of the problem by an exchange of territory as proposed in the
Estonian-Russian State Border Treaty signed in 2014 is not going to
materialise due to the Russian refusal to ratify the treaty.

[Maybe the best example of how a full-blown crisis resulting from
deterrence failure at the sub-conventional level might look was the
riots and cyber attacks following the relocation of a Soviet-era bronze
soldier from a square in central Tallinn to a military cemetery in
2007.]{.underline} While the emotionally charged issue of relocating a
WWII monument led to two days of rioting, several burned cars and looted
shops, dozens of wounded individuals and hundreds of arrests, the
subsequent three weeks of distributed denial-of-service cyber attacks
from abroad brought Estonia -- a digital champion of the world that just
introduced electronic voting in parliamentary elections -- virtually to
its knees. [It was not just websites and mail servers of government
agencies and political parties that were shut down by an incoming
traffic that exceeded the normal level by degrees of magnitude. Online
services of major newspapers were disrupted too, as were the electronic
operations of the biggest Estonian banks]{.underline} (Joubert 2012).
National authorities managed to cope with this onslaught only by
digitally cutting Estonia off from the rest of the world and thanks to
the lucky coincidence that a few key individuals of global internet
security were present in Tallinn at the same time. [All of that happened
long before NATO started to pay attention to hybrid threats in relation
to Article 5 scenarios.]{.underline} The reported disruption of mobile
phone networks in some NATO member states during the recent Zapad
exercise (Cook 2017) then only shows that the Russian military practices
exploitation of electronic and digital vulnerabilities on a continuous
basis.

Crises and incidents like that have a significant escalation potential,
which is not only the reason for the certain degree of ambiguity on the
NATO side that was mentioned earlier, but also the source of a major
concern. [**Hybrid threats must be dealt with primarily by individual
member states**]{.underline} and therefore NATO should not be, strictly
speaking, blamed for deterrence failure at the sub-conventional level.
Yet due to the possibility of Article 5 activation and a hybrid crisis
escalation to the conventional level, NATO might be very much involved
in a resolution of the crisis. A challenge to the status quo and a
related threat to use military force in order to promote state interests
-- for example, in the form of protection of ethnic minorities -- might
then unmask the weak points of a strategy, which the Allied deterrence
posture in the region rests upon. "As a tripwire force largely taken out
of NATO's Cold War playbook, the eFP is not automatically suited to the
subconventional and conventional challenges" in the Baltics (Zapfe 2017,
p. 157) and reinforcements with follow-on forces might not be in place
with a sufficient strength soon enough. The Alliance thus has a clear
interest in making sure that deterrence of hybrid threats will work as
much as possible in the future. The whole situation also illustrates how
conventional and sub-conventional levels of deterrence relate to each
other in the post-Crimea security environment in Europe, similarly to
how the division of Germanymade superpowers realise the linkages between
nuclear and conventional deterrence during the Cold War.

#### Deterrence fails -- countless empirics 

**Ruhle 2015** (Michael Rühle is currently Head of the Hybrid Challenges
and Energy Security Section, in the Emerging Security Challenges
Division in NATO's International Staff, "Deterrence: What it can (and
cannot) do"
<https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2015/04/20/deterrence-what-it-can-and-cannot-do/index.html>
)//MargaretE

If only it were so easy. [History abounds with examples of deterrence
failing despite a balance of forces, and even cases in which the weaker
side attacked the stronger.]{.underline} In some cases, the weaker side
banked on the element of surprise[. The military leadership of Imperial
Japan, for example, was fully aware of US military superiority. But if a
surprise attack on the Pearl Harbor naval base would destroy a major
part of the US Pacific Fleet while paralysing Washington politically,
Japan might stand a chance of prevailing.]{.underline} In 1973 [Syria
and Egypt attacked the militarily superior Israel]{.underline} -- not
because they hoped to win, but because they wanted to re-establish the
political clout they had lost after Israel had defeated them in the 1967
Six-Day-War. [Israel had not seen the attack coming: why would two
militarily inferior countries even think of attacking an opponent that
was certain to emerge victorious? This self-assuredness led Israel to
ignore the many warning signals about a pending attack]{.underline}. As
a result, the rapidly advancing armies of Egypt and Syria were initially
much more successful than expected. [Military superiority had not
ensured deterrence.]{.underline}

[Another important example for the pitfalls of deterrence is provided by
the 1982 Falklands War.]{.underline} Argentina, which contests the
United Kingdom's authority over the islands in the South Atlantic, knew
only too well about the superiority of the British armed forces.
However, over the course of several decades the UK had gradually been
reducing its military protection for the islands. Thus, while London
kept emphasising that the Falklands were British, the military Junta in
Buenos Aires became convinced that such statements were mere lip
service. When the Junta faced a domestic crisis that threatened its
rule, it tried to generate support by stirring patriotic feelings and
occupied the islands. [Deterrence had failed because the United Kingdom
had ignored an important factor. Striking a tough pose while at the same
time reducing the means to make good on it undermines one of
deterrence's most important ingredients: credibility.]{.underline} The
story did not end there, however. Much to Argentina's surprise, the
British Navy sailed to the South Atlantic and re-conquered the islands.
General Galtieri, the Chief of Argentina's military Junta, later
admitted that he never believed that a European country would be ready
to pay such a high price for a few insignificant islands so far away.
Argentina, too, had miscalculated.

But could Galtieri and his fellow countrymen not have guessed that a
proud nation like the United Kingdom would not stand idly by as part of
her overseas territory was being occupied by another power? Should one
not have known that remaining passive would have spelled the end for any
British government? The answer: yes, in normal times Argentina may well
have pondered such scenarios. However, in a crisis humans tend to think
along a different kind of logic. [Indeed, many studies about human
behaviour demonstrate that people who fear to lose something valuable
are ready to take greater risks than those who hope to make a gain. In
the context of the Falklands War, this means that for the Junta, which
was under siege politically, occupying the "Malvinas" was not about a
gain, but rather about avoiding losing power]{.underline}. This made
them take risks they otherwise would not have dared to take. Rationality
-- a precondition for a stable deterrence system -- had evaporated.

[Looking at Russian domestic politics today, the lessons of 1982 are
worth reconsidering: stirring nationalism in order to generate political
support may lead one to military adventurism which can be
self-defeating.]{.underline}

All these cases demonstrate that [deterrence is not just about military
balances, but also about interests. If the opponent's interest in
achieving a certain objective is higher than one's own, deterrence may
fail.]{.underline} A classic example is the Cuban missile crisis of
1962. When it became clear that Washington was ready to defend its core
security interests, the Soviet Union withdrew the missiles it had
started to deploy in Cuba. Another example is the Vietnam War. Although
the United States was militarily far superior, it ultimately had to
withdraw because the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong were willing to
make much greater sacrifices to achieve their goals than the US was
willing to make in support of South Vietnam. [This asymmetric set of
interests not only makes deterrence fail, it also makes big powers lose
small wars.]{.underline}

Aside, What's the U.S. Role in NATO?" New York Times, March 10^th^,

[President Trump has many bad ideas. Reconsidering America's role in
NATO isn't one of them.]{.underline}

NATO, a military alliance, was formed specifically to prevent the Soviet
Union from dominating Europe, whose principal powers --- Germany,
France, Italy and Britain --- had been so devastated by World War II
that they were vulnerable to Soviet coercion, subversion or conquest.
[NATO also became a vehicle for rehabilitating the Axis powers ---
Germany and Italy --- under the victors' tutelage.]{.underline}

[America had an enduring interest in ensuring that the Continent not
fall under the domination of a single, capable, hostile power: That
could pose a serious threat to America]{.underline}. The Truman
administration was clear on this point: [The main purpose of stationing
American military forces in Europe in the early 1950s was to stay long
enough to right the balance of power, not to stay forever.]{.underline}

[By the 1960s, the balance was restored. Western Europe's economies were
booming; Britain and France had become nuclear powers; German militarism
had been tamed, even as a new, large modern army emerged in West
Germany.]{.underline} [During the Vietnam War, America was so free of
worry about the Soviet threat that it essentially milked its
conventional forces in Europe to support its war in
Indochina]{.underline}. Its European allies contributed nothing to
America's effort in Vietnam. By 1968, with the collapse of
Czechoslovakia's government and army, the Soviet-controlled Warsaw Pact
alliance also appeared less capable.

[In the early 1970s]{.underline}, Senator Mike [Mansfield]{.underline},
a Montana Democrat, [led an effort to cut the American troop presence in
Europe.]{.underline} [It]{.underline} lost momentum in part because the
Soviet Union conducted an ill-fated military buildup, which contributed
to its economic failures in the 1980s. Senator Mansfield's campaign
[was]{.underline} also [opposed by the Europeans, who preferred to keep
their American security blanket, and by President Richard Nixon and his
chief foreign affairs adviser, Henry Kissinger, who rejected what he
considered congressional meddling in foreign policy. Oddly, troop
reductions in Europe would have been consistent with the "Nixon
Doctrine," which called explicitly for allies to do much more in their
own defense.]{.underline}

[The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 removed the last vestiges of a
major security threat to NATO]{.underline}, and with it, the rationale
for the American military presence in Europe. Russia's annexation of
Crimea and its violent machinations in Eastern Ukraine haven't improved
its ability to threaten NATO. Instead they have placed Mr. Putin in the
penalty box. The European Union, like America, reacted appropriately by
imposing punishing sanctions on Russia.

[The whole misadventure has diminished Russian power. Europeans are able
to defend themselves. **France and Germany together equal Russia's
population, enormously outweigh the country economically and outspend it
militarily**.]{.underline}

But [organizations don't like going out of business]{.underline}, and
NATO was a "good brand," making it useful for other projects. So [NATO
took on a new goal: banishing security competition from all of Europe
and its periphery, and bringing liberal democracy to former subjects of
the Soviet empire]{.underline}. Instead of being re-evaluated, [NATO got
bigger.]{.underline}

[NATO's expansion now requires the United States to defend all the new
member states from both conventional and nuclear threats --- a tall
order given their proximity to Russia and a strategically unnecessary
project since they can contribute nothing to American national
security]{.underline}.2

From an organization that could succeed simply by deterring a major
military threat, [NATO turned into an expansive project to make all of
Western Eurasia safe, liberal and democratic --- goals that are much
more complicated]{.underline}.

[NATO's **wars in Bosnia, Kosovo and Libya all depended on significant
American military capability**; none produced functioning liberal
democracies.]{.underline} [Among three of post-Cold War NATO's new
members --- Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria --- democracy is now suffering
erosion or is in actual retreat.]{.underline} [NATO's 2008 Bucharest
summit declaration that Ukraine and Georgia "will become members of
NATO" proved alarming to Russia --- and helped pave the way to wars. In
other words, NATO's well-intended political project is an expensive
failure.]{.underline}

Ironically, [NATO also encourages fecklessness among its
members]{.underline} in ways that can be likened to what financiers call
the "moral hazard" phenomenon, in which excessive insurance, offered for
an ostensibly good purpose, promotes risky behavior by those insured.

[America's wealthy European allies have underfunded their own
militaries, secure in the credibility of America's
commitment]{.underline}. Even the most martial [European
powers]{.underline}, France and Britain, [don't spend enough today to
pay for their much-reduced post-Cold War force structures. They barely
reach the alliance's obligation]{.underline} to spend 2 percent of
G.D.P. on defense. France and Germany spend roughly half, and Britain
two-thirds, of what the United States does per soldier; unless they have
achieved remarkable levels of efficiency, they must be cutting corners.

Germany today spends only about 1.25 percent of G.D.P. on defense,
leaving the German armed forces a sad remnant of their very capable Cold
War incarnation. Until 1990, that army could put a dozen heavily armed
divisions into the field a few days after mobilization. Today it would
be lucky to get one fully equipped division into the field. Less than
half of German military equipment is ready for combat.

While European and American politicians and pundits wring their hands
about the Russian military threat, European governments and militaries
practice business as usual. The [dysfunctional turn in European domestic
politics seems to be enabled by elites who fear no foreign threats
because the United States dutifully promises to take care of
them.]{.underline}

Finally, NATO helps make American military action abroad too easy. [The
existing base structure in Europe may facilitate intervention in the
greater Middle East --- but the greater Middle East is another part of
the world where the United States should be doing less
militarily]{.underline}. When Washington politicians consider military
action there, it would be better if they had to negotiate rather than
assume access to European bases. It would force policymakers to take a
bit more time to think.

Supporters of proposed interventions know that the American public likes
the idea of having allies. NATO support helps sell an operation to
voters. Europeans can applaud our action, enable our deployment to the
theater and contribute small military forces to provide the patina of
cost and risk sharing. [The Allies did contribute troops --- and
suffered significant casualties --- in the extended Afghan
counterinsurgency, but the wars NATO enables are the Americans' to win
or lose.]{.underline}

NATO's founding mission has been achieved and replaced with unsuccessful
misadventures. The United States has urgent business at home, and
arguably in Asia. Though President Trump has no strategy for returning
the European allies to full responsibility for their own futures, the
American foreign policy establishment could better spend its time
devising such a strategy than defending the counterproductive
trans-Atlantic status quo.

A reappraisal is long overdue.

#### Perm fails \-- treaty withdrawal halts cooperation 

**Schmidt 2021** (Averall Schmidt researches the politics of
international law, focusing on the consequences of states\' decisions to
violate, contest, or withdraw from treaties for the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, "Breach of Trust: How Treaty
Withdrawal

Shapes Cooperation Among States", July 21 2021,
<https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/meyau/> )//MargaretE

What explains persistent cooperation in the face of withdrawal by some
states, but not others? More broadly, how does treaty withdrawal affect
the prospects of international cooperation? I argue that the
consequences of withdrawal on international cooperation are best
explained by viewing exit as a breach of norm-based trust. [When states
exit treaties they violate the norm that agreements must be
kept]{.underline} (pacta sunt servanda), [**undermining** the foundation
of trust upon which **cooperation** is based]{.underline}.
[States]{.underline} perceive exit as a violation of international norms
and, consequentially, [react with indignation]{.underline}. [This sense
of being wronged drives states to punish the norm-violating state by
isolating it internationally and **avoiding cooperation with it in the
future.**]{.underline} As a result, [state parties to the treaty of
withdrawal]{.underline} -- those whose trust has been violated -- [begin
to opt out of ratifying agreements to which the withdrawing state is a
member.]{.underline}

The implications of this argument differ from other common explanations.
One possibility is that [withdrawal causes states to develop reputations
for unreliability, making it more difficult for them to attract
cooperative partners in the future.]{.underline}5 A second explanation
is that [the consequence of withdrawal on cooperation are a function of
the material cost that it exacts on other state]{.underline}s: states
respond more harshly to withdrawals in issue areas characterized by
direct costs as compared to those where the costs of withdrawal are more
diffuse or modest.6 A final possibility is that withdrawal has no
independent effect on cooperation; instead, both withdrawal and observed
changes in cooperation are the byproduct of increased isolationism,
populist nationalism, or some other change in the withdrawing state's
preference for international engagement.7 My theory, in contrast,
predicts [that treaty members will react more strongly to withdrawal
than treaty non-members, that this reaction does not depend on the costs
of withdrawal, and that the change in cooperation is driven by other
treaty members' actions]{.underline} rather than the withdrawing state
itself.

#### Withdrawal wrecks cooperation -- breaches trust and wrecks negotiation credibility 

**Schmidt 2021** (Averall Schmidt researches the politics of
international law, focusing on the consequences of states\' decisions to
violate, contest, or withdraw from treaties for the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, "Breach of Trust: How Treaty
Withdrawal

Shapes Cooperation Among States", July 21 2021,
<https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/meyau/> )//MargaretE

My central argument begins from the premise that [unilateral exit
entails the violation of the type of moralistic trust known as
**particularized trust**.]{.underline}13 Trust is the willingness to put
one's wellbeing in another's hands. Moralistic trust is trust based on
the belief that others share your normative commitments. Trust of the
moral variety exists on a continuum from generalized to particularized
trust. Generalized trust is a belief that others are inherently
trustworthy, because everyone is part of the same moral community. It
reflects an optimistic disposition toward human nature. Moving down the
continuum from generalized trust toward particularized trust involves
narrowing the inclusivity of one's community. [Particularized trusters
are those who trust members of their community and regard others with
skepticism.]{.underline} They divide the world into in-groups and
out-groups defined in terms of their normative commitments. The
etymology of particularized trust is that "A trusts B," whereas the
etymology of generalized trust is simply that "A trusts."14 Generalized
trust is dispositional. [Particularized trust is
relational]{.underline}.

[Recent research has linked generalized trust to the emergence and
design of multilateral institutions]{.underline}.15 This research
demonstrates how [variation in trust can explain state entry into
international agreements]{.underline}. Decision-makers high in
generalized trust are more likely to negotiate, conclude, and ratify
multilateral agreements than those with less generalized trust. This
suggests that trust -- and the proclivity of states to enter into
agreements with one another -- is a function of who is sitting at the
negotiating table. But this account is hard-pressed to explain what
happens when trust is broken. As a dispositional characteristic,
individuals' level of generalized trust should not change because
another party walked away from its treaty commitments. As a result,
[explanations based on generalized trust are limited]{.underline} in
their ability to explain how international cooperation evolves following
unilateral exit.

The concept of [particularized trust addresses this
limitation]{.underline}. Because particularized trust entails
categorizing actors based on whether they belong to one's moral
community[, it offers a framework for understanding what happens when
someone exits this community.]{.underline} Particularized trust is
central to constructivist accounts for the emergence of cooperation.
When Wendt writes that trust is the solution to "the fundamental problem
of collective identity formation" he is suggesting that [particularized
trust provides the basis of norms and intersubjectivity.]{.underline}16
Trust is relational for constructivists, particular to groups and pairs
of states. Hemmer and Katzenstein, for instance, use variation in
particularized trust to explain US preferences for the creation of
multilateral security institutions in Europe and the creation of
bilateral institutions in Asia.17 By this logic, [when particularized
trust decreases, states identify with each other less and,
consequentially, enter into fewer multilateral agreements.]{.underline}

**[Unilateral exit violates particularized trust]{.underline}**.
Although states often include provisions for flexibility, escape, and
exit in the design of international agreements, meaning that unilateral
exit is lawful, rule-bound behavior,18 [there is a distinction between
the letter of the law and the spirit of the deal]{.underline}.19 [Even
if states agree on the language of a treaty, they may have differing
expectations concerning how a treaty will work]{.underline} in practice,
especially its [duration and the circumstances that would justify exit.
The one-sided nature of unilateral exit suggests that divergent beliefs
exist.]{.underline}

[Although unilateral exit is lawful behavior, it violates particularized
trust because it transgresses group-based norms.]{.underline} When
states ratify multilateral treaties with one another, they
self-categorize into a group of states defined by a shared commitment to
the treaty. [The norm that agreements must be kept provides that it is
inappropriate to walk away from this commitment, even if the costs of
compliance exceed expectations]{.underline}.20 These norm-based in-group
expectations stand in contrast to the unbridled behavior of non-treaty
members. [When a state exits a treaty unilaterally, it violates the
expectations of appropriate behavior shared by treaty
members]{.underline}, but does not transgress a shared understanding
with non-members. Such "collective experiences" are capable of changing
the moral basis of trust.21 Even though treaty members and non-members
observe the same behavior, only one group has experienced a breach of
trust.

The consequences of violating particularized trust stem from its
normative basis and unique etymology. [Breaking particularized trust
involves the violation of group-based norms; therefore, in-group members
should respond with indignation]{.underline} and out-group members
should not. [These sentiments should be expressed by foreign policy
decision-makers,]{.underline} especially those negotiating with the
withdrawing state and relevant domestic stakeholders. Following a logic
of appropriateness, [treaty members should respond to norm transgression
with social sanctions]{.underline}; out-group members, in contrast,
should take no such action.22 **[One of the ways treaty members enforce
social norms is by "opting out" of future cooperation with the
withdrawing state]{.underline}**. As a punishment, [opting
out]{.underline} is similar to outcasting, which ["involves denying the
disobedient the benefits of social cooperation and
membership]{.underline}."23 But rather than expelling a state from the
community of benefits, opting out occurs when [states systematically
avoid cooperating with a state because of its past norm transgressions.
To opt out is to ostracize]{.underline}. The etymology of particularized
trust -- that "A trusts B" -- suggests that the scope of ostracization
should be wide. As a result, unilateral exit should correspond with a
decrease in the extent to which treaty members are willing to enter into
agreements with the withdrawing state across issue areas.

#### Leaving NATO ends security cooperation -- material goods and wrecked credibility halts negotiations 

**Schmidt 2021** (Averall Schmidt researches the politics of
international law, focusing on the consequences of states\' decisions to
violate, contest, or withdraw from treaties for the Kennedy School of

[Even if unilateral exit is lawful, it can impact the distribution of
material benefits across states]{.underline} by producing an asymmetric
change in states' legal obligations. Prior research has shown that the
nature of strategic interactions varies by issue areas, shaping the
emergence and design of international agreements.41 Koremenos draws a
theoretically motivated distinction concerning the nature of cooperation
in the issue areas of security, economics, human rights, and the
environment.42 I build on this research by considering how the
distributional consequences of unilateral exit varies across these issue
areas.

[Security cooperation is often modeled as an iterated prisoners' dilemma
marked by a concern for relative gains.]{.underline} [States make
themselves vulnerable to opportunism when they abide by security
agreements, because other states may gain an advantage by exploiting
their cooperation.]{.underline}43 Similar issues pertain in the areas of
trade and economic cooperation, where states adjust their trade policies
in order to gain the benefits of comparative advantage, but in doing so
make themselves vulnerable to protectionist policies if their trading
partners renege on their commitments. While some economic agreements
create excludable goods that can be denied to withdrawing states, [exit
nonetheless has direct economic consequences for other treaty members.
**In the areas of security and economic cooperation, there are thus
direct costs to treaty members if another state exits** unilaterally
from an agreement.]{.underline}

The distributional consequences of unilateral exit are different in the
areas of human rights and the environment. In the area of environmental
cooperation, the costs of withdrawal are more diffuse and long-term,
such as those resulting from other treaty members bearing the costs of
pollution or overfishing. Unilateral exits from human rights agreements,
in contrast, tend to produce fewer negative externalities for other
states, because these agreements are primarily designed to resolve
domestic-level commitment problems.

[If unilateral exit exacts a cost on other treaty members, then theories
that explain how states respond to defection can suggest plausible
hypotheses for the consequences of withdrawal on subsequent cooperation.
One way states punish the withdrawing state is by **withholding future
cooperation**.]{.underline} This claim is consistent with the mechanism
of reciprocity which emphasizes the sequential and symmetric exchange of
items by actors.45 Reciprocity suggests that when a state withdraws from
a treaty, their former partners will withhold cooperation in kind.
[Unlike opting out, which predicts that states will abstain from
ratifying agreements with the withdrawing state across issue areas,
reciprocity suggests that states will meet like with like by withholding
cooperation in the issue area of withdrawal.]{.underline}

#### NATO withdrawal halts cooperation -- backlash towards France proves 

**Schmidt 2021** (Averall Schmidt researches the politics of
international law, focusing on the consequences of states\' decisions to
violate, contest, or withdraw from treaties for the Kennedy School of

[French withdrawal was]{.underline} also [costly and politically
salient]{.underline}. [French withdrawal undermined the deterrent threat
at the core of NATO's mission, damaging the credibility of the
alliance]{.underline}. Withdrawal also brought direct material costs.
[It removed the legal basis for the presence of allied military officers
in France,]{.underline} expelling the alliance's headquarters from Paris
and forcing the relocation of NATO to Brussels.78 [French withdrawal
from NATO was also well publicized.]{.underline} It garnered global
media coverage and formed the context of de Gaulle's visits to Moscow
and Phenom Phen in the summer and fall of 1966 in which he asserted
French independence in foreign affairs, challenged US supremacy, and
sought to establish France as a broker in the Cold War. Non-NATO states
were aware of de Gaulle's withdrawal and capable of incorporating the
event into assessments of the reliability of France's treaty
commitments, factors that favor withdrawal as unreliability.

How did entry into multilateral agreements with France change following
withdrawal? Figure 7 presents ratification trends graphically,
representing (as before) the average number of joins by treaty members
with a solid line, the same average for treaty non-members with a dotted
line, and the post-withdrawal period as the grey shaded area. Figure 7
reveals that [NATO members tended to ratify more treaties with France
than non-NATO states in the pre-withdrawal period]{.underline}, as would
be expected. Nonetheless, both groups' trends in ratification behavior
are similar during the five years prior to 1966, when France withdrew
from the NATO SOF agreement. [There is then an abrupt drop during the
next three years in the average number of treaties ratified by NATO
members that include France as a state party relative to this average
among non-NATO states.]{.underline} This relative decrease persists
through de Gaulle's death in 1970, before returning to pre-withdrawal
levels of cooperation.

[This differential shift in the average number of joins by NATO members
and non-members combined with the parallel trends in the pre-withdrawal
period provides suggestive evidence consistent with breach of trust
theory.]{.underline} If anticipation of withdrawal or existing acrimony
in diplomatic relations explained the shift in ratification behavior (as
expected by the byproduct hypothesis) the shift would have occurred
prior to withdrawal. If the change in ratifications was a result of
states learning about the unreliability of France's treaty commitments,
as would be expected by withdrawal as unreliability, then there would be
corresponding shifts in both groups' ratification practices.

Figure 7 departs from the aggregate trends presented in Figure 2 in an
important respect: NATO states' entry into treaties with France returned
to pre-withdrawal levels six years following withdrawal, whereas
[aggregate trends never rebound.]{.underline} Some scholars argue that
the "surprisingly benign" consequences of French withdrawal suggest that
de Gaulle did not intend to subvert the alliance.79 The historical
record indicates, however, **[that withdrawal set in motion mechanisms
capable of undermining the long-term cooperation between NATO members
and France.]{.underline}**

Because French withdrawal was anticipated, President Johnson attempted
to pre-empt retribution by US officials. On March 2, 1966, after de
Gaulle held a press conference suggesting that major decisions were
forthcoming, but prior to an official announcement of withdrawal, the
State Department issued a circular telegram to all NATO missions,
Brussels, and USEC noting that: \[W\]e should lean over backward to be
polite and friendly to France, to President de Gaulle personally, and to
all French government officials. Backbiting, recriminations, attempts to
downgrade the importance of France as a nation, or attempts at reprisals
should be avoided no matter what the temptation\... We should maintain
our support for the Common Market, taking care that we do not seem to
take the lead in any effort to isolate France. If France is to be
isolated, it should clearly be by her own doing and not as the result of
American efforts.80 The telegram attempted to preclude US officials from
ostracizing France. Johnson thus anticipated and sought to guard against
the processes set underway by a breach of trust and the damage that it
could do to broader US foreign policy objectives.

[Although France's withdrawal was expected, NATO members nevertheless
perceived it as a violation of pacta sunt servanda]{.underline}. In a
March 31 memo analyzing France's exit, US Ambassador to France Charles
('Chip') E. Bohlen concluded that de Gaulle announced the withdrawal in
advance of his June trip to Moscow so that his decision to "betray the
Alliance" would not also be seen as colluding with the enemy and that
French negotiations over the structure of NATO initiated by de Gaulle's
1958 letter had all been in bad faith, merely a "\[r\]use" meant to
feign allegiance to the alliance and deflect blame for withdrawal.81
[Prior to withdrawal Bohlen had urged civility and restraint toward de
Gaulle; after withdrawal he advocated a harsh punitive approach to the
French president]{.underline}.82 Withdrawal provoked anger from other
senior policymakers as well.83 In a White House meeting to formulate a
policy response to de Gaulle, Under Secretary of State George Ball
argued that de Gaulle had "repudiated a solemn agreement."84 After de
Gaulle told Secretary of State Dean Rusk that American troops must leave
France, Rusk replied, "Does that include the dead Americans in military
cemeteries as well?"85 Canadian prime minister Lester Pearson later told
President Johnson that he had asked de Gaulle the same question.86
**[Policymakers perceived withdrawal as a violation of France's
normative commitments]{.underline}**

### nato good / withdrawal bad

#### NATO withdrawal fails -- lack of deterrence, irreplaceability, and unchecked Russia risks global conflict

Colorado Tech with a BA and a masters in political science from Cal

[NATO frankly does its best work when no one hears about it. **Its
strength lies in the day-to-day military cooperation it fosters and the
general sense of deterrence and stability it promotes**]{.underline}.
[These contributions are neither as dramatic as facing off against the
Red Army at the height of the Cold War, nor as controversial as the
Libyan intervention, but they would be glaring in their absence. Why
arbitrarily remove the structure that provides that stability---both
with Russia and also among NATO's many disparate members? Withdrawing
NATO protection from the Baltic states or the smaller Balkan members,
for example, will not preclude the possibility of their becoming
involved in a war with Russia or Serbia; just the opposite, **it could
make it more likely.** Once such a conflict begins, is it certain the
United States will not be entangled or affected even if it is no longer
actively participating in NATO?]{.underline} Again, it is worth
reiterating that NATO is an instrument. Many of the alliance's opponents
may actually be opposed to the way the United States and its partners
have employed force since the end of the Cold War---especially in the
case of operations falling under the rubric of regime change. The
argument, implicit in Posen's OpEd, for example, is that NATO needs to
be taken away from reckless U.S. policymakers to prevent them from
future adventures. This argument is backwards. [Yes, the consequences of
three decades of continuous military operations should be examined. But
increasing national restraint and making better strategic decisions
seems like a smarter path than summarily scrapping an effective, tested
tool that could play an essential role in a wiser foreign
policy.]{.underline} NATO's advocates are also prone to hyperbole, but
one word that is not an overstatement is irreplaceable. **[It would be
difficult---if not impossible---to recreate NATO or something like it
from scratch.]{.underline}** Still, [even irreplaceable doesn't imply
permanence if the alliance's value cannot readily be established and
sold to the populations of its constituent members, especially
Americans.]{.underline} Demography is not on the alliance's side. Should
NATO survive to celebrate its centennial, the generation being born at
that time will be as far removed from the end of the Second World War as
someone born in 1969 was from the conclusion of the American Civil War.
Even the September 11th attacks---and NATO's ensuing invocation of
Article 5---will be a half century in the past. In short, shared
historical experience or even simple nostalgia will not be enough to
sustain the alliance through the twenty-first century. [NATO needs to
show that it is not just relevant, but crucial to continued security in
Europe and, to be blunt, the broader interests of its essential member,
the United States. The most effective way of doing that is reinforcing
the image of NATO as a vehicle for stability, something which has been
recently diminished.]{.underline} There are legitimate arguments to be
made that NATO now endangers American security by having antagonized
Russia through enlargement and increased the likelihood of
confrontation, possibly a nuclear one, rather than decreasing it.\[15\]
[That relations between America and Russia---and overall stability in
Eastern Europe---might be far worse without the alliance is also
true,]{.underline} but is a difficult sell in trying to promote the
alliance's relevance. [NATO needs to be an active participant in visibly
promoting stability, beyond the important day-to-day but low-key role it
plays in this regard.]{.underline} Some potential steps are obvious, the
most high profile of which would be a public declaration on closing the
alliance to further expansion after the current candidacy of North
Macedonia is vetted. To be clear, such a move need not be taken in a
vacuum. In general, [NATO must engage with Russia and some sort of quid
pro quo shouldn't be ruled out on ending further expansion of the
alliance]{.underline}. Cessation of Moscow's support for separatist
activities in Transnistria and the Donbass certainly should be on the
table as should guarantees from Russia that Belarus and Ukraine would be
free to pursue their own independent relationships with the West,
perhaps to someday include the possibility of membership in the European
Union if either state wants it.\[16\]

[What would a world without NATO look like?]{.underline} It is a useful
question to ask. For the end of NATO would mean far more than merely the
disappearance of a bureaucracy at the outskirts of Brussels. [[The **end
of NATO**]{.mark} [would mean the end of a]{.mark} unique
institutionalized [**political and military link** between Europe and
North America]{.mark}---[with **consequences**]{.mark} that range from
merely uncomfortable to **outright dangerous**.]{.underline}

[The end of NATO [would be the end of **transatlantic collective
defense**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Europe would have to provide for its
security without the United States. [[Establishing a **purely European
defense**]{.mark}, however, [would **overwhelm** the Europeans
**politically**]{.mark}, **[financially]{.mark}**, [and
**militarily**]{.mark}. Not only would it require significantly higher
defense expenditures, but also **massive investments** in defense
research and development and much more rationalized defense
procurement]{.underline} -- just when the United Kingdom, Europe's
biggest defense player, is distancing itself from the EU. It would
ultimately require a genuine European security policy, including a
consensus on a European nuclear deterrent. [In short, it would require a
**quantum leap** in the process of **European integration** that is
**utterly unrealistic**.]{.underline}

At the same time, [the end of NATO [would **dramatically increase**
Russia's **weight and influence** in Europe]{.mark}an
security]{.underline}. [**[Without]{.mark} the [American

This year, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization marks its 70th
anniversary. In the world of international statecraft, such long-lasting
alliances are exceedingly rare. [NATO's longevity is due in part to the
fact that it combines national interest, which can be fleeting, with
national values, which are hopefully more lasting.]{.underline} The
initial alliance between the United States, Canada, and 10 European
nations founded in 1949 has grown to encompass 29 countries. Once
ratified by all current members, North Macedonia will join as NATO's
30th member. Some, though, most notably the president of the United
States, have questioned whether NATO membership is still in the U.S.
national interest. **[While the White House avers that the U.S.
commitment to NATO remains solid, even the perception of a breach
between Europe and America would foster Russia's longstanding desire to
rupture the alliance.]{.underline}** The Trump administration's concern
over burden sharing is by no means a new issue -- it has been an
off-and-on irritant over much of the alliance's history. In the 1970s,
Europe was spending approximately 45 percent of what the United States
was spending on defense. The Center for Transatlantic Relations notes
that three factors combined to address the disparity: Moscow was
becoming more belligerent, America was preoccupied in a longstanding
conflict in Vietnam, and Europe was enjoying a period of relative
prosperity. By the end of the Cold War, Europe was spending
approximately 78 percent of U.S. levels. Today's situation is somewhat
analogous: Moscow is becoming more belligerent, America is engaged in a
17-year war in Afghanistan (side-by-side with our NATO allies), and
Europe is enjoying relative prosperity. And European defense spending is
beginning to rise. As Daniel Fried, the assistant secretary of state for
Europe from 2005 to 2009, put it, "By all means, America should push for
greater allied defense spending. But today (and everyday) let's also
remember --- and respect --- the sacrifice that others have made for
us." The values that bind the alliance have remained constant, but NATO
has not been static. In fact, [its durability is linked to its
flexibility -- changing and modernizing as threats have grown and
receded. It's important to recognize that NATO succeeded in its core
historical mission -- deterring an aggressive rival and keeping the West
strong and free.]{.underline} Established in the first phase of the Cold
War, NATO was one response to the vacuum created after World War I, when
America sought to disengage from Europe's power struggles and conflicts.
In contrast to the Senate's refusal to approve the treaty establishing
the League of Nations, America sought after World War II to fashion a
new and lasting international architecture. That included the United
Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the forerunner of the World Trade
Organization), and a host of security agreements and alliances, most
notably NATO. Beginning with President Harry S. Truman and continuing
through the Cold War, presidents and Congresses of both parties embraced
this American-made architecture that helped the United States realize
historic prosperity, saw freedom expand across the globe, and prevented
a devastating nuclear war with an aggressive and expansionist Soviet
Union. [While regional conflicts were frequent and often bloody, the
theory of mutually assured destruction (MAD) contained the 50-year
standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union]{.underline}.
The uneasy peace was costly and often tense -- the Cuban Missile Crisis,
conflict in the Middle East, Vietnam -- but a cataclysmic third world
war was avoided. Western resolve, expressed in the alliance, prevented
Soviet aggression and victory. [The reduced tensions of détente largely
fell apart after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, awakening
Americans and Europeans alike to the fact that the Soviets still posed
an existential threat.]{.underline} The decision to deploy a new class
of missiles in Europe spawned the nuclear freeze movement and severely
strained the alliance. [But the fact that NATO held together was a key
moment in the Soviet Union's defeat.]{.underline} Western resolve placed
unsustainable pressure on the Soviets and their allies. The system
collapsed in the 1980s and 1990s, as a new Soviet leader found it
impossible to compete. The rise of the independent labor union
Solidarity in Poland led to free elections, as Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev refused to intervene. The fall of the Berlin Wall and a series
of mostly bloodless revolutions rolled out across Central and Eastern
Europe. And long suppressed nationalism within the Soviet Union -- in
Lithuania, Ukraine, and elsewhere -- led to the dissolution of the USSR
itself on December 26, 1991. The map of Europe was remade. Fifteen
states emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union. Most of them,
including Russia, sought a democratic and free market future. Many
declared their ambition to join the European Union and NATO. Over the
next two decades, 13 post-communist nations took their rightful places
as full members of the North Atlantic Alliance. [But the question arose
-- what was the purpose of NATO when its main foe was no longer a threat
(or even existed)?]{.underline} Since the fall of the Soviet Union and
its Warsaw Pact allies[, NATO has reinvented itself. The alliance built
to face down the Soviets has taken on new challenges and missions,
proving it remains **the most important U.S. alliance.**]{.underline}
[NATO's current mission was laid out in 2010. The alliance remains a
mutual defense pact -- each member commits to defend the others against
attack, including against "new threats to the safety of our
citizens."]{.underline} It also maps out the importance of conflict
management -- preventing and managing conflicts and stabilizing
post-conflict situations. [NATO is committed to working with partners
around the globe, to working toward a world without nuclear weapons, and
to allow European democracies that meet the standards for membership to
join the alliance.]{.underline} One of the first major tests for the
post-Soviet NATO occurred after Yugoslavia's dissolution. [NATO took the
leading role in ending the fighting and bringing stability to Bosnia and
Herzegovina. From 1999 on, NATO has played a similar role in
Kosovo.]{.underline} Ending the bloodshed was a key U.S. political
priority during the Clinton administration. While the United States
could have addressed these crises alone, our NATO partners worked with
us and carried some of the load. After the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001, NATO's Article V was activated for the first and
only time in the alliance's history. Article V of the NATO Treaty
commits each member to defend the others when under attack. For
America's NATO partners, the attacks on Washington and New York were
just the same as an attack on Rome, Berlin, Toronto, or Oslo. Invoking
Article V was more than just a rhetorical expression of solidarity --
our NATO allies, along with other partners like Australia, have fought
with the United States in Afghanistan. More than 1,000 soldiers from
NATO partners have been killed. [While you may disagree on the merits of
American involvement in Bosnia, Kosovo, or Afghanistan -- they were
national security priorities of the U.S. government. In each conflict,
America's NATO partners took up arms in American-led engagements. Having
allied support lessened the burden and furthered the security priorities
of the United States. Sadly, the original rationale for NATO has
returned in new, insidious ways. The Russian experiment with democracy
that begin in the late 1980s has been all but extinguished. Vladimir
Putin's Russia has moved away from liberalism and democracy toward a
state now best characterized by authoritarianism, crony capitalism, and
corruption]{.underline}. Most importantly, Putin has acted aggressively
to restore power and land lost when the Soviet Empire imploded. In 2014,
Russia annexed Crimea, on the south of Ukraine. Moscow has sought to
encourage separatist movements in several former Soviet republics. In
2014, Russia stepped up its longstanding military interference in
Ukraine by annexing Crimea. And in Central and Eastern Europe, Russia
has pursued aggressive policies, aimed at restoring its influence.
Countries across the region have faced new kinds of threats, as Moscow
works to manipulate and discredit democratic institutions. Moscow has
also sought to silence critics and boost its influence in longstanding
democracies. In 2006, former intelligence agent Alexander Litvinenko was
assassinated in the United Kingdom. Cyberattacks have been detected in
Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and elsewhere. And in
the United States, Russia undertook an unprecedented campaign to stoke
divisions and influence the 2016 election campaign. While the immediate
threat of military conflict between Russia and the United States is low,
[Russia and other states pose a serious and changing threat to America
and its allies. **NATO is an essential first line of
defense.**]{.underline}. [NATO's mission remains first as a military
alliance, but from the earliest days, it was also a community of values.
And while at times NATO has chosen to look the other way, promoting
democracy among its members has always been a
consideration.]{.underline} Article 10 of the NATO Charter states that
by unanimous agreement, any other European state that can further the
principles of the alliance and contribute to its security may be asked
to join. Greece and Turkey joined the alliance in 1952, even though both
countries underwent long periods of military rule. [Even today, with
rising concerns about democratic backsliding in countries like Hungary
and Turkey, both countries remain active members of the
alliance]{.underline}. [But NATO's commitment to values became much more
explicit as the former communist nations began jockeying for
inclusion.]{.underline} Would-be members must demonstrate they are
market economies and stable democracies based on a respect for human
rights and the rule of law. Aspirants must live in peace with their
neighbors, peacefully resolving disputes. And joining NATO requires
civilian and democratic control over the military. [Seventy years on,
NATO remains a vital partnership and resource for the United States. It
has contributed blood and treasure to the two most recent major
conflicts -- Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}. It has adapted in
response to the new threats emanating from Moscow, shoring up defenses
in the Baltic region, partnering with states in Russia's crosshairs like
Ukraine and Georgia, and providing important communications and
coordination to defend against the ongoing cyberwarfare. NATO's critics
are not wrong to urge increased defense spending across the alliance.
Most American presidents have done so and our NATO allies are responding
to the call. But the United States as a global power will always
shoulder a greater share of the burden. As this history shows, **[we
should look at NATO not as a drain on our resources, but rather as a net
plus]{.underline}**. America and its NATO allies have faced tensions and
estrangement over policy issues. [But even when tensions have been high,
leaders on both sides of the Atlantic have always recognized that the
alliance is mutually beneficial.]{.underline} Fundamentally, [NATO has
endured because it is a community of shared values -- of democracy,
freedom, market economics, solidarity, and mutual respect. The United
States and our partners share a strong interest in preserving this
partnership -- it has worked to our common benefit for 70 years and
continues to do so today.]{.underline}

insurgents. It [has made no concessions to Moscow]{.underline} regarding
that conflict. [It has [increased sanctions against Russia]{.mark} and
[boosted America's military presence]{.mark} in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}. [It has increased funding to the European Defense
Initiative,]{.underline} bolstered U.S. defense spending, held Russia
accountable for its breach of the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty) Treaty, and explored the place of low-yield nuclear weapons as a
necessary component of the American arsenal to deter Russian aggression.
At the same time, the [president's calls for increased European defense
spending have had]{.underline} some useful [effects.]{.underline}
Virtually [**[all NATO allies]{.mark}** have [i**ncreased**
their]{.mark} levels of **[defense spending]{.mark}** over the past two
years.]{.underline} As president, Mr. Trump has regularly reiterated his
support for NATO. The concomitant [[emphasis on allied burden-sharing is
not unreasonable]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Eisenhower regularly insisted.

In keeping with its treaty powers under the U.S. Constitution, Congress
should not be passive on this issue. [Last week, a bipartisan group of
lawmakers introduced a bill to express continuing congressional support
for the NATO alliance.]{.underline} The bill passed by a vote of 357 to
22 in the House of Representatives. The [Senate is working on similar
legislation]{.underline}.

Public-opinion polls taken over the last three years show that a solid
majority of Trump supporters, conservatives, Republicans, and Americans
continue to back the NATO alliance. Conservative voters in heartland
states such as Wisconsin certainly expect Europeans to do their fair
share in defending themselves. But they do not oppose NATO. On the
contrary, they support it.

An overarching support for America's Western alliance has been a key
component in the conservative foreign-policy approach since Eisenhower's
time. It remains relevant to this day. As conservative Republicans and
other Americans consider the costs and benefits of the U.S. alliance
system, recall Ike's wise recommendation: "Now boys, let's not make our
mistakes in a hurry."

#### NATO is not to blame for the Russian invasion 

**Stemplowska 22** \-- Zofia Stemplowska is a Professor of Political
Theory in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the
University of Oxford. Published April 27, 2022. "NATO enlargement is not
to blame for Russia's war in Ukraine"
<https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2022/04/27/nato-enlargement-is-not-to-blame-for-russias-war-in-ukraine/>
//DG

Is NATO enlargement partly responsible for the Russia-Ukraine war? Zofia
Stemplowska argues that rather than blaming countries in eastern Europe
for their desire to join NATO, we would be better served by examining
the role Russian energy exports to western Europe have played in
propping up Vladimir Putin's regime.

**[Many]{.underline}** voices in the UK and US press -- in the Financial
Times, the New York Times, the Guardian, and others -- **[suggest that
NATO is partly to blame for the Russian war of aggression against
Ukraine]{.underline}**. The argument is that by accepting NATO
enlargement up to Russia's borders, and by failing to decisively rule
out Ukrainian membership, NATO holds some responsibility for Russia's
invasion.

Does it matter whether NATO is partly to blame now that the war is
underway, and all reasonable people condemn the aggression? I would
argue that it does. First, we owe those who are defending themselves the
correct moral evaluation of the causes of the war. Second, our views
about who is to blame for a war influence our views on what is
permissible as part of it, what is to be done after it has ended, and --
crucially -- how to behave in similar situations in future, when, for
instance, Finland and Sweden apply for NATO membership.

However, blaming someone does not merely mean attributing to them causal
responsibility for an outcome. It involves suggesting that things should
have been done differently and that there are things to answer for.
**[The reality is that western states do hold some blame]{.underline}**
for making the invasion possible, **[but not because of NATO
enlargement]{.underline}**. **[By buying Russian energy]{.underline}**
on Russian terms, **[western states have effectively
facilitated]{.underline}** corruption and authoritarianism inside
**[Russia]{.underline}**, strengthening Vladimir Putin's regime despite
its treatment of its neighbours.

Russia's fears

Supporters of the 'blame NATO' argument offer the following rationale.
Russia saw the enlargement of NATO as a threat to its security.
Nonetheless, NATO proceeded to admit new members right up to Russia's
borders and refused to rule out further enlargement. The resulting war
is unjustified since it is an act of aggression. But this act of
aggression is in part an expression of Russia's legitimate fear for its
interests which it views as threatened by NATO.

When talking about Russia, I have in mind the Russian ruling group --
chiefly Vladimir Putin -- whose world view may be inaccurate but whose
access to information is not restricted. Ordinary Russian citizens, in
contrast, now find it increasingly difficult to learn what the world is
like as opposed to what Putin would like them to believe.

When it comes to Russian officials, there can be no doubt that they have
repeatedly expressed fears concerning NATO enlargement. It is worth
noting that Russia has talked of NATO 'expansion', but that language
carries connotations of territorial annexation. The Russian Federation
'expanded' when it annexed Crimea. NATO was enlarged, just as the EU
was, when the new member states willingly joined.

Boris Yeltsin is quoted as saying that NATO enlargement would be
'nothing but humiliation for Russia.' He suggested a pan-European peace
force. Regarding Ukraine in particular, the head of the CIA, William
Burns, wrote in 2008 that the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO 'is the
brightest of all red lines for the Russian elite (not just Putin). In
more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian
players...I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as
anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.'

In light of the present-day expressions of fear from Russia about the
allegedly genocidal government in Ukraine, we know that Russia's
assertions about its fears can be entirely made up. But even if we
credit the past and present statements about NATO enlargement as
genuine, we can ask ourselves how legitimate or reasonable they were or
are. If the fears express a desire to dominate Russia's neighbours then
those who indulge in them are to blame when those neighbours seek
protection.

Russia's fears express expectations of domination of the region

So how reasonable was Russia's fear of NATO enlargement in the 1990s and
since? NATO invaded Afghanistan and a US-led coalition of states invaded
Iraq. But these wars were not against Russia. What of the fact that
Russia was previously invaded from its western borders? Napoleon tried
to conquer it. Hitler invaded it two years after both him and Stalin
together invaded Poland (an act of long-planned aggression that the
Soviet Union presented at the time as a defensive move). The
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth captured the throne in Moscow in the
early 17th century.

But it is not reasonable to assume that the past and disavowed conduct
of a country is bound to be repeated no matter how the country has
changed. NATO members do not celebrate the past Polish, French and
German aggressions on Russia. They cannot be reasonably seen as
indicative of any current aspirations. If we thought countries could not
change, we would have to conclude that France currently poses a threat
to the UK and Germany to Poland. Instead, Poland rejoiced when in the
first week of the Russian war against Ukraine, on 27 February 2022,
Germany announced its rearmament.

It is difficult to understand why Russia would fear its neighbours
joining NATO if it cared about its own safety rather than its control of
the region where it once had an empire. Why is it a 'humiliation' for
Russia, as Yeltsin suggested, to have NATO members as its neighbours? A
humiliation, moreover, that has to be dealt with, by Putin, with
military attacks.

Why was there not a single voice in Russia in 2008, as Burns reported,
that argued it would be acceptable for Ukraine to join NATO? If the fear
in Russia is, as sometimes stated, that Ukraine's nationalist policies
threaten a civil war in Ukraine, which in turn threatens Russia' border
security, then we should expect at least some voices arguing for Ukraine
to join NATO and the EU. Russia's borders are the most stable where its
neighbours have managed to join NATO and the EU.

So how does **[the Russian government]{.underline}** portray NATO as a
threat to itself? It **[falsely claims that its own aggressions towards
its neighbours are defensive]{.underline}**. In effect, Russia attacks
with lethal force and claims to be defending itself. **[It is the
equivalent of an abuser justifying the murder of their
victim]{.underline}** on the grounds that they both have a right to
defend themselves. **[The 'blame NATO' argument obscures this asymmetry
in NATO-Russia relations. It does so when it credits Russia's fear as
legitimate.]{.underline}**

Blaming the victims

The 'blame NATO' argument also fails to credit the claims of the new,
and aspiring, NATO members that Russia's threat fully justifies NATO's
enlargement. Ukraine's sovereign and democratic aspirations to join
NATO, though unsuccessful, were purely defensive. Ukraine was occupied
by Russia up to 1991 and for centuries beforehand.

It suffered the Holodomor in the 1930s: the deaths of millions as a
result of Soviet policies that created a famine in Ukraine. The
occupation and the brutal treatment of Ukrainians has not been disavowed
by the current government of Russia, which sees itself as the inheritor
of the Soviet Union and the Tsarist imperial vision beforehand. Ukraine
has also suffered malicious interventions from Russia in its politics
and ongoing attacks and coercive controlling of some of its territory --
all within the last decade.

Russia's insistence that Ukraine is not allowed, on pain of invasion, to
democratically decide to join NATO and the EU amounts to insisting that
countries that share a border with Russia are not entitled to be
sovereign. For the same reason, those who mention what Russia allegedly
was or was not 'promised' about Ukraine by the US or NATO miss the
fundamental point that Russia is not entitled to decide what that future
will be.

Some countries that had been dominated or controlled by the Soviet Union
have succeeded in joining NATO. The narrative of NATO 'expansionism',
which presents it as a negligent or even offensive strategy, obscures
how difficult it was for those new member states to join. The fact that
Russia continued to be feared by those states despite the demise of the
Soviet bloc reflected Russia's insistence that it would not accept their
democratic decisions; that there was either going to be a new world
order approved by Russia or no order at all.

This unwillingness to grant agency to the new member states is visible
in much of the media coverage of the war in Ukraine. Questions such as
'should NATO fear Putin?' are sometimes posed and answered in the
negative. It is true that Putin does not threaten the sovereignty of the
old NATO members through the conventional method of territorial war. But
if we see NATO as composed of all its current members, including those
that have good reason to fear Putin, then **[blaming NATO enlargement
for Russia's aggression]{.underline}** -- and blaming Ukraine for
aspiring to be in NATO -- **[means blaming the victims.]{.underline}**

#### Russian aggression not due to NATO

**Popova and Shevel 22** \-- Maria Popova is Jean Monnet Chair and
Associate Professor of Political Science at McGill University. Oxana
Shevel is an Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science
at Tufts University's School of Arts and Sciences. Published February

<https://www.justsecurity.org/80343/russias-new-assault-on-ukraine-is-not-entirely-maybe-not-even-largely-about-nato/>
//DG

In his Feb. 15 Just Security article "Ukraine: Unleashing the Rhetorical
Dogs of War," Barry Posen argued that NATO and Ukraine should have cut a
deal with Russia because the Ukrainian military would surely be defeated
by Russia without direct U.S./Western military participation and U.S.
offers of equipment were only encouraging a potential Ukrainian
insurgency against Russian occupation that would be as bloody as it
would be futile. The prescription depends entirely on Posen's assumption
that to satisfy Russia, all Ukraine would have had to do would be "to
swallow the bitter pill of accepting armed neutrality between NATO and
Russia, rather than NATO membership."

This assumption contradicts events of recent months and the historical
record. While Vladimir Putin has claimed that his goal is keeping
Ukraine out of NATO, he also insisted that he was just conducting
military exercises. Instead, he is invading Ukraine again. He likewise
insisted in 2014 that he wasn't capturing Crimea, despite the presence
of his unidentified "Little Green Men" and his subsequent annexation of
the peninsula, or that he was not fighting in Ukraine's Donbas area in
the east all these years, despite all evidence to the contrary. There is
no reason to take Putin at his word. His Feb. 21 diatribe conferring
Russian recognition of independence for the two eastern Ukrainian
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and his order for Russian troops to move
in as ostensible "peacekeepers" shows clearly his disdain for diplomatic
resolutions.

Moreover, **[this is not even primarily about NATO]{.underline}**.

NATO's eastward expansion may have played a role in straining the
relationship between Russia and the West, but mainly because, for
Russia, seeing former satellites eagerly abandon it for the greener
pastures of Euro-Atlantic integration stung. However, **[Putin's
rhetoric and actions over almost two decades reveal that his goals
extend beyond imposing neutrality on Ukraine or even staving off further
NATO expansion. The larger objective is to re-establish Russian
political and cultural dominance over a nation that Putin sees as one
with Russia]{.underline}**, and then follow up by undoing the European
rules-based order and security architecture established in the aftermath
of World War II. **[Given these goals, Ukrainian neutrality is a
woefully insufficient concession for Putin.]{.underline}**

**[If Russia's main concern had been NATO enlargement, it would have
reacted with rhetoric and/or hostile actions in its neighborhood after
each step in the NATO expansion process]{.underline}**. The largest wave
of NATO's eastward expansion took place in March 2004, when seven
Eastern European countries joined, including the formerly Soviet Baltic
states. Russia "grumbled," as the New York Times put it then, by
adopting a Duma resolution criticizing the expansion, but **[no hostile
and sustained rhetoric followed about NATO enlargement]{.underline}** as
a Western plot against Russian interests.

#### BRI has no plan and causes massive debt -- it fails to do anything 

**Wan 19** -- Andrew Wan is a research assistant. ("A ROAD TO NOWHERE?
PROBLEMS WITH CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE," Baker Institute. June
27^th^, 2019.
<https://blog.bakerinstitute.org/2019/06/27/a-road-to-nowhere-problems-with-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative/>)
CTF

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) may be the most talked-about
development plan of the century. Xi Jinping's signature plan has
captured the world's attention since its announcement in 2013, with
comparisons drawn to the ancient Silk Road and the Marshall Plan. But
recently, worldwide coverage of the BRI has grown less favorable and
more critical. Has BRI lost its luster?

The BRI now includes around 3,000 projects, according to official
Chinese sources. The majority of the BRI projects involve constructing
infrastructure to facilitate trade, which requires collaborating with
partner countries to secure lending agreements and territory rights.
BRI's flagship project and biggest success is the China-Pakistan
Economic Corridor (CPEC), a road and cable link between Pakistan's
Gwadar port to Xinjiang, China. China's BRI relies on projects financed
by Chinese policy and commercial banks rather than FDI, which requires
massive capital flow to partner countries in the form of Chinese loans.
This model makes sense when considering China's industrial overcapacity
dilemma; facing economic setbacks, China has already begun consolidating
manufacturing companies to prevent defaults on loans. China sees foreign
projects as an easy way for its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to secure
contracts and minimize losses.

However, these [massive lending projects have led to partner countries
accruing extreme debt]{.underline}. This problem was brought to the
forefront of China's second Belt and Road Forum in April. [Several
previous delegations refused to attend this year, protesting growing
concerns that China both has unethical standards and leverages debts as
a diplomatic bargaining chip in its BRI strategy]{.underline}. Notably,
Turkey also cited concerns for China's blatant oppression, through heavy
policing and internment camps, of Uighurs living along BRI pathways.
[Malaysia's prime minister, during renegotiations of nearly \$23 billion
in rail/pipeline deals, called BRI agreements "unequal treaties" and "a
new version of colonialism" before cancelling the deals altogether.
Other countries have already paid the price. Sri Lanka's inability to
resolve an \$8 billion loan for its Hambantota Port in 2017 led to a
debt-for-equity swap accompanied by a 99-year lease for managing the
port. Even Pakistan's CPEC venture has necessitated a \$6 billion
bailout from the IMF. Debt distress is a common trend with BRI projects,
and although asset seizure is rare, this trend raises valid concerns
about the sustainability and methods of BRI projects]{.underline}.

It remains unclear the degree to which BRI, a Chinese-led bilateral
initiative that employs some multilateral mechanisms to achieve
financing goals, will be guided by multilateral standards on debt
sustainability. A key factor in creating and maintaining successful
deals lies in the stability of partner countries. BRI's partners tend to
welcome China's "no strings attached" style of investment compared to
lending by Western powers conditioned on environmental concerns, human
rights, and other obligations. [Although China's system is appealing for
many developing countries, it has enabled corruption while allowing
governments to burden their countries with unpayable debts.]{.underline}
The reality is that, apart from pushing its political agenda, the West's
requirements were attached in order to lower the risk of failure. The
BRI's lack of requirements signals either an absence of educated,
informed planning or a deliberate decision to create debt stress in
BRI's partners.

The instinct may be to accept the latter conclusion, believing criticism
that the BRI's underlying motive is to expand China's geopolitical
influence through a veil of economic development. But the former seems
just as plausible. For all of its hype, [no one, not even China, seems
to know exactly what the BRI is. Aside from vague policy objectives,
there are no concrete policies that define the BRI. This lack of vision
and cohesion has already led to widespread inefficiency]{.underline}.
Studies have demonstrated that BRI projects do not align with the BRI's
proposed "geographic corridors." [This incoherence, combined with
looming industrial overcapacity, paints a credible picture that the BRI
is demand-driven and opportunistic rather than supply-driven and
centrally planned. Additionally, the vague nature of the BRI allows its
brand to be extended to almost anything, from fashion shows to dentistry
to projects that lack any Chinese involvement, all of which damage the
credibility of BRI. Distrust of the BRI brand, in turn, stifles private
investment domestically]{.underline} (only 12% of FDI goes to BRI
countries) [and abroad]{.underline} (former UK PM David Cameron's
UK-China fund is struggling to secure investors), which ensures that the
BRI continues to rely on precarious sovereign lending projects.

[The Heads of State and Government of the 30 members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have adopted NATO 2030, "a
transatlantic agenda for the future," as well as a Climate Change and
Security Action Plan]{.underline}. [The Action Plan provides a framework
to deliver on the Climate Change and Security Agenda endorsed by
NATO]{.underline} Foreign Ministers on 23-24 March 2021. The NATO Deputy
Secretary-General said the decisions make the fight against climate
change an important task for NATO for the first time.

The leaders gathered for a one-day meeting on 14 June 2021, in Brussels,
Belgium, resulting in the Brussels Summit Communique. In the Summit
outcome, the leaders identify climate change as a "threat multiplier
that impacts Allied security" and say it tests resilience and civil
preparedness, affects planning and the resilience of military
installations and critical infrastructure, and "may create harsher
conditions for our operations.

In the Communique, the leaders agree to:

[Aim for NATO to become the leading international organization in
understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on
security;]{.underline}

[Significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from military
activities and installations, formulate a target for reducing GHG
emissions by NATO political and military structures and facilities, and
assess the feasibility of reaching net zero emissions by
2050;]{.underline}

[Initiate a regular high-level dialogue on climate and security to
exchange views and coordinate further action; and]{.underline}

[Incorporate climate change considerations into NATO's full spectrum of
work, including defense planning, capability development, and civil
preparedness and exercises.]{.underline}

Also adopted on 14 June, the action plan explains that climate change
makes it harder for militaries to carry out their tasks, due to greater
temperature extremes, sea level rise, rapid changes in precipitation
patterns, and an increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather
events. The effects of climate change (e.g. desertification and the
opening up of new shipping lanes) may influence the behavior of national
governments in ways that increase instability and competition. In
addition, the disproportionate impacts of climate change on women and
girls and poor, vulnerable, or marginalized populations can create
conditions to be exploited in ways that threaten or challenge the
Alliance, the action plan states.

[The action plan includes conducting annual assessments of the impact of
climate change on NATO's strategic environment as well as on missions
and operations. It says NATO must account for impacts of climate change
on security in order to perform its three core tasks: collective
defense; crisis management; and cooperative security.]{.underline}

NATO will issue its first Climate Change and Security Progress Report at
the 2022 Summit to track progress and re-assess the level of ambition.

What would a world without NATO look like? It is a useful question to
ask. For the end of NATO would mean far more than merely the
disappearance of a bureaucracy at the outskirts of Brussels. [The end of
NATO would mean the end of a unique institutionalized political and
military link between Europe and North America---with consequences that
range from merely uncomfortable to outright dangerous.]{.underline}

The end of NATO would be the end of transatlantic collective defense.
Europe would have to provide for its security without the United States.
[Establishing a purely European defense, however, would **overwhelm the
Europeans politically, financially, and militarily**. Not only would it
require significantly higher defense expenditures, but also massive
investments in defense research and development and much more
rationalized defense procurement]{.underline} -- just when the United
Kingdom, Europe's biggest defense player, is distancing itself from the
EU. It would ultimately require a genuine European security policy,
including a consensus on a European nuclear deterrent. In short, it
would require a quantum leap in the process of European integration that
is utterly unrealistic.

At the same time, [the end of NATO would dramatically increase Russia's
weight and influence in European security. Without the American
commitment to the old continent, the opportunities for Russia to divide
and marginalize Europe would grow]{.underline}. This would be a
strategic disaster in particular for many [countries in the post-Soviet
space, who would be condemned, once again, to fall within Russia's
sphere of influence.]{.underline}

With the end of NATO, [Europe and North America would also lose an
important framework for legitimizing the collective use of military
power]{.underline}. Ambitious long-term stabilization operations like
the one in Afghanistan are only possible in a transatlantic context.
While ad hoc military coalitions between the United States and some
European states would still be possible, [the end of joint military
planning and regular exercising within NATO would rapidly downgrade
military interoperability]{.underline}.

The end of NATO would also encourage a regionalization of European
security. Without the Alliance as a strategic framework for balancing
different regional concerns, [Southern European nations would likely
concentrate on the Maghreb and the Middle East, while Eastern European
states would focus on Russia]{.underline}. [None]{.underline} of these
regional groupings, however, [would be politically coherent and
militarily powerful enough to exert decisive influence in these areas.
The result would be a further weakening of European
security.]{.underline}

By contrast, [the end of NATO would not achieve what some may hope for:
to free the United States of a major financial burden. Since the US
defense budget reflects the country's global reach, the end of NATO
would provide only marginal savings]{.underline}. By ceding its role as
a "European power," however, the United States would not only lose
strategically important military bases on the old continent, but also
its political influence in European security affairs, and the stability
generated through daily consultations with its NATO Allies. [The
geopolitical winners would be Russia, China, and all those who seek to
weaken the role of the United States in upholding international
order.]{.underline} This would not just be a bad deal, a term that is
now increasingly used in international relations. It would be an awful
deal.

Concerns are growing in many European countries that they can no longer
depend on the United States and the security guarantees enshrined in
Article 5 of the NATO treaty. President Trump's decision to withdraw US
forces from Syria marked the end of US reliability. Doubts about
America's trustworthiness have produced a flurry of driveling speeches
in 2018 on the idea of a European army. So -- what about it?

It is an old idea, which failed first in 1954 when the French National
Assembly refused to ratify the European Defence Union treaty. It has
since resurfaced from time to time but was never agreed upon and
implemented. Will it fare better now, five years after the wake-up call
produced by Russia's illegal seizure of the Crimea from Ukraine?

Quite a few initiatives have been launched in recent years. Twenty five
EU members agreed on establishing the Permanent Structured Cooperation
(PESCO). Its tiny steps towards building common force components
compelled some to rekindle dreams of a European Defense Union. Within
NATO, a similar German initiative was agreed upon: the NATO Framework
Concept (NFC). Other political ideas have popped up, such as the
creation of a European Security Council, the establishment of a Defense
Committee of the European Parliament and the suggestion -- a ridiculous
one considering its legal impossibility -- that France renounce its
permanent membership in the UN Security Council and hand it over to the
EU. While all were well-intended, [there is simply no coherent political
will to establish a common defense of Europe, to accept majority
decisions or to transfer the defense portion of national sovereignty to
a supranational organization -- even a European one.]{.underline}

At any rate, [such a body would have to be more inclusive than the EU.
Defending Europe is politically impossible without the inclusion of the
United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland and even Turkey]{.underline}. And in
terms of geostrategy, [it is not feasible without control of the North
Atlantic and adjacent parts of the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}.

[As long as this reality persists, there will be no meaningful European
Security and Defense Strategy leading to command and control
arrangements, to joint operational concepts and to a common and, above
all, comprehensive planning process encompassing all political and
diplomatic tools: economic instruments, police capacities, security and
disaster relief elements and military forces that can operate throughout
Europe and its periphery on land, in the air, at sea, in outer space
**and in cyberspace.**]{.underline}

[None of the steps taken so far make much of a difference. The sad
European reality will thus continue]{.underline}. Our armies will
comprise 17 different tanks, 26 different howitzers, 20 different combat
aircraft and 29 different frigates or destroyers. Europe's defense
budgets combined total approximately 50 percent of the US budget, while
the military manpower of the Europeans is close to 50 percent greater
than that of the US, yet the combat power of the Europeans is at best 20
percent of what the US armed forces can marshal.

[Moreover, a unanimous decision on the use of European military power is
rather unlikely; if such a decision were made, the command arrangements
would be patchy at best]{.underline}. The EU Battlegroups established in
2004 is a telling example: They never saw action.

#### The EU cannot fill in -- failed on Ukraine and are reliant on NATO

in Ukraine"

//DG

**[The Russia-Ukraine war has revealed Europe's inability to protect the
Ukrainians and to deter Russia]{.underline}** from invading Ukraine, as
happened in the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Why did Europe fail
to prevent this war?

First and foremost, due to *security idiosyncrasies**[.]{.underline}***
**[Europe is not a collective security guarantor]{.underline}**. It
dismissed this opportunity in 1954 when France refused to establish a
European Defence Community (EDC). Thus, despite continuous efforts ever
since, Europe does not have an army nor a deterrent capability. **[It
is, in fact, highly dependent on NATO]{.underline}** and individual
nuclear powers (predominantly the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK and
France) to guarantee its collective security.

However, the Russo-Ukrainian war displays the Euro-Atlantic community's
inability to maintain security assurances previously given to Kyiv under
the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. In this political agreement, the US, the
UK and Russia pledged not to use military force against Ukraine in
exchange for it renouncing the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the
Soviet Union. Russia violated this agreement at least twice -- with the
2014 annexation of Crimea and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine -- and the
Euro-Atlantic guarantor countries failed to protect Ukraine.

However, the Memorandum's greatest weakness lay in the fact that it was
only politically, and not legally, binding. This is why Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy demands legally binding security
guarantees instead of the Memorandum's politically binding security
assurances.

As a non-nuclear weapon state, which is not protected under a security
guarantee by a nuclear weapon state or a nuclear alliance such as NATO,
Ukraine was exposed to aggression or intended regime change carried out
by an NPT-recognised nuclear weapon state. Hence, Europe and NATO could
not have provided a nuclear umbrella to a non-allied state such as
Ukraine. Without security guarantees or NATO's extended nuclear
deterrence, Ukraine was on its own in its direct confrontation against
Russia.

Given the inability of major nuclear powers to uphold the Budapest
Memorandum and the difficulty of enforcing credible security assurances
due to Moscow's actions, Ukraine proposed, on 29thMarch, security
guarantees in which guarantor countries (such as the P5) must consult
each other within three days after the beginning of military aggression
or hybrid war. Within this scheme, after consultations, this group of
countries must provide aid to Kyiv by sending troops, supplying weapons,
and protecting Ukraine's airspace. Ultimately, this proposal would
exclude security guarantees potentially given by NATO or the EU and
would 'deresponsibilize' Europe as a collective security guarantor of
Ukraine.

The second reason Europe failed to prevent Putin's war in Ukraine is
because of nuclear policy choices. **[The EU is basically a
non]{.underline}**- **[actor]{.underline}** (in proliferation not a
nuclear deterrent one) who supports the NPT as the cornerstone of the
global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime. Since Ukraine's
independence in 1991, the EU has shown that its interests lie primarily
in the physical protection of nuclear facilities and materials of the
former Soviet states, leading to the establishment of TACIS. Indeed,
**[Brussels]{.underline}** **[proved to be more concerned about the
energy aspects]{.underline}** of nuclear security, generated mainly by
the outcome of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, **[than with the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.]{.underline}**

It was only in the aftermath of Moscow's invasion of Crimea and Donbass
in 2014 that the EU's Russia policy took Ukraine's security seriously
into account. But Brussels did not provide nuclear deterrent
capabilities against Russia for the reasons stated above and, most
importantly, as it is a de facto NPT regime guarantor.

The EU is critical of the view that more nuclear weapons can induce
stability and decrease the chances of crisis escalation (nuclear
stability theory), prominently defended by neo-realist Kenneth Waltz. As
an NPT regime guarantor, Brussels supports the idea that nuclear
proliferation is potentially the greatest threat to international and
European security, requiring a concerted and multilateral response. For
example, the 2003 EU Strategy against Proliferation of WMD stated that
the spread of nuclear weapons to additional states not only increases
the likelihood of interstate nuclear conflict but increases the chances
of nuclear material falling into the hands of violent non-state groups
who are free from the threat of nuclear retaliation.

Therefore, **[the EU has been more politically engaged]{.underline}** in
ensuring Kyiv would not obtain nuclear weapons (mentioned, for example,
in Article 11 of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement) **[than in
providing Ukraine with]{.underline}** some kind of
'**[security]{.underline}** (nuclear) umbrella'.

The third reason is due to divergent political interests among EU member
states. Since March 2014, the **[EU]{.underline}** has adopted a strict
non-recognition policy regarding Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea.
This policy led to substantive sanctions against Russia and prompted the
EU to agree on five guiding principles to punish Russia's aggression
against Ukraine. However, these **[actions did not deter
Moscow]{.underline}** in Ukraine nor prevent the EU from negotiating
trade and energy deals with Russia. **[A lack of coherence among EU
members affected the effective implementation of]{.underline}** the
guiding principles and restrictive **[measures]{.underline}** due to
different political interests and positions towards Russia conditioned
by threat perceptions, economic interests,and energy dependence.

#### Turn: The EU is too reliant on Russian energy to effectively deter -- without NATO, no deterrence

//DG

Before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, four key threat perception
conclusions emerged: 1) a state geographically close to an adverse
nuclear power increases threat perception (e.g. Finland and Sweden); 2)
a state geographically far from an adverse nuclear power decreases
threat perception (e.g. Portugal and Spain); 3) a shared history of
conflict increases threat perception (e.g. the Baltic States and
Poland); 4) a non-shared history of conflict decreases threat perception
(e.g. Italy). In sum, the different degrees of threat perception of each
European state towards Russia undermined the idea of European solidarity
and cohesion and, ultimately, the effectiveness of the EU as a political
player with regard to Ukraine.

**[Europe's energy dependence is another]{.underline}** conditioning
**[factor]{.underline}** of political divergence **[within the
EU.]{.underline}** For example, **[the impact of Russia's policy over
EU]{.underline}** politics towards Ukraine, especially through its
bargaining power **[in the energy sector]{.underline}** (namely through
Russian business proxies Nord stream and Gazprom), **[led the Union to
become more inactive and less effective]{.underline}**. **[Other Russian
activities]{.underline}** -- such as increased activities of Russian
funded media, intensified contact between Brussels and other European
countries with Moscow, the spread of disinformation, and the sponsoring
of Eurosceptic political forces -- **[impacted the ability of the EU to
act effectively in opposition to Russian aggression.]{.underline}**

Furthermore, while the implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association
Agreement served as an important display of the EU's economic and
political force (soft power) towards Kyiv, **[Russia continued to be one
of the EU's main economic and trade partners]{.underline}**. In fact,
**[European countries with different economic interests continued to
negotiate large trade and energy deals with Russia at least until
February 2022.]{.underline}**

This contrasting dual **[approach led to]{.underline}**, even if
indirectly, **[the continuous funding of Moscow's aggression
machine]{.underline}** in Ukraine. For example, despite the 2014 EU arms
embargo, according to a recent report, ten EU member states (France,
Germany, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Finland,
Slovakia and Spain) exported weapons to Russia until at least 2020.
These countries relied on the use of a legal loophole in EU regulations
that allowed the continuation of arms exports "contracts concluded
before 1 August 2014 or ancillary contracts necessary for the execution
of such contracts". These legal loopholes, combined with other
conditioning factors of political divergence, contributed to the
half-hearted implementation of the EU sanctions policy.

Ultimately, **[Europe could not prevent a Russian military
invasion]{.underline}** of Ukraine **[because of the EU's]{.underline}**
security idiosyncrasies, nuclear policy choices, **[divergent political
interests, energy dependency and ineffective]{.underline}** sanctions
**[policy on Russia]{.underline}**. Despite its failure to prevent the
war, Europe has taken relevant steps over the past two months to respond
to the invasion: They have rapprochement with their Atlantic allies (the
UK and the US) and, among other initiatives, have established a
Strategic Compass on Security and Defence, which could represent a
unique opportunity for the EU tobecome a "more assertive and decisive
security provider".

The European ambition to seek strategic autonomy amid rising concerns
over U.S. commitments to the continent and over Russia's revisionist
behavior raises an important counterfactual question: **[Could Europeans
develop an autonomous defense capacity if there were]{.underline}** a
complete **[U.S. withdrawal from Europe]{.underline}**? Although a U.S.
withdrawal from Europe is unlikely in the short term, it is hardly a
far-fetched scenario for the longer term. Examining this counterfactual
is useful for two key reasons. First, a complete U.S. withdrawal---one
entailing an exit from NATO and the withdrawal of all U.S. conventional
and nuclear forces from the continent---is the strongest possible
incentive that could drive the Europeans to pursue strategic autonomy,
and is therefore the best way to assess their capacity to do so. Second,
examination of this counterfactual advances the U.S. grand strategy
debate in light of the prominent theoretical argument from U.S.
"restraint" scholars such as Barry Posen, who argue that a U.S.
withdrawal is warranted on the grounds that Europe can quickly and
easily create an effective deterrent to Russia.9 As we explain, Europe
is the key fulcrum in the grand strategy debate between these restraint
scholars and "deep engagement" scholars, who favor maintaining current
U.S. security commitments in Europe and elsewhere.10

Determining whether Europeans could achieve strategic autonomy anytime
soon if the United States were to pull back from Europe requires an
examination of the historical trajectory and the current and likely
future state of European interests and defense capacity. Although
existing studies have analyzed important elements of each, a more
systematic analysis is needed.11 Regarding interests, this article
provides the most comprehensive and thorough coding of national threat
perceptions across all of Europe, showing where each country falls
across a set of defined categories of threat prioritization. Concerning
defense capacity, it adds to existing understandings of Europe's
deficiency by providing novel longitudinal data on European conventional
defense capabilities over the past three decades and by outlining a
series of four interwoven challenges that would greatly complicate the
pursuit of strategic autonomy.

Our analysis shows that [**European efforts to achieve strategic
autonomy will be hampered by** two major **constraints: profound defense
capacity shortfalls** that will be hard to close, **and** "strategic
cacophony," that is, **profound, continent-wide divergences across all
the domains of national defense policies,**]{.underline} most notably
threat perceptions.12 These mutually reinforcing constraints impose a
rigid limit on the capacity of Europeans to achieve strategic autonomy
anytime soon. Consequently, **[if the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[were to withdraw]{.underline}** fully,
[**the continent would become significantly more vulnerable to Russian**
meddling and **aggression**]{.underline}. Furthermore, **[if the
U.S.-backed NATO were to disappear, this would undermine the only
institutional framework that has fostered some degree of coordination in
Europe]{.underline}** (at the strategic, doctrinal, and capability
levels) and partly contained Europe's strategic cacophony.
**[This]{.underline}**, in turn, **[would make]{.underline}**
institutionalized, intra-**[European defense cooperation appreciably
harder]{.underline}**.

Ultimately, we conclude that **[the notion that Europeans would be able
to achieve defense autonomy following a U.S. pullback is
illusory.]{.underline}**13 And if even the major shock of a complete
U.S. pullback would be very unlikely to move Europe away from its
current strategic cacophony and capability shortfalls, a partial U.S.
pullback---a much more likely counterfactual---would be more unlikely to
do so. The policy implication is straightforward: if the United States
wants European stability, it needs to stay in Europe.

European Defense Capacity Shortfall

European national assessments thus diverge profoundly regarding the
prioritization among different threats. Significantly, Europe's
strategic cacophony greatly exacerbates a second overarching
**[constraint on Europe achieving strategic autonomy: severe military
capacity gaps that cannot be closed anytime soon.]{.underline}** Since
the end of the Cold War, Europe's defense capacity has markedly
decreased.88 Operationally, the 2011 European military action in Libya
revealed a severe shortage of key enablers for offensive military
operations: the United States had to provide critical capabilities that
the Europeans otherwise lacked, such as air-to-air refueling;
suppression of enemy air defenses; and intelligence, target acquisition,
and reconnaissance.89 Indeed, a recent systematic study by the
International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and the German
Council on Foreign Relations found that, **[because their capability
shortfalls are so significant, Europeans would struggle to autonomously
undertake operations even at the low end of the spectrum of
conflict]{.underline}** (such as peace enforcement missions).90

Lt. Gen. Olivier Rittimann told Anadolu Agency in an interview that
Ukraine was a partner of NATO and so there is a difference between a
partner and an ally.

\"[Cohesion of NATO has been even reinforced by what]{.underline}

\"In fact, if the recent events had not happened, we would have gone to

\"So what [[it proves]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[that]{.mark} \... [if

said.]{.underline}

Rittimann said [the common response by every NATO member, every ally was
to reject \"this Russian invasion of Ukraine.\"]{.underline}

\"I think that enlargement is something that needs to be decided first
by NATO if they are accepting somebody to become a member and then by
the nation which is interested in becoming a NATO member it is
definitely not Russia nor China nor any others who has to decide whether
Ukraine can become a NATO member or not.

\"It is something that has to be discussed between the thirty members of

substantially contribute to deterring further Russian aggression.

[Finland has a massive artillery force of 1,500 cannons along with F-18
fighter jets, multiple launch rocket systems, armored howitzers, a
variety of precision-guided munitions and other high-tech
systems.]{.underline} [Helsinki]{.underline} is increasing its defense
spending and [recently finalized a deal to buy 64 F-35
fighters.]{.underline} Its active duty military is small (only 22,000
personnel), but it [maintains conscription and can quickly
mobilize 280,000 troops --- a far larger force than what Russia sent
into Ukraine.]{.underline}

The Kremlin made all sorts of threats to dissuade Finland from joining
NATO, but the Finns aren't deterred. They remember the heavy losses they
inflicted on Russian invaders in the 1939-1940 Winter War and are not
impressed by the poor performance of the Russian military in Ukraine.
Finland was even prepared for a cut off of Russian electricity that
began on Saturday. Seeing that his bluster wasn't working, Russian
dictator Vladimir Putin was already backing away from his threats on
Monday.

[Sweden has roughly twice Finland's population and a larger defense
budget]{.underline} but a smaller military, with an active-duty force of
24,000 and only 31,800 reserves. But [Stockholm is also increasing
defense spending and expanding its armed forces. Its air force has
ordered 204]{.underline} of the domestically produced,
[top-of-the-line JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft.]{.underline} [Sweden
also manufactures quiet diesel submarines, and its navy plans to
increase its submarine fleet]{.underline} from four to five while also
buying new corvettes.

Sweden's most important asset may be the island of Gotland, an
unsinkable aircraft carrier in the middle of the Baltic Sea. With
Gotland as a NATO base, the Baltic can become a NATO lake, just as
British control of Malta turned the Mediterranean into an Allied lake in
World War II. NATO planners have long feared that, in a war, it would be
hard to resupply Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania because of all the
weapons systems that Moscow has stockpiled in Kaliningrad, a Russian
enclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania. [Having Sweden and Finland
in the alliance is a game changer and tilts the Northern battlefield in
NATO's favor.]{.underline}

NATO should continue to bolster front-line states with permanent, rather
than rotational, troop deployments. The Baltic republics are
particularly vulnerable because they are adjacent to Russia and have
their own populations of Russian speakers, whose presence gives Putin a
built-in excuse for aggression.

Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings
Institution argues that the United States should bolster its presence in
the Baltics: "Something in the range of 10,000 American troops in the
Baltic region --- a brigade combat team (some 4,000 soldiers, plus
support), an Army combat aviation brigade, and two to three squadrons of
Air Force tactical aircraft --- likely would be sufficient." That
commitment would be sufficiently small to not interfere with the
imperative to deter China but large enough to substantially bolster the
defense of these small democracies.

[The supreme irony, of course, is that [Putin]{.mark} [justified his
attack on Ukraine by claiming that Russia could not have another NATO
state]{.mark} on its border --- even though Ukraine was not going to be
admitted to the alliance. [Now Russia's border with NATO will
triple]{.mark}, from 316 to 952 miles.]{.underline}
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} has no one but himself to blame.

Good going, Vlad. Thank you for [[strengthening
NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} If only the price, measured in Ukrainian pain
and suffering, weren't so high.

#### Russia renews NATO's purpose -- overcomes friction over democracy and unites the alliance

The [talks allowed Mr. Putin to revisit Russian grievances over how the
Cold War ended, in hopes of placing them back on the table for
renegotiation]{.underline} 30 years later. His deputy foreign minister,
Aleksandr V. Grushko, even warned the alliance off a "policy of
containment" of Russia and insisted that "free choice does not exist in
international relations" --- suggesting that Ukraine would have to bow
to Russian wishes.

But [the more the discussion evoked the Cold War --- with its firm
dividing line through Europe, and its competing Russian and Western
systems and spheres of influence --- the more it reminded European and
American allies of NATO's purpose.]{.underline}

"[[Deterring Russia]{.mark} [is]{.mark} in [the DNA of NATO]{.mark},
because [Russia]{.mark} is what [can bring]{.mark} [existential threats
to European nations]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Anna Wieslander, chair
of Sweden's Institute for Security and Development.

[That threat now is more than territorial]{.underline}, she said.
[[Russia]{.mark} [is]{.mark} also [trying]{.mark} [to undermine NATO's
democratic cohesion]{.mark}. "Russia is targeting our elections, our
social media, our parliaments and our citizens, and it is become more
obvious now that Russia is not part of our value system,"]{.underline}
Ms. Wieslander said.

As it drafts a new strategic concept to be ready this year,
[[NATO]{.mark} [is concentrating on "resilience]{.mark}"
[against]{.mark} new [hybrid]{.mark} [and cyberthreats]{.mark},
highlighting its defense of the democratic institutions of member
states, not just their territory.]{.underline}

"[NATO is its member states, and it's what allies make of
it]{.underline}," said Sophia Besch, a defense analyst in Berlin for the
Center for European Reform. "It's not out of business because we didn't
let it, and we've changed its raison d'être to what are the major
strategic concerns of the day."

T[he old joke was that if NATO is the answer, what is the
question?]{.underline} Ms. Besch responded: "[We've changed the question
over the years to make NATO the answer. And now we're back at the old
question again, where NATO is more comfortable."]{.underline}

[[NATO]{.mark} [is especially important]{.mark} now
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} those [states bordering Russia, like the
Baltic nations and Poland, a country which has had [deepening strains
with its European
partners](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/world/europe/eu-poland-rule-of-law.html)]{.underline} [over
the protection of core democratic principles]{.underline}, which
Brussels has accused the government in Warsaw of eroding.

But [[the current crisis is a reminder]{.mark}, even in Poland, [of the
importance of the alliance]{.mark} as a whole]{.underline}, and [not
just the country's bilateral relationship with the United
States]{.underline}, said Piotr Buras, head of the Warsaw office of the
European Council on Foreign Relations. [Ukraine has proved especially
vulnerable to Russian threats perhaps precisely because it is not a NATO
member.]{.underline}

"[In Poland there was concern that [NATO]{.mark} would lose its focus on
Russian security threats, but now it's obvious that this [is]{.mark}
[the only framework that can]{.mark} protect us and
[provide]{.mark}]{.underline} long-term
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}," Mr. Buras said.

[There was also anxiety that President Biden, in trying to stabilize
relations with Russia to [pivot toward
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/world/europe/biden-china-europe-submarine-deal.html),
would bargain away forward-based NATO troops in Poland and the
Baltics]{.underline} that were deployed after 2014.

"But [there is no sign that the United States will give in on
fundamental issues to NATO]{.underline}," like its open-door policy and
its right to deploy forces in any member state, Mr. Buras said, and
[Washington has been rigorous in briefing its allies about all of its
discussions with Russia.]{.underline}

Still, he said, the current crisis "is a very clear consequence of the
U.S. pivot to Asia and the realization of Russia that it might now take
advantage of that reorientation of U.S. fundamental security interests,"
he said. "And that issue will not go away soon."

Russia will continue to press for a new security framework in Europe,
and [Europe without the United States is not prepared to play any
significant role, he said, so]{.underline} "for Poland, [NATO is the key
and irreplaceable element."]{.underline}

[Even as Poland's battle with the European Union over the rule of
law]{.underline} still festers, [it]{.underline} [is not an overt issue
in the military alliance of NATO]{.underline}. But it was very
noticeable that as the crisis over Ukraine mounted, President Andrzej
Duda of Poland chose to veto a law, criticized by Washington, which
would have stripped majority ownership of an independent television
station from an American company.

As the security situation in Central Europe has worsened with Russian
aggression and threats, Poland "got what we finally wanted when we
joined NATO, which is allied and American troop presence on our soil ---
to finally bring NATO deployments beyond Germany," said Michal
Baranowski, who heads the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund.

That is precisely one of Russia's current demands --- that those
deployments in Poland and the Baltic States be removed, a demand
rejected by Mr. Biden and by NATO, to Poland's relief.

Still, Mr. Baranowski said, the Russians have mobilized the largest
military force in Europe since 1989, "and that's scary." The alliance,
he said, "is closer to military confrontation, but at least we have not
folded."

But [the crisis has also highlighted the continuing dependence of NATO
on Washington.]{.underline} For Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to
NATO, [what is striking is how much "this is the old NATO, where the
U.S. is the glue, linchpin and indispensable leader of the alliance,"
bringing allies together, informing them and "putting on the table the
strategy we will pursue."]{.underline}

What is extraordinary, he said, is that [more than 70 years after the
alliance was founded, "there appears to be no independent European
strategy or even a European point of view]{.underline} different from
what Washington brought to the table." [[NATO]{.mark} has
[divisions]{.mark}, of course, Mr. Daalder said. "But all the divisions
[are dissolved]{.mark}, at least [for today]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Whether that unity will last should Mr. Putin move farther into Ukraine
is yet to be seen, said Kadri Liik, an analyst with the European Council
on Foreign Relations in Berlin. She sees an unwillingness in Europe to
understand that the world is shifting.

"The wider public is not prepared for any change in the arrangements
we've lived with for the past 30 years," she said. "People think we can
still sanction Russia into obeying the European security order, and that
all it takes is Western unity and principles."

But the United States is leading the world differently, Ms. Liik said.
"I'm just not sure we can expect to continue to live in the world that
corresponds to rules and norms and expect America to enforce them."

That applies to Russia and Europe, too, she said. "We're slowly headed
back to a world" of confrontation between systems with different views
about obeying the rules and the use of power and force.

Ms. Kendall-Taylor believes that Mr. [Putin saw an opportunity to take
advantage of a shakier trans-Atlantic alliance, a divided Europe and a
polarized America]{.underline} with a weakened president.

[NATO unity is real]{.underline} but untested, she said. "It's too early
to declare all restored, because Russia not done anything yet," Ms.
Kendall-Taylor said. "It's a bit the calm before the storm."
