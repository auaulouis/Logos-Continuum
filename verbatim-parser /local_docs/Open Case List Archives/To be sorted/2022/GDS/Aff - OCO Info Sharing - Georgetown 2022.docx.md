# OCO Info-Sharing Aff-Neg\-\--GDS 2022

### Notes

#### What does the aff do/How does it work?

#### Currently NATO because of their defensive nature has determined that offensive cyber operations cannot be developed or deployed by NATO itself. Instead, they have adopted a policy where NATO will coordinate cyber effects from the individual members in NATO. I.e. think like how NATO doesn't have an actual standing army, but uses forces from each individual country and coordinates them underneath the NATO flag. The main problem with this is approach is that while most states are willing to voluntarily lend their cyber capabilities/effects to NATO, the framework does not require states disclose the actual capabilities or other information regarding states offensive cyber operations. The plan would have the United States disclose information regarding their offensive cyber operations and their actual capabilities.

#### What are the aff advantages?

#### First is that disclosing information regarding the United States actual capabilities allows NATO generals to better plan around those capabilities. Under the current policy NATO generals can only request an effect take place without actually knowing whether the individual member states can produce that effect. This leaves NATO generals effectively "flying blindly", which undermines cyber deterrence. 

#### Second is that the current policy risks undermining the cohesion of the alliance. First is that the unwillingness of the United States to disclose what their capabilities are or lend useful information to allies regarding their OCO's hurts their trust. Second is that because the United States doesn't need to disclose information regarding their OCO's, they are/will continue to hack into allies' networks to disrupt adversaries' cyber actions. This intrusion into allied networks also undermines trust and willingness to cooperate inside the alliance.

#### What are the neg controversies?

#### First is that there is a large debate ongoing inside the literature as to whether offensive cyber operations are good and whether they produce deterrence or instead provoke other countries into war. 

#### Second is there are several authors who disagree about whether information sharing will increase trust. This is because the United States often spies on our allies and forcing information sharing will mean that we must tell our allies about the illegal actions we are currently undertaking. (What NATO allies don't know can't hurt them). These authors also believe that information sharing will disrupt the alliance as it means that our data and intel is more likely to be stollen as a result of hack on weaker allies with less cyber capabilities.

Independent Assets, Coordinated Action It's crucial to understand that
[NATO doesn't have its own combat units]{.underline} in any domain. [It
pulls together assets provided by]{.underline} its 29
**[members]{.underline}**. "It's the nations who actually [provide the
forces](https://breakingdefense.com/2017/11/they-will-fight-nato-readies-forces-vs-russia/),
through the NATO force structure," Col. Lewis emphasized. "They bring
their ships, their planes, their tanks.... Those [sovereign capabilities
are exactly that: **sovereign**]{.underline}." "They're responsible for
defending those things," including in cyberspace, Lewis continued. "It's
out job to make sure we have situational awareness of how they're
defending those things and how their success may or may not have an
impact on the overall operation." In cyberspace as on land, air, or sea,
[NATO member nations can act either collectively, through the alliance,
or individually]{.underline}, as sovereign states. But acting outside
alliance channels doesn't bar them from coordinating with each other:
Contrast the war in
[Afghanistan](https://breakingdefense.com/2018/05/the-great-afghan-paradox-were-not-winning-but-that-doesnt-mean-we-should-leave/),
which was long run as a [NATO
operation](https://www.nato.int/cps/em/natohq/topics_8189.htm), and the
war in [Iraq](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/iraq/), waged by a
"coalition of the willing" outside the alliance but involving multiple
nations that happened to be NATO members. A NATO member can even divorce
itself from the alliance's military structure but still participate in
NATO operations, as [France](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/france/)
did from [1966 to
2008](https://otan.delegfrance.org/France-and-NATO-presentation-1217).
So while [NATO, by charter, **renounces offensive operations**, its
members can still conduct them]{.underline} --- on their own legal
authority as sovereign states, but, if they wish, [in **coordination**
with each other and in **consultation with NATO**]{.underline}**.** With
that in mind, here's a more formal and precise description, which I
drafted but which NATO officials read, revised and agreed is accurate:
"In all domains --- land, air, maritime, and (as of 2016) cyber --- NATO
relies on forces contributed by its member nations to conduct military
operations. "In all domains, NATO operations are governed by the
consensus of all 29 member states, executed by SACEUR and subordinate
commanders in accordance with the constraints of the approved operation.
"In all domains, if a NATO member state decides to conduct an operation
using its own forces and its own legal authorities, it may choose to
inform NATO command structures and coordinate with NATO plans and
operations. "How this applies in the cyber domain specifically: NATO
policy, as set by the consensus of the 29 members, is that the alliance
itself, in keeping with its defensive mindset, shall not conduct
offensive cyber operations. However, [this does not
restrict]{.underline} unilateral or **[multilateral offensive operations
by NATO member states]{.underline}**. NATO policy --- again, by member
consensus --- does provide for the integration of sovereign cyberspace
effects provided by Allies with the ability and willingness to provide
them. That integration into Allied operations and missions will be
orchestrated by the NATO CYOC (Cyber Operations Centre)." As I interpret
this, [a NATO commander, acting in]{.underline} his or her **[alliance
capacity]{.underline}**, couldn't order anyone to conduct an offensive
cyber operation. But the same commander [could suggest an offensive
cyber operation]{.underline}, and one or more of the member states could
then voluntarily conduct it. Or a commander with a dual NATO and
national role could simply take off his NATO hat and use the authority
granted him by his own nation to order his own nation's forces to
conduct a cyber attack. The obvious candidate here is [Gen.
Scaparrotti](https://breakingdefense.com/2016/03/gen-scaparrotti-to-move-from-korea-to-europe-low-key-4-star/),
who is both NATO's [Supreme Allied Commander
Europe](https://shape.nato.int/saceur-2) (SACEUR) and
[Commander](http://www.eucom.mil/commander), US European Command
(EUCOM). In either case, [the national forces conducting the attack can
coordinate with other alliance members, through NATO]{.underline}
organizations[, to "**integrate" the attack with the alliance's
collective defense operations**]{.underline}. For cyberspace
specifically, [this coordination and integration role is]{.underline}
played by the new Cyber Operations Center. It's as [a logical extension
of CYOC's "situational awareness" mission]{.underline} to share
information among the member states about what each of them is observing
and doing in cyberspace. ["NATO doesn't do offense, but it will
integrate **sovereign effects** from the nations that are **capable and
willing to provide them**]{.underline}," Lewis said. "Some [nations have
stated their willingness to [provide those
effects](https://breakingdefense.com/tag/cyber-warfare/)]{.underline}.
The role of the CYOC is simply to integrate it into the operations in
the same way we integrate all the other arrows in the quiver."

#### The US contributes to NATO's cyber capabilities now, but that's worthless without increased info sharing -- US cooperation is key.

Life for NATO's Cyber Policy,\" GMFUS,
https://www.gmfus.org/news/offense-new-defense-new-life-natos-cyber-policy\]

Deter, then Defend?

[NATO's defenses are only as strong as the sum of those of its
members]{.underline}. Like in other domains, [alliance cyber assets are
not NATO-owned but provided by member states]{.underline}.\[19\] **[U.S.
capabilities in the cyber domain are by far the most sophisticated among
the allies]{.underline}**. Besides having an edge over most competitors
in the field of cyber security,\[20\] [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [tops rankings as a global leader in **offensive
cyber capabilities**]{.underline}.\[21\] The [recent announcement that
it would contribute its capabilities to NATO]{.underline} operations
consequently could [help the alliance bolster its deterrence
posture]{.underline} against hostile cyber-attacks.

Until recently, NATO and member states, including the United States,
have relied on strictly defensive cyber tools to protect their
infrastructure. However, given that this approach has done little to
discourage hostile actors, the strategic value of incorporating
offensive cyber operations has long been discussed. In late 2017,
Stoltenberg announced that NATO would integrate cyber weapons of its
members into military operations to deter and defend against threats,
marking the "biggest overall policy shift in decades," according to
officials.\[22\]

The U.S. decision to commit offensive and defensive capabilities to NATO
follows on the heels of this move. [The addition of offensive cyber
tools to the defense and deterrence toolbox]{.underline} is not only new
for NATO, it also [tracks a recent shift in the U.S.
posture]{.underline}. [The White House authorized the use of offensive
cyber weapons to deter foreign adversaries]{.underline} in September
with the publication of the Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber
Strategy.\[23\] The strategy also incorporates a new mission of
"defending forward" as a means to "disrupt or halt malicious cyber
activity at its source, including activity that falls below the level of
armed conflict."\[24\] While defending forward is, as the name suggests,
defensive in nature, it entails targeting foreign cyberspace
infrastructure to pre-empt incoming attacks through offensive cyber
operations.

\"This shift from reactive to preemptive action in cyberspace marks the
most significant departure from the previous U.S. cyber strategy."

[This shift from reactive to preemptive action in
cyberspace]{.underline} marks the most significant departure from the
previous U.S. cyber strategy, published in 2015, and [comes in response
to persistent cyber campaigns against the United States directed by
Russia and China]{.underline}. Taken individually, these offenses may
fall short of provoking an official response, but their cumulative
impact over time is a significant concern and needs to be addressed.
[The new forward-leaning posture of the United States]{.underline} seeks
to [address this threat]{.underline} preemptively [without risking an
escalation to conventional military uses of force]{.underline}.\[25\]

[Superior cyber capabilities]{.underline} will not be a deterrent per
se, but they [can add to NATO's resilience against
threats]{.underline}.\[26\] Aggressive cyber operations have already
become an important element in the hybrid warfare tool kit of many
adversaries. Adding offensive cyber capabilities will likely not stop
this. That is why it is critical that deterrence against cyber threats
not only relies on cyber operations, but also draws on the full spectrum
of conventional and unconventional responses, as outlined in the 2018
Brussels summit declaration.\[27\]

Defensive and [offensive cyber capabilities can reinforce NATO members'
ability to deter and deny cyber-attacks by disincentivizing other actors
from developing cyber weapons]{.underline} in the first place, [and by
convincing those with]{.underline} or without [offensive cyber
capabilities that attacks will]{.underline} be largely ineffective or
[come at an equal or greater cost to them]{.underline}. [Proactive cyber
defense also can help to anticipate and prevent an attack on computers
and networks]{.underline}, [which requires active monitoring of hostile
actors]{.underline}. This is where offensive cyber operations provide
the most strategic value. For instance, they could interfere directly
with operations of adversaries by manipulating their devices and
infrastructure through malware, or by shutting off power and networks
from which an attack originates. **[They can]{.underline}** also
**[affect the calculations of hostile actors who may judge that the
potential cost of an attack outweighs its strategic
gains]{.underline}**.

\"Countering cyber threats with offensive operations could have a
cascading effect that eventually precipitates conventional conflict.\"

On the other hand, countering cyber threats with offensive operations
could have a cascading effect that eventually precipitates conventional
conflict.\[28\] A more assertive U.S. posture on cyber could thus
potentially heighten the risk of an unanticipated crisis in the cyber
and conventional domains. This could have serious implications for other
NATO allies that might be pulled into a conflict, especially if the
lines between NATO and U.S. cyber operations are blurred, based on
Mattis\' recent statement.

Challenges Remain

While there are still many unknowns in NATO's cyber policy, [the United
States' announcement did clarify how its capabilities would be used in
the event of a joint NATO cyber operation]{.underline}. As indicated by
the Pentagon, [the United States would maintain control over its own
personnel and capabilities]{.underline}. This is by no means unusual and
not necessarily a surprise. As in most areas, NATO does not rely on
commonly owned assets for cyber defense but on national
capabilities.\[29\] Similarly, NATO members retain command and control
of cyber operations they provide. However, as the former team leader of
NATO's Task Force Cyber (CISO), Col. Rizwan Ali, has pointed out, [this
poses a **significant challenge** to NATO commanders who **may not have
access to**]{.underline} many **[critical details implicating their
decision-making process]{.underline}**. In effect, Ali explained,
[commanders]{.underline} "[will request an effect using cyber weaponry
during an operation and]{.underline} one of the [allies will provide
that effect without any further information]{.underline}."\[30\] [As a
result]{.underline}, **[NATO commanders will be flying
blind]{.underline}**, [lacking many important details regarding
limitations of capabilities and potential conflicts with other ongoing
operations]{.underline}.

Related to this challenge, NATO's **[constraints on information sharing
could hurt strategic decision-making processes and cyber
operations]{.underline}**. [While]{.underline} most experts acknowledge
that [intelligence capabilities within NATO are
significant]{.underline}, [these remain isolated and
well-guarded]{.underline} by national intelligence communities.\[31\]
**[More advanced information sharing]{.underline}**, among allies and
with other partners such as the EU, **[is critical for situational
awareness and NATO's preparedness]{.underline}**. Yet, due mostly to a
lack of trust between allies, [**this process is far from** being at an
**optimal** level]{.underline}.\[32\]

When it comes to intelligence sharing, some allies fear that
infiltration and attacks against countries with lower resilience could
potentially compromise information shared by other member states.
**[Pushback against greater transparency is especially strong on the
part of the United States]{.underline}**, [which owns a large share of
NATO's intelligence capabilities]{.underline}, [making it a **critical
player** in alliance intelligence operations from a tactical as well as
strategic perspective]{.underline}.\[33\] Due to the country's outsized
role in this field, NATO's intelligence adaptation is largely dependent
on U.S. inclinations to share capabilities and information with other
allies.\[34\] Although efforts to protect intelligence by minimizing
sharing may be justified, [elevating the role of the United States in
NATO's cyber policy without increasing transparency]{.underline} could
potentially [limit tactical effectiveness]{.underline}.

#### US-NATO info sharing is key to set global cyber norms and prevent miscalc.

[As a response to grey zone conflict and offence dominance in
cyberspace]{.underline}, many national governments, such as [the United
States]{.underline}, Germany and Canada, have [concluded that a static
defence is no longer adequate]{.underline} and have been [adjusting to
allow pre-emptive cyber operations intended to disrupt hostile actors
before they can act]{.underline} (Herpig 2018; Nakashima 2018; Grigsby
2017). [Organizations]{.underline} at the international level have
[mirrored this trend]{.underline}. In 2017, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) [adjusted its policy away from
ambiguity on cyber effects to a more responsive stance]{.underline},
establishing a Cyber Operations Centre to integrate the cyber
capabilities of its members into military operations (Ricks and Ali
2017). While this may be necessary to cope with the attribution problem
and grey zone hostilities, **[whether or not this will re-enable
effective deterrence]{.underline}** or cause further destabilization
through tit-for-tat escalation **[remains unclear]{.underline}**.

Due to many of its members being on the receiving end of grey zone cyber
attacks, [**NATO has been a leading light** in trying to resolve the
current uncertainty plaguing international governance of cyber
conflict]{.underline}. It has attempted, through efforts such as the
establishment of the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence and
publication of the Tallinn Manual, to arrive at a clear interpretation
of which acts in cyberspace are permissible or not under current
international law (Arts 2018). [The alliance relies on all members
following through on their commitment to collective defence as
stipulated under article 5 of the alliance's treaty]{.underline}. This
makes the attribution challenge in cyberwarfare especially problematic,
as it can give members a plausible reason to demur on this potentially
costly commitment. [This is forcing NATO to consider what kind of
activity in cyberspace would be serious enough to invoke the collective
defence clause]{.underline}. While NATO has affirmed that article 5
could be triggered by a significant cyber attack, as of yet it has not
determined a precise threshold (ibid.).

Implications and Policy Consequences

[**Global strategic stability** is undermined by the failure of states
to take seriously the erosion of defence capabilities]{.underline}
caused by growing reliance on ICT technologies in critical
infrastructures and weapon systems. At present, COTS and [the ICT supply
chain that services critical infrastructure present a]{.underline}
particularly [vulnerable point of entry for malicious
actors]{.underline}. Existing governance and oversight mechanisms
concerning the deployment of ICT will prove too lenient for the
developing threat environment. Enhanced communication and tighter
cooperation between government and the private sector will prove crucial
to bolstering defences in this area. More arrangements like the
Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, which facilitate intelligence
sharing on cyber threats between the public and private sector, would be
of great benefit (Lord and Mussington 2017).

**[Superior coordination and information sharing are]{.underline}** also
**[required at the international level]{.underline}**. [In the face of
an offence-dominant environment]{.underline}, [efforts must be taken to
assuage the uncertainties felt by various actors as to each other's
capabilities and intentions]{.underline}. The technical and political
difficulties in attributing cyber attacks, combined with their
affordability, will continue to encourage attackers. [Those defending
against cyber attacks must]{.underline} therefore [take a
firmer]{.underline}, [less equivocal stance than they have so far
displayed]{.underline}. Absent an international consensus on what
constitutes use of force in cyberspace, **[the United States
and]{.underline}** fellow **[NATO]{.underline}** members
[must]{.underline} collectively decide upon a clear code of conduct for
[respond]{.underline}ing [to grey zone activities]{.underline}, [in
order to banish]{.underline} ambiguity and [the risk of
miscalculation]{.underline}. A red line should be drawn around the most
pernicious types of cyber hostilities now being perpetrated, such as
attempts to sway foreign elections, the violation of which should
trigger a measured yet firm response. [Restoring clarity]{.underline} to
the "action-reaction" dynamic [is necessary both to dissuade hostile
actors by guaranteeing reprisal for certain offences]{.underline}, [and
to solidify an understanding among allies as to when they must come to
one another's assistance]{.underline}. In the long term, the United
States and its allies should promote more effective international
governance by pushing to have these red lines enshrined as international
norms in fora such as the United Nations. **[There is an urgency to this
effort]{.underline}** --- [failure to do so will only entrench the idea
that]{.underline} the constant [grey zone hostilities we are now
witnessing have become a tolerable part of international
behaviour]{.underline}

#### Specifically, info-sharing is key to integrate US capabilities below the level of warfare -- that solves Russian gray-zone aggression.

**[NATO members are in the midst of a crisis]{.underline}**. With Russia
massing troops along its border with Ukraine and moving additional
forces to Belarus ostensibly to conduct joint military exercises,
policymakers fear that Russia is on the precipice of invading Ukraine
and taking additional territory by force---similar to Russia's
annexation of Crimea in 2014. But, even if Russian President Vladimir
Putin ultimately chooses not to launch a direct, conventional invasion
of Ukraine, it is highly likely that he will continue to pursue Russian
strategic objectives in the gray zone short of war. [The crisis over
Ukraine underscores]{.underline} the [challenges NATO faces in competing
with Russia in the gray zone]{.underline}---especially [in
cyberspace]{.underline}.

[Russia has no]{.underline} such [limitations in the gray
zone]{.underline}. In addition to traditional forms of irregular
warfare, such as the use of plausibly deniable proxy forces (Putin's
"little green men"), [Russia has long relied on cyber operations to
subvert and undermine rival governments while avoiding actions that
would]{.underline} cross a threshold [prompt]{.underline}ing an
overwhelming [retaliation]{.underline}. Indeed, in tandem with Russia's
conventional military buildup, Ukrainian government agencies were struck
with a spate of website defacements. Microsoft also revealed that it had
discovered destructive malware in some Ukrainian government systems,
which Ukrainian officials have linked to the Belarusian group
GhostWriter. Belarus has close ties to Russia, and observers have
speculated that Belarus may have been operating in cyberspace on
Russia's behalf.

While Ukraine is not a NATO member, [the current situation underscores
the enduring strategic challenge the alliance faces in addressing the
cyber threat posed by Russia]{.underline} and other actors. In
particular, because **[cost imposition is an integral part of any
deterrence strategy]{.underline}** (and has been part of NATO's
conventional deterrence strategy), [the alliance has begun to explore
how it could incorporate offensive cyber operations as]{.underline} a
component of its [cyber deterrence]{.underline} posture. But, while NATO
took important steps to address cyber defense, it took nearly a decade
after Russia's 2007 cyberattack against Estonia to begin to seriously
address the issue of offensive cyber operations. Moreover, [NATO cyber
policy has traditionally focused on cyber operations in a warfighting
context]{.underline}---[a focus that comes at the expense of considering
cyber operations below the level of warfare]{.underline}. As the recent
cyberattacks against Ukraine illustrate, [**the gray zone** just beneath
the threshold of armed conflict **is where NATO faces its most
significant cyber threats**]{.underline}. With NATO in the middle of
conducting a comprehensive initiative, NATO 2030, to strengthen the
alliance, it should incorporate an assessment of the role of cyber
operations in routine competition.

Offensive Cyber Operations in NATO Strategy Above and Below the Level of
Warfare

Historically, [NATO's cyber posture has largely focused on defense and
resilience]{.underline}---and this continues to form the bulk of NATO's
approach. The alliance maintains that its "main focus in cyber defence
is to protect its own networks (including operations and missions) and
enhance resilience." At the 2014 Wales summit, NATO endorsed the
Enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, which affirmed that cyber defense is part
of collective defense and that the alliance would incorporate cyber
defense into its planning and operations. In 2016, NATO members pledged
to improve their cyber defenses through training, education, exercises,
and information sharing.

But the [seeds were also planted]{.underline} in 2016 [for NATO to
consider a potential role for offensive cyber operations]{.underline}.
That year, the alliance recognized cyberspace as a domain of military
operations, comparable to land, sea, and air. At the 2018 Brussels
summit, [NATO began to more seriously consider offensive cyber
operations]{.underline}. Specifically, NATO created the Cyberspace
Operations Centre to coordinate requests for member states to provide
offensive cyber effects through the Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided
Voluntarily by Allies process. Following the 2018 summit, then-Secretary
of Defense James Mattis stated in a press conference that five
states---the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, the
Netherlands, and Estonia---were contributing cyber forces to "help NATO
fight in this important domain." More recently, in June 2021,
[NATO]{.underline} convened in Brussels and [committed to a
Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy]{.underline}. [A key feature of the
new policy is the prominent role of offensive cyber
operations]{.underline}. In Brussels, member states committed to "employ
the full range of capabilities at all times to actively deter, defend
against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats."

[NATO's shift to]{.underline} incorporating [offensive cyber
operations]{.underline} into existing strategy and policy [has focused
on integrating offensive effects]{.underline} into conventional military
plans and operations **[in the context of a conflict]{.underline}**.
[While NATO's updated strategy is a positive development]{.underline},
[**its limited focus** on conflict scenarios for employing cyber power
**fails to accurately account for the cyber threat environment NATO
faces**]{.underline}---particularly the [mismatch between the
alliance's]{.underline} clear [distinction between wartime and peacetime
and the approach of]{.underline} adversaries like [Russia]{.underline},
who adopt a competition-conflict continuum. Additionally, [the focus on
employing offensive cyber during a high-end conventional fight
is]{.underline} also [not consistent with how]{.underline} several [NATO
members are already engaged in]{.underline} gray zone [offensive cyber
operations]{.underline}.

The primary threat to NATO allies in the cyber domain is not from
high-end, decisive cyberattacks. Instead, cyber threats more frequently
and effectively manifest as gray zone tactics designed to have a
corrosive effect without rising to the level of warfare. There are
numerous examples of this type of threat. For instance, in July 2021,
NATO publicly condemned a range of malicious cyber behavior, including
the Microsoft Exchange hack (which NATO attributed to China) and
ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure. Russia has
leveraged cyber and disinformation operations to interfere in democratic
elections in the United States in 2016, 2018, and 2020; France in 2017;
and Germany in 2017 and 2021---to name just a few examples. Russia also
conducted distributed denial-of-service cyberattacks against government
websites in Montenegro during the lead-up to, and following,
Montenegro's ascension to NATO in 2017. And when NATO forces were
positioned in the Baltics beginning in 2017 as part of NATO's enhanced
forward presence, two threat actors, GhostWriter and Secondary
Infektion, conducted a range of disinformation campaigns.

Additionally, the reality is that several [NATO members are already
speaking publicly about offensive cyber operations **below the level of
warfare**]{.underline} and [their statements]{.underline} and actions
[have an effect on the entire alliance]{.underline}. In particular, NATO
member nations have not reached a political consensus about the role of
offensive cyber operations. [In 2018]{.underline}, [the US]{.underline}
Department of Defense and US Cyber Command [issued new strategy and
policy documents that articulated a role for the military in conducting
offensive cyber operations below the level of armed
conflict]{.underline} outside of US-controlled cyberspace (part of the
"defend forward" strategy), and [there has been]{.underline} some
[reporting about US offensive cyber operations]{.underline}. For
instance, in 2018 the United States disrupted the Russian-linked
Internet Research Agency from interfering in the midterm elections. And,
more recently, in December 2021 General Paul Nakasone, commander of US
Cyber Command, publicly acknowledged that the military played a role in
disrupting ransomware groups targeting critical infrastructure. [The
United States has]{.underline} also [worked with]{.underline} other
[NATO allies]{.underline}, such as Estonia and Montenegro, [to
conduct]{.underline} "hunt forward" [cyber operations on allied and
partner networks to uncover and disrupt malicious cyber
activity]{.underline}.

Other NATO allies have also been more transparent about offensive cyber
operations. In 2020, the United Kingdom announced a significant
investment in its National Cyber Force, its organizational arm for
offensive cyber operations, and its 2022 National Cyber Strategy
emphasized the role of offensive cyber operations. In November 2021,
General Nakasone and the director of Government Communications
Headquarters---the UK government's principal signals intelligence
agency---stated jointly that the two governments were collaborating to
"impose consequences" in cyberspace to disrupt adversary operations. The
Netherlands has also publicly alluded to conducting offensive cyber
operations.

Next Steps: Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks

[Given the threat environment facing NATO]{.underline}, [as well as the
activities of several NATO members]{.underline}, **[the alliance
should]{.underline}** deliberately---but purposefully---consider
**[incorporat]{.underline}**ing [**o**ffensive **c**yber
**o**peration**s** below the level of armed conflict into its deterrence
strategy]{.underline}. Any effort to explore a role for offensive cyber
operations should also consider the challenges and risks that may come
with doing so. A central challenge is that, at the political level, NATO
allies lack consensus on the appropriate application of offensive cyber
power---especially below the level of armed conflict. Addressing these
disagreements among member states is essential because conducting
**[offensive cyber operations]{.underline}** often **[requires
maneuvering through or operating on networks controlled by an ally or
allies]{.underline}**. [Right now]{.underline}, [NATO members do not
collectively agree on the protocols and processes for partner
actions]{.underline} in allied networks---and they also disagree on how
to define sovereignty in cyberspace, or when an offensive cyber
operation would rise to the level of an armed attack.

Offensive cyber operations for NATO also present real interoperability
challenges. The role of intelligence in cyber operations is likely to
complicate NATO planning processes. Even close **[allies
are]{.underline}** likely to be [**wary about sharing** sensitive
**intelligence**]{.underline} for a number of reasons. For instance,
they may be averse to sharing information gleaned from signals
intelligence collection or because a member state may be using the same
exploits for both offensive action and their own espionage---including
intelligence collection against allies. Or, allies may simply be worried
that sensitive information may become exposed. On top of this, it's
challenging to adjudicate intelligence requirements among allies and to
deconflict intelligence and military priorities. It is also not clear
whether the alliance has established consensus thresholds that specify
the conditions and timeline under which a state would have to notify
others of its activities on their networks---if at all.

[The alliance should]{.underline} account for, and
[address]{.underline}, [these issues as NATO explores]{.underline} the
prospect of incorporating [offensive cyber operations]{.underline} below
the level of armed conflict into existing NATO simulations and exercises
that span the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. A number of
important [questions about how to coordinate offensive cyber
operations]{.underline} and define roles and responsibilities [remain
unanswered]{.underline}. For instance, how could allies improve
intelligence sharing to conduct more rapid attribution, enabling one
state or the alliance to respond to adversary cyber activity? What are
the conditions under which allies should consider dividing
responsibilities for cyber campaign planning and developing accesses and
capabilities against strategic targets in, for example, Russia? [If some
allies are responsible for offensive cyber operations against certain
targets]{.underline}, **[what are the information-sharing and
notification requirements]{.underline}**?

#### Otherwise, Russia will use [cyber]{.underline} and [information attacks]{.underline} to [escalate]{.underline}

[Growing]{.underline} political **[polarization]{.underline}** in the
United States [is a]{.underline} **[vulnerability]{.underline}** that
**[foreign adversaries are exploiting]{.underline}** [--- and experts
worry the trend will **accelerate**. The threat was brought into **sharp
relief**]{.underline} [by]{.underline} the indictment of 13 Russians as
part of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into allegations of
collusion between Moscow and the 2016 Trump campaign. The Russian
efforts, according to the indictment, [were part of a broader effort "to
sow **discord in the U.S. political system**]{.underline}," achieved
mostly [by fanning the flames of **divisive debates**]{.underline}
already raging in the country. There is bipartisan concern that [the
constant tearing of America's political fabric provides an **opening for
Russia**]{.underline}, or **[any]{.underline}** other [**hostile
power**, to **exploit**]{.underline}. ["It's just **so
easy**]{.underline} [in today's polarized environment to **take
advantage** of]{.underline} the **[biases]{.underline}** that people
have, and their addiction to social media, and their seeking out
information that confirms their preconceived views," said former Rep.
Jason Altmire (D-Pa.). Altmire, who served three terms in Congress,
recently authorized a book on political polarization, called \"Dead
Center: How Political Polarization Divided America and What We Can Do
about It.\" Former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a centrist
Republican, expressed a similar view of the threat. ["We can't accept
doing nothing]{.underline} --- just shrugging our shoulders," Whitman
told The Hill. She said there's a need to provide states and localities
with funding and training to help them identify and rebuff efforts to
meddle in elections. But she acknowledged that the broader shift toward
the political extremes would be difficult to counteract, especially when
the media has become so fractured. "There is no Walter Cronkite
anymore," Whitman said, referring to the legendary CBS News anchorman
whose word carried weight with Americans of all political persuasions
during his prime in the 1960s and 1970s. Foreign policy specialists have
also sounded the alarm. In a New York Times op-ed last month, former
President Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice argued that
"[the]{.underline} **[most significant, long-term threat]{.underline}**
to our security [may be]{.underline} our **[domestic]{.underline}**
political **[polarization]{.underline}**." Rice added, ["We need to
decide whether we]{.underline} want to remain the world's pre-eminent
power --- a strong, cohesive beacon of democracy --- or if we [are
content to allow our **national autoimmune disorder**]{.underline},
[like a **flesh-eating disease**, to **devour our body
politic**]{.underline}." Skeptics of the Russia story have noted that
there is nothing particularly new or unusual about attempts by Moscow,
or by other adversaries, to try to affect public opinion in the United
States --- just as Washington has meddled in other nation's affairs for
decades. But experts in the area argue that the difference now is that
the depth of America\'s divide makes such attacks more effective. John
Sipher spent 28 years in the CIA's National Clandestine Service. He told
The Hill that the Kremlin had been seeking to influence American public
opinion "for 70, 80 years." But, he added, two factors make today's
landscape more fertile ground for such efforts. One, he said, was the
way in which "the ability to weaponize information via social media has
changed." In addition he said, "the big problem is us. Our
[hyperpartisanship and our tribal behavior are dry tinder]{.underline}
for the Russians." The recent indictments make clear the extent to which
Russians apparently sought to inflame divisions. Prosecutors allege that
they sought to capitalize on racial and religious tensions, backed
left-wing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as well as President Trump in the
2016 campaign, falsely suggested Hillary Clinton harbored sympathies for
Sharia law, and even promoted competing pro- and anti-Trump rallies
following the 2016 election. [Efforts to **fuel the flames** of American
enmity are allegedly **ongoing**.]{.underline}

[Lawmakers wonder whether NATO is ready to robustly defend against a
cyberattack]{.underline} against one of its own The other battlefield:
[It isn\'t only Russia\'s military might that has some]{.underline} U.S.
[**lawmakers and experts concerned** about what\'s next in the conflict
with Ukraine.]{.underline} They\'re also [worried about a stealthy but
possibly just as damaging enemy: **cyber warfare.** They believe that
as]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin is pressed on the
battlefield and continues to be squeezed by the sharp bite of U.S. and
European sanctions, NATO\'s newly evolved cyber policy might not be
prepared to respond.]{.underline} Over the past decade,
**[NATO]{.underline}** --- like most organizations and entities --- [has
modernized its cyber defensive posture and practices]{.underline},
prompting NATO to say last year that it would "weigh 'on a case-by-case
basis' whether a cyberattack would trigger its Article 5 collective
defense principle, which establishes that an attack against one ally is
an attack against all allies," our colleagues [Cat Zakrzewski and Joseph
Menn reported last
month.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/24/russia-cyberattacks-global/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9)
"We will not speculate on how serious a cyberattack would have to be in
order to trigger a collective response," a NATO official [told reporters
month](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cyberattack-nato-could-trigger-collective-defence-clause-official-2022-02-28/).
"Any response could include diplomatic and economic sanctions, cyber
measures, or even conventional forces, depending on the nature of the
attack," the official added. The updated policy, according to former
U.S. ambassadors to NATO and experts who work closely with the
organization, has come a long way since Russian-based attackers launched
[massive cyberattacks on Estonia](https://www.bbc.com/news/39655415)
over the removal of a Soviet war memorial in the small Baltic country in
2007. As it currently stands, [NATO leaders were **deliberately
ambiguous**]{.underline} in defining what would qualify as an Article 5
attack when revising the group\'s cyber policy, "so as not to create a
clear-cut threshold beneath which an opponent could operate freely,"
said Douglas Lute, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO. But [there is some
concern the ambiguity might muddle a potential response to a
cyberattack]{.underline}. Key quote: "If you have a catastrophic
cyberattack that shuts down your \[power\] grids or shuts down your
ability to keep your people warm in the winter or fed or what have you,
we\'ve got to figure that out. I think [NATO needs to get together and
have those very difficult \[discussions\] because it is a component of
war]{.underline}, as I said before, **[and I think it needs to be viewed
as such]{.underline}**," Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.), the top Republican on
the House Homeland Security panel, told The Washington Post in [an
interview last
week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2022/03/01/117th-congress-rep-john-katko-r-ny/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16).
**["I think it\'s evolving]{.underline}**. Do **[they have more to
go]{.underline}**? Absolutely," Katko added of NATO.

Conflict," *Council on Foreign Relations,* March 8^th^, Available Online

[The large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine now underway could quite
**plausibly precipitate** a wider conflict in Europe]{.underline}. The
United States is focused primarily on raising the costs to Russia with
punishing sanctions and reassuring North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) allies neighboring Russia of its commitment to collective
defense. [Less attention has been given to containing the war to Ukraine
and preventing its escalation into a **broader European
conflict**.]{.underline}

[The stakes are **enormous**]{.underline}. [The ripple effects of a
wider conflict in Europe would spread **across the globe**, stressing
the **geopolitical**, **economic**, and **institutional foundations** of
the **international order**]{.underline} the United States has fashioned
and underwritten since the end of the Second World War. [It would test
the resilience of the U.S. **global system of alliances**, the
international **financial system**, **global energy markets**, **arms
control regimes**, and **global institutions** in the face of ever more
violent **great power competition**]{.underline}. [**No region** of the
world would be spared]{.underline}, although developments on the
Eurasian supercontinent, the other locus of world power and economic
might outside North America, would bear the gravest consequences for
U.S. interests.

The Contingency

[The Russian military intervention in Ukraine could **easily escalate**
into a larger conflict stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea and
further west into Europe]{.underline}. Although Russia, wielding massive
military superiority, might overrun Ukrainian forces in a matter of
weeks, stabilizing and pacifying the country will likely prove to be a
grueling and costly affair. A significant Ukrainian resistance movement
is almost certain to emerge. With sustained Western support, it could
prolong the warfare for months, if not years. The first wave of
sanctions that Washington has levied on Moscow could be followed by
others in a continuing effort to raise the cost to Moscow and force it
to yield. A negotiated end to the conflict will not come easily, since
Washington has framed it in Manichean terms as a world historical
struggle between the democratic West and the aggressive, malevolent, and
autocratic Russia. Anything short of "victory" will be decried as
surrender or appeasement in the West, while Russia will not capitulate
on a matter it considers vital to its security and prosperity.

[The stage is thus set for an **escalating cycle** of violence, with
Moscow seeking to stamp out a Ukrainian insurgency and retaliate against
Western efforts to stop Russia's advance. If the conflict wears on,
Moscow could be **increasingly tempted** to expand its military
operations further into Europe to achieve its goals.]{.underline}

As a first option, [Russia could **intensify pressure** on states
neighboring Ukraine (e.g., Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia) that
could provide safe havens for insurgents or the inevitable
government-in-exile]{.underline}. It will doubtless reinforce its
military presence in Kaliningrad and elsewhere in the Baltics and patrol
the Baltic Sea more aggressively. [It could deploy hybrid-war
tactics---**cyberattacks**, **disinformation campaigns**, and **economic
sabotage**---to destabilize countries providing safe
havens]{.underline}. If those actions did not sufficiently degrade the
resistance, [Moscow could even launch direct attacks on insurgents and
their supporters outside Ukraine, as well as attempt to assassinate
leading figures in the government-in-exile, akin to the attacks it has
made on Chechen rebels and Federal Security Service (FSB) defectors in
Europe in recent years]{.underline}. Such steps could, at a minimum,
draw frontline NATO states directly into the military conflict with
Russia, obligating the United States and other allies to come to their
defense.

To build up further pressure, [Moscow could also "**weaponize**" the
inevitable refugee flows into neighboring states]{.underline}. Refugees,
who would likely number in the millions, would move first into
unoccupied Ukrainian territory but eventually into adjacent European
states, which have shown little tolerance for outsiders. Moscow could
use harsh military and police tactics that would increase the number of
refugees and seek to guide them into countries where they would create
the greatest socioeconomic stress, such as Moldova. In addition, [Moscow
could increase the tension by pushing Belarusian President Aleksandr
Lukashenko to again seek to push thousands of Middle Eastern migrants
across the borders into Poland and Lithuania. That could lead to
**border clashes**, as it almost did on occasion last fall, with Russia
supporting its ally, Belarus, and **NATO states coming** to the defense
of allies under attack.]{.underline}

A second option [Moscow could pursue is opening up a second front in the
**Balkans**.]{.underline} In recent years, Russia has taken a number of
destabilizing actions in the region, seeking to weaken Montenegro after
its accession to NATO, exacerbate tensions between Serbs and Bosniaks in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and undermine relations between Serbia and Kosovo.
As it fought in Ukraine, [Russia could encourage Republika Srpska leader
Milorad Dodik to press for separation from Bosnia, threatening to
reignite the bitter wars of the 1990s in the former
Yugoslavia.]{.underline} A Balkans war would complicate the security
calculus of all countries in the region, as well as that of Germany and
France, which have significant interests there. [To quell the fighting,
NATO countries could decide to use military force against Bosnian Serb
forces enjoying Russian support.]{.underline}

A third, riskier, [option would be to **directly attack** the United
States, the country that Moscow believes is orchestrating a larger
anti-Russia campaign. In response to Western sanctions designed to
crater Russia's financial system and undermine critical industries,
Moscow could launch major cyberattacks against U.S. critical
infrastructure]{.underline}. If a cyberattack were to take down a major
financial institution or corrupt its records, the ensuing havoc in U.S.
markets could prompt overwhelming public and congressional pressure for
a forceful response.

[The U.S. and NATO response to Russian actions will impact Moscow's
decisions on the conduct of the conflict. Both a weak response and an
excessively harsh one could **lead to escalation**]{.underline}. In the
first case, Moscow could be tempted to press militarily even further
into Europe to enlarge its sphere of influence. Vladimir Putin has
demanded that NATO withdraw its forces back to the lines they held in
1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed and the first wave of
post−Cold War expansion remained in the future. His remarks announcing
the start of hostilities against Ukraine hinted at a broader effort to
restore Russia's control over all of the former Soviet Union. [That
could include military action against the Baltic states, especially
Lithuania, through which Moscow could try to carve out a land corridor
to Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea. NATO would have
little choice but to provide military aid to those states if it did not
want to forfeit its role as the central pillar of European
security.]{.underline}

Crippling sanctions, meanwhile, could provoke Putin to lash out with
greater violence. If Putin felt cornered, he could escalate the conflict
either horizontally to other countries or vertically to the nuclear
level in a desperate effort to save himself, his regime, and, in his
mind, Russia itself. And he could find considerable public support for
such a reaction. Already, some Russians believe that U.S. and EU
sanctions are aimed not simply at the leaders behind the war but, by
cratering the economy, at all Russians.

Warning Indicators

As is the case with the current crisis in Ukraine, [Moscow's intentions
will remain **ambiguous**.]{.underline} The indicators of an approaching
escalation in the conflict beyond Ukraine are likely to fall into three
categories.

[The first indicators that political and military conditions are
increasing the risk of broader conflict include a breakdown in channels
of communication with Moscow]{.underline}. The absence of active
diplomatic ties would preclude a negotiated resolution of the conflict
in Ukraine. An end to U.S.-Russian military-to-military channels would
undermine any effort to avoid direct military conflict between the two
countries. Another indicator would be major insurgent successes that
dramatically increase Russian casualties. Moscow would be tempted to
move more aggressively against insurgent safe havens rather than
capitulate on what it considers to be its vital interest in Ukraine.

[Second are the indicators that Moscow is preparing for a broader
conflict, which it would undoubtedly argue had been forced by Western
actions]{.underline}. Such signs include Kremlin efforts to prepare the
Russian public for a wider conflict, which could entail official
statements, greater media focus on escalating Western "aggression," an
increased pace of civil defense drills, and mobilization of reserves.
Another indicator includes the massing of Russian forces in the Baltic
region. It could include such moves as aggressive hybrid actions to
destabilize Poland and the Baltic states, coupled with efforts to rally
indigenous ethnic Russian communities against their governments.

[Third are the indicators that Moscow is intentionally seeking to widen
the conflict]{.underline}. This could include greater support for
Bosnian Serb leader Dodik, such as diplomatic and financial backing, and
provision of weapons. They could also encourage Serb leaders to more
assertively pursue their grievances against Kosovo.

Implications for the United States

[A wider European conflict would pose the stiffest challenge to the
**global standing** of the United States since the end of the Cold War
and to the international system it has built and underwritten for
**decades longer**]{.underline}. [It would test the durability of its
global system of alliances and the efficacy of international regimes and
institutions that have guarded world **peace**, **security**, and
**prosperity**. The challenge would come at a time when the United
States itself is in **immense disarray**, as a deeply polarized polity
confronts massive domestic problems---the **pandemic**, **inflation**,
**racial justice**, and **cultural wars**---that leave less time and
fewer resources for foreign matters]{.underline}. [The United States
will be tested to see whether it can muster the **will**, **energy**,
and **creativity** to execute an **effective policy** toward the
unfolding crisis in Europe.]{.underline}

#### [Overcomes]{.underline} historical checks to nuclear war.

became possible," Vox, 6-29-2015,

How World War III became possible A [nuclear conflict with Russia is
**likelier than you think**]{.underline} It was in August 2014 that the
real danger began, and that we heard the first warnings of war. That
month, unmarked Russian troops covertly invaded eastern Ukraine, where
the separatist conflict had grown out of its control. The Russian air
force began harassing the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania, which are members of NATO. The US pledged that it would
uphold its commitment to defend those countries as if they were American
soil, and later staged military exercises a few hundred yards from
Russia\'s border. Both sides came to believe that the other had more
drastic intentions. [Moscow is convinced the West is **bent** on
**isolating**, **subjugating**, or **outright destroying
Russia**]{.underline}. [One in three Russians]{.underline} now [believe
the US may invade. Western nations worry]{.underline}, with reason,
[that Russia could use the threat of war, or provoke an actual conflict,
to fracture NATO and its commitment to defend Eastern Europe. This would
break the]{.underline} status quo [order that]{.underline} has
[peacefully unified Europe under Western leadership, and kept out
Russian influence, for 25 years.]{.underline} Fearing the worst of one
another, [the US and Russia have **pledged to go to war**]{.underline},
if necessary, [to defend their interests in the Eastern European
borderlands]{.underline}. They have positioned military forces and
conducted chest-thumping exercises, hoping to scare one another down.
Putin, warning repeatedly that he would use nuclear weapons in a
conflict, began forward-deploying nuclear-capable missiles and bombers.
Europe today looks disturbingly similar to the Europe of just over 100
years ago, on the eve of World War I. It is a tangle of military
commitments and defense pledges, some of them unclear and thus easier to
trigger. Its leaders have given vague signals for what would and would
not lead to war. Its political tensions have become military buildups.
[Its nations are **teetering** on an **unstable balance of
power**]{.underline}, barely held together by a Cold War--era alliance
that no longer quite applies. If you take a walk around Washington or a
Western European capital today, there is no feeling of looming
catastrophe. The threats are too complex, with many moving pieces and
overlapping layers of risk adding up to a larger danger that is less
obvious. People can be forgiven for not seeing the cloud hanging over
them, for feeling that all is well --- even as in Eastern Europe they
are digging in for war. But this complacency is itself part of the
problem, making the threat more difficult to foresee, to manage, or,
potentially, to avert. \"[There's a **low nuclear
threshold**]{.underline} now [that didn't exist during the Cold
War]{.underline}\" There is [a]{.underline} growing [**chorus** of
**political analysts**]{.underline}, **[arms control
experts]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[government
officials]{.underline}** who [are sounding the alarm]{.underline},
trying to call the world\'s attention to its drift toward disaster. The
prospect of a major war, even a [nuclear war]{.underline}, in Europe
[has become]{.underline} thinkable, they warn, even
**[plausible]{.underline}**. What they describe is a threat that
[combines many of the hair-trigger dangers and world-ending stakes of
the Cold War with the volatility and false calm that preceded World War
I --- a comparison I heard with disturbing frequency]{.underline}. They
describe a number of ways that [an unwanted but]{.underline} nonetheless
[major war]{.underline}, like that of 1914, [could \[cause\] break out
in the Eastern European borderlands. The stakes]{.underline}, they say,
could not be higher: the post--World War II peace in Europe, the lives
of thousands or millions of Eastern Europeans, or even, in a worst-case
scenario that is remote but real, the **[nuclear devastation of the
planet]{.underline}**. \[Update, Nov. 24: If you\'re reading this in
response to Turkey reportedly shooting down a Russian warplane today,
read here for why that incident will not lead to war, and why it\'s very
different from the scenarios described in this story.\] I. The warnings:
\"War is not something that\'s impossible anymore\" Everyone in Moscow
tells you that if you want to understand Russia\'s foreign policy and
its view of its place the world, the person you need to talk to is
Fyodor Lukyanov. Sober and bespectacled, with an academic\'s short brown
beard, Lukyanov speaks with the precision of a political scientist but
the occasional guardedness of someone with far greater access than your
average analyst. Widely considered both an influential leader and an
unofficial interpreter of Russia\'s foreign policy establishment,
Lukyanov is chief of Russia\'s most important foreign policy think tank
and its most important foreign policy journal, both of which reflect the
state and its worldview. He is known to be close to Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov. I met Lukyanov around the corner from the
looming Foreign Ministry compound (his office is nearby), at a small,
bohemian cafe in Moscow that serves French and Israeli food to a room
packed with gray suits. He was candid and relaxed. When the discussion
turned to the risks of war, he grew dire. \"The atmosphere is a feeling
that war is not something that's impossible anymore,\" Lukyanov told me,
describing a growing concern within Moscow\'s foreign policy elite. \"A
question that was absolutely impossible a couple of years ago, whether
there might be a war, a real war, is back,\" he said. \"People ask it.\"
Read the full interview with Fyodor Lukyanov I asked how this had
happened. He said that regular Russian people don\'t desire war, but
rather feared it would become necessary to defend against the implacably
hostile United States. \"The perception is that somebody would try to
undermine Russia as a country that opposes the United States, and then
we will need to defend ourselves by military means,\" he explained. Such
[fears, vague but existential, are everywhere in Moscow. Even liberal
opposition leaders]{.underline} I met with, pro-Western types who oppose
Putin, [expressed fears that the US posed an imminent threat to
Russia\'s security]{.underline}. I had booked my trip to Moscow in
December, hoping to get the Russian perspective on what were, at the
time, murmurings among a handful of political and arms control analysts
that conflict could come to Europe. By the time I arrived in the city,
in late April, concerns of an unintended and potentially catastrophic
war had grown unsettlingly common. Lukyanov, pointing to the US and
Russian military buildups along Eastern Europe, also worried that an
accident or provocation could be misconstrued as a deliberate attack and
lead to war. [In the Cold War]{.underline}, he pointed out, both
[sides]{.underline} had [understood this risk and installed
**political** and **physical infrastructure** --- think of the
\"emergency red phone\" --- to manage tensions and prevent them from
spiraling out of control]{.underline}. [That infrastructure is **now
gone**]{.underline}. \"All those mechanisms were disrupted or eroded,\"
he said. \"That \[infrastructure\] has been degraded since the end of
the Cold War because the common perception is that we don't need it
anymore.\" [That the world **does not see the risk**]{.underline} of war
hanging over it, in other words, **[makes that risk all the
likelier]{.underline}**. For most Americans, such predictions sound
improbable, even silly. But the dangers are growing every week, as are
the warnings. \"One can hear eerie echoes of the events a century ago
that produced the catastrophe known as World War I,\" Harvard professor
and longtime Pentagon adviser Graham Allison --- one of the graybeards
of American foreign policy --- wrote in a May cover story for the
National Interest, co-authored with Russia analyst Dimitri Simes. Their
article, \"Russia and America: Stumbling to War,\" warned that an
unwanted, full-scale conflict between the US and Russia was increasingly
plausible. In Washington, the threat feels remote. It does not in
Eastern Europe. Baltic nations, fearing war, have already begun
preparing for it. So has Sweden: \"We see Russian intelligence
operations in Sweden --- we can\'t interpret this in any other way ---
as preparation for military operations against Sweden,\" a Swedish
security official announced in March. In May, Finland\'s defense
ministry sent letters to 900,000 citizens --- one-sixth of the
population --- telling them to prepare for conscription in case of a
\"crisis situation.\" Lithuania has reinstituted military conscription.
Poland, in June, appointed a general who would take over as military
commander in case of war. Though Western publics remain blissfully
unaware, and Western leaders divided, many of the people tasked with
securing Europe are treating conflict as more likely. In late April,
NATO and other Western officials gathered in Estonia, a former Soviet
republic and NATO member on Russia\'s border that Western analysts most
worry could become ground zero for a major war with Russia. At the
conference, Deputy Secretary General Alexander Vershbow spoke so openly
about NATO\'s efforts to prepare for the possibility of Russia launching
a limited nuclear strike in Europe that, according to the journalist
Ahmed Rashid, who was in attendance, he had to be repeatedly reminded he
was speaking on the record. One of the scenarios Vershbow said NATO was
outlining, according to Rashid\'s paraphrase, was that Russia could
\"choose to use a tactical weapon with a small blast range on a European
city or a Western tank division.\" A few weeks later, the Guardian
reported that NATO is considering plans to \"upgrade\" its nuclear
posture in Europe in response to Russia\'s own nuclear saber-rattling.
One proposal: for NATO\'s military exercises to include more nuclear
weapons use, something Russia already does frequently. II. The gamble:
Putin\'s plan to make Russia great again Should the warnings prove
right, and a major war break out in Europe between Russia and the West,
then the story of that war, if anyone is still around to tell it, will
begin with Russian President Vladimir Putin trying to solve a problem.
That problem is this: [Putin\'s Russia is weak]{.underline}. It [can no
longer stand toe to toe with the US]{.underline}. It no longer has
Europe divided in a stalemate; rather, it sees the continent as
dominated by an ever-encroaching anti-Russian alliance. [In the Russian
view, the country\'s weakness leaves it at imminent risk, vulnerable to
a hostile West bent on subjugating or outright destroying Russia as it
did to Iraq and Libya. This is made more urgent for Putin by his
political problems at home]{.underline}. In 2012, during his reelection,
popular protests and accusations of fraud weakened his sense of
political legitimacy. The problem worsened with Russia\'s 2014 economic
collapse; Putin\'s implicit bargain with the Russian people had been
that he would deliver economic growth and they would let him erode basic
rights. Without the economy, what did he have to offer them? Putin\'s
answer has been to assert Russian power beyond its actual strength ---
and, in the process, to recast himself as a national hero guarding
against foreign enemies. Without a world-power-class military or economy
at his disposal, he is instead wielding confusion and uncertainty ---
which Soviet leaders rightly avoided as existential dangers --- as
weapons against the West. Unable to overtly control Eastern Europe, he
has fomented risks and crises there, sponsoring separatists in Ukraine
and conducting dangerous military activity along NATO airspace and
coastal borders, giving Russia more leverage there. Reasserting a
Russian sphere of influence over Eastern Europe, he apparently believes,
will finally give Russia security from the hostile West --- and make
Russia a great power once more. Knowing his military is outmatched
against the Americans, [he is blurring the distinction between **war**
and **peace**, deploying]{.underline} tactics that exist in, and thus
widen, the gray between: [militia violence, propaganda, cyberattacks,
under a new rubric the Russian military sometimes calls \"**hybrid
war**.\"]{.underline} \"This was the theory of the Kaiser before World
War I: The more threatening you are, the more people will submit to your
will. Putin's going to threaten and threaten and hope that NATO bends.
But the long run of international relations suggests that it goes the
other way.\" Unable to cross America\'s red lines, Putin is doing his
best to muddy them --- and, to deter the Americans, muddying his own.
Turning otherwise routine diplomatic and military incidents into games
of high-stakes chicken favors Russia, he believes, as the West will
ultimately yield to his superior will. To solve the problem of Russia\'s
conventional military weakness, he has dramatically lowered the
threshold for when he would use nuclear weapons, hoping to terrify the
West such that it will bend to avoid conflict. In public speeches, over
and over, he references those weapons and his willingness to use them.
He has enshrined, in Russia\'s official nuclear doctrine, a dangerous
idea no Soviet leader ever adopted: that a nuclear war could be
winnable. Putin, having recast himself at home as a national hero
standing up to foreign enemies, is more popular than ever. Russia has
once more become a shadow hanging over Eastern Europe, feared and only
rarely bowed to, but always taken seriously. Many Western Europeans,
asked in a poll whether they would defend their own Eastern European
allies from a Russian invasion, said no. Russia\'s aggression, born of
both a desire to reengineer a European order that it views as hostile
and a sense of existential weakness that justifies drastic measures,
makes it far more willing to accept the dangers of war. As RAND\'s F.
Stephen Larrabee wrote in one of the increasingly urgent warnings that
some analysts are issuing, \"The Russia that the United States faces
today is more assertive and more unpredictable --- and thus, in many
ways, more dangerous --- than the Russia that the United States
confronted during the latter part of the Cold War.\" Joseph Nye, the
dean of Harvard University\'s school of government and one of America\'s
most respected international relations scholars, pointed out that
Russia\'s weakness-masking aggression was yet another disturbing
parallel to the buildup to World War I. \"Russia seems doomed to
continue its decline --- an outcome that should be no cause for
celebration in the West,\" Nye wrote in a recent column. \"States in
decline --- think of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1914 --- tend to
become less risk-averse and thus much more dangerous.\" III. The drift:
How the unthinkable became possible The Cold War was a dangerous game,
but it was a game in which everyone knew and agreed upon the stakes and
the rules. That is not the case today. The Western side believes it is
playing a game where the rules are clear enough, the stakes relatively
modest, and the competition easily winnable. [The Russian
side]{.underline}, however, [sees a game where the rules can be
**rewritten on the fly**]{.underline}, [even the **definition of war
itself** altered]{.underline}. For Russia, fearing a threat from the
West it sees as imminent and existential, the stakes are unimaginably
high, justifying virtually any action or gamble if it could deter defeat
and, perhaps, lead to victory. Separately, the ever-paranoid Kremlin
believes that the West is playing the same game in Ukraine. Western
support for Ukraine\'s government and efforts to broker a ceasefire to
the war there, Moscow believes, are really a plot to encircle Russia
with hostile puppet states and to rob Russia of its rightful sphere of
influence. Repeated Russian warnings that it would go to war to defend
its perceived interests in Ukraine, potentially even nuclear war, are
dismissed in most Western capitals as bluffing, mere rhetoric. Western
leaders view these threats through Western eyes, in which impoverished
Ukraine would never be worth risking a major war. [In Russian eyes,
Ukraine looks]{.underline} much more **[important]{.underline}**: an
[extension of Russian heritage that is **sacrosanct** and]{.underline},
as the final remaining component of the empire, [a strategic loss that
would **unacceptably weaken Russian strength**]{.underline} and thus
Russian security. [Both side are gambling and guessing in the absence of
a clear understanding of what the other side truly intends, how it will
act, what will and will not trigger the **invisible triplines** that
would send us **careening into war**]{.underline}. Today\'s tensions
bear far more similarity to the period before World War I During the
Cold War, the comparably matched Western and Soviet blocs prepared for
war but also made sure that war never came. They locked Europe in a
tense but stable balance of power; that balance is gone. They set clear
red lines and vowed to defend them at all costs. Today, those red lines
are murky and ill-defined. Neither side is sure where they lie or what
really happens if they are crossed. No one can say for sure what would
trigger war. That is why, analysts will tell you, today\'s tensions bear
far more similarity to the period before World War I: an unstable power
balance, belligerence over peripheral conflicts, entangling military
commitments, disputes over the future of the European order, and
dangerous uncertainty about what actions will and will not force the
other party into conflict. Today\'s Russia, once more the strongest
nation in Europe and yet weaker than its collective enemies, calls to
mind the turn-of-the-century German Empire, which Henry Kissinger
described as \"too big for Europe, but too small for the world.\" Now,
as then, a rising power, propelled by nationalism, is seeking to revise
the European order. Now, as then, it believes that through superior
cunning, and perhaps even by proving its might, it can force a larger
role for itself. Now, as then, the drift toward war is gradual and easy
to miss --- which is exactly what makes it so dangerous. But there is
one way in which today\'s dangers are less like those before World War
I, and more similar to those of the Cold War: the apocalyptic logic of
nuclear weapons. Mutual suspicion, fear of an existential threat, armies
parked across borders from one another, and hair-trigger nuclear weapons
all make any small skirmish a potential armageddon. In some ways, that
logic has grown even more dangerous. Russia, hoping to compensate for
its conventional military forces\' relative weakness, has dramatically
relaxed its rules for using nuclear weapons. Whereas Soviet leaders saw
their nuclear weapons as pure deterrents, something that existed
precisely so they would never be used, Putin\'s view appears to be
radically different. Russia\'s official nuclear doctrine calls on the
country to launch a battlefield nuclear strike in case of a conventional
war that could pose an existential threat. These are more than just
words: Moscow has repeatedly signaled its willingness and preparations
to use nuclear weapons even in a more limited war. This is a
terrifyingly low bar for nuclear weapons use, particularly given that
any war would likely occur along Russia\'s borders and thus not far from
Moscow. And it suggests Putin has adopted an idea that Cold War leaders
considered unthinkable: that a \"limited\" nuclear war, of small
warheads dropped on the battlefield, could be not only survivable but
winnable. \"It's not just a difference in rhetoric. It's a whole
different world,\" Bruce G. Blair, a nuclear weapons scholar at
Princeton, told the Wall Street Journal. He called Putin\'s decisions
more dangerous than those of any Soviet leader since 1962. \"There's a
low nuclear threshold now that didn't exist during the Cold War.\"
Nuclear theory is complex and disputable; [maybe Putin is right. But
many theorists would say he is wrong, that the logic of nuclear warfare
means a \"limited\" nuclear strike is in fact likely to trigger a
**larger nuclear war**]{.underline} --- [a **doomsday scenario** in
which major **American**, **Russian**, and **European** cities would be
targets for attacks many times more powerful than the bombs that leveled
Hiroshima and Nagasaki]{.underline}. Even if a nuclear war did somehow
remain limited and contained, recent studies suggest that environmental
and atmospheric damage would cause a \"decade of winter\" and mass crop
die-outs that could kill up to 1 billion people in a global famine. IV.
How it would happen: The Baltics scenario In September of last year,
President Obama traveled to Estonia, a nation of 1.3 million people that
most Americans have never heard of, and pledged that the United States
would if necessary go to war with Russia to defend it. Estonia, along
with Latvia and Lithuania --- together known as the Baltic states ---
are at the far edge of Eastern Europe, along Russia\'s border. They were
formerly part of the Soviet Union. And they are where many Western
analysts fear World War III is likeliest to start. These small countries
are \"the most likely front line of any future crisis,\" according to
Stephen Saideman, an international relations professor at Carleton
University. Allison and Simes, in their essay warning of war, called the
Baltics \"the Achilles' heel of the NATO alliance.\" A full quarter of
Estonia\'s population is ethnically Russian. Clustered on the border
with Russia, this minority is served by the same Russian state media
that helped stir up separatist violence among Russian speakers in
eastern Ukraine. But unlike Ukraine, the Baltic states are all members
of NATO, whose charter states that an attack on one member is an attack
on them all. Whereas a Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted Western
sanctions, a Russian invasion of Estonia would legally obligate the US
and most of Europe to declare war on Moscow. \"We\'ll be here for
Estonia. We will be here for Latvia. We will be here for Lithuania. You
lost your independence once before. With NATO, you will never lose it
again,\" Obama pledged in his September speech in Estonia. Less than 48
hours after Obama\'s address, Russian agents blanketed an Estonia-Russia
border crossing with tear gas, stormed across, and kidnapped an Estonian
state security officer, Eston Kohver, who specialized in
counterintelligence. Kohver has been held illegally in a Russian prison
for nine months now. It was something like an act of geopolitical
trolling: aggressive enough to assert Russian dominion over Estonia, but
not so aggressive as to be considered a formal act of war that would
trigger a Western counterattack. And it was one of several signs that
Putin\'s Russia is asserting a right to meddle in these former Soviet
territories. The Russian military has already begun pressing the Baltic
states. Russian warships were spotted in Latvian waters 40 times in
2014. Russian military flights over the Baltics are now routine, often
with the planes switching off their transponders, which makes them
harder to spot and increases the chances of an accident. Military
activity in the region had reached Cold War levels. NATO, fearing the
worst, is increasing military exercises in the Baltics. The US is
installing heavy equipment. And in February, the US military paraded
through the Russian-majority Estonian city of Narva, a few hundred yards
from Russia\'s borders. \"Without any intention to create the big
conflict, it might happen. One step, another step, and reciprocity can
become very dangerous.\" It\'s a textbook example of what political
scientists call the security dilemma: Each side sees its actions as
defensive and the other side\'s as offensive. Each responds to the
other\'s perceived provocations by escalating further, a
self-reinforcing cycle that can all too easily lead to war. It is
considered, for example, a major contributor to the outbreak of World
War I. That it is entirely foreseeable does little to reduce the risk.
Even if Russia in fact has no designs on the Baltics, its bluffing and
posturing has already created the conditions for an unwanted war. In
early April, for example, a Russian fighter jet crossed into the Baltic
Sea and \"buzzed\" a US military plane, missing it by only 20 feet. It
was one of several recent near-misses that, according to a think tank
called the European Leadership Institute, have had a \"high probability
of causing casualties or a direct military confrontation between Russia
and Western states.\" Meanwhile, Russia has been flying its
nuclear-capable strategic bombers along NATO airspace, often with the
planes\' transponders switched off, making an accident or misperception
more likely. As if that weren\'t dangerous enough, the bombers ---
hulking, decades-old Tupolev Tu-95 models --- have become prone to
accidents such as engine fires. What if a Tu-95 went down unexpectedly,
say, off the coast of Norway? What if it was carrying nuclear warheads,
or it went down during a moment of high tension? Such incidents can lead
to misunderstandings, and such misunderstandings can lead to war. By
late April, when NATO officials gathered at the security conference in
Estonia\'s capital of Tallinn, the severity of the danger had become
unmistakable. As Ahmed Rashid wrote from the conference: Baltic
presidents and NATO officials were unusually blunt in describing the
extent to which the security architecture in Eastern Europe has
collapsed, how Russia poses the gravest threat to peace since World War
II, and how the conflict in Ukraine and the loss of the Crimea has left
the Baltic states on the front line of an increasingly hostile standoff.
Amid these tensions, the thought of a plane crash leading to war seems
scarily plausible. It is not just Western officials who fear such an
incident could spark war. Fyodor Lukyanov, the prominent Russian analyst
who is considered close to the government, worried that the NATO
military exercises in the Baltics meant to deter Russia were also
contributing to the problem. \"Russia reacts to that because Russia
perceives it as a hostile approach to the Russian border,\" he
explained. \"And it's a vicious circle.\" It is easy to imagine,
Lukyanov said, any number of ways that the powder keg could explode.
\"Without any intention to create the big conflict, it might happen,\"
he said. \"One step, another step, and reciprocity can become very
dangerous. Say a Russian aircraft comes very close to an area that NATO
believes is prohibited while Russia believes it's not prohibited, and
then British aircraft respond. It might be manageable, and in most cases
of course it will be, but who knows.\" V. How it would happen: A plot to
break NATO It was Andrei Piontkovsky, a Russian political analyst and
frequent Kremlin critic, who first suggested the theory, last August,
that Putin\'s plan for the Baltics was more sophisticated, and more
calculated, than anybody realized. Piontkovsky was trying to answer a
question that Western analysts and policymakers had been puzzling over
since Russian provocations began in the Baltics last fall: What does
Putin want? Unlike in Ukraine, with which Russia has a long shared
history, there is little demand among the Russian public for
intervention in the Baltic states. They are of modest strategic value.
And the risks of Russia\'s aggression there are potentially
catastrophic. Why bother? His is a theory that is now taken much more
seriously by Western policymakers --- and appears more plausible all the
time. \"This is his most cherished objective, to destroy NATO. The risk
is big, yes? But the prize is enormous.\" Putin hopes to spark a
conflict in the Baltics, Piontkovsky wrote, so as to force Western
European leaders into an impossible choice: Fulfill their NATO
obligation to defend the Baltics and counterattack, even if it means
fighting World War III over a tiny post-Soviet republic most Europeans
couldn\'t care less about --- or do nothing. The implications of doing
nothing, Piontkovsky pointed out, would extend far beyond the Baltics.
It would lay bare NATO\'s mutual defense provision as a lie, effectively
dissolving the military alliance, ending a quarter-century of Europe\'s
security unification under Western leadership, and leaving Eastern
Europe once more vulnerable to Russian domination. In this way, Putin
could do what Soviet leaders never came close to: defeat NATO. \"This is
his most cherished objective,\" Piontkovsky told me when we talked in
his kitchen, in a leafy Moscow neighborhood across the river from Gorky
Park. \"It\'s an enormous temptation. He may retreat at any stage, but
the temptation is enormous, to destroy NATO. \... The risk is big, yes?
But the prize is enormous.\" \"To destroy NATO, to demonstrate that
Article V does not work, the Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia are
the best place for this,\" he said. \"It\'s happening now, every day.
Intrusions into the airspace, psychological pressure, the propaganda on
TV.\" He suggested that Putin, rather than rolling Russian tanks across
the border, would perhaps seed unmarked Russian special forces into,
say, the Russian-majority city of Narva in Estonia, where they would
organize localized violence or a phony independence referendum. A
handful of such unacknowledged forces, whom Putin referred to as
\"little green men\" after they appeared in Crimea, would perhaps be
dressed as local volunteers or a far-right gang; they might be joined by
vigilantes, as they were in eastern Ukraine. They would almost certainly
be aided by a wave of Russian propaganda, making it harder for outsiders
to differentiate unmarked Russian troops from civilian volunteers, to
determine who was fighting where and had started what. Such an
intervention would force NATO into an impossible choice: Are you really
going to open fire on some hoodlums stirring up trouble in Estonia,
knowing they might actually be unmarked Russian troops? Would you risk
the first major European war since 1945, all to eject some unmarked
Russian troops from the Estonian town of Narva? Putin, Piontkovsky
believes, is gambling that the answer is no. That NATO would not
intervene, thus effectively abandoning its commitment to defend its
Eastern European member states. Piontkovsky\'s scenario, once considered
extreme, is now widely seen by Western security experts and policymakers
as plausible. At the end of 2014, the military intelligence service of
Denmark, a member of NATO, issued a formal paper warning of precisely
that: Russia may attempt to test NATO's cohesion by engaging in military
intimidation of the Baltic countries, for instance with a threatening
military build-up close to the borders of these countries and
simultaneous attempts of political pressure, destabilization and
possibly infiltration. Russia could launch such an intimidation campaign
in connection with a serious crisis in the post-Soviet space or another
international crisis in which Russia confronts the United States and
NATO. \"The concern is that what Putin wants to do is break NATO, and
the best way to do that would be to poach on the Baltics,\" Saideman,
the political scientist, told me on a call from a European security
conference where he said the scenario was being taken very seriously.
\"And if Germany doesn't respond to incursions in the Baltics, if France
doesn't respond and it's just an American operation, then it will lead
to the breaking of NATO, is the theory,\" he said. \"That's the biggest
concern.\" Saideman described a variation on this scenario that I heard
from others as well: that Putin might attempt to seize some small sliver
of the Baltics quickly and bloodlessly. This would make it politically
easier for Western European leaders to do nothing --- how to rally your
nation to war if hardly anyone has even been killed? --- and harder to
counterattack, knowing it would require a full-scale invasion. \"I think
they're very serious about this,\" Saideman said. \"There's a real
concern.\" VI. **[How it would happen: The fog of hybrid
war]{.underline}** In early 2015, Pew pollsters asked citizens of
several NATO states the exact question that analysts and policymakers
from Washington to Moscow are gaming out: \"If Russia got into a serious
military conflict with one of its neighboring countries that is our NATO
ally, do you think our country should or should not use military force
to defend that country?\" The numbers from Western Europe were alarming:
Among Germans, only 38 percent said yes; 58 percent said no. If it were
up to German voters --- and to at least some extent, it is --- NATO
would effectively surrender the Baltics to Russia in a conflict. This
poll is even worse than it looks. It assumes that Russia would launch an
overt military invasion of the Baltics. [What would]{.underline}
actually [happen is something **far murkier**]{.underline}, and far
[more likely to **leverage European hesitation**]{.underline}: [the
playbook from Ukraine, where Russia deployed its newly developed
concepts of postmodern \"**hybrid war**,\" designed to **blur the
distinction** between **war** and **not-war**]{.underline}, [to make
it]{.underline} as [difficult]{.underline} as possible [to differentiate
**grassroots unrest** or **vigilante cyberattacks** from Russian
military aggression]{.underline}. Putin may already be laying the
groundwork. In March of 2014, shortly after Russia had annexed Crimea,
Putin gave a speech there pledging to protect Russians even outside of
Russia, which many took as a gesture to the substantial Russian
minorities in the Baltics. \"That kind of
**[misperception]{.underline}** situation [is]{.underline} definitely
[possible]{.underline}, and that's how wars start\" Then, in October,
Putin warned that \"open manifestations of neo-Nazism\" had \"become
commonplace in Latvia and other Baltic states\" --- repeating the
language that he and Russian state media had earlier used to frighten
Russian speakers in Ukraine into taking up arms. This April, several
Russian outlets issued spurious reports that Latvia was planning to
forcibly relocate ethnic Russians into Nazi-style ghettos --- an echo of
similar scaremongering Russian propaganda broadcast in the runup in
Ukraine. Martin Hurt, a former senior official of the country\'s defense
ministry, warned that his country\'s ethnic Russian minority could be
\"receptive to Kremlin disinformation.\" Moscow, he said, could generate
unrest \"as a pretext to use military force against the Baltic states.\"
In early 2007, Estonia\'s parliament voted to relocate a Soviet-era
military statue, the Bronze Soldier, that had become a cultural symbol
and annual rallying point for the country\'s ethnic Russians. In
response, Russian politicians and state media accused the Estonian
government of fascism and Nazi-style discrimination against ethnic
Russians; they issued false reports claiming ethnic Russians were being
tortured and murdered. Protests broke out and escalated into riots and
mass looting. One person was killed in the violence, and the next day
hackers took many of the country\'s major institutions offline. Russia
could do it again, only this time gradually escalating further toward a
Ukraine-style conflict. NATO is just not built to deal with such a
crisis. Its mutual defense pledge, after all, rests on the assumption
that war is a black-and-white concept, that a country is either at war
or not at war. Its charter is from a time when war was very different
than it is today, with its many shades of gray. Russia can exploit this
flaw by introducing low-level violence that more hawkish NATO members
would consider grounds for war but that war-averse Western European
states might not see that way. Disagreement among NATO\'s member states
would be guaranteed as they hesitated over where to declare a moment
when Russia had crossed the line into war. Meanwhile, Russian state
media, which has shown real influence in Western Europe, would unleash a
flurry of propaganda to confuse the issue, make it harder to pin blame
on Moscow for the violence, and gin up skepticism of any American calls
for war. Germany, which is widely considered the deciding vote on
whether Europe would go to war, would be particularly resistant to going
to war. The legacy of World War II and the ideology of pacifism and
compromise make even the idea of declaring war on Russia unthinkable.
German leaders would come under intense political pressure to, if not
reject the call to arms, then at least delay and negotiate --- a de
facto rejection of NATO\'s collective self-defense. In such a scenario,
it is disturbingly easy to imagine how NATO\'s European member states
could split over whether Russia had even crossed their red line for war,
much less whether to respond. [Under a fog of **confusion** and
**doubt**, Russia could **gradually escalate** until a Ukraine-style
conflict in the Baltics was foregone, until it had marched **far across
NATO\'s red line**]{.underline}, exposing that red line as meaningless.
But the greatest danger of all is if [Putin\'s plan]{.underline} were to
stumble: By overreaching, by underestimating Western resolve to defend
the Baltics, or by starting something that escalates beyond his control,
it [could]{.underline} all too [easily lead to **full-blown
war**]{.underline}. \"That kind of misperception situation is definitely
possible, and that's how wars start,\" Saideman said, going on to
compare Europe today with 1914, just before World War I. \"The thing
that makes war most thinkable is when other people don't think it's
thinkable.\" In 1963, a few months after the Cuban missile crisis had
almost brought the US and Soviet Union to blows, President John F.
Kennedy gave a speech drawing on the lessons of the world\'s brush with
nuclear war: \"Above all, while defending our vital interests, [nuclear
powers must avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a
choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war]{.underline}.\"
That is the choice that Putin may well force upon NATO. VII. How it
would happen: The Ukraine scenario Evgeny Buzhinsky has spent much of
his professional life with the threat of global nuclear destruction
hanging over his head. A lifelong Russian military officer, he earned
his PhD in military sciences in 1982, just as the Cold War entered one
of its most dangerous periods, and rose to the General Staff, where he
remained for years after the Soviet Union\'s collapse, through periods
of calm and of tension. He retired in 2009 as a lieutenant general and
remains active in Russian national security circles, now heading the PIR
Center, a well-respected Russian think tank that focuses on military,
national security, and arms control issues. Buzhinsky, when I met him in
Moscow, had a warning for me. Those in the West who worried about the
possibility of a major war breaking out in the Baltics were missing the
real threat: Ukraine. The US, he feared, does not appreciate how far
Russia is willing to go to avoid a defeat in Ukraine, and this
miscalculation could pull them into conflict. \"Ukraine, for Russia, is
a red line,\" he warned. \"And especially a Ukraine that is hostile to
Russia is a definite red line. But the US administration decided that
it\'s not.\" This was a concern I heard more than once in Russia. When
Fyodor Lukyanov, the Moscow foreign policy insider, warned that Russian
foreign policy officials saw a major war as increasingly possible, and I
asked him how they thought it would happen, he cited Ukraine. \"For
example, massive military help to Ukraine from the United States --- it
could start as a proxy war, and then \...\" he trailed off Lukyanov
worried that the US does not understand Russia\'s sense of ownership
over Ukraine, the lengths it would go to protect its interests there.
\"It's seen by many people as something that's actually a part of our
country, or if not part of our country then a country that's absolutely
essential to Russia's security,\" he said. Buzhinsky is one of those
people. Like Lukyanov and other Russian analysts, he worried that the
United States had wrongly concluded that Putin would ultimately
acquiesce if he faced likely defeat in Ukraine. The Americans, he said,
were dangerously mistaken. Gregarious, bear-sized, and clearly
accustomed to dealing with Westerners from overseeing arms control
treaties during much of the 1990s, Buzhinsky sipped a grapefruit juice
when we met in downtown Moscow. \"A year ago, I was absolutely convinced
Russia would never intervene militarily,\" he said about the possibility
of a full, overt Russian invasion of Ukraine. \"Now I\'m not so sure.\"
The view of the Russian government, he said, was that it could never
allow the defeat of the pro-Russia separatist rebels in the eastern
Ukraine region sometimes called Donbas. (In August, when those rebels
appeared on the verge of defeat, Russia provided them with artillery
support and covertly sent troops to fight alongside them, none of which
Moscow has acknowledged.) If Ukrainian forces were about to overrun the
separatist rebels, Buzhinsky said, he believed that Russia would respond
not just with an overt invasion, but by marching to Ukraine\'s capital
of Kiev. \"A massive offensive on the Ukrainian side\" against the
rebels, he said, would lead Russia to openly enter the war. \"A war with
Russia in Ukraine --- if Russia starts a war, it never stops until it
takes the capital.\" When I asked Buzhinsky if he really believed Putin
would launch a full Russian invasion of Kiev in response to a Ukrainian
effort to retake Donbas, he answered, \"Yes, definitely. He said twice
publicly, \'I won\'t let it happen.\' As he is a man of his word, I am
sure he will.\" Such a scenario, he said, could lead to a larger
conflict no one wants. The Americans believe that \"Russia will never
dare, Putin will never dare, to interfere,\" leaving the US unprepared
in case it should happen. \"And then I could not predict the reaction of
the United States and NATO.\" Buzhinsky outlined another way he feared
Ukraine could lead to a larger war. If the US provided sophisticated
military equipment to Ukraine that required putting American trainers or
operators near the front lines, and one of them was killed, he believed
the US might feel compelled to intervene outright in Ukraine. Would
Russia really risk a major war over Ukraine, one of Europe\'s poorest
countries? For months, Moscow has been suggesting that Western military
involvement in Ukraine, even something as mild as providing the
Ukrainian military with certain arms, would be taken as an act of war
against Russia. Like Putin\'s threats to use nuclear weapons, this has
been shrugged off as bluster, mere rhetoric, just for scoring domestic
political points. What Buzhinsky was trying to underline to me was that
the threats are real --- that Russia might consider its interests in
Ukraine so vital that it would risk or even fight a war to protect them.
He was not alone in saying this --- I heard it from many others in
Moscow, including Russian analysts who are critical of their country\'s
Ukraine policy as too aggressive. Buzhinsky explained that Russia had
set this as a red line out of the fear that a Ukrainian reconquest of
eastern Ukraine would lead to \"the physical extermination of the people
of Donbas,\" many of whom are Russian speakers with cultural links to
Russia. Russian state media has drilled this fear into the peoples of
Ukraine and Russia for a year now. It does not have to be true to serve
as casus belli; Moscow deployed a similar justification for its
annexation of Crimea. \"You don\'t get to walk this back\" The
connection to Ukraine is often expressed by everyday Russians as an
issue of cultural heritage; Kievan Rus, a medieval Slavic federation
with its capital in the present-day Ukrainian capital of Kiev, is
something like Russia\'s predecessor state. But this is likely about
more than nationalism or kinship with Russian-speaking Ukrainians.
Moscow is notorious for its conviction that the US is bent on Russia\'s
destruction, or at least its subjugation. It is paranoid and painfully
aware of its isolation and its comparative weakness. A hostile and
pro-Western Ukraine, Putin may have concluded, would pose an existential
threat by further weakening Russia beyond what it can afford. Allison
and Simes, in their essay on the risk of war, described Ukraine as a
potential ground zero for wider conflict because of this. \"Russia's
establishment sentiment holds that the country can never be secure if
Ukraine joins NATO or becomes a part of a hostile Euro-Atlantic
community,\" they wrote. \"From \[Moscow\'s\] perspective, this makes
Ukraine's non-adversarial status a non-negotiable demand for any Russia
powerful enough to defend its national-security interests.\" It is
practically a cliché in international relations: \"Russia without
Ukraine is a country, Russia with Ukraine is an empire.\" Putin\'s
Russia appears to believe that reclaiming great-power status is the only
way it can guarantee security against a hostile West. Jeffrey Lewis, an
arms control expert, traced this Russian government obsession with
Ukraine back to Putin\'s political weakness at home, as well as
Russia\'s sense of military insecurity against a hostile and
overwhelmingly powerful West. \"I suspect that the desire to unite the
Russian world and to subjugate the non-Russian neighbors is driven by a
fundamental sense of insecurity,\" Lewis said in a much-circulated
September podcast on Putin\'s nuclear threats. \"That, like the Soviet
leadership, he has to try very hard to stay in power, and so there's a
tendency as his legitimacy declines to try to blame outside forces. And
the problem is that when you try to look at the world in that
conspiratorial way, there's always a justification for subjugating the
next set of neighbors.\" This means that should the US or other Western
countries become sufficiently involved in Ukraine that Russia cannot
maintain control of the conflict, then Russia may feel this puts it at
such existential threat that it has no choice but to escalate in
response. Even at [the risk of war]{.underline}. Russia knows it would
lose a full-blown war with NATO, of course, but it has other options. An
official with the Russian Defense Ministry\'s public advisory board told
the Moscow Times that should Western countries arm Ukraine\'s military,
it [would respond by escalating]{.underline} in Ukraine itself as well
as \"**[asymmetrically]{.underline}** [against Washington or its
allies]{.underline} on other fronts.\" [Russian asymmetrical acts
---]{.underline} cyberattacks, [propaganda operations meant to create
panic, military flights]{.underline}, even little green men ---
[are]{.underline} all [effective]{.underline} precisely [because they
introduce **uncertainty** and **risk**]{.underline}. If that sounds
dangerous, it is. [American and NATO **red lines** for what acts of
\"asymmetry\" would and would not trigger war are **unclear** and
**poorly defined**. Russia could easily cross such a line **without
meaning to**]{.underline}, or could create enough confusion that the US
believes it or its allies are under a severe enough threat to demand
retaliation. \"You don\'t get to walk this back,\" Matthew Rojansky, the
director of the Kennan Institute, warned in comments to the New York
Times about what could happen if the US armed Ukraine\'s military, as
Congress is pushing Obama to do. \"Once we have done this we become a
belligerent party in a proxy war with Russia, the only country on Earth
that can destroy the United States,\" Rojansky said. \"That's why this
is a big deal.\" VIII. The nuclear dangers: [The red line is **closer
than you think**]{.underline} This August, as the Russian military
launched its undeclared and unofficial invasion of eastern Ukraine to
defend separatist rebels there against defeat, Putin attended an annual
youth conference at Lake Seliger, just north of Moscow. During a Q&A
session, a teaching student asked an odd question about the \"cyclical\"
nature of history and concerns that Russia could be \"drawn into a new,
open global conflict.\" Putin, in his answer, did something that the
leaders of major nuclear powers generally avoid doing --- he rattled the
nuclear saber a bit: Let me remind you that Russia is one of the world's
biggest nuclear powers. These are not just words --- this is the
reality. What's more, we are strengthening our nuclear deterrent
capability and developing our armed forces. They have become more
compact and effective and are becoming more modern in terms of the
weapons at their disposal. There is a certain fear in Russia, never far
from the surface, that the only thing preventing the West from realizing
its dream of destroying or subjugating Russia is its nuclear arsenal.
(Three months later, Putin warned that the West wanted to tame the
Russian bear so as to \"tear out his fangs and his claws,\" which he
explained meant its nuclear weapons.) \"There is a widespread belief
that the only guarantee for Russian security, if not sovereignty and
existence, is the nuclear deterrent,\" Lukyanov, the Russian foreign
policy expert, explained. \"After the Yugoslavia wars, Iraq War, Libyan
intervention, it's not an argument anymore, it's conventional wisdom:
\'If Russia were not a nuclear superpower, the regime change of an Iraqi
or Libyan style would be inevitable here. The Americans are so unhappy
with the Russian regime, they would do it. Praise God, we have a nuclear
arsenal, and that makes us untouchable.\'\" But Russia faced a problem:
Its conventional military forces are now so much weaker than NATO\'s,
and its capital city so close to NATO\'s forces in the Baltics, that it
feared NATO tank divisions could push all the way to Moscow and quickly
win a war without ever using a nuclear weapon. Both the US and Russia
had pledged to use nuclear weapons only to deter one another from
nuclear attacks. This kept the Cold War cold. But because the US would
not need its ICBMs to win a war, that [deterrence is **no longer
enough**]{.underline} [to keep Russia safe]{.underline}. In response,
[Russia has been gradually **lowering its bar**]{.underline} [for when
it would use nuclear weapons, and in the process **upending the
decades-old logic of mutually assured destruction**, adding **tremendous
nuclear danger**]{.underline} [to any conflict in Europe]{.underline}.
The possibility that [a limited or unintended skirmish could **spiral**
into nuclear war]{.underline} is higher than ever. Russia\'s nuclear
doctrine, a formal document the Kremlin publishes every few years
outlining when it will and will not use nuclear weapons, declares that
the Russian military can launch nuclear weapons not just in the case of
a nuclear attack, but in case of a conventional military attack that
poses an existential threat. In other words, if Russia believes that
American tanks could be bound for the Kremlin, it has declared it may
respond by dropping nuclear bombs. The danger that this adds to any
possible confrontation, particularly along the Baltic states, is
difficult to overstate. If an accident or miscalculation were to lead to
a border skirmish, all it would take is for the Kremlin to misperceive
the fighting as the beginning of an assault toward Moscow and its own
doctrine would call for using nuclear weapons. Indeed, it would be the
only way to avoid total defeat. There is another layer of danger and
uncertainty to this: [It is not clear what Russia would consider a
conventional threat worthy of a nuclear response]{.underline}. A few
months after he\'d annexed Crimea, Putin revealed that during Russia\'s
undeclared invasion of the territory he had considered putting his
country\'s nuclear forces on alert; his government has signaled it would
consider using nuclear force to defend Crimea from an attack, something
Russian analysts told me was not just bluster. The United States, of
course, has no intention of militarily retaking Crimea, despite
surprisingly common fears to the contrary in Russia. But Russian
paranoia about such a threat, and a possible willingness to use nuclear
weapons to avert it, adds more danger to the already dangerous war in
eastern Ukraine and the fears that greater Russian or Western
involvement there could spark a broader conflict. And the Crimea
revelation raises a disconcerting question: Where exactly does Moscow
place the line for a threat severe enough to use nuclear weapons? Its
doctrine says they should be used only against an existential threat,
but an attack on Crimea would be far from existentially dangerous. We
can only guess where the real red line lays, and hope not to cross it by
mistake. IX. The nuclear dangers: How Putin is pushing us back to the
brink There is a specific moment that arms control experts often cite to
highlight the dangers of nuclear weapons, how they kept the world
poised, for years at a time, mere minutes away from nuclear devastation.
That moment was September 26, 1983. That evening, a Russian lieutenant
colonel named Stanislav Petrov settled in for his shift overseeing the
Soviet Union\'s missile attack early warning system. Petrov had a
top-secret network of satellites, all pointed squarely at the United
States and its arsenal of nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic
missiles, which pointed back at him. The US and Soviet Union were
ramping up development of ICBMs, which could circle the globe in 30
minutes and reduce an enemy city to ash. Both sides were driven by fear
that the other could one day gain the ability to launch a preemptive
nuclear strike so devastating and so fast that it would start and win
the war within hours. Each sought to develop ever more sensitive warning
systems, and ever more rapid mechanisms for retaliation, to deter the
threat. Petrov ran one such warning system. If he caught an American
attack as soon as it crossed his sensors, it would give the Soviet
leadership about 20 minutes of warning time. That was their window to
determine how to respond. The space for mistakes was effectively zero.
Five hours into Petrov\'s shift that night, something he had never
encountered in his 11-year career happened: The system went into full
alarm. The word \"LAUNCH\" displayed in large red letters. The screen
announced a \"high reliability\" of an American ICBM barreling toward
the Soviet Union. Petrov had to make a decision: Would he report an
incoming American strike? If he did, Soviet nuclear doctrine called for
a full nuclear retaliation; there would be no time to double-check the
warning system, much less seek negotiations with the US. If he didn\'t,
and he was wrong, he would have left his country defenseless, an act
tantamount to treason. His gut instinct told him the warning was in
error, but when he flipped through the incoming imagery and data and he
could reach no hard conclusion from it. After a few moments, he called
his superiors and stated categorically that it was a false alarm. There
was, he insisted, no attack. Petrov waited in agony for 23 minutes ---
the missile\'s estimated time to target --- before he knew for sure that
he\'d been right. Only a few people were aware of it at the time, but
thanks to Petrov, the world had only barely avoided World War III and,
potentially, total nuclear annihilation. The US and Soviet Union, shaken
by this and other near-misses, spent the next few years stepping back
from the brink. They decommissioned a large number of nuclear warheads
and signed treaties to limit their deployment. One of their most
important measures was a 1987 agreement called the Intermediate-Range
Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which saw both sides conclude that the
medium-range, land-based nuclear missiles they\'d stuffed across Europe
were simply too dangerous and destabilizing to be allowed. Because the
missiles could reach Moscow or Berlin or London at lightening speeds,
they shortened the \"response time\" to any crisis --- the window in
which a Soviet or Western leader would have to decide whether the
country was under attack before such an attack would hit --- to just a
few minutes. They made the danger of an unintended escalation, or of an
error like the that one Petrov only barely prevented, far greater. The
risk they posed was deemed, in the 1987 INF Treaty, unacceptable to the
world. And the weapons were removed. Putin has taken several steps to
push Europe back toward the nuclear brink, to the logic of nuclear
escalation and hair-trigger weapons that made the early 1980s, by many
accounts, the most dangerous time in human history. Perhaps most
drastically, he appears to have undone the 1987 INF Treaty,
reintroducing the long-banned nuclear weapons. In March, Russia
announced it would place nuclear-capable bombers and medium-range,
nuclear-capable Iskander missiles in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad
--- only an hour, by commercial airliner, from Berlin. Meanwhile, it has
been testing medium-range, land-based missiles. The missiles, to the
alarm of the United States, appear to violate the INF Treaty. This is
far from Putin\'s only nuclear escalation. He is developing more nuclear
weapons, and calling frequent attention to them, as apparent cover for
his aggression and adventurism in Europe. There are suspicions, for
example, that Russia may have deployed nuclear-armed submarines off of
the US Eastern Seaboard. What makes this so dangerous is that Putin
appears to believe, as the scholar Edward Lucas outlined in a recent
report for the Center for European Policy Analysis, that he has a
greater willingness than NATO to use nuclear weapons, and thus that his
superior will allows him to bully the otherwise stronger Western powers
with games of nuclear chicken. This is a substantial, and indeed
terrifying, break from Cold War--era nuclear thinking, in which both
sides rightly feared nuclear brinksmanship as too dangerous to
contemplate and used their weapons primarily to deter one another.
\"Russia's nuclear saber-rattling is unjustified, destabilizing and
dangerous,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a May
speech in Washington. Putin is acting out of an apparent belief that
increasing the nuclear threat to Europe, and as a result to his own
country, is ultimately good for Russia and worth the risks. It is a
gamble with the lives of hundreds of millions of Europeans, and perhaps
many beyond, at stake. X. The nuclear dangers: An atomic gun to the
world\'s head The view among many Western analysts is that the
nuclear-capable missiles are meant as a gun against the heads of the
Americans and the Europeans: You better not mess with us Russians, or
who knows what we\'ll do. Putin himself endorsed this view in a 2014
speech in Sochi, where he approvingly cited Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev\'s 1960 address to the United Nations, when he hammered his
shoe on the podium. \"The United States and NATO thought, \'This Nikita
is best left alone, he might just go and fire a missile. We better show
some respect for them,\'\" Putin said. This sort of a nuclear threat
could be a perfect way for Putin to attempt the sort of NATO-splitting
scenario described by analysts like Piontkovsky. What if, Lucas asked as
an example in his report, Putin found some excuse to declare a Russian
\"military exclusion zone\" in the Baltic Sea, thus physically cutting
off the Baltic states from the rest of NATO? \"Would America really risk
a nuclear standoff with Russia over a gas pipeline?\" Lucas asked. \"If
it would not, NATO is over. The nuclear bluff that sustained the Western
alliance through all the decades of the Cold War would have been called
at last.\" [Putin\'s love of brinksmanship, while perhaps born of
Russia\'s weakness, is]{.underline} also **[deeply
worrying]{.underline}** [for what it says about the leader\'s
willingness and even **eagerness**]{.underline} [to take on **huge
geopolitical risk**]{.underline}. \"Either [he has a very **weird
theory** of nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} he [just
**doesn't take the West seriously**]{.underline} and is trying to cow us
with whatever threat he can make,\" Saideman, the political scientist,
said, going on to draw yet another of the many parallels analysts have
drawn to the onset of World War I. \"There are two visions of
international relations: One is that threats work, and one is that
threats don't, where they cause counter-balancing,\" Saideman continued.
\"This was the theory of the \[German\] Kaiser before World War I: the
more threatening you are, the more people will submit to your will. That
might be Putin's logic, that he's just going to threaten and threaten
and hope that NATO bends. But the long run of international relations
suggests that it goes the other way, where the more threatening you are
the more you produce balancing.\" In other words, Putin is hoping to
compensate for his weakness by expressing his willingness to go further,
and to raise the stakes higher, than the more powerful Western nations.
But his actions are premised on a flawed understanding of how the world
works. In fact, he is virtually forcing the West to respond in kind,
raising not just the risk of a possible war, but the ease with which
such a war would go nuclear. XI. The nuclear dangers: Does Putin believe
nuclear war can be \"won\"? There is a corollary in Russia\'s nuclear
doctrine, a way in which the Russians believe they have solved the
problem of Western military superiority, that is so foolhardy, so
dangerous, that it is difficult to believe they really mean it. And yet,
there is every indication that they do. That corollary is Russia\'s
embrace of what it calls a \"de-escalation\" nuclear strike. Go back to
the scenario spelled out in Russia\'s military doctrine: a conventional
military conflict that poses an existential threat to the country. The
doctrine calls for Russia to respond with a nuclear strike. But imagine
you\'re a Russian leader: [How do you drop a nuclear bomb]{.underline}
on NATO\'s troops [without forcing the US to **respond with a nuclear
strike**]{.underline} in kind, [setting off a **tit-for-tat cycle** of
escalation that would end in **total nuclear war** and **global
devastation**?]{.underline} Russia\'s answer, in the case of such a
conflict, is to drop a single nuclear weapon --- one from the family of
smaller, battlefield-use nukes known as \"tactical\" weapons, rather
than from the larger, city-destroying \"strategic\" nuclear weapons. The
idea is that such a strike would signal Russia\'s willingness to use
nuclear weapons, and would force the enemy to immediately end the fight
rather than risk further nuclear destruction. Nikolai Sokov, a nuclear
weapons expert and former official in the Russian Foreign Affairs
Ministry, explained in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists that this is
not a far-fetched option of last resort; it has become central to
Russian war planning. \"Such a threat is envisioned as deterring the
United States and its allies from involvement in conflicts in which
Russia has an important stake, and in this sense is essentially
defensive,\" Sokov wrote. \"Yet, to be effective, such a threat also
must be credible. To that end, all large-scale military exercises that
Russia conducted beginning in 2000 featured simulations of limited
nuclear strikes.\" Buzhinsky, the recently retired member of Russia\'s
General Staff, confirmed in our meeting that this is something the
military sees as a viable option. \"If Russia is heavily attacked
conventionally, yes, of course, as it\'s written in the doctrine, there
may be limited use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons,\" he said. \"To show
intention, as a de-escalating factor.\" [It is difficult to imagine a
more **dangerous idea**]{.underline} in the world of military planning
today [than of a \"limited\" nuclear war]{.underline}. Scholars have
debated for decades, and still debate today, whether the concept of
limited nuclear war is realistic, or whether such a conflict would
inevitably spiral into total nuclear war. Put another way, [no one knows
for sure whether Russia\'s military planners have sown the seeds for
global nuclear destruction]{.underline}. Seen from the Russian side, it
is at least possible to imagine how this doctrine might make sense: The
threat of NATO\'s conventional forces is widely seen as both
overwhelming and imminent, making such an extreme step worth
considering. Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia\'s
strategic culture has increasingly emphasized its nuclear arsenal, the
one remaining legacy of its fearsome great-power status. It is a sort of
Russian cult of the nuclear weapon, or even a certain strategic fetish.
With nukes so central to Russian strategic thinking, it is little wonder
Moscow sees them as the solution to its greatest strategic problem. But
when you consider this doctrine from the American side, you begin to see
what makes it dangerous, even insane. Imagine that you are an American
leader and your forces in Eastern Europe have somehow been drawn into
conflict with the Russians. Perhaps, as artillery and planes from within
Russia hammer your forces, you counterattack on Russian soil to take
them out. The Kremlin, fearing the start of an invasion to take Moscow,
drops a tactical nuclear warhead on your forces in Estonia or Latvia.
You have no idea whether more Russian nuclear strikes are coming, either
on the battlefield, more widely on Europe, or even against Washington or
New York. Do you respond with an in-kind tactical nuclear strike,
opening the risk of gradual escalation to total nuclear war? Do you,
fearing the worst, move to take out the Russian leadership before they
can order more attacks? Or do you announce a unilateral ceasefire,
drawing your forces back in humiliation, rewarding Russia with a
victory? It is difficult to imagine a more dangerous idea than
\"limited\" nuclear war Russia\'s nuclear doctrine is betting that any
American leader --- not to mention the leaders of nuclear-armed France
and the UK --- would choose the last of those three options. If that
prediction turned out to be wrong, it would mean nuclear war, perhaps
global nuclear war and thus annihilation. This doctrine, in other words,
is gambling with the fate of the world. Such a scenario, to be clear, is
remote, as are all of the nuclear scenarios. It would require a
cascading series of events, and for neither side to pull back in time as
those events built. The odds of this happening are quite low. But they
are greater than zero, and growing. Such a scenario is within the realm
of possibility --- if it were not, then Russia would not regularly
conduct military exercises that imagine exactly this outcome. And recall
that Alexander Vershbow, the deputy secretary general of NATO, told a
conference in late April that NATO is gaming out exactly such a crisis.
There are yet more worrying implications to this Russian doctrine. Its
logical conclusion is that Russia sees itself as able to fight a war
with the conventionally superior United States without losing, and that
it can do this by using battlefield nuclear weapons. Under this
doctrine, Moscow is deeming not only full-blown war against the US as
imaginable, but a full-blown war with at least one nuclear detonation.
That, perhaps, can help explain why Putin has seemed so willing to
ratchet up the possibility of a real war with the United States, even
one involving nuclear threats --- he may believe that through his
superior will and brinksmanship, he can avoid defeat. Adding a nuclear
element to any conflict would also seem to increase the odds of NATO\'s
Western European members splitting over how to respond, particularly if
Russian propaganda can make the circumstances leading up to the
detonation unclear. But this also shows the degree to which his entire
strategy may rest in part on a shoddy premise --- that \"limited\"
nuclear war can be winnable --- and one that puts the entire world at
risk. XII. The nuclear dangers: End games President Dwight Eisenhower
held office at a time when the prospect of a nuclear war was relatively
new and military planners unsure how to account for the possibility of a
conflict with the Soviet Union in which both sides might use nuclear
weapons. Though some in his administration urged him to consider plans
for nuclear conflict, Eisenhower, no stranger to war, rejected the idea
as unthinkable. \"You just can\'t have this kind of war,\" Eisenhower
said in 1957. \"There aren\'t enough bulldozers to scrape the bodies off
the streets.\" Putin believes he has found a way around this problem,
relying on smaller, battlefield-use warheads that could win a war
without escalating to a global conflict in which whole cities were
sacrificed. But even a limited nuclear war could be catastrophic, and
not just for the nations where the bombs would fall, but for the whole
world. A 2008 study (updated in 2014) on the environmental effects of a
\"small\" nuclear war described what would happen if 100
Hiroshima-strength bombs were detonated in a hypothetical conflict
between India and Pakistan. This is equivalent to [less than **1
percent**]{.underline} [of the combined nuclear arsenals of the US and
Russia]{.underline}. The explosions, the study found, [would push a
layer of **hot, black smoke**]{.underline} [into the atmosphere, where
it would **envelop the Earth**]{.underline} in about 10 days. The study
predicted that [this]{.underline} smoke [would **block sunlight**,
**heat the atmosphere**]{.underline}, [and **erode the
ozone**]{.underline} for many years, [producing]{.underline} what the
researchers call without hyperbole \"[a **decade without
summer**]{.underline}.\" [As rains dried and crops failed]{.underline}
worldwide, the resulting global [famine would kill 1 billion
people]{.underline}. \"We escaped the Cold War without a nuclear
holocaust by some combination of skill, luck and divine intervention,
and I suspect the latter in greatest proportion,\" General George Lee
Butler of the US Strategic Air Command told the journalist Eric
Schlosser for his book on the dangers of nuclear weapons. We may have
escaped the Cold War, but we have not escaped the nuclear threat, which
not only remains but is growing. The sense that this danger is resigned
to history books, common in Washington and other Western capitals, is
precisely part of its danger. It is another echo of the months and years
before World War I, when the world drifted unknowingly toward disaster.
In April of last year, just after Russia had annexed Crimea, the
London-based think tank Chatham House published a report on the dangers
of unintended nuclear conflict. It was not pegged to the events in
Ukraine, and at that point few people, including the report\'s authors,
saw Crimea as the potential beginning of a larger conflict. Even still,
it was dire in its warnings. \"The probability of inadvertent nuclear
use is not zero and is higher than had been widely considered,\" it
stated. \"The risk associated with nuclear weapons is high\" and
\"under-appreciated.\" Their warnings were widely ignored. As the report
itself noted, the world has concluded, wrongly, that nuclear weapons no
longer pose an imminent threat. Attention has moved on. But the seeds of
a possible war are being sown in Europe. [Should the worst
happen]{.underline}, which is a remote but real possibility, [the
consequences will follow]{.underline} all Americans to their homes.

Cyber as a hybrid threat to, and enabler of, military operations [All
future **military confrontations** are expected to be **fought** with
cyber weapons. These **offensive cyber capabilities** in the hands of
**adversaries** pose a **significant threat** to the military forces and
**critical infrastructure** of NATO member states]{.underline}; and the
Alliance recognizes that cyber-attacks (as hybrid threats) can be as
damaging as conventional ones. This is because [malicious cyber
activities against computers that control physical processes can be as
dangerous]{.underline} as threats that are purely physical in nature and
could lead to explosions, **[nuclear meltdowns, blackouts, or financial
crises]{.underline}**. As put by NATO Secretary General, "[in just
minutes, a single cyberattack can inflict billions of dollars' worth of
damage]{.underline} to our economies, bring global companies to a
standstill, ~~paralyze~~ **[(destroy) our critical
infrastructure]{.underline}**, undermine our democracies and ~~cripple~~
**[(undermine) our military capabilities]{.underline}**".4 Over the past
decade, [Allies have identified a steep increase in cyber activities
targeting the critical infrastructure]{.underline} sectors [that NATO
military operations rely upon]{.underline}. Directly or indirectly,
these malicious cyber activities can also disrupt the Alliance's
logistics and forward operations. NATO's commitment to "operate and
defend itself "5 in the cyber domain as effectively as in the geographic
domains came, thus, as a direct recognition of cyber as a hybrid threat
to both the Allies and the Alliance. Compared to the air, land and sea
domains, [the cyber domain is not constrained by national
borders]{.underline} (although certain physical aspects of it might be
located within them). This distinction between the cyber and the
geographic domains is important to note, because NATO was founded in
response to external military threats without the right to intervene in
internal security matters, where member states maintain the monopoly
over the use of force. In the cyber domain, the distinction between
internal and external security threats is harder to ascertain. [When
integrating offensive cyber capabilities into its defence and deterrence
mandate]{.underline}, NATO would inevitably tackle certain aspects
inherent to internal security; and yet, not legally infringe on the
sovereignty of the Allies as long as effects amounting to force or
intervention are not employed against the physical systems residing in
these nations.6 [Operating in the cyber domain requires]{.underline},
thus, [that member states better integrate their offensive cyber
capabilities into NATO operations]{.underline} not just [**to win future
wars**, but also to avoid elements of friction between
Allies]{.underline}, which may arise from unilateral cyber effects to
defend critical infrastructure. NATO's adversaries in the cyber domain
Warfare in the cyber domain is already conducted against NATO member
states by both state and nonstate actors. It is also conducted by NATO
member states against these external threats. Within the Alliance,
however, offensive cyber effects are not yet part of the mission
planning process and [integration of national offensive cyber
capabilities into joint NATO operations is voluntary. Integrating these
national offensive cyber capabilities into NATO operations]{.underline},
thus [requires, not only a clear understanding of these
capabilities]{.underline}, but also agreement on the cyber threat
environment, characterized by the intent and capabilities of NATO's
current and/or potential future adversaries. State adversaries in the
cyber domain include [Russia, China and/or Iran. These are countries
known to be building offensive cyber capabilities specifically for the
purpose of using them against NATO member states]{.underline}.7 In
Russia's case, cyber attacks were conducted against the critical
infrastructure of NATO member states and partner nations, as for example
against US energy infrastructure in 2017 (including against a nuclear
powerplant near Burlington, Kansas)8 or against the Ukraine power grid
in December 2015. China has also been conducting persistent cyber
espionage using offensive cyber capabilities against core military and
critical infrastructure of NATO member states for years. For this
reason, the US Secretary of Defense, Mark T. Esper, remarked at the 2020
Munich Security Conference that the 5G Huawei infrastructure is a
serious threat to NATO.9 Lastly, Iran's offensive cyber capabilities
have also been observed during multiple attacks against the critical
infrastructure of NATO partner nations in the Middle East.

[**As Technospheric Breakdown Accelerates, Nuclear** Power Generation
**Mishaps will Increase and Intensify**]{.underline} There is really no
way around this eventuality. [As all the nuclear power plants age, they
will succumb to the **micro-stresses** which **inevitably** occur in
such **a**n ever-**deteriorating environment**. Most people are
**unaware** of the true depth and breadth of technospheric breakdown
since it is a concept **rarely taken up by academia** or the
media]{.underline}. The following excerpts provide a wider perspective
of [this unavoidable byproduct of the Industrial Revolution.
Technospheric breakdown is something that occurs **everywhere** around
the globe, **24/7**, without interruption, and with tremendous
repercussions]{.underline}. Let's start with [anything that has been
manufactured in the factories of the modern world or built on the
surface of the Earth.]{.underline} Simply put, everything [is in the
constant state of breaking down, degeneration,
deterioration.]{.underline} What does this really mean when we say that
every bridge is slowly breaking down, every road is in greater disrepair
with each passing day, every reservoir is gradually degrading, every
office building, every factory, every school, every home, etc. most of
which adhered to very low building standards in the first place? What
does it mean when [the infrastructure for every]{.underline} sewer
[system]{.underline}, municipal water division, electrical grid,
airport, railway station, etc. [is in a slow but sure process of
degrading and breaking down. So]{.underline}, unfortunately, [is **every
nuclear power plant across the planet**.]{.underline} (Cosmic
Convergence) [What makes this ongoing process of physical degradation so
insidious is that it almost always occurs **subliminally**]{.underline}.
Through a gathering array of various forces throughout post-modern
civilization, there does exist a sort of conspiracy of circumstances
which has greatly magnified the effects of technospheric breakdown. The
completed marriage between the industrial base of the Western powers and
the financial class throughout the world has guaranteed that this slow
motion collapse will continue unabated. How so? Because so many
corporate decisions are made according to their impact on the bottom
line, [many inferior nuclear power plants have been constructed around
the globe.]{.underline} Likewise, because the mega-banks and investment
houses are now dictating to a financially-strapped Nuclear Energy
Industry, [**substandard** nuclear **reactors** have been designed,
engineered and **continue to be** put **in**to **operation** across the
planet.]{.underline} One only has to take a close look at the websites
dedicated to decommissioned nuclear reactors or cold shutdowns or
partially closed nuclear power plants or emergency actions taken at
various nuclear power generation sites to grasp just how precarious a
position the entire industry is currently in. Unknown to even many of
the nuclear engineers who address these issues 'in the office', or who
fix the cascade of problems at nuke plants themselves, is the notion of
[slow motion, subclinical, pernicious technospheric
breakdown.]{.underline} It often [manifests in ways where cause and
effect cannot be easily established because of some of the unseen forces
produced by atomic fission.]{.underline} With that said, it should be
noted that a chapter could easily be dedicated to this particular issue
alone, so significant is it to the future of nuclear power generation
Then there is the problem of **[nuclear wastes]{.underline}** and
natural rights, yes? No one has articulated this point better than
Albert Bates in his definitive essay entitled The Karma of Kerma:
Nuclear Wastes and Natural Rights (Bates, A.K., 1988) This extremely
lucid and illuminating, sober and sane treatment of [the **greatest
ongoing environmental disaster** of our times]{.underline} lays bare the
most basic legal and human rights issues which [converge around the
production, treatment and storage of nuclear wastes.]{.underline} Were
the governments of the world to read and take to heart its simple and
straightforward thesis, the current incarnation of nuclear energy
production would have been abandoned years ago: [The disposal of
radioactive substances in a manner that anticipates their eventual
partial release into the human environment imposes a **health burden**
upon **future generations** that **cannot be justified**]{.underline} by
any moral or legal rationale. Like an irresistible force meeting an
immovable object, the concept of the greater good for the many in the
present generation runs against the concept of the inalienable rights of
each individual in future eras. At present, in matters involving nuclear
power, our governmental agencies have taken the side of the irresistible
force. But when federal agencies venture to tread beyond of the scope of
the foundation principles with which the federal government was
fashioned, they endanger more than human lives. At risk in the nuclear
waste debate are long-held concepts of ordered liberty. (Bates A. K.,
1988) Fukushima has illustrated exactly why this elegantly stated legal
concept of human rights and moral imperative is so pertinent to the
public discourse. [When massive amounts of radioactive wastewater are
dumped into the Pacific Ocean, not only **human life** will be adversely
affected. Marine life has been negatively impacted in ways that will
take decades to observe and comprehend.]{.underline} The outright
destruction of the environment in and around Fukushima and the Pacific
Ocean must also be considered in any meaningful assessment of collateral
damage. Perhaps even more than Chernobyl, [Fukushima has allowed the
global community to view the whole event]{.underline} through the lens
of legal responsibility and ethical outcomes [so that new international
standards can be written and implemented]{.underline} regarding nuclear
waste conveyance and disposal. If nothing else, this discussion has
raised awareness about the most nagging issue concerning the NEP.
Whereas the human rights aspect confers the legal right to not be
contaminated by nuclear radiation has barely been addressed by those
responsible for it consequences, it now enjoys a prominent place
throughout the worldwide debate. [Accidents and mishaps, manmade and
natural disasters happen.]{.underline} Things are fixed fairly quickly
in this postmodern age, and life goes on. Whether these events occur in
a full-blown war zone or in the wake of a hurricane, the affected
population usually does everything it can to rebuild and move on.
[However, when these events take place in or near nuclear power plants,
**life** doesn't just go on. It often **stops**]{.underline}. Depending
on the circumstances and seriousness of a nuclear event, [sometimes life
stops in that area for a long time. Our **civilization**
has]{.underline} now [been given]{.underline} three unmistakable
**[wakeup calls]{.underline}** since the advent of the nuclear power
generation era. First there was [Three Mile Island]{.underline} in
Pennsylvania, then there was [Chernobyl]{.underline} in the Ukraine, and
lastly the world is still reeling from the specter of possibilities
which are presented by [Fukushima]{.underline}. Surely [it is not by
chance that these three flagrant examples of nuclear Perfect Storms
occurred around the globe affecting major nations and populations
centers]{.underline}. Each of these disasters has served to wake up
whole swaths of humanity to the dangers and risks which are associated
with the current Nuclear Energy Paradigm. To ignore, or deny, or refute
the obvious lessons which all three nuclear catastrophes have given to
humankind would be folly of the highest order. [The **global impact** of
Fukushima, which has disseminated radionuclides (radioactive
contaminants) by air and by way of the largest of the seven seas, stands
as dramatic testimony to all that can go wrong]{.underline} ---
seriously wrong --- with the current nuclear energy business model and
method of power generation. [**Can it get any worse** than Fukushima?
That we are compelled to even ask this question speaks volumes about the
true state of the affairs]{.underline} on that 25 square mile patch of
land and contiguous sea which surround the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
disaster site. Given this inescapable testament of nuclear folly, it is
now incumbent upon the community of nations to rally around the obvious
necessity of terminating the current form of the Nuclear Energy
Paradigm. Why? Because when a "China Syndrome" occurs anywhere in the
world, **[it will inevitably affect the entire planet]{.underline}**. In
other words, an INES Level 7 (Wikipedia, International Nuclear Event
Scale) [nuclear catastrophe does not respect borders. Nor does it
discriminate between the young and old, healthy and sick, or those who
live close to ground zero from those who live far away.]{.underline}
Therefore, any nation that chooses to set up a nuclear energy-producing
operation from this point forward has an inviolable responsibility to
its neighbors, as it does to the rest of the world. Likewise, those
[nations have a moral obligation to proceed in a manner that guarantees
its neighbors will not be exposed to the consequences of its nuclear
accidents, even when they are caused by duel **natural disaster** events
as we saw at Fukushima.]{.underline} Just as Europe was contaminated
with radiation from Chernobyl (Yablokov, A.V., 2009), and North America
has been contaminated from Fukushima, it is understood that [once a
nuclear catastrophe spirals out of control, the genie of radioactive
**contamination cannot be put back in the bottle**.]{.underline} The
entire Pacific Rim, in fact, has varying degrees of exposure to the
radioactive waste water being conveyed by the ocean from Fukushima, as
does the Western Hemisphere to seaborne radioactive isotopes like
Cesium-137 and airborne isotopes such as Iodine-131(Center for Marine
and Environmental Radiation). Consequently, Japan is responsible for the
damage wrought to the largest ocean on Earth. Have they acknowledged
this? Have they approached the nations both near and far which have been
affected by their cavalier and irresponsible approach to siting reactors
up and down their seismic shorelines? Has the United Nations even
addressed this extremely important issue known as national
accountability? Or territorial sovereignty? Conclusion It doesn't get
very much more weighty than the 'fallout from Fukushima'. All of the
affected nations have been curiously silent on this issue. It is almost
as though a conspiracy of silence has descended upon the concerned
countries because of how unpredictable and intractable the nuclear
containment problems have been at the Daiichi plant. At the end of the
day [the current race of **humanity** will look back on the Fukushima
Nuclear Disaster as the **defining moment**]{.underline} for both the
industry and the underlying paradigm. If they haven't already, the
[various stakeholders will be forced to re-evaluate the integrity of
their nuclear enterprises]{.underline} around the globe. [**Hopefully**,
they will begin to take aggressive **preemptive measures** to address
whatever needs to be addressed at every nuclear site still in
operation.]{.underline} [If a **decisive response** is not
formulated]{.underline} and implemented on a global scale, in light of
the hard lessons learned from Fukushima, [the current planetary
**civilization** will be compelled to face up to these **fatal flaws**
in most unpleasant ways, which will continue to manifest with each major
Earth change.]{.underline} In a similar way, the inherent
[defects]{.underline} of the NEP [will only be accentuated as
technospheric breakdown accelerates.]{.underline} The profound and
fundamental shortcomings which pervade the entire nuclear energy
industry can no longer be hidden or ignored. After all, it was the
dangerous combination of willful blindness and feigned ignorance which
got the world into this position in the first place. "[Does anyone in
their right mind believe that nuclear power plants can ever be designed,
engineered or constructed to withstand 9.0 earthquakes followed by 15
meter high tsunamis?]{.underline} Sorry if we offend, but such a display
of so deadly a combination of ignorance and arrogance must represent the
very height of hubris. Particularly in view of the inevitable
consequences which have manifested at Fukushima, how is it that so few
saw this pre-ordained and disastrous outcome, except by willful
blindness?"

**So does grid collapse.**

Consequences of a sustained power outage The EMP Commission states
"[Should significant parts of the electrical power infrastructure be
lost for any substantial period of time]{.underline}, the Commission
believes that the **[consequences are likely to be
catastrophic]{.underline}**, and many [people will die for the lack of
the basic elements necessary to sustain life]{.underline} in dense urban
and suburban communities." \[67\]. Space constraints preclude discussion
on how the [loss of the grid would render **synthesis** and
**distribution of oil and gas inoperative**. **Telecommunications**
would **collapse**, as would **finance** and **banking**. **Virtually
all technology**, **infrastructure**, and **services** require
electricity.]{.underline} An EMP [attack]{.underline} that collapses the
electric power grid [will **collapse the water
infrastructure**]{.underline}---the delivery and purification of water
and the removal and treatment of wastewater and sewage. Outbreaks that
would result from the failure of these systems include cholera. It is
problematic if fuel will be available to boil water. [Lack of water will
cause death in **3 to 4 days**]{.underline} \[68\]. [**Food production
would also collapse**. Crops and livestock require water delivered by
electronically powered pumps.]{.underline} Tractors, harvesters, and
other farm equipment run on petroleum products supplied by an
infrastructure (pumps, pipelines) that require electricity. The [plants
that make fertilizer, insecticides, and feed also require
electricity.]{.underline} Gas pumps that fuel the trucks that distribute
food require electricity. [Food processing requires
electricity.]{.underline} In 1900, nearly 40% of the population lived on
farms. That percentage is now less than 2% \[69\]. [**It is through
technology** that **2% of the population can feed the other
98%**]{.underline} \[68\]. The acreage under cultivation today is only
6% more than in 1900, yet productivity has increased 50 fold \[69\]. As
stated by Dr. Lowell L Wood in Congressional testimony: "If we were no
longer able to fuel our agricultural machine in the country, the [food
production]{.underline} of the country [would simply stop]{.underline},
because we do not have the horses and mules that used to tow
agricultural gear around in the 1880s and 1890s". "So the situation
would be exceedingly adverse if both electricity and the fuel that
electricity moves around the country......... stayed away for a
substantial period of time, we would miss the harvest, and **[we would
starve the following winter]{.underline}**" \[70\]. People can live for
1--2 months without food, but after 5 days, they have difficulty
thinking and at 2 weeks they are incapacitated \[68\]. There is
typically a 30-day perishable food supply at regional warehouses but
most would be destroyed with the loss of refrigeration \[69\]. The EMP
Commission has suggested food be stockpiled for a possible EMP event. A
prescription for failure [Even if all the recommendations]{.underline}
of the Congressional EMP Commission [were implemented, there is **no
guarantee that the grid will not sustain a prolonged collapse**. There
should therefore be **contingency plans** for such a
failure.]{.underline} There is also another consideration. The
[foundational pillars of prior American nuclear defense
policy]{.underline}, in today's climate, [are of uncertain validity.
**M**utual **a**ssured **d**estruction is the **Maginot line** of the
21st century.]{.underline} Nonproliferation will prove difficult to
resurrect. The [consequences of a **widespread nuclear attack** have
been positioned to the public as massive deaths from blast
effects]{.underline}, and then further lingering deaths from the effects
of radiation. We suspect there will be no electricity, and [there will
be no electricity for a **very long time**. There should be an
actionable plan]{.underline} in anticipation of a possible prolonged
collapse of the grid---a retro-structure and a skill [set to provide a
**framework for survival**. Our sense is **there is no
plan**.]{.underline}

[Cyber defence has become a central component of NATO
planning]{.underline}, given the success of Russia and others in
compromising NATO networks. US intelligence sources assess that any
unclassified NATO network that is directly connected to the internet
should be considered potentially compromised and that cyber espionage is
the principle threat to NATO systems over the next three years. They
also assess that Russia, given its record of effective cyber collection,
poses the greatest espionage threat to NATO computer networks.3 The
vulnerable state of many NATO members' national networks makes defence a
priority, but it cannot be the only priority. Discussion within NATO has
focused on a defensive role and on the issue of when a cyber incident
could trigger the collective defence provision of Article 5 of the North
Atlantic Treaty. NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC),
co-located with Allied Command Operations (ACO), is responsible for
defending NATO networks. NATO is improving its cyber defence and helping
member states improve their own cyber defences through information
sharing, training, and if necessary, the deployment of rapid reaction
cyber defence teams. **[These topics are essential]{.underline}** for
planning purposes, but leave NATO in a reactive mode when it comes to
cyber warfare.4 **[The central question for NATO]{.underline}**'s cyber
doctrine [is how the **lack of an articulated**]{.underline} offensive
[**cyber capability** affects its ability to deter or
defend]{.underline}. Put another way, **[can any military force credibly
claim to have advanced capabilities if it does not
include]{.underline}** offensive [cyber operations]{.underline} in its
arsenal? Offensive capabilities, unlike NATO's current defensive
posture, involve deliberate intrusions into opponent networks or systems
with the intention of causing disruption, damage or destruction. [The
question]{.underline} of NATO and offensive cyber capabilities [touches
on a **range of sensitive political issues**]{.underline} that militate
against any change in policy in the near term. [The US has always been
**overly secretive** about its]{.underline} offensive **[cyber
capabilities]{.underline}**, [even after a flood of media leaks have
made the most sensitive doctrine publicly available]{.underline}. [This
secrecy has carried over into NATO, and is unhelpful in that it
increases the likelihood of opponents miscalculating]{.underline} as
they consider the risks of using force or coercion against NATO members
or interests. [A lack of public discourse on offensive cyber operations
undercuts]{.underline} the **[legitimacy of NATO
operations]{.underline}** **[by failing to build public
understanding]{.underline}**, [and leaves NATO open to charges of
sinister plots,]{.underline} since **[denial of offensive capabilities
is not credible]{.underline}** when two NATO members are world leaders
in cyber operations. Parallels between cyber operations and nuclear
strategy are usually misleading, but cannot always be dismissed. The
parallel for NATO is that [cyber attack is a "weapon" with both
strategic and tactical uses, which only a few NATO members
possess.]{.underline} Unlike nuclear weapons, however, the [procedures
for integrating]{.underline} offensive [cyber operations]{.underline}
into NATO's defensive actions **[are not at all obvious]{.underline}**,
if they exist. NATO will need to describe how the cyber capabilities
possessed by a few of its members will support NATO's defensive
activities, and **[NATO's credibility]{.underline}** in defence
**[requires]{.underline}** some [public discussion on the use
of]{.underline} offensive **[cyber operations.]{.underline}** There has
been a confusing debate over the merits of cyber deterrence, but one
conclusion that we can draw from this discussion is that both the
contribution of cyber operations to deterrence and the ability to deter
cyber attack work best when embedded in a larger military force
structure. Adding offensive cyber capabilities to NATO's force structure
and response doctrine will increase its deterrent capabilities -- by how
much is unclear, [but what is clear is that a failure to add cyber
capabilities will erode a credible deterrent as cyber operations are
increasingly embedded into military operations.5]{.underline} Beyond
deterrence, two other factors point to the need for additional
consideration of NATO's public posture on offensive cyber operations.
The first is that [cyber techniques are essential for the kinds of
combat operations that NATO forces may carry out in the
future]{.underline}. No modern air force would enter into combat without
electronic warfare (EW) capabilities; as cyber and EW merge into a
single activity, air operations will require cyber support. The same is
true for special forces operations. Offensive cyber capabilities will
shape the battlefields of the future. Second, [NATO's **potential
opponents** will use **cyber techniques** in new ways]{.underline}, in
what some have called "hybrid warfare".6 These include countries
traditionally of concern to NATO, but cyber threats could also come from
new actors, such as Iran or North Korea, and proxy or non-state actors
such as the Syrian Electronic Army. These nations and groups, using
cyber techniques, now have new ways to strike NATO countries. [Military
doctrine is **changing** as opponents seek to **circumvent** US military
power]{.underline} and use a blend of political action and "influence
operations", special forces, proxies and irregular units, unconventional
tactics and cyber techniques to apply force to gain their ends. Cyber
techniques for political action and "influence operations" are not
intended to destroy or disrupt, but rather to put coercive political
pressure on targets. [This new style of warfare will **challenge
planning for mutual defence**]{.underline}. For these reasons, the need
for more than defensive or technical cyber capabilities will increase.7

### 1AC \-\-- Adv \-\-- Cohesion

#### Advantage two is [COHESION]{.underline}:

#### Diverging OCO policies between NATO members undermines alliance commitments 

Max **Smeets**, 8-6-20**21**, \[Senior Researcher at the Center for
Security Studies, \"NATO allies' offensive cyber policy: A growing
divide?\", The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies,
https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/\]

[Member states agree on the critical need for a coherent cyber
policy]{.underline}. [Almost all NATO allies have developed]{.underline}
both [a cyber security strategy]{.underline} and a cyber defense
strategy.\[1\] Some states have published updated versions over the
years to reaffirm cyber security as an issue of national security
importance, to tweak institutional responsibilities, or to articulate
changes in the threat landscape. In addition, since 2018, [most NATO
allies have established a military cyber organization]{.underline}
(either a command or unit) with a mandate to conduct cyber effect
operations -- that is, cyber operations [intended to disrupt, deny,
degrade and/or destroy]{.underline}.\[2\] There is also shared
recognition that international law applies in cyberspace, although
allies have yet to spell out the legal procedures for operating in this
new "domain of warfare."

[These developments have been both reflected in]{.underline}, [and aided
by]{.underline}, [policy progress made at the inter-governmental
level]{.underline}. At the Prague Summit in 2002, NATO for the first
time recognized that the Alliance should "Strengthen our capabilities to
defend against cyber attacks."\[3\] In 2008, at the Bucharest Summit,
there was another milestone development, when NATO adopted a "Policy on
Cyber Defense," aiming to "protect key information systems in accordance
with their respective responsibilities; share best practices; and
provide a capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter
a cyber attack."\[4\] In the same year, the Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence -- a NATO accredited international research
institution -- was established in Tallinn, Estonia. In 2016, at the
Warsaw Summit, cyberspace was officially recognized as a "domain of
operations" and allies made a Cyber Defense Pledge to enhance their
cyber defenses.\[5\] The 2018 Brussels Summit and 2020 London Summit
reiterated NATO's commitment to implement the Cyber Defense Pledge and
operationalize the Cyber Operations Center, responsible for situational
awareness and the centralized planning of cyber operations and
missions.\[6\] In January 2020, the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace
Operations was published "to plan, execute and assess cyberspace
operations (CO) in the context of allied joint operations."\[7\]

Steady divergence

[Yet when it comes to the direction of allies' cyber
policy]{.underline}, [growing differences are apparent]{.underline} --
**[especially in]{.underline}** the development and deployment
**[offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}**. First, even though most
states now have -- or are in the process of -- establishing a cyber
command, [operational capabilities vastly differ across
states]{.underline}. [Whereas some governments are increasingly
allocating significant resources to conduct cyber
operations]{.underline} -- and are now starting to benefit from these
investments -- [the majority of allies still run their cyber commands on
a budget of a few million a year]{.underline} --an amount that is
insufficient for effective operations in the cyber domain.

Secondly, [until a few years ago]{.underline}, [NATO members' strategic
visions were largely aligned]{.underline}. National cyber strategies
shared a common threat focus on operations that could potentially cause
major societal havoc, such as taking down the power grid. [Allies'
national strategies were]{.underline} also largely [unified in their
vision to address]{.underline} this threat, discussing [the need for
deterrence]{.underline}, [resilience]{.underline}, [and
norms]{.underline}. However, [this changed with the publication of
the]{.underline} US [D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f
[D]{.underline}efense['s strategy on Defend Forward and US Cyber
Command's vision on Persistent Engagement]{.underline}.\[8\] [The United
States emphasizes the need to cause friction]{.underline} "[wherever the
adversary maneuvers]{.underline}," **[operating]{.underline}**
"globally, continuously and seamlessly" (potentially) **[below the
threshold of armed attack]{.underline}**. "We must...maneuver seamlessly
across the interconnected battlespace, globally, as close as possible to
adversaries and their operations, and continuously shape the battlespace
to create operational advantage for us while denying the same to our
adversaries," in the words of NSA director and Cyber Command head Gen.
Paul Nakasone.\[9\] Whereas deterrence is about changing your
adversary's cost-benefit calculus, Persistent Engagement is about taking
the opportunity away from the adversary to act.\[10\]

Third, [NATO member positions on how international law
applies]{.underline} -- [particularly the obligations of states
vis-a-vis sovereignty]{.underline} -- [are now more divergent than a
decade ago]{.underline}. Whereas countries like the Netherlands and
France are located on the side of the "sovereignty as a rule" camp, the
United Kingdom has taken the position that a remote cyber operation by
one state into another's cyber systems or network does not violate the
latter's sovereignty.

Where to go from here?

[The divergence in cyber policy across NATO member states is
problematic]{.underline}. [Allies disagree on both the goals of cyber
policy and the ways and means to achieve them]{.underline}. This can
**[cause tension between allies]{.underline}**, [especially when it
comes to the necessity and legitimacy of operating on each
other's]{.underline} national systems and [networks]{.underline}.

Some may argue that these differences result from differences in
maturity. Some states simply have not caught up with the latest
developments, goes the argument. This assumes a single path to cyber
maturity or that the dynamics of cyberspace pull all states in the same
direction. It suggests that -- even without major policy coordination --
allies' cyber policies will converge over time. But a more persuasive
understanding of the current trend is that even though [states can learn
from each other's institutional progress]{.underline}, [differences do
not merely stem from states]{.underline} "[lagging behind]{.underline}."
[These states are on a different policy path]{.underline}. This means
**[it requires dedicated and sustained policy attention
to]{.underline}**, at a minimum, **[coordinat]{.underline}**ing the
different **[policies]{.underline}** of states -- [and]{.underline}
potentially [bring them closer together]{.underline}.

NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction [teams are already equipped to conduct
defensive cyber operations]{.underline} in support of member states if
called upon[. A mandate of cyber defence and security implies, however,
that NATO also starts to engage in active military measures to deny,
degrade, disrupt, deceive, or destroy an adversary's offensive cyber
capabilities. This requires the development of]{.underline} not only
**[offensive cyber A2/AD capabilities by Allies]{.underline}**, but also
the restructuring of the NATO command structures, policies, processes
(procurement, intelligence, operations, etc.) and engagements needed to
integrate them by the Alliance. **[NATO coordination]{.underline}** with
both national and regional entities charged with cyber security aspects
[**will, in particular, need to be enhanced**. Many agreements already
exist in the realm of defensive cyber]{.underline} at national and
regional levels (as seen with the 2016 NATO-EU Technical Arrangement on
Cyber Defence), [but **political consensus among Allies is missing** on
whether they should be expanded to incorporate]{.underline} the
collective **[use of offensive cyber]{.underline}** A2/AD capabilities.
Conclusion [The lack of integrated offensive cyber]{.underline} A2/AD
[capabilities **undermines both the unity of the Alliance and its
mandate of defence**]{.underline} and deterrence. On the former, the
[lack of coordination between Allies during unilateral cyber operations
could lead to friction when resulting effects infringe on Allied
cyber-physical infrastructures. It could also lead to cyber fratricide,
when failure to properly attribute Allied digital personas occurs during
these military operations.]{.underline} On the latter, while [most
Allies are **developing offensive cyber capabilities**]{.underline},
some remain unable to face the growing number of cyber threats
unilaterally. [Successful defence and deterrence in the cyber domain
calls, thus, for]{.underline} ready collective [offensive cyber A2/AD
capabilities]{.underline} that, when **[integrated with NATO
operations]{.underline}**, would complement national and/ or regional
responses to malicious cyber activities. If and when this integration
occurs, NATO Flexible Deterrence Options would also need to be agreed
upon in order to [signal cyber adversaries that Allies will respond with
**one voice**]{.underline} if attacked in the cyber domain. Ultimately,
[political consensus within the Alliance]{.underline} would still need
to be **[built on]{.underline}** the type of needed collective
[offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline} (such as for A2/ AD purposes)
[and on how to **integrate them**]{.underline} into NATO's existing
operations and missions.

contribute to joint action against a presumably well-armed foreign
aggressor. **[States including the United States]{.underline}**, the
United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Estonia, and Denmark [have publicly
declared their willingness to lend sovereign offensive]{.underline}
[cyber effects to deter, defend against and counter the full spectrum of
threats. Sharing intelligence and information is a key element of NATO's
core decision-making process **enshrined in Article 4**]{.underline} of
the Washington Treaty. [Political consultations are part of the
preventive diplomacy between member states]{.underline}, but they are
also an avenue to discuss concerns related to the security threats
member states face. [These consultations can be a catalyst for
**reaching a consensus on policies**]{.underline} to be adopted or
actions to be taken---including those on the use of sovereign cyber
effects to support a NATO operation. The alliance has a track record of
collective action and cooperative security measures. For example,
Operation Active Endeavour helped to deter, disrupt and protect against
terrorist activity in the Mediterranean in the aftermath of the 9/11
terrorist attacks, in solidarity with the United States. For the seventh
time, the Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative will be among
the organizations privileged to organize an event on the sidelines of
the Feb. 15--17 [Munich Security

This year in particular, the Atlantic Council's event, "Defending Human
Dignity: Limiting Malicious Cyber Activity Through Diplomacy," will
complement the topics high on the agenda of the main conference, such as
transatlantic collaboration, the consequences of a resurgence of great
power competition and the future of arms control. In the United States,
[the greatest failures of response and deterrence]{.underline} to
foreign aggression in cyberspace have not been caused by a lack of
intelligence, capability or imagination. Rather, [U.S. policy has been
serviceable in theory but impotent in practice because of an inability
to translate]{.underline} technical findings and **[intelligence into
public support]{.underline}** for sufficiently tough responses ordered
by elected political leaders. North Korea's repeated operations
targeting U.S. companies and critical infrastructure have been met with
public skepticism over their culpability, limiting the strength of
retaliatory options needed to deter further events. Chinese cyber
economic espionage continued for years despite widespread knowledge of
China's activities because political leaders found it difficult to
confront Beijing without undermining U.S. companies in return. Russian
information operations did not sow enough doubt to mislead experts, but
they succeeded in exacerbating the partisan polarization of an
already-divided electorate and its leaders. That inability to translate
the findings of cyber experts into public sentiment and therefore
political action has sidelined America's cyberwarriors, by far the most
technologically advanced and well-resourced in the world. Imagine the
political response of an ally that is asked to burden-share in response
to cyber aggression but is probably much closer to any resulting kinetic
fight than the United States. Now [imagine the response of]{.underline}
that [ally when it's being asked to take causus belli on faith: The
United States is presenting attribution for a cyberattack elsewhere in
the world, but perhaps is depending on the ally lacking critical details
due to classification, and is presenting that information alongside a
request for help that might well put the ally in the crosshairs of its
own cyberattack]{.underline} or lethal action. **[How can
allies]{.underline}** with different capabilities to collect, analyze
and understand intelligence [be part of a consensus on
using]{.underline} sovereign **[cyber effects]{.underline}** to support
a NATO operation? [How can a commander **achieve a common operational
picture** to authorize the use of sovereign effects in a NATO operation
if all the allies are not on the same page]{.underline} with respect to
critical attribution and other technical information needed for a use of
effect in an operation? We all know what a tank looks like on a shared
satellite image, but if you ask three cyber experts to interpret the
attribution for a set of indicators, you are likely to get at least four
answers. [For most U.S. allies]{.underline} in Europe and elsewhere,
[there is simply a dearth of technical know-how within the government
when it comes to cyber]{.underline} attribution and
**[operations]{.underline}**. This is already a
[challenge](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2015/04/fierce-battle-cyber-talent-even-nsa-struggles-keep-elites-staff/110158/)
for the United States, with a massive defense budget, Silicon Valley
innovation and an educated workforce to pull into [government
service](https://www.usds.gov/). But for many U.S. allies, tech-savvy
public servants will have long fled for the private sector,
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and academia before reaching
ministerial positions. To its credit, the U.S. National Cyber Strategy
does propose capacity-building measures to support allies. This means
building up law enforcement, intelligence, and military operational and
investigative capability. But even with successful capacity-building
programs, many nations could, in a crisis, end up in the same place the
United States is---with good options stuck on the shelf while political
leaders and their electorates lack a critical mass of informed voters to
trust, understand and act on expert findings. [For countries weighing
whether to risk their own blood and treasure in support of an ally's
cyber]{.underline} attribution findings, this **[hurdle could well prove
insurmountable]{.underline}** if not addressed well before a crisis
emerges. Many such [countries will no doubt recall being burned when
placing too much confidence in U.S.]{.underline} technical and human
sources without an **[ability]{.underline}** to evaluate the evidence
for themselves, as with the Iraq weapons of mass destruction findings.
The private sector will probably play a crucial role in providing
intelligence to support alliance responses to cyberattacks, especially
as a stopgap over the next few years. FireEye and its peer competitors
and partners regularly produce analyses of major world cyber
events---many that fly below the radar of Western leadership, in
fact---sometimes at a near-government quality and often covering much of
the same "classified" evidence. More important, private-sector analysts
are accustomed to writing for impact with both their technical
counterparts, like chief information security officers (CISOs) and
threat hunters, and nontechnical stakeholders such as boards of
directors, CEOs and other persons controlling the purse strings. In this
sense, unclassified, private-sector and NGO-driven cyber threat
intelligence can become the lingua franca of discussions. Relying on
commercial reporting generated by international teams, rather than
declassified government-generated reports, both broadens the audience
enough to make alliance discussions feasible and mitigates against
disparities in terminology across national lines---the tendency of even
closely integrated allies to describe cyber "attack," "information
operations," and attribution findings with different implicit
assumptions or implications. Long-Term Thinking In the long run, though,
**[the U.S.]{.underline}** and its more technologically advanced
allies---such as its fellow Five Eyes (Australia, Canada, New Zealand
and the U.K.), France and Japan---[will have to make important policy
changes in the interests of **furthering alliance
cooperation**]{.underline} in cyberspace: [a willingness to sometimes
risk sensitive sources and methods in order to get cyber threat
intelligence into the hands of other countries better positioned to take
policy action]{.underline}, an end to classifying public information
like IP addresses solely because of their acquisition via classified
means, [and greater transparency]{.underline} on their own
decision-making. Government cyber leaders within the alliance should
consider taking another page out of the private-sector playbook as well:
running cyber-crisis exercises that involve more than the IT department.
In the commercial world, the more successful practice runs involve
leaders at both the CISO level and some presence from nontechnical teams
that would weigh in during a crisis, such as communications and legal.
The best exercises involve executives, too, who despite their busy
schedules must see for themselves how their companies would survive and
respond during a potentially ruinous cyberattack, and work through the
minutiae of leading a response themselves. The experience and confidence
is invaluable if ever called on during a real-life crisis, and the
organizational introspection by involving decision-makers at all levels
is irreplaceable. Military-to-military cyber training as part of
cross-country force standardization and joint operational planning could
pull in more senior national leadership, beyond battlefield commanders,
and be coupled with increased funding for foreign affairs-led training
for nontechnical leaders. The private sector could also meaningfully
contribute during NATO consultations when developing Allied Joint
Publications to make sure that definitions and requirements for threat
intelligence incorporate the best practices of NATO member countries'
private sectors. [If a U.S. diplomat reaches out to]{.underline} his or
her [counterpart in an allied country to ask for assistance]{.underline}
responding to malware that's damaging critical infrastructure, [and that
counterpart has to ask what malware is, the **response isn't going to
happen**]{.underline}**.** [NATO's essential and enduring purpose is to
safeguard]{.underline} the freedom and **[security of all its
members]{.underline}** by political and military means. [Tolerating
cyberattacks,]{.underline} especially those deliberately targeting
civilians and the political legitimacy of governments---[without the
alliance having the capability to **jointly discuss**]{.underline}
attribution **[and have the confidence to act and assist one
another]{.underline}**---**[undermines this core purpose of the
alliance]{.underline}**. Likewise, pursuing only deterrence and response

responsibilities]{.underline}** to their citizens but is impossible
without a common language and operational picture to discuss enforcement
of such agreements. The U.S. is stronger with allies, and with attention
to these issues its cybersecurity can be too.

Benefits and the creation of partnerships The [strategy of persistent
engagement and defend forward can help less capable cyber actors defend
themselves]{.underline} against adversaries. Both the U.S. Cyber Command
vision and the DoD cyber strategy [stress the importance of working
closely with **international**]{.underline} and private sector
**[partners]{.underline}** to successfully operate in cyberspace.xxix
The DoD strategy states the following: "Our strategic approach is based
on mutually reinforcing lines of effort to build a more lethal force;
compete and deter in cyberspace; expand alliances and partnerships;
reform the Department; and cultivate talent." xxx On international
partnerships, it more explicitly states: "Many of [the United States'
allies and partners possess advanced cyber capabilities that complement
our own]{.underline}. The Department will [work to strengthen the
capacity of these allies and partners]{.underline} and increase DoD's
ability [to leverage its partners' unique skills, resources,
capabilities]{.underline}, and perspectives. **[Information-sharing
relationships with allies and partners will increase]{.underline}** the
**[effectiveness of combined cyberspace operations]{.underline}** and
enhance our collective cybersecurity posture." xxxi The United States
has also signed several memoranda of understanding and over the years
addressed cyber cooperation in some way, shape or form. In 2008, a MoU
was signed between the Department of Defense and the German Federal
Ministry of Defence about computer network defense and information
assurance.xxxii A year later, a similar MoU on computer network defense
was signed with South-Korea. xxxiii More recently, the Cyber Command
worked alongside Montenegrin cyber defenders with as aim "to increase
interoperability, build partner capability, and deter malign influence
on the democratic processes of our allies, partners and the U.S." xxxiv
It was reported that U.S. Cyber Command personnel operated in the
networks of Ukraine and Macedonia as well to help those countries defend
against malicious cyber activity.xxxv At the 2019 Cyber Command
symposium, specific examples were discussed on how cooperation can also
help in not just detecting or deterring adversaries but also cause
friction in their operational activity.xxxvi For example, the U.S. might
upload foreign APT malware samples on VirusTotal, an online malware
repository and file scanning service, forcing adversaries to go back to
the drawing broad and adapt.xxxvii [One can think of several other
scenarios how international partnerships]{.underline} (also with the
private sector) [can help to ensure **more coordinated take
down**]{.underline} of adversarial operations - actions beneficial to
both the US and its partners. Risks for Allies and Intelligence
Collection This section addresses four connected risks associated with
US strategy. The first risk is perhaps the most obvious: [if U.S. Cyber
Command directly operates in allied networks without consent, it creates
friction by allies undermining trust]{.underline}. Operating instantly
makes sense considering the potential operational tempo of adversaries:
You cannot have protracted diplomatic discussions for two months with an
ally about whether or not to take down some command and control
infrastructure of an adversary hosted in the allied country. You don't
have days, let alone months. As a participant mentioned at the 2019
Cyber Command Symposium on strategy: "Opportunities within this domain
are fleeting." xxxviii Operating seamlessly could also make sense if an
ally does not mind the U.S. coming into its networks to address the
malicious activity. In this vein, [the U.S. can continue to build
partnerships with countries that do not have the capacity to defend
against cyber attacks on their own]{.underline}, as described above.
But, [what if an allied country is not keen on having the U.S. military
in its networks]{.underline}, actively, seamlessly, and [continuously
disrupting an adversary's cyber operations?]{.underline} As the German
case shows, this **[scenario will likely come up a lot more in the near
future]{.underline}**. Second, it is not just about cyber effect
operations taking place in systems or networks in allied territory.
There could also be [a negative impact on allied intelligence operations
and capabilities beyond these systems and networks]{.underline}. The U.S
Cyber Command - and other military cyber organizations - are operating
in a global environment historically dominated by intelligence agencies,
and the Five Eyes has always been the most dominant actor in
cyberspace.xxxix But the anglophone intelligence alliance is not the
only intelligence actor operating across the world. **[Recent
cases]{.underline}**---such as the infiltration of the Dutch General
Intelligence and Security Service into the Russia-based network of the
infamous hacking group Cozy Bear---[have illustrated the continued
global prevalence and value of allies' intelligence
operations]{.underline} beyond the Five Eyes alliance.xl [If U.S. Cyber
Command increasingly take up the role of 'disrupter' it may negatively
impact **global intelligence**]{.underline} collection of
allies---particularly those countries that favor long-term access over
immediate effect. It will also more likely uncover and burn allied
capabilities. **[The risks of occurring are higher than one may
think]{.underline}** as intelligence agencies have a tendency and
incentive to target and track the same entities. For example, in late
2014, cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab reported on the so-called
\"Magnet of Threats". The cybersecurity company discovered a server
belonging to a research organization in the Middle East that
simultaneously hosted implants for at least five Advanced Persistent
Threat (APT) actors: Regin and the Equation Group, Turla and ItaDuke,
Animal Farm, and Careto. xli All of these APTs have been associated with
prominent national security and intelligence agencies. Equation group
and Regin are connected to the Five-Eyes. As said, Animal Farm has been
attributed to France\'s external intelligence agency. Turla Group has
been associated with the Russian federal security service (FSB). ItaDuke
is said to be linked to the Russian government too. Finally, it is
theorized that Spain is behind Careto, also known as 'The Mask'.
Consider what would have happened if one of those five APT groups had
sought to cause a disruptive effect - rather than collect intelligence -
against the target in the Middle East. It likely would have resulted in
much earlier discovery and analysis by threat intelligence companies (or
other actors) exposing the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of
each actor group. Also, even the anticipation of more cyber effect
operations in non-allied networks from one allied state could lead to a
change in operations by another state. Indeed, states have shown in the
past that the anticipation of early discovery of an operation has led to
a change in their TTPs. For example, the National Security Agency (NSA)
created an \"exploit orchestrator\" called FoxAcid, an internet-enabled
system capable of attacking target computers in a variety of different
ways, depending on whether it is discovered---or likely to be
discovered---in a given network.xlii FoxAcid has a modular design, with
flexibility allowing the NSA to swap and replace exploits and run
different exploits based on various considerations. Against technically
sophisticated targets where the chance of detection is high, FoxAcid
would normally choose to run low-value exploits. Third, [**allied
friction could potentially be exploited by adversaries**. Adversaries do
not randomly choose which intermediate nodes to direct their operations
through. If Russia has the choice to go through a network that would
raise some serious diplomatic friction between the U.S. and a U.S. ally,
or operate through a network that would cause no diplomatic friction for
the U.S., what would it prefer? It would make sense for adversaries to
operate through the networks of exactly those countries with which the
U.S. has a strong relationship but that do not want the U.S. to operate
within their networks causing any effects.]{.underline} Russia is
already good at exploiting divisions between the U.S. and its allies.
Cyber Command's new strategy might give it another avenue to do so.
Fourth, whilst **[allies can integrate their cyber efforts into U.S.
strategy]{.underline}** of persistent engagement, [if **allies would
adopt their own strategy** of persistent engagement - mirroring U.S.
current doctrine and practice - **it would likely further undermine the
alliance relationships**. If US strategy of persistent engagement leads
allies to adopt their own strategy of persistent engagement, it would
mean **allies also seek "superiority in cyberspace";**]{.underline}
"continuously engaging and contesting adversaries and causing them
uncertainty wherever they maneuver"; and operating "seamlessly, globally
and continuously" - as stated in the Cyber Command vision. More
specifically, it would mean that allies [seek to **swiftly achieve
effects in systems and networks that are potentially located on U.S.
territory**]{.underline}, without necessarily notifying the U.S.
government before. In other words, it means that **[networks and systems
turn into red space and gray space for allies]{.underline}** - like
allied networks are now gray and red space for the U.S. to actively
disrupt and degrade adversarial operations. It is unlikely that the U.S.
government would react positively if Germany, or any other allied
country for that matter, hacks into a server hosting Russian propaganda
that was located in the United States, with some form of notification
but without Pentagon's consent.xliii There are numerous reasons why the
[US government would be **upset** with this type of
behavior]{.underline}. It would likely be seen as reckless from
Germany - especially if the US was already on those same networks for
intelligence collection purposes. An important dimension of this
scenario is derived from the fact that the U.S. is a vast target rich
environment, potentially even prioritized as a target by adversaries
such as China, Russia, North Korea, Iran - as well as non-state actors.
As stated above, red space and gray space are defined, according to U.S.
Joint Publication 3-12 on Cyberspace Operations, based on what "nodes"
adversaries "control". There are many nodes adversaries (of US allies)
want to control in the US. In other words, if US allies would seek to
swiftly disrupt and degrade cyber operations in red space and gray space
on a constant-basis, much of that would be in the United States. Last
year the NATO alliance reached a landmark that went largely unnoticed:
there are now more NATO member states that have publicly declared they
are seeking to establish an institutional capacity within the military
forces to conduct cyber effects operations than there are member states
that have remained publicly silent on this issue.xliv Yet, [most NATO
members are still at the early stages of organizational
development]{.underline} - and pour relatively few resources into their
military cyber organizations to conduct cyber effects operations.xlv
Their operational capacity is limited. France and Germany stand out for
the extent of resources officially allocated to their military cyber
organizations (beyond the Five-Eyes) - but public statements about these
figures are generally hard to interpret and compare given distinct
institutional design across military cyber organizations of states.xlvi
This [risk is]{.underline} therefore less significant for the short
term, but is **[likely to grow in the medium to long
term]{.underline}**. Conclusion and Discussion The purpose of this paper
was to provide a benefit-risk assessment of US strategy for its allies
and intelligence collection. Whilst the U.S. government's mission to
persistently engage with adversaries may have benefits for allied
states, the paper identified several avenues how the strategy leads to
negative implications for the alliance. To conclude, it is therefore
worth considering how these risks can be mitigatedFirst, the principles
of persistent engagement and defend forward are often jointly discussed.
How the two principles relate to each other, however, remains unclear.
According to some, persistent engagement is an 'operationalization' of
the defend forward concept. Others believe there is a difference between
the two concepts. If the latter is the case, it is important to assess
to what degree a strategy of persistent engagement necessitates
'defending forward' and contesting adversaries wherever they are. In
other words, the question is whether sufficient friction can be created
without causing disruption in allied networks. Second, terminology about
terrain in cyberspace is frequently confused by policymakers and
experts. [The U.S. government **needs to (re)assess**]{.underline} how
its terminology of terrain in the physical domains applies to
cyberspace. Last, NATO allies [should consider establishing memoranda of
understanding on offensive cyber effects operations]{.underline} in
systems or networks based in allied territory.xlvii The goal of the
proposed memorandum would be to [reduce discord among the allies;
enhance trust, transparency and confidence between allies]{.underline};
and improve the effectiveness of disrupting and deterring adversaries'
operations in cyberspace. The scope of the memorandum would include: i)
developing a common notification equity framework for out-of-networks
operations which seek to achieve cyber effects in allied systems or
networks; ii) identifying procedures for communicating the consideration
and conduct of offensive cyber effects operations between states against
systems or networks in allied territory; and iii) identifying technical
solutions and administrative documentation required for the continuous
exchange of information on offensive cyber operations. In writing the
memorandum, states first and foremost should agree on the equities
involved in permitting signatories to conduct cyber effect operations in
each other's networks---and the relative weight of those equities.
Equities that should be considered include: i) the ability of an actor
to take action to negate known threats on or to the other parties'
networks and systems; ii) the likelihood that an action will negate
known threats; iii) the imminence and scale of the threat; iv) the risk
of collateral damage; v) whether the computer system or network is
government-owned or privately owned; and vi) the certainty that the
system or network will be used to achieve strategic effects by the
adversary.xlviii Finally, though the memorandum of understanding may
help in promoting stability and enhancing confidence amongst allies, it
is not a silver bullet. It can only reduce allied concerns rather than
mitigate them. Military cyber organizations may still conduct
effect-based operations in allied territory without consent, leading
allies to assert that their sovereignty has been violated.

America's [deprioritization of allies creates **opportunities** for
revisionist powers]{.underline}. Such transition is recurrent in
geopolitics; **[i]{.underline}**nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations
[are always characterized by **uncertainty**]{.underline}. Policy makers
have to navigate a landscape that is often difficult to delineate, full
of strategic actors whose purposes are often obscure and whose power is
difficult to assess. [**Intentions** are notoriously hard to
divine]{.underline}, in part because rival states obfuscate them but in
part because often the states themselves do not have a clear and
consistent perception of what they want to achieve. [**Uncertainty**
arises]{.underline} also out of a more quantifiable source of knowledge,
an assessment of hard power, which is imperfect and results in widely
different estimates. It is sufficient to recall the challenges of
assessing Soviet power throughout the Cold War. Moments characterized by
alleged **[large shifts]{.underline}** in relative power [present
particularly **acute problems** of assessing **power** and
**intent**ions, adding an additional **layer** of **ambiguity** and
**uncertainty**. **Rumors** of change put in doubt the
relatively]{.underline} well- known, or at least [familiar, geopolitical
situation]{.underline}. All parties involved are unsure about their
position relative to the others, the extent of their political sway, and
the match between their commitments and their power. The [established
great powers may have a **crisis of confidence**]{.underline}, while
emboldened rising states are uncertain how far their influence extends
as well as how solid and credible is the power reach of their weakening
rival. Revisionist powers now openly but cautiously question what was
the grudgingly accepted geopolitical status quo. Rising powers are thus
curious but careful. They are interested in pushing the existing
boundaries of their influence but do not know how far they can do so
without meeting a firm opposition of the other power. In the current
case, U.S. rivals--- [China, Russia, and Iran--- appear keen to assert
their influence]{.underline} and establish what they deem their rightful
position in their respective regions and in the world but are also eager
to avoid a direct confrontation with the United States.
[Uncertain]{.underline} about their own power relative to the United
States, [they **test the hypothesis** of]{.underline} a [growing
American]{.underline} economic and [military fragility and decaying
political reach]{.underline}. To figure out the new map of power, and
possibly to redraw it at low cost, [revisionist powers engage in
**probing**]{.underline}. In this chapter we examine this behavior---
the probing by revisionist powers. We define probing as a low- intensity
and low- risk test aimed at gauging the opposing state's power and will
to maintain security and influence over a region. It is a set of actions
that studiously avoids a direct military confrontation with the leading
power by targeting the outer limits of its commitments and interests.
There, along the outer rim of its influence, the hegemon is at the
furthest of its commitments and power projection. The perception, or
rather the suspicion, of its decline is most consequential along these
frontiers of power because the revisionist state senses opportunities in
its own neighborhood and searches for confirmation of the rival's
weakness. Probing is an opportunistic behavior. It occurs when the
revisionist states detect a permissive international situation, namely,
when they think that the existing great power is retreating. It is still
a behavior that is characterized by self- doubt and uncertainty,
although if unanswered it results in the confirmation of the belief in
the rival's decline and may lead to ever more assertive challenges to
the international order and expansions of influence by the geopolitical
challenger. Over the past few years, and with greater frequency and
brazenness, regional powers opposed to the United States have been
engaging in probing. Russia, Iran, and China in their respective regions
have been working under the hypothesis that the United States is
retreating, out of choice, fatigue, or weakness, or all three combined.
The American retrenchment is more pronounced in the Middle East, with
the ending of U.S. combat presence in Iraq and the drawdown in
Afghanistan as well as the unwillingness to intervene in Syria, leaving
a vacuum for Iranian influence. But there is an equally pervasive
perception of American withdrawal or decline in the other two key
regions, Europe and Asia. In Europe, the perception is that Washington
is redirecting its strategic focus and resources toward Asia and has
limited willpower to back its extended deterrent, giving Moscow a window
of opportunity to redraw the map in Europe's eastern "borderlands. " And
in Asia, a rising and confident China looks at a United States hobbled
by financial crises, fiscal imbalances, and a decade- long military
overstretch in the Middle East. The reasons are different, but the broad
perception is similar: the revisionist states sense an opening left by a
distracted and weakening United States. And they probe along the
periphery of American influence, from Ukraine to the South China Sea
through the Persian Gulf. ORIGINS OF PROBING BEHAVIOR Probing stems out
of a tentative belief that the existing geopolitical order is amenable
to change, and it seeks to confirm this suspicion. A perceived
geopolitical change remains only that, perceived, until facts on the
ground confirm it. An assessment of a state's power is merely an
estimate of how that state may fare in a clash with others. As such, it
informs a set of expectations for the future, and it may or may not
reflect reality. Often there is little agreement among powers as well as
within those powers as to which assessment of power is correct.1 Today,
for instance, questions about the continued resilience of American power
abound both abroad and in the United States, and there are analysts on
both sides of the argument.2 Regardless of where one stands on the issue
of American relative decline or retrenchment, the mere existence of such
a debate is a source of concern because it points to an absence of
clarity on the geopolitical scene. The various strategic actors no
longer know where they stand on the international pecking order and are
confused as to how far their own influence can reach and what the
responses of their rivals may be.3 These are periods of a tense peace
but also of great uncertainty about the nature of the security
environment. As a scholar put it, it is the "fog of peace" that makes
strategic planning more difficult because it is unclear who the enemy
is, how much power a potential rival may have, and where the boundaries
of political influence are.4 As history indicates, often such an
uncertain strategic environment degenerates into war, which is a
"dispute about the measurement of power. "5 The outcome of a war is the
violent clarification of such confusion. It settles the dispute about
the assessment of power. A victory or defeat in war, followed by changes
in boundaries, military bases, or political affiliations of governments,
is one way to prove or disprove a perceived alteration in relative
power. As British historian A.J.P. Taylor observed, the "test of a Great
Power is . . . the test of strength for war. "6 After its defeat in the
1853-- 1856 Crimean War, Russia was clearly militarily inferior to
European states (even though the victorious powers, Britain, France,
Turkey, and later Austria, also encountered serious difficulties in
projecting power to the Black Sea theater) and consciously chose to
retreat, reform, and rebuild its foundations of power, known as a policy
of recueillement, in order to maintain its status as a European great
power.7 There is no clearer confirmation of a state's decline than a
loss in a direct confrontation with a rising power; there is equally no
better proof that the perception of relative decline was incorrect when
the aspirant revisionist state is soundly defeated. In the immediate
aftermath of a war it is therefore easier to assess one's own power
relative to that of the other players. War lifts the "fog of peace. "
But war is rarely pursued simply to clarify one's own uncertain standing
relative to the other strategic actors. To engage in war, the ultimate
test of power, is exceedingly dangerous, and no leader wants to enter
into a violent conflict simply as a way of assessing the power of its
own state relative to the target. Wars are realms of luck and un knowns
as much as of more calculable kinetic clashes, and consequently the
outcomes do not always align with the expectations preceding them.8 In
fact, the losing party in a conflict has often entered that war having
overestimated its own capability relative to the rival. Many in Europe,
for instance, expected in summer 1914 to be "home for Christmas, " only
to remain in the bloody trenches for several years. Given this inherent
uncertainty, the risk of being proven wrong for both the perceived
rising and declining powers is high, and great powers in history seem to
stumble into wars rather than consciously pursue them as tests of
strength. The risks of war are incalculable and thus extremely high. A
less risky way of assessing a changing equilibrium of power is through
probing. This is a form of strategic behavior meant to test existing
perceptions of power relations, seeking at the same time to draw the
presumably new boundaries of influence. The rising or revisionist state,
in particular, is strongly motivated to test the will of its seemingly
declining rival power. It has the aspiration, mitigated by the fear of
the rival great power, to alter the existing geopolitical map. Such
states, unhappy with the existing international order, which they
perceive perhaps as imposed on them and certainly as increasingly not
reflective of their own rising aspirations and power, have the most to
gain from probing. If this behavior confirms the perception that the
existing great power is on the wane and that the map drawn by it is no
longer supported by its strength and will, the revisionist state may be
able to reassert lost influence over its neighborhood and revise a
previous settlement. At the same time, such a state has also a strong
incentive to avoid a direct clash with its main antagonist lest the
perception of its relative weakening turns out not to match reality. A
strategy of direct confrontation is risky because its success is
predicated on the relative weakness of the targeted power, the existing
hegemon, and this is exactly what is unknown. If the probing power
becomes convinced that its hypothesis of its own superiority (and of the
relative decline of the rival) is true, then a direct clash may occur.
But until that confirmation, a safer, less risky course of action is to
engage in a probing behavior, akin to testing the water before jumping
in. Probes target the frontier of the rival power's influence, where its
interests are less pronounced, its power is at its farthest projection,
and its political clout at its weakest. At these outer edges the
response of the great power is expected to be most restrained, while the
gains of the probing state are most likely to occur. The purpose of
probing, therefore, is to gauge the resolve of the targeted powers. We
will return to this later, but here it is important to note that a
probing action is also a way of showing the renewed or freshly acquired
capabilities and aspirations that otherwise would remain latent and
without tangible effects. One cannot revise an established order by
keeping one's own intentions and capabilities hidden. Showing a new
military platform, often in a carefully choreographed event, is one way
of signaling growing power. The 1907-- 1909 voyage of the American
"Great White Fleet, " meant to showcase the emergent global naval
strength of the United States, was one such episode. The round- the-
globe cruise was not targeted at a specific power and did not aim to
extend American influence over a particular state or region. Rather, it
was a broad assertion of American capabilities and global reach, and the
other powers, Great Britain in particular, certainly received it as a
sign that the United States was a power to be reckoned with. But probing
is more than showing off. It is not simply an action of strutting on the
world stage with newly acquired military gadgets and political
confidence but a precisely targeted action with clear objectives.
Through probing, a revisionist state aims at changing the existing
geopolitical order where it thinks it can, namely, at the farthest
points of the ruling great power's influence. Probing, therefore, is not
just mere signaling of displeasure with the rules of the international
order and the map of power; it aims to revise the order gradually and
carefully, starting from the outer layers of the rival great power's
influence. FEATURES OF PROBING The purpose of probing is threefold.
First, a probing state aims to check whether the rumors of its rival's
weakening are true. A probe is a test, meant to elicit a response from
the targeted power. Second, the revisionist state that engages in
probing behavior wants to avoid a direct military clash with the
existing great power. The risks of being wrong about the rival's resolve
and capability are simply too big. Third, the state's objective is to
achieve, if possible, low- cost revision of the existing regional order.
These purposes can be seen in the features that characterize a probe and
distinguish it from other types of behavior, ranging from fullout
aggression to commercial pressures and diplomatic démarches. First,
probes are low intensity, vigilantly avoiding a direct war with the main
rival power. They are below the horizon of direct military
confrontation. The revisionist state has no interest in starting an
allout military conflict with the rival great power, perhaps declining
but still more than a match. The level of violence used, therefore, is
low, and probes are limited projections of power in areas of less
pronounced interest to the rival. A probing power engages in a lot of
selfrestraint; it intentionally elects to keep the use of force at a
minimum. It can but chooses not to escalate. A probe is a calculated
gamble, not a foolish thrashing around. The desire to avoid a war with
the existing hegemon often leads the revisionist to project power under
cover of civilian or paramilitary forces, part of a larger trend of
"civilianization" of conflict.9 By using unmarked units to harass a U.S.
protégé, a state is able to de ny authorship of provocative actions and
thereby avoid a more violent and direct war while at the same time
chipping away at the rival's influence and wealth. The possibility of
denying that an aggression has occurred drives costs of revisionism
lower. For instance, the sixteenth- century privateer Sir Francis Drake
acted on behalf of Queen Elizabeth I, raiding Spanish shipping but never
in an official capacity. The queen went so far as to tell a Spanish
ambassador that "Drake was a private adventurer, and that she had
nothing to object to his alleged execution. " She was careful in not
provoking Spain too much but eager to "singe the King of Spain's beard.
"10 A similar approach can be seen around the world today. The initial
Russian push into Crimea in 2014 was done anonymously with unmarked
special forces, dubbed by Ukrainians as the "little green men, " a clear
example of a long- standing Russian practice of tactical deception and
disguise (maksirovka).11 It was an indication that Moscow was unsure
whether Ukrainian forces would react, and, in the event of a determined
opposition, it maintained the option of either escalating with larger
conventional forces or halting operations and denying. Moscow seemed to
be more careful in masking the identity of its forces in eastern
Ukraine, where the local opposition was more assertive and the Western
displeasure with Russian aggression more pronounced. The greater the
risk of a strong response from the actors targeted, the more carefully
tailored, dissimulated, and low- intensity is the probe. The use of
unmarked troops and paramilitary forces allows Russia to claim that no
aggression has occurred, and thus no military response from Ukraine or
from the West is warranted. China has been testing the limits of the
influence of the United States and its allies in the South China Sea
using an array of civilianlooking vessels. Its fishing fleet, combined
with a fishery- enforcement fleet, is integrated into its military
institutions and plays an active role in expanding China's maritime
reach. As Lyle Goldstein observes, this is part of a "strategy of
'defeating harshness with kindness' (yi rou ke gang)" whereby China
deploys "unarmed fishing vessels or fisheries enforcement vessels to
confront foreign vessels operating in its EEZ and claimed waters. "12
This low- intensity push tests the fron tier of American influence in a
way that makes a U.S. response difficult.13 A foray by a Chinese naval
vessel into contested waters can be countered with the might of the
United States and its ally's navy; a probe by fishing vessels manned by
Chinese fishermen does not warrant the involvement of the U.S. Seventh
Fleet. This is risky behavior, but it also indicates a desire by China
to avoid a war with the other regional powers as well as with the United
States.14 If it is openly a military attack, a probe is conducted with a
strong and perhaps warranted belief that the rival power will not
intervene because it is distracted elsewhere and because it deems the
targeted region to be of little immediate interest. This was the case of
the Russian war with Georgia in 2008, when Moscow felt emboldened by
NATO ambivalence to extending its membership process to Tbilisi and by
the American strategic distraction by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
(where a small Georgian contingent was deployed). The Russian gamble was
based on the expectation of no meaningful Western, and American in
particular, response. The objective was to chip away at the unwelcome
Western influence in Russia's neighborhood but without spurring an
equally unwelcome Western military reply--- to "singe America's beard, "
as it were. Second, a revisionist state engages in probing because it
sees it as a low- risk but high- reward behavior. The low risk stems in
part from the first feature, the carefully tailored level of
aggressiveness that is expected not to elicit a full- out military
response by the rival. It is also related to the third feature,
explained below, namely, the fact that the immediate target of probing
is geographically and political peripheral to the interests of the rival
great power, and consequently contributes to the low likelihood of a
forceful military response. But on top of being pursued as a low- risk
action, a probe can yield high strategic rewards. Most often the
revisionist power seems to direct probing behavior to its immediate
vicinity, hoping to expand its influence over neighboring and thus more
controllable regions.15 It is there that it has the greatest chances of
extending its own political shadow successfully. Probes are rarely long-
distance projections of power because incursions deep into the rival's
sphere of influence are more liable to be met with more assertive
responses as well as being less likely to establish durable control by
the probing state. The farther the revisionist state engages in probing
behavior, the more high risk and low reward it is, and vice versa. Hence
the more likely locations for probing behavior are in the near
neighborhood of the revisionist power. Furthermore, probes focus on
strategically important regions, either resource rich or located along
lines of communication, or both. Elizabethan England, for example,
conducted raiding probes of Spain's vulnerable transatlantic arteries
bringing gold from the New World--- not its stronger positions in the
Mediterranean. Imperial Germany's probes of the Anglo- French alliance
targeted Morocco, located near the strategically important choke point
of Gibraltar but beyond easy reach of the main British fleet. Today
China's probes of U.S. allies in Asia often target oil and gas fields in
the South China Sea. In all these cases, since the goal of probing is to
test the power and commitment of a rival state, it has to be directed at
regions where the rival's influence is present but not preponderant. It
is unlikely that regions of no geostrategic value or with few resources
have much of a presence of the rival great power, and as such they are
not prime material for probing. A state may still have imperial
aspirations in such regions, but not every extension of power is a
probe. Probing is not simply grabbing new areas of influence but first
and foremost to test the will of the rival. There may be, of course, the
bonus that if the probe is successful, it may result in the addition of
strategically important regions. The third feature of probing is that it
is peripheral or indirect. The target of the probe is the periphery or
the frontier of the tested power where the rival's presence is at its
farthest reach, its interests are less pronounced, and thus its response
is expected to be muted. Fearful of a militarily assertive response, the
state that is probing is careful not to target areas that are clearly
considered of primary and existential interests, such as the rival's
homeland or its immediate neighbors. Hence the visits of Russian or
Iranian naval vessels to Venezuelan ports are less a probe per se than
an act of grandstanding, since all sides know that the United States
could quickly bring overwhelming force to bear in the event of a crisis.
These are temporary publicity stunts rather than a calculated attempt to
test the hegemon's commitment to maintaining the status quo. Probes test
for perceived weaknesses, not strengths, and it is on the outer
boundaries of the existing great power that its influence is likely to
appear the most fragile. The revisionist power is interested in probing
the power and influence of its rival in places where that influence is
at its weakest, overstretched, and uncertain. During the Peloponnesian
War the Spartan general Brasidas adopted such a peripheral strategy, but
only a decade into the conflict. The initial Spartan approach of annual
invasion of Attica, Athens's immediate neighborhood, failed to inflict
sufficient damage to end the war. It was only with Brasidas, sent north
with a small force of helots (minimizing thus the risk to Spartan
manpower), that Sparta changed its strategy to one similar to probing,
by persuading or forcing distant Athenian allies in Thrace to switch
sides. And many did reconsider their allegiance to Athens, because, as
Thucydides observes, there did not seem to be much risk given the
distance from Athens and their belief that this empire was on the
wane.16 Striking the rival's periphery, and its allies, not only was
cheaper than assaulting it directly but also forced it to devote a lot
of resources to reasserting the lost influence. Global powers in
particular have a "periphery or frontier problem" that invites probing.
A lengthy frontier, distant from the homeland and thus from key
logistical bases, is difficult to protect. The sheer amount of power
needed to outfit the distant outposts, combined with the uncertainty as
to the location and timing of potential attacks, makes it impossible to
have an impermeable frontier. When a power assesses threats, the key
questions of "where, when, and by whom" are directly related to the
length of the imperial frontier. A regional power has well- delimited
borders and a clear idea of who the rival is. For instance, from the
final decade of the nineteenth century on, Germany was burdened with the
possibility of a two- front war, with France on one side and Russia on
the other; a serious problem of military planning caused by poor
diplomacy but not a source of strategic confusion. For a global power,
it is that strategic clarity that is missing, resulting in the need to
prepare for multiple contingencies and ultimately to stretch resources
in several theaters of potential action.17 While imperial Germany could
concentrate on its two- front problem, Great Britain at the turn of the
twentieth century had to consider threats from Russia (in Central Asia,
pushing toward India), Japan (in the Asian littoral sphere), France (in
Africa as well as the Mediterranean), and Germany (in Europe and the
North Sea in particular). Through deft diplomacy, it managed to
neutralize the first three, allowing it to focus on the German naval
threat, thereby limiting its "frontier problem. " In practice, probing
the periphery of a rival's great power often translates into testing the
strength of its alliances. Most great powers, or empires, expand their
influence in informal ways, through political arrangements with local
elites and formal alliances.18 The security of these great powers, in
particular of ones with global reach, therefore resides not only in the
safety of their borders but in their ability to hold rivals at a
distance and thwart their challenges to faraway interests. They do so
only in part through their own forces and rely heavily on the presence
of allies that provide additional military strength and local deterrence
(see chapter 5). Allies are at the periphery of influence and strength
of great powers, and it is there that the powers' commitment and
influence are at their weakest. It is clear that a state will respond to
an encroachment on its territorial possessions or to an attack against
its forward deployed forces. It is less certain, however, that a state
will respond in the same strong fashion to similar actions directed
against its allies and their interests. The security guarantee extended
to them, the foundation of the alliance, is a promissory note that
carries a high degree of uncertainty. Placing bases with troops on the
territory of an ally is a time- tested way of diminishing this
uncertainty. As Thomas Schelling put it, the role of U.S. troops in
South Korea was simply to die, buttressing the American security
guarantee to its ally.19 The loss of American soldiers to an initial
attack by the enemy would, so the argument goes, create powerful
pressures for Washington to respond. French general Ferdinand Foch, when
asked before World War I how many British troops would be needed for the
security of France, replied, "One single private soldier . . . and we
would take good care that he was killed. "20 Probes by the revisionist
power are not attacks against these bases and forces that underwrite the
credibility of the extended deterrent. Rather, they target areas that
may be of great importance to the ally but not necessarily to the
security patron. That is the periphery of the periphery, so to speak,
the tip of the great power's commitment. The United States has a
particularly pronounced "periphery" problem. There are few direct
threats to the continental United States, short of a large- scale
assault with weapons of mass destruction or the tragic yet relatively
small and isolated terrorist attack. While the absence of a contiguous
threat is a geopolitical blessing, it also means that most of the
menaces to U.S. interests and security are outside of the North American
continent. Hence, in the competitive international environment, "the
strategic position of the United States rests ultimately on its ability
to project power over great distances. "21 In practice this entails
managing alliances that maintain stability and keep U.S. rivals on the
defensive in key regions of the world, in particular along an arc from
Europe to East Asia through the Middle East. And historically this has
been, and continues to be, achieved by extending U.S. deterrence beyond
the North American continent to the countries, some allied by treaty and
some neutral. Such an extended deterrence is a " 'three- nation problem'
involving an aggressor nation, the United States, and some smaller
nation which is the object of the aggressor's designs and which
Washington seeks to protect. "22 Probing by an "aggressor nation" aims
to test U.S. commitment to these "smaller nations, " which constitute
the periphery of American interests and power. In the most successful
case, probing could achieve a dual purpose: first, it tests the level
and credibility of the commitment of the distant security patron, and
second, it can weaken the rival alliance. It does so by targeting the
foundation of the alliance, the belief that the alliance is beneficial
to both parties and that it is effective. As Michael Mandelbaum has
observed, alliances need to manage two concurrent fears: one of
entrapment, namely, of being dragged into undesirable wars of limited
significance and local interest, and one of abandonment, the
apprehension of often the weaker ally of be ing abandoned by its
security provider when the need comes. 23 Probing aims to increase the
rival's fear of entrapment while at the same time stoking worries of
abandonment among its weaker and more dependent partners. By harassing
the local interests of the rival's peripheral allies, the revisionist
power wants to drive up the risk of a local war, perceived by the rival
as a distraction and a potential drain of resources. At the same time,
it wants to indicate to the smaller allies that they may not rely on
their security provider to defend their local, narrow interest, and that
they may be abandoned. The goal is to drive a wedge in the opposing
alliance by leveraging the fundamental dilemma of alliances--- the fears
of entrapment and abandonment. This is where probing becomes more than a
simple test of the rival's strength. By targeting the outer edges of the
existing hegemon, and thus harassing its alliance system, the
revisionist is engaging in a much more significant endeavor. The contest
for regional, or global, control is in the end a contest for allies.
A.J.P. Taylor observed that when Germany "was bidding for the domination
of Europe" in the decade before the outbreak of World War I, "her chosen
method was to isolate the independent Powers one from another. "24 As we
point out in chapter 5, allies are, among other things, an extension of
the distant patron's power. Were they to peel away from the side of
their security guarantor--- or vice versa, were the security guarantor
to decide that the risk of continued support of a distant ally pressured
by a regional revisionist power is too big--- it would in either case
signify a retrenchment of power for that offshore patron. The loss of
allies is both a confirmation of the waning sway of that rival great
power as well as a further reduction in its reach. To be alone in inter
national relations is to be vulnerable, inviting further aggressive
behavior from the rival. Walter Lippmann observed in 1943, "No one knew,
not Hitler, not Stalin, not Chamberlain or Daladier, the relative
strength of the Axis and of the opposing combination. Only when Hitler
succeeded at Munich in separating the Franco- British allies from
Russia, had he so altered the balance of power in his favor that a war
for the conquest of Europe was from his point of view a good risk. "25
War is an extension of successful probing. The benefits of targeting
allies of a rival, rather than the rival itself, are well recognized in
history. The astute observer of history and politics Niccolò Machiavelli
noted in his Discourses that attacking a rival's ally is always a
preferred option: "For I know especially that if I assault his friend,
either he will resent it and I will have my intention of making war with
him, or by not resenting it he will uncover his weakness or
faithlessness in not defending a client of his. Both the one and the
other of these two things are able to take away his reputation and to
make my plans easier . "26 In the strategic behavior we describe, the
probing power is not interested in "making war" with the rival, and
therefore a probe is not a full- out attack on a rival's ally or
supported state. The risks of activating the security guarantees or
assurances that ought to be at the foundation of that alliance are too
big. But it is an offensive act of sorts, which threatens the interests
of the rival's ally. The security patron will either respond, thereby
disproving the perception of its weakness, or will not, "taking away his
reputation" and undermining its alliance. China has been particularly
astute in picking geographic objectives that are important to U.S.
allies but only indirectly important to the United States, such as the
shoals and reefs around the Spratly and Paracel Islands. By ratcheting
up the pressure in these areas, China causes the targeted states to
intensify their demands for American assurance while diminishing U.S.
willingness to back allies over seemingly petty issues that could lead
to a larger conflict. Americans do not want to risk their lives for
insignificant and distant rocks. Russia achieves a similar effect by
reigniting NATO's eastern frontier through its attack on Ukraine and a
series of threats against exposed NATO members around the Baltic Sea.
Those are areas that until recently have not been prominent on the U.S.
strategic radar screen but are naturally vital to those smaller states
inhabiting the region, which in turn are driven to make increasingly
vocal requests for security reassurances from Washington. As in the case
of the South China Sea, however, the local and limited nature of the
rival's probes generates in Washington as much a perception of threat as
fear of a larger conflict, raising doubts about the benefits of
extending security guarantees to these allies and partners. In the end,
these peripheral probes pursued by U.S. rivals can create a wedge
between Washington and its regional friends and allies. These three
features--- low intensity, low risk but high reward, peripheral--- point
also to the timing of the probing behavior. Probing is a strategic
behavior that arises out of an uncertain assessment of power relations.
It is the product of doubt, not confidence, in the resilience of the
existing international order. As such it arises early on in the
transition of power, when perceptions of rise and decline are not firm.
The vagueness of the security environment creates among revisionist
powers the perception of opportunities that a probing behavior aims to
test. Hence probing should occur with less frequency in the immediate
aftermath of a war, when, as we point out, an assessment of relative
power carries the weight of the ultimate test, war. A defeated power may
have all the incentives to upset the existing order, but unless it has
no ability to evaluate its clearly weakened position, it has no capacity
to do so. After a defeat probing may be tempting but is unfeasible. Such
states are more likely to pursue a policy of recueillement
(introspection, a moment of pause and strengthening), characterized by
internal reforms, modernization, and very limited foreign engagements
mostly aimed at dividing the opposing alliance.27 When, however, the
perceived weakening of the founding power puts in doubt the existing
international settlement, the desire to revise it is matched by the
possibility of doing so. The perception of American weakening, or at
least retrenchment, therefore opens up a window of opportunity for those
powers that aspire to expand their own influence and resent the Western
order and its institutions. THE AUDIENCES OF PROBING Another useful way
of looking at the strategic behavior of probing is by considering the
audiences involved. As we argued, a revisionist power pursues probing
behavior to check whether new boundaries of influence are feasible given
the perceived weakening of the rival. The main purpose is therefore to
elicit a response from the targeted audiences. That response, or lack
thereof, supplies information necessary to draw the new outline of the
geopolitical map. Probing is first and foremost a violent and risky
didactic exercise. The most direct audience is the immediate target of
the probing behavior, usually an ally, or an aspirant to be an ally, of
the rival great power. Probing here seeks to gauge the willingness and
capacity of the targeted state to withstand pressure, and ultimately it
aims to push that state to sever itself from its security patron. As we
examine in chapter 4, vulnerable frontier allies of a great power
actively consider alternative strategic options, especially when they
perceive themselves to be under threat from a neighboring revisionist
pow er and to have a fraying security guarantee from a distant patron. A
probe is meant to ratchet up the threat perception while also attempting
to establish a sense of strategic isolation and separation from the
security provider. Hence as important as, if not more important than,
the first audience is the second one: the distant but more powerful ally
and security provider. Probing tests indirectly the regional staying
power of the rival hegemon. While carefully avoiding direct
confrontation, the revisionist power wants to assess the commitment of
the opposing great power to its ally in the near neighborhood. What the
revisionist is testing, therefore, is not the rival's resolve to oppose
other great powers, but the rival's reliability to its own allies.28
Resolve is the willingness to risk war to achieve one's own objectives:
the more diffuse and distant the threatened interests, the less the
resolve. Given that the target of probes is peripheral and not the
rival's homeland or troops and bases, the resolve is assumed to be
small. Direct war between the revisionist probing state and the rival
great power is unlike ly to erupt as a result. Moreover, the probing
state is not interested in finding out whether the rival has the will to
fight a direct war: the stakes would be simply too high and the outcome
too uncertain. A direct challenge would test the resolve of the rival.
Poking around the periphery, therefore, is a poor test of the rival's
willingness to fight a war. History seems to confirm this. For instance,
as scholars have pointed out, Soviet leaders did not think that U.S.
responses to peripheral threats (e.g., in the Third World) could serve
as indicators of future American behavior when its core interests (NATO
allies, Japan, or the U.S. homeland) were threatened.29 Whether the
United States responded militarily or not to a Soviet foray in Angola or
Ethiopia could not be easily translated into expectations of future
American behavior in Europe. But it does affect the perception of
whether the United States wants to fight in other peripheral areas. "If
Soviet leaders were to gain the impression that the United States is
firmly set upon a course of neo- isolationism and the absolute avoidance
of intervention in local wars, they might become dangerously adventurous
in the Middle East and elsewhere. "30 [Probing]{.underline}, however,
[tests the reliability of the rival great power--- that is, its
willingness to **protect**]{.underline} and stand by [its
**ally**]{.underline} or aspiring allies. The immediate target is not a
test of the rival's general credibility but only of its commitment to
the security ties to the state. Probing wants to elicit a response (or
lack thereof) from the rival great power regarding the seriousness of
its commitment to the directly targeted state. [To be **perceived** as a
**reliable** ally means to **instill the belief** that **promised**
security guarantees will **hold** **even in cases of heightened
tensions** and, in final analysis, of conflict. Consequently a
**perception of low reliability** results in the belief that the
**alliance is fragile** and that it may be in the small state's interest
to seek accommodation with the nearby revisionist power]{.underline}. As
delineated above, probes are care fully tailored to split the distant
security patron from its regional allies, showing it to be unreliable.
Even if it achieves nothing else, probing can introduce doubts about the
security guarantees, forcing the security patron to renew its promises.
[The **less reliable** the security patron is perceived by its allies,
the more insistent are their **demands** for **continued** security
guarantees]{.underline}. Probing thus imposes an immediate cost on the
rival great power by reactivating a frontier region that until then was
dormant and by pressing the rival to expend more resources and political
capital to reassert its security guarantees. Finally, the third audience
is composed of the geopolitical onlookers, [states]{.underline} that are
**[watch]{.underline}**ing the [behavior and derive]{.underline} their
own [conclusions about the resilience of the existing great power. The
strategic interaction]{.underline} spurred by a probe [does not
**directly** affect them, but they perceive it as a regionally
circumscribed development with potentially more **global
repercussions**. That is, a probe is limited to a specific region but
has **radiating effects** as others also **see it for what it really
is**: a **test** of the **resilience** and **reliability** of the great
power that may be **analogous** in **other regions**]{.underline}.
[Recent academic literature puts in doubt the idea that reputation for
commitment is interdependent]{.underline}. Thomas Schelling, among
others, articulated that idea in his classic work from 1966 where he
argued that [U.S. **rep**utation was **global**]{.underline}, and [a
loss in one region]{.underline} would [have negative impact in **other
areas**. **Rep**utation was **not compartmentalized**]{.underline} in
different regions, in large measure because the rival, the Soviet Union,
was one and the same across the world map. Hence "we tell the Soviets
that we have to react here because, if we did not, they would not
believe us when we say that we will react there. "31
[Academics]{.underline} have relentlessly [questioned this argument,
resulting in]{.underline} copious [writings asserting that reputation is
not interdependent and]{.underline}, according to some, [does not even
matter]{.underline}.32 Reputation is merely a cult and does not exist in
international relations.33 Policy makers, however, disagree and continue
to speak of reputation for resolve and reliability as something that not
only matters and requires constant work but also is interdependent. They
prefer to rely on time- tested authors, from Thucydides to Machiavelli,
who consider reputation as indispensable to political power.34 In brief,
there is a deep gap between academics and policy makers on the issue of
reputation. [By observing recent events in the three frontier regions---
**Central Europe**, the **Middle East**, and **East Asia**--- we think
that the truth is closer to Schelling's view. It is clear that the
effects of probing behavior **do not remain confined** to the immediate
actors involved]{.underline} (the probing power, the direct target---
usually a rival's ally--- and the rival great power). **[Other
actors]{.underline}** in the region [are **keenly aware** of
the]{.underline} revisionist state's probing and of the [responses of
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. For instance,
other states, from the Baltics to Poland and Ukraine, observed Russia's
war against Georgia in 2008 and its invasion of Crimea in 2014 with
great trepidation.35 These wars were symptoms of a more assertive
Russia; a source of worry in themselves. But they were also meant to
elicit an answer from the United States. [**Any sign** of **American
hesitation**]{.underline} to respond quickly and firmly to Russian small
wars in the two states [was **perceived** as **affect**ing
directly]{.underline} these [**other states**, **not** directly
involved]{.underline} in the probing event. [America's **reputation**
for **reliability**, in other words, was at stake]{.underline}, even
though Georgia and Ukraine were not NATO members but only aspiring to
closer security and political relations with the United States and the
EU. Similarly, Pacific nations from Japan to Australia follow with great
attention China's probing behavior in the South China Sea that puts
pressure on Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan. They too seek to
figure out whether the United States has the will to remain as a
security provider in this region and to the "global commons" in general.
How the United States responds to a probe in a particular region
therefore affects its regional image. The question is whether [there
is]{.underline} also [a **wider, global audience** to **regional
probes**]{.underline}. Do **[Middle Eastern leaders watch American
responses to Russia's probing in Eastern Europe]{.underline}**? Do
Kremlin elites draw lessons from U.S. actions along the "first chain of
islands" in East Asia? Or, do Chinese neo- Mahanian leaders think the
United States is on the wane if it accommodates Putin's imperial
fantasies? According to the latest academic literature, the answer
should be negative: how the United States is perceived to be doing in
one region does not translate into a similar perception elsewhere. The
practical implication of such a view is that the United States should
not have fought in Vietnam to prove that it would stand its ground in
Europe; similarly, it ought not to oppose Putin around the Black Sea
basin simply to demonstrate that it will oppose China in the South China
Sea. But we are not so confident that [there are]{.underline} no
[**connections** between regional demonstrations of will and
power]{.underline}. It is at least plausible, and perhaps safer, to
argue that [there are **wider, global effects**]{.underline} of probing.
First, [the world is]{.underline} indeed [**global**, and regions are
**not hermetically separated** from each other]{.underline}. As Nicholas
Spykman observed, "[Global war]{.underline}, as well as global peace,
[means that **all fronts**]{.underline} and all areas [are
**interrelated**]{.underline}. No matter how remote they are from each
other, [**success or failure in one** will have an **immediate and
determining effect** on the **others**]{.underline}. It is necessary,
therefore, to see the world as a whole and to weigh the measures taken
to achieve victory in the light of conditions in all theaters. "36
[Leaders **watch** and **learn** from **other regions**, more than
previously in history when conflicts were limited by technology and
geographic knowledge to a contiguous region]{.underline}. Because of
their domestic opacity, it is difficult to prove that America's rivals
learn from U.S. behavior in other regions, but the question whether they
do so needs to be asked. Chinese military officials, for example, have
commented publicly on lessons for China from the U.S. handling of the
war in Ukraine.37 As one analyst noted, "It might be impossible to
determine definitively whether the **[Ukraine]{.underline}** Crisis has
[impacted **China's** risk calculus in **hotspots** such as the **South
and East China Sea**]{.underline}, but the evidence . . . certainly
suggests that such eastern reverberations are quite plausible. "38 At a
minimum we have to recognize that some [**cross- regional**
analyses]{.underline} do **[occur]{.underline}**, and it is safer to
assume that the [U.S. reputation does **not stay limited** to a
region]{.underline}. Second, [the much **strong**er effect of probing
appears to be on U.S. **allies** and friends, the **key geopolitical
spectators**. They **watch** how the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [treats **other allies** and form an
**opinion** regarding American reliability]{.underline}. The former
director of Saudi intelligence summed up the view of many [officials
from]{.underline} U.S. allied [states in the **Persian
Gulf**]{.underline} when he said in **[react]{.underline}**ion
[to]{.underline} the Russian seizure of **[Crimea]{.underline}**, "While
the wolf is eating the sheep, there is no shepherd to come to the
rescue. "39 [Israel was interested in the war in Georgia;
**Japan**]{.underline}ese analysts [followed the]{.underline} Obama
[administration's decision to cancel]{.underline} the Ballistic Missile
Defense ([BMD]{.underline}) program [in Central Europe]{.underline}; and
Polish experts watch U.S. moves in East Asia.40 The probing by
revisionist states is first and foremost an attempt to test the strength
of their rival's commitment to its allies and friends. In sum, probing
behavior by revisionist states targets these specific audiences in order
to elicit responses from them. The goal is to figure out whether and how
to draw the new map of power. And it puts the burden on the targeted
audiences: their responses determine whether the probe is successful.
EVALUATION OF PROBING: SUCCESS OR FAILURE From the perspective of the
revisionist power that engages in probing, whether a probe has achieved
its objectives determines its success or failure. The minimum objective
of the probing state is to measure the rival's staying power in its
neighboring region, an objective that is achieved whether the targeted
powers respond or not, but it is difficult to interpret. The targeted
rival may be tempted to ignore the probe not out of a sense of its own
weakness but in the belief that ignoring the test will send a signal of
strategic insouciance from its pedestal of power. Also, because of the
local and limited nature of a probe, directly involving only the
regional actors, it is tempting for the distant security provider to
leave the response to its allies and friends. A direct and strong
intervention by the offshore patron would escalate the interaction,
raising the chances of a larger war, an outcome that neither party
desires. But the shrewdness of a probing strategy is that it puts the
targeted rival power in the position of having either to escalate the
tensions in order to respond or to choose a less confrontational
approach but one that risks weakening its alliances. The response to the
probe, not the probe itself, is perceived as a potential cause of war.
This creates strong disincentives for the tested great power to react by
opposing the revisionist state's probe in a direct and forceful way, or
to respond at all. For instance, in the case of China's probing actions
in the South China Sea, the Obama administration's approach seems to
have been to accommodate Beijing, acknowledging a decline in U.S. naval
capabilities and welcoming a greater Chinese role in providing security
to the global commons.41 Similarly, after Russia's takeover of Crimea,
Washington's first response was to turn the episode into a strictly
regional affair. As President Obama put it in February 2014, "Any
violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be
deeply destabilizing, which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia,
or Europe, " tellingly not including the United States in the list of
the affected parties.42 The problem is that the temptation of the
existing great power to either ignore or regionalize the tension
stemming from the revisionist state's probes--- an attempt to de-
escalate the strategic interaction--- also constitutes a response. It
may, however, be one that serves for the revisionist power as a
confirmation of its initial suspicion that the rival's commitment to the
region was on the wane. [An **unanswered**]{.underline}--- ignored or
regionalized--- [probe is an indication that the]{.underline} existing
[map of power is **open to revisions**]{.underline}. Another way to put
this is that a probe is a question of sorts: does the existing hegemon
have the will and capacity to oppose the revisionist power? An attempt
to dismiss the question or to let allies respond to it is a tacit
admission by the tested great power that its interest in maintaining a
strong foothold and influence in the region is in decline. Silence in
response to a probe is telling. Probing, therefore, always elicits some
sort of answer, and in this narrow sense it is a success. The purpose of
a probe is also to attain a secondary, albeit crucial, goal of beginning
to redraw the map of influence without generating counterbalancing
pressures from the tested great power and its allies. The most
successful probe would be one that pushes the targeted small states and
other regional spectators closer to the revisionist power (or at least
convinces them to distance themselves from their existing security
patron, the rival great power) while at the same time convincing the
rival great power that it is too costly to maintain its political
influence and provide security in the region. Hence the probe needs to
be evaluated on what it achieves in the three audiences: the directly
targeted neighboring small state, the distant security patron, and the
geopolitical onlookers (in particular other states in the region). The
success or failure of a revisionist state's probe depends on the actions
by these three groups, and, arguably, it can attain partial success by
achieving a revision of the status quo in one audience but not the
other. For instance, a probe can succeed in extending the revisionist
power's influence over the immediate target, the ally or would- be ally
of the rival, but at the same time it may generate more vigorous efforts
by regional onlookers to counterbalance it through a variety of
strategies, ranging from military modernization to tighter defense
cooperation with the distant security patron. This seems to be the case
for Russia's takeover of Crimea. Moscow quickly conquered Crimea and
destabilized Ukraine's easternmost oblast, successfully demonstrating
its ability and willingness to use force to achieve limited territorial
adjustments. While Kiev maintains its political independence, it has
also been shown to be weak and unable to oppose Russian pressures. The
quasi-- civil war in the eastern regions and Russia's conquest of Crimea
make Ukraine an unlikely candidate for a closer relationship with the EU
and NATO, even if Ukrainian political elites and public opinion may
continue to be in favor of it. Russia's probe, in the form of its
intervention in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, has thus been successful in
neutering the westward drift of Kiev. The EU, and in particular states
such as France and Germany, have now an even smaller desire to bring
Ukraine closer, as it is deemed too dangerous and risky; Ukraine is not
worth losing business deals with Russia, not to mention starting a war
with Russia. The Ukraine War has also damaged American credibility in
the region. Washington after all had given assurances (not "guarantees,
" which are reserved for NATO members) to the Ukrainian government in
the Budapest Memorandum of 1994. This is undoubtedly a Russian success.
But there are also other consequences of Russia's probing, unintended
and unwelcome by Moscow. Some states in the Central European region, in
particular Poland and the Baltic states, have awakened from the
geopolitical vacation of the past two decades. The 1990s and the 2000s
were characterized by a widespread sense that threats to the territorial
security of the region were minimal, and most of the strategic focus was
on economic cooperation with the EU and on keeping in the good graces of
the United States through participation in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
This is over, at least in part. While strengthening the EU continues to
be a priority in Central European capitals, there is simply no more
interest in "out- of- area" operations, which drain resources and time
from territorial defense. From this perspective, Russian probes have
altered the geostrategic outlook of some Central European states. The
eastern frontier is what really matters to them now, as their threat
assessment has changed. Russia, in other words, has reached an upper
threshold in its probes, creating a backlash among some of the states in
the region, which are pursuing diplomatic counterbalancing and defense
modernization. They are also calling for more visible and permanent NATO
(and in particular, U.S.) security presence on their territories to
shore up the extended deterrent against Russia. It appears therefore
that Russia is less successful than the other revisionist power, China.
[Moscow is less subtle in its probes]{.underline}, choosing dramatic
military interventions (Georgia and Crimea) that generate growing fear
and opposition among some European states as well as the United States.
In part Moscow's more aggressive behavior is a result of a Russian
assessment of the weakness and divisions of the West. But in part the
seeming Russian rush to restore influence over its "near neighborhood"
is due to internal demographic, economic, and political problems. The
growing weakness of Russia, [a great power]{.underline} more by courtesy
and [by **nuclear weapons**]{.underline} than by economic and political
strength, gives little time to Putin to shore up his country's position
facing China's rapid economic growth and Europe's political appeal. It
is a short- term approach of large probes, and it may be successful only
by extending influence over its most immediate nearby target.43
[China]{.underline}, on the other hand, may have a different time frame,
allowing it to probe in a much more indirect and less violent way,
though this could change in the months ahead. It [is]{.underline}
therefore more careful and [guarded, pursuing]{.underline} a long- term
strategy of small [probes over]{.underline}, quite literally, small
rocks in [the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea. The U.S. "pivot" or "rebalancing" to Asia makes
American presence and resolve more pronounced, increasing the doubt of a
U.S. retrenchment and thus, from China's perspective, the need to be
cautious in testing the limits of American influence and commitment.
Moreover, the counterbalancing efforts of regional onlookers, from Japan
to the Philippines and Vietnam, are increasing in intensity, in both the
rhetoric used and the arms buildup. Similarly, unlike Russia in Crimea,
Beijing has not succeeded in extending its direct control over a large
piece of real estate. But in the end it may be more successful, because
it is establishing a gradual change in the map of power, visible only
after a decade- long period. Through its probes, China is pursuing a
classic example of "salami tactics. " As Thomas Schelling describes
them, "If there is no sharp qualitative division between a minor
transgression and a major affront, but a continuous gradation of
activity, one can begin his intrusion on a scale too small to provoke a
reaction, and increase it by imperceptible degrees, never quite
presenting a sud den, dramatic challenge that would invoke the committed
response. "44 Many small probes into areas of contested influence do not
individually invite a strong response, but they erode steadily the
perception and in the end the reality of the opponent's influence.
Moreover, a continuing sequence of gradual probes signals the
seriousness of the revisionist's intent to alter the status quo. In the
mind of the hegemon, the steady drumbeat of low- intensity and
peripheral incidents creates the impression that the revisionist both
has special claims for and may someday be willing to fight over a
particular piece of real estate. These claims are often backed up by
legal, historical, or ethnic justifications and a creeping physical
presence--- in Ukraine, Russian forces and equipment; in the South China
Sea, artificially created reefs. Over time, this places the onus of a
response on the shoulders of the hegemon and its allies in the region
for why the status quo should be maintained. For a weary hegemon like
the United States today, probes communicate that the act of supporting
the regional status quo is no longer cost free but will require a level
of exertion that was not needed in the past, inevitably leading to
questions of whether such effort and resulting escalation are
worthwhile. Nonetheless, it is certainly possible to see failed
instances of probing, which achieve the opposite of the revisionist
power's intentions. The historic scorecard of probing states is mixed. A
clear failure of probing would be if the targeted regional states and
offshore security patron responded strongly, tightening their alliance
and even initiating a direct **[war]{.underline}**. This [is **a**n
**unintended consequence**]{.underline} of a probe [and can take several
forms]{.underline}, from a tightening of alliances countering the
revisionist power to increased military contingency planning and
rearming. In the worst- case scenario, [it results in a combination of
actions that **counterbalance**]{.underline} the revisionist state more
effectively and forcefully than before the probing behavior started. The
revisionist state did not want nor expect this response before engaging
in probing. It amounts to a disconfirmation of the initial hypothesis
that the rival great power is in decline and retreat, and in the end it
worsens the strategic position of the probing state. The biggest loser
may thus be the probing power, which puts in motion a series of
strategic interactions that undermine its own strength. This was the
case of Germany in the early twentieth century. Kaiser Wilhelm's visit
to Tangier in 1905 initiated the first Moroccan crisis, manufactured by
Berlin to, among other objectives, probe the strength of the brand new
and untested Franco- British Entente Cordiale. 45 By challenging French
interests in Morocco in a nonviolent way, Berlin wanted to pressure
Paris, "the weakest link in the surrounding chain" of states opposing
Germany.46 But it desired to do that in an area and in a way that were
expected not to draw Great Britain into a direct confrontation, so that
Germany could demonstrate to Paris that the entente was in effect
useless. Morocco was important to France but not to Great Britain, and
the German Foreign Office expected that London would not back Paris.
Great Britain after all was also seen as retrenching after a bloody war
with the Boers and unable and unwilling to project power on land to
guarantee the security of its French quasi- ally. As Friedrich von
Holstein put it, the French would seek a rapprochement with Germany, in
effect bandwagoning, "when they have seen that English friendship . . .
is not enough to gain Germany's agreement to the French seizure of
Morocco, but rather that Germany wishes to be loved on its own account.
"47 Germany, however, greatly miscalculated the British need for a
continental ally and resulting commitment to France. The Moroccan crisis
was resolved in a multilateral conference in Algeciras where Berlin
ended in a position that was considerably worse than before the crisis:
its only support was from the weak Austro- Hungarian Empire, while
London was firmly and actively on the side of Paris. Instead of
weakening the nascent strategic friendship between Britain and France,
"German bullying" strengthened it.48 From then on, the "European Balance
of Power, which had been ignored for forty years, again dominated
British foreign policy; and henceforth every German move was interpreted
as a bid for continental hegemony. "49 London reoriented its attention
away from the empire and toward the European continent, gradually
planning to ready an expeditionary force to come to France's defense.50
Berlin's probe in Morocco turned into a clear failure.51 Probing is low
risk, insofar as it is tailored to minimize a strong reaction of the
rival, but it is not danger free for the revisionist state. Despite the
fact that it arises out of a desire to clarify an allegedly new map of
power, the effects of probing are difficult to interpret. [All parties
involved]{.underline}--- the revisionist power and the targeted
states--- [can **miscalculate**]{.underline} their reactions. In a case
of moral hazard, the [smaller states]{.underline}, directly targeted by
the revisionist power, may respond violently to the low- intensity
probe, feeling secure thanks to the alliance with a more powerful
patron. Or, [sensing that their distant patron is no longer capable of
maintaining]{.underline} its [influence, they may decide]{.underline}
the exact opposite [and accept the hegemony of the rival]{.underline}.
This was the case of Athenian allies in Thrace, switching sides under
General Brasidas's pressure and persuasion. They were mistaken because
their "judg ment was based more upon blind wishing than upon any sound
prediction. "52 Athens rallied and sent large forces north to restore
its sway. [The probing power can]{.underline} also be the one to
**[miscalculate]{.underline}**, either not seeing the success or
ignoring the failure. The nature of probing is such that the effects are
often not visible immediately and require time to alter the perceptions
and realities of power. The episode of Spartan commander Brasidas is
again telling. Sparta did not follow up on his successes, in part
because Spartan kings were jealous of his military exploits, but in part
because they thought the damage inflicted on Athens was sufficient to
strike a deal and end the war.53 They were of course wrong, as the war
continued for decades. Alternatively, despite being checked, the probing
power may simply up the ante, seeking some gain. This may have been the
case of Germany, which did not stop challenging France and Britain after
1905, despite its diplomatic isolation, the military conundrum of a two-
front war, and a robust Franco- British entente. In brief, there is no
easy single interpretation of a probe and its effects. [A related risk
is]{.underline} that a probe may lead [to an unintended and untimely
**escalation**]{.underline} of the strategic rivalry. As we described,
the purpose of probing is to see how permissive the geopolitical order
is, and to that goal a probe is limited in geographic reach and means
used. It targets an issue presumed peripheral to the rival great power,
seeking, for instance, a small territorial adjustment that is costly to
the weaker neighboring state but not deemed worthy of a direct conflict
by the distant and more powerful security patron. But the limited nature
of the probe is somewhat at odds with its ultimate purpose to check the
limits of an allegedly declining rival great power. A probe is a low-
intensity, local pinprick with wider repercussions; limited
geographically yet potentially global in outcome. The probing state has
a strong interest in keeping the crisis limited and circum scribed to
the narrowly defined area, but it is also poking the rival great pow er
to see what the reaction may be. It is banking on the fact that the
probe is on the periphery of the rival's influence and interests, and
thus that the rival will not escalate the interaction. The probing
challenger, in other words, is betting that its great power rival will
fear entrapment, being involved in an undesirable conflict, more than
loss of prestige, reputation, or influence. The revisionist power seeks
to use the fact of alliances (which it lacks itself) as a source of
competitive disadvantage for the hegemon. This is based on two
reinforcing perceptions--- first, that the commitment involved in their
maintenance is an encumbrance depriving the hegemon of strategic
flexibility; and second, that the hegemon's temptation to devalue its
own alliances suggests that it feels the weight of this encumbrance.
Probes therefore arise from a view that entrapment is the congenital
flaw of alliances. They are the ultimate act of attempting to expose the
dangers of entrapment to hegemon and ally alike. This is ultimately a
gamble--- an expectation, not a certainty. And [the gamble can
**backfire**]{.underline}, as there is always the possibility that [a
probe will result in a **dramatic escalation** since it is targeted at
**multiple audiences**]{.underline}. There is thus a clear recognition
that a probe has a much wider purpose than its immediate action may
convey, and consequently the desire to keep it limited runs against the
desire to have a much larger demonstrative effect. As a result, [the
interaction a probe initiates has an **inherent risk** of **escalating**
into a **much larger confrontation**]{.underline}.54 The revisionist
state neither desires nor expects the escalation, but its possibility
and perhaps likelihood are a direct outcome of probing. A probe by
definition crosses a limit, a tacit or an explicit line of influence, in
the expectation that it no longer reflects the actual will and power of
the rival state. The revisionist power tests limits that until then were
accepted and unchallenged and takes the first step in an "escalatory
ladder" of competitive behavior. For instance, Kaiser Wilhelm's support
of Boer independence in 1896 was a test of British strength in what
Berlin wrongly thought was a peripher al area of the British Empire.
Similarly, the Moroccan crisis in 1905 was a test of British commitment
to France in a region that should have been of no importance to London.
Both, however, were a "move in the European Balance of Power, " and
that, beyond the details of the individual probes, was becoming of
paramount concern to Great Britain. 55 Both were met by a strong British
response, intensifying the Anglo- British rivalry. Escalation here was a
willful choice of the targeted power. Finally, probing can be in many
cases a violent act, raising even further the likelihood of escalation
and war. Probing is a political act first and foremost, only at times
pursued by military means, but it does involve a careful application of
violence or threat of violence. This requires strict political control,
which is easier to maintain if the probe is not militarized and violent.
But the more violent it becomes, the more difficult it is to keep it
under political control. The logic of war may overwhelm the political
rationale. Bismarck was keenly aware that the limited wars he fought,
such as the Franco- Prussian one in 1870, would result in political
outcomes that were different from his objectives were other great powers
to become involved. But his greatest obstacle was the German military,
resentful of civilian interference in what they deemed to be affairs in
their exclusive purview. Political control over a limited war is
paramount, because otherwise operational war objectives can overwhelm
the larger political goals.56 The fact that Russia and China probe
through a variety of nontraditional means, such as fishing vessels in
the South China Sea and specially formed battalions (Vostok) of
Chechens, makes political control more difficult. There is an incentive
to use such means in a more aggressive way than would be warranted by
official state forces, because in case of defeat one can always deny
control over them and claim that they are simply individual citizens.
Moreover, the "civilian" paramilitary forces that the probing power uses
(e.g., the "Russian separatists" in eastern Ukraine) may not be easily
recalled if the conflict ceases to be useful. The civilianization of
conflict has its own risks. This makes probing behavior inherently
destabilizing to an international order, as it sets forces in motion
that, once unleashed, can be hard to control. [Probing can]{.underline},
moreover, [**spiral** into **war**]{.underline}, unexpected and perhaps
unwanted by the revisionist power. For instance, in the third century
BC, Rome started to probe Carthaginian power in Sicily. It extended
protection to Messana (or, more precisely, to a band of mercenaries, the
Mamertines, who controlled it), thereby asserting Roman influence in
northern Sicily. The peaceful withdrawal of the Punic garrison from the
area seemed to suggest that a war was avoidable and the probe successful
in attaining a low- cost revision to the balance of power. But the
Romans miscalculated and were emboldened by this small success. As
Polybius put it, they "now cherished the hope that they could drive the
Carthaginians out of Sicily altogether, and that once this goal was
attained their own power would be greatly increased. "57 Carthage sent a
large force to Sicily and solidified its alliance with Syracuse against
Rome and its new ally Messana. Rome then escalated and sent a large army
to besiege Syracuse, starting the first Punic war, which lasted more
than twenty years.58 What started as a low- cost, low- risk probe turned
into a long and costly slugfest. To sum up, the risk of probing is that
it may result in a slide toward a direct clash. [**Miscalculation** and
**escalation** by all parties involved can **elevate**]{.underline} what
is [a small, localized harassment into a **wider, more violent
war**]{.underline}. Moreover, a pattern of probing may gradually lead
all sides to accept war as necessary and perhaps inevitable, as each
probe and reaction escalates the competitive interaction.

**And a unified NATO stops every existential threat.**

[A **united NATO** is **critically important** to **projecting credible
deterrence**]{.underline}. The erosion of domestic trust and confidence
in the Alliance among its member states, including Canada, represents a
threat to this cohesion. A proposal to withdraw Canada from NATO was
tabled at a recent policy conference for one of Canada's three major
political parties. The proposal was defeated, but it represents a fringe
anti-NATO narrative within Canada's illiberal left; if left unaddressed,
such a narrative could grow.

[If countries like Russia **perceive NATO** as an **atomized
collection** of states with **varied priorities** rather than a
**unified front**, the Alliance is exposed to a **significant risk of
miscalculation** in which a foreign adversary might believe they can
**cross a red line** and only face a limited response.]{.underline}
Thus, [**gaps in cohesion** within the alliance **directly threaten** to
undermine political and **military** **deterrence**. The
Alliance]{.underline} and members states [must work towards **improving
communications strategies** to foster greater basic general
understanding of]{.underline} NATO's purpose, its missions and its role
in [protecting its members against **external threats.**]{.underline}

Similarly, if we see threats as atomized or disparate, we may lack the
capacity to adequately respond. **[Organized]{.underline}** GRU
**[terrorist attacks]{.underline}** in Czechia, the Salisbury
[poisonings, **transnational repression** and **censorship**,
**cyberwarfare**, **disinformation**, and **overt military posturing**
all pose threats that are aimed at]{.underline} the same essential goal:
[undermining and supplanting the power of **liberal democracy** and
**advancing authoritarianism**.]{.underline} Through this lens,
[challenges posed by other actors, including China, must also be
considered as part of the **broader range** of **shared threats** posed
to the **democratic community**]{.underline} as a whole.

[If we are to **succeed** in tackling these shared threats, **greater
transatlantic cooperation is needed**]{.underline}. It cannot remain
stagnant, however; [it must **evolve** and **expand**. The **serious
nature** of the threats, their potential to **become kinetic**, and the
possibility of **adversarial coordination**]{.underline} (whether formal
or informal) [means that we must **expand our tools** to meet these
challenges.]{.underline}

In the case of Ukraine, on whose border the Kremlin mobilized over
100,000 troops this past summer, the Alliance should consider extending
a Membership Action Plan despite the skepticism of some allies. Ukraine
must also be empowered in a similar fashion to frontline NATO states
like the Baltic states and Poland. After all, the eFP mission in Latvia
not only provides military deterrence, but strengthens interlinkages,
develops societal resilience, and provides clear and sustained
solidarity.

Finally, [the growing threats of **foreign interference**, **information
warfare**, **cyber attacks** and **emerging threats**]{.underline} to
Canada's Arctic [requires a **coherent long-term strategy** and an
evolved notion of **collective defence**]{.underline}, which includes
strengthening our partnerships with non-NATO allies in Europe, Asia, and
around the world.

#### The US [can't do it alone]{.underline} \-\-- [Cooperative integration]{.underline} with alliances is key

Joseph S. **Nye** **20**. Harvard University Distinguished Service
Professor, Emeritus. \"COVID-19's Painful Lesson About Strategy and
Power\". War on the Rocks. 3-26-2020.

In 2017, President Donald Trump announced a new National Security
Strategy that focused on great-power competition with China and Russia.
While the plans also note the role of alliances and cooperation, the
implementation has not. Today, COVID-19 shows that the strategy is
inadequate. Competition and an "[America First]{.underline}" approach
[is **not enough** to protect the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. [Close **coop**]{.underline}eration
[with]{.underline} both [allies]{.underline} and adversaries
[is]{.underline} also **[essential]{.underline}** for American security.
Under the influence of the information revolution and globalization,
world politics is changing dramatically. Even if the United States
prevails in the traditional great-power competition, it cannot protect
its security acting alone. COVID-19 is not the only example. Global
financial stability is vital to U.S. prosperity, but Americans need the
cooperation of others to ensure it. And while trade wars have set back
economic globalization, there is no stopping the environmental
globalization represented by pandemics and climate change. In a world
where borders are becoming more porous to everything from drugs to
infectious diseases to cyber terrorism, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [must use its **soft power**]{.underline} of
attraction [to develop **networks** and **institutions** that
**address**]{.underline} these **[new threats]{.underline}**. For
example, this administration proposed halving the U.S. contribution to
the World Health Organization's budget --- now we need it more than
ever. A successful national security strategy should start with the fact
that "America First" means [America has to **lead efforts at
coop**]{.underline}eration. A classic problem with public goods (like
clean air, which all can share and from which none can be excluded) is
that [if the largest consumer does not take the lead, **others will
free-ride** and]{.underline} the **[public goods will not be
produced]{.underline}**. As the technology expert Richard Danzig
summarizes the problem: [Twenty-first century technologies are global
not just in]{.underline} their [**distribution**, but also]{.underline}
in their [**consequences**. **Pathogens**, **AI systems**, **computer
viruses**, and **radiation**]{.underline} that others may accidentally
release [could become]{.underline} as much [our problem]{.underline} as
theirs. [**Agreed reporting systems**, shared **controls**, common
**contingency plans**, **norms** and **treaties** must be pursued as a
means of **moderating** our **numerous mutual risks**]{.underline}.
Tariffs and border walls cannot solve these problems. [While American
leadership is **essential** because of the country's global influence,
success will **require** the **coop**eration of others]{.underline}. [On
**transnational issues** like **COVID-19** and **climate
change**]{.underline}, power becomes a positive-sum game. It is not
enough to think of American power over others. [We must]{.underline}
also [think in terms of power to accomplish **joint
goals**]{.underline}, which involves power with others. On many
transnational issues, empowering others helps us to accomplish our own
goals. The United States benefits if China improves its energy
efficiency and emits less carbon dioxide, or improves its public health
systems. In this world, [**institutional networks** and
**connectedness** are an important source of
**info**]{.underline}rmation [and]{.underline} of **[national
power]{.underline}**, and the most connected states are the most
powerful. Washington has some sixty treaty allies while China has few.
Unfortunately, as Mira Rapp-Hooper recently argued, the United States is
squandering that power resource. In the past, the openness of the United
States enhanced its capacity to build networks, maintain institutions,
and sustain alliances. But will that openness and willingness to engage
with the rest of the world prove sustainable in the current populist
mood of American domestic politics? [Even if the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [possesses more]{.underline} hard [**military** and

[Terrorists are also making an **increasing use** of modern
technologies.]{.underline} [While there have been no cases of
'cyber-terrorism']{.underline} --ie, no proved terrorist act carried out
through cyber means only-- [terrorist groups have indeed used cyberspace
for recruitment and funding as well as operational
purposes]{.underline}. This is an area where intelligence agencies are
very busy and alert, although these activities are unlikely to reach the
level of sophistication and disruption that only State-sponsored groups
can achieve in this domain. [There is, however, a **growing concern**
about the possible use of unmanned vehicles for kinetic terrorist
attacks]{.underline} --and not only on the battlefield (where they have
already occurred) but also in civilian and especially urban
environments--. What happened around Christmas 2018 at Gatwick airport
in London was quite telling, especially in light of the commercial
affordability and availability of such tools and their potential impact
on civilian life. [NATO has just launched a **specific initiative** to
counter --on the battlefield but potentially also elsewhere-- such a
misuse of new technologies by terrorists.]{.underline}

[It's not just the United States that has unique offensive cyber
capabilities.]{.underline} In a March 27 speech, Mike Burgess,
Australia's director general of the Australia Signals Directorate,
[detailed](https://asd.gov.au/speeches/20190327-lowy-institute-offensive-cyber-operations.htm)
how his [government's hackers conducted operations against ISIS in Syria
to aid military ground forces as part of the global coalition to
defeat]{.underline} the [terrorist]{.underline} group. Burgess said this
was "the first time that an offensive cyber operation had been conducted
so closely synchronized with the movements of military personnel in
theater." The Australian offensive cyber operation took place in
conjunction with a ground raid on an Islamic State position and degraded
ISIS communications 11,000 km from the battlespace so commanders
couldn't connect to the internet or communicate with each other. The
speech was [first reported by the Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/03/29/the-cybersecurity-202-trump-wants-a-cybersecurity-moonshot-but-cuts-research/5c9d4b301b326b0f7f38f2b1/?utm_term=.2f952ed629d8).
The operation is similar to those described by U.S. officials, who have
detailed [operations conducted by U.S. Cyber Command as well as partner
forces supporting ground operations]{.underline} as part of the
coalition. In some cases, [U.S. officials have described the importance
of the partnerships and capabilities of other nations in these
contexts]{.underline} because sometimes [the United States **might not
have the authority** or the **access to conduct the cyber effect
itself.**]{.underline} "What we recognize is we have some **[foreign
partners]{.underline}** that [**give us very unique access or very
unique capabilities**. They operate off of different authorities that
compliment our own authorities]{.underline} so **[they are very, very
important]{.underline}**," Lt. Gen. Stephen Fogarty, commander of Army
Cyber Command, told reporters in October. "Episodic synchronization"
[The nature of remote cyber operations]{.underline}, despite common
conception, **[are incredibly arduous]{.underline}**. They involve first
gaining access to adversaries' networks, mapping those networks to
understand where things are and then figuring out how to degrade or
destroy portions of the network. Complicating matters further, if an
adversary changes portions of the network via a software patch --- an
anomaly with no physical world comparison --- the **[access gained could
be negated]{.underline}**. In the Australian example, Burgess said,
"While the effect was almost instantaneous, it took [weeks of planning
by specialist]{.underline} ASD and \[Australian Defense Forces\]
[personnel to make sure it **all went exactly to
plan**]{.underline}**."** Indeed, despite the success of the Australian
cyber operation and other similar operations detailed by U.S. officials,
others have lamented that such operations today take too long to plan
and only have a limited effect.

What would happen?** What should we do?," *Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists*, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2018.1436812)

But [the consequences would go far beyond the effects in the target
country]{.underline}, however, [and]{.underline} promptly **[propagate
worldwide]{.underline}**. [Global and national security, economy and
finance, international governance and its framework, national political
systems, and the behavior of governments and individuals would all be
put under **severe trial**]{.underline}. The severity of the effects at
a national level, however, would depend on the countries' level of
development, geopolitical location, and resilience. [Global security and
regional/national defense schemes would be strongly
affected]{.underline}. [An **increase in global distrust** would **spark
rising tensions** among countries and blocs]{.underline}, [that could
even lead to the **brink of nuclear weapons use** by states]{.underline}
(if, for instance, a sponsor country is identified). [The consequences
of]{.underline} such [a shocking scenario would include a **decrease in
states' self-control**]{.underline}, [an **escalation of present
conflicts** and the **emergence of new ones**, accompanied by an
**increase in military unilateralism** and military
expenditures]{.underline}. Regarding the economic and financial
impacts[, a **severe global economic depression** would rise from the
attack]{.underline}, likely **[lasting for years]{.underline}**. Its
duration would be strongly dependent on the course of the crisis. The
main results of such a crisis would include a 2 percent fall of growth
in global Gross Domestic Product, and a 4 percent decline of
international trade in the two years following the attack (cf. Figure
3). In the case of developing and less-developed countries, the economic
impacts would also include a shortage of high-technology products such
as medicines, as well as a fall in foreign direct investment and a
severe decline of international humanitarian aid toward low-income
countries. We expect an increase of unemployment and poverty in all
countries. Global poverty would raise about 4 percent after the attack,
which implies that at least 30 million more people would be living in
extreme poverty, in addition to the current estimated 767 million. [In
the area of international relations]{.underline}, [we would expect a
**breakdown of key doctrines** involving politics]{.underline},
[security, and relations among states]{.underline}. These
[**international tensions could lead to a collapse of the nuclear
order** as we know it today]{.underline}, [with a consequent **setback
of nuclear disarmament** and **nonproliferation
commitments**]{.underline}. In other words, [the whole system based on
the Nuclear **N**on- **P**roliferation **T**reaty would be put under
**severe trial**]{.underline}. [After the attack]{.underline}, [there
would be a reassessment of existing security doctrines]{.underline}, and
a deep review of concepts such as nuclear deterrence, no-firstuse,
proportionality, and negative security assurances. Finally, the behavior
of governments and individuals would also change radically. **[Internal
chaos]{.underline}** [fueled by the media and social networks would
**threaten governance at all levels**]{.underline}, [with greater impact
on those countries with weak institutional frameworks]{.underline}.
[**Social turbulence** would emerge in most countries]{.underline},
[with consequent **attempts by governments to impose restrictions on
personal freedoms to preserve order**]{.underline} -- possibly [by
declaring a state of siege or **state of emergency**]{.underline} -- and
[legislation would surely become tougher on human rights]{.underline}.
[There would]{.underline} also [be]{.underline} a **[significant
increase in social fragmentation]{.underline}** -- with a [deepening of
antagonistic views]{.underline}, [mistrust]{.underline}, [and
intolerance]{.underline}, both within countries and towards others --
and a [resurgence of large-scale social movements fostered by
ideological interests and **easily mobilized** through social
media]{.underline}.

[Ukraine's crisis]{.underline} [is]{.underline} ultimately [a part of a
**larger system of events**]{.underline} [in the East-European
region]{.underline}. Russia is conducting its foreign policy in the
region chiefly based on its perception of the ongoing events there and
their impact on Russia's foreign and domestic interests. [To achieve its
goals]{.underline}, [Russia is using various methods]{.underline} [to
influence the course of development that its neighbors choose to
pursue]{.underline}. [The methods now appear to include]{.underline},
among others, the combination of conducting the covert military
operations on the ground and in cyberspace, spreading of pro-Russian and
anti-Western disinformation domestically and internationally, as well as
**[attacking various elements]{.underline}** [of **critical
infrastructure**]{.underline} [and **exerting control
over**]{.underline} [the **national economies**]{.underline} [of the
**Eastern European states**]{.underline}.

While the West's economic sanctions against Russia are working, [the
Kremlin seems to retaliate in **increasingly aggressive
ways**]{.underline} [in **cyberspace**]{.underline} and on the ground
against Ukraine. With the presidential elections around the corner,
[Russia]{.underline} possibly [will **intensify** its **hybrid warfare
operations**]{.underline} [in the region]{.underline},
**[especially]{.underline}** [if Russia's **internal affairs** follows
**current unstable trajectory**]{.underline}.

[The pattern in Ukraine could be a **foreshadowing**]{.underline} [of
the **future for all states**]{.underline}. [The **number of
cyberattacks**]{.underline} [are **on the rise** and the **most
sophisticated**]{.underline} [among them have been attributed
to]{.underline} **[nation-state actors]{.underline}**.\[90\]
Nation-states have the resources and the intelligence available to
conduct multilayered and well-orchestrated attacks over long periods of
time. [The **evolving security threats** from cyberattacks]{.underline}
[led by nation-states range from **espionage**]{.underline} [to
**cyberattacks on critical infrastructure**]{.underline}. The motivation
to use cyberspace as a fifth domain of conflict is driven by relatively
low costs, the covert nature of cyber operations, and the strategic
advantage they present, as opposed to conventional warfare. Through
cyberattacks nation-states strive to achieve geopolitical and economic
goals that otherwise might seem unattainable to them.\[91\] The [Russian
attacks on]{.underline} Ukrainian **[electricity distribution

landscape and how embedded it is in existing geopolitical

Today the culprit in Texas and several other states is extreme winter
weather, but [the **greater threat**]{.underline} [we face is **not
weather related**]{.underline}. [It is the **daily
bombardment**]{.underline} [of **cyberattacks**]{.underline} [on our
nation's **critical infrastructure**]{.underline} --- [most notably on
the **electric sector**]{.underline} that [provides the power upon which
the rest of that infrastructure relies to operate]{.underline}.

[Just last December]{.underline}, [we learned that hackers linked to
Russia infiltrated numerous American companies and federal
agencies]{.underline}, including the Department of Homeland Security and
the Pentagon. Microsoft President Brad Smith told CBS News that, by its
analysis, the number of engineers required to pull off the now infamous
SolarWinds hack was "certainly more than 1,000."

Danger from Russia and China

Separately, [utility executives acknowledge their companies are

summer that [the National Security Agency issued a **warning** to
**critical infrastructure operators**]{.underline} [regarding
**cyberattack threats**]{.underline} [to **industrial control
systems**]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} quiet but **[unceasing barrage]{.underline}** [of
**sophisticated cyber intrusions** by **Russia**]{.underline}, China and
others, similar to the more high-profile situation in Texas today,
[highlight the fact that upgrading the U.S. electric grid needs to be a
national priority]{.underline}, and the cost of doing so should be
shared equitably by federal and state governments, electric utility
companies and consumers. Such a program could include grants,
low-interest loans and other incentives to dramatically improve and
modernize the grid.

Christian Vasquez, "Huge federal hack ripples across energy industry,"
E&E News, December 2020, https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063720933

[Electric utilities are **grappling**]{.underline} [with the
**fallout**]{.underline} [from one of the most **significant cyber
intrusions in years**]{.underline}, [as the **far-reaching
impact**]{.underline} [of a **sophisticated hacking
campaign**]{.underline} [comes into sharper focus]{.underline}.

Four days after the supply chain cyberattack on IT service provider
SolarWinds was revealed, [details]{.underline} on its global victims ---
from federal agencies to oil and electricity companies --- [are still
emerging]{.underline} (Energywire, Dec. 15).

[The SolarWinds software hijacked]{.underline} [by]{.underline}
suspected **[Russia-linked hackers]{.underline}** [was **widely used by
U.S. power providers**]{.underline}, experts say, [leaving many
companies scrambling]{.underline} [to find out if they\'re affected by
the breach]{.underline}. And sources say [a simple software
update]{.underline} or patch **[won\'t erase]{.underline}** [the
**threat**]{.underline} from the \"Sunburst\" malware: [Organizations
targeted by the hackers will]{.underline} likely [have **additional
malware installed**]{.underline} [that could be **difficult to
find**]{.underline}.

\"Any organization that says, \'Yep, we got it solved. It\'s all good,\'
in the next 90 days: I would respectfully disagree,\" said Jim Guinn,
global managing director for cybersecurity in energy, chemicals,
utilities and mining at Accenture.

The number of agencies and organizations that may have been hit by the
cyber espionage campaign is unclear. Reuters first reported that the
Commerce, Treasury and Homeland Security departments were among those
targeted. The list of agencies has since grown to include the State
Department and the Pentagon, The New York Times reported, citing
anonymous sources familiar with the ongoing investigations.

In a joint statement yesterday, DHS\'s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence said they have formed a \"Cyber Unified Coordination Group
to coordinate a whole-of-government response\" to the hacking campaign.

\"This is a developing situation, and while we continue to work to
understand the full extent of this campaign, we know this compromise has
affected networks within the federal government,\" the agencies said.

[The scope of customers]{.underline} [that used SolarWinds ranges from
**government agencies**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[Fortune 500
manufacturers]{.underline}** [and **power utilities**]{.underline}. In
an SEC filing, SolarWinds estimated that 18,000 or fewer customers
downloaded the malicious update containing the Sunburst malware.

According to federal records, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management had contracts with SolarWinds
in recent years. It\'s not clear if the Orion product was used and if
those agencies downloaded the malicious update. The Department of
Energy\'s Sandia and Oak Ridge national laboratories also used
SolarWinds, according to a now-deleted webpage listing the Austin,
Texas-based IT firm\'s customers.

DOE did not respond to requests for comment. FERC declined to comment.
BOEM deferred comment to DHS, which is leading the federal response to
the hack.

Utilities affected

[SolarWinds\' customer page]{.underline} also [listed the **New York
Power Authority**]{.underline} [as a client]{.underline}. [NYPA
confirmed it uses SolarWinds products]{.underline} and said they are
working in \"close collaboration with our industry cybersecurity
associations and government agencies\" to determine the potential
impact.

\"Our thorough analysis has so far determined that there are no adverse
impacts or exposures to our systems,\" an NYPA spokesperson said. \"We
continue to review our layered security controls to ensure that
activities associated with this threat are appropriately blocked and we
will take all necessary steps to secure our networks.\"

[The **scope of the breach**]{.underline} [has put **utilities across
the country**]{.underline} [on **high alert**]{.underline}. San
Francisco-based Pacific Gas and Electric Co. told E&E News that even
though they did not have SolarWinds products installed on their company
networks, \"out of an abundance of caution we conducted an assessment
and found no impacts or breach of our network resulting from this
attack,\" a PG&E spokesperson said.

The Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, whose energy industry
CEO members help coordinate the U.S. response to grid emergencies, held
a \"situational awareness call\" Monday on cyberthreats from SolarWinds.

Some critical infrastructure operators have already been hacked,
according to cybersecurity companies. Industrial cybersecurity firm
Dragos Inc. said that there are \"industrial entities compromised in
this campaign.\" Dragos has customers globally, and the company did not
specify where the victims were based.

**[Fully rebuilding trust]{.underline}** [in IT systems is going to be a
**long haul**]{.underline}, cybersecurity experts say, [and **rooting
out**]{.underline} [the **Sunburst malware**]{.underline} [is **just the
beginning**]{.underline}.

[The SolarWinds campaign began as early as **March**]{.underline},
according to cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. and Microsoft Corp.,
[meaning the hackers have had]{.underline} **[ample time]{.underline}**
[to **create additional backdoors**]{.underline} [and
**malware**]{.underline}.

In a statement yesterday, a FireEye spokesperson said that they have
discovered a \"kill switch\" in the Sunburst malware that can deactivate
it. FireEye also said that, alongside Microsoft and domain registrar
GoDaddy Inc., it had seized control over one of the internet domains
used by the hackers to send commands to compromised computers.

However, FireEye warned that the [hackers]{.underline} \"**[moved
quickly]{.underline}** [to **establish additional persistent
mechanisms**]{.underline} [to **access to victim
networks**]{.underline}\" --- [and the kill switch **won\'t cut
off**]{.underline} those other **[backdoors]{.underline}**.

\"You\'re talking about someone who broke into the Smithsonian and has
been there for eight months looking and figuring out which are the most
expensive pieces of art to steal,\" Accenture\'s Guinn said.

Guinn said [the **biggest threat**]{.underline} [from the hacking
campaign is]{.underline} not the Sunburst malware but [the]{.underline}
other **[potential backdoors]{.underline}** [that could have been
installed]{.underline}. [Utilities need to **assume**]{.underline}
[they\'ve been **compromised**]{.underline} and proactively hunt for
other possible cyberthreats, Guinn said --- a painstaking process that
could take months.

\"[Every one of the **critical utilities globally**]{.underline} [that
know that they have used these software packages]{.underline} \... [need
to take this **very seriously**]{.underline}. I would even say [to the
extent it would be as if it was a **massive outage**]{.underline},\"
Guinn said.

**Grid collapse is an [existential threat]{.underline}.**

happen in an apocalyptic blackout?," BBC Future, October 2019,
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191023-what-would-happen-in-an-apocalyptic-blackout

"So much of our lives and **[almost everything we do]{.underline}** [is
**now dependent on energy**]{.underline}, [and particularly on our
electricity supplies]{.underline}," says Juliet Mian, technical director
of the Resilience Shift, an initiative to help organisations and
individuals prepare for failures in critical infrastructure. "We used to
use the phrase 'when the lights go out', but the lights not working are
the least of our worries now." She is right. While the term "black sky"
events illustrates perhaps the most visible impact of widespread power
failures, it fails to convey the scale of the impact these can have. [In
our modern world]{.underline}, **[almost everything]{.underline}**,
[from our **financial systems**]{.underline} [to our **communication
networks**]{.underline}, [are **utterly reliant upon
electricity**]{.underline}. [**Other critical infrastructure** like
**water supplies**]{.underline} [and our sewer systems rely upon
electric powered pumps to keep them running]{.underline}. [With no
power]{.underline}, [fuel pumps at petrol stations stop
working]{.underline}, [road signs]{.underline}, [traffic lights and
train systems go dead]{.underline}. **[Transport networks]{.underline}**
[grind to a halt]{.underline}. [Our **complex food supply
chains**]{.underline} [quickly **fall apart** without]{.underline}
[computers to coordinate where produce needs to be]{.underline}, [or the
fuel to transport it or refrigeration to preserve it]{.underline}. [Air
conditioning]{.underline}, [gas boilers and heating systems also rely
upon electricity to work]{.underline}. A little over 100 years ago, our
cities ran on human and animal muscle power to ferry goods and waste
around. **[Modern infrastructure]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} now
**[utterly reliant upon electricity]{.underline}**. "In today's world,
[our systems are **highly interdependent**]{.underline} [and it is very
hard to find many systems that are not fundamentally reliant upon
power]{.underline}," says Mian. "A black sky scenario will affect
everyone." The causes of a black sky event are many. They vary from
natural disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes to geomagnetic storms
triggered by enormous flares from the Sun, or coronal mass ejections,
that send a barrage of electrically charged particles racing across the
Solar System and can overload electrical grids. One intense geomagnetic
disturbance caused a nine-hour outage across large areas of Canada in
1989. The Electric Infrastructure Security Council, an international
body that reviews threats to power grids, also lists a number of
**[human threats]{.underline}** that [**can trigger** a **mass black
out**]{.underline}. [These include **cyberterrorism
attacks**]{.underline} or coordinated physical assaults on energy
infrastructure such as power stations, and electromagnetic pulses that
can disable electricity grids. "Our national power grids are tremendous
feats of engineering and operations that have supported rapid economic
growth around the world," say Melissa Lott, a research fellow at the
Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York. "But
more investment is needed if electric power grids are going to keep up
with rapid technology shifts and increasingly extreme weather events."
She says that while true black sky events are mercifully rare, the deep
impact they have on businesses and people means more needs to not only
update grid technology and management, but also improve infrastructure
so it can be more resilient against physical threats like flooding. "In
the summer of 2012, blackouts in India cut power to more than 600
million people over two days. In Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria crippled
infrastructure across the island, leaving people in the dark and
triggering a humanitarian crisis. In 2018, an earthquake on Japan's
Hokkaido island left more than 5 million people without power. In order
to keep these events from becoming more common and to minimise their
impact, we need to invest in our grids." Putting measures in place to
counter all of these potential threats is difficult and expensive.
Critical systems can be guarded from human attacks and they can be
shielded from electromagnetic pulses with enough money being spent on
them. Building new systems for protecting transformers from coronal mass
ejections can also help to keep systems safe. But there are some events
that cannot be planned for and the complex, interconnected nature of our
electricity grids are remarkably vulnerable. Take what happened in
September 2003 when a fallen tree brought down a power line in
Switzerland's Lukmanier Pass over the Alps into Italy and 24 minutes
later another tree came down onto a line in the nearby Great St Bernard
pass. The sudden failure of these two key lines caused other connections
to Europe's electricity network to trip, which triggered power plants
across Italy to shut down. The whole of Italy was left without power
because of two fallen trees starting a cascade of events. Modern
electricity grids are increasingly interconnected and complicated,
making failures like this difficult to predict. **[Most of
Europe]{.underline}** [now runs off a **massive interconnected power
grid**]{.underline} -- probably the largest in the world -- [that
supplies more than 400 million customers in 24 countries]{.underline}.
The USA is made up of five different grids. But there are some that are
seeking ways of anticipating potential power failures and are enlisting
the help of artificial intelligence to help them grapple with this
highly complex problem. When a [power plant goes down]{.underline}, for
example, [it causes an **abrupt spike in load**]{.underline} [on others
on the network]{.underline}, [which in turn slows down the generators at
these plants]{.underline} [and causes the frequency held on the grid to
decrease]{.underline}. [This **risks destabilising**]{.underline} [the
delicate balance that electricity grids are held in]{.underline}, and
operators have to deploy countermeasures rapidly -- often within
milliseconds -- to prevent sections of the grid being cut off.
Researchers at the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft research institute in
Ilmenau, Germany, recently revealed they are developing an AI system to
automatically detect these disturbances and take steps to address them.
The US Department of Energy is also funding \$7m (£5.4m) of research
into using artificial intelligence to not only predict potential outages
and spot anomalies that might lead to larger problems, but also to help
find ways of keeping supplies constant in the event of a problem.
General Electric is using machine learning to help analyse weather
forecasts past outage history and information on the ground from its
response crews to predict the impact that impending storms might have on
its networks. It is also using it to predict where its repair crews
might need to be so that downed lines can be restored more quickly.
Power grids can also help to protect themselves by increasing the amount
of energy storage such as large scale batteries they have available so
that supplies can be supplemented when generators do go off-line
unexpectedly. But completely protecting our power networks from failures
is almost impossible, says Mian. "We can't necessarily design our
systems so that failures don't happen," she says. "There's so much
complexity in our systems these failures can cascade and they can become
much more widespread, which means the failure is quite often
unavoidable. But what we can do is design our systems so that they can
respond and recover quickly." This is what the Resilience Shift is now
trying to improve. It has been organising exercises in collaboration
with the Electric Infrastructure Security Council (EIS) that help large
organisations, universities, schools, community groups and even families
prepare themselves for an event that might lead to mass power cuts for
several days at a time. The Emergency All-sector Response Transnational
Hazard Exercise, or Earth Ex, is an online exercise that allows people
to rehearse the decisions they need to make and put in place the plans
they need should the worst happen. (Try Earth Ex for yourself and see
how prepared you are.) "We want people to be thinking about these things
long before there is a problem," says John Heltzel, director of
resilience planning at the EIS. "It's important because when the
electricity grid fails, there is this risk of cascading impacts that can
occur from what might at first seem to be a relatively minor event.
[This **cascade effect** is]{.underline} [where the **real damage can be
done**]{.underline}. As the people of Venezuela have discovered, [even
basic service like water can stop when the power goes out]{.underline}.
"[It's]{.underline} effectively \[[like **going**]{.underline}\] **[back
to the dark ages]{.underline}**," says Heltzel. A report by scientists
at University College London mapped out how the loss of power can filter
through communities, from the loss of health care provision and
sanitation services to citizens trapped in lifts and disruption to
transport systems. Then [there are]{.underline} the **[social
consequences]{.underline}** [that percolate out]{.underline}. **[Crime
rates]{.underline}** [often go up during blackouts as they provide
opportunities for theft and fraud]{.underline}. [The supply of cash and
credit]{.underline} -- particularly in our modern societies so reliant
upon electronic and card payments -- **[dry up]{.underline}** meaning
people have to rely on whatever cash they happen to have squirreled
away. **[Communication networks and]{.underline}** the ability to
contact loved ones **[disappear]{.underline}**, [while vulnerable people
like the elderly are often left stranded in their own
homes]{.underline}. **[Businesses]{.underline}** [are also left largely
**unable to operate**]{.underline}, [resulting in **huge economic
impacts**]{.underline}. In 2004, the Department of Energy estimated the
annual cost of power outages in the US to be around \$80bn (£62bn)
annually. When two million customers in California had their supplies
cut for two days in October this year, experts estimated the cost to the
economy to be around \$2.5bn (£1.9bn).

### 2AC \-\-- Iran A/O

**[Iran]{.underline} will escalate [GPS attacks]{.underline}, causing
[escalation]{.underline} in the Persian gulf**

Micah **Halpern 2019**, former lecturer @ Yale, has also taught at
Brandeis University and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, political
and foreign affairs commentator, 8 August 2019, "Iran Plays a Dangerous
Hi-Tech Game,"
https://www.newsmax.com/micahhalpern/strait-of-hormuz-jamming-centcom/2019/08/08/id/927875/

[Iran]{.underline} is playing dirty tricks in and around the Strait of
Hormuz.

To begin with, they [are]{.underline} **[jamming the GPS of
tankers]{.underline}**, [causing ships to wander off course]{.underline}
---and in to their waters. [They are also]{.underline} **[spoofing
andradioing the vessels]{.underline}**, [proporting to be friendly and
even]{.underline} **[U.S. navy ships]{.underline}**.

Over the years [the]{.underline} [Iranian leadership has perfected the
art of mixing and matching partial truths with outright lies in order to
advance their agenda]{.underline}. They want to convince global
observers that it is the Iranian leadership who are the innocent
victims, innocent victims targeted by organized Western aggression.

In this case [Iranians are deliberately]{.underline} dogging, misleading
and **[luring ships off course]{.underline}**.

[Their actions have turned into]{.underline} **[a war of
jamming]{.underline}**.

Like most everything else they engage in, for Iran this is serious
business.

[Globally this is]{.underline} **[extremely dangerous]{.underline}**.
[We are seeing signs]{.underline} **[all over the
Mideast]{.underline}**.

The U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Division published a
public warning to all ships and companies traveling in the region
alerting them that [Iran]{.underline} \"[spoofed bridge-to-bridge
communications from unknown entities falsely claiming to be U.S. or
coalition warships]{.underline}.\"

U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement, \"[Due to the
heightened regional tensions]{.underline}, **[the potential for
miscalculation]{.underline}** or misidentification **[could lead to
aggressive actions]{.underline}** [against vessels belonging to US,
**allied** and coalition partners operating in the]{.underline}
**[Arabian Gulf]{.underline}**, **[Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}**,
**[and Gulf of Oman]{.underline}** . . . **[GPS
interference]{.underline}**, bridge-to-bridge communications
**[spoofing]{.underline}**, [and/or other communications jamming with
little to no warning]{.underline}.\"

Bridge-to-bridge communication is when ships speak to one another.

[Iran has been become]{.underline} **[expert]{.underline}** [at
jamming]{.underline}.

That shouldn't come as a big surprise given that as far back as 2012 the
Iranian government has been jamming their own citizens. Back then, Iran
replaced a series of short flagpoles scattered around their country with
huge flagpoles -- all the better to hide their jamming devices.

The newer, taller, flagpoles sprouted up almost everywhere. The Iranian
regime was attempting to stop all forms of social media and messaging.
Their citizens were using satellites to communicate and find out the
truth about what was happening in the world and that was not what
Iranian leadership wanted.

[The]{.underline} **[Russians]{.underline}**, too, [have
become]{.underline} **[very good at GPS jamming]{.underline}**.
Intelligence analysts report that [Russia is jamming not waterways, but
airspace, specifically the airspace around]{.underline}
**[Syria]{.underline}**. [And that means that Russia is now capable of
jamming communication for the **new US stealth fighter jet, the
F-35**]{.underline}. This may be an exaggeration -I am skeptical that
Russia is that sophisticated.

Even more worrisome than all of this is a report that was issued this
summer by the International Federation of Airline Pilots Association.
The report details that pilots, landing in Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport
in Israel, have lost GPS and that it is a recurring phenomenon.

Thankfully, there are alternative tools that can be used to land and
take off. Israel has said that they are dealing with the issue. But [the
mere presence of this issue demonstrates that we now live in a world
hampered]{.underline} --- **[dangerously so]{.underline}**, **[by a
significant threat of jamming]{.underline}**. [And this jamming can and
is affecting more than ships at sea and military drones and jets in the
sky, it is also targeting civilian aircraft with hundreds of civilian
passengers aboard]{.underline}.

When it comes to tech, Iran is highly skilled.

They are developing their own tools and are using and adapting Russian
and North Korean tech.

**[Jamming]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[spoofing by
Iran]{.underline}** [explains quite a lot of what has been happening in
the Strait of Hormuz]{.underline}. [Iran does not play games for
fun]{.underline}. And this time, as always, [the Iranians are
playing]{.underline} by their own rules and they are playing **[to
win]{.underline}**.

**Goes [nuclear]{.underline}**

[Tensions between the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and Iran are]{.underline} **[spiraling toward
a military confrontation]{.underline}** [that carries a]{.underline}
**[real possibility]{.underline}** [that the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [will use]{.underline}
**[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. [Iran's assortment of asymmetrical
capabilities]{.underline}---[all constructed to be effective against
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates---[nearly assures such a
confrontation]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [current US nuclear
posture leaves the]{.underline} [Trump administration]{.underline} at
least [open to the use of]{.underline} **[tactical nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[conventional
theaters]{.underline}**. [Some in the current administration may well
think it to be in the best interest]{.underline} of the United States
[to seek a quick and decisive victory]{.underline} in the oil hub of the
Persian Gulf---and to do so by **[using its nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}**.

[We believe there is a heightened possibility]{.underline} of a US-Iran
war triggering a US nuclear strike [for the following
reasons]{.underline}:

[The sanction regime]{.underline} set against the Iranian economy [is so
brutal that it is likely to force Iran to take an action that will
require a US military response]{.underline}. Unless the United States
backs down from its present self-declared "economic warfare" against
Iran, this will likely escalate to an open warfare between the two
countries.

In response to a White House request to draw up an Iran war plan, the
Pentagon proposed sending 120,000 soldiers to the Persian Gulf. This
force would augment the several thousands of troops already stationed in
Iran's vicinity. President Trump has also hinted that if need be, he
will be sending "a lot more" troops. Defeating Iran through conventional
military means would likely require a half million US forces and US
preparedness for many casualties. The US nuclear posture review is
worded in such a way that the use of tactical nuclear weapons in
conventional theaters is envisaged, foreshadowing the concern that in a
showdown with a menacing foe like Iran, the nuclear option is on the
table. The United States could once again justify using nuclear force
for the sake of a decisive victory and casualty-prevention, the logic
used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

[Trump's]{.underline} **[cavalier attitude toward nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, **[trigger-happy penchant]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[utter disdain for Iran]{.underline}**, [show that
he would likely have no moral qualm about issuing an order
to]{.underline} **[launch a limited nuclear strike]{.underline}**,
**[especially in a US-Iran showdown]{.underline}**, one in which the oil
transit from the Gulf would be imperiled, impacting the global economy
and necessitating a speedy end to such a war.

### 2AC \-\-- UQ \-\-- Russian Attacks

**Russian cyberattacks are [increasing now]{.underline} because of an
[uncoordinated US response strategy]{.underline} and perceived [lack of
consequences]{.underline} for cyber-aggression\-\--that ensures
[catastrophic]{.underline} Russian cyberattacks on critical
infrastructure [and]{.underline} kinetic retaliation.**

**Rondeaux 20** -- Senior fellow and professor of practice at the Center
on the Future of War, a joint initiative of New America and Arizona
State University

Candace Rondeaux, "Why Is the U.S. Still So Vulnerable to Russian
Cyberattacks?," World Politics Review, December 2020,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/29298/why-is-the-u-s-still-so-vulnerable-to-a-russian-cyber-attack

To call the revelations about Russia's devastating cyberattack on U.S.
government agencies and thousands of American businesses chilling would
be a gross understatement. What is even scarier, though, is that
[despite **wave after wave** of]{.underline} **[Russian-sponsored
cyberattacks]{.underline}** [on the United States and its
allies]{.underline} for more than a decade now, [Washington
still]{.underline} apparently **[lacks]{.underline}** [the **political
will** to **defend against**]{.underline} [this **Russian
aggression**]{.underline}.

It is possible and even probable that this latest attack will provoke a
strong response from the U.S. and its allies, as some have suggested. As
well it should. After all, the breach of the network monitoring software
made by Texas-based SolarWinds, which has been widely attributed to
Russia's SVR intelligence agency, targeted the digital information
architecture of several federal agencies, including the National
Security Agency and the departments of Homeland Security, Treasury,
Commerce and State. It also affected an estimated 18,000 companies with
SolarWinds accounts, including several on the Fortune 500 list.

Over the coming weeks and months, the scope and scale of the cyberattack
will become clear. It has already produced fallout for SolarWinds
longtime CEO Kevin Thompson, who announced his resignation last week.
And if news reports are any guide, the Russian hack could trigger a
federal investigation into suspected insider trading, since some
SolarWinds shareholders apparently cashed in right before news of the
breach became public. But it is easy to imagine much worse scenarios.
Second- and third-order effects of the cyberattack might include, for
instance, leaks of sensitive information---or worse, sabotage of
America's critical infrastructure, such as electrical grids or banking
systems.

Yet [given the U.S. government's **poor** and **well-documented track
record**]{.underline} [to date on **developing**]{.underline} [and
**implementing** a **comprehensive strategy**]{.underline} [for
**cyberspace**]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline} also equally possible
and far more **[likely]{.underline}** [that whatever]{.underline}
immediate [response]{.underline} [the outgoing Trump administration and
the incoming Biden administration come up with]{.underline}, [it will
**fall well short** of]{.underline} [what is required to **mitigate**
the **risks** of **more attacks**]{.underline}. That is because what is
really needed is not just a response from the White House, but
legislative action from Congress, an institution that has failed time
and again to develop a sound cyber strategy or build proper cyber
defenses. Instead Congress has allowed the politics of the petty,
personal and partisan to paralyze this country in its time of greatest
crisis.

While the latest move in Russia's global cyber offensive exposed a fatal
flaw in the way Washington formulates its national security priorities,
it also reflects a major Kremlin miscalculation. [There is a lot of
noise around the signal Moscow keeps trying to send with these
attacks]{.underline}. But [what still **comes through
clearly**]{.underline} [is a **misplaced belief** among]{.underline}
**[Russian leadership]{.underline}** [that there will be **no more
costs**]{.underline} [or **consequences**]{.underline} [for its
**continued provocations**]{.underline}. [What]{.underline} President
Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} apparently **[fails to see]{.underline}**
[is that the **further up the escalation ladder**]{.underline} [Russia's
security agencies climb with their cyberattacks]{.underline}, [the
**more likely** it]{.underline} [is that Russia]{.underline}'s sovereign
wealth will **[wind up in America's crosshairs]{.underline}**, through
retaliatory sanctions and other financial restrictions.

More ominously, [the options in terms of non-military responses narrow
considerably]{.underline} after that. [No one on either side wants to go
there]{.underline}, and everyone in the middle---the European Union
especially---is rightfully afraid of such an outcome. [But]{.underline}
[it is not hard to imagine that the **release of sensitive
data**]{.underline} [acquired from]{.underline} the SolarWinds breaches,
or [a **second wave attack**]{.underline}, [could trigger such a
scenario]{.underline}. [Even if the outcomes were more
subtle]{.underline}---[say]{.underline}, [a **series** of
**slow-burning**]{.underline} [and **targeted attacks**]{.underline}
[against American]{.underline} [citizens]{.underline} and institutions,
[or]{.underline} [against allied states]{.underline} that Moscow deems
particularly troublesome, or, perhaps, leveraging stolen data to foment
discord among NATO members---[**more cyberattacks**
attributed]{.underline} [to Russia will only **harden the
position**]{.underline} [of **hawks** who might **advocate for military
escalation**]{.underline}.

Putin is correct to surmise that any U.S. calculations about retaliating
against these cyberattacks will always factor in other challenges, like
the multitrack diplomacy required on everything from nuclear weapons to
space to climate change, for which the U.S. still needs Russian
cooperation. [It is **folly**]{.underline}, however, [to assume that the
divide and conquer tactics Russia has fomented through its global
disinformation campaign]{.underline} [will lead to **permanent American
paralysis**]{.underline}. [With **systemic attacks**]{.underline} [on
**supply chains** or **critical infrastructure**]{.underline}, [it only
**takes one misstep**]{.underline} [to **produce catastrophic collateral
damage**]{.underline} or real human casualties. In fact, the
hollowed-out state of American diplomacy after four years of Donald
Trump should scare Putin more than it does, because ever since 9/11, the
Pentagon hammer has rarely seen a nail it doesn't want to pound.

Americans should be even more scared, especially Wall Street. In fact, a
brief review of how we got here might be useful. The internet has been
up and running since 1969, when it was first developed by the Pentagon's
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. When Tim
Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989, he transformed what was
a rather clunky, albeit advanced, telecommunications system into a
world-shattering, paradigm-shifting technological juggernaut. Since
then, there have been hundreds, if not thousands of state-sponsored
cyberattacks, according to the Council on Foreign Relations' handy cyber
operations tracker. At the same time, the digital revolution and birth
of the online marketplace have generated billions for Wall Street, and
trillions for the American economy. That doesn't mean it will remain
that way forever.

The data would seem to indicate that China, Russia, the U.S. and Iran
stand out as the biggest players on the pitch when it comes to cyber
operations. Yet to date, not one of these countries has stepped forward
to say that it's time to hold a global summit on the future of
cyberspace. All that has been done is a lot of tinkering and dickering
with policy nonstarters at the United Nations. There has been zero bold
thinking---just a lot of authoritarians genuflecting in front of the
false god of "cyber sovereignty" and chaotic clutch plays from more
democratically inclined states. This state of affairs is likely to
continue for the foreseeable future, despite all its risks

[Only time will tell whether the **perilous state**]{.underline} [of
**America's cyber defenses**]{.underline} and the pitiable lack of a
national strategy to safeguard its supply chains from asymmetric attacks
**[further accelerates]{.underline}** [America's **decline** as a
**major world power**]{.underline}. At least some part of [the problem
can be **attributed**]{.underline} [to the **appalling
ignorance**]{.underline} [at the **federal**]{.underline}, state and
local [level of the technological innovations]{.underline} [that drive
the American economy and what it takes to protect them]{.underline}. No
doubt, the power-hungry habits of a tech industry that has repeatedly
resisted calls to work in earnest with government to build comprehensive
solutions to managing cyber risks are also partly to blame. At bottom,
however, [the torpid U.S. government response]{.underline} [to
state-sponsored cyberattacks **screams out**]{.underline} [for a
**wholesale rethink** of what constitutes American vital
interests]{.underline}.

There are plenty of good ideas out there for shoring up America's cyber
defenses. [This latest attack will]{.underline} surely only [serve as a
**rallying cry**]{.underline} [in support of the **consensus
view**]{.underline} [that the **most urgent work**]{.underline} [is
needed at the **federal level**]{.underline}. One of the best ideas to
surface in the last couple days comes from the head of the Stanford
Internet Observatory, Alex Stamos. He has urged the U.S. government to
form "the cyberspace equivalent of the National Transportation Safety
Board" that, instead of looking into the causes of plane crashes and
train wrecks, "would track attacks, conduct investigations into the root
causes of vulnerabilities and issue recommendations on how to prevent
them in the future."

[**Malicious cyber activity** has **increased substantially** over the
past years, ranging from **ransomware** and **espionage** to
**politically motivated cyberattacks** and **sophisticated
malware**]{.underline} used [in]{.underline} the war in [Ukraine. NATO
allies must remain on **high alert.**]{.underline}

The changed nature of military conflict changes the defensive mission of
NATO, which faces capable opponents in cyberspace and raises the
question of how to create accountability when a hostile state fails to
observe globally agreed norms.

The set of action for NATO for the next five years evolves around how to
impose costs and how to deny benefits against malicious actors in
cyberspace.

Introduction

What the war in Ukraine says about cyber power is yet not entirely
cleared from the fog of war. Many aspects remain uncertain, but [given
the **unpredictability** of the Putin regime, the **risk of an
escalation** in hostile cyber exchanges between **Russia** and **NATO**
states **remains high**.]{.underline} What is clear is that, [as of
February 24, 2022, we live in a different world in which the
**European** and **global security orders** have been
**shattered**.]{.underline}

This brief first explores the challenge that cyber threats pose to NATO
allies and how the rapidly evolving cyber-threat landscape can alter the
international security environment. Secondly, it looks at developments
in cyber defense policy within NATO. Finally, the brief analyzes how
[**NATO needs to adapt** to address cyber challenges]{.underline},
studying how allies align their sovereign interests, capabilities, and
cyber doctrines with NATO operational requirements and strategic
ambitions. NATO is set to issue strategic documents in 2022 that will
guide the next decade of its military planning. [This will **certainly**
require **more transatlantic consultation**]{.underline} on
political-military matters [with an emphasis on cyber security and cyber
defense.]{.underline}

Cyber Challenge to World and NATO Allies

[Malicious cyber activity has **increased substantially** over the past
years while the world has kept turning amid the **omnipresent pandemic**
and now **war in Ukraine**]{.underline}. States, non-state actors, and
criminal groups compete and are increasingly weaponizing sensitive
information and infiltrating other countries' networks to steal data,
seed misinformation, or disrupt critical infrastructure.

The coronavirus pandemic further complicated the cyber-threat landscape.
In March 2020, attempts to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus led to
social distancing measures, travel restrictions, and remote work. In a
short span of time, IT security professionals had to respond to the
challenges of working from home, such as enterprise data movements when
employees accessed cloud-based apps via their home internet, corporate
software, videoconferencing, and file sharing.1 Even if hardware and
software solutions were in place to secure the organization's data,
there were often no established policies to help employees wade through
the jungle of threats and vulnerabilities they faced when moving their
workplace out of the traditional office environment.2

According to the FireEye Mandiant Special Report: M-Trends 2021, the top
five most targeted industries in 2020 were business and professional
services, retail and hospitality, finance, healthcare, and high
technology. The main methods used were extortion, ransom demands,
payment card theft, and illicit transfers. Direct financial gain was the
likely motive for 36% of intrusions, and an additional 2% of intrusions
were likely perpetrated to resell access. In 2021, data theft remained
an important mission objective for threat actors; in 32% of intrusions,
adversaries stole data.3

Currently, [highly organized, technically proficient **criminal
syndicates** comprise the **most significant cyber threat** to
allies.]{.underline} These groups try to steal data or extort money
through ransomware. [In 2021, prominent ransomware attacks struck
Colonial Pipeline]{.underline}, the operator of the largest fuel
pipeline on the East Coast of the United States; [JBS]{.underline}, the
largest meat processing company in North America; and
[Coop]{.underline}, a major supermarket chain in Sweden. Healthcare was
also targeted---in May of the same year, [the entire health service
system of Ireland]{.underline} was disrupted for weeks, and over the
spring and summer, dozens of hospitals in Europe and the United States
were locked out of life-critical systems by ransomware attacks.4

[Another set of threats comes in the form of **belligerent state
actors** that seek to **steal sensitive data for
espionage**]{.underline}. In December 2020, Russian intelligence
services infiltrated the digital systems run by US tech firm
[SolarWinds]{.underline} and inserted malware into its code. During the
company's next software update, the virus was inadvertently spread to
about 18,000 clients, including large corporations, the Pentagon, the
State Department, Homeland Security, the Treasury, and other US
government agencies. The [hack went undetected for months]{.underline}
before the victims discovered vast amounts of their data had been
stolen.5

[There are also **politically motivated cyberattacks** mandated by
states that **interfere in democratic processes** and **political
discourse**]{.underline}. In September 2020, the internal email system
of Norway's parliament was hacked.6 Ine Eriksen Søreide, the Minister of
Foreign Affairs of Norway, underlined the significance of the attack by
calling it an important cyber incident that affected the "most important
democratic institution" of the country.7 Norwegian authorities later
identified Russia as the actor responsible for the attack, marking the
first time that Norwegian authorities had made a political attribution
to such an attack.

Since the beginning of this year, [Ukraine's government has been hit by
a series of cyberattacks that **defaced government websites** and
**wiped out** the data on some government computers]{.underline}. In
mid-January, hackers defaced about 70 Ukrainian websites, including the
Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, Energy, Education, and Science,
as well as the State Emergency Service and the Ministry of Digital
Transformation, whose e-governance portal gives the Ukrainian public
digital access to dozens of government services. The hackers replaced
the home pages of about a dozen sites with a threatening message: "be
afraid and expect worse." After a couple of days, however, most of the
sites were restored.8 The international hacktivist collective Anonymous
has declared "cyberwar" against Russia's government, claiming credit for
several cyber incidents including distributed denial of service attacks
that took down Russian government websites and Russia Today, the
state-backed news service.9

[The **most worrying type** of cyberattack is **sophisticated malware**
designed by states or state-backed actors that act as "**time bombs**"
in the critical cyber networks of target countries, such as the
**energy**, **telecom**, and **transportation** sectors]{.underline}.
Around the globe, aging [critical infrastructure has **long been
vulnerable** to attack.]{.underline} In 2020, the UK's National Cyber
Security Centre issued a warning of Russian attacks on millions of
routers, firewalls, and devices used by infrastructure operators and
government agencies.10

[On the day of the Russian invasion, ViaSat, a provider of high-speed
satellite broadband services, was **hacked** along with one of its
satellites Ka-Sat, whose users included Ukraine's **armed forces,
police, and intelligence service**. Destructive wiper malware attacks by
Russia against]{.underline} Ukraine included WhisperGate, discovered in
January by Microsoft, in [Ukraine's networks that "**provide critical
executive branch** or **emergency response functions"**]{.underline};11
HermeticWizard and IsaacWiper,12 targeting multiple Ukrainian
organizations just hours before the Russian invasion began; and
CaddyWiper, spotted by researchers at the Slovak internet security
company ESET in mid-March.13 All of them were designed to wipe or
overwrite critical files on infected systems and leave computer hard
drives corrupted and unrecoverable. These [incidents demonstrate
that]{.underline}, in the words of cyber expert and Silverado Policy
Accelerator think tank chairman Dmitri Alperovich, "[Cyberattacks have
become a **theater for great-power conflict** in which governments and
militaries fight in the **hybrid 'gray zone,**' where the boundaries
between peace and war are **blurred**]{.underline}."14 The actors
navigate a complex web of ambiguous and deeply interconnected
challenges, where [cyberattacks are **not a separate front,** but rather
an **extension of the conflict.**]{.underline}

[NATO thinking on deterrence]{.underline} today, even more than in the
Cold War, [should]{.underline} go beyond conventional and nuclear
weapons to [encompass cyber and other gray-zone threats]{.underline}.
[Offensive cyber capabilities offer the means to inflict strategic
effects without the direct use of military force]{.underline} --- such
as by disabling nuclear missiles in their launchers or by destroying or
disrupting reconnaissance and command-and-control systems. [Cyber
capabilities]{.underline} complement the more traditional basket of
tools [used by Russia to destabilize its adversaries below the level of
armed conflict]{.underline} (such as political subversion, economic
sabotage, disinformation, and fomenting separatism). [Russia
uses]{.underline} these so-called [hybrid means to undermine states and
alliances]{.underline}, [damage infrastructure]{.underline}, and [erode
social cohesion]{.underline}, all while concealing the identity of the
attacker.26 NATO has sought to deter cyber aggression, first of all, by
declaring that even though the Washington Treaty refers to "armed
attack" as the basis for

NATO action under Article 5, a cyber attack could inflict sufficient
damage to be considered the functional equivalent of an armed attack,
triggering Article 5.27 Beyond this, [deterrence in the gray
zone]{.underline} may **[depend on developing the capability to inflict
equal or greater damage in response to large-scale cyber
aggression]{.underline}** and to [make clear that NATO reserves the
right to react symmetrically]{.underline} ([i.e]{.underline}., **[cyber
versus cyber]{.underline}**) or asymmetrically, to include kinetic and
non-kinetic options such as sanctions. In this regard, the adapted NATO
Command Structure includes a new 24/7 cyber operations center at its
main headquarters and allies have agreed that **[NATO]{.underline}**'s
Supreme Allied Commander for Europe can [**turn to nations with
offensive cyber capabilities if needed** in a conflict]{.underline}.28

Deterring gray-zone threats poses a more difficult challenge. Efforts to
define a "red line" of conflict that must not be passed by nature
encourage adversaries to take action perceived as below the red line.
[On the deterrence side]{.underline}, [ambiguity and flexibility can
help]{.underline}, but [**more important** will be to strengthen allied
nations' own resilience]{.underline} --- to harden critical
infrastructure, reduce societies' vulnerability to subversion and
disinformation, expose and shut down the movement of dark money and
other sources of corruption, and **[improve]{.underline}** internal
security and **[intelligence sharing within governments and across the
NATO alliance]{.underline}**. [Allies]{.underline} also [need to be more
effective in pushing back against Russian disinformation and
propaganda]{.underline}.29 NATO-E.U. cooperation on combating
disinformation and establishing centers of excellence, such as the
European Center of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (Finland),
the NATO Strategic Communications center of excellence (Latvia), and the
NATO Energy Security center of excellence (Lithuania) are all important
steps in this regard.

b\. Recommendations As Matthijs Veenendaal, Kadri Kaska, and Pascal
Brangetto (2016) note, [cyber capabilities are still regarded as
**strategic assets by most states**. Because of the secrecy of these
capabilities, states are reluctant to delegate the authority to use
them]{.underline}, particularly in offensive operations. For instance,
[**in the United States**, "only the President can approve a
cyber-attack]{.underline} likely to result in 'significant
consequences.' However, [this does not mean that these capabilities are
irrelevant to **NATO**]{.underline} and NATO-led
**[operations]{.underline}**" (Veenendaal et al., 2016). [NATO must plan
for the "contingency of nations wanting to deploy them]{.underline}
during a NATO-led military operation" (Veenendaal et al., 2016).
However, [without information sharing and knowing the level of possible
contribution]{.underline} of an allied member, it [will be **very
difficult** to **plan** for possible **cyber scenarios** and **react
swiftly**]{.underline} to cyber-attacks against NATO and its members.
Handling "the need for secrecy or political sensitivity concerning
specific military operations is not new for the Alliance" (Veenendaal et
al., 2016). To enhance a full-fledged cyber doctrine, it would be
beneficial to check the NATO Allied Joint Doctrine for Special
Operations. It states in its introduction that special operations may be
described as military activities conducted by specially designated,
organized, trained, and equipped forces using operational tactics,
techniques, and modes of employment not standard to conventional forces.
Politico-military considerations may require low prominence, covert or
discreet techniques, and the acceptance of a degree of physical and
political risk not associated with conventional operations. (Veenendaal
et al., 2016) The [approach for s**pecial operations** is applicable for
NATO to develop **information sharing** among members for cyber
operations. NATO has the **capacity** to develop a **sound
doctrine**,]{.underline} which deals with unconventional small sized
units depending on secret information and conducting clandestine
operations. [Countries hesitate to **share information** because of
their **vulnerabilities**]{.underline} in the cyber domain;
[however]{.underline}, if NATO becomes a more powerful cyber actor,
[**willingness to share information among members will increase**, and
the **bonds of NATO members** will strengthen.]{.underline}

### 2AC \-\-- S \-\-- US Key

#### NATO has cyber capabilities, but coordinating with the US is key to a credible deterrent

Laura **Oolup**, 20**19**, \[MA candidate at the University of Tartu in
the Johan Skytte Institute of Political Studies, \"CYBER AS A DETERRENT:
UTILIZING OFFENSIVE CYBER CAPABILITIES IN NATO'S DETERRENCE POSTURE,\"
University of Tartu, https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/223009731.pdf\]

[The US has been widely acknowledged as the global cyber power which is
**at the forefront with** the **offensive cyber
capabilities**]{.underline}. Therefore, [**the US is extremely important
asset for NATO** to have credibility and capability imposing retaliatory
threat in cyberspace]{.underline}. [The US has not been clear in
words]{.underline} either [which capabilities]{.underline} exactly [it
possesses]{.underline}, [but the actions give a taste of
it]{.underline}. The [SCADA-attack against the Iranian nuclear
facility]{.underline} in Natanz [that caused kinetic effects is a
significant reflection of it]{.underline} (Zetter 2014). What can be
noted here is that the [offensive cyber capabilities have been presented
through their deployment]{.underline}.

Additionally, the existence of and participation in exercises like the
Crossed Swords organized primarily by the Cooperative Cyber Defence
Centre of Excellence accredited by NATO, enables Allies to improve their
offensive cyber capabilities and mirrors to the enemy which capabilities
are being obtained. During this year's exercise, the participants from
cyber commands and special operation forces tested their offensive
skills on attacking industrial control systems and also unmanned ground
vehicles (CCDCOE 2019).

So far, we can see that in general [NATO should have the potential for
utilizing offensive cyber capabilities as a deterrent]{.underline},
because [the necessary capability]{.underline} seems to exist. This [is
driven from Allies acquiring offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}
which have been also presented through previously conducted cyber
campaigns, certain [Allies have offered their sovereign cyber
capabilities for the use of NATO]{.underline}, the skills for creating
offensive cyber capabilities are being developed, [NATO is working
towards incorporating cyber component into force
structures]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, [when it comes to the
credibility of the cyber threat]{.underline} from the viewpoint of the
enemy, [there are some problems]{.underline}.

First two issues have already been touched upon above as well which
entail lack of knowledge regarding which kind of offensive cyber
capabilities are exactly possessed or being developed by the Allies and
secondly, ambiguous message by NATO's Secretary General about in which
cases and to what extent NATO would use the offered offensive cyber
capabilities. Considering the conceptualized classical deterrence
theory, the deterrer needs to be clear on its means, how they will be
used and which effects they could cause (see i.e. Knopf 2009:41).
Certain ambiguity could be acceptable in regards of the red lines, as
otherwise, the enemy can play too easily around the boundaries. But the
deterrent message should have more substance than just saying one is
acquiring capabilities to carry out counterattacks in case of a
necessity and that there have been few instances where those
capabilities have been utilized. This does not seem enough to influence
the decision-making equation of the enemy because it does not mirror
what could be the costs in case of the aggression. It may especially
turn out to be so if the adversary should happen to be risk-acceptant.

Third issue shadowing credibility of [the potential cyber threat is
stemmed from]{.underline} the previous two and this is that [different
'languages']{.underline} in the broader sense are [being used by the
member states offering their capabilities for NATO's use]{.underline}.
[This does undermine the credibility of the deterrent
threat]{.underline}, because in case of an Alliance, [common language
must be used by the members]{.underline} of it [to ensure that there is
no room for uncertainty and misperceptions]{.underline}. Talking about
offensive cyber capabilities as [a]{.underline} retaliatory measure,
[unified message by all the member states reflects the willingness to
retaliate and gives the enemy the impression that the Alliance together
stands by its words]{.underline}.

#### US coop is key -- it has the most advanced cyber capabilities within NATO -- examples prove.

Laura **Oolup**, 20**19**, \[MA candidate at the University of Tartu in
the Johan Skytte Institute of Political Studies, \"CYBER AS A DETERRENT:
UTILIZING OFFENSIVE CYBER CAPABILITIES IN NATO'S DETERRENCE POSTURE,\"
University of Tartu, https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/223009731.pdf\]

**[The US]{.underline}** has been considered the cyber power who "**[has
the most advanced cyber capabilities within NATO]{.underline}**" (Arts
2018:2). Therefore, it is not surprising that when the Defence Secretary
Mattis at the time pointed out during the announcement of the US
offering its cyber capabilities for the use of NATO is already willing
to do so today (Mattis 2018). [The US]{.underline} new [cyber strategy
allows military to carry out cyber operations to protect its
systems]{.underline}, [networks and national critical networks in
general]{.underline} (Nakashima 2018). Furthermore, [it seems that the
utilization of the offensive cyber capabilities is not considered
limited to deterring]{.underline} only [cyberattacks]{.underline} as it
is said, [the intention is also to]{.underline} "[ensure the US
military's ability to fight and win wars in]{.underline} any domain,
including [cyberspace]{.underline}" (Department of Defense 2018:1-2).

The offensive cyber capabilities the US is developing, have the purpose
to counter cyberattacks, but at the same time be considered as any other
means during war time. The offensive cyber capabilities should be
flexible. This means, the US should have in its use various offensive
cyber capabilities that can cause different types of effects depending
on the situation and necessity (Department of Defense 2018:3). They are
aimed to use as retaliatory measures in kind to cyberattacks but also as
means to enhance the US military advantage in any way. Therefore, in the
strategy it is mentioned that "[during wartime]{.underline}, [US cyber
forces will be prepared to operate alongside our air]{.underline},
[land]{.underline}, [sea]{.underline}, [and space forces to target
adversary weaknesses]{.underline}, [offset adversary
strengths]{.underline}, [and amplify the effectiveness of other elements
of the Joint Force]{.underline}" (Department of Defence 2018:1).

However, there is not that much information out there what exactly are
the capabilities the US obtains. Although, certain public announcements
give some ideas in this regard. For instance, it has been announced that
[the US is procuring a Unified Platform that should support]{.underline}
as a mission capability [the US cyber command in its]{.underline}
defensive and [offensive cyber operations]{.underline} (Pomerlau 2019;
Northrop Grumman 2018). Moreover, to develop the offensive cyber
capabilities and to in general improve the work and operability of the
US Cyber Command, it has allocated \$75 million -- which is 70% more
compared to previous year - in the fiscal year of 2019 to do that
(Pomerlau 2019).

[The US has]{.underline} examples of conducting [offensive cyber
operations that reflect]{.underline} both [the capabilities and
willingness to create logical and kinetic effect]{.underline}. [The most
recent example]{.underline} concerning logical effect is related to the
US cybercommand's actions in regards of the Russian Internet Research
Agency. [The US assault on Russian]{.underline} Internet Research Agency
([IRA]{.underline}) located in St. Petersburg [was a pre-emptive
approach to prevent Russia's troll factory to]{.underline} conduct
information operations and thereby [meddle with the US midterm elections
in 2018]{.underline}. The strike entailed cutting the IRA out of
internet. This was a notable operation, because it was the first kind of
the US to launch that kind of offense against Russia (Nakashima 2019).

[The Stuxnet case]{.underline} that has been brought up in this paper
for several times now [is the example of the US being able to conduct an
offense that relays kinetic effects]{.underline}. This was the
[US-Israel operation against Iran]{.underline} by [using the worm called
Stuxnet that was configured to target]{.underline} only [certain
computers targeting Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges to
halt]{.underline} the Iranian nuclear [bomb development]{.underline}
program. It was successful in the sense it caused physical destruction,
was first of its kind, and set the Iranian nuclear program behind by two
years (Zetter 2014).

Alliance]{.underline} therefore [provides **a forum for NATO entities

best practices; awareness raising; education, training, and exercises;
and innovation. 48. [Cyber security and defence cooperation

responsibility for cyberattacks**

When should states publicly attribute cyberattacks? [**Effective public
attribution** requires a **clear understanding** of the **attributed
cyber operation** and the **cyber-threat actor**, but also the broader
geopolitical environment, **allied positions and activities**, and the
legal context.]{.underline} The public attribution framework put forward
by Max Smeets and Florian Egloff in March 202127 distinguishes four
factors that act as enablers or constraints in public attribution. These
factors are **[intelligence]{.underline}**, incident severity,
geopolitical context, and post-attribution actions. The combination of
these four components [enables **consistent decision-making** about
whether to publicly disseminate information about an adversary's
actions, privately tell the adversary, or restrict knowledge of the
intrusion]{.underline} to the government and potentially other partners.

[**Collecting** and **processing
intelligence**]{.underline}---information about foreign countries and
their agents---[provides a **technical basis for
attribution**.]{.underline} How could [allies **improve intelligence
sharing** to conduct **more rapid attribution** and **enable a
response** to adversary cyber activity]{.underline}? During the
Nordic-Baltic foreign ministers meeting in Tallinn in September 2020, a
90-minute tabletop exercise was organized28 to test the ministers'
ability to respond to and attribute an escalating cyberattack. They
answered multiple-choice questions on communication of and possible
diplomatic countermeasures to the attack. The ministers learned through
first-hand experience that a [**timely exchange** of technical
intelligence **can be key** in attributing any cyberattack.]{.underline}
"[The **shared view**]{.underline} \[of the countries
involved\]---especially when it comes to complicated issues---**[is
crucial]{.underline}**," said Urmas Reinsalu, Foreign Minister of
Estonia.29

[Attribution is **only as good** as the information that allies are
**willing to share**. **NATO's value** can be in becoming the
**preferred platform** for **sharing cyber information**.]{.underline}
General Paul Nakasone, who heads US Cyber Command, told the House Armed
Services subcommittee on intelligence that "in 35 years" he has never
seen a better sharing of accurate, timely, and actionable intelligence
than what has transpired with Ukraine.30 [Sharing information and
intelligence **with allies** "**builds coalitions**" and can "shine a
light on **disinformation**" **campaigns**, like the one Russia used to
lay the groundwork for their **invasion of Ukraine.**]{.underline}

[The 2021-2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis is revealing of Russia's ultimate
strategy]{.underline} in two ways. Firstly, [it is now clear that a
cyberattack will more than likely precede a kinetic attack]{.underline},
**[especially when there is little resistance to that
aggression]{.underline}**. Secondly, [there will be more aggressive
action coming out of the Russian Federation and NATO and the U.S. are
not properly prepared]{.underline} on the cyber-defense front. The
evidence for the latter point has been **[addressed]{.underline}**
earlier with the examples of successful cyberattacks against the United
States such as the Colonial Pipeline and JBS infrastructure attacks as
well as the Notpetya attack.

[NATO has been primarily concerned with building up cybersecurity in
member states]{.underline}. **[The next step]{.underline}**, **[led by
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [**is to go on the
offensive** and accurately identify the sources of these cyber
aggressions]{.underline}. On several occasions, Russia has been able to
hide behind the idea that the cyber-attackers are not state-affiliated
and fiend responsibility of aggressions from within the Federation:

[Three successive U.S. administrations have failed to develop
any]{.underline} form of [doctrine to adequately address increasingly
problematic cyberattacks from unattributable sources]{.underline} that
plague U.S. businesses and can even endanger lives. Instead, the private
sector has been left to deal with ever more destructive and dangerous
ransomware attacks unassisted, and Russia continues to do nothing about
cyberattacks originating from Russian territory.29

[This is an epidemic that can be cured by shifting from a conservative
policy regarding the cyberworld and towards a **more proactive
position**]{.underline}. [If the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [were able to identify actors with
precision]{.underline}, further [measures could be taken to prevent
attacks]{.underline} on the U.S. infrastructure and on the private
sector. In addition, being able to identify these actors would allow the
United States and its allies to expose the perpetrators worldwide
through media with solid evidence, damaging the perpetrator state's
reputation with the international community. Once the United States can
present solid evidence against cyber criminals, [the United States and
NATO allies can voluntarily take conjoint actions against the
perpetrator state/entity]{.underline}. [This can be done through
**intelligence sharing**]{.underline}, public statements of support for
actions taken following an attack, and participation in the charges
taken against the perpetrator state/entity. [**This strategy is reliant
upo**n the ability of the United States and its allies to accurately
identify perpetrators with **a proactive joint campaign**]{.underline}.

**That's key to draw redlines and preserve cyber-deterrence**

Action Plan for the Next Five Years

[To make NATO **future-proof**, it must be **cyber-secure** and
**operational**]{.underline}. But is it doing enough to address the
complex and evolving challenges of cyberspace? [NATO's **strategic
challenge** is to blend its successful conventional deterrence functions
with a **new strategy** for **cyber action**. NATO's ability to send a
**collective message of resistance** and to establish a **credible
threat response** is its **most valuable asset**]{.underline} on the
cyber-security front.

Four sets of actions for NATO are proposed. First, denying covertness by
attribution: [NATO should persuade opponents that they **cannot be
clandestine** in their **cyber actions**. NATO and its members **need to
demonstrate** that it is difficult or **impossible** to act covertly and
**be clear about attributing responsibility** for
cyberattacks.]{.underline}

Until recently, governments did not publicly release details on cyber
incidents. But since 2018, [public disclosures of cyberattacks by
several Western powers indicate a **new multinational policy** of state
transparency. The **growing relevance of attribution** is partially due
to states becoming better at attributing cyber operations. Greater
public knowledge of cyberattacks **heightens awareness** of cyber
conflicts and leads to **greater public acceptance** of cyber
countermeasures.]{.underline}

Ultimately, [what matters is that states engaging in unlawful actions
using cyber means will **face consequences**]{.underline}. With
[attribution]{.underline}, policymakers show that they know what is
happening in these networks and can investigate incidents. It also
[clearly spells out **unacceptable behavior** and can help create
**state practice**. The best way to implement the international norms is
by **calling out behavior** and **having consequences** when these
**norms are breached**. **Attribution will make clear** to the malicious
actor that their actions will be **seen and addressed**. It is the
**basis**]{.underline}, under international law, [for
**countermeasures** and **self-defense.**]{.underline}

Center for Strategic and International Studies has shown the ubiquity of
cyber threats by publishing reports on major cyber incidents involving
espionage and attacks committed by state and non-state agents. Some of
the organizations and industries that have incurred significant cyber
intrusions and attacks include the U.S. Democratic National Committee
(2016), the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff (2015), the White House (2014,

66\. As argued, states most likely do not see a cyber attack as a viable
option for a pre-emptive, disarming first strike. However, [in a crisis
or pre-war situation, states could perceive **a significant "cost of
going second"**]{.underline} (Davis, 2014). In such situations, one side
"may well be frightened of what would happen if the other side attacks
and may be convinced that going first will be advantageous" (Davis,
2014). [**This could lead to high escalatory risks.**]{.underline} 67.
[In short and intense conflicts, **pressures** to use cyber attacks on
military targets **are high**]{.underline}, as they are just another
tool in the box, and the probability of attacks on critical
infrastructure is still low, since they would not degrade the defender's
capabilities quickly enough to make a crucial difference (Lewis, 2018).
If the war is expected to last longer, the latter type of attacks could
appear more tempting, however. 68. [Another key problem is the
difficulty of determining the intent of a cyber intrusion]{.underline}
(Lindsay, 2015). [When a defender detects a breach, he may not know
whether the intruder wants to spy on him, pursue active defence
measures, gain a foothold for future defensive measures, or prepare for
an imminent or future cyber attack (Slayton, 2017). It is extremely
**difficult to gauge intent** in cyber space]{.underline}, and, in such
cases, **[states tend to assume the worst]{.underline}** (Hennessey,
2017). [As a result, this can lead to **misperception and an escalatory
spiral** (Slayton, 2017).]{.underline}

attention]{.underline}** [on **Russian cyber aggression**]{.underline}.

"[We face a **determined**]{.underline}, **[aggressive
Russia]{.underline}**, **[seeking traditional political
advantage]{.underline}** [by new]{.underline}, [high-tech
means]{.underline}," Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the UK's National
Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said last month. Mr Martin added that
cyber threats from China, Iran and North Korea "have been a constant
over the past few years".

UK authorities last year exposed "a campaign by the GRU . . . of
indiscriminate and reckless cyber attacks targeting political
institutions, businesses, media and sport", affecting a large number of
countries, including Russia, according to the Foreign Office and the
NCSC.

Mike Beck, global head of threat analysis at cyber group Darktrace,
[says Russia's cyber policy has **switched**]{.underline}, from
information gathering [to **offensives** and **disrupting important
industries**]{.underline}.

"When the International Olympic Committee looked at evidence of Russian
doping, the Russian state response was to hack the World Anti-Doping
Agency and release information on other countries' athletes," says Mr
Beck.

To counter the heightened cyber threats, the UK's ministry of defence in
August announced the creation of a new army unit to focus on
"intelligence, counter-intelligence, information operations, electronic
warfare, cyber and unconventional warfare".

The EU said in June that it would conduct war-games to prepare for any
cyber attacks, signalling the bloc's determination to increase
co-operation against Russian and Chinese meddling. This would involve
finance and home affairs ministries simulating everything from fake news
to data theft to hacking into the operational technology of critical
national infrastructure.

NATO's Mr [Stoltenberg noted that a **serious cyber
incident**]{.underline} [from a **hostile state**]{.underline} [could
**prompt swift retaliatory action**]{.underline} [under]{.underline}
[the alliance's]{.underline} **[Article 5 collective defence
commitment]{.underline}**, where an attack against one ally is treated
as an attack against all members. The article has been invoked only
once, after the terrorist attacks on the US in 2001 which led to NATO
supporting the invasion of Afghanistan.

Other moves to counter aggression include the EU's cyber sanctions
regime --- signed off in May --- which issues penalties including travel
bans and asset freezes against individuals found to have been involved
in cyber incidents.

[Russia]{.underline}, however, [seems unperturbed by such
developments]{.underline} [and possible penalties]{.underline}, denying
involvement.

Russia's ministry of foreign affairs dismissed the UK's creation of a
new army cyber unit, noting that the threats were "imaginary" and said
the move demonstrated "the UK's anti-Russian policy".

Andrei Krutskikh, international cyber security adviser to Russian
president Vladimir Putin, in June told the UN's Open-ended Working Group
on Cyber Security: "[The greatest danger is that incidents online can
lead to a full-scale war offline]{.underline}. [The doctrine of
so-called **preventive cyber strikes** promoted by a number of
countries]{.underline} [poses a **real threat** to **international
peace**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}**."

[Short fuses on U.S. and Russian strategic forces have particularly

Cartwright, while "[**the sophistication of the cyberthreat \[to nuclear

"[One-half of their \[U.S. and Russian\] strategic arsenals are

"[At the brink of conflict, **nuclear command and warning networks**

The War Games-like scenario could unfold in one of the following three
ways:

First, [**sophisticated attackers from cyberspace could spoof U.S. or

//Weese\]

This month marks the fourth anniversary of Russia's March 2014
annexation of Crimea, an event that shocked the world and shook European
faith in the post-Cold War security order. In retrospect, it has become
clear that, for Putin, [annexing the peninsula was not so much an end
goal as a declaration of future intent]{.underline}, an [early
escalation in a broader and more ambitious effort]{.underline} that
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko recently termed, with little
obvious exaggeration, [Russia's "World Hybrid War" on Western democracy
itself]{.underline}. In an unusually bellicose speech on Thursday,
Russian President Vladimir Putin put Moscow's remilitarization and its
confrontation with the West at the heart of his pitch for re-election.
His approach to this confrontation, which many now term "[hybrid
warfare," mixes nuclear posturing and cutting-edge technology with
covert action]{.underline}, and was deliberately designed so as to make
it very difficult for the West to respond. President Vladimir Putin's
Russia did not, it must be said, invent hybrid warfare. Combatants have
always looked for innovative ways around the rules and conventions of
conflict, and Israel, Iran and the Gulf states have employed common
hybrid tactics -- including cyber attacks, and the use of armed proxy
groups -- for years. China's leaders, too, have found increasingly
unorthodox ways to push back against the United States and its allies in
their immediate neighborhood; it recently emerged that, while Western
nations were distracted by North Korea's nuclear program, China
artificially expanded islands in the South China Sea in support of its
territorial ambitions. What Moscow has successfully done, however, is to
refine a variety of old and new techniques to a higher level, and to
employ them in a wider range of ways. As with China and Iran, Russia's
aim in developing and perfecting its hybrid warfare capabilities is to
weaken and undermine the United States and its allies without sparking
all-out war. [It's a dynamic that brings with it some very real
dangers]{.underline}, **[not least of accidental
conflict]{.underline}**. The [American air strikes that killed dozens,
if not hundreds, of Russian mercenaries in Syria last month marked the
bloodiest confrontation between the two nations in decades]{.underline}.
U.S. prosecutor Robert Mueller's decision to charge 13 Russians and
several Russian companies with interfering in the 2016 election also
amounts to a significant escalation. Exactly what prompted Russia's
interest in reheating Cold War-era animosities remains a subject of much
debate among Western security analysts. Many, however, see its roots in
the anti-government protests that rocked Russia in 2011 and 2012, the
most serious such unrest since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Putin
was widely believed to be furious that American diplomats had wooed
pro-democracy and anticorruption activists, and to have concluded that
Washington hoped to subvert his power. When Russia invaded Crimea early
in 2014, and when a wider conflict erupted in Russian-speaking Ukrainian
regions later that year, it acted with ruthless efficiency. By using
troops wearing uniforms without insignia or identification -- who became
known universally as "little green men" -- Russia achieved surprise and
dominance on the ground before authorities in Kiev, let alone
Washington, really knew what was happening. It would be hard to
overstate how much this took U.S. President Barack Obama's
administration by surprise. The Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review,
published only days before the Crimea annexation, barely mentioned
Russia and prioritized the risk of war with China as well as ongoing
action against Islamist militant groups in the Middle East and beyond.
[Russia's seizure of the strategically important Crimean peninsula, and
its apparent role in shooting down a Malaysian Airlines
flight]{.underline} over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, [forced the
United States and its European allies to urgently reconsider their
beliefs about Russia's intentions]{.underline}. Since then, [NATO has
deployed battle groups to Eastern Europe and the Baltic
States]{.underline} (in case Moscow is tempted to try out the techniques
it used in Ukraine against NATO members). In some ways, this resembles
the Cold War, but it is in many respects a much more dynamic
confrontation. Russia is now far more closely intertwined with the West,
through investments and business deals, and this gives it new
vulnerabilities -- to sanctions, for example. Mueller's prosecution of
former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort -- who has a long history of
business interests to the former Soviet Union -- has drawn attention to
just how convoluted some of these dealings have become. Russian money
has been essential to the success of many Western businesses, possibly
including those of President Donald Trump. But many powerful Russians
are similarly beholden to the West -- which is one reason so many of
them have been frantically lobbying Congress to ensure their names
aren't included on upcoming sanctions lists. NATO members concerned
about Russian political interference have recruited armies of bloggers
and social media activists to push back against Russian messaging, and
established new monitoring bodies to track Russian disinformation
efforts. But, in hindsight, they may have interpreted that threat too
narrowly. Rather than simply concentrate its efforts on spreading
subversion on Europe's vulnerable periphery, [Moscow appears to have
concentrated on destabilizing the West's most powerful
countries]{.underline}. The most recent Mueller indictments allege that,
by mid-2014, Russia's preparations for its interference in the 2016 U.S.
presidential elections were well underway, and that it had already made
significant progress with plans to boost its political influence in
Europe. (These plans, the indictment suggests, included paying off the
so-called "Habsburg group" of well-connected former European
politicians.) Meanwhile, the ongoing fighting in Ukraine -- as well as
Russia's post-2015 military intervention in Syria -- has prompted a
major Western reappraisal of Russia's military capabilities. In addition
to its newer hybrid warfare tactics, [Russia has proved increasingly
adept at combining the use of drones, electronic warfare and more
conventional heavy artillery to lethal effect]{.underline} against
Ukrainian forces using more traditional Western equipment and tactics.
The seizure of Crimea prompted NATO to deploy a significant, and
permanent, ground force to the Baltic countries and Poland. [New fronts
continue to erupt, and Western analysts increasingly worry over Russian
activity]{.underline} in the Western Balkans. [Putin's explicit nuclear
threats]{.underline} this week [will likely **cause the United States
and its European allies to reconsider their own nuclear
postures**]{.underline}. It seems [far from impossible that the United
States would decide to increase its nuclear footprint]{.underline} in
Eastern Europe. Just over a century ago[**, a similar welter of
international anxiety** and confusion **formed** the base of dry tinder
that **World War One** would set alight]{.underline}. Russia and its
rivals must take great care not to allow history to repeat itself.

### 2AC \-\-- Hybrid War Impact

#### Russian [hybrid war]{.underline} escalates [globally]{.underline}

. The war is being fought simultaneously in a number of spheres, on
different levels, and in the never-ending, twenty-four-hour news cycle.
This aspect of warfare is particularly true of the field of information,
which is of prime importance in the Information Age that emerged with
the end of the Cold War. [From cyber conflicts]{.underline} and the use
of artificial intelligence [to]{.underline} the predominance of
[propaganda and **fake news**, the main battles of the Hybrid War are
taking place]{.underline} outside of the purely physical realm and in
the domain of new information technologies. Just as important to the
Hybrid War is economics, which has been the key driver of globalization
that paralleled the rise of these innovative information technologies.
The prominence of the U.S. media and the United States' immense
financial power give it a huge advantage in both fields. As a result,
[the **weapons of choice**]{.underline} in the Hybrid War are those that
use information and economic power to discredit and sanction one's
adversaries.3 Politically, the Hybrid War includes the outside
stimulation of political changes in other countries through street
activism and the promotion of specific values, parties, or popular
movements. [It has been characterized by interference in **elections**,
political transitions, and other political processes, including various
efforts to hack sensitive information, spread compromising or damaging
materials and fake news, encourage character assassinations, and impose
personal and other noneconomic sanctions]{.underline} (for example,
restrictions on travel, seizure of assets, imprisonment, or deportation)
[on opponents]{.underline}. [The existence of a **common info**rmation
**space** makes waging **political war**fare on foreign territory much
**easier** and more attractive than ever before]{.underline}.
Cross-border promotion of democracy and support for the color
revolutions that dominated the 2000s (for example, the 2003 Rose
Revolution in Georgia and the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine) have
now found counterparts in emerging solidarity among those who espouse
more conservative and traditionalist values, such as political systems
based on authoritarian models and strict national sovereignty.4 Military
power is not out of the picture---though its use is different than in
the Cold War. The static standoff of million-strong armies in Europe and
the long shadow of the nuclear arms race have drawn down or faded.
[Nuclear deterrence between Russia and the West remains in place but at
lower and more stable levels than during the Cold War. Today's **risks**
of **miscalc**ulation derive from potential incidents involving
**conventional forces**. A token military standoff has reemerged along
Russia's border with NATO countries]{.underline}, but, to date, this
standoff bears no resemblance in either scale or scope to the forces
that faced each other during the Cold War. [The main focus is on
developing new military **tech**nologies and novel means and ways of
prosecuting warfare---from outer space to cyberspace---that **blur** or
eliminate the distinction between **wart**ime **and peace**time. Like
its predecessor, the Hybrid War is a war in the time of
peace]{.underline}. Even more than in the past, however, the onus is on
national leaderships to minimize the number of casualties, ideally to
zero. Russian military strategists had developed the concept of hybrid
warfare even before the actual conflict broke out in earnest between the
United States and Russia in early 2014. Analyzing the experience of the
post-Soviet color revolutions and the 2011 Arab Spring, Chief of the
General Staff Valery Gerasimov wrote in February 2013 that the
"consequences of new conflicts are comparable to those of a real war";
in many cases, nonmilitary methods "are substantially more effective
than the power of arms," and greater emphasis is placed on "political,
economic, information, humanitarian, and other nonmilitary means" and
"covert military measures," including "information warfare and actions
by special forces." In this environment, "overt use of military force,
often in the form of peacekeeping or crisis management, takes place only
at a certain stage, mainly to achieve final success in a conflict." With
regard to the U.S.-Russia confrontation, another key feature has
surfaced: asymmetry between the sides' capabilities. POWER ASYMMETRIES
AND ASYMMETRIC ACTIONS Although Gerasimov was referring to a hybrid war
when discussing new means and methods of warfare, this analysis uses the
newly fashionable term to describe the current U.S.-Russia
confrontation. Unlike its Cold War predecessor, this conflict is
asymmetrical. At least since the 1970s, the Soviet Union was the United
States' equal in terms of both nuclear and conventional military power.
Even beyond its own vast land mass and immediate sphere of influence in
Eastern Europe, it wielded considerable ideological power in many
Western countries and in the Third World and presided over a system of
alliances [in **Africa**, **Asia**, **Europe**, **Latin America**, and
the **Mid**dle **East**]{.underline}. The Russian Federation, by
contrast, has few formal allies, no satellite states, and a handful of
protectorates, if one includes the self-proclaimed states of Abkhazia,
Donbass, South Ossetia, and Transnistria. It has no ideology to compare
with the comprehensive dogma of Marxism-Leninism, and although it is
still a nuclear superpower, it lags far behind the United States in
non-nuclear military capabilities. Economically, Russia---with its
estimated 1.5 percent of the global gross domestic product---is a dwarf.
Neither the balance nor the correlation of forces, however, will
determine [the **outcome**]{.underline} of this confrontation. Despite
the glaring asymmetries in the national power of the two sides of the
conflict, [the course of events is not predetermined. As a nonlinear,
highly asymmetrical conflict, the outcome likely will result from
**domestic developments** in Russia or the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [or both.]{.underline} Both countries are facing
serious problems that could prove decisive in the final calculations of
the Hybrid War. The United States is going through a triple crisis of
its political system, exemplified but not caused by the arrival of
President Donald Trump and the virulent domestic opposition to him and
his policies. [A crisis of social values lies beneath this **political
crisis** and points to a widening gap between the more liberal and the
largely conservative parts of the country. At the same time, the United
States faces a crisis within its own **foreign policy** as it struggles
to reconcile the conflict between the more inward-looking U.S. national
interest and the international liberal order of the U.S.-led global
system]{.underline}. Russia, though outwardly stable, is approaching its
own major crisis as the political regime created by Putin faces an
uncertain future after the eventual departure of its figurehead. Putin's
Kremlin is already working on a political transition that would
rejuvenate the elite and improve its competence and performance, but, at
the same time, Russian society is also changing and Putin's heirs cannot
take its support for granted. Gross inequality, sluggish economic
growth, low vertical mobility, and high-level corruption will present a
range of serious challenges to the future Russian leadership. The
eventual outcome of the Hybrid War could be reminiscent of the downfall
of the Soviet Union, which was far less the result of the U.S.-Soviet
Cold War than of a misguided effort to reform the Soviet Union itself.
Russia might break down and break up again, or it might decide on a
foreign policy more geared toward its economic needs than to a certain
concept of world order. As for the United States, it might decide to
limit its global commitments and redesign its international role as the
world's preeminent but no longer dominant state. Yet, in doing so, it
will need to accept that its change in status will come with a certain
price and that it will not be able to take advantage of the benefits of
the position it once enjoyed. Asymmetries in power lead to asymmetric
actions, which as Gerasimov suggested are intended to "neutralize the
enemy's superiority in warfare" or "identify and exploit the enemy's
vulnerabilities."5 By an order of magnitude---or
more---[Russia]{.underline} is outgunned, outmanned, and outspent by the
combined forces of the United States and its allies. To stay in the
fight, it [must rely on]{.underline} its few comparative advantages and
seek to use them to maximum effect. These advantages include the
geographical proximity of some of the main theaters of operation, such
as Crimea and eastern Ukraine, where Russia has **[escalation
dominance]{.underline}**; the Russian political system, which allows for
secretive, swift, and decisive action; and Moscow's willingness to take
much higher risks in view of the disproportionally higher stakes
involved for the Russian leadership and a national culture that
historically has tolerated higher losses in defense or protection of the
Motherland. Through swift decisions and actions, made without prior
warning, Russia is capable of surprising its adversaries and keeping
them off-balance. This situation [promises an]{.underline}
**[uncertain]{.underline}**, hard-to-predict, [**and risky
environment**, where]{.underline} **[miscalc]{.underline}**ulation [can
lead to incidents or **collisions** that, in turn, lead to]{.underline}
[**escalat**ion]{.underline}. Granted, these incidents would be of a
different kind than the tank standoff at Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie in
late October 1961 or the Cuban Missile Crisis barely a year later.
Escalation resulting from miscalculation would not be automatic, but the
wider damage it could cause needs to be taken seriously. AVOIDING
MISTAKES LEADING TO ESCALATION The Hybrid War is highly dynamic and, so
far, has no agreed-upon rules. In this sense, it resembles the Cold War
of the early 1950s rather than that of the 1970s. However, it is
possible, up to a point, to avoid military escalation during the Hybrid
War. U.S.-Russian antagonism does not mean that the two countries'
interests are in total opposition. Unlike in the second half of the
twentieth century, neither party envisions a real shooting war against
its adversary and neither wants to allow the situation to become
uncontrollable. The most obvious ways to manage the confrontation are
incident prevention, confidence building, and arms control. Incident
prevention, on the face of it, should be easy. Since the early 1970s,
Moscow and Washington have had agreements in place to avoid incidents,
which in the Cold War days carried the risk of escalation to nuclear
levels. Effective prevention requires a degree of professionalism,
adequate safety measures, and reliable channels of communications.
However, during a [**Hybrid War**, these]{.underline} preconditions
[cannot be taken for granted]{.underline}. Acting from a position of
relative weakness, Russia is likely to compensate for its inferior
overall strength by **[raising the stakes of
confrontation]{.underline}**.

[With our intelligence we have littered the planet with massive spent
nuclear fuel pools, emitting lethal radiation in over-crowded
conditions, with circulation requirements of electricity, water-supply,
and neutron absorbent chemicals. The failure of any of these conditions
for any calculable or incalculable reason, will release all of a pool's
**cesium into the atmosphere**, causing 188 square miles to be
contaminated]{.underline}, 28,000 cancer deaths and \$59 billion in
damage. As of 2003, 49,000 tons of SNF was stored at 131 sites with an
additional 2,000-2,400 metric tons produced annually. The NRC has issued
permits, and the nuclear industry has amassed unfathomable waste on the
premise that a deep geological storage facility would be available to
remediate the waste. The current chances for a deep geological storage
facility look grim. The NAS has required geologic stability for
1,000,000 years. It is impossible to calculate any certainty 1,000,000
years into the future. [Humanity could not even predict the mechanical
failures at Three Mile Island or Chernobyl, nor could it predict the
size of the tsunami that triggered three criticality events at Fukushima
Daiichi]{.underline}. These irremediable crises span just over 70 years
of human history.

How can the [continued production and maintenance of SNF in pools be
anything but a precedent to an **unprecedented human
cataclysm**]{.underline}? The Department of Energy's outreach website
explains nuclear fission for power production, providing a timeline of
the industry. The timeline ends, as does most of the world's reactor
construction projects in the 1990s, with the removal of the FCMs from
Three Mile Island. One would think the timeline would press into the
current decade, however the timeline terminates with the question, "How
can we minimize the risk? What do we do with the waste?" (The History of
Nuclear Energy 12). Nearly fifteen years into the future, these
questions are no closer to an answer. The [reactors at Fukushima Daiichi
are still emitting radioisotopes into the atmosphere, and their
condition is unstable]{.underline}. TEPCO has estimated it could take
forty years to recover all of the fuel material, and there are doubts as
to whether the decontamination effort can withstand that much time
(Schneider 72). A detailed analysis of Chernobyl has demonstrated that
[nuclear fall-out, whether from thermonuclear explosions, spent fuel
pool fires, or reactor core criticality events are deleterious to the
**food-chain**]{.underline}. [Cesium and strontium are taken into the
roots of **plants** and **food crops**, causing direct human and animal
contamination from ingestion, causing cancer, teratogenicity,
**mutagenesis** and **death**.]{.underline} [Vegetation suffers
mutagenesis, reproductive loss, and death. Radioactive fields and forest
floors **decimate invertebrate** and **rodent variability** and number
necessary to supply nature's food-chain and life cycles. The flesh and
bones of freshwater and oceanic biota contribute significantly to the
total radiation dose in the food-chain. Fresh water lakes, rivers and
streams become radioactive. Potable aquafers directly underlying SNFs
and FCMs are penetrated by downward migration of radioisotopes. Humans
must eat to live. Humans must have water. **No human can survive** 5 Sv
of exposure to ionizing radiation, many cannot survive exposure to 1
Sv.]{.underline}

Realizing the irremediable devastation caused by one thermonuclear
warhead, by one Chernobyl, by one Fukushima Daiichi, [it remains to be
said that the earth can handle as many simultaneous loss of coolant
failures as nature can create. **Humanity cannot**]{.underline}. [It is
not good enough to lead by relegating probable **human wide extinction**
phenomena to an appeal to lack of evidence.]{.underline} Policy cannot
indefinitely ignore responsibility by requiring further study. Nor can
leadership idle into cataclysm by relying on the largest known natural
phenomena of the last 200 years. Permitting construction and continued
operation of malefic machinery, based on 200 years of cataclysmic
experience is a protocol for calamity. Of coronal mass ejections,
Hapgood warns, that we need to prepare for a once-in-1000-year event,
not just simulate infrastructure safeties by the measure of what we have
seen in the past. The same is true for all natural phenomena. [The
future of humanity is **too precious** to operate with such
insouciance.]{.underline} The engineering is not good enough. It never
will be. Nature is too unpredictable, and nuclear power is too
dangerous.

Erica D. Borghard, "Operationalizing Defend Forward: How the Concept
Works to Change Adversary Behavior," Lawfare, March 2020,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/operationalizing-defend-forward-how-concept-works-change-adversary-behavior

Here, I want to focus on the first end state: the theory of victory for
how defend forward can change adversary behavior below the level of
armed attack. [Defend forward hypothesizes the U.S. can **change
adversary behavior**]{.underline} [through **making attacks less
effective**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, cumulatively, [by
**altering** the **adversary's decision calculus**]{.underline}
[regarding the perceived benefits]{.underline}, [costs and risks of
conducting malicious campaigns against the United States]{.underline}.

[There are **two specific pathways**]{.underline} [that link defend
forward with the desired outcome]{.underline}. [The first is driven
by]{.underline} a logic of **[cost imposition]{.underline}**.
Specifically, [adversary behavior will change when adversaries
experience]{.underline} ([or **perceive**]{.underline}) [an
**increase**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} direct and indirect
**[costs]{.underline}** [of conducting malicious
activities]{.underline}. [This includes U.S. efforts to **counter
adversaries' offensive cyber capabilities**]{.underline} and
infrastructure, the organizations that support their cyber operations
and campaigns, [and the locus of their decision-making]{.underline}. [In
addition to making it **more difficult**]{.underline} [for adversaries
to conduct malicious operations and campaigns]{.underline}, [this will
**force them**]{.underline} [to **divert resources**]{.underline} [from
other lines of effort]{.underline} [and **shift** to **secondary** and
**tertiary plans**]{.underline}, [and it will]{.underline} also
**[increase]{.underline}** [their **uncertainty**]{.underline} [about
the **likelihood of success**]{.underline}. [The second]{.underline}
pathway stems [from a **bargaining logic**]{.underline}---[to **reduce**
the **information asymmetries**]{.underline} [between the U.S. and its
adversaries]{.underline}. [The idea is to **improve
intelligence**]{.underline} about adversary capabilities, **[provide
early warning]{.underline}** of impending attacks, [and **enable rapid
counter-cyber responses**]{.underline} [and
**information-sharing**]{.underline} with targeted owners and operators,
[while]{.underline} simultaneously **[reducing]{.underline}** [their
**access**]{.underline} [to U.S. information]{.underline}.

**[Together]{.underline}**, **[increasing costs]{.underline}** [to
adversaries]{.underline} [and **improving**]{.underline} [U.S.
**situational awareness**]{.underline} [about **adversary
behavior**]{.underline} [and **capabilities**]{.underline} [can **reduce
information asymmetries**]{.underline} and help the U.S. get "left of
boom," [with the potential to **yield cascading positive
effects**]{.underline}. Additionally, [disrupting adversary
capabilities]{.underline} and infrastructure, in some instances, [may
have an **aggregate effect**]{.underline} [of disrupting
infrastructure]{.underline}, organization and capabilities [that could
have **supported multiple operations**]{.underline} by adversaries.
Moreover, [affecting the adversary's decision-making cycle can
**increase**]{.underline} [the **domestic costs**]{.underline} [for the
adversary's regime]{.underline} if defend forward creates costs for
stakeholders that support the government.

Defend forward has a number of detractors, some with important concerns.
The commission strove to address these, including by providing
recommendations for how the U.S. can improve engagement with
international allies and partners; detailing an enhanced signaling
strategy to mitigate potential risks of inadvertent escalation; and
proposing investments in resilience to shore up the private sector's
ability to withstand and rapidly recover from adverse events. However,
[if we agree that the **current status quo**]{.underline} [in cyberspace
**is not acceptable**]{.underline}, [this raises the
question]{.underline}: [What is a **viable alternative**]{.underline}
[to defend forward to change adversary behavior?]{.underline} Defend
forward seeks to create costs for adversary military organizations and
capabilities and improve U.S. situational awareness---as well as the
situational awareness of U.S. allies and partners---in support of
defensive strategic objectives. [Unlike in the realm of nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}, [in cyberspace **we cannot expect a binary
outcome**]{.underline}---the use of a capability versus nonuse, for
example---[but the U.S. **can** and]{.underline} **[should take
steps]{.underline}** [to **reduce** the **frequency**]{.underline} [and
**magnitude**]{.underline} [of malicious adversary
behavior]{.underline}.

[Today's fight in cyberspace occurs in the **gray zone**]{.underline}
[between war and peace]{.underline}. [If the United States hopes to
win]{.underline}, [it should spend less time]{.underline} [trying to
persuade its competitors that it is not worth hacking and **more time
preempting them**]{.underline} [and **degrading their
ability**]{.underline} [to do so]{.underline}. It is time to target
capabilities, not calculations.

HACK THE HACKER

How could the United States begin degrading its opponents' ability to
hack? Washington's actions need not always be aggressive or destructive.
In countries where technology companies are willing to cooperate with
the U.S. government (or with requests from their own government), a
phone call to the right cloud provider or Internet service provider
(ISP) could result in getting bad actors kicked off the Internet. This
is not a permanent solution, but it will force adversaries to rebuild,
which often prompts unforced errors, making them more vulnerable to U.S.
surveillance and disruption.

If subtle measures prove insufficient, [the United States should be
ready to **take more offensive action**]{.underline}. In situations
where the defense of the nation is on the line, [U.S. hackers could
pursue a campaign of erasing computers at scale]{.underline}, [disabling
accounts and credentials used by hackers to attack]{.underline}, [and
cutting off access to services]{.underline} [so it is harder to
compromise innocent systems to conduct their attacks]{.underline}. [Such
a campaign would aim]{.underline} [to **make every aspect**]{.underline}
[of hacking **much harder**]{.underline}: [because hackers often reuse
computers]{.underline}, [accounts]{.underline}, [and
infrastructure]{.underline}, [targeting these would **sabotage** their
**capabilities**]{.underline} [or render them]{.underline} otherwise
**[useless]{.underline}**.

[Such actions]{.underline} [need not send a message that hacking the
United States doesn't pay]{.underline}. Instead, [they]{.underline}
[should support a]{.underline} more limited but [more achievable
objective]{.underline}: **[stop adversaries from hacking the United
States]{.underline}**. [Whether or not foreign leaders
perceive]{.underline} [that cyberattacks]{.underline} on the United
States [are worth conducting]{.underline}, [Washington can **prevent
them from doing so in the first place**]{.underline}.

**[Offensive cyber-operations]{.underline}** [should not be undertaken
lightly]{.underline}---the United States must bear in mind its
commitments under international law and its relationships with its
allies. [But excessive caution cannot prevent Washington from defending
itself]{.underline}: [with the United States' enemies already attacking
it online]{.underline}, [the country will need to be **more
proactive**]{.underline} [than it has been thus far]{.underline}.

In addition to a declaratory policy, **[developing credible

[will be **key** to **bolstering credibility**]{.underline} of such a

States would respond to a cyber attack with anything but cyber
weapons]{.underline}. Peter Singer and Allan Friedman identified this
deterrence-in-kind as well as the prospect of mixed 'cyber- and
real-world retaliatory force' as one avenue to pursue to bolster the
deterrence of cyber attacks.13 [US Cyber Command's ambitious plan to
field over 100 cyber teams by late 2015 is a **positive step** in this
direction]{.underline}.14 [Evidence leaked in August 2013 that the

Offensive Weaponry is Required for Credibility and Deterrence

First, [if one wishes to be a **credible actor**]{.underline} both [in
the **military battlefield**]{.underline} [and in **world
politics**]{.underline}, [one **must have offensive
capabilities**]{.underline} -- as one must have defensive capabilities
and the ability to be resilient. [One]{.underline} simply [cannot have a
credible cyber defence without offensive abilities]{.underline}.

Second, [in order to **achieve**]{.underline} and raise her
**[deterrence]{.underline}**, [one **must possess offensive
capabilities**]{.underline}. [The ability to act
offensively]{.underline} [**includes** a **strong preventive message**
to]{.underline} the [others]{.underline} -- [provided that they
**understand it**]{.underline} [and **believe it**]{.underline}.
[Offensive capabilities represent the **key component**]{.underline} [of
**deterrence**]{.underline}.

Third, [offensive thinking and building offensive weaponry are **vital**
in order]{.underline} [to **create** a **strong** and]{.underline}
**[credible defence]{.underline}**. With just "defence thinking" one
will not succeed. One has to have an understanding of how the attacker
acts, and one should try to find all possible vulnerabilities in her own
defence. It is also a matter of developing one's defensive potentials,
testing the current defence and training one's forces. All this becomes
much more efficient if one can test it with her own capabilities.
[Without the ability to act as an attacker]{.underline}, [no country can
build an **effective** and]{.underline} **[credible cyber
defence]{.underline}**.

Fourth, agility and the concept of operations for smart defence are
reality in contemporary warfare for most countries. [One will never
achieve]{.underline} her [objectives by just being
defensive]{.underline} -- [regardless of how defensive her grand
doctrine is]{.underline}. [In some cases]{.underline}, [as it has been
in the past]{.underline}, [attack is the **best defence**]{.underline}.
One cannot stay in bunkers. Instead, [one has to be an **active
defender**]{.underline} [and **snatch** the]{.underline}
**[initiative]{.underline}** [when it is needed]{.underline}. **[Passive
defence alone will not work]{.underline}**. In short, when the lights go
off how does one defend with kinetic weaponry against a nonkinetic
adversary?

consciously and purposefully vague.2]{.underline}07 Why? **[Strategic
ambiguity has its benefits]{.underline}**. According to the Atlantic
Council panel, [there is no "redline" or "determined threshold" that
would automatically define a cyber act as an act of war.]{.underline}208
[Leaving the rules undefined affords NATO ample room in which to
operate.]{.underline} For a 28-member multinational organization that
operates on the principle of consensus, time and latitude for
solidifying strategic-level decisions are critical. [If NATO publicized
a cyber redline, **it would box the Alliance into a
corner**.]{.underline} [This kind of policy **could embolden cyber
offenders and provoke massive intrusions** that target NATO's networks
at just below this threshold.]{.underline} [Having a defined redline
could also invite nefarious cyber actors to cross it to test NATO's
resolve, damage its reputation as a leader in Euro-Atlantic security,
and undermine the credibility of its Article 5 commitments.]{.underline}
Following the Wales Summit in 2014, NATO affirmed its stance on law and
cyberspace while refusing to address cyber redlines: Our policy also
recognizes that international law, including international humanitarian
law and the UN Charter, applies in cyberspace. Cyber attacks can reach a
threshold that threatens national and Euro-Atlantic prosperity,
security, and stability. Their impact could be as harmful to modern
societies as a conventional attack. We affirm, therefore, that [cyber
defense is part of NATO's core task of collective defense. A decision as
to when a cyber attack would lead to the invocation of Article 5 would
be taken by the North Atlantic Council]{.underline} on a case-by-case
basis.209

newest states and that emergence of authoritarian regimes in the states
east of NATO's old perimeter would **lead to turmoil there or even
war,**]{.underline} a denouement that would ill serve US interests. The
proponents of NATO enlargement also considered it essential for
promoting economic reform and bringing militaries under civilian control
in countries that had been part of the Soviet bloc for decades (e.g., US
Information Agency 1996; Holbrooke 1995, 41--42; Talbott 1997; Albright
1997a). [They disagreed with critics who warned that NATO's eastward
expansion would eventually provoke resistance from a resurgent
Russia]{.underline} and force the USA to bear the burden involved in
protecting several militarily weak states near or adjacent to the
Russian border. Beyond that, advocates of reconfguring NATO after 1991
insisted that it should move out of area to help control confict,
consolidate stability, and advance human rights in countries outside
Europe. Included in this new agenda were humanitarian interventions (to
stop mass atrocities) and stability operations in countries emerging
from civil war.

merely to deter the Soviet threat but to bring postwar German military
forces into the alliance structure and calm French fears of a third
world war. [NATO was a crucial enabler of peace not only after World War
II but also after the Cold War because some Europeans feared that German
reunification in 1990 could create a new military juggernaut. **NATO's
military integration now means that even if right-wing nationalists were
to rule a European state, they could not threaten their neighbors**

#### Democracy solves global nuke war -- extinction

**Yulis 17** (Max, Penn Political Review, "In Defense of Liberal
Internationalism", 4/8,
pennpoliticalreview.org/2017/04/in-defense-of-liberal-internationalism/)

Over the past decade, international headlines have been bombarded with
stories about the unraveling of the post-Cold War world order, the
creation of revolutionary smart devices and military technologies, the
rise of militant jihadist organizations, and nuclear proliferation.
Indeed, **[times are paradoxically promising and
alarming]{.underline}**. [In relation to treating the world's ills,
fortunately, **there is a capable hegemon**-- one that has the ability
to **revive the world order** and traditionally hallmarked **human
rights, peace, and democracy**.]{.underline} **[The United
States]{.underline}**, [with all of its shortcomings]{.underline}, [had
crafted an international agenda that significantly impacted the
post-WWII landscape.]{.underline} **[Countries invested their ambitions
into security communities, international institutions, and international
law]{.underline}** in an effort **[to mitigate]{.underline}** the
**[chances of]{.underline}** a **[nuclear]{.underline}** catastrophe or
another World **[War]{.underline}**. The horrors and atrocities of the
two Great Wars had traumatized the global community, which spurred calls
for peace and the creation of a universalist agenda. T[oday, the world's
fickle and declining hegemon still has the **ability, but not the
will**, to uphold the world order that it had so carefully and eagerly
helped construct.]{.underline} Now, **[the stakes are too
high]{.underline}**, and **[there must be a mighty and willing global
leader to lead the effort of diffusing democratic ideals]{.underline}**
and reinforcing stability through both military and diplomatic means. To
do this, the United States must abandon its insurgent wave of
isolationism and protectionism, and come to grips with the newly
transnational nature of problems ranging from climate change to
international terrorism. First, the [increase in intra-state conflict
should warrant concern as many countries, namely in Africa and the
Middle East, are seeing the total **collapse of civil society and
government.** **These power vacuums are being filled with**]{.underline}
increasingly **[ideological and dangerous tribal and non-state
actors]{.underline}**, [such as **Boko Haram, ISIS, and
Al-Shabaab**]{.underline}. Other [bloody civil wars in Rwanda, Sudan,
and the Congo have contributed to the deaths of millions]{.underline} in
the past two decades. As [the West has seen, however, military
intervention has not been all that successful]{.underline} in building
and empowering democratic institutions in the Far East. **[A civil
crusade]{.underline}**, along [with the **strengthening of international
institutions, may** in fact be the answer to undoing tribal, religious,
and sectarian divisions, thereby mitigating the prospects of civil
conflict]{.underline}. During the Wilsonian era, missionaries did their
part to internationalize the concept of higher education, which has
contributed to the growth of universities in formerly underdeveloped
countries such as China and South Korea.\[1\] In addition, the teachings
of missionaries emphasized the universality of humanity and the oneness
of man, which was antithetical to the justifications for imperialism and
the rampant sectarianism that plagued much of the Middle East and
Africa.\[2\] [Seeing that an increase in the magnitude of human casualty
is becoming more of a reality due to advancements in military technology
and the increasing outbreaks of civil war, **international cooperation
and the diffusion of norms that highlight the importance of stable
governance, democracy, and human rights is the only recourse to address
the rise in sectarian divides and civil conflicts**. So long as the
trend of the West's desire to **look inward** continues]{.underline},
[it is likely]{.underline} that [nation states mired in conflict will
devolve into ethnic or tribal enclaves bent on **relying on war to
maintain their legitimacy** and power]{.underline}. Aside from growing
sectarianism and the increasing prevalence of failed states, [an even
more daunting threat come from **weapons that transcend the costs of
conventional warfare.**]{.underline} The problem of nuclear
proliferation has been around for decades, and on the eve of President
Trump's inauguration, it appeared that Obama's lofty goal of advocating
for nonproliferation would no longer be a priority of American foreign
policy.\[3\] In addition, [now that the American president is
threatening to undo much of the United States' extensive network of
alliances, formerly non-nuclear states may be forced to rearm
themselves]{.underline}. **[Disarmament is central to liberal
internationalism]{.underline}**, [as was apparent by the Washington
Naval Treaty advocated by Wilson, and by the modern CTBT
treaty]{.underline}. The reverse is, however, being seen in the modern
era, with cries coming from Japan and South Korea to remobilize and
begin their own nuclear weapon programs.\[4\] [A world with more nuclear
actors is a formula for chaos, especially if nuclear weapons become
mass-produced.]{.underline} [Non-state actors will increasingly eye
these nuclear sites as was the case near a Belgian nuclear]{.underline}
power [plant]{.underline} just over a year ago.\[5\] [If any government
commits a serious misstep, **access to nuclear weapons on the behalf of
terrorist and insurgent groups will become a reality,** especially if a
civil war occurs]{.underline}. States with nuclear weapons require
domestic stability and strong security, which is why [states such as
Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan could be in serious trouble in the
event of a domestic uprising or military coup]{.underline}. The
disarmament of all states is essential for human survival, and if it is
not achieved, then **[a world full of nuclear weapons and an
international system guided by realpolitik could give rise to nuclear
warfare.]{.underline}** In today's world, nuclear weapons leave all
states virtually defenseless. But, **[for nuclear deproliferation to
become a cornerstone of the global agenda, a pacifying and democratic
power must rise to the limelight to advocate the virtues of peace,
stability, and human rights]{.underline}**. [**Those who equivocate
democratic interventionism as an idealistic crusade cannot be further
from the truth.** Some]{.underline}, however, see [it as an effective
foreign policy that has a grand scheme for peace in
mind]{.underline}.\[6\] [The latter contention]{.underline}, despite
being widely disputed, **[holds the premise for the democratic peace
theory]{.underline}**. Throughout the history of all democracies, **[not
one modern-day democracy has fought against another
democracy]{.underline}**.\[7\] [Whether that's because of ideational
symmetry, similar objectives and morals, or generally pacific foreign
policies, **such a phenomenon must be given attention by
policymakers**]{.underline}**.** According to liberal internationalists,
**[democracies make better partners,]{.underline}** tend to **[move
towards increased political and moral agreement]{.underline}**,
[**oppose illiberal regimes**, and]{.underline} **[support disarmament
policies.]{.underline}** [This supposition is heavily supported by the
smooth post-WWII transitions that the German, Japanese, and Italian
governments underwent]{.underline}. [All of the governments were
formerly fascistic and authoritarian, but with intensive military and
economic support from the West, they became some of the most **shining
exemplars of democratic societies**.]{.underline} Even today, [Germany
is the backbone of the European Union and repeatedly champions
democratic norms]{.underline}, such as human rights, economic freedom,
and individual liberty.\[8\] Equipping other countries with the
necessary foundations for democracy is no easy feat, but **[the fight
for peace far outweighs the costs of inhabiting a world rife with
nuclear-armed authoritarian and belligerent states]{.underline}**. In
conclusion, liberal internationalism can have a lasting legacy on the
prospects for peace if it is executed properly. **[Putting democracy,
humanism, and liberty on a pedestal is what states ought to do if they
seek to save humanity from itself]{.underline}**. Although **[the rise
of transnational issues pertaining to climate change, nuclear weapons,
and civil wars should make international cooperation an increasingly
desired aim]{.underline}**, states seem to be thinking just the
opposite. Only time will tell whether this is a short-lived trend, or a
more ominous warning for the world at large.

the NATO Alliance." Harvard's Belfer Center. 9/5/2018.
https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/assessing-value-nato-alliance

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Menendez, you have asked for an assessment of
NATO's value to the United States. In my judgment, [NATO continues to be
of **vital importance**]{.underline} [to American security]{.underline}
interests in five principal ways. First, [NATO is at the
**core**]{.underline} [of one of the **most significant foreign policy
accomplishments**]{.underline} [in American history]{.underline}---[the
creation of a **long-term peace in Europe**]{.underline} following the
close of the Second World War. **[Because of NATO]{.underline}** and the
emergence of the European Union, [Europe is **united**]{.underline}
[after **centuries of division and war**]{.underline}. [NATO's military
strength has been a **major reason**]{.underline} [for the **absence of
war**]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the Soviet Union and
**[Russia]{.underline}** since 1949. A recent Atlantic Council study
reminds that America spent 14.1 percent of its GDP on defense during the
First World War, 37.5 percent during the Second World War and 13.2
percent during the Korean Conflict. We spend nothing close to those
levels now in large part due to the great power peace we have enjoyed
for over seventy years. NATO has been a major factor in that peace. And
due to the expansion of NATO and the European Union eastward after the
fall of the Soviet Union, millions of East Europeans now live in free,
democratic societies---a significant success for U.S. diplomacy. Second,
[NATO delivers]{.underline} additional [benefits to]{.underline} U.S.
[military objectives and operations]{.underline} beyond our shores.
[NATO is at the **heart of our defense**]{.underline} [of **North
America**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[Europe]{.underline}** [from
**nuclear and conventional threats**]{.underline}. British and French
nuclear weapons join ours in deterring aggression in the North Atlantic
area. Since the late 1940s, every Administration has believed that [the
**best way**]{.underline} [to defend our country is through American
forces forward deployed in Europe with the NATO allies]{.underline}.
[This strategy **remains right** for today given Russia's invasion of
Georgia]{.underline} in 2008, [of Crimea and Eastern
Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014 [and its current pressure on Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania and Poland]{.underline}. [NATO remains our **primary
vehicle for deterring Putin**]{.underline} in Eastern Europe. The [NATO
allies host a great number of **critical bases** for U.S.
forces]{.underline}---Ramstein in Germany, Aviano in Italy, Rota in
Spain, Souda Bay in Greece and Incirlik in Turkey---[that **serve as a
platform**]{.underline} [for our presence in Europe, as well as for
**U.S. force projection against terrorist groups**]{.underline} [in
**North Africa** and the **Mid**dle **East** and for]{.underline} our
[continued military operations in Afghanistan]{.underline}. [Europe is a
**critical link**]{.underline} [in the development of our **Ballistic
Missile Defense network**]{.underline} focused on the Middle East with
Turkey, Romania, Poland, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, the
UK and other allies all hosting elements of this system. [**NATO
allies**]{.underline} continue to [participate in the U.S.-led coalition
against the **Islamic State**]{.underline} in the Middle East. [Many of
the allies play **lead roles**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} other
**[counter terror operations]{.underline}** [such as French forces in
Mali]{.underline} supported by the U.S. In Afghanistan, the [NATO allies
remain with us in combat operations and in training the Afghan
military]{.underline}. Over 1000 soldiers from European and other
partner nations have died there during the last seventeen years. [NATO
continues to **maintain the hard-earned peace in Kosovo**]{.underline}
[with European troops bearing the large share of the
burden]{.underline}. An EU-led force has taken on all of the
peacekeeping responsibility in Bosnia, freeing up the U.S. for other
activities. Third, [the **NATO allies** are among our closest and most
supportive global partners as we confront the **great transnational
challenges**]{.underline} that define this century---[the **fight
against terrorism**, the entire complex of **cyber threats**, **climate
change**, the **risk of pandemics**, **mass migration**]{.underline}
[and **others**]{.underline}. The [**NATO** allies]{.underline} and our
partners in the European Union [act together]{.underline} with us on
these and other issues. [This is of **incalculable
benefit**]{.underline} [to the U.S]{.underline}. [Neither Russia nor
China have treaty allies]{.underline}. [NATO is a **significant
advantage**]{.underline} [for the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [when it **acts as a force multiplier for
American interests**]{.underline}.

If the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) did not exist today,
the United States would not seek to create it. In 1949, it made sense in
the face of a potential Soviet invasion to forge a bond in the North
Atlantic area among the United States, Canada, and the west European
states. Today, if the United States were starting from scratch in a
world of transnational threats, the [debate]{.underline} would be [over
whether to follow liberal and neoconservative calls for an alliance of
democracies]{.underline} without regard to geography or to develop a
great power concert envisioned by the realists to uphold the current
order. The United States is not, however, starting from scratch, and
[**NATO should not disappear.** While the bonds across the Atlantic may
be frayed]{.underline}, [they are stronger than those tying the United
States to other parts of the world. Common history and values
matter]{.underline}, as do the resources (both financial and military)
that Europe possesses. The [NATO allies share a common interest in

such as Islamic extremism and]{.underline} the **[rise of authoritarian
states]{.underline}**. For the United States, [the alliance is a source
of legitimacy for]{.underline} actions in places like Afghanistan. For
Europe, **[NATO is a vehicle for projecting hard power]{.underline}**.
While [NATO]{.underline} alone cannot defend against the range of
threats facing the member states, it [can serve as the hub for American
and European leaders to develop the ties with other institutions and
non-European countries]{.underline} necessary to provide for the common
defense. For all its faults, [NATO enables the United States to partner
with **close democratic allies**]{.underline} in ways that would be
[difficult without a formal institution]{.underline} that provides a
headquarters and ready venue for decision-making, as well as
**[legitimacy and support for action that ad hoc U.S.-led coalitions do
not.]{.underline}** As has been true since the fall of the Berlin Wall
two decades ago, the United States (and Europe) should want
**[NATO]{.underline}** to succeed. After the Cold War, the alliance
dramatically redefined itself. In the 1990s, it [fostered stability
across **Europe**]{.underline} by beginning its process of enlargement
to the formerly communist east and by intervening to stop genocide in
the Balkans. In the 2000s, [it broadened its scope through]{.underline}
the mission in Afghanistan as well as a **[counterterrorist
operation]{.underline}** in the Mediterranean and counterpiracy efforts
in the Gulf of Aden and off the Horn of Africa (in addition to
continuing the enlargement process). But as NATO has broadened its
scope, some members have grown concerned that the alliance is shifting
its attention away from Europe. These members seek to return NATO to a
more traditional understanding of its role defending against threats on
the continent, particularly as an increasingly authoritarian and
assertive Russian government has sought to reclaim a sphere of influence
lost in the Soviet collapse. In November 2010, NATO will release a new
"strategic concept" to guide the alliance going forward. That document
must state clearly that providing for collective defense in the
twenty-first century goes well beyond defending against the "armed
attack" of Article V. To remain relevant, [NATO]{.underline} must expand
its traditional understanding of collective defense to [confront the
twenty-first-century threats of **terrorism**, **proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction** (WMD) to both states and nonstate actors,
and **cyberwarfare.**]{.underline} By necessity, the United States has
turned its attention away from Europe in order to **[counter these
modern threats]{.underline}**, which largely emanate from Africa, the
broader Middle East, and Asia. **[If NATO fails]{.underline}** to accept
a growing global role, [then the United States will lose interest in
investing]{.underline} in the alliance's future. But Europe faces these
threats too and must recognize that a more [robust NATO
offers]{.underline} it **[the chance to counter them.]{.underline}**
Given the varied nature and source of threats today, NATO can be
successful only if the Europeans agree to stronger NATO-European Union
(EU) cooperation and to closer ties with major non-European democracies,
particularly those in the AsiaPacific region.

### 2AC \-\-- AT \-\-- NATO Ineffective

#### NATO is effective --- neg authors are overly critical.

**Skaluba 22** --- Christopher Skaluba, Director of the Scowcroft Center
for Strategy and Security, former Adjunct Professor at Syracuse
University, 2022 ("No consensus? No problem. Why NATO is still
effective," *Atlantic Council,* January 18^th^, Available Online at
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/no-consensus-no-problem-why-nato-is-still-effective/)

[Critics]{.underline} of the alliance (and even some supporters) have
interpreted NATO's unwillingness to militarily support
Ukraine---especially during the most significant challenge to the
European security order since the Cold War---as an indicator of its
declining relevance, timidity, or its divisions. But that
**[overstates]{.underline}** [the importance of political consensus to
NATO's value and **understates** its role as an **effective** and
**flexible** defensive alliance. This is a role with potentially
critical benefits for Ukraine.]{.underline}

[First, it sets **too high a bar** for an alliance of thirty members
with aligned, but distinct, priorities]{.underline}. [Unanimity on every
issue is **impossible**, let alone one as complex as military support to
Ukraine.]{.underline}. In reality, it's [Debate and disagreement, as it
should be for any democratic institution, are built-in **features** of
NATO---**not bugs**]{.underline} [astounding how often NATO does reach
consensus about issues big and small, creating an unrealistic
expectation that it always will]{.underline}. The opposite of consensus
is not failure. Suggesting otherwise turns any debate that doesn't end
harmoniously into an indictment of NATO, playing straight into Russian
propaganda.

Second, [a belief that NATO's value is tied primarily to achieving
consensus on every issue misses the more mundane (and important) ways it
supports its allies and partners. Its affinity for
process---particularly its ability to build a common situational
understanding among its members---is **an invaluable
tool**]{.underline}. [Habits of consultation and information sharing,
buttressed by deep cooperation on operations, intelligence sharing,
defense planning, and interoperability, create the foundation upon which
any consensus is to be built.]{.underline} [Even in the absence of that
agreement, the ability to collectively define threats and jointly train
to confront them is **immensely valuable** in its own
right.]{.underline}

Third, [these habits of cooperation give NATO members the flexibility to
**act outside** of the Alliance's frameworks]{.underline}. While NATO
does much by consensus---such as its missions in the Baltic
states---[the skills it helps members develop is central to **enabling
them** to form separate coalitions for action]{.underline}. This
happened recently with ample success in taking on the Islamic State.
Such flexibility should be a point in NATO's favor, not evidence of its
ineptitude.

In the case of military support for Ukraine, policymakers will find more
attractive alternatives for dealing with Moscow's aggression outside of
the auspices of the Alliance. Up to and including its recent dialogue
with Russia, it has taken a host of consensus actions to support
Ukraine---from condemning Kremlin aggression and standing up for Kyiv
politically to reaffirming its open-door policy with an expectation that
Ukraine will eventually become a member. [It might even share
intelligence and develop training and advisory programs for the
Ukrainian military.]{.underline}

[And while it won't find a consensus to fight, it could provide the
foundation for certain allies to support Ukrainian forces in ways
consistent with their national priorities outside of NATO]{.underline}.
In that case, NATO's enabling value to its members in complicating
Putin's cost-benefit assessment should be applauded.

[Last week's NATO-Russia Council meeting showcased an Alliance working
in lockstep and finding political consensus in responding to
preposterous Russian demands. NATO should always strive for this degree
of consensus. But if and when this crisis intensifies, and Putin
advances further into Ukraine, expectations for NATO assistance will be
raised, decisions about how to respond will become more difficult, and
consensus will be more elusive.]{.underline}

[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the **largest peacetime
alliance** in the world and has been arguably the **most successful**
such alliance in history.]{.underline}

[It has had **remarkable success** in achieving its basic goals:
containing Soviet expansion, checking the rise of nationalism and
helping integrate Europe.]{.underline}

[It provides a **model** for multinational cooperation, something we
desperately need in today's complex and dangerous world. and it has
shown an **admirable ability** to adapt to changing needs and
circumstances.]{.underline}

Three decades ago, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was
possible to think NATO had outlived its basic mandate. [But it found new
and important responsibilities in combating ethnic violence and civil
war, as in the former Yugoslavia, and countering terrorism.]{.underline}

[It maintains an array of peacekeeping and training activities in
**Europe**, the **Mediterranean**, the **Middle East** and
**Africa**.]{.underline}

Today, the crisis over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine presents
new challenges to the alliance [while reinforcing the fact that NATO is
**as relevant as ever**]{.underline}. [It is **essential** to the
security of our allies in Europe; and because their security is closely
tied to our own, it is essential to the United States.]{.underline}

In a sense, NATO rose from the ashes of World War II. Europe had been
devastated. An estimated 36.5 million Europeans had been killed, more
than half of them civilians.

Millions of people were displaced. America, throwing off its history of
isolationism, created the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe's economy. But
Western leaders worried about the region's military security. Would the
Soviet Union seek to extend its dominance into Western Europe? Would
nationalist militarism bubble up and lead Europe back toward war?

To address those threats, a dozen nations, including the United States,
signed the North Atlantic Treaty in April 1949. In the treaty's
best-known section, Article 5, the members declared that "an armed
attack against one of them ... shall be considered an armed attack
against all of them." It was a pledge for mutual self-defense.

Within months, the Soviet Union exploded an atomic bomb, putting an
exclamation point on the need for deterrence. The Korean War and the
Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 tested
NATO, but the alliance held.

It was a measure of the treaty's success that NATO forces were able to
avoid military actions throughout the Cold War.

[Over the decades, NATO expanded. Today it includes 30 member nations,
three of them former Soviet republics: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. It
also claims partner relationships with nearly 20 European countries.
NATO calls its partnership with Ukraine one of its "most substantial"
and says cooperation has increased since 2014, when Russia invaded
Ukraine and seized Crimea.]{.underline}

Ukraine has expressed interest in joining NATO. Russian leader Vladimir
Putin, who views Ukraine as part of "historical Russia," portrays that
prospect as an existential threat. With an estimated 100,000 troops
massed near the Ukrainian border, Russia is demanding a guarantee that
NATO won't let Ukraine join.

The threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine poses a real problem for
NATO. President Joe Biden said last week that "there are differences"
among alliance members about how forcefully to respond, depending on
what Russia does. Putin is likely to try to exploit those differences.
The best way to resolve this crisis, of course, is through tough,
clear-eyed diplomacy, with a clear message that Russia will face
consequences if it invades. But it's harder to negotiate from a position
of strength when all your allies may not be on the same page.

[NATO has achieved **remarkable success** in maintaining peace and
security throughout its **72-year history**. It has demonstrated,
probably better than any other organization, the importance of
multinational cooperation]{.underline}. But as the Ukraine crisis shows,
its challenges are far from over.

### 2AC \-\-- AT \-\-- Trust Turn

#### Unwillingness to [share]{.underline} new [cyber]{.underline} technology [undermines cohesion]{.underline}

**Bazin, 17** (Aaron Bazin, Lt. Col. PsyD, U.S. Army, 9-27-2017,

Five Factors That Could Fracture NATO\",

Organizational structures and processes. This project's focus groups
concluded that [NATO's rigid organizational processes that hold onto the
past could result in an Alliance "unable to evolve]{.underline} with
member states' national interests." Bureaucratic politics within the
Alliance structures could cause NATO's **[slow adaptation to
contemporary needs and values]{.underline}**. For instance, the
participants listed the top-down defense planning process of determining
capability requirements as a case where the Alliance and evolving
national interests do not align. Furthermore, civil-military frictions
on both NATO and national levels could negatively affect readiness of
the forces. Long decision-making processes and underdeveloped
institutional procedures in national headquarters could prevent the
Alliance from developing a legal framework for [a common course of
action under the NATO flag]{.underline}; for instance, [in addressing
new adversaries that use unconventional means such as
cyber]{.underline}. Put simply, **[NATO cannot be faster than the
individual countries]{.underline}** that make it up. Lastly, size
matters; cohesion is more difficult to forge and maintain in an
ever-enlarging alliance, especially when increasingly divergent national
interests tend to change the modus operandi of the Alliance. More rather
than less often, NATO's international staff will need to find compromise
during its decision-making processes between a political and formal
equality hoped to enhance Alliance cohesion on the one hand and the
desirable Alliance effectiveness on the other hand. Technology advances.
The participants agreed that **[technology advances are important for
NATO's continued cohesion]{.underline}**. Technology will constitute a
significant intervening factor in how NATO nations maintain their
cohesion in the future for three reasons. First, ever-evolving
communication technology can facilitate the spread of risks coming from
outside of the Alliance and exacerbate their negative effect. The
examples that resonated the most during focus group sessions are
information warfare and targeted propaganda against NATO nations.
Internet communications technology creates infinite room for alternative
media that distort reality, contribute to the emergence of populist and
radical movements, and increase the danger of miscommunication among
nations. Second, [NATO risks losing the innovation game]{.underline} to
the commercial defense industrial sector. In the future, private
companies will continue to stay ahead of NATO in designing
specifications and setting standards for platforms. This can have a
major impact on readiness and interoperability among NATO nations if
their innovation efforts (e.g., the U.S. Third Offset Strategy) do not
materialize.31 Third, some [nations may become reluctant to share their
latest technology acquisitions]{.underline}, especially if they put
private gains above the collective endeavor. **[This would pose a
challenge]{.underline}** "for anyone to share information they own
without gaining any profit for themselves." [The political unwillingness
may feed distrust, which can result in a deepening interoperability gap
between allies on the battlefield, and ultimately, a less cohesive
Alliance.]{.underline}

#### Network intrusions are the largest internal link \-\-- They destroy confidence in the alliance \-\-- Sustained cooperation and integration is essential

offensive cyber policy: A growing divide?\",
<https://hcss.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Essay-3-NATO-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-A-growing-divide-3.pdf)//Babcii>

Steady divergence [Yet when it comes to the direction of allies' cyber
policy, growing **differences are apparent** -- especially
in]{.underline} the development and deployment **[offensive cyber
capabilities]{.underline}**. First, even though most states now have --
or are in the process of -- establishing a cyber command, operational
capabilities vastly differ across states. Whereas some governments are
increasingly allocating significant resources to conduct cyber
operations -- and are now starting to benefit from these investments --
the majority of allies still run their cyber commands on a budget of a
few million a year --an amount that is insufficient for effective
operations in the cyber domain. Secondly, [until a few years ago, NATO
members' strategic visions were largely aligned]{.underline}. National
cyber strategies shared a common threat focus on operations that could
potentially cause major societal havoc, such as taking down the power
grid. Allies' national strategies were also largely unified in their
vision to address this threat, discussing the need for deterrence,
resilience, and norms. [However, this changed with the publication
of]{.underline} the US Department of Defense's strategy on [**Defend
Forward** and]{.underline} US Cyber Command's vision on **[Persistent
Engagement]{.underline}**.[\[8\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn8)
[The United States emphasizes the need to **cause friction** "wherever
the adversary maneuvers,"]{.underline} operating "globally, continuously
and seamlessly" (potentially) below the threshold of armed attack. "We
must...maneuver seamlessly across the interconnected battlespace,
globally, as close as possible to adversaries and their operations, and
continuously shape the battlespace to create operational advantage for
us while denying the same to our adversaries," in the words of NSA
director and Cyber Command head Gen. Paul
Nakasone.[\[9\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn9)
Whereas deterrence is about changing your adversary's cost-benefit
calculus, Persistent Engagement is about taking the opportunity away
from the adversary to
act.[\[10\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn10)
Third, [NATO member positions on how international law
applies]{.underline} -- particularly the obligations of states vis-a-vis
sovereignty -- **[are now more divergent than a decade
ago.]{.underline}** Whereas [countries]{.underline} like the Netherlands
and France are [located on the side of the "**sovereignty as a rule"
camp**]{.underline}, the United Kingdom has taken the position that a
remote cyber operation by one state into another's cyber systems or
network does not violate the latter's sovereignty. Where to go from
here? The [**divergence** in cyber policy across NATO member states **is
problematic**]{.underline}. Allies disagree on both the goals of cyber
policy and the ways and means to achieve them. [**This can cause tension
between allies**, especially when it comes to the necessity and
legitimacy of operating on each other's national systems and
networks.]{.underline} Some may argue that these differences result from
differences in maturity. Some states simply have not caught up with the
latest developments, goes the argument. This assumes a single path to
cyber maturity or that the dynamics of cyberspace pull all states in the
same direction. It suggests that -- even without major policy
coordination -- allies' cyber policies will converge over time. But a
more persuasive understanding of the current trend is that even though
states can learn from each other's institutional progress, differences
do not merely stem from states "lagging behind." **[These states are on
a different policy path]{.underline}**. This means it [requires
dedicated and sustained policy attention to,]{.underline} at a minimum,
**[coordinating the different policies of states]{.underline}** -- and
potentially bring them closer together.

[The United States must expand cooperation with its central and eastern
European partners not only to help bolster their defense capacity but
also to help the United States better understand hostile cyber actors'
activities and how to counter them.]{.underline} Central and eastern
European governments and societies are committed to improving regional
cybersecurity and have had to think creatively about becoming more
resilient. [The United States has partners across central and eastern
Europe eager to share]{.underline} [their frontline experience in
defending against hostile hacking and information attacks on their
cyberspace.]{.underline}

[That experience dealing directly with hostile cyber actors, combined
with U.S. resources and expertise, could vastly improve the security of
both the United States and Europe]{.underline}. "If you want to be more
secure, you need to do practical work with those who face a real threat
from the East," Kerza said. "If you sit at home thinking that a
cyberattack will never reach you, you'll be
wrong."[22](https://cepa.org/countering-russia-and-chinese-cyber-aggression/#footnote_21_6693) Meanwhile,
Iti Press, the counselor for cyber issues and economic affairs at the

experts have struggled to get access to their U.S. counterparts and

and we have learned our lessons. Use our smart people and
knowledge."[36](https://cepa.org/countering-russia-and-chinese-cyber-aggression/#footnote_35_6693) Joanna
Świątkowska, the former European Cybersecurity Forum official, said the
United States and Europe should expand the sharing of threat indicators
and early warning information to help harden European and American cyber
defenses and present a united front to hostile
actors.[3](https://cepa.org/countering-russia-and-chinese-cyber-aggression/#footnote_2_6693) And

**[American]{.underline}**-European [cooperation in cyberspace will be
vital to ensuring the security of the transatlantic
community]{.underline} in the face of shared threats from Russia and
China. It is highly unlikely that these foes will ever be deterred from
launching cyberattacks, [but by working together American and European
countries can be prepared to manage these attacks]{.underline} as they
come and exact a high price on those conducting them. In the coming
years, [the United States should focus on **engaging**]{.underline} more
with its European partners.

U.S. Cyber Command should conduct more bilateral and multilateral cyber
defense exercises across Europe, with a focus on engaging central and
eastern European states and expert communities. U.S. Cyber Command
should improve existing information-sharing frameworks with its
counterparts in central and eastern Europe. The U.S. government broadly
should bring eastern European cybersecurity and disinformation experts
to the United States, where they can engage with, learn from, and teach
their American counterparts. The U.S. government should also send U.S.
experts to work directly with their counterparts in Europe. The U.S.
government should coordinate strong joint responses with European
countries against particularly dangerous or reckless cyber actors such
as Russia. The U.S. policy community should engage with eastern European
officials and experts to learn about the effectiveness of various
methods of improving cyber resilience employed in central and eastern
Europe. The U.S. State Department and Congress should increase dialogue
with European governments and the European community to improve and
expand ways to name, shame, and sanction hostile cyber actors. The U.S.
government should increase financial assistance for central and eastern
European cyber defense and research programs through initiatives such as
the Countering Russian Influence Fund.

Virtual Domain," Global Security and Intelligence Studies, Spring,

Conclusions and Future Direction

[The growing number of OCOs being attributed to state or state-sponsored
actors demands a **better understanding** of the underlying factors that
result in the **militarization of cyberspace**]{.underline}. While the
existing literature posits two seemingly incompatible arguments centered
on either fear-based rhetoric or rational choice, the study has
demonstrated that both these factors account for the varying levels to
which cyberspace has been militarized across states.

On the one hand, [while **increasing societal use** of information
communication technologies have led to **greater risks** associated with
these technologies, the capabilities developed that are necessary to
mitigate such could similarly lead to the **transform** the domain of
cyberspace for use in warfare.]{.underline} [Aside from the re-tasking
of defense technologies, there is now the appearance of technologies
once associated with the criminal elements of cyberspace in OCOs
attributed to state or state-sponsored actors]{.underline}. The
malleability of this technology supports the argument that increasing
use alone does not account for the militarization of this domain, but
rather the ability to maximize the functionality provides those with
this skillset to expand beyond the traditional domains of air, land, and
sea.

[Equally important---and thus linking the two existent theories---is the
**continued relevance** of conventional military capabilities vis-à-vis
the use of cyberspace]{.underline}. While there is no doubt as to the
advantages offered by this virtual domain, namely its asymmetric
characteristics, low cost of entry, and challenges of attribution; these
exist in conjunction with the stated policy goals of a state. The
ability to employ this domain is dependent on conventional military
capabilities to consolidate whatever gains were obtained in the process.
[Although it would be theoretically possible to utilize OCOs to disrupt
a state's critical infrastructure in times of war, the impermanence of
the damage caused requires additional resources to be brought to bear in
order to force a change in policy or behavior of a given
adversary.]{.underline}

Viewed as the causal explanations for the militarization of cyberspace,
[the risk faced by a state may be understood as the **catalyst** that
encourages the **militarization** of this domain]{.underline}. However,
without conventional military capabilities that could be used to apply
constant pressure on one's adversaries, viewing OCOs as a revolution in
military affairs is of limited value.

With this in mind, what role do the other aspects (e.g., regime type,
rivalry, and elite influence) identified by the literature have on
militarization? Although the study has not demonstrated that these to
have a direct causal influence on militarization, this does not suggest
that no relationship exists. As previously mentioned, the nature of the
quantitative techniques applied could lead to differing results if the
number of observations is increased. [Regime type, for instance, could
influence the type of risk faced by states and, in turn, influence the
technologies developed to meet these risk.]{.underline} Hare's model
captures this and is seen clearly in cases of states such as that of the
United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC). [The former
perceives threats to its critical infrastructure and other services in
cyberspace. Consequently, this prompts the development of technologies
to ensure resilience and pro-active prevention of disruptive events. The
latter, in contrast, is concerned with dissent and political activism in
cyberspace. Consequently, this results in the emergence of censorship
technologies that do not translate directly to offensive capabilities in
cyberspace]{.underline}--- though espionage-related capabilities would
benefit from these (Giles and Hagestad 2013; Hare 2010).

Similarly, [perceived risk originating from internal threats could
account for the decision to engage (or not) in OCOs against other rival
states. However, cases such as that of the PRC do not follow this line
of reasoning as the most prominent of their activities in this domain
have been directed against their military, political, and economic
rivals.]{.underline}

Lastly, [the influence of elites in the militarization of this domain
could, in the view of authors such as Nissenbaum, **be constrained** by
a **lack of understanding** of its nature and the continued **lack of
synergy** between experts in technology and national policy]{.underline}
(Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009). This would lead to a situation wherein
political elites could, and do, vocalize the dangers posed by cyberspace
but lack the proper understanding of how to apply these technologies as
a tool to support national policies and goals.

The manner in which states conceptualize cyberspace at this point in
time finds parallels with that of the mid-twentieth century and the
advent of nuclear war. While the technology of the time offered to
revolutionize warfare, [few understood the implications of such and the
extent with which these would alter the relationship between states and
their respective military strategies.]{.underline}

[The increasing frequency of offensive cyberspace operations
(OCOs)]{.underline} directed toward states, particularly the disclosure
of Stuxnet in 2010 that appears to have been aimed at disrupting Iran's
nuclear development program, [has prompted a **reassessment of state
behavior** in cyberspace]{.underline}. [In the **years since**, states
have **gradually militarized** cyberspace through the establishments of
various programs that have framed this as a new domain of
warfare]{.underline}. Yet despite the pace of these transformations, [a
unified theoretical understanding of this phenomenon continues to remain
conspicuously absent. To date, scholars have attempted to explain such
by highlighting the advantages offered by cyberspace while others have
cited the growing fear-based rhetoric grounded by the increasing
societal dependence on technology. Neither of these, however, can
**adequately explain** why **certain states have militarized** while
**others have not** despite predictions of such taking
place.]{.underline} Consequently, this study, encompassing the period
from 2011 to 2014, proposes that depolarizing these respective arguments
may close the existing theoretical gap. In doing so, the study employs a
quantitative analytical approach that examines how cyberspace had been
militarized across states as a function of both strategic considerations
and resource requirements which are both driven by rational choice and
societal perceptions regarding this domain.

Russia and on long-standing concerns about defense spending and

Trump's criticisms of the alliance. [Over the past several years, both
chambers of Congress have passed legislation reaffirming U.S. support
for NATO]{.underline} (e.g., H.Res. 397, H.R. 676, H.R. 5515/P.L.
115-232, and H.Res. 256 in the 115th Congress; S. 1790/P.L. 116-92 and

to limit the President's ability to withdraw from NATO unilaterally
(H.R. 676 in the 115th; S. 1790/P.L. 116-92 in the 116th Congress). At
the same time, Congress continues to assess NATO's utility and value to
the United States, and some Members are concerned about key challenges
facing NATO, including burden-sharing, managing relations with Russia
and China, and divergent threat perceptions within the alliance.

16 Introduction The United States was the driving proponent of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) creation in 1949 and has been the
unrivaled leader of the alliance as it has evolved from a collective
defense organization of 12 members focused on deterring the Soviet Union
to a globally engaged security organization of 30 members (see Figure
1). Historically, [U.S. Administrations have viewed U.S. leadership of
NATO as a cornerstone of U.S. national security]{.underline} policy that
brings benefits ranging from peace and stability in Europe to the
political and military support of important allies, including many of
the world's most advanced militaries. During his term in office, former
President Donald Trump openly challenged long-standing U.S. support for
NATO, however, arguing, among other things, that NATO was a "bad deal"
for the United States.1 Although past U.S. presidents criticized
burden-sharing dynamics within NATO, none did so as stridently and
publicly as Trump. Trump's criticisms contributed to heightened
political tensions between the United States and Europe, prompting some
allies to question his Administration's commitment to NATO and to
criticize its perceived unilateral approach to foreign policy issues.
Trump Administration officials maintained that the United States
remained committed to NATO, highlighting the Administration's requests
in 2017 and 2018 to increase funding for the U.S. force presence in
Europe and its efforts to secure defense-spending increases across the
alliance in recent years. [Many allies have welcomed President Joe
Biden's pledge to renew U.S. support for NATO and to prioritize
consultation and cooperation with allies]{.underline}. NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg has said the currentne U.S. Administration
presents "a unique opportunity to open a new chapter in relations
between Europe and North America." 2 Allied heads of state and
government are to meet at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on
June 14, 2021, to set NATO's agenda for the coming year. Key allied
priorities include the following:

Throughout the 117th Congress, [there continues to be strong bipartisan,

initiatives]{.underline}. This has been all the more enhanced by the
Biden Administration's prioritization of this issue. Especially [in an
increasingly tense and partisan atmosphere]{.underline}, where
policymakers will continue to diverge from bipartisan agreements with an
election on the horizon, [cybersecurity issues will continue to be a
strong opportunity for lawmakers to facilitate]{.underline} real impact

the 117th Congress, cybersecurity policies and funding have garnered
attention in nearly every major funding package. This includes large
funding infusions within the 2021 American Rescue Plan, the 2021
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the FY 2022 omnibus package.
Beyond inclusion in these broader packages, there has also been
significant traction to move smaller, less controversial

aisle.]{.underline} Over the next few months when [very little policy

implications concerning jurisdiction of federal cybersecurity programs,

**The problem is [capability]{.underline} NOT [intent]{.underline} \-\--
The plans [integration]{.underline} of cyber strategy into NATO
[effectively]{.underline} solves Chinese [hybrid war]{.underline}**

Lauren **Speranza 20**, director for trans-Atlantic defense and security
at the Center for European Policy Analysis, 7/8/20, "China Is NATO's New
Problem,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/08/china-nato-hybrid-threats-europe-cyber/

[But **NATO**]{.underline}, long worried about Russia, [has largely been
silent on China]{.underline}. **[Now]{.underline}**, [that is
changing]{.underline}. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg recently
called on the alliance to stand up to Beijing's "bullying and coercion,"
underscoring how China's rise is fundamentally shifting the global
balance of power. It's apparent that [NATO can **no longer ignore the
threat**]{.underline}. [If the alliance hopes to **remain
competitive**]{.underline}, [it will need]{.underline} to develop [a
**new strategy** for dealing with Beijing]{.underline}. First, [NATO
needs a **common assessment of China's hybrid threats**]{.underline}---a
mix of diplomatic, economic, security, information, and technological
actions designed to quietly undermine democratic states and institutions
to Beijing's benefit while avoiding a traditional conflict. While
China's conventional military threat in the Indo-Pacific is far from
NATO's borders, its [hybrid activities are happening in the alliance's
own backyard]{.underline}. **[Cyber-espionage]{.underline}**,
**[i]{.underline}**ntellectual **[p]{.underline}**roperty
**[theft]{.underline}**, **[infiltration of critical
infrastructure]{.underline}**, **[debt manipulation]{.underline}**, [and
**disinformation**]{.underline} [are prime examples]{.underline}. [While
these threats may **seem** to fall outside of NATO's
purview]{.underline}, [they pose serious security risks for the
alliance]{.underline}. For instance, China's desire to invest in
Lithuania's Klaipeda Port may not look like a problem for NATO on its
surface. But its investments have worrying strings attached that give
China operating control over the infrastructure. That control could
decrease allies' willingness to move military forces---including
sensitive technologies---through the port and its surrounding networks.
This could lead to disrupted planning and fewer military exercises,
decreasing NATO's ability to defend the Baltic States during a crisis
with Russia. This could also open the door for pragmatic collaboration
between China and Russia to undermine trans-Atlantic security. [Allies
need to forge a **shared understanding of these risks through
information-sharing and dialogue**]{.underline}---[no]{.underline} small
feat for countries that do not see eye to eye on China. Some are even
willing to ignore such vulnerabilities, due to economic benefits or
disenchantment with trans-Atlantic institutions. [The
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has a **critical
role** to play in getting allies **on the same page** and **setting
common goals** for countering China's hybrid activities]{.underline}.
Second, NATO needs to focus on public diplomacy. **[NATO]{.underline}**
[has an important role to play in the battle against the CCP's global
narratives, which Beijing promulgates through **hybrid
activities**]{.underline}. [To defend]{.underline} the trans-Atlantic
values on which the alliance is built---freedom,
**[democracy]{.underline}**, **[rule of law]{.underline}**, [and **human
rights**]{.underline}---[NATO should clearly communicate China's
violations]{.underline} of these principles and its propaganda efforts
to cover them up. (These include, among others, human rights abuses
against ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang and violations of the U.N. Convention
on the Law of the Sea in the South China Sea.) NATO should also enhance
its outreach to key partners in the Indo-Pacific, such as Australia,
Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea, which can serve as important
counterweights to Chinese influence in the region. Effective public
messaging also means getting serious about attributing the blame for
attacks, as the European Commission recently did over Chinese
disinformation around COVID-19, to raise the pressure on Chinese
officials. Trans-Atlantic countries have struggled to shape China's
behavior because they cannot prove malign intent or agree to call out
Beijing for its subversive efforts. [Allies should develop **clearer
guidelines**---**what needs to be proved**, **by whom**, **and to what
degree**---to enable **collective attribution**. NATO is strongest when
it speaks with one voice.]{.underline} It should use that voice to
demand transparency and change from China. Third, the alliance should
step up its counteroffensive. China's hybrid actions intentionally blur
the lines between what is legally permissible, politically
inappropriate, and downright escalatory. This makes it difficult for
leaders to determine appropriate responses, producing a reactionary
approach thus far. But an intensifying geostrategic competition has
already begun. To compete in this environment, the trans-Atlantic
community needs a more proactive approach. Rather than waiting for China
to invest in the next major European port, allies should coordinate
legislation to prevent the riskiest Chinese acquisitions. And rather
than waiting for more Chinese cyberintrusions, allies should collaborate
on responsible, targeted offensive cyberactions. Over time, this would
help dissuade China from manipulating investments in critical
infrastructure, conducting cyber-espionage, and other hybrid activities.
While adopting a more offensive posture remains controversial among
certain allies, it is gaining traction across Europe and is strongly
supported in Washington. Although NATO, as a defensive alliance, should
not implement such a counteroffensive, policymakers should leverage it
as the primary forum to coordinate actions among willing nations.
Fourth, NATO needs to deepen its cooperation with other key players,
such as the European Union and the private sector. Where NATO lacks the
mandate and means, the EU and multinational businesses play critical
roles in developing, implementing, and enforcing the legislation and
financial incentives necessary to counter Chinese hybrid threats.
Complementary to that, [NATO]{.underline} and its allies [can focus on
providing intelligence, defending cyberspace, developing capability
targets for new technologies, conducting exercises and **contingency
planning**]{.underline}, [informing resilience requirements for secure
infrastructure, and **bolstering deterrence**]{.underline}. Despite the
political obstacles that impede more formal NATO-EU cooperation, allies
should look to the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid
Threats in Helsinki to bring together NATO and EU staff, national
officials, and industry voices in one place to align their
counter-hybrid policies for China. The Chinese government's manipulative
efforts around the coronavirus have thrust China's hybrid activities to
the center of trans-Atlantic debates. Policymakers need to seize the
moment and respond by "using NATO more politically," in Stoltenberg's
words. NATO is first and foremost about its nations. In the fight
against China's hybrid threats, these nations bring much more to the
table than military power alone. They have access to a broad range of
tools---military, political, economic, technological, and
information---which the alliance can use to its collective geopolitical
advantage in the competition with China. [What NATO needs now is a
strategy to leverage those tools in a coordinated manner. That will go a
long way in solving NATO's China problem.]{.underline}

#### Closer [integration]{.underline} with Europe is [key]{.underline} to prevent [EU-Chinese coop]{.underline} that allows them to [win the race]{.underline}

China also represents a long-term economic threat to Europe --- not
merely because it is an advancing competitor in a global market economy,
but because Beijing's policies are designed to use and abuse that open
world economy to eventually dominate it. [Beijing's leadership makes
**no secret** of its goal to]{.underline} foster high-tech industries
and national champions to [**overtake** its established Western
rivals]{.underline}, fueled by untold billions of state aid. By one
estimate, the Chinese government has lavished more than \$100 billion on
its electric vehicle sector, in the form of subsidies for buyers,
research and development support and other aid. Another \$49 billion has
been committed to create a Chinese competitor to Airbus. [**Partnerships
with European companies** are **vital to the success of China's
agenda**]{.underline}. [Beijing sees]{.underline} joint ventures and
other corporate [**cooperation** with foreign companies as a way to
**extract** the **advanced technology**]{.underline} [and **know-how**
required for China to **catch up to**, and then **leapfrog over**, **the
Western world.**]{.underline} An October report from the Foundation for
Defense of Democracies argues that [the Chinese are targeting **key
sectors**]{.underline} of the German economy --- including industrial
equipment and electronics --- **[with the aim of pillaging
them]{.underline}**. China's economic relations with Germany are "[a
**template** for the CCP strategy to **dominate the 21st-century
economy**]{.underline} and set the rules for the modern world," the
report contends. In other words, [by continuing to engage with China,
Germany is gaining today, but **paving the way to its doom
tomorrow**]{.underline}. There's little chance European politicians can
talk China into a better relationship. After seven years of
negotiations, the EU's recent investment agreement with China "amounts
to so little," lamented Brussels-based think tank Bruegel in a January
analysis. Littered with vague pledges and lacking methods of
enforcement, Bruegel noted that even on market access, the agreement's
primary focus, "only a few concessions have been made bilaterally and
all of them are limited." Simply hoping the Chinese will play fair is
naïve. While Beijing threatens and blusters that Europeans must keep
their markets open to 5G gear from Huawei, the Chinese are sidelining
European telecom firms in the China market. Ultimately, China is simply
not a true partner for Europe. The longer Europeans fail to grasp this,
the weaker their position will become. China will continue to exploit
the divisions between democracies to advance its interests. [European
politicians will **strain relations with the U.S.** by cynically reaping
economic benefits from China while Washington does **all the
fighting**]{.underline}. By the time Europe realizes it needs America's
help, it could discover Washington has found other, more reliable
friends. [Ultimately, the choice between the U.S. and China should be
determined by what Europeans want their role in the world to be. They
could **defend the liberal order** they helped create]{.underline} and
continue to participate in global leadership. **[Or]{.underline}** [they
could **sit back** and watch authoritarian China **knock away** the
**pillars of the current order**, and the sources of European influence
with them. Is the choice really that hard?]{.underline}

The [**West's** historic weakness in cyber defense **encourages
opportunism**]{.underline}. Russia began computer network espionage in
the 1980s, going after defense research and technology. [China began
cyber espionage]{.underline} in earnest in the early 2000s, when it
connected to high-speed global networks. China is omnivorous when it
comes to stealing intellectual property (IP) for commercial purposes.
[While U.S. cyber defenses are now stronger, **they are not strong
enough** to stop these advanced opponents]{.underline}. 

Russia has natural advantages. Its cyber efforts build on a decades-long
legacy of signals intelligence, espionage, and influence operations.
Russia's universities crank out skilled mathematicians and programmers.
Close ties between the Kremlin and the "Vory" (Russian criminal groups
that became powerful after the collapse of the Soviet Union) create a
culture where crime is deeply interwoven with government. This is
blended with (as we have seen in Ukraine) a powerful urge for revanchism
and a general disdain for Western democracies that the Biden
administration has only just begun to reverse. 

[China shares Russia's disdain for democracies]{.underline}. It started
out less capable than Russia, but the [Chinese government's massive and
continuous cyberespionage efforts have steadily improved its
capabilities]{.underline}. Before Xi Jinping took office, Chinese
companies routinely hacked each other as well as Western competitors and
the PLA freelanced for commercial gain, hacking to steal IP and resell
it to Chinese companies. China also has a strong hacker culture
connected to its growing technology sector. Xi has sought with
considerable success to bring hacking under Chinese Communist Party
control and focus it on his strategic goals. Private hackers were told
to cooperate or else, [People's Liberation Army hacking was refocused to
support national intelligence goals]{.underline}, and China's foreign
intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security, was allegedly given
a larger role in cyber espionage. **[There has been a marked uptick in
cyber espionage since Xi's arrival. ]{.underline}**

Political Policy and Institutional Arrangements

The fact that a given cyber threat or incident crosses the threshold of
political concern is without prejudice to its political and legal
characterisation for the purpose of developing an appropriate response.
Much will depend on political policy perceptions -- are cyber threats
and incidents predominantly perceived as human rights (i.e. data
privacy) issues, matters of law enforcement and/or homeland security300,
or matter of national security and defence -- and the different roles
played by the government agencies involved on the examination and
assessment of cyber threats and incidents, and competent to adopt or
contribute to actual responses. Accordingly, [it may be for multiple
reasons]{.underline} [that **NATO faces challenges**]{.underline} [in
**developing consensus** regarding]{.underline} [the **full
integration**]{.underline} [of **cyber**]{.underline} security and
[**defence** in its **respective mechanisms**]{.underline}, as well as
the necessary institutional arrangements.

First, [in an environment where any security]{.underline} [and defence
discourse is to a **great extent predetermined**]{.underline} [by the
**level of political concern**]{.underline}, [there may]{.underline}
simply [have been a **limited number of opportunities**]{.underline} [to
actually put cyber security]{.underline} and defence **[prominently on
NATO\'s agenda]{.underline}**. Second, quite similar to threats arising
from international terrorism, [threats]{.underline} arising
[in]{.underline} and out of the [cyber space may give rise to both
**internal**]{.underline}, or homeland, [and **external security
concerns**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} thus [trigger
the]{.underline} oftentimes **[complex delineations]{.underline}** [of
competence between the defence]{.underline}, [law
enforcement]{.underline}, [and intelligence sectors which]{.underline}
many NATO Nations [have developed into]{.underline} [strong checks and
balances amounting to a **separation of powers en
miniature**]{.underline} [within]{.underline} their [executive branches
of government]{.underline}. Whilst obviously [such **domestic
arrangements lack** the **capacity**]{.underline} [to **affect** the
**interpretation**]{.underline} [and **application**]{.underline} [of
the **North Atlantic Treaty**]{.underline}301, [they may
nevertheless]{.underline} **[de facto challenge]{.underline}** NATO
Nations\' Defence Ministries\' as well as Armed Forces\' [ability to put
cyber]{.underline} security and [defence on NATO\'s policy]{.underline},
[concept]{.underline}, [and **doctrine agendas**]{.underline}. [To
date]{.underline}, **[no well-entrenched method]{.underline}**,
[structure]{.underline} [or process]{.underline} [for
**overcoming**]{.underline} [this de facto challenge]{.underline} --
e.g. through involvement of foreign intelligence, homeland security
and/or law enforcement stakeholders -- [**exists** within
NATO]{.underline}. Third, [there is a **near complete
lack**]{.underline} [of **NATO-wide**]{.underline}, **[standardised
doctrine]{.underline}** [for cyber warfare]{.underline}. [The resulting
absence]{.underline}, amongst NATO Nations, [of a **militarily agreed**
and **legally cleared**]{.underline} (Article 36 of GP I) [understanding
concerning]{.underline} [the means and]{.underline}
[methods]{.underline} [of cyber warfare]{.underline} [may also
**contribute** to the **lack of political policy
consensus**]{.underline}. [The appetite for engaging in
hostilities]{.underline} which might be perceived as potentially
involving legally doubtful means and methods of warfare [may be
**limited**]{.underline}. [Ultimately]{.underline}, [the **absence of
consensus**]{.underline} [regarding **jus in bello**]{.underline} [may
thus have **repercussions**]{.underline} [on the **likelihood that
consensus can be reached**]{.underline} [concerning]{.underline} jus ad
bellum as well as **[collective]{.underline}** security and
**[defence]{.underline}**.

In addition, [the potential]{.underline} [for NATO to play a **bigger
role**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [defending the information
infrastructure by]{.underline} **[implementing]{.underline}** [a
**credible cyber deterrence strategy**]{.underline} [is **limited by
political disagreements**]{.underline} [on the
**conditions**]{.underline} [and **circumstances**]{.underline} [which
would **prompt**]{.underline} [any **collective response**]{.underline}
[to cyber attacks]{.underline}. NATO is currently focusing on
implementation of an active cyber defence strategy, with improved
security standards and requirements. While improved defence will to a
certain extent dissuade potential aggressors, this is of course not
enough for it to be considered as a real deterrent in its own right. For
actual cyber deterrence (by punishment), there is the prerequisite that
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty be considered applicable to cyber
attacks. In this respect the [NATO Policy]{.underline} on Cyber Defence
[reiterates that]{.underline} [any collective defence
response]{.underline} [is **subject to political
decisions**]{.underline} [of the **North Atlantic
Council**]{.underline}, [and that NATO will **remain
flexible**]{.underline} [on how it will respond to cyber
attacks]{.underline}. [This flexibility can be interpreted]{.underline}
in two ways: as a deliberate position calculated to keep potential
aggressors in a state of uncertainty regarding the consequences they
might face, or [as a **sign** that the Alliance]{.underline} [has
**difficulty** in **achieving consensus**]{.underline} [on a **firm
response option**]{.underline}. In the first case the aggressor might
indeed be dissuaded from attacking NATO's information networks by fear
of an unforeseeable retaliation. Unfortunately, however, [leaving
response options unspecified creates]{.underline} [a degree of
**ambiguity**]{.underline} [which might be perceived]{.underline} [as
**reflecting political disagreements**]{.underline} [among]{.underline}
the [Allies]{.underline} on when and how NATO should intervene. If this
were indeed the case, it might actually give an adversary good reason to
favour cyber attacks over other forms of action against the Alliance's
-- or the individual Allies'-- critical infrastructure. In other words,
the rationale for a cyber attack would be that
**[political]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[conceptual
divergences]{.underline}** [within NATO]{.underline} [might]{.underline}
**[delay]{.underline}** [the **consensus required**]{.underline} [to
**trigger** a]{.underline} **[collective response]{.underline}**. Here,
an interesting historical parallel is often drawn with the ambiguity
regarding NATO's nuclear deterrence in Europe during the Cold War: the
point made by some analysts is that the experience of nuclear deterrence
as practised by NATO and other actors can be usefully applied to the
cyber domain, insofar as nuclear deterrence doctrine prevented nuclear
conflicts. Unfortunately, nuclear and cyber deterrence differ
significantly in both technical and strategic terms. Attackers might
thus interpret the perpetuation of ambiguity in NATO's nuclear and cyber
retaliation posture as additional proof not only of political
disagreements, but even of strategic misunderstanding.

Such an interpretation must unfortunately be taken seriously. Cyber
attacks can take various forms, depending on their objectives and
techniques -- ranging from espionage, organized crime and disruption to
outright destruction. [Determining which category a specific type of
attack falls into will **largely depend**]{.underline} [on
**legal**]{.underline} [and **political considerations**]{.underline}
[at the **national level**]{.underline}.
**[Interpretations]{.underline}** might thus **[vary]{.underline}**
[from one country to another]{.underline}, [to the extent that a given
action might be considered an act of war by one member state but not by
another]{.underline}. [This **severely jeopardizes**]{.underline} [the
**political consensus required**]{.underline} [to **initiate collective
defence measures**]{.underline}. [The **resulting
difficulty**]{.underline} [in **defining** a **threshold**]{.underline}
[for **collective response**]{.underline} and an appropriate form of
retaliation [might in turn lead to a **considerable
weakening**]{.underline} [of NATO's **strategic credibility** in cyber
defence]{.underline}.

[**NATO was caught off guard** when the crisis started in
Ukraine]{.underline}. **[At the beginning]{.underline}**, [Russia's
**hybrid warfare** strategy]{.underline} of deception, ambiguity, and
denial [**complicated** attribution and response, and rendered **the
decision-making process** more difficult for NATO]{.underline}. The
Alliance did not manage to assess the environment correctly.27 As Major
General Gordon Davis, the United States general in charge of operations
and intelligence at NATO's military headquarters in Belgium during the
Ukrainian crisis, admitted, it took some time for the Alliance to
determine the "size and the scale" of the troop reinforcement, which was
continuously denied by the Russians.28

Russian President Putin masterfully played off the regional divisions
within NATO during his slow-rolling invasion of Eastern Ukraine.29 The
crisis shed some light on the fact that the sense of insecurity is not
the same in all NATO countries. Despite significant pressure from the
United States and NATO's worried Eastern European members, countries
enjoying good relations with Russia, notably France, Germany and Italy,
refrained from challenging Russia, and tried to mitigate the crisis via
diplomacy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated she was "convinced
that there is no military solution to this conflict, adding on the other
hand that no one could be sure they would manage to achieve a truce
through talks," such as those between Merkel, Hollande, and Putin.30

And so the Russian methodology outflanked NATO's reaction policies, with
the Alliance and its 28 members remaining bystanders, though there was
clear potential for the conflict to spread far beyond Ukraine. The
course of the conflict also proved paradoxical: Germany, for instance,
delivered military equipment to the Iraqi Kurds in the Middle East but
not to desperate Ukraine.31 France's focus on operations in Mali and the
Central African Republic during the Ukrainian crisis also highlighted
the superiority of national interests over the collective in the
Alliance.

[**However, subsequent** Russian **activities bolstered solidarity**
among the Alliance **and all members agreed upon** political and
military **measures** that broke the tangled relations between NATO and
Russia]{.underline}. [The **Wales Summit** became a **cornerstone of
solidarity and cohesion** for the Alliance, as the allies agreed upon
measures to counter the Russian threat]{.underline}. The RAP sought to
ensure a rapid and firm response to new security challenges. The [RAP
includes assurance measures, designed to reassure the Alliance's worried
members]{.underline} (especially in Eastern Europe) [of NATO's
solidarity and commitment against Russian aggression]{.underline}.
[These include **continuous**]{.underline} air, land, and maritime
[**presence and activities** in Eastern Europe]{.underline},
specifically in the Baltic countries and Poland, [on a rotational
basis]{.underline}. As a result, the Alliance increased its air-policing
activities over the Baltic States, enhanced naval patrols in the Baltic
Sea, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean, commenced AWACS (Airborne
Warning and Control System) surveillance flights over eastern Allies,
deployed ground troops to the eastern members for training and
exercises, and conducted three hundred NATO and national exercises in
2015 alone.

The [**RAP** also **has adaptation measures that envisage major
structural** and functional **changes in NATO's military
system**]{.underline}. [Specifically expected to enhance the Alliance's
capabilities is the reorganized NATO Response Force]{.underline} (NRF),
set up after the Prague summit in 2002 and [including the new Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force]{.underline} (VJTF) of around 5,000 troops,
some of are deployable within 48 hours. [The size of the enhanced NRF
has since tripled]{.underline} to around 30,000 troops, composed of
land, air, naval and special operations forces. The [**RAP insists on
responsiveness** and, above all, on the mutation of the NRF into a new,
revitalized model.]{.underline}

During the Warsaw Summit in 2016, [the Allies also decided to
**establish a forward presence** of multinational troops in the eastern
regions of the territory]{.underline}, in order to reassure worried
member countries, just as during the Cold War the Alliance's strategy
included demonstrating solidarity, cooperation, and cohesion. As the
Warsaw Summit declaration has it, Alliance members "have decided to
establish an enhanced forward presence in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and
Poland [**to unambiguously demonstrate**, as part of overall posture,
the Allies' solidarity, **determination**, and ability **to act** by
triggering an immediate Allied response to any aggression.]{.underline}

In addition to RAP, the [leaders also approved the **New Strategy on
Hybrid Warfare** during the Foreign Ministers' Meeting in December
2015]{.underline}. NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg described the new
strategy: to prepare, to deter, and to defend. [He stressed the Alliance
requires many different kinds of capabilities in order to defend its
population, since hybrid threats are themselves so diverse in nature,
and he **outlined the key elements**: increased responsiveness and
readiness of NATO forces, of intelligence, and of surveillance; improved
situational awareness; the use of special operations and of cyber
capabilities; and **close cooperation** with the European
Union.]{.underline}

[The framework]{.underline} of the New Strategy on Hybrid Warfare
[enhanced the Alliance's counter-hybrid-threat
capabilities]{.underline}. [**Improved situational awareness** through
enhanced intelligence and reconnaissance, and better **information
sharing** between allies]{.underline} as well as other international
organizations, [constitutes one of the main developments]{.underline}.
[The Alliance aimed to **quickly identify** low-level attacks or
indications of impen**ding hybrid warfare**, in order to **reduce**
ambiguity and **surprise**, as well as to **enable more precise**,
timely, and correct **decision-making**]{.underline}

The [**Special Operations Forces** are expected to **provide strategic**
and operational **support** for the Alliance's efforts]{.underline},
[most especially in effectively countering irregular warfare
elements]{.underline}, as they are more effective in this realm than
regular forces. For this reason, [the **integration** of special forces
into the NRF and VJTF **constitute another key measure** adopted in the
New Strategy]{.underline}. The first demonstration of this integration
took place during the Noble Jump exercise of June 2015, when NATO
deployed VJTF based on scenario that Poland was under threat of
irregular warfare. The deployment made clear in terms of potential
aggression against Alliance members, Russian irregular warfare is seen
as far more likely than conventional warfare.

Arguing that Russia resorted to massive and effective cyber assaults
against both Ukraine and NATO countries, [the **Alliance enhanced** its
**cyber warfare capabilities** as well]{.underline}. A February [2016
technical agreement launched a joint program]{.underline} with the
European Union, which initiated the exchange of information and incident
data, [in order to boost situational awareness of cyber
threats.]{.underline}35 The Alliance also began to study the legal
background of the relation between cyber assault and common defense. The
statement by NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg that "a major cyber
attack against the Alliance could trigger a collective response"36 has
made clear that cyberspace is likely to be an important operational
domain in future.

Additionally, [**NATO opted to counter hybrid threats by** pursuing **a
comprehensive approach across all** military, diplomatic, economic,
information, and social **levers available to the** international
**community**]{.underline}. [Cooperation and coordination with other
partner countries and international organizations]{.underline},
especially with the European Union and Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), [is recognized as key to countering hybrid
threats; in particular in this regard, the **critical civilian assets**
and civil issue capabilities **of the European Union.**]{.underline}

Both [during]{.underline} and after [the Cold War, Russia enjoyed an
advantage over NATO in speedy decision-making and deployment of
forces]{.underline}, as well as in the use of special forces. Ever since
the establishment of the NATO Alliance, authority to deploy troops, and
the use of these troops, has constituted a critical issue between member
nations and NATO officials. [During the June Defense Ministerial meeting
in 2015, **leaders** decided to **grant authority to SACEUR to prepare**
troops **immediately** when the Allies deem it necessary, thereby
**accelerating the** military **reaction process**]{.underline}. [As a
result, when SACEUR sees an unfolding crisis he is authorized to
mobilize NATO's new VJTF and send troops to the nearest flight line, to
await final orders for takeoff]{.underline}. Authority from the
Alliance's highest decision-making body---the North Atlantic
Council---must be granted before actually deploying the troops.37 In
this way, member countries retained final authority for use of the
troops.

[**The new measures** were adopted to **deter**, **dissuade**, and
**challenge Russian hybrid warfare**]{.underline} in addition to a
Russian conventional assault against the Alliance---the latter scenario
described by Putin himself as only a madman's fantasy.38 [**The Alliance
is militarily stronger**, **swifter**, and **more capable of responding
to any Russian hybrid threat**, particularly **against a member
country**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, political determination will
remain a key factor in challenging Russia.

Deterrence by denial (i.e., an ability to deny Russian objectives by
defensive measures) is only possible for NATO at the lower rungs of this
ladder, and NATO has not been idle here either. In fact, most of the
early [measures taken by NATO]{.underline} in response to the annexation
of Crimea [fall into the deterrence of denial category and centre on
rapid reaction capacities,]{.underline} especially in the shape of a
NATO Response Force (NRF) upgraded for deterrence purposes. [The NRF now
has a **reinforced**, quicker spearhead---a Very High Readiness Joint
Task Force potentially up to 13,000 troops strong, and then two
complementing brigades with support]{.underline} (each 13,000 strong)
[forming a layered, sizeable reaction force explicitly linked to
**collective defence** purposes]{.underline} and regularly exercised in
Eastern Europe and the Baltic states.35 [In 2016, in response to the
foreseeable difficulties of projecting mainly Western forces into zones
of conflicts close to Russia, NATO decided to established an "enhanced
forward presence"---]{.underline}four multinational battalion-sized
battle groups ---[in the Baltic states and Poland]{.underline}, and a
"tailored forward presence"---mainly naval forces---in the Black Sea
region. Whether these forces can credibly "deny" Russian objectives in
the case of limited war is a bone of contention. [Most observers and
sometimes NATO itself employ the descriptor "tripwire" to these
forces]{.underline}, thus [indicating that they are triggers that
promise to unleash NATO's big guns]{.underline} and therefore part and
parcel of deterrence by punishment. However, [US diplomats]{.underline}
(interviewed on background) feel more [confident]{.underline} that the
US battalion embedded (in Poland) in [the collective forward presence
posture would]{.underline} actually [be able to fight and survive, and
thus **deny Russian objectives**]{.underline}. That may be so, in which
case the conclusion is that NATO has a moderate-to-low---and
geographically focused---capacity for deterrence by denial and then a
more general and impressive capacity for deterrence by punishment.
[NATO's unquestionable capacity for deterrence by denial is rather found
at the **level of grey zone**, non-kinetic conflict]{.underline}. In
this regard, [NATO has **upgraded** not only its **cyber defences** and
enhanced intelligence coordination, as mentioned, but has **enhanced
coordination** with the European Union on hybrid threats]{.underline},
[with a 2016 joint declaration leading to a common work program and a
collaborative Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid
Threats]{.underline}, located in Helsinki, the 2016 adoption of societal
resilience benchmarks that, while mostly falling outside NATO's
political-military remit, nations must meet, and finally the decision in
2018 to [organize counter-hybrid support teams that can tailor
assistance to individual allies and circumstances]{.underline}.36 NATO's
full range of actions in response to Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea
---a range to which this brief overview can do only limited
justice---thus combines deterrence by denial (grey zone conflict,
societal resilience, reaction and forward deployed forces to counter
limited land grabs) and deterrence by punishment (the full chain of
reaction and deployable forces, from conventional to nuclear). [NATO's
strong suit is the military piece of this posture, but it has
considerably adapted to grey zone conflict scenarios in an effort to
achieve a **comprehensive deterrence** posture vis-à-vis Russia's
unified]{.underline} (kinetic and non-kinetic) [and
uninterrupted]{.underline} (all domains, in war and peace) [doctrine of
"new generation warfare".]{.underline}

[The most significant long-term challenge facing American and British
cyber agencies is not China or Russia --- it's a shortage of cyber
talent]{.underline}. [This workforce deficit isn't only affecting
intelligence agencies]{.underline}. One [recent
study](https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study/ISC2-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study-2019.ashx)
looked at 11 countries' cyber skill shortages and extrapolated that the
global deficit of qualified personnel sits at over four million unfilled
positions and argues that the workforce needs to grow by a staggering
145 percent. [Government agencies struggling to match the lucrative
private sector salaries on offer naturally find themselves on the back
foot]{.underline}. Cyber reserves, conscription models, and [the use of
volunteers](https://warontherocks.com/2018/01/estonias-approach-cyber-defense-feasible-united-states/)
are often touted as a panacea for boosting government recruits. Yet,
[[calls for a cyber
reserve](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1490.html) are not
enough]{.underline}. Cyber reserve models are often impractical and fail
to materially address nascent policy challenges. While cyber reserves
can certainly play a limited role in improving security, states such as
Britain and the United States should instead continue to focus on policy
initiatives that are better aligned with their political cultures and
operational requirements. Working with the private sector provides more
scalable reinforcements and enables a coordinated approach to protecting
what is often predominantly privately-owned infrastructure. Both
approaches can certainly co-exist, yet robust public-private
collaboration will often trump the whims of volunteers. Practical
Limitations of Cyber Reserves Calls for [expanded cyber
reserves](https://warontherocks.com/2019/09/the-presidents-own-as-a-model-for-the-marine-corps-cyber-auxiliary/)
underestimate the logistical challenges of implementation. [This has led
to [many policy
proposals](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/young-people-should-do-national-cyberservice-jshrhkf9l)
failing to address the nature of cyber operations or the lengthy
timelines often involved]{.underline}. As much as anything, [both
offensive operations and securing networks are a collection of practices
that require full-time staff and an organized approach]{.underline}.
[Most large government departments defend their networks 24 hours a
day]{.underline}. Security operations centers run around-the-clock
monitoring for potential threats. Likewise, [vulnerability management
programs, used to patch high-severity flaws, require constant vigilance
and active coordination in order to stay ahead of the
threat]{.underline}. Within these contexts, [full-time staff who have
experience working together develop continuity and established workflow
patterns to ensure threats aren't missed.]{.underline} Cyber espionage
campaigns are no different. It is assumed that operations conducted by
prominent state espionage groups, often [referred to as advanced
persistent threats](https://collierjam.com/apt-simplistic-as-123/), rely
on technical wizardry alone. Yet, [rather than their ability to exploit
flashy zero-day vulnerabilities or deploy highly bespoke malware, it is
often their operational capabilities that make the
difference]{.underline}. This was captured by National Security Agency
and former cyber security White House advisor Rob Joyce, who [stressed
that targeting large corporate networks requires plenty of patience and
focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDJb8WOJYdA&t=39s). This is
largely due to the [variety of
stages](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00396338.2016.1142093)
involved in cyber operations. This can include extensive open source
research on employees ahead of sending phishing emails, putting in the
hours to fully understand a target's infrastructure, or waiting for the
right moment to move laterally within a network. Crucially, successful
operations often come down to gritty abrasion[. Full-time staff, shift
patterns, and established routines are at the foundation of a successful
campaign. Supplementary staff waltzing in with the occasional weekend or
evening to spare might be able to contribute]{.underline}, yet these
operational realities limit their ability to substantially move the
needle.

Second, [Western offensive cyber operations might **spark war.** U.S.
cyber espionage and operations against Putin]{.underline}, his cronies,
or Russia's military forces [will appear far more ominous to Putin if he
believes they are aimed at regime change]{.underline}. Could Putin turn

cryptocurrency wallets of Russia's sanctions-avoiding kleptocrats? He
[might feel the need to escalate his own cyber operations]{.underline}
as part of his own version of defending forward. **[Escalation could
happen on the battlefield as well]{.underline}**. [According to the New
York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/us-ukraine-weapons.html),
teams from U.S. Cyber Command are "in place to interfere with Russia's
digital attacks and communications." Other teams are almost certainly
collecting digital intelligence on the location and intent of Russian
combat forces. [The United States is sharing such intelligence with the
Ukrainians but [apparently not yet providing any real-time
targeting](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/biden-administration-walks-fine-line-intelligence-sharing-ukraine-rcna18542).]{.underline}
That may change soon, as the United States seeks to alleviate
intensifying attacks on civilians. And with his KGB-bred paranoia,
[Putin might already see the presence of U.S. defensive and intelligence
teams operating on or against Russian military networks as evidence of
direct U.S. involvement in the war.]{.underline} Confirming his apparent
belief that Ukraine is just a NATO puppet, this might force a response,
either inside or outside of cyberspace. Further, [if Western
governments]{.underline} have [infiltrated Russia's operational military
networks, they may feel pressure to disrupt those networks]{.underline}
to prevent civilian massacres. Because cyber capabilities are billed as
non-lethal, reversible, and non-escalatory, tub-thumping newspapers may
push decision-makers to take shots they might not otherwise: "We can't
create a no-fly zone but [can use cyber capabilities to prevent civilian
harm](https://mobile.twitter.com/Jason_Healey/status/1498416936891387912)."
Some [well-meaning national
leaders](https://twitter.com/JacquiHeinrich/status/1500961829509636099)
may succumb to this pressure, **[potentially causing a larger
conflict.]{.underline}** Future Risks [Even if Russia and the West avoid
direct conflict this time, they might not be so lucky the
next]{.underline}. As relations worsen, future disruption of critical
Western infrastructure by Russian intelligence, such as the
[NotPetya](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/ransomware-hackers.html)
and [Olympic
Destroyer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/technology/winter-olympic-games-hack.html)
attacks, are less likely to be viewed as mere crimes. Repeated crises
bordering on war may further erode the tacit agreements and relative
restraint of quieter times. After repeated iterations of intensifying
cyber operations, both Russia and the West may feel their backs to the
wall with few options left other than military force when the next
crisis --- physical or cyber --- emerges. Under extreme conditions, some
of the same characteristics that lead cyber capabilities to be a
pressure release might have the opposite effect, a mechanism that Bob
Jervis and I have described as the [Escalation
Inversion](https://tnsr.org/2020/09/the-escalation-inversion-and-other-oddities-of-situational-cyber-stability/).
If Putin believes a direct conflict with NATO is likely and expects its
adversaries to [take measures to reduce
vulnerabilities](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/a-new-era-in-u-s-russian-strategic-stability),
he could conclude that the best possibility for success is to launch a
massive preemptive cyber attack. Since the U.S. military may seem
otherwise unbeatable, this [may
lead](https://www.brookings.edu/book/surprise-attack/) Russia to
"compensate with audacity in order to redress the balance." [The more
the United States **brags about its overwhelming offensive cyber
advantage**,]{.underline} but frets over weak defenses, [the more any
adversary might feel the need to [target the United States as early and
as hard as

Creating Unnecessary Vulnerabilities [Prioritizing offensive operations
can **increase adversaries' fears**, suspicions, and **readiness to take
offensive action**]{.underline}. Cyber [offenses include cyber
exploitation (intelligence gathering) and cyberattack]{.underline}
(disrupting, destroying, or subverting an adversary's computer systems).
An [adversary can easily mistake defensive cyber exploitation for
offensive operations because the distinction is a matter of intent, not
technical operation]{.underline}. [The difficulty of distinguishing
between offensive and defensive tactics makes mistrustful adversaries
**more reactive**, and repeatedly conducting offensive cyber operations
only **increases distrust**]{.underline}. A focus on [offensive
operations]{.underline} can also **[increase
vulnerabilities]{.underline}**; for example, secretly stockpiling
information about vulnerabilities in computers for later exploitation,
rather than publicizing and helping civil society to mitigate those
vulnerabilities, leaves critical infrastructure vulnerable to attack.
The skills and organizational capabilities for offense and defense are
very similar. Defense requires understanding how to compromise computer
systems; one of the best ways to protect computer systems is to engage
in penetration testing (i.e., controlled offensive operations on one's
own systems). [The similarity between offensive and defensive skills
makes it **unnecessary to conduct offensive operations** against
adversaries to maintain offensive capability.]{.underline} Thus, rather
than stockpiling technologies in the hope of gaining offensive
advantage, states should develop the skills and organizational
capabilities required to innovate and maintain information and
communications technologies. Managing Complexity The complexity of
information systems gives the offense certain advantages for purely
probabilistic reasons. [Imagine a race: offense and defense go hunting
for randomly distributed vulnerabilities, with the offense attempting to
exploit those vulnerabilities and the defense aiming to patch them. The
number of vulnerabilities grows with the **size and complexity** of the
computer system]{.underline}, as do the technological advantages of
offense---at least in principle. [With a vast number of vulnerabilities,
it is **unlikely** that the defense will be able to find and patch every
vulnerability before the offense finds and exploits it.]{.underline}
Technology is, however, embedded in social organizations, and
organizations can help the defense better manage complexity. Those that
develop software can check for common errors before making
hardware-software systems available for use. [The defender has complete
access to its computer system, whereas the attacker has a more limited
set of attack vectors.]{.underline} Organizations can help skilled
defenders by establishing good cybersecurity processes, such as
continually scanning for vulnerabilities and updating software.
Assessing Kinetic Effects To date, failures of cyber defense have
largely been failures of management, and the successes of offense are a
result of its relatively simpler goals. [Offense, like defense, becomes
more difficult as its goals become more complex.]{.underline} In
particular, the advantages that complexity offers the offense in
cyberspace diminish in the physical world. [Computers controlling
physical machinery can be hacked, but achieving particular physical
effects, such as covertly sabotaging nuclear enrichment facilities,
requires knowledge of the physical processes that the computers control,
not merely knowledge of the computers. Much of the detailed knowledge
needed to run an industrial control system is tacit]{.underline}, passed
from one engineer to another but never written down, let alone stored on
a computer. [Gathering such information requires traditional espionage
by humans on the ground, which is both expensive and risky]{.underline}.
A cost-benefit analysis of Stuxnet for both the offense and the defense
demonstrates why [damaging physical infrastructure is **more costly**
than simply infiltrating information networks. The costs of Stuxnet were
likely far greater for the offense (the United States and Israel) than
for the defense (Iran), and Stuxnet was relatively ineffective, setting
back Iran's nuclear program by fewer than three months]{.underline}. The
great expense of Stuxnet was intelligence; though digital espionage can
be used to obtain some kinds of information, the knowledge needed to
disrupt a physical control system, such as the detailed methods and
settings used to control pressure in Iran's nuclear centrifuges, is not
generally held in computers. The costs for both sides are dominated not
by technology but by skilled labor---for example, hackers who identify
and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, systems administrators who manage
and defend computer systems, and the nuclear engineers who understand
enrichment processes and the means of disrupting them. In addition,
assessing costs alone is misguided: [the perceived benefits of attacking
with and defending from Stuxnet (i.e., the value of Iran's nuclear
weapons program) greatly exceeded the costs for both the offense and the
defense]{.underline}. This is one reason not to be complacent about the
need to secure industrial control systems and critical infrastructure:
[though cyberattacks on such systems will be costly, a determined
adversary may be **willing to pay the cost** to achieve its
aims]{.underline}. Conclusion The common assumption that the offense
dominates cyberspace is dangerous and deeply misguided. The
offense-defense balance can be assessed only for specific operations,
not for all of cyberspace, as it is shaped by the capabilities of
adversaries and the complexity of their goals in any conflict. When it
comes to exerting precise physical effects, [cyberspace **does not offer
overwhelming advantages** to the offense]{.underline}. Because the
capabilities of offense and defense are similar, [improving defensive
operations allows preparation for cyber offense without **risking
geopolitical instability** or increasing vulnerability to
attack.]{.underline}

**An offensive cyber posture [fails]{.underline} and [causes
escalation]{.underline}.**

The Myth of the Offense

Contrary to observed patterns of limited disruption and espionage, Cyber
Command sees cyberspace as a domain fraught with increasing risk, where
great powers such as China and Russia will undermine American power. The
only solution, from this perspective, is to go on the offense. Yet, [the
benefits of an offensive posture]{.underline}, especially [in
cyberspace]{.underline}, [are]{.underline} mostly
**[illusory]{.underline}** to date. Instead, [the cyber domain tends to
be optimized for defense and deception]{.underline}, not decisive
offensive blows. [Not only is offense likely the weaker form of
competition in cyberspace]{.underline}, [it also **risks inadvertent
escalation**]{.underline}. [The fear]{.underline},
[suspicion]{.underline}, [and misperception that characterize interstate
rivalries **exacerbate** the **risk** of offensive action in
cyberspace]{.underline}.

[Cyber Command's 2018 persistent-action strategy aims to]{.underline}
"[expose adversaries' weaknesses]{.underline}, [learn their intentions
and capabilities]{.underline}, [and counter attacks close to their
origins]{.underline}."44 Put in simple terms, the best defense is a good
offense: get on adversary networks and stop cyber operations targeting
the United States before they occur. [Under this strategy]{.underline},
[offensive cyber operations will also be **preemptive**]{.underline} in
that they are designed to "contest dangerous adversary activity before
it impairs \[U.S.\] national power."45 To use another sports metaphor,
come out swinging. Go on the offense first and establish escalation
dominance (that is, demonstrating such superior capabilities over the
target state that it can't afford to escalate in response).46

According to Cyber Command, preemptive strikes will "impose . . .
strategic costs on our adversaries, compelling them to shift resources
to defense and reduce attacks."47 Whether through punishment, risk, or
denial strategies, offensive actions theoretically alter the target's
behavior by increasing the expected costs of targeting U.S. interests.48
Offensive action, according to this thinking, deters future aggression
by signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance. Yet, [there
are well-established reasons to doubt that offensive options produce the
intended results in cyberspace]{.underline}.

Defense and Deception

[The rationale behind persistent action]{.underline}---[that the best
defense is a good offense]{.underline}---[is **deeply
flawed**]{.underline}. In fact, [most military and strategic theory
holds that the defense is the **superior posture**]{.underline}.49 For
example, Sun Tzu describes controlling an adversary to make their
actions more predictable, and hence easy to undermine, by baiting them
to attack strong points.50 [The stronger form of war is a
deception-driven defense]{.underline}: [confusing an attacker so that
they waste resources attacking strong points that appear
weak]{.underline}. This parallels cybersecurity scholars Erik Gartzke
and Jon Lindsay's claim that [cyberspace is **not offense
dominant**]{.underline}, [but **deception dominant**]{.underline}.51
Rather than persistent action and preemptive strikes on adversary
networks, [the United States needs **persistent deception**]{.underline}
[and **defensive counterstrikes**]{.underline} [optimized to **undermine
adversary planning**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[capabilities]{.underline}**.

Fear and the Security Dilemma

[New policy options proposed by Cyber Command]{.underline} and the Trump
administration **[risk exacerbating fear]{.underline}** in other
countries [and creating a **self-reinforcing spiral**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[tit-for-tat escalations]{.underline}** [that ri**sk
war** even though each actor feels]{.underline} [he is acting
defensively]{.underline}---or, as it is called in the scholarly
literature, a security dilemma.52 As shown above, most cyber operations
to date have not resulted in escalation. The cyber domain has been a
world of spies collecting valuable information and engaging in limited
disruptions that substitute for, as well as complement, more
conventional options. [Shifting to a policy of **preemptive offensive
cyber warfare** risks **provoking fear**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[overreaction]{.underline}** [in other states and possibly **producing
conflict spirals**]{.underline}. [Even]{.underline} limited-objective
cyber offensive action defined as "[defending forward]{.underline}" [can
be misinterpreted and lead to inadvertent escalation]{.underline}.53 As
the historian Cathal Nolan puts it, "intrusions into a state's
strategically important networks pose serious risks and are therefore
inherently threatening."54

More worryingly, [with a more offensive posture]{.underline}, [it will
be **increasingly difficult** for states]{.underline} [to differentiate
between cyber espionage and more damaging degradation
operations]{.underline}.55 What the United States calls defending
forward, China and Russia will call preemptive strikes. Worse still,
[this posture will likely lead great powers to assume all network
intrusions]{.underline}, including espionage, [are preparing the
environment for follow-on offensive strikes]{.underline}. According to
cybersecurity scholar Ben Buchanan, "in the \[aggressor\] state's own
view, such moves are clearly defensive, merely ensuring that its
military will have the strength and flexibility to meet whatever comes
its way. Yet potential adversaries are unlikely to share this
perspective."56 [The new strategy risks producing a]{.underline}
"**[forever cyber war]{.underline}**" [prone to **inadvertent
escalation**]{.underline} [because it implies all cyber operations
should be interpreted as escalatory by adversaries]{.underline}.57

The Myth of Decisive Cyber Victory

[There is a tendency in the military profession]{.underline}, at least
in the United States and Europe, [to uphold the concept of decisive
battle as central to the Western way of war]{.underline}.58 Often,
[disruptive technologies]{.underline}---from strategic bombers in the
mid-20th century to cyber operations in the 21st century---[are seen as
providing decisive offensive advantages in crises]{.underline}. In the
interwar period between the world wars, airpower enthusiasts argued that
bombers would reliably reach their targets, forcing political leaders to
end hostilities or face the prospect of destroyed cities and economic
collapse.59

[Yet the search for decisive battle is]{.underline} [often an
**elusive**]{.underline}, [if not **dangerous**]{.underline},
[temptation for military planners and policymakers]{.underline}. In a
comparative historical treatment of major 19th- and 20th-century
battles, Nolan argues that "[often]{.underline}, [war results in
something clouded]{.underline}, [neither triumph nor
defeat]{.underline}. [It is an arena of **grey outcomes**]{.underline},
[partial and ambiguous resolution of disputes and causes that led to the
choice of force as an instrument of policy in the first
place]{.underline}."60 Decisive victories in any one battle are rare.
Adversaries can refuse to fight.61 They can even signal resolve through
demonstrating their ability to endure pain.

**Offensive operations are escalatory and fail.**

Planning and Assessment Pathologies

[The]{.underline} [new policy framework for offensive cyber operations
**risks compounding common pathologies**]{.underline} [associated with
strategic assessments and planning]{.underline}. 62 **[Removing
interagency checks]{.underline}** [increases the risks that an operation
will **backfire** on the attacker]{.underline} [or **compromise ongoing
operations**]{.underline}.

[**Misperception** is **pervasive**]{.underline} [in insulated
decisionmaking processes]{.underline} for several reasons.63 First,
[small groups unchecked by bureaucracy tend]{.underline} [to **produce
narrow plans**]{.underline} [prone to escalation during
crises]{.underline}.64 Second, [leaders often give guidance to planners
during crises]{.underline} [that reflects their political
bias]{.underline} [or personality traits rather than a rational
assessment]{.underline} of threats and options.65 Third, [offensive bias
in planning may have little to do with the actual threat and more to do
with a **cult of the offensive**]{.underline} [and the desire of
officers to ensure]{.underline} [their autonomy and
resources]{.underline}.66 Removing interagency checks therefore risks
compounding fundamental attribution errors and other implicit biases.
Cyber operations are too important to be left to the generals at Cyber
Command alone.

in the West that [Russia has

an "escalate to de-escalate" nuclear strategy]{.underline}, which
[lowers the
bar](https://warontherocks.com/2016/03/three-minutes-to-midnight-closer-to-nuclear-conflict-than-we-think/)
for nuclear weapons use to a terrifyingly low level. Importantly, it's
referenced as fact in the Trump administration's new [Nuclear Posture

,](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872886/-1/-1/1/2018-NUCLEAR-POSTURE-REVIEW-FINAL-REPORT.PDF)
which argues that the United States itself therefore needs new low-yield
nuclear weapons to deter Russia at lower levels of conflict. [But the
**evidence of a dropped threshold** for Russian nuclear employment **is
weak**]{.underline}. Moreover, even if this was Russia's doctrine, a
shift to more American reliance on lower-yield nuclear weapons would be
the wrong solution to the problem. Understanding Russian Doctrine [What
do people mean when they say "escalate to de-escalate?"]{.underline} The
words themselves are not particularly helpful. Any action that is
neither a perfectly symmetrical nor smaller response to adversary action
is escalation. [Any threat (nuclear or otherwise) to raise the costs of
conflict is a threat of escalation]{.underline}. [And countries both
escalate and threaten to do so fairly regularly as they seek to convince
adversaries to rethink plans]{.underline}. The fact is that [most
escalation is intended to, well, de-escalate.]{.underline} Western
analysts have developed a range of descriptions of Russian nuclear
strategy that all fall, with varying degrees of consistency and
contradiction, under the "escalate to de-escalate" umbrella. The [new

and political scientist [Matthew
Kroenig](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-case-for-tactical-u-s-nukes-1516836395)
hold that Russia intends to use nuclear weapons early in a conflict to
attain an advantageous battlefield outcome. So does current Pentagon
official [Elbridge
Colby.](https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/countering-russian-nuclear-strategy-in-central-europe)
[Juri Luik and Tomas Jermalavicius
believe](http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/umSnuTKFrMZggbaRv3SR/full)
Russia would turn to nuclear weapons in the face of imminent battlefield
defeat: e.g., to make up for conventional inferiority in a conflict with
the NATO alliance. [Evelyn Farkas
holds](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/02/15/trump-needs-a-russia-policy-or-putin-will-force-one-on-him/)
that Russia simply likes escalation, nuclear and otherwise. The notion
that Russia might use nuclear weapons on the battlefield may originate
in arguments in a 1999 paper published in the Russian military journal
Voennaia Mysl. The authors, military officers and analysts V. I.
Levshin, A. V. Nedelin, and M. E. Sosnovskii,
[posited](http://militaryarticle.ru/zarubezhnoe-voennoe-obozrenie/1999-zvo/8995-o-primenenii-jadernogo-oruzhija-dlja-dejeskalacii)
that the use of nuclear weapons in a heretofore conventional conflict
could demonstrate credibility and convince the adversary to stand down
for fear of further escalation. The argument for more nuclear steps on
the escalation ladder has been made more recently as
[well](http://nvo.ng.ru/concepts/2015-11-27/1_stairway.html). It was
even promised by a senior Russian official prior to the release of a new
military doctrine almost a decade
[ago](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/14/10/2009/5703d6e19a7947733180bb63).
[However, neither that]{.underline}
[[doctrine]{.underline}](http://carnegieendowment.org/files/2010russia_military_doctrine.pdf)
[nor the one that followed it in]{.underline}
[[2014]{.underline}](https://rusemb.org.uk/press/2029) [(the most
recent) in fact lowers the nuclear use threshold]{.underline}. As one of
us has argued
[previously](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine),
[the official statements, followed by a doctrine that did not deliver on
them, suggest that **proponents** of a lowered threshold ultimately
**lost a bureaucratic fight**]{.underline}. To this day, Russian
"escalation" advocates occasionally publish an article, still hoping to
change the policy --- but continue to fail. [Nor does Russian doctrine
call for the use of nuclear weapons if Moscow is losing a conventional
conflict]{.underline}. To the contrary, [military doctrine clearly
states that nuclear weapons will be used only in response to an
adversary using nuclear]{.underline} or other [weapons]{.underline} of
mass destruction and/[or "when the very existence of the state is
[in](https://rusemb.org.uk/press/2029)
[jeopardy.](http://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/3054726)]{.underline}"
One can argue what does and does not qualify as existential jeopardy,
but the [scenarios]{.underline} in [which Western analysts envision
Russian]{.underline} nuclear [escalation]{.underline} --- most of which
involve ending a conventional conflict --- [seem to fall short by most
definitions]{.underline}. In the past, Russia's bar for nuclear use has
been both higher and lower. In 1993, [Moscow dropped the no-first-use
pledge](http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/world/russia-drops-pledge-of-no-first-use-of-atom-arms.html)
it inherited from the Soviet Union. In 2000, however, following the NATO
air campaign in Yugoslavia, Russia's new military doctrine allowed for
first use in case of large-scale conventional aggression against Russia
or its [allies](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2000_05/dc3ma00). It is
plausible that at this time, plans indeed looked something like
"escalate to de-escalate." But soon after that, proponents of reliance
on nuclear weapons found their views eclipsed by Russian government
decisions to instead invest in conventional
[forces](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/107537). At the time, this
was mainly because Russia believed [most of its battles would be
smaller-scale](http://milrf.ru/conference/cf_030604/5ru_esin.htm).
Today, however, [Russia is [increasingly
confident](https://sputniknews.com/russia/201701121049508492-precision-weapons-russia/)
that its conventional capabilities can play at least some of the
strategic deterrence roles historically played by nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} A Secret Plan to Escalate? Those who believe in a
lowered Russian threshold for nuclear use thus believe that Russia's
formal doctrine is intentionally disingenuous. [Indeed, speculation
about a secret annex to the doctrine that clandestinely lowers the
nuclear threshold
[abounds](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017-02/escalate-de-escalate)]{.underline}.
But as [Kristin ven Bruusgaard has pointed
out](https://warontherocks.com/2017/09/the-myth-of-russias-lowered-nuclear-threshold/)
in in War on the Rocks, [if Russia's goal is deterrence, **a stated
strategy** of restraint **at odds with a real strategy** of escalation
**seems counterproductive**.]{.underline} Deterrence works best when the
adversary understands which actions will trigger an undesirable
response. Three categories of evidence are offered to support the
argument that Russia's true nuclear threshold today is lower than its
doctrine indicates: exercises, capability, and rhetoric. [Like other
nuclear states, Russia runs exercises that involve [nuclear
weapons](https://www.foi.se/reportsummary?reportNo=FOI-R--4326--SE)]{.underline}.
The vast majority of these test strategic readiness, command and
control, and interoperability. In a handful of recent cases, various

not, however, appear that scenarios for these exercises fit the model of
a small-scale nuclear strike early in a conflict]{.underline}---as one
of us has argued in the
[past](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/160504_Oliker_RussiasNuclearDoctrine_Web.pdf).
If one believes the strikes happened, conditions of a battlefield defeat
posing an existential threat to the state are more plausible. However,
as Bruno Tertrais explains, the evidence for simulated nuclear use in
large conventional exercises is itself not fully
[convincing](https://www.iiss.org/en/politics%20and%20strategy/blogsections/2018-4cda/february-e91d/does-russia-really-include-limited-nuclear-strikes-bf12).
Importantly, [Russia's most recent large-scale military exercise focused
on its Western flank]{.underline}, Zapad 2017, [did not have any evident
nuclear
[strike](https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/five-things-know-about-zapad-2017-military-exercise)
[component](https://news.err.ee/650543/michael-kofman-what-actually-happened-during-zapad-2017),
despite positing a conflict with the NATO alliance.]{.underline} Then
there's Russian capability, specifically smaller-scale, shorter-range
nuclear capabilities suitable for the battlefield. Russia maintains a
substantial legacy [arsenal](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL32572.pdf)
of nonstrategic weapons, which some may believe suggests a willingness
to use them. Moreover, in recent years, Moscow has emphasized the
development of new warfighting systems that can be deployed with either
nuclear or conventional firepower, the oft-touted Iskander being one
[example](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine).
Russia is also working on hypersonic
[systems](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine).
Finally, the "accidental" leak of plans (in the form of a presentation
slide) for a nuclear
[torpedo](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34797252) in 2015 fueled
speculation that Russia is thinking creatively about nuclear warfighting
(although the destructive power of the purported weapon would surely
have strategic, not merely "de-escalatory," effects). Some may argue
that capability is evidence enough of possible "escalate to de-escalate"
plans, and the West should therefore respond in kind. This is wrong, for
two reasons: First, weapons can be used for all sorts of things, and one
cannot plan for all possible contingencies --- only those that seem
plausible. Russia could also, in principle, plan to set off all of its
nuclear weapons at once, or fire some of them into space. If a possible
strategy is not supported by the evidence, it should not drive planning.
Second, the argument that capabilities prove intent works both ways. The
United States also has low-yield nuclear capabilities (and will have
more if proponents have their way). Should Russia therefore expect the
United States to use nuclear weapons first if American conventional
forces were losing, say in a fight against Russia over Ukraine? Indeed,
such an approach would be consistent with the American doctrine outlined
in the new Nuclear Posture Review. But while the review may make this
scenario less ludicrous than it was in the past, Russia would still be
dangerously paranoid to base its planning on the possibility. [**There
is no evidence of U.S. plans** to start an offensive war against a major
nuclear power like Russia]{.underline} or China, [much less **to use a
preemptive nuclear strike to "de-escalate" a conventional conflict**
once it went wrong.]{.underline} So what is Russia's very large
nonstrategic arsenal for, and why is it emphasizing dual-use systems?
First, as regards the nonstrategic arsenal as a whole, [Russia is quite
simply loath to give up something it has a lot of without getting
something else in return.]{.underline} Second, Moscow knows that its
nuclear capabilities make Brussels and Washington nervous. Russians did
not discuss a nuclear role for the Iskander---and, indeed, rejected the
possibility---until the Western press started describing the system as
[dual-capable.](https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia%E2%80%99s-nuclear-doctrine)
To be blunt, if not reassuring, Moscow has noticed that an emphasis on
dual-capable systems keeps the West off-balance, and sees that as a
clear benefit. This brings us to the last category of evidence for a
clandestine lowered threshold: Russian rhetoric. While some Russian
pundits recklessly talk of turning countries to
[ash](https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-kiselyov/russia-can-turn-us-to-radioactive-ash-kremlin-backed-journalist-idUSL6N0MD0P920140316),
senior officials, including President Vladimir Putin, have been far more
careful with their threats. Putin may
[mention](https://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/europe/russia-putin-crimea-nuclear/index.html)
that the Crimea crisis could, in some contingencies, have led him to
place nuclear weapons on alert. However, this never happened, and it is
something of a stretch to interpret that as meaning he would have used a
tactical nuclear weapon to end a conventional conflict. Moreover, in the
face of recent nuclear
[rhetoric](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948355557022420992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2018%2F01%2F03%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-nuclear-authority%2Findex.html)
from America's own president, the comments Putin has made seem almost
circumspect. [Putin's rhetoric is meant not to signal plans to use
nuclear weapons recklessly, but rather to remind any who may have
forgotten that Russia is a nuclear weapons state]{.underline}. While
this is prospectively destabilizing, it does not indicate a deep occult
doctrine, much less a doctrine that has been consistently and publicly
rejected. Russian rhetoric reflects the fact that Russia, much like the
Soviet Union before it, sees NATO posing a threat that needs to be
deterred. [Moscow continues to believe, and Russian generals in private
conversations emphasize, that any conventional conflict with NATO risks
rapid escalation without "de-escalation" --- into all-destroying nuclear
war. It must therefore be **avoided at all costs**]{.underline}. This
logic is consistent with that put forward by American scholars who have

[that](http://www.newsweek.com/how-nuclear-weapons-can-keep-you-safe-78907)
nuclear weapons kept the peace during the Cold War. [The success of the
nuclear peace, in this view, lay in the threat of extreme
escalation]{.underline}, not the bespoke step-by-step deterrence
the Nuclear Posture Review seems to advocate and that the postulated
Russian "de-escalation" doctrine would implicitly endorse.

Since 1945," The Washington Quarterly,
https://www.frstrategie.org/web/documents/publications/autres/2017/2017-tertrais-twq-on-the-brink.pdf

**[The short answer?]{.underline}** If we are to discard Pope John Paul
II's explanation ("Divine Providence"),5 [it is that **the system
worked** and that, with rare exceptions, those in charge of nuclear
weapons have been responsible, prudent, and careful.]{.underline}
"[**Close calls**" have ranged in fact from "**not-so-close" to "very
distant**."]{.underline}

[A number of technical incidents have taken place]{.underline} since
1945, all of which led to one degree or another to nuclear precautionary
measures, generally involving the elevation of alert levels. Most of
these incidents are well documented, but one of them does not seem to
have taken place at all. It was revealed in 2015 that in the midst of
the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Mace missile squadron based in Okinawa
received a launch order.6 The ambassador of a Latin American country to
the United Nations claimed that this incident "could have altered the
course of civilization forever." 7 One should note that according to the
account---based on a single testimony---the safeguards worked: given
that the procedure was not respected (the order came at DEFCON-2,
whereas it was supposed to happen only at DEFCON-1), the unit commander
suspended the launch.8 In any case, an in-depth inquiry by Stars &
Stripes magazine at the end of 2015 did not find any confirmation of the
incident; U.S. Air Force historians did not find any trace of it.

At least a dozen real incidents took place in the United States in the
1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. (Even though there is little or no evidence
that as many happened in other countries, one should assume that some
also occurred in the Soviet Union or elsewhere.)10 In these cases, alert
levels were elevated due to a false alarm, generally caused by the
malfunction of a technical system. For instance, in 1960 a U.S. early
warning radar in Greenland confused the moonrise with a missile
launch.11 In 1961, a dysfunctional transmitter made the Strategic Air
Command (SAC) believe that its lines of communication had been cut
off.12 In 1962, a cascade of minor incidents and misinterpretation led
to bombers being put on alert.13 The same year, a rare conjunction of
events led a U.S. radar station to believe that a Soviet missile attack
was underway.14 Something similar occurred in 1967, when a solar storm
jammed three early warning radars.15 In 1980, two incidents caused by
faulty computer chips led U.S. authorities to mistakenly believe that a
Soviet attack could be underway.

In the Soviet Union, a well-known 1983 incident of the same sort was
recently publicized through a documentary entitled The Man Who Saved The
World (2014), according to which "millions of lives were hanging by a
thread," and no less than "the end of our civilization" was at stake.17
A more sobering account of the incident casts serious doubts on whether
this was actually the case. When the alarm sounded in the Soviet nuclear
command center because of a U.S. missile launch, the officer in charge
suspected that it was a mistake and requested visual confirmation. Such
confirmation never came, and the command thus stood down.

[Some incidents involve direct human errors]{.underline}. This was the
case for the infamous magnetic tape mistake of 1979, which went up the
chain of command to the U.S. presidency. Woken up by a phone call
announcing that 200 missiles were coming in the direction of U.S.
territory, National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski requested a
confirmation.19 He was informed a couple of minutes later that ten times
that number of missiles had now been detected. The cause was the
insertion of a tape used for training and exercises in SAC computers.
Nobody knows what President Jimmy Carter would have done had Brzezinski
told him that he only had a few minutes to decide, but can one seriously
believe that he would have launched a massive counter-strike in the
absence of any confirmation that an attack was underway?

In a few of these incidents, a real launch caused confusion. In 1980,
for instance, the Soviet Union launched four submarine-launched
ballistic missiles (SLBMs) as part of an exercise, and a U.S. early
warning radar wrongly judged that one of them was going in the direction
of the United States. This evaluation was quickly corrected.

The Norwegian rocket launch of 1995 belongs in the same category and has
become another poster child for nuclear dangers. However, the episode
should rather be taken as a testimony to Russian cool-headedness.
Norwegian and American scientists launched a new type of rocket, the
Black Brant XII, in order to study weather data; they had sent word of
the launch to Moscow, but the information had not reached the
appropriate authorities. Since Black Brant XII was new, large, and with
a high-altitude trajectory, its launch was interpreted as a possible
missile strike. Some in the general staff raised the hypothesis of a
highaltitude electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) detonation. Yeltsin considered
an interception, but it soon became clear that Russia was not a target.
"After the rocket emerged onto a ballistic curve, the direction of the
flight became clear, and we could see that it would in no way touch on
Russian territory, but land in the Spitsbergen region---we calmed down
and took no serious measures ... "21 Generals Vladimir Dvorkin, a
well-known Russian expert, and Eugene Habiger, former head of STRATCOM,
denied that the incident had any character of gravity.

The System Worked

[Based on the above examples, one must wonder: **is luck a necessary
hypothesis** to explain why none of these events led to nuclear
war?]{.underline} Is it not at least equally possible that since 1945,
people in charge of nuclear weapons "have taken greater care \[of them\]
than is taken in any other situation involving human agents and complex
mechanical systems"?

[Nuclear-armed countries have **set up mechanisms** designed **to
ensure** that nuclear **weapons will not be used by
mistake**]{.underline}. [This includes fail-safe procedures]{.underline}
(where non-use remains the default condition up until the last possible
moment) [as well as dual phenomenology]{.underline} (the need to confirm
the attack by two independent means relying on different physical
principles). [When The Man Who Saved The World was shown in New York
City]{.underline}, t[he Russian mission]{.underline} to the United
Nations [issued a communiqué that stated: "Under no circumstances a
decision to use nuclear weapons could be made or even
considered]{.underline} in the Soviet Union (Russia) or in the United
States [on the basis of data from a single source or a
system]{.underline}. For this to happen, a [confirmation is necessary
from **several systems**:]{.underline} ground-based radars,
early-warning satellites, intelligence reports, etc." 24 [In all the
incidents mentioned above, **safety mechanisms worked**, even in the
early 1960s **when they were still rudimentary**.]{.underline}

Furthermore, is it credible to imagine that the head of a State or
government would order a nuclear strike without being certain that a
major military attack was underway? [U.S. nuclear expert Jeffrey G.
Lewis rightly argues that he cannot imagine that an American president
would embark in nuclear reprisals if there was the slightest doubt on
the reality of the attack.]{.underline}25 Retired Russian General
Vladimir Dvorkin thinks similarly, claiming that "[**No president**, no
matter what president it is, **will ever make a decision** about
launch-on warning b**ased on information about one rocket** or missile
or even ... two or three missiles]{.underline}."

From the point of view of logic and complex systems analysis, it remains
possible that a combination of incidents can lead to the failure of all
safety mechanisms designed to prevent accidental nuclear war. Such a
thesis is embodied by the classic work of Scott D. Sagan, The Limits of
Safety. It would thus only be "a matter of time" due to cumulative
probabilities.27 In a recent documentary about nuclear risks, author
Eric Schlosser reiterates the point: "it's also due to luck, pure luck,
and the problem with luck is that eventually it runs out ... Every
machine ever invented eventually goes wrong."

[But the probability of failure increases markedly with time only if
conditions do not change---and conditions do change.]{.underline}
[Safety mechanisms have been perfected]{.underline} (without necessarily
becoming more complex) and lessons of past incidents are being learned.
Sagan claimed in 1993 that the Yom Kippur war (see below), as well as
the 1979 and 1980 incidents (see above), are proof that organizations
fail to learn from experience. But if that was the case, why would the
number of known incidents have significantly declined since 1983? We
only know of one significant incident in nearly 35 years: the Black
Brant XII episode. Charles [**Perrow**, the father of "normal accidents"
theory]{.underline} (those resulting from the complexity and
interconnection of systems), [wrote]{.underline}: "with regard to firing
\[nuclear weapons\] after a false warning we reach a surprising
conclusion, one I was not prepared for: [because of the safety systems
involved in a launchon-warning scenario, it is **virtually impossible**
for wellintended actions **to bring about an accidental
attack.**]{.underline}

**[Nuclear Crises]{.underline}**

A second type of crisis involves episodes during which there was an
alleged risk of deliberate nuclear use. One has to differentiate between
types of crises: to say that the use of nuclear weapons was "discussed"
for instance, is different from "considered" or from "planned." [A
closer look at them suggests that in most cases, there was an elevation
of alert levels and/or various forms of nuclear signaling]{.underline},
and in some cases contingency planning, [but **no evidence of
intention** of, or temptation **to**, actually **employ nuclear weapons
in almost all cases**]{.underline}. As is the case for false alarms,
many of the known cases involve U.S. nuclear forces. But there is no
evidence in the public domain that the Soviet Union ever considered the
use of nuclear weapons outside the East--West confrontation, for
instance.

False Nuclear Events

One should start with the nuclear crises that were not. Many episodes
sometimes labeled as such did not have any nuclear dimension. There was
no "nuclear ultimatum" during the Azerbaijan crisis of 1946, for
instance, despite what President Truman himself claimed.30 Nor was there
any significant nuclear dimension to the Falklands war of 1982, despite
reports to the contrary.

On some of the most-often mentioned episodes, there are important
question marks. The famous Kissinger "DEFCON 3" initiative of October
1973, aimed at deterring Moscow from intervening in the Middle East
during the Yom Kippur war, involved all U.S. forces, not merely nuclear
ones. There was never any explicit nuclear signal or threat during the
crisis, and it is far from certain that nuclear weapons per se played
any role then.

Likewise for the Kashmir crisis of 1990, a moment of high tension
between Pakistan and India. Despite initial reports to the contrary,
which were thinly sourced, it seems that there was never any significant
nuclear dimension in it--- if at all. A roundtable organized in 1994
involving participants in the crisis concluded that the two countries
were never on the nuclear brink during that spring.33 Another in-depth
study of the crisis one year later led to the same conclusion.34 There
may have been confusion between regular, unrelated Pakistani nuclear
activities and deliberate crisis-time decisions.35 The former head of
Pakistani weapons designs has stated that his country did not have a
weaponized device at the time.3

One crisis deserves a separate treatment. By the fall of 1983, a
particularly tense moment of the Cold War, NATO was conducting the final
phase (Able Archer) of its annual Autumn Forge exercise, which was more
elaborate than in previous years.37 Moscow increased the alert of a
significant number of forces including nuclear units. NATO simulated
nuclear strikes on the 9th and 11th of November. How dangerous was the
crisis? A 2008 British documentary claimed that the world had come very
close to catastrophe,38 but more information is available today. "We
knew that NATO were \[sic\] doing an exercise," said General Ivan Yesin,
then head of Soviet strategic forces.39 His opinion is reflected by
those of other former Soviet and Warsaw Pact officials.40 Note that by
November 11, even as the NATO exercise reached its climax, the Soviet
alert had been withdrawn and normal flights had resumed. Most indepth
analyses of the 1983 crisis all concur that Moscow did not really fear
an attack and that the alert was just a precautionary one.41 One should
also note that the Pershing 2 missiles, which were in Moscow's view a
possible instrument for a surprise attack, had not yet been deployed to
Germany: the first ones arrived on November 23.

Nuclear Signaling

Instances of deliberate nuclear signaling through verbal threats or ad
hoc deployments were frequent during the Cold War, and most of them have
been well documented: the Berlin blockade of 1948--1949, the Suez crisis
of 1956, the status of Berlin crisis of 1958, the U.S. intervention in
Lebanon that same year, the October 1962 retaliatory threat by President
Kennedy, the Sino--Soviet Ussuri skirmishes of 1969, the India--Pakistan
war of 1971, and the Vietnam War all belong to that category. But there
is no evidence in the public domain that such episodes included either
nuclear contingency planning or serious consideration of nuclear use.

What about India--Pakistan crises post-1998 (the year both countries
tested nuclear devices)? In 1999, there were threats on both sides, and
some evidence of an increase in alert levels of Indian missiles.42 There
is no clear evidence of the same steps being taken on the Pakistani
side: during the crisis, the head of Pakistani nuclear forces was in
Switzerland.43 This is also true for the 2001-- 2002 "Twin Peaks"
crisis, during which there is no evidence, despite some heated rhetoric,
that either of the two sides was ready to embark in nuclear
brinkmanship. A former Pakistani nuclear official reports that Islamabad
did not change the alert level of its forces during the crisis.

The Ukrainian crisis that began in 2014 has seen many small nuclear
signals, including an increase in flights of Russian nuclear-capable
bombers around the European continent. But the only known instance of a
clear nuclear-related threat by Russian authorities referred to a
hypothetical past situation. In 2015, answering a question about raising
alert levels at the height of the Crimean crisis a few months before,
Vladimir Putin said, "We were ready to do it," but seemed to refer to a
situation where Western forces would have tried to repel Russia in
Crimea, since he added, "Historically, this territory is ours. Russians
live there. They were in danger." 45 Hardly a case of nuclear coercion.

Contingency Planning

[Then we have crises where contingency planning was indeed
made]{.underline}---an indication that nuclear use was possible.
[However, there is no evidence that any political leader had his or her
"finger on the button" in any of these episodes]{.underline}. In some
cases, the use of nuclear weapons was suggested by subordinates and not
pursued further. Twice in 1950, General MacArthur suggested such use in
Korea, but his requests were rejected.46 In 1967, some in the Israeli
government seem to have considered a nuclear demonstration in the Sinai
if Egypt threatened the country's urban centers.47 In 1968, U.S.
commanders in Vietnam recommended the use of theater nuclear weapons to
defend Khe Sanh, but senior military authorities disagreed.48 In 1973,
it seems that part of Israel's nuclear arsenal was put on alert49---but
even at the darkest hour, as is now known through the testimony of a
direct witness, Prime Minister Golda Meir categorically refused the
nuclear demonstration suggested by General Moshe Dayan.50 Finally, in
1980, a Pentagon study reportedly considered the same option in case of
a Soviet invasion of Iran;51 but the contingency never came up.

The more interesting cases are those where the approach was "top-down,"
i.e. where nuclear contingency planning was ordered by the highest
political authorities. In 1954, Washington considered striking the
Vietminh's positions around Dien Bien Phu to support the beleaguered
French forces.52 President Eisenhower was reluctant: he wanted to do it
only in the case of an international intervention; he also doubted the
added value of nuclear (as opposed to conventional) weapons. In any
case, "Eisenhower never came close to approving any action to save Dien
Bien Phu," as former National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy describes.

During the 1961 Berlin crisis, nuclear options were discussed in
depth---a discussion that contributed to the emergence of the flexible
response doctrine---but only in case of a war over Berlin, which never
materialized.

In 1969, Henry Kissinger ordered the Pentagon to elaborate bombing plan
Duck Hook, designed to force Hanoi to negotiate. It is possible (though
still not certain to this day) that it included small-scale nuclear
options. The plan was shortlived.55 Despite his bravado, President Nixon
was aware of the political costs of using nuclear weapons in Southeast
Asia.56 In fact, Kissinger said later that during his time in
government, "there was no situation in which we were involved, in which
we ever made a plan for using nuclear weapons \[apart from the Single
Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP, the massive war plan to respond to a
Soviet attack)\]." 57 The famous journalist Seymour Hersh himself, a
staunch critic of the administration, admits that he never found any
evidence of an imminent use of nuclear weapons at that time.

Finally, one should mention the 1990 request by Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to evaluate the results of a use of theater nuclear weapons on
Iraqi forces. Mr. Cheney would later say that he was acting out of
"curiosity" and for the sake of "comprehensiveness." The study was
immediately destroyed.5

Serious Consideration of Nuclear Use

We are left then with three cases where the use of nuclear weapons seems
to have been very seriously considered: the Korean War, the two Formosa
Strait crises in the 1950s, and of course the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Korea and Formosa

As soon as the Korean War began, President Truman ordered the
preparation of attack plans in case the Soviet Union was to enter the
fray.60 He sent B29 nuclear bombers twice in the region, in 1950 and
1951---the second time with several assembled weapons. However, in June
1951, a Joint Staff study threw cold water on these plans by concluding
an absence of "good" targets for nuclear use.

The use of nuclear weapons was also seriously discussed several times at
the beginning of the Eisenhower administration, between February and May
1953.62 One contingency plan involved the large-scale tactical and
strategic (on Chinese territory) use of nuclear weapons.63 On May 20,
the U.S. president secretly approved this option in the form of a
memorandum entitled "NSC Action 794" to be executed if circumstances
warranted a resumption of offensive action---which never came, since the
Armistice was signed in July.64 As described by Columbia University
professor Richard Betts, "NSC Action 794 was not a commitment, but it
was as close to a final decision as a president can come, short of the
moment of execution." 65 Nobody knows what Eisenhower would have decided
had fighting erupted again.

In any event, several reasons prevented the use of nuclear weapons
during the Korean War.66 As documented, inter alia, by Nina Tannenwald
and T.V. Paul, both presidents appeared seriously concerned with the
international reputation of the United States.67 And in almost all
scenarios, the use of nuclear weapons did not offer any prospect to make
a serious difference on the ground.

During the Formosa Strait (also known as the Taiwan Strait) crises of
1954-- 1955 as well as 1958, nuclear use was seriously considered in
case of an invasion of Taiwan.69 But that was to come only as a last
resort, for fear of allied reactions or Soviet escalation. Eisenhower
was prepared but not "anxious" to use nuclear weapons.70 Despite his
public positions on the subject, a U.S. Air Force report made clear that
"the President simply did not accept the contention that nuclear weapons
were as conventional as high explosives."

The Cuban Missile Crisis seems to remain the only moment since 1945 when
the world came really close to nuclear use. This refers less to the
retaliatory threat that President Kennedy publicly made in case a
missile was launched against the Americas,72 instead referring more to
three specific episodes about which the details only became public in
the 1990s.

First, on October 24, 1962, the U.S. Navy attempted to force a B29
Soviet submarine to surface. The U.S. crew was unable to reach the
general staff.73 An "exhausted" and "furious" Soviet captain Vassili
Savitsky considered putting the ship's 15-kiloton nuclear torpedo in
operational condition. He told his crew: "We're going to blast them now!
We will die, but we will sink them all---we will not disgrace our Navy."
74 The traditional account holds that only the fortuitous presence in
the submarine of the fleet commander, Vassili Arkhipov, prevented the
shot, since he voted against it. But this version is questionable.
According to the Soviet Navy rules, the circumstances for allowing the
torpedo strike were not met: written rules of engagement stated that it
was possible only on Moscow's orders.75 Also, it is by no means certain
that any real vote took place. [The commander "consulted" Arkhipov and
deputy political officer Ivan Maslennikov---and they were both opposed.
Viktor Mikhailov, an officer on board, testified that "**Savitski never
lost it**."]{.underline}

In the second episode, on October 27 at the height of the crisis, U.S.
radars in Alaska detected two Soviet MiG-19s attempting to intercept a
U.S. U2 reconnaissance plane, which was flying towards the Kola
Peninsula due to a navigation error. Two U.S. F-102s took off to
accompany the plane, armed with Falcon nuclear air to-air missiles.
However, Khrushchev declared in his memoirs that the Soviet Union would
not have intercepted the plane under such circumstances (even less with
nuclear missiles) before ascertaining that it was not a navigation
error.

In the third episode, Soviet forces in Cuba were endowed with theater
nuclear weapons, and rules of engagement initially allowed them to be
used in case of an invasion if no contact with Moscow was possible.
However, Khrushchev took the initiative on October 26 to alter those
rules as to ensure that a Kremlin order would be a prerequisite.

[The Tradition of Non-Use Is Strong]{.underline}

The Cuban crisis reveals that Soviet and U.S. officials were able to
refrain from foolish judgments even in conditions of extreme stress.
Adversaries have never put at stake the "vital interests" of their
opponents---either because they were unable to, or because they never
intended to, or simply because they feared retaliation. [The barriers to
the use of nuclear weapons were solid, and the "tradition of non-use"
emerged very quickly.]{.underline}

One last element of the anti-nuclear narrative deserves discussion.
There is no certainty at all that any use of a nuclear weapon would turn
into a major nuclear war. Yes, Cuba was a time of great danger. [But why
would the use of a nuclear torpedo]{.underline}, for instance,
[necessarily have led to a global thermonuclear exchange? **Is it** not
at least **equally likely** that **the two countries would** have done
their best to **limit escalation**?]{.underline} It is possible, as
Herman Kahn famously argued, that "[**the nuclear threshold is not so
weak** that **a single use** of nuclear weapons **would make anyone
careless** about crossing it a second time]{.underline}."

Escalation in the nuclear age would not necessarily be a descent into
the abyss. It might very well be the equivalent of walking up a
staircase where the last stairs are considerably higher than the first
ones. Resistance to actual use or launch could increase as one moves up
the escalation ladder---not unlike two magnets repelling each other.

[**The narrative** claiming that **the world has stood** many times
"**on the brink of apocalypse**]{.underline}," or that we were within a
"hair's breadth" of a nuclear catastrophe, thus [deserves
deconstruction]{.underline}. [It **discards** the strength of the
**technical, operational, or mental safety valves** that prevent nuclear
use]{.underline}. Stanislas Petrov, the "man who saved the world," was
not a superhero who single-handedly stopped a runaway train: he was an
average Soviet official who applied procedures.

Some legitimate questions remain. What would happen if a false alarm
erupted during wartime? If a full-blown conflict involving nuclear-armed
countries erupted---something that has never happened, probably thanks
to deterrence---can we assume that caution would still prevail? This is
an important question and a legitimate preoccupation. The absence of any
such conflict since 1945 suggests that nuclear deterrence is a robust
construct---but no human construct is infallible. Whether it is for
safety mechanisms or for deterrence, even "virtually impossible" does
not mean zero. Some would argue that any probability of a nuclear war is
too much. But surely this does not close the discussion: a very small
probability of a deadly car accident has to be balanced against the
benefits of driving to work, for instance. Is the nuclear system
"tolerably safe"? 80 The conversation between proponents of deterrence
and anti-nuclear activists should revolve around the costs and benefits
equation. It is also far from certain that such safety mechanisms and
human resistance will always be present in the decision-making complexes
of all nuclear-armed states (think North Korea or Pakistan, for
instance).

Nevertheless, [a history of **nearly 40 crises** with some nuclear
dimension has **taught** an important lesion: **solid
command-and-control** arrangements, **sound procedures**, **constant
vigilance**, **efficient training**, and **cool-headedness of
leadership** have ensured---and can **continue to ensure**---that
nuclear weapons will continue to play only a deterrence
role]{.underline}. "**[Luck" has very little to do with

[There's been a lot of discussion lately about the risks posed by
hackers to America's critical infrastructure systems, with terms like
"cyber-Pearl Harbor" and "cyber-9/11"]{.underline} being bandied about
by government officials and other prominent figures.¶ Invariably, [one
of the worst scenarios often depicted by these cyberwar predictions is
an attack on the US power grid that would cause a widespread
blackout.]{.underline}¶ In his testimony before the House Intelligence
Committee on November 20th, NSA Director Adm. Michael Rogers went into
some detail on those risks:¶ House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike
Rogers: ["It was determined that malware was on those (critical
infrastructure) systems. Can you be a little more definitive about what
does that mean? If I'm on that system and I want to do some harm, what
does that do ... ? Do the lights go out? Do we stop pumping water? What
does that really mean? And the fact that it was there]{.underline},
**[does that mean they already have the capability to 'flip the switch'
if they wanted to?"]{.underline}¶** Admiral Michael Rogers: "Well let me
address the last part first. [There shouldn't be any doubt in our minds
that there are nation-states and groups out there that have the
capability to do that]{.underline}. To enter our systems, to enter those
industrial control systems, and to shut down, forestall our ability to
operate, our basic infrastructure. Whether it's generating power across
this nation, whether it's moving water and fuel ... Once you're into the
system and you're able to do that, it enables you to do things like, if
I want to tell power turbines to go offline and stop generating power,
you can do that. If I wanted to segment the transmission system so that
you couldn't distribute the power that was coming out of the power
stations, this would enable you to do that. It enables you to shut down
very segmented, very tailored parts of our infrastructure."¶ [A number
of media outlets interpreted these comments as a claim by the NSA that a
country like China could take down our nation's power grid. But is that
what the NSA director really said? And is a widespread, national
blackout caused by hackers a realistic scenario?¶]{.underline} While
it's easy to draw that conclusion from the generalized nature of Adm.
Rogers' responses, it's important to re-read the last line in that
exchange: "It enables you to shut down very segmented, very tailored
parts of our infrastructure." (Emphasis added.)¶ This line is important
because it clarifies the types of risks we're actually talking about
when it comes to the electric grid. [**No**, hackers can't take down the
entire, or even a widespread portion of the US electric
grid]{.underline}. From a logistical standpoint, [this would be **far
too difficult** to realistically pull off]{.underline} - and it's not
what we should be devoting our attention to. What is more realistic is
for a cyber attack to ~~cripple~~ \[devastate\] an individual utility,
causing a blackout or disruption of service at the local level.¶ The
power grid is vulnerable to attack --- there's no question about that.
In my own work, testing the security readiness of US and global energy
companies and utilities, I regularly find serious vulnerabilities on
these networks and I am often called in to deal with compromises that
have already taken place --- including cyber-espionage activities by
state-sponsored groups.¶ Adm. Rogers testimony is extremely important as
it provides a strong authoritative voice to what is an urgent problem
facing this country right now: America's critical infrastructure is
vulnerable to attack, it's a complicated problem to fix it and an attack
is eminent. But the notion that a hacker could basically turn off the
country's power with the 'flip of a switch,' as Rep. Rogers called it,
is more science fiction than reality.¶ Here's why:¶ [The US energy grid
is owned and operated by hundreds of various regional utilities that all
use different hardware and software. That means hackers would have to
tunnel into hundreds of diverse networks, which would take several
years, and then write custom exploits which are unique for each specific
environment they're targeting]{.underline}. [For those who would argue
that China]{.underline} or Russia [have the money]{.underline}, time and
capability to do that, [try to understand that developing a functional
exploit, getting it placed on the exact part of the network that it
needs to be on in order to have the desired effect]{.underline} (i.e.,
specific programmable logic controllers that run the utility's
machinery), [then keeping it hidden on that network over a period of
months or years while security teams try to hunt it down, and doing all
of this at the same time on hundreds of networks is extremely
difficult]{.underline}. [To put it in perspective, **it would be like
trying to rob a hundred different banks at the exact same
time.**]{.underline}¶ However, [even if a hacker group was able to pull
this off, there is a catch-all that would create yet another hurdle.
**There are high-voltage DC interconnects at various points that were
specifically designed to prevent widespread outages.**]{.underline}**¶**
By clarifying what we mean when we warn about attacks on the electric
grid and other critical infrastructure, I'm not trying to downplay this
risk at all. US critical infrastructure networks, which include the
electric grid, utilities, oil/gas refineries and pipelines, water
treatment plants, transportation networks, etc., are all highly
vulnerable to cyber attacks, and this threat should be prioritized at
the highest level by the federal government.¶ In the meantime, the
individual asset owners who are the ones technically responsible for
securing their networks and facilities need to start taking more
aggressive steps immediately to guard against highly sophisticated cyber
actors. [But the real risk when it comes to the electric grid
specifically is of localized disruptions in service --- not a widespread
outage. It would be extremely difficult for hackers, without an almost
superhuman effort, to cause a power outage that stretched across the
country.]{.underline}

#### Total shut-down would be next to impossible and the impact is overblown -- literally squirrels statistically pose more of a threat

**Chow 14** - Eugene K. Chow, journalist for the Week January 28, 2014
\"Forget hackers: Squirrels are a bigger threat to America\'s power
grid\"
theweek.com/articles/452311/forget-hackers-squirrels-are-bigger-threat-americas-power-grid

[While American lawmakers and security officials repeatedly warn of a
catastrophic cyberattack that will ~~cripple~~ \[devastate\] the
nation\'s power grids, in reality, squirrels and tree branches are
proving more troublesome than hackers when it comes to actual power
outages.¶]{.underline} According to numerous reports and headlines:
America\'s power grid is \"too vulnerable to cyberattack;\" thousands
will die if terrorists attack the grid; cyber attacks could keep America
in the dark for nine to 18 months; and electric companies face \"daily\"
cyber attacks, which over a month can build to 10,000.¶ [With cyber
security so abysmal, incentive so high, and attacks constant, why
hasn\'t there been a massive hacker-triggered power failure yet? Simply
put, because **it\'s not that easy.**¶]{.underline} To be clear, attacks
on the power grid would be disastrous and there are significant gaps
that must be addressed --- procedures improved, vulnerabilities patched,
software updated --- but even with these glaring weaknesses, [an
ordinary hacker wouldn\'t be able to take down the electrical grid.
Turning America\'s lights off remotely is a complex operation that
requires not only hacking expertise but an array of intelligence and
analysis]{.underline} --- something only the most sophisticated
terrorist organizations or nation states can muster.¶ [Take one of the
grid\'s greatest cyber vulnerabilities, SCADA]{.underline} (supervisory
control and data acquisition) software. It allows utility companies to
remotely monitor and control facilities, which has the unfortunate
consequence of also [giving hackers the ability to sabotage the grid
from afar.¶]{.underline} While terrifying in theory, cyber security
expert Bruce Schneier explains that [SCADA vulnerabilities are
\"overblown\" and the reports are \"hype.\"]{.underline} [Actually
hacking into SCADA software and causing physical damage to a system is
exceptionally difficult]{.underline}. In fact, the only known SCADA
attack to cause damage was the Stuxnet virus, which was created after
years of intensive research and espionage by Israel and America\'s most
advanced spies and engineers to damage a secret Iranian nuclear
facility.¶ Veteran intelligence officer Michael Tanji points out in
Wired just how complex such an attack would be. For starters [SCADA
systems are \"rarely connected directly to the public internet,\" which
makes \"gaining access to grid-controlling networks a challenge for all
but the most dedicated, motivated and skilled --- nation-states, in
other words.\"¶ If hackers were somehow able to enter the system, to
actually cause physical damage Tanji explains, they would still need to
have **advanced intelligence gathering** abilities to learn which SCADA
software utilities are running, how they are connected, what the
generator blueprints look like, which weaknesses exist in equipment, how
to exploit those weaknesses, which machines are linked, how to override
safety mechanisms and keep engineers or automatic safeguards from
stepping in, and much more.¶]{.underline} In other words, [\"a purely
online approach is simply not going to provide you with the type and
volume of information you are going to need to accomplish your
mission,\"]{.underline} Tanji said. \"You\'re going to have to deploy
national-level resources.\"¶ Meanwhile, as lawmakers worry over these
highly sophisticated hypothetical attacks, the nation\'s aging power
grid is falling apart all by itself.¶ In its annual report on US
infrastructure, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the
electric grid, some of which dates back to the 1880s, a \"D-plus\" as
the number of power failures continues to rise.¶ [According to a study
by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, between 1965
and 1988, there were three major power failures. From 2000 to 2005,
there were 11 and from 2006 to 2009, there were 33. **The primary
cause** of these failures **was weather.**¶]{.underline} More troubling
is the fact that [the second largest blackout]{.underline} in history,
the 2003 Northeast blackout that left more than 50 million without power
for two days, **[was caused by power lines brushing against tree
branches in Ohio.]{.underline}**¶ [Even **squirrels** are proving to be,
well, a squirrelly problem. No one really knows how much damage the
rodents do, but **it\'s certainly more than hackers
manage**]{.underline}. A cursory analysis in The New York Times found
that over a four month span last year, [squirrels caused at least **50**
power outages]{.underline} across the country --- and those were just
the ones that made the news. And while no one knows how many people are
affected by squirrel-related outages each year, in just two days last
June, four squirrel-related incidents left more than 18,000 homes in
four different states in the dark. How do squirrels manage such mayhem?
[They simply chew through wires or scamper over fragile electrical
equipment.]{.underline}¶ If squirrels weren\'t troublesome enough, on
the more malicious end, [there has been a sharp increase in the number
of physical attacks]{.underline} on America\'s energy infrastructure and
authorities are struggling to find who\'s responsible.¶ Last year,
[Arkansas suffered three separate attacks]{.underline} on the electrical
grid that left thousands without power including a substation being lit
on fire, [the chopping down of two key utility poles with a stolen
tractor]{.underline}, and an attempt to use a train to pull down a
100-foot transmission tower.¶ [Meanwhile in California, an individual
entered a substation and cut several cables, knocking out 911 calls,
landlines, and cell service in the area before firing a high-powered
rifle at transformers, which ultimately shut down the transformer
bank.¶]{.underline} Military-grade hackers could certainly trigger a
blackout for the ages, but with saboteurs waltzing into power stations
and causing mayhem with impunity, tree branches leaving millions in the
dark, and squirrels wrecking havoc, there are more clear and present
dangers to worry about.

power grid]{.underline}. Even laying the groundwork for such a cyber
operation could qualify as an act of war against the U.S. --- a line
that few nation-state-backed hacker crews would wish to cross. [None
denied that determined hackers could penetrate the networks of bulk

#### Extremely small risk even if there's an extended blackout 

**Bradley** **16** (Arthur, PhD in Electrical Engineering, former NASA
engineer, "Would A Long-Duration Blackout Cause Nuclear Armageddon?"
February 3,
http://www.thesurvivalistblog.net/would-a-long-duration-blackout-cause-nuclear-armageddon/)

The [risks]{.underline} of nuclear power [are many]{.underline}, but
[two stand above]{.underline} the rest. [The first is]{.underline} that
the [fuel assemblies]{.underline} in the reactor [might
overheat]{.underline}. [That would only occur if the fission process
became uncontrolled]{.underline} or if the cooling system failed. Should
overheating occur, the fuel rods' zirconium cladding and nuclear
materials could both melt, resulting in a nuclear sludge akin to molten
lava. That slag would be so hot that it might melt through the bottom of
the reinforced reactor. Eventually, it would cool enough to harden, but
not before it had spewed nuclear contaminants into the air. Melting
zirconium also releases hydrogen, which could lead to an explosion that
might actually expel the nuclear material into the surrounding
area---think Fukushima. [The good news is that nuclear fission can be
stopped in **under one second**]{.underline} [through the insertion of
control rods]{.underline}. [Those]{.underline} control rods [are
**automatically inserted**]{.underline} near the fuel rods either by a
hydraulic system or through the use of an electromagnetic deadman switch
that activates when power is removed. [That means that when the
electrical grid goes down]{.underline} or an emergency shutdown is
initiated, **[fission would automatically stop one second
later]{.underline}**. [That's a good thing]{.underline}, [but it doesn't
make the reactor inherently safe. Even without fission]{.underline}, the
fuel rod [assemblies remain]{.underline} incredibly h[o]{.underline}t,
perhaps a thousand degrees C. [If they were not actively
cooled]{.underline}, pressure and [temperatures would build]{.underline}
in the reactor until something breaks---not good. [After three days of
active cooling]{.underline}, [however, the reactor would be thermally
**cool enough to open**]{.underline}, should it be deemed necessary to
remove the fuel rod assemblies. [The second]{.underline} major
[risk]{.underline} [has to do with]{.underline} cooling of the [spent
fuel]{.underline} rod assemblies. Nuclear fuel rod assemblies have a
usable life on the order of 54-72 months (depending on reactor type).
Every 18-24 months, the reactor is brought down and serviced. While it
is down, the fuel rod assemblies are removed, and 1/3 of them are
replaced with fresh assemblies. Think of this like rotating cans of food
in your emergency pantry. In the U.S., fuel rods are not refurbished
like in other countries. Instead, they are carefully stored in giant
pools of water laced with boric acid---imagine a swimming pool at your
local YMCA that is 75-feet deep. Those spent fuel rod assemblies are
still incredibly radioactive, and they continue to generate heat. Water
in the pool must therefore be circulated to keep them cool. How long
must the fuel rods be cooled? According to Mr. Hopson, the answer is 5-7
years. After that, the rods are cool enough to be removed and stored in
reinforced concrete casks. Even then, the rods continue to be
radioactive, but their heat output can be passively managed. Nuclear
[plants]{.underline} obviously [require electricity to
operate]{.underline} their [cooling pumps]{.underline}, not to mention
their control systems. That power is normally tapped off of the
electricity that the reactor generates. If the plant is offline, the
power is provided by the electrical grid. But [what happens when the
grid]{.underline} itself [goes down? The]{.underline} [short answer
is]{.underline} that large [on-site diesel generators **automatically
activate**]{.underline} to provide electricity. [And if those should
fail]{.underline}, [portable diesel generators, which are **also
on-site**,]{.underline} can be connected. [Recent **standardization**
has also ensured that generators can be swapped between plants without
the need to retrofit connectors. There are]{.underline} also a couple of
[additional emergency]{.underline} systems [that can be used
specifically to cool the reactor]{.underline}. [These include the
turbine-driven-auxiliary-feedwater pump, which uses steam generated by
the reactor to power a cooling turbine]{.underline}. [The pump requires
an operator]{.underline}, [but it runs **completely without
electricity**]{.underline}. This system, however, is meant only for
emergency cooling of the reactor during those critical first few days
when the fuel rod assemblies are being brought down in temperature, not
for long-term cooling. And finally, **[in the worst case]{.underline}**,
[most plants have a method of bringing in river or ocean water to
**flood the reactor**.]{.underline} [This typically damages the cooling
system, but again, it helps to cool and cover the reactor core should
all else fail]{.underline}. Unlike in other countries, [permission from
the federal government is not required to flood the reactor. With
**backup systems to the backup systems**]{.underline}, [it would seem
that there's nothing to worry about]{.underline}, right? Under all but
the direst of circumstances, I think that assessment is correct.
However, [one could imagine a scenario in which the grid]{.underline}
[was lost and the diesel generators ran out of fuel]{.underline}.
Speaking of fuel, how much is actually stored onsite? It depends on the
plant, but at the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, for example, [there is enough
fuel to run the emergency diesel generators for **at least 42
days.**]{.underline} I say at least because it would depend on exactly
what was being powered. [Once the reactor was cooled down,]{.underline}
a [much smaller system, known as the Residual Heat Removal System, would
be all that was required to keep the fuel assemblies cool,]{.underline}
both in the reactor and the spent fuel rods pool. The
[generators]{.underline} and onsite fuel supply [could power that
smaller cooling system for **significantly longer**]{.underline} [than
if they were powering the larger reactor cooling system.]{.underline}
**[Even if we assumed a worst case]{.underline}** of forty-two days,
[it's hard to imagine a scenario in which that would not be enough time
to bring in additional fuel either by land, water, or air]{.underline}.
[Nonetheless, let's push the question]{.underline} a little further.
What would happen in the unlikely event that the diesel fuel was
exhausted? [Even with the reactor]{.underline} having been successfully
[cooled]{.underline}, [the biggest risk would continue to be
overheating]{.underline} of the fuel rod assemblies, both in the reactor
and the spent fuel rods pool. Without circulation, the heat from the
fuel rod assemblies could boil the surrounding water, resulting in
steam. In turn, the water levels would drop, ultimately exposing the
fuel rods to air. [Once exposed to air, their temperatures would
rise]{.underline} [but not to the levels that would melt the zirconium
cladding.]{.underline} [Thankfully, that means that meltdown **would not
occur**]{.underline}. The [steam might well carry radioactive
contaminants]{.underline} into the air, [but there would be no release
of hydrogen]{.underline} [and, thus, **no subsequent
explosions**]{.underline}. [The situation would certainly be dangerous
to surrounding communities, but it **wouldn't be the nuclear Armageddon
that many people worry about.**]{.underline}

Not only was the discussion enlightening about the reasons why different
people end up with different opinions about climate change responses
when presented with essentially the same body of information, but it
also got me thinking about a possible way to fight back against the
Gundersens, Caldicotts, Riccios, Grossmans and Wassermans of the world.
[That group]{.underline} of five [tend to use apocalyptic rhetoric to
describe what will happen to the world if we do not immediately start
turning our]{.underline} collective [backs on]{.underline} all of the
benefits that abundant [atomic energy]{.underline} can provide. They
spin tall tales of deformed children, massive numbers of cancers as a
result of minor radioactive material releases, swaths of land made
"uninhabitable" for thousands of years, countries "cut in half", and
clouds of "hot particles" raining death and destruction ten thousand
miles from the release point. [Every one of those clowns have been
repeating similar stories for at least two solid decades, and continue
to repeat their stories even after]{.underline} supposedly catastrophic
failures at [Fukushima have not resulted in a single radiation related
injury or death]{.underline}. According to eminent scientists -- like
Dr. Robert Gale -- [Fukushima is unlikely to EVER result in any
measurable increase in radiation related illness.]{.underline} One
important element that we have to consider to assess cancer risks
associated with an accident like Fukushima is our baseline risk for
developing cancer. All of us, unfortunately, have a substantial risk of
developing cancer in our lifetime. For example, a 50-year-old male has a
42% risk of developing cancer during his remaining life; it's almost the
same for a 10-year-old. This risk only decreases when we get much older
and only because we are dying of other causes. It's true that excess
radiation exposure can increase our cancer risk above baseline levels;
it's clear from studies of the survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, of people exposed to radiation in medical and
occupational settings, and of people exposed to radon decay products in
mines and home basements. When it comes to exposures like that of
Fukushima, the question is: What is the relative magnitude of the
increased risk from Fukushima compared to our baseline cancer risk?
Despite our fears, it is quite small. If the nuclear industry -- as
small and unfocused as it is -- really wanted to take action to isolate
the apocalyptic antinuclear activists, it could take a page from the
effective campaign of the fossil fuel lobby. It could start an
integrated campaign to help the rest of us to remember that, despite the
dire predictions, the sky never fell, the predicted unnatural deaths
never occurred, the deformations were figments of imagination, and the
land is not really irreversibly uninhabitable for generations. The
industry would effectively share the story of Ukraine's recent decision
to begin repopulating the vast majority of the "dead zone" that was
forcibly evacuated after the Chernobyl accident. It would put some
context into the discussion about radiation health effects; even if
leaders shy away from directly challenging the Linear No Threshold (LNT)
dose assumption, they can still show that even that pessimistic model
says that a tiny dose leads to a tiny risk. Aside: My personal opinion
is that the LNT is scientifically unsupportable and should be replaced
with a much better model. We deserve far less onerous regulations; there
is evidence that existing regulations actually cause harm. I hear a
rumor that there is a group of mostly retired, but solidly credentialed
professionals who are organizing a special session at the annual ANS
meeting to talk about effective ways to influence policy changes. End
Aside. Most of us recognize that there is no such thing as a zero risk;
repeated assertions of "there is no safe level" should be addressed by
accepting "close enough" to zero so that even the most fearful person
can stop worrying. [The sky has not fallen, even though we have
experienced complete core meltdowns and]{.underline} secondary
[explosions that did some]{.underline} visible [damage]{.underline}.
Nuclear plants are not perfect, there will be accidents and there will
be radioactive material releases. [History is telling me that the risks
are acceptable]{.underline}, especially in the context of the real world
where there is always some potential for harm. The benefits of accepting
a little nuclear risk are immense and must not be marginalized by the
people who market fear and trembling.

"Doubting Deterrence of Nuclear Terrorism,"
http://csis.org/blog/doubting-deterrence-nuclear-terrorism\]

Because of the difficulty of deterring transnational actors, many
deterrence advocates shift the focus to deterring state sponsors of
nuclear terrorism. The argument applies whether or not the state
intended to assist nuclear terrorists. If terrorists obtain a nuclear
weapon or fissile materials from a state, [the theory goes, then the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will track the weapon's
country of origin using nuclear forensics, and retaliate against that
country]{.underline}. If this is U.S. policy, advocates predict that
[states will be deterred from assisting terrorists with their nuclear
ambitions]{.underline}. Yet, [let's think about the series of events
that would play out if a terrorist organization detonated a weapon in
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Let's assume forensics
confirmed the weapon's origin,]{.underline} and let's assume, for
argument's sake, that country was Pakistan. [Would the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [then retaliate with a nuclear
strike?]{.underline} If a nuclear attack occurs within the next four
years (a reasonable length of time for such predictions concerning
current international and domestic politics), **[it seems unlikely.
Why?]{.underline}** First, [there's the problem of time.]{.underline}
[Though nuclear forensics is useful, it takes time to analyze the data
and determine the country of origin. Any justified response upon a state
sponsor would not be swift.]{.underline} Second, [**even if** the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [proved the country of origin,
it would then be difficult to determine that Pakistan willingly and
intentionally sponsored nuclear terrorism.]{.underline} If Pakistan did,
then nuclear retaliation might be justified. However, [if Pakistan did
not, nuclear retaliation over unsecured nuclear materials would be a
disproportionate response and]{.underline} potentially [further
detrimental]{.underline}. Should the United States launch a nuclear
strike at Pakistan, Islamabad could see this as an initial hostility by
the United States, and respond adversely. An obvious choice, given
current tensions in South Asia, is for Pakistan to retaliate against a
U.S. nuclear launch on its territory by initiating conflict with India,
which could turn nuclear and increase the exchanges of nuclear weapons.
Hence, [it seems more likely that, after the international outrage at a
terrorist group's nuclear detonation, the United States would attempt to
stop the bleeding **without a nuclear strike**]{.underline}. Instead,
[some choices might include deploying forces to track down those that
supported the suicide terrorists that detonated the weapon, pressuring
Pakistan to exert its sovereignty over fringe regions such as the
F]{.underline}ederally [A]{.underline}dministered [T]{.underline}ribal
[A]{.underline}reas, [and increasing the number of drone strikes in
Waziristan. Given the initial attack, such measures might understandably
seem more of a concession than the retaliation called for by deterrence
models, even more so by the American public]{.underline}. This is not an
argument against those technologies associated with nuclear forensics.
The United States and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should
continue their development and distribution. Instead, I [question the
presumed American response that is promulgated by deterrence
advocates]{.underline}. By [looking at possibilities for a U.S. response
to nuclear terrorism, a situation in which we assume that deterrence has
failed, we **cast doubt on the likelihood of a U.S. retaliatory nuclear
strike** and hence cast doubt on the credibility of a U.S. retaliatory
nuclear strike as a deterrent]{.underline}. Would the United States
launch a nuclear weapon now unless it was sure of another state's
intentional sponsorship of nuclear terrorism? **[Any reasonable
doubt]{.underline}** of sponsorship [might stay the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [nuclear hand. Given the opaqueness of countries'
intentions, reasonable doubt over sponsorship **is inevitable** to some
degree. Other countries are probably **aware of U.S.
hesitance**]{.underline} in response to terrorists' use of nuclear
weapons. If this thought experiment is true, then the communication
required for credible retaliatory strikes under deterrence of nuclear
terrorism is missing.

However, there is of course no guarantee that things will remain that
way, and the [9/11 attacks inspired the **remarkable extrapolation**
that, because the **terrorists were successful with box cutters**, they
might soon be able to **turn out** **w**eapons of **m**ass
**d**estruction--- particularly **nuclear ones**]{.underline}---[and
then detonate them]{.underline} in an American city. For example, in his
influential 2004 book, Nuclear Terrorism, Harvard's Graham [**Allison**
relayed his "considered judgment" that "on the current path, a nuclear
terrorist attack on America in the decade ahead is more likely than
not.]{.underline}"11 Allison has had a great deal of company in his
alarming pronouncements. In 2007, the distinguished physicist Richard
Garwin put the likelihood of a nuclear explosion on an American or
European city by terrorist or other means at 20 percent per year, which
would work out to 91 percent over the eleven-year period to 2018.12
**[Allison's time is up]{.underline}**, and so is Garwin's. These
[**off-repeated warnings** have **proven** to be **empty**]{.underline}.
And it is important to point out that [**not only** have terrorists
**failed to go nuclear**]{.underline}, but as William Langewiesche, who
has assessed the process in detail, put it in 2007, "[The best
information is that **no one has gotten anywhere near
this**]{.underline}. I mean, if [you look carefully and practically at
this process, you see that it is an **enormous undertaking** **full of
risks for** the would-be **terrorists**]{.underline}."13 [That process
requires **trusting corrupted** foreign **collaborators** and **other
criminals**, **obtaining** and **transporting** **highly guarded
material**, setting up a **machine shop** staffed with **top scientists
and technicians**, and rolling the **heavy**, **cumbersome**, and
**untested** finished **product** into position to be **detonated** by a
**skilled crew**, all the while **attracting no attention** from
outsiders]{.underline}. [Nor have terrorist groups been able to steal
existing nuclear weapons---characteristically burdened with **multiple
safety devices** and often **stored in pieces** at **separate secure
locales**]{.underline}---from existing arsenals as was once much feared.
And [they certainly **have not been able** to **cajole leaders** in
nuclear states to palm one off to them]{.underline}---though a war
inflicting more death than Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined was launched
against Iraq in 2003 in major part under the spell of fantasies about
such a handover.14 More generally, [the actual terrorist "adversaries"
in the West scarcely deserve accolades for either dedication or
prowess]{.underline}. It is true, of course, that sometimes even
incompetents can get lucky, but such instances, however tragic, are
rare. [For the most part, terrorists in the United States are a
**confused**, **inadequate**, **incompetent**, **blundering**, and
**gullible bunch**, only **occasionally able to get their act
together**]{.underline}. [Most seem to be far **better** at frenetic and
often **self-deluded scheming** than at actual
**execution**]{.underline}. A summary assessment by RAND's Brian Jenkins
is apt: "[their numbers remain small, their determination limp, and
their competence poor]{.underline}."15 And much [the same holds for
Europe and the rest of the developed world]{.underline}.16 Also working
against terrorist success in the West is the fact that almost all are
amateurs: [they have never before tried to do something like
this]{.underline}. Unlike criminals they have not been able to develop
street smarts. Except perhaps for the use of vehicles to deliver mayhem
(though this idea is by no means new in the history of terrorism),
[there has been remarkably **little innovation** in **terrorist
weaponry** or methodology since 9/11]{.underline}.17 Like their
predecessors, [they have continue]{.underline}d [to rely on
**bombs**]{.underline} ([many of which **fail to detonate**]{.underline}
or do much damage) [and bullets]{.underline}.18

### 1NC \-\-- Iran Answers

#### No US-Iran war -- [mutual disincentives]{.underline} and [empirics]{.underline} -- rhetoric doesn't matter. 

**Tabatabai '17** (Adnan Tabatabai is co-founder and CEO of the Center
for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient, "Why Iran-US war of
words won\'t turn physical", Al-Monitor, February 9, 2017,
<http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/iran-us-war-words-trump-escalating-rhetoric.html>,
accessed 6/29/2017,)

As much as the United States\' new tone toward Iran is worrisome, and as
much as the Islamic Republic\'s Jan. 29 ballistic missile test is
disconcerting, **[Tehran and Washington are unlikely to
collide]{.underline}** directly. [In both capitals, decision-makers see
an urgent need for harsh rhetoric]{.underline} --- albeit for different
reasons. [The Iranians see a need to show resilience vis-a-vis an
explicitly hostile US administration]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the
latter wants to make clear to both its domestic and international
audience that the Obama era is over]{.underline}. This involves
signaling that the easing of tensions with Iran has ended. It also
involves reassuring regional allies such as Saudi Arabia and Israel that
Washington would not engage in a rapprochement with Tehran at their
expense. Indeed, it should not come as a surprise that US national
security adviser Michael Flynn\'s warning that Iran \"is officially on
notice\" came shortly after lengthy phone calls between the White House
and both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia\'s
King Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. [**But escalating rhetoric aside,
the reality is that US policy toward Iran has largely remained intact.**
In the 13 months since the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran has repeatedly conducted ballistic missile
tests.]{.underline} And it is entitled to do so. In UN Security Council
Resolution (UNSCR) 2231, which endorses the nuclear deal, Iran is
\"called upon\" not to carry out tests of missiles \"designed\" to carry
nuclear weapons. There is no legally binding prohibition of such
launches, unlike in UNSCR 1929 --- the last and most harsh UN resolution
against Iran over its nuclear program --- which is superseded by UNSCR
2231. [To be clear, the nuclear deal does not address Iran\'s missile
program. Moreover, the world powers with which Iran negotiated UNSCR
2231 --- apart from the United States --- did not display any appetite
to insert legally binding text on Iran\'s missile tests]{.underline}.
Thus, [as provocative as the missile tests may be, it is hard to see
them providing a legal basis for the United States to spearhead new
multilateral sanctions]{.underline}, leaving Washington with the option
of adopting unilateral sanctions, which it did on Feb. 3. While it took
the Trump administration less than two weeks to slap sanctions on Iran,
the idea that there was a sanctions freeze in Obama\'s final year in
office is inaccurate. In fact, the latest sanctions were prepared by the
previous administration. In January 2016, not long after the
implementation of the nuclear deal, changes were made to the Visa Waiver
Program, which excluded Iranian dual nationals and anyone who had
visited Iran in the preceding five years. Moreover, last December, Obama
refrained from moving to veto the congressional vote on a 10-year
extension of the Iran Sanctions Act. While these sanctions are unrelated
to Iran\'s nuclear program, they undoubtedly undermine the impact of the
lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. [Iran has reacted to the
escalating rhetoric and sanctions by stressing that its missile program
is defensive in nature, promising retaliatory sanctions, and by carrying
out new military drills. **Yet, there is little incentive for Iran to
greatly alter the status quo**. Iranian leaders see the JCPOA as much
more than just about the United States]{.underline}. It is an
international arrangement with world powers --- including the European
Union, which Iran holds in high regard as a multinational institution.
[They see this arrangement as beneficial to Iran\'s economic and
security calculations]{.underline}. Foreign investment, albeit limited
due to remaining US sanctions, is trickling in. The EU oil embargo has
been lifted and major contracts in the area of petrochemicals, civic
aviation and transport are increasingly sealed. Additionally, [the JCPOA
provides a sense of security to Iran]{.underline}. It is highly unlikely
for any party to the agreement to green-light military action by another
party against Iran. Hence, [Iran has little incentive not to abide by
the nuclear deal.]{.underline} [**As such, while the cycle of escalating
rhetoric is discomforting at a time of deep uncertainty and conflict in
the Middle East, it is important to see that it has its limits. Short of
outright regime change, the United States has in fact rather limited
options to weaken and contain Iran.** Given its experiences in places
like Iraq and Afghanistan, it is unlikely that the United States will
launch full-scale unilateral military action against Iran]{.underline}.
It could move to arm a third country to hit Iranian infrastructure. This
was tried with Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Today, Saudi Arabia could be
such a third country. But given the lack of appetite in Riyadh for
direct confrontation with Tehran, and considering the downward spiral in
the Saudi military intervention against Yemen --- the poorest country in
the region --- it is unthinkable that Saudi Arabia would take such a
step. [Israel has repeatedly threatened to attack Iranian nuclear sites.
But considering the low chances of success and the potentially dire
consequences, including retaliatory attacks by Lebanon\'s Hezbollah
movement, it can be argued that such threats primarily serve a political
purpose]{.underline}. Less costly measures aimed at weakening and
containing Iran, such as sanctions, have been tried and tested. The
Obama administration managed to put in place an unprecedented
multilateral sanctions regime targeting Tehran. Yet, it was under those
very sanctions that Iran's nuclear program evolved into what the
international community came to perceive as a major threat to global
security. Consequently, [the Obama administration tried diplomacy. And
it worked. The JCPOA reduced the capacity and increased the transparency
of Iran\'s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of
nuclear-related sanctions]{.underline}. And as the International Atomic
Energy Agency has repeatedly certified, the deal is working. Bearing in
mind the nuclear deal is fulfilling its objectives, the limited military
options to contain Iran, and perhaps most of all the likely US inability
to forge an international consensus against Iran in case of its
unilateral breach of the accord, the security establishments of both
Israel and Saudi Arabia have publicly urged Washington not to dismantle
the JCPOA. While reveling in the newfound reassurances from Washington,
it can thus be argued that Riyadh and Tel Aviv understand the limits of
the cycle of escalation and mostly take solace in Trump\'s unwillingness
to realize their nightmares under Obama. In this vein, the Trump
administration can be expected to do whatever it can to minimize the
economic benefits Iran will reap under the JCPOA. It will likely seek to
discredit Iran\'s regional policies to prevent the normalization of the
Islamic Republic\'s ties with the world, while also diminishing the
political capital the deal affords Iran. But it will do this short of
breaching the accord. **[Thus, while likely to squabble about respective
obligations and further drift away from rapprochement, neither Iran nor
the United States has the incentive or ability to take the new cycle of
tension to a military confrontation.]{.underline}**

To accurately gauge the strategic challenges from Iran over a ten- to
fifteen-year horizon, [this study sought to assess the motivations of
the Islamic Republic, not just its capabilities.]{.underline} **[This
approach]{.underline}**, although difficult given the complexities of
the Iranian system, **[is critical in identifying potential sources of
caution and pragmatism in Iran's policy]{.underline} formulation**. [Our
exploration of Iranian strategic thinking revealed that **ideology and
bravado frequently mask a preference for opportunism and
realpolitik**---the qualities that define "normal" state
behavior.]{.underline} Similarly, when we canvassed Iran's power
projection options, we identified not only the extent of the threats
posed by each but also their limitations and liabilities. In each case,
[we found significant barriers and buffers to Iran's strategic reach
rooted in both the regional geopolitics it is trying to influence and in
its limited conventional military capacity, diplomatic isolation, and
past strategic missteps]{.underline}. Similarly, [tensions between the
regime and Iranian society]{.underline}---segments of which have grown
disenchanted with the Republic's revolutionary ideals---[can also act as
a constraint on Iranian external behavior.]{.underline} ¶ This leads to
our conclusion that [analogies to the Cold War are mistaken: The Islamic
Republic does not seek territorial aggrandizement]{.underline} [or even,
despite its rhetoric, the forcible imposition of its revolutionary
ideology onto neighboring states. Instead]{.underline}, it feeds off
existing grievances with the status quo, particularly in the Arab world.
Traditional containment options may actually create further
opportunities for Tehran to exploit, thereby amplifying the very
influence the United States is trying to mitigate. A more useful
strategy, therefore, is one that exploits [existing checks on Iran's
power and influence]{.underline}. These [include the gap between its
aspiration for asymmetric warfare]{.underline} [capabilities and the
reality of its]{.underline} rather [**limited conventional forces**,
disagreements between Iran and its militant "proxies," and the potential
for sharp criticism from Arab public opinion, which it has long sought
to exploit]{.underline}. In addition, we recommend a new U.S. approach
to Iran that integrates elements of engagement and containment while
de-escalating unilateral U.S. pressure on Tehran and applying increased
multilateral pressure against its nuclear ambitions. The analyses that
informed these conclusions also yielded the following insights for U.S.
planners and strategists concerning Iran's strategic culture,
conventional military, ties to Islamist groups, and ability to influence
Arab public opinion.

#### NATO cohesion does not provide any practical benefits.

**Carpenter 22** --- Ted Galen Carpenter, Senior Fellow for defense and
foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, PhD in U.S. diplomatic
history from the University of Texas, 2022 ("NATO Security Dependents
Are Not Useful Allies," *CATO,* January 8^th^, Available Online at
<https://www.cato.org/commentary/nato-security-dependents-are-not-useful-allies>)

SINCE THE end of World War II, [U.S. officials have had an **unduly
expansive** concept of what constitutes worthwhile strategic allies for
the United States. In too many cases, the "allies" that Washington touts
are **small**, **weak**, often **militarily useless**
dependents]{.underline}. [Worse, some of them are on bad terms with more
**powerful neighboring states**]{.underline}. Under those
circumstances[, the so‐​called allies are **major liabilities** rather
than assets to the United States]{.underline}. Indeed, [they are
potential snares, ones that can **entangle America** in unnecessary
military confrontations]{.underline}.

Washington would do well to become far more selective about which
nations it includes in its roster of allies, and U[.S. leaders should
stop elevating security dependents to the status of allies]{.underline}.
When U.S. officials described the regimes that Washington installed
through military force in Afghanistan and Iraq as allies, it became
clear that they had lost even minimal understanding of the concept. That
point became abundantly evident when their Afghan client collapsed
almost overnight in the face of the Taliban military offensive. It's
time for U.S. policymakers to do better.

[TROUBLING PROMISCUITY about acquiring weak U.S. security partners was
evident even during the Cold War, and the tendency has become **even
more pronounced** in the post‐​Cold War era]{.underline}. As the fiasco
in Afghanistan (and its ugly predecessor in South Vietnam) confirmed,
that problem with U.S. foreign policy has existed in multiple regions.
However, the defect has become most acute with respect to Washington's
campaign to expand NATO into Eastern Europe. Since the mid‐​1990s, [U.S.
administrations have worked to add a menagerie of new NATO members, and
it has done so with even less selectivity and good judgment than some
people use to acquire Facebook friends]{.underline}.

[Many of those new members have **very little to offer** to the United
States as security partners. Indeed, some are mini‐​states, bordering on
being micro‐​states. Such lightly armed Lilliputians would add little or
nothing to Washington's own capabilities---especially in a showdown with
another major power.]{.underline}

[As economic assets, their importance is **decidedly limited**, and
militarily, they are **even less valuable**]{.underline}. [It's **hard
to see** how new NATO allies such as Albania, Slovenia, Montenegro, and
North Macedonia enhance America's **power** and
**security**]{.underline}. That point should be apparent based on size
of population alone. Albania's 2.87 million, North Macedonia's 2.1
million, and Slovenia's 2.07 million people put those countries squarely
in the mini‐​state category, while Montenegro's 628,000 barely deserves
even that label. It doesn't get much better with respect to either
annual gross domestic product or size of military forces. Even
Slovenia's \$52.8 billion GDP puts that country only eighty‐​sixth in the
global rankings. Albania's \$15.2 billion (125th), North Macedonia's
\$12.26 billion (135th) and Montenegro's \$4.78 billion (159th) are even
less impressive.

T[he military forces that our new NATO allies can field are **not
likely** to strike fear into Russia or any other would‐​be
aggresso]{.underline}r. Albania's armed forces consist of 8,500
active‐​duty personnel, Slovenia's consist of 8,500, and North Macedonia
has 9,000 available. [Montenegro's active‐​duty force totals 2,400. In
comparison, the Austin, Texas, police department has 2,422 people in its
ranks.]{.underline}

Granted, the Cold War edition of NATO also had some mini‐​states as
members, most notably Luxembourg and Iceland. However, those members
were located within a stable, democratic Western Europe. Their defense
also was geographically inseparable from Washington's mission of
protecting important military and economic players, such as West
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Great Britain, from what appeared to
be a totalitarian superpower with expansionist ambitions[. That
situation was qualitatively different from Washington's gratuitous
post‐​Cold War decision to manage the security of quarrelsome mini‐​states
in the chronically volatile Balkans]{.underline}. Since the mid‐​1990s,
the United States has entangled itself in the region's parochial spats,
but giving some of the countries NATO membership intensified America's
exposure to needless risks and burdens.

[THE RISK-BENEFIT calculation is **even worse** with respect to some of
the other small nations that have joined NATO in the post‐​Cold War era.
Those partners are not merely irrelevant from the standpoint of U.S.
security; they are potentially dangerous tripwires that could trigger a
conflict between the United States and a nuclear‐​armed
Russia.]{.underline}

That point underscores one very important difference between individuals
casually amassing Facebook friends and the United States promiscuously
adding new security mendicants. [Facebook friends do not have the
ability to entangle anyone in armed conflicts; irresponsible security
dependents definitely can do so. Indeed, there are multiple examples
throughout history of such clients snaring their patrons into
devastating, unnecessary wars]{.underline}. One notable example was how
Tsarist Russia's fateful decision to give strong backing to Serbia in
the latter's escalating quarrel with Austria‐​Hungary following the
assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand helped ignite World War
I---and caused the utter ruin of the Russian empire.

[The United States is flirting with a similar danger today regarding its
small clients in Eastern Europe. President George W. Bush's decision to
support the NATO membership bids of the three Baltic republics was---and
remains---highly provocative to Russia.]{.underline} One crucial way to
reduce the danger of armed clashes between great powers is to show
mutual respect for respective spheres of influence. Washington has
repeatedly violated that principle by pushing NATO to expand right up to
Russia's border.

Before President Donald Trump attempts real diplomacy with Russian
President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki on July 16, he\'ll
first be subjected to another summit. That first summit is a gathering
of leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}). These leaders continually [assure the United
States they are America\'s best allies, even as most contribute little
to America\'s defense and rack up huge trade surpluses with the United
States]{.underline}. [Trump]{.underline} will insist on a better deal
but [should go farther and wind down U.S. membership in
NATO]{.underline}. After the alliance was established in 1949, its first
secretary general, Lord Hastings Ismay, summed up its purpose concisely:
"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down." The
unofficial mission matched the time well: Western Europe's postwar
future was clouded by the prospect of a Soviet invasion, American
insularity, or German militarism--- all possible given the preceding
decades of history. Nearly seventy years later, none of these concerns
still exist. Furthermore, NATO\'s opposing alliance during the Cold War,
the Warsaw Pact, quit the Soviet Bloc in 1989, and the Soviet Union
itself passed into history in 1991 ---twenty-seven years ago. Despite
endless searches for a new mission to justify its massive burden on U.S.
taxpayers, [**NATO has failed** to be of much]{.underline} use since
then. As its boosters like to remind us, after 9/11, the alliance
invoked its Article 5 mutual-defense provision on our behalf. But action
from America's allies did not follow the grandiose gesture---[the NATO
mission in Afghanistan relied mostly on U.S. forces and effectively
failed.]{.underline} Today, the alliance's bureaucrats and some [member
states spotlight a threat from Russia as a reason for keeping the
organization alive]{.underline}, along with a laundry list of "train and
equip" missions. Yet [NATO members\' defense budgets don\'t reflect a
real sense of danger from Russia or anyone else]{.underline}. Among the
twenty-nine members, [only the United States is really serious about its
Article 3 obligations to defend itself]{.underline}, spending
approximately \$700 billion or 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense. [No
other NATO member comes close]{.underline} to this proportion, and the
[vast majority fail even to meet the modest, self-imposed requirement to
devote at least 2 percent of GDP to defense]{.underline}. Britain and
Poland are rare members that meet the 2 percent requirement. One of the
worst free-riders is Canada, which spends just 1 percent of its GDP on
security, amounting to \$20 billion. Furthermore, Germany spends a
similarly pathetic 1.2 percent. Compare that to non-NATO members facing
real threats, some of which spend 5-10 percent of their GDPs on defense.
These include Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who must
contend with Iran and spend nearly a combined \$100 billion. Israel,
which faces the same enemy, adds \$15 billion to the equation. Despite
protestations of poverty at a time when their economies have never been
larger, NATO members are more than willing to rack up additional
liabilities, knowing America has their back. Last year, the alliance
welcomed Montenegro. It is now poised to admit the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, which would mean the United States is pledged to
defend a nation that devotes just \$120 million per year to its own
defense, not quite as much as the Cincinnati Police Department. But the
reality is [there is no truly capable Russian foe seriously threatening
the West]{.underline}. Russia has one million uniformed personnel in its
military, the world's second-largest behind America, but the European
Union could easily afford to match that with its combined \$17 trillion
economy---ten times larger than Russia's. However, it needn't bother as
[Moscow spends just \$61 billion on its overwrought
military]{.underline}, which doubles as an employment program. Russia's
Vladimir Putin has gotten the most from Russia's military, occupying
parts of Georgia and Ukraine and gaining influence in Syria by backing
the Assad regime. Still, his success in all three cases rested heavily
on surprises that Moscow seems unlikely to be able to repeat against
prepared and adequately funded European militaries. Yer we should expect
to hear none of this nuance at the NATO summit, as poohbahs of the dying
old European political order gather to tut-tut President Trump in the
alliance's fancy new \$1.4 billion headquarters, funded predominantly by
American taxpayers. To get out of this abusive relationship, Trump
should begin the process of limiting America\'s role in NATO. A [good
model is that of Sweden, which cooperates with NATO on some matters and
not on others. Such an approach could allow joint training, but end the
practice of having overburdened U.S. taxpayers foot the bill for wealthy
Europeans\' security]{.underline}. As part of this plan, [Trump could
mothball U.S. bases in Europe and shift most resources spent there and
in the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific region, where China and Iran pose
real threats to America---and against which **NATO is
irrelevant**]{.underline}. Europe is prosperous and treats America like
a patsy. Let it stand on its own.

such as Ukraine and Belarus. It is probable that **[Western Europe could
rescue its commitment to collective institutions]{.underline}**,
including collective defense, but it is unlikely that it could extend
security guarantees far eastwards, as NATO today is able to. A revised
bargain with Russia will then become necessary, one in which the
sovereignty of Eastern European countries will be questioned.

https://www.thenation.com/article/the-transatlantic-alliance-will-survive-trump/

Every week, [often more than once a week, there's a]{.underline}nother
[article in the major media]{.underline} or in
foreign-policypublications [about the demise of the]{.underline}
post--World War II Anglo-American world order. These analyses typically
single out the [transatlantic alliance]{.underline} between the United
States and Europe―two of the world's largest economies―for special
concern and anxiety as the underpinning of this world order. Not
surprisingly, President [Trump's]{.underline} wildly fluctuating
[comments on NATO]{.underline} (despite the fact that he is expanding
it), [his unprecedented **rudeness to Europe**an leaders, and his
**friendliness with**]{.underline} Vladimir [**Putin** at]{.underline}
the [Helsinki]{.underline} summit have [all added to the
angst]{.underline}. The basic story behind this moaning and melancholy
is that US leaders put together a "rules-based" system based on "open
markets" and democracy (the two are sometimes seen as synonymous) that
has fostered prosperity and relative stability. The United States was
the only sizable industrial economy to emerge not only unscathed but
doubled in size following the war. While others might have taken
advantage of this unrivaled power for their own gain, the story goes,
America's beneficent rulers constructed a world order for the good of
everyone. Trump is seen as a threat to its continued existence. This
assessment of the postwar world order leaves out some 3 million dead
Vietnamese and half a million dead in Indonesia, who might question the
beneficence of this system if it had not killed them. A million dead
Iraqis, if they could be heard, would probably also raise objections
about whether US dominance has been in the interests of all. And there
are hundreds of millions of people in Latin America, Africa, and other
parts of Asia who suffered for decades under US-backed dictatorships, as
well as US-sponsored wars. Much of the violent dysfunctionality in these
countries today is a direct result of these interventions, as well as
continuing US influence. In fact, as I write this now, the US military
is directly involved in a war that has deliberately produced what the UN
has called the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, in Yemen. That
war has pushed more than 8 million peopleto the brink of starvation,
created the worst outbreak of cholera in modern history, and killed
thousands of civilians in bombing raids. Washington is providing midair
refueling to the Saudi and UAE bombers, intelligence, targeting
assistance, on-the-ground military personnel, and more―constrained only
by growing opposition in Congress. But let us ignore these inconvenient
truths for a moment, as almost all of these analyses do, and look at the
present situation. [In fact, the transatlantic **alliance is much
stronger** than most of these analysts recognize]{.underline}. This is
mainly because it is not just an alliance of democratic governments with
shared values, but also one of the rich countries of the world―their
ruling elites, that is―against the poor and middle-income countries of
the world. [The rules of the **W**orld **T**rade
**O**rganization]{.underline}, to which 164 countries are bound, [were
written by US and European corporations]{.underline}. The WTO's most
significant achievement since its creation in 1995 was to increase
US-style patent protection throughout the world, leading to the death of
millions of poor people who cannot get access to essential medicines.
After years of struggle, some of these rules were rewritten, but much
damage remains. The WTO's rules on agriculture also greatly disadvantage
developing countries and seek to prohibit governments from subsidizing
domestic production for domestic consumption to feed people who are
badly malnourished, for example in India. WTO rules also make it much
more difficult for developing countries to employ the industrial
policies that high-income countries like the United States used to get
where they are today. [The **I**nternational **M**onetary
**F**und,]{.underline} an organization that has 189 member countries,
[is run by the United States and Europe]{.underline}. In fact, for most
of the world outside of Europe, the US Treasury Department is in charge.
The World Bank, which by custom since 1946 has to have an American as
its president, is also controlled by Washington and its allies, and
cooperates with the IMF in promoting and imposing economic policies that
Washington favors. These policies are often not in the interest of
developing countries, as one would expect from organizations that are
not accountable to low- and middle-income countries, or to any
electorate. [These are the institutions of global governance that
exercise power in the world]{.underline}, other than the
**[UN]{.underline}** Security Council, [where the transatlantic alliance
must share **veto power** with **Russia and China**.]{.underline} The
IMF, for most of the past half-century, has been the most important
avenue of US influence over low- and middle-income countries. It has sat
at the top of a creditors' cartel, where countries that did not agree to
IMF conditions would not get loans from other multilateral lenders
(e.g., the World Bank) and sometimes not even from the private sector.
This cartel lost influence in most middle-income countries in the first
decade of the 21st century, but it has been coming back (e.g.,
inArgentina), and it still maintains its creditors' cartel in poor
countries. [European leaders are quite angry about]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration['s unilateral abrogation of the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action]{.underline}, the negotiated agreement with
[Iran]{.underline} that had put an end to the threat that it would
develop nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future. Europe clearly has
much more of a security risk stemming from Middle East turmoil, which is
worsened by Trump's threatened war with Iran; not to mention all the
political problems that have been created by the refugee inflow that was
primarily a result of US intervention there. [**But what did they do**
about it, after their anxious pleading with Trump failed to move him?
**Nothing**, because these leaders―quite apart from the people of
Europe, who have been screwed royally since the Great Recession―need
their beloved partner in crime]{.underline}. The United States is the
gendarme of the rich countries' global economic and political order.
This is partly because Washington did not suffer the destruction that
Europe did in the world wars, and partly because Europeans have
developed welfare states that do not allow for the fantastically
wasteful military spending that maintains 800 US military bases around
the globe. But Washington's weapons of mass and ordinary destruction are
by no means its whole arsenal. The "exorbitant privilege" of being able
to print the world's most important currency, which makes up 60 percent
of global reserves held by central banks, is another. [When Lehman
Brothers collapsed in 2008 and the world financial crisis hit, the
Federal Reserve arranged currency swaps for its European partners to
make sure they didn't suffer any temporary international liquidity
problems. On the other side of the divide, if you are outside
Washington's good graces, the **dollarized** world financial **system**
allows the United States vast power to enforce **sanctions** against you
(e.g., in the cases of Cuba, Venezuela, and Iran), whether or not the UN
approves]{.underline}. [Europe's elites are **bound** to the rulers of
the **U**nited **S**tates by virtue of their **common interest** in
maintaining dominance over the world **economy**. This is true despite
the fact that their spoils do not trickle down to the
citizenry]{.underline}. This transatlantic dominance won't last forever.
Eurasia, the world's largest land mass, which bred the colonial powers
that conquered the world, continues to increase its economic
integration, despite Washington's efforts to counter this
world-historical trend with its attempted TPP and TTIP commercial
agreements. China's economy is already 25 percent larger than that of
the United States on a purchasing-power-parity basis (this is the
measure most often used by economists for international comparisons,
since it takes into account price differences between countries). In a
decade, it's projected to be about twice as big as that of the United
States. Over time, European countries, led by their corporations and
financial institutions, will look more to the East and less to the West
as the world becomes more multipolar and the US share of the world
economy shrinks. But [for the near future, the **US and Europe**an elite
**need each other**]{.underline} as the global hegemon tries to hang on
to its unelected position. [Trump can be as rude, crude, and ignorant as
he pleases with his European allies, but **it won't make them rebel**
against the "leader of the free world."]{.underline}

Peace Idea," *Rethinking the Value of Democracy: A Comparative
Perspective*, Edited by Jean-Paul Gagnon and Mark Chou, Published by
Palgrave Macmillan, ISBN 9783319916569, p. 98-99)

My chapter, though, did not look for specifc studies which could support
one specifc argument (e.g. 'democracy is a good thing' or 'democracy has
instrumental value as it brings peace between states'). [The aim of the
chapter was to investigate the question whether democracy leads to
interstate war or peace, by analysing **dozens** of statistical studies
which have been selected in a systematic way. The analyses revealed many
caveats.]{.underline}

[The first caveat is that **none** of the studies which have directly
tested the democratic peace hypothesis demonstrated that democracy is
the only and most important factor when explaining interstate war.
Some]{.underline} studies [provided evidence that other factors are
significant as well, and other studies indicated that alternative
explanations are much more powerful, sometimes even showing that the
impact of democracy is simply spurious. Geographical and economic
factors, for example, play a key role as well, and tend to be far more
important, so it is certainly not only democracy which
matters.]{.underline}

[Secondly, these findings are based on quantitative
studies,]{.underline} **[which show correlation but not necessarily
causation]{.underline}**. While there is a lively ongoing debate about
the causal mechanisms, it is still unclear how we can understand and
interpret the expected absence of interstate war between democracies.
[The number of studies which criticize these ideas has increased
considerably]{.underline} since the mid-1990s, [not just theoretically
but particularly empirically as there is no strong evidence to back up
the ideas that norms and institutional constraints are the key
mechanisms]{.underline} (see Hayes 2011). [Moreover, the quest to find
the underlying mechanisms should not get priority anyway in future
research]{.underline}, in my view, [as the statistical evidence for the
democratic peace hypotheses is weak overall]{.underline} (see frst
caveat above).

[Thirdly, democracies are not more peaceful than
dictatorships.]{.underline} While there might be some evidence for
democratic peace among democratic states (or at least a correlation),
[democracies are not more peaceful in general. The evidence for a
monadic link is not clear, not signifcant and certainly not robust.
There is no clear support for the monadic peace hypothesis which states
that interstate war is less likely in democracies compared to
dictatorships in general. And democracies do fight with
dictatorships---**quite a lot**.]{.underline}

[Finally, 'democratizing for peace' seems a dangerous route to take, as
democratizing states fight most---more than both democracies and
dictatorships]{.underline}. Democracies might not fght with each other,
but the [countries that are democratizing are quite
**war-prone**]{.underline}. Moreover, [there is convincing evidence that
hybrid systems (or semi-democracies) are more likely to be involved in
interstate wars, not only compared to countries with higher levels of
democracy but also to countries with lower levels of
democracy.]{.underline} Democratization can be a very unpredictable and
possibly dangerous process, and the fndings in this chapter show that
[democratizing for peace is likely to end in a deadly
disaster.]{.underline}

Based on those fndings, this chapter comes to the controversial
conclusion that eventually [we cannot defend the notion that it really
matters whether you live in a dictatorship or democracy, at least not
with regard to the likelihood that an interstate war will take place in
your country]{.underline}. In other words, **[democracy is not a panacea
for peace in general, and we cannot be sure that people living in
democracies have less chance to experience an interstate
war]{.underline}** compared to people living in dictatorships. [People
living in democratizing and hybrid systems seem to be most at risk,
which means promoting democratization would not be wise, at least not
when achieving peace is the ultimate goal. Hence, war is most likely in
democratizing countries]{.underline}. Still, the chance of an interstate
war is low in the other political systems---so not only in democracies
but in dictatorships as well. In this sense, the idea that democracies
make a signifcant difference is not convincing.43 The (instrumental)
value of democracy cannot be found in being less war-prone and bringing
peace between countries.

Caveat 1: It's Not (Just) Democracy

[While analyzing the selected articles, the first remarkable finding is
that only a relatively small number of studies have actually tested the
democratic peace hypothesis. Most of the studies have focused on the
mechanisms]{.underline} (see next section, caveat 2), [and hence seem to
assume that there is a correlation between democracy and war. In this
way, the majority of the studies---often unintentionally---reinforce the
idea that democratic peace actually exists without testing this
proposition.]{.underline} However, [none of the studies that directly
test the democratic peace hypothesis found strong evidence that
democracy is the most important factor when explaining interstate war.
All democratic peace studies have controlled for many possible
alternative causes of the peace, such as economic development and
growth, geographic distance and contiguity, power status, alliance ties,
militarization and political stability. The findings show that **it is
not just democracy which explains war, not at all**.]{.underline} Within
this group of studies, which explicitly test the democratic peace
hypothesis, four different types of fndings can be detected. I will
discuss those results more in-depth in the rest of this section.

[First Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are
Signifcant Too]{.underline}

[The first subgroup consists of scholars who stress the importance of
democratic peace, despite the fact their own analyses have shown that
other factors are statistically signifcant as well]{.underline} (Maoz
and Russett 1993; Rousseau et al. 1996; Gleditsch and Hegre 1997; Beck
et al. 1998; Ray 2013). [For example, some studies]{.underline} (e.g.
Rousseau et al. 1996) [included alternative independent variables in
order to test realist arguments]{.underline}. They tested whether the
distribution of power determines decisions to use force, and measures
each state's military capabilities relative to its opponent. A state's
military capability is the average of three elements: number of troops,
military expenditures and military expenditures per soldier. They found
that this realist variable was strong, positive and statistically
signifcant at the 0.001 level in their analyses (see, e.g., Rousseau et
al. 1996: 522, Table 2). However, [not only a state's military
capabilities appeared to be an important explanation for peace. In
addition, wealth, growth, alliances and contiguity played a crucial role
when explaining interstate war]{.underline} (see, e.g., Maoz and Russett
1993: 632, Table 1).11 [Moreover, when other factors are included, the
impact of democracy on the likelihood of international crises is even
spurious]{.underline} (Maoz and Russett 1993: 632; Henderson 2002: 141,
see also p. 3).12 [Still, scholars in this group keep defending the
democratic peace idea, despite the fact that their own analyses showed
the signifcance of alternative explanations.]{.underline}

[Second Result: Initially There Is Correlation, but the Impact of
Democracy Is Spurious When Other Explanatory Factors Are Included in the
Models]{.underline}

[The second subgroup of scholars is far more radical. Based on their own
analyses, this group concludes that the democratic peace link is a
spurious one]{.underline} (Weede 1984, 1996; Barbieri 1996; Mousseau
2013; Gartzke and Weisiger 2014).13 Typically, efforts to demonstrate
the spuriousness of the statistical democratic peace pointed to other
factors that, when accounted for 'properly', eliminated or dramatically
reduced the statistical signifcance of shared democracy. Hence, [the
studies in this second group did not find strong evidence for the
democratic peace hypothesis anymore, once other explanatory factors were
included in the models.14]{.underline}

One of the most convincing alternative explanations of peace between
countries is that there is no democratic peace, but a capitalist peace
instead. The settlement in Germany and Japan succeeded because of the
establishment of capitalist peace. Because of economic support by the
Americans, who encouraged free trade and offered trade opportunities in
practice as well, the poorer economies in Europe and Japan would gain
economically, resulting in 'economic growth, prosperity, and,
ultimately, free trade among most of the more technologically advanced
economies' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 232). By establishing and
expanding free trade, the incentives for war would quickly decrease
among trading states, according to this approach. To prevent new
interstate wars after World War II, the capitalist peace was a far more
important factor than the American promotion of democracy and its
political institutions.

The capitalist peace, or capitalist peace theory, also states that
economic development accounts for both democracy and the peace among
democratic nations. Economic development is a key factor to explain
democracy (Lipset 1959; see also Hegre 2003; Weede 2004).15 Moreover,
economic development also plays a role when explaining peace, and the
presence of market-oriented economies in countries have a positive
impact on both democracy in those countries and peace between them
(Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2013; see also Hegre 2014). Democratic
peace only exists when both democracies have high levels of economic
development, when economic development is well above the global median.

In fact, the poorest 21% of the democracies studied, and the poorest
4--5% of current democracies, are signifcantly more likely than other
kinds of political systems to fight each other (see, e.g., Mousseau
2005). Moreover, if at least one of the democracies involved has a very
low level of economic development, then democracy cannot prevent war.16
Still, there is a pacifying effect of free trade and economic
interdependence, which is more important than the effect of democracy,
because the former affects peace both directly and indirectly, by
producing economic development and ultimately, democracy (see Weede
2004).17

[Capitalist peace]{.underline} is not the only alternative explanation.
[Shared interests in general, and political similarities in specifc, can
also be seen as an important second alternative explanation for war and
peace between countries]{.underline} (Farber and Gowa 1995, 1997;
Gartzke 2007; Gowa 1999; Henderson 2002). [Democracies are not peaceful
to each other because they are democratic, but rather because they are
similar. So the difference of the scores of both countries also
contributes to the confict proneness of the dyad. If the difference in
levels of democracy is big, then the chance of confict is
higher]{.underline} (cf. Oneal and Russett 1997: 281--282).

Many researchers have conflated both the conflict-dampening impact of
joined democracy and the confict-exacerbating impact of political
distance in the variables focusing on political systems, but as Errol A.
Henderson (2002: 32) convincingly argued: 'Fusing these two contrasting
attributes in a single variable makes it diffcult to distinguish between
the competing processes'. Therefore, it is better to include an
additional variable of 'political dissimilarity' in the model. Henderson
(2002) was one of the frst scholars who included this variable and
measured it by taking the absolute value of the difference between the
two states' scores. His main variables were not only political
similarity, but also geographic distance and economic interdependence,
and he concluded that democratic peace is a statistical artefact which
disappears when those other variables are taken into account. Political
similarity clearly has a pacifying effect18 (see Werner 2000; Henderson
2002; Beck et al. 2004), and it is not democracy per se which is the
decisive factor.19

Hence, the benefts of trade and trade interdependence are essential
explanations, while democracy is spurious or at least subordinate (see
also Rosecrance 1986; Weede 1984, 1996; Hegre 2000, 2014; Jervis 2002;
Souva 2003; Rasler and Thompson 2005: 235; Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003,
2005). Based on those studies, it is safe to conclude that democracy, on
its own, is an unlikely cause of the democratic peace.

[Third Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are Much
Stronger]{.underline}

[This same point that democracy is just one of the explanations for
peace (and not even a very important one) is also at the core of studies
in the third subgroup. Scholars of this group keep arguing that there is
support for the democratic peace hypothesis, and that the link is not
spurious. In this sense, they are less radical than the second group of
scholars, as they do not completely reject the value of democracy for
peace. On the other hand, their own analyses have clearly shown that
alternative factors---hence other factors than democracy or type of
political system--- are not only statistically signifcant but also more
important when trying to explain interstate war]{.underline} (Bremer
1992; Gelpi 1997; Oneal and Russet t 1999a, b; Reiter and Stam 2002;
Peterson 2013; Caselli et al. 2015).

[Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggest that democracy is
not the most important factor, while war is more likely to occur between
states that are geographically proximate, approximately equal in power,
major powers, allied, economically advanced and highly militarized than
between those that are not]{.underline}. Bivariate analyses of these
factors in relation to the onset of interstate war over all pairs of
states in the period from 1816 to 1965 have generally supported these
associations. However, multivariate analyses revealed some differences.
Stuart Bremer (1992), for example, showed that some factors are far more
important than others. The existence of a dangerous, war-prone dyad can
be best explained by the presence of contiguity, the absence of an
alliance and the absence of more advanced economy. The absence of
democratic polity and other factors (absence of overwhelming
preponderance, and presence of major power) are less powerful. [Overall,
these fndings suggest that our research priorities may be seriously
distorted and that we should not focus too much on the perceived
positive impact of democracy, but on other factors (such as alliances
and economic factors) instead.]{.underline}

[Fourth Result: There Is Correlation, but Only Under Certain Specific
Conditions]{.underline}

[The final subgroup of scholars argues that we cannot unconditionally
accept the idea that democratic peace exists in general, so always and
everywhere. Their statistical studies clearly showed that support for
this hypothesis heavily depends on other factors.]{.underline} The
chance of democratic peace depends not just on the specifc historical
period (Cold War or not; Gibler and Sarkees 2004; Siverson and Emmons
1991; Weede 1984), but also the stage of the confict (beginning,
duration or severity; see Bremer 1993; Bennett and Stam 1996; Reed
2000), and on the neighbourhood instability (extent of confict in the
region; see Gibler and Braithwaite 2013; Gibler and Miller 2013).
Despite the differences between the studies, there is one common finding
in all studies: when explaining interstate war, we cannot just rely on
the impact of democracy, as it is too much dependent on other factors.

[Several scholars found strong evidence for the idea that democratic
peace exists, but only during some **specific historical periods**.
Based on this evidence, they concluded that democratic peace is simply a
statistical artefact of the Cold War]{.underline}. For example, Henry
Farber and Joanne Gowa (1995) found statistical support for the idea
that peace between democracies is an artefact of the Cold War, when the
threat from the communist states forced democracies to ally with one
another (see also Mearsheimer 1990). Sebastian Rosato (2003) also argued
that most of the signifcant evidence for democratic peace has been
observed after World War II; and that it has happened within a broad
alliance, which can be identifed with NATO and its satellite nations,
imposed and maintained by American dominance.

Since the Second World War, war has become a very costly affair.
Scholars discovered that only a handful of states are 'capable of
engaging in major power warfare. That process of elimination has not yet
extinguished the possibility of major power warfare, but it has lowered
its probability immensely' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). The chance
to achieve something in a war is low in general, and even lower in a
bipolar world with two big power players risking high nuclear war costs
(Jervis 2002). While war became more costly, trade became less costly;
as a consequence, the war/trade costs increased during the Cold War
(Rosecrance 1986; see also Jervis 2002). In such a world, war and
confict have become less attractive, while trade and cooperation have
become more appealing (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). Hence, more
states decided to adopt trading strategies in order to prevent confict
and war as much as possible. In the end, democracy was part of the
story, but only a very small part with a subordinated role next to the
power dynamics during the Cold War, the costs of warfare and the benefts
of trade.

Some scholars found evidence that the democratic peace still exists in
the post-Cold War period (Park 2013) which weakens this argument.
However, [most analyses showed that dyadic dispute rates have converged
after the Cold War]{.underline} (see, e.g., Gowa 2011). [Moreover,
jointly democratic dyads are likely to be allied only after
1945]{.underline} (see Gibler and Sarkees 2004); [during the 1816--1944
time period, there is even a negative relationship between democratic
dyads and alliance formation.20 These findings cast serious doubts on
the idea of a general existence of democratic peace.]{.underline}

Not only the historical period, but also the stage of the confict is
crucial. Some scholars in this group provided evidence that democratic
peace is not universal, but that it depends on the stage and whether we
focus on the beginning, duration or severity of the confict. Although
joint democracy has some pacifying effects on the onset of confict, the
results suggest that they are unrelated to the escalation of disputes to
war (see Reed 2000). Moreover, democratic peace is dependent on the
neighbourhood instability. Democracies often have few territorial issues
over which to contend, as they tend to be part of a stable region.
Democracies only seldom have territorial disputes with their neighbours,
and therefore they can more easily choose favourable conficts to
escalate. The type of political system does not predict confict
selection or victory once controls are added for issue salience (Gibler
and Miller 2013; see also Park and James 2015). There is an interaction
between joint democracy and regional instability, which confrms the idea
that the effects of type of political system on continued confict apply
mostly to dyads in peaceful regions (Gibler and Braithwaite 2013; see
also Park and James 2015). Very democratic countries might even become
more aggressive and faster than other political systems, once the region
becomes more hostile (see, e.g., Baliga et al. 2011).

The General Lesson from the Results in a Nutshell (Caveat 1)

[In short, regardless of the differences between the statistical studies
on democratic peace, all findings have indicated that other explanations
are important as well. It is clear that democracy is just one of the
explanations, and certainly not the most important one,21 sometimes even
spurious and often heavily dependent on other factors. It is not (just)
democracy to be preoccupied with, when trying to prevent war between
countries]{.underline} (Table 3.1).

#### [DPT False]{.underline} --- [economic norms theory]{.underline} fully accounts for it.

**Mousseau 13** --- Michael Mousseau, Professor at the University of
Central Florida, teaching International Relations Theory, Political
Economy of War and Peace, and Terrorism and Insurgency, former professor

[Model 2 presents **new knowledge** by adding the control for economic
type]{.underline}. To capture the dyadic expectation of peace among
contract-intensive nations, [the variable Contract-intensive EconomyL
(CIEL) indicates the value of impersonal contracts in force per capita
of the state]{.underline} with the lower level of CIE in the dyad; [a
high value of this measure indicates both states have contract-intensive
economies]{.underline}. As can be seen, [the coefficient for
CIEL]{.underline} ()0.80) [is **negative** and **highly
significant**]{.underline}. [This corroborates that impersonal economy
is a highly robust force for peace]{.underline}. [The coefficient for
DemocracyL is now at **zero**]{.underline}. [There are **no other
differences between Models 1 and 2**]{.underline}, whose samples are
identical, and no prior study corroborating the democratic peace has
considered contract-intensive economy. Therefore, the standard
econometric inference to be drawn from Model 2 is the nontrivial result
that [**all prior reports** of democracy as a force for peace are
probably **spurious**, since this result is predicted and fully
accounted for by **economic norms theory**]{.underline}.

CIEL and DemocracyL correlate only in the moderate range of 0.47
(Pearson's r), so the insignificance of democracy is not likely to be a
statistical artifact of multicollinearity. This is corroborated by the
variance inflation factor for DemocracyL in Model 2 of 1.85, which is
well below the usual rule-of-thumb indicator of multicollinearity of 10
or more. Nor should readers assume most economies: [While almost all
nations with contract-intensive economies]{.underline} (as indicated
with the binary measure for CIE) [are democratic]{.underline} (Polity2
\> 6) (Singapore is the only long-term exception), [more than
half]{.underline}---55%---[of all democratic nation-years have
contract-poor economies]{.underline}. At the dyadic level in this
sample, [this translates to 80% of democratic dyads]{.underline} (all
dyads where DemocracyBinary6 = 1) [that have at least one state with a
contract-poor economy]{.underline}. In other words, [not only does Model
2 show no evidence of causation from democracy to peace]{.underline} (as
reported in Mousseau 2009), [but it also illustrates that this absence
of democratic peace includes the **vast majority**---80%---of democratic
dyad-years over the sample period]{.underline}.

[Nor is it likely that the causal arrow is reversed---with democracy
being the ultimate cause of contract-intensive economy and
peace]{.underline}. This is because [correlations among independent
variables are not calculated in the results of multivariate regressions:
Coefficients show only the effect of each variable after the potential
effects of the others]{.underline} are kept constant at their mean
levels. [If it was democracy that caused both impersonal economy and
peace, then there would be some variance in DemocracyL
remaining]{.underline}, after its partial correlation with CIEL is
excluded, [that links it directly with peace]{.underline}. [The positive
direction of the coefficient for DemocracyL informs us that no such
direct effect exists]{.underline} (Blalock 1979:473--474).

[Model 3 tests for the effect of DemocracyL if a control is added for
mixed-polity dyads]{.underline}, as suggested by Russett (2010:201). As
discussed above, to avoid problems of mathematical endogeneity, I adopt
tohe solution used by Mousseau, Orsun and Ungerer (2013) and measure
regime difference as proposed by Werner (2000), drawing on the
subcomponents of the Polity2 regime measure. As can be seen, the
coefficient for [Political Distance]{.underline} (1.00) is positive and
significant, corroborating that regime mixed dyads do indeed have more
militarized conflict than others. Yet, the [inclusion]{.underline} of
this term [has no effect on the results that concern us here:
CIEL]{.underline} ()0.85) [is now even more robust, and the coefficient
for DemocracyL]{.underline} (0.03) [is above zero]{.underline}.7

[Model 4 replaces the continuous democracy measure with the standard
binary one]{.underline} (Polity2 \> 6), as suggested by Russett
(2010:201), citing Bayer and Bernhard (2010). As can be observed, [the
coefficient for CIEL]{.underline} ()0.83) [remains **negative and highly
significant**, while DemocracyBinary6]{.underline} (0.63) [is in the
positive (**wrong**) direction]{.underline}.

As discussed above, [analyses of fatal dispute onsets with the far
stricter binary measure for democracy]{.underline} (Polity = 10), [put
forward by Dafoe]{.underline} (2011) in response to Mousseau (2009),
[yields perfect prediction]{.underline} (as does the prior binary
measure Both States CIE), [causing quasi-complete separation and
inconclusive results]{.underline}. Therefore, [Model 5 reports the
results with DemocracyBinary10 in analyses of all militarized conflicts,
not just fatal ones]{.underline}. As can be seen, the [coefficient for
DemocracyBinary10]{.underline} ()0.41), [while negative, is not
significant]{.underline}. [Model 6 reports the results in analyses of
fatal disputes with DemocracyL squared]{.underline} (after adding 10),
[which implies that the likelihood of conflict decreases more quickly
toward the high values of DemocracyL]{.underline}. As can be seen, [the
coefficient for DemocracyL 2 is at zero, further corroborating that even
very high levels of democracy do not appear to cause peace in analyses
of fatal disputes, once consideration is given to contractintensive
economy]{.underline}. [Models 3, 4, and 6, which include Political
Distance, were repeated]{.underline} (but unreported to save space)
[with analyses of all militarized interstate disputes, with the
democracy coefficients close to zero in every case]{.underline}.
Therefore, [the conclusions]{.underline} reached by Mousseau (2009) [are
corroborated even with the most stringent measures of democracy,
consideration of institutional distance, and across all specifications:
The democratic peace appears **spurious**, with contract-intensive
economy being the **more likely explanation** for both democracy and the
democratic peace]{.underline}.

[NATO allies have made slow but steady progress when it comes to
crafting policy to deal with cyber security challenges]{.underline}. Yet
this progress has not always been made in a collaborative fashion.
Especially when it comes to the development and deployment of offensive
cyber capabilities, NATO allies are increasingly diverging in policy.
This is a worrying development and deserves more attention than it has
so far received. Steady progress [Member states **agree on the critical
need** for a **coherent cyber policy.** Almost all NATO allies have
developed both a cyber security strategy and a cyber defense
strategy]{.underline}.[\[1\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn1)
Some states have published updated versions over the years to reaffirm
cyber security as an issue of national security importance, to tweak
institutional responsibilities, or to articulate changes in the threat
landscape. In addition, since 2018, [most NATO allies have established a
military cyber organization]{.underline} (either a command or unit) with
a mandate to conduct cyber effect operations -- that is, cyber
operations intended to disrupt, deny, degrade and/or
destroy.[\[2\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn2)
There is also **[shared recognition that international law applies in
cyberspace]{.underline}**, although allies have yet to spell out the
legal procedures for operating in this new "domain of warfare." These
developments have been both [reflected in, and aided by, policy progress
made at the inter-governmental level]{.underline}. At the Prague Summit
in 2002, [NATO for the first time recognized that the Alliance should
"Strengthen]{.underline} our **[capabilities to defend against cyber
attacks]{.underline}**."[\[3\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn3)
In 2008, at the Bucharest Summit, there was another milestone
development, when [NATO adopted a "Policy on Cyber Defense," aiming to
"protect **key information**]{.underline} systems **[in accordance with
their respective responsibilities]{.underline}**; [share best practices;
and provide a capability to assist Allied nations]{.underline}, upon
request, to counter a cyber
attack."[\[4\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn4)
In the same year, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence --
a NATO accredited international research institution -- was established
in Tallinn, Estonia. In 2016, at the Warsaw Summit, cyberspace was
officially recognized as a "domain of operations" and allies made a
Cyber Defense Pledge to enhance their cyber
defenses.[\[5\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn5)
The 2018 Brussels Summit and 2020 London Summit reiterated NATO's
commitment to implement the Cyber Defense Pledge and operationalize the
Cyber Operations Center, responsible for situational awareness and the
centralized planning of cyber operations and
missions.[\[6\]](https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide/#_ftn6)
In January 2020, the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations was

### 1NC \-\-- Alt Causes

#### Alt causes for NATO collapse

**Boffey 18** (Daniel Boffey; Guardian\'s Brussels bureau chief;
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/transatlantic-relationship-at-risk-says-nato-chief>;
6-19-18)

[The head of Nato]{.underline} has [warned that the deep divisions
between the US]{.underline} under Donald Trump [and its European allies
are not going away and there is no certainty that the transatlantic
relationship and its military alliance will survive]{.underline}.
Against a backdrop of Trump's open baiting of the German chancellor,
Angela Merkel, over immigration and her domestic difficulties, Jens
Stoltenberg has called for all Nato members to work to avoid a
disastrous breakdown in western unity. Writing in the Guardian, Nato's
secretary general admits that "[political storm clouds" are putting a
strain on]{.underline} the [ties]{.underline} that bind the Nato allies.
But, in an appeal to leaders before the military alliance's summit in
July, the former prime minister of Norway says that "where differences
persist, we must limit any negative impact on our security cooperation".
Stoltenberg -- who is meeting Theresa May in Downing Street on Thursday
as he prepares for the summit in Brussels -- writes: "Since the alliance
was created almost 70 years ago, the people of Europe and North America
have enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity. But, at
the political level, the ties which bind us are under strain. "**[There
are real differences between]{.underline}** the United States and other
**[allies over issues such as trade, climate change and]{.underline}**
the **[Iran]{.underline}** nuclear agreement. "[These disagreements are
real and they won't disappear overnight.]{.underline} In fact,
**[nowhere is it written in stone that the transatlantic bond will
always thrive]{.underline}**. That doesn't, however, mean that its
breakdown is inevitable. We can maintain it, and all the mutual benefits
we derive from it." Stoltenberg's intervention comes at a point of
extreme tension among the leadership of the western powers. In seeking
to defend his administration's policy of separating children from their
parents at the country's border, Trump launched an extraordinary attack
on Merkel and the EU on Tuesday, likening Europe to a "migrant camp"
while claiming that "the people of Germany are turning against their
leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin
coalition". Merkel is embroiled in a tense standoff with her interior
minister over immigration. She faces a two-week deadline to find a
European solution or risk the collapse of her governing coalition. Trump
has already caused a fracture in relations with traditional US allies by
reneging on his country's commitments in both the Paris climate change
agreement and the nuclear deal with Iran. He is also threatening a
transatlantic trade war with the EU, and has criticised Germany and
others for not spending enough on defence and freeloading off the US. Of
the 29 Nato members, only eight, including the US and the UK, spend more
than 2% of their GDP on defence, a threshold that the alliance agreed
should be met by all the countries by 2024. Germany spent €37bn
(£32.5bn), or 1.2% of GDP, on defence last year. Asked for his position
last month on those countries underspending, Trump warned: "They'll be
dealt with." Greater "[burden sharing" is set to be a theme of the Nato
summit]{.underline} in Brussels, along with Stoltenberg's desire to
improve the readiness of Nato forces to deploy in quick order, and to
build on the alliance's counter-terrorism efforts, including through the
training of the Iraqi military and an extension of financing for Afghan
forces until 2024.

Testing Alliance Consensus and Decision-making [The Alliance's
decision-making principle of consensus further complicates the
negotiations and agreement of a NATO offensive cyber
policy.]{.underline} The above-mentioned nuclear example almost
exclusively concerns kinetic and state-level physical destruction of
massive proportions. The dire consequences of the extremity of possible
nuclear proliferation are enough to establish credibility, deterrence,
and is a comparatively simpler way in getting its 30 member states on
board, especially in the context of Cold War bipolarity. [Cyberspace as
a domain of war contains a myriad of vested technical issues including
the difficulty of attributing attacks to specific
adversaries.]{.underline} Even though this is one the most prominent
difficulties according to a variety of research in cybersecurity, more
recent analyses published by NATO\'s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence have suggested that the attribution gap is gradually
decreasing in size due to heavy research and development investment into
web tracing and identification designs largely spearheaded by the US
(Burton 11). A dynamic understanding of deterrence in cyberspace as
formerly suggested by taking into consideration social and historical
context will also alleviate the traditionally 'impossible' problem of
attribution. While such technical capabilities play a crucial role in
swaying the allies' considerations and decisions, the political and
strategic issues of simply conceptualizing an offensive cyber policy are
examined in closer detail here. Trust and Transparency [The transparency
and capability-sharing quality of NATO may give way for disagreement
amongst allies]{.underline}. Although the Alliance's communication on a
strategic and policy level is transparent, [it still possesses enough
opaque room to maneuver on an operational and tactical
level.]{.underline} Furthermore, the problem of [American supremacy in
cyber capabilities]{.underline} and NATO's reliance on its critical
perspective [may displease EU member states]{.underline} like France [in
their pursuit of strategic autonomy]{.underline} aside from its
prevailing aversion to today\'s American leadership. A new demand for
[cross-alliance intelligence-sharing on offensive cyber capabilities can
also exacerbate internal trust issues with the US.]{.underline} The
global [surveillance disclosures]{.underline} from 2013 onwards
[revealed allied surveillance and spying activities which damaged
confidence in NATO (Smeets; 2018). Discussion of further integrated
intelligence-sharing strategy under an offensive cyber policy can create
tension between Five Eyes states (Canada, the US, and the UK) and other
NATO allies]{.underline}. Doctrine Diversity Another overarching aspect
with the potential to determine allies' reception and leniency towards
an offensive cyber strategy is the diversity of threat perception among
NATO allies[. The diversity across allied standards in defining the
parameters of cyberattacks and the lack of overarching offensive cyber
policy could result in strategic ambiguity and discourage retaliation
(Arts 2). These differences stem from varied threat perceptions and
cyber norms.]{.underline} Nationally, both threat perception and cyber
norms are influenced by the state's experience with malicious
cyberattacks and its media and public opinion; and externally, the
state's engagement in bilateral and multilateral engagements are the
most effective ways in which threat perception and cyber norms are
shaped (Lewis 575). This hints at the political interest of near-Russia
states like Estonia and Finland to possess well-rounded cyber norms and
threat perception. Conversely, policy engagements on offensive
capabilities would also shape NATO allies' understanding as a whole.
[Without multilateral definitions, allies like Luxembourg and Iceland
who have not experienced similar events do not benefit from harmonized
knowledge and may not find justification to prioritize the strengthening
of cyber capabilities when allocating funds from the common NATO
budget]{.underline}. Not to mention the financial commitment issue
affects trust in the Alliance overall as well.

Concerning the three categories and the potential policy shifting
described above, NATO finds itself in a difficult situation that, under
current NATO practices, will be hard to escape. In terms of the cyber
threat, defense, and technology approaches, NATO reflects behavior that
puts the Alliance at a disadvantage. [NATO tends to be conservative in
terms of legal issues, meaning that the Alliance does]{.underline} not
[promise]{.underline} to be [a fruitful forum for]{.underline} adapting
or revising legacy rules to reflect the particular challenges
**[cyber]{.underline}** poses. Similarly, with NATO operating on the
basis of consensus, the [Alliance's decision-making
processes]{.underline} might have [difficulty handling governance
questions created by the cyber]{.underline} defense
**[approach]{.underline}**, such as how "active" should NATO cyber
defense be. Operationally, NATO cyber defense appears more static and
reactive than active in orientation---a situation that could lead NATO
cyber defense to become a cyber "Maginot line" rather than an effective
defensive strategy. It is [not clear whether NATO members could reach
consensus]{.underline} on what more active cyber defense activities
would be permissible under international legal principles on sovereignty
and non-intervention. As noted earlier, NATO functions with the
capabilities its members make available to it, meaning that NATO's
technological capabilities in cyber might not reach cutting-edge status,
leaving NATO cyber defense behind the global technological curve in
cyberspace. This problem is exacerbated if policy makers in leading
powers, such as the United States and China, are placing more reliance
on developing, deploying, and using full-spectrum cyber technological
capabilities because of the perceived pitfalls of other approaches and
the mounting geopolitical competition now affecting cyberspace. [NATO
members are also extraordinarily sensitive to the Alliance having any
offensive cyber capabilities or even discussing the need to think
about]{.underline} the value of [cyber capabilities and
operations]{.underline} in missions [NATO might undertake]{.underline}
(as NATO has done with other technological developments affecting its
military missions).44 The North Atlantic Council has not discussed, let
alone authorized, the development of offensive capabilities, doctrine,
or rules of engagement in the cyber realm.45 [Whether NATO members could
agree on]{.underline} what **[offensive cyber operations]{.underline}**
international law would permit [is also not clear, especially in light
of difficulties cyber presents to the international law]{.underline} on
armed conflict **[revealed by the Tallinn Manual]{.underline}** and
other analyses.46 Events outside the specific context of NATO cyber
defense might also adversely affect NATO cooperation. For example, in
June 2013, negative [European reactions to the disclosure of a secret
U.S. surveillance program targeting cyber activities]{.underline} of
foreign nationals, code-named PRISM, [reflected new transAtlantic
tensions on **government surveillance in cyberspace**]{.underline}, its
implications for privacy and other civil liberties, and the potential
for European-American cooperation on cybersecurity. The Washington Post
reported that "\[t\]he **[discontent from Europe pointed]{.underline}**
to the breadth of fallout from the affair and [to the potential for
fresh strains between the United States and allies wary of American
intrusiveness]{.underline}."47 Whatever the long-term impact of this
political fallout, [the short-term consequences will likely not create
more willingness among NATO members to become more
ambitious]{.underline} with NATO cyber defense.

Challenges to a smooth integration of cyber effects

[The abovementioned incidents have led cyber-conflict scholars to point
to **several technical** and **practical difficulties** in the
operational integration of cyber effects]{.underline}.29 In the
interviews and background conversations that contributed to this study,
three of these difficulties were continuously reiterated when discussing
successful integration of cyber effects into NATO operational planning:
the temporal dimension of developing exploits; the assessment of battle
damage; and the problem of confliction.

Developing exploits---a matter of time

One of the characteristics of [cyber attacks that receives most
attention is the fact that they **hit suddenly** and **without
warning**]{.underline}.30 While this is often the case, [the central
question for operational integration is not the speed at which they hit
their target, but the speed with which the tools and techniques that
exploit IT vulnerabilities in order to deliver cyber effects can be
developed]{.underline}. Like conventional weapons, the cyber tools---the
exploits or cyber weapons---take time to develop. [However, an exploit
is often harder to reuse than a conventional weapon, as it is more
dependent on a meticulous analysis and target preparation---in this
case, specifically, the target\'s IT infrastructure]{.underline}.
Without knowing the adversary\'s IT systems and its vulnerabilities
better than the adversary itself, meaningful cyber weapons are
impossible to develop.

[The fact that knowledge about the target is linked not only to the
deployment of a weapon but also to its development influences the extent
to which it can be used and reused]{.underline}. [Stuxnet, for example,
required **years of development**, **testing** and **perfecting** before
it could deliver the intended effect on the Iranian
centrifuges]{.underline}. Despite the techniques used in the Stuxnet
malware having been found in other malware,31 Stuxnet lost its ability
to destroy the centrifuges when it was discovered and the IT
vulnerabilities that enabled it were patched. Importantly, part of the
complexity of Stuxnet relates to the US--Israeli intention to keep the
effect secret. In a hot conflict, secrecy in terms of the effect is
often less important, and thus the development and deployment of cyber
effects do not necessarily have to be as complex and time-consuming.

This observation does not necessarily change the fact that the
[development of exploits often has to **precede** the military
confrontation in which they are intended to be used]{.underline}. [NATO
states that want to deliver cyber effects in NATO operations must try to
gain access to Russia\'s or other potential adversaries\' critical
military networks to identify and exploit IT
vulnerabilities]{.underline}. As several informants emphasized, [if
states wait for a conflict to escalate before they begin the development
of exploits, it is most likely to be **already too
late**.]{.underline}32

[The alternative to penetrating adversary networks in peacetime is for
states to rely on the exploitation of vulnerabilities in as many
commercial off-the-shelf products as possible]{.underline}. This can be
done, for example, by purchasing exploits from private companies
offering this service, in the hope that it will then be possible to
quickly create an overview of the enemy\'s IT infrastructure and adapt
the exploits to this environment when a conflict escalates. [The latter
approach is more likely to succeed against adversaries with low network
security, which does not apply in the case of Russia, or in contexts
where less sophisticated and less closely targeted cyber effects are
required]{.underline}.

Whether member states develop sophisticated exploits for future targeted
effects or stockpile well-known exploits to cause more minor effects,
[they **cannot**---as several informants indicated---**be certain** that
they will be able to deliver the cyber effect at the specific time it is
requested by CYOC.]{.underline} [This is because the IT vulnerabilities
upon which exploits depend **might not exist** for ever]{.underline}.
[Cyberspace is a **dynamic environment**: vulnerabilities are patched,
systems are updated or replaced and bad IT security practices are
identified and improved. This means that exploits are **temporary in
nature** and **cannot be stored** for later use]{.underline}.33 [States
must constantly ensure that the exploits still work, which requires
minor adjustments when updates take place. As a consequence, the larger
the military 'cyber arsenal', the more **technically skilled** human
resources are needed for its maintenance]{.underline}. [In the current
labour market, where recruitment and retention of a cyber workforce is
difficult, extensive investment is required for states to be able to
stand ready with cyber effects available when requested]{.underline}.

In short, [if a state is to offer a cyber effect in a NATO operation,
then the state is likely to have to be able, first, to predict what
Russian IT systems it is going to target months or years in advance, and
second, to marshal the necessary resources to develop and maintain a
large array of exploits that can be used against these systems. Even if
this is successfully done, the state still faces difficulty in ensuring
that an effect is delivered as promised.]{.underline}

Assessing effects---ensuring proportionality and discrimination

[How likely is it that the requested cyber effect will be delivered? The
answer to this question is **not clear**, in respect of either its
preparation or its execution]{.underline}. [This is not only because IT
vulnerabilities are constantly discovered and patched; it is also
because of the difficulty of assessing the effects and possible
side-effects of an exploit when navigating and analysing complex IT
infrastructures. In other words, reconnaissance is difficult in
cyberspace, and so is the containment of effects]{.underline}. The
Russian attempt to use ransomware aimed at disrupting critical Ukrainian
infrastructure in 2017, for example, succeeded---but simultaneously
encrypted computers globally, causing substantial economic damage to
multinational businesses such as Maersk and FedEx.34

[**Collateral damage** and **unintended consequences** are **serious
issues** for NATO]{.underline}. The alliance takes pride in its
adherence to the principles laid out in international law, such as
proportionality and discrimination, as former NATO Deputy Assistant
Secretary-General Jamie Shea has emphasized.35 [Thus, disruptions of
servers with huge negative implications for civilians, or the use of
generic cyber tools that risk spreading their effects far and wide, are
most likely **not going to be considered** for use in NATO
operations]{.underline}. Indeed, one of the main challenges to US
efforts to disrupt servers in working against ISIS was finding ways to
ensure that civilians were not hit by their cyber effects.36

[Another aspect of the difficulty of assessing the cyber effect relates
to adversaries\' cyber defence efforts. For the more sophisticated
players in cyberspace, cyber defence has developed into more than simply
patching, clearing and updating systems. Cyber defence is also
increasingly about following an intruder\'s activity in one\'s own
network and creating 'honeypots' or 'honeynets'; or about following data
traffic back to the intruder\'s network. In short, cyber defence is also
about deception and active defence.]{.underline}37 This approach to
cyber defence offers valuable insights into the intruder\'s techniques
and strategies; but the mere knowledge that deception is becoming a
predominant defensive strategy also introduces doubts into the
intruder\'s assessment of possible effects.

Consequently, as Russia is considered a peer competitor with
considerable cyber-defensive capacities[, one informant expressed
**scepticism** about the extent to which smaller member states are
**confident** in their ability to deliver a cyber effect when it is
requested by NATO.38 This is especially the case if operational success
depends on a **specific effect**]{.underline}. Even if a state has
developed the appropriate exploit, it must also be able to verify that
the effect is achieved and ensure that the effect is contained to
minimize collateral damage. And even if a state is confident about its
current ability to contain and verify an effect, it must also be
confident that it can deliver, verify and contain the effect at the
specific time in the future when CYOC requests it.

[The process of integration is **further complicated** by the fact that
NATO must be willing to hand over to contributing states the
responsibility for making battle damage assessments and collateral
damage estimations]{.underline}. As the following subsection shows,
[states are generally **unwilling to share** classified information
about exploits]{.underline}. Hence, [the delegated NATO commander is
**unlikely to receive** much useful information about how cyber effects
are delivered before a decision about their deployment must be
taken]{.underline}. As commanders would prefer to have control over the
capabilities used, member-state cyber effects are likely choices of
method only if alternative, conventional effects are unavailable.

The challenges associated with assessing cyber effects are naturally
most significant in relation to those effects that enable other kinetic
effects that are necessary to achieve operational success. [For cyber
effects that seek to maintain a persistent annoyance of Russian
networks, these challenges are less of an issue. If the aim is to create
confusion and drain resources by targeting networks and operations that
are otherwise difficult and expensive to disrupt using conventional
means, then cyber effects can support strategic goals without causing
irreversible damage to civilians]{.underline}. As I will conclude at the
end of this section, such a change demands an adaptation of the way in
which CYOC operates.

C. [Capability and Force Development Priorities **Assuming NATO can
overcome** conceptual and policy hurdles, **significant effort** will
still be required to develop the **necessary forces** and
**capabilities** across all domains, but perhaps especially for
cyberspace.]{.underline}

[Operationalising MDO demands a '**calibrated force posture'** with
multi-domain formations **strategically positioned**, held at
**readiness** and able to deploy over **large distances**, **trained**
and **equipped**]{.underline} to operate across multiple contested
domains (Grispen-Gelens, 2020). The vision is for different sensors and
shooters to share and fuse data, build a common operating picture,
inform rapid decision-making and deliver effects at a time and place of
the commander's choosing and to do so agnostic of domains, nation,
service or platform (Niewood, Grant & Lewis, 2019). [Forces must operate
at pace and against an adversary contesting all domains. This tempo
necessitates moving beyond NATO's past focus on synchronisation of
pre-planned effects in individual domains towards more agile targeting
and more resilience against hostile attempts at 'disorganisation' or
'systems attack']{.underline} (Thomas, 2019; Engstrom, 2018).

[Linking all this together demands **novel approaches** to
C4ISR]{.underline}, as reflected in investments in JADC2 (Harrigian,
2020). [This US initiative leverages advances in information and
communication technologies such as mesh networks, cloud and edge
computing, open architectures, data analytics, AI and machine learning,
autonomy and automation, software-defined systems, robotics, satellite
communications and sophisticated cyber and EMS capabilities]{.underline}
(Hitchens, 2019). Future JADC2 networks must be secure, robust,
resilient, agile and more decentralised, with enough bandwidth to share
data in a timely and secure manner despite cyber attacks, jamming,
spoofing or physical destruction of communication nodes (Goldfein,
2017). [Trust is also **essential**, handling data from different
sources and at multiple security levels without making controls so
arduous that Reliance on connectivity makes cyberspace, space and the
EMS the 'centre of gravity' for MDO]{.underline} (Hess et al., 2019).
[JADC2 introduces **obvious challenges** from a cyber threat
perspective, both in terms of the attack surface for different threat
vectors and the cascading effects from hostile cyber
activity]{.underline}---though, of course, existing centralised C2 hubs
also have their own vulnerabilities to cyber or physical attack (Hess et
al., 2019). [Improved cyber capabilities are not only needed to
**secure** and **enable** operations in **other domains**]{.underline}
(Reilly, 2020[). Investments by Russia and China to contest cyberspace
and the EMS may also **limit the ability** of NATO commanders to employ
**offensive cyber capabilities** at a time and place that will
'converge' with effects through other domains.]{.underline} Securing
networks against disruption is critical at the operational and strategic
levels given requirements for reach-back to headquarters, especially
constraining organisations responsible for delivering offensive cyber
effects, since these are likely to be physically located in the homeland
(Watling & Roper, 2019; Nettis, 2020).

While NATO and its member states adapted to the new security environment
after the end of the Cold War by scaling down the military investments
and presence in eastern Europe and by focusing more on crisis
management,53 much of the Cold War deterrence language returned when the
Russian--Ukrainian conflict broke out in 2014.54 What needs to be
deterred today, much of the literature agrees, is not only a full-scale
military invasion but to a larger extent the use and support of
pro-Russian militant separatists who are willing to apply insurgency
tactics in NATO\'s post-Soviet member states.55 [As a result, the
allies\' military investments have been increasing again]{.underline},56
a number of initiatives such as the Enhanced Forward Presence in the
Baltic States and Poland have been introduced,57 and the
discussions---and disagreements---on the nuclear deterrence (of
non-nuclear threats) have re-emerged.58 [Such responses are often
presented as a renewed attempt by NATO to reassert its deterrence and
assurance posture by signalling strength, preparedness and willingness
to punish 'bad' behaviour]{.underline}.59

At first sight, the introduction of CYOC seems to add to these
deterrence efforts. NATO added an offensive cyber option to reinforce
its ability to impose costs sufficient to dissuade adversaries from
acting aggressively. [On closer examination, however, it is not
self-evident that requesting member states\' delivery of offensive cyber
effects in NATO operations constitutes a **necessary** or even a
**substantial addition** to credibly signalling the ability and
willingness to punish an adversary]{.underline}. [NATO\'s conventional
capabilities are clearly already far superior to Russia\'s---with or
without fully integrated cyber effects.]{.underline} [Thus, a deterrence
failure, resulting for example in a scenario in one of the Baltic states
similar to that which occurred in eastern Ukraine, will **not be the
result** of NATO\'s lack of available cyber tools in its military
toolbox]{.underline}; rather, if the Russian leadership were to consider
it in its interest to pursue such a scenario, it would mean that
Russia\'s decision-makers did not believe in the credibility of NATO\'s
article 5 or in NATO\'s ability to mobilize its forces. [The capacity to
integrate cyber effects would do **nothing to change**
that.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [if the establishment of CYOC is an attempt to signal
defensive strength and unity in cyberspace, it remains **difficult to
imagine** that such signalling would **dissuade adversaries** from
trying to penetrate NATO and allied systems. CYOC does not change the
fact that NATO is **not tasked** to govern and secure national IT
systems.]{.underline} In an operational setting, states might connect to
each other through so-called federated mission networking;60 but there
is no tradition of ceding control of the deployed national networks to
NATO during military operations. [Hence, CYOC can only realistically
seek to become a hub for cyber-threat information-sharing and to support
states\' coordination and synchronization of various national responses
to these threats. In other words, CYOC is **unlikely** to become an
active defender in cyberspace that causes doubt in the adversary\'s
evaluation of its own cyber capabilities]{.underline}. [This also means
that even if CYOC\'s coordination and information-sharing efforts manage
to contribute to the denial of intrusions into allied systems, an
adversary\'s military is unlikely to be deterred from trying to hack
these systems. In fact, actively articulating that CYOC is supposed to
deter (through denial) a perceived adversary such as Russia from hacking
NATO and allied operational systems creates an incentive to do just that
and thereby show that the alliance is incapable of doing what it says it
seeks to do.]{.underline}

It could be argued, [given NATO's defensive orientation ( pace Russian
fears of diabolic plots), that a **purely defensive** and **technical
focus** for cyber operations is appropriate]{.underline}. [The question,
however, is whether NATO can field a credible military force without
some public linkage to an offensive cyber capability.]{.underline}

Here again, [the **nuclear precedent** offers some suggestions for a way
forward.]{.underline} In the NATO phonetic alphabet, "whiskey" ("W") and
"romeo" ("R") were used by NATO's command structure in conflict to
"warn" capitals that with a deteriorating situation on the ground it
would be sending a request to release nuclear weapons for NATO use.
Romeo was the actual request for release of nuclear weapons to NATO
control. This terminology prepared nuclear capitals to make the decision
on release.

[Just as nuclear weapons remain under national control but senior NATO
commanders can request their release, the US and UK could retain control
of offensive cyber capabilities but be prepared to make them available
to NATO commanders upon request]{.underline}. In practice[, national
teams could be assigned to support NATO commanders in theatre or could
carry out some operations against targets selected by NATO commanders
form their national duty station.]{.underline}

[Dissimulation is an essential part of hybrid warfare, and Europe and
the US face a propaganda barrage that is much more sophisticated than
the clumsy Soviet efforts of the Cold War]{.underline}. Despite this
clumsiness, a good portion of the Western public has found it
persuasive. Similarly, those critical of NATO will find new complaints
about aggression and militarisation credible. [Russia has **already
complained** that NATO's **defensive cyber doctrine** is **destabilising
warmongering** and part of a larger conspiracy to **advance western
hegemony**]{.underline}.11 [The Snowden revelations have lent a powerful
impetus to Russian propaganda.]{.underline}

[Behind the rhetoric lies]{.underline} both a desire to conceal their
own use of cyber operations and [a **real fear** that Russia's decline
leaves it **vulnerable** to new military technologies.]{.underline} The
intent is to hamper and complicate any Western response to Russian
efforts to regain control in Crimea and the "near abroad". [The Russian
position is that NATO's new cyber doctrine is **destabilising** as it
threatens to use conventional or even **nuclear responses**]{.underline}
(in the Russian description of the new policy towards low-level cyber
attacks).

[**Any announcement** by NATO relating to **offensive cyber
capabilities** would be greeted with **alarm** and **vitriol** in
Moscow]{.underline}. However, the effect on stability would likely be
less pronounced. [NATO-Russia relations are already in steep decline. It
is possible that any NATO announcement would accelerate
this]{.underline}, but it is also possible that Russia could recalculate
the risk of further adventures if it were faced with a stronger defence.
In terms of opponent attitudes, there is probably little effect.
[Russia, along with NATO's other potential military opponents, is likely
to **overestimate both capabilities** and coordination among NATO member
states and **underestimate NATO's will** to defend]{.underline}. [This
is an unhappy combination as it makes aggression against NATO seem
**less risky**.]{.underline}

NATO's decision on how cyber attacks could trigger Article 5, while
greeted with complaints, had a stabilising effect. It made clear to
potential opponents that cyber attacks are not risk-free. Similarly, a
clear enunciation of how NATO would use offensive cyber capabilities as
part of any defensive operation would also change opponents' risk
calculations in ways that would force them to consider how offensive
actions, even if intended to be covert, are not free of risk or cost.

The Cyber Club

Some level of cyber capability is being acquired by all advanced
militaries, and perhaps a dozen countries can be identified from public
sources as procuring offensive cyber capabilities. These countries
include several NATO members. [As with nuclear weapons, the capability
to undertake offensive cyber operations is a club within a club in NATO,
with largely the same membership -- the US, the UK and
France.]{.underline} Germany's armed forces may also be developing
offensive cyber capabilities.12 The well-developed procedures for
release and for integration into NATO planning created for nuclear
weapons do not exist for cyber attack, although it is currently far more
likely that any NATO military operation will have a cyber component,
while the use of nuclear weapons is almost unthinkable.

[The US and the UK both possess elite cyber capabilities. They also have
a close partnership in cyber espionage.]{.underline} This partnership is
centred on a relationship between the US National Security Agency (NSA)
and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), both of
which are intelligence agencies with a long history of supporting
military operations. US military cyber operations are the responsibility
of U.S. Cyber Command, whose commander is also the head of the NSA.
Cyber operations blur the line between intelligence and military
activities. The fact, however, that these are intelligence agencies has
a created a certain reticence regarding the sharing of information on
capabilities and plans, which complicates the integration of offensive
cyber into NATO planning and doctrine.

[Offensive cyber capabilities are still **too new**, with too many
**unknown risks** that hold potentially **profound political
consequences**]{.underline}. US policy is that only the President can
approve a cyber operation likely to result in "significant consequences"
that could produce loss of life or a damaging reaction, although the
Secretary of Defense or the head of U.S. Cyber Command can take
independent action in an emergency[. US policy restricts independent
action by tactical and operational commanders for this reason. A local
commander may not know all the trade-offs or the risks that using a
cyber attack could entail]{.underline}. That said, all of these problems
are manageable with some decision-making model based on the precedent of
the warning and request system used for nuclear weapons release.13

[Until there are better predictive tools and judgments about risk and
consequences, offensive cyber operations will require a **politically
sensitive decision** as to when the benefit of an attack outweighs the
**political risk**]{.underline}. Additional coordination mechanisms
would be needed to decide when the benefits of an attack outweigh the
risk of a loss of intelligence capabilities, or when a target justifies
expending a weapon that might never work again. [The inability to
predict **collateral damage** and **uncertainty** over political effect
encourage caution in the use of offensive cyber operations, but that is
not the same as advertising possession of the capability.]{.underline}

With the world worried about the risk of nuclear escalation between
Russia and the West[, now might also be a good time to worry about the
risk of cyber conflict **escalating to war** as well.]{.underline}

In recent years, a number of scholars and practitioners have argued that
cyber conflict should be seen as an intelligence battle or
pressure-release valve rather than something that could escalate into
actual conflict or war. [Indeed, to date, no state has responded to a
rival's cyber attack with a kinetic reprisal. But that does not mean it
will not happen now. As **geopolitical circumstances** change, the
**escalatory potential** of cyber capabilities is **likely to change**
as well.]{.underline}

[Moscow]{.underline}, for example, [might respond]{.underline} to
Western sanctions [with **intensified cyber attacks**]{.underline}. Or
Western leaders, recognizing that no-fly zones are too risky, might
approve cyber interventions to prevent civilian massacres instead. In
either case, they could well assume this escalation would not meet with
a direct military response. And in either case, they could be wrong.

[Minimizing this risk requires both recognizing and respecting the
latent but **strong escalatory potential** of cyber attacks. It also
involves delving deeper into the psychology of the situation, as
escalation will be driven as much by the perceptions and misperceptions
of the participants as any technical aspects of cyber
warfare.]{.underline}

The Great News

So far, cyber attacks have not proven particularly escalatory or
effective on the battlefield. Even the most provocative incidents that
came closest to resembling kinetic attacks, such as Stuxnet or the
ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, have not led to particularly
menacing crises, much less war. If anything, over the past decade cyber
capabilities have helped de-escalate crises, acting as a "non-kinetic
option for leaders who feel pressure to act in a crisis, but who are
wary of using force."

The U.S. conflict with Iran offers a clear example. After Iran attacked
several oil tankers and downed a U.S. drone in June 2019, President
Donald Trump canceled punitive U.S. airstrikes at the last minute out of
concern that the casualties could prompt further escalation. However, he
allowed nonlethal cyber disruption of Iranian computer systems,
anticipating Iran would not respond violently. Indeed, Iran's supreme
leader "blocked any large, direct retaliation," limiting the country's
response to the cyber realm.

Scholars have offered different explanations for the non-escalatory
nature of these attacks. Cyber effects are "uncertain and often
relatively limited" and "offer great powers escalatory offramps \[and\]
signaling mechanisms" to de-escalate. In the "cyber strategic
competitive space short of armed conflict," states have "tacitly agreed
on lower and upper bounds" and accordingly "have mutual interests in
avoiding escalation to violent conflict." Cyber conflict also has
characteristics of an intelligence, not military, contest.

The Bad News

[Cyber conflicts have flourished during a relatively peaceful time when
major powers generally did not invade one another]{.underline}. [Perhaps
cyber capabilities acted as a pressure release simply because in the
post-Cold War period states usually wanted to de-escalate and the
geopolitical stakes were not that high anyway? What happens now when
Moscow feels that the stakes are **much higher**?]{.underline}

Already [there have been warnings that if Russian forces face **further
setbacks**, Putin may **lash out** in **desperate** and ultimately
**self-harming ways**.]{.underline} [A major cyber power has never faced
such a crisis before, so past performance may be a **limited indicator**
of **future potential**. In fact, the very perception that cyber attacks
are non-escalatory might itself **increase the risk** of unintended
escalation.]{.underline}

[There are multiple ways cyber conflict around the Ukrainian invasion
might escalate into a **direct conflict** between **Russia and
NATO**]{.underline}, possibly as a result of either side's offensives.

First, [Russian offensive cyber operations might spark a **wider
war**]{.underline}. President Vladimir Putin has declared sanctions "are
akin to a declaration of war" and may see aggressive cyber attacks as
the perfect response, particularly since they are reversible and
non-lethal. Russia has been entangled with Western economies for
decades, especially in the realms of energy and finance. But now, as
ties are being severed quickly and viciously, Russia no longer has to
fear the backlash if its cyber forces were to disrupt Western banks or
liquified natural gas terminals. If you are dealt out of the game, why
not just flip the table?

[Russia's cyber generals may be just as **enthusiastic** as their Army
counterparts]{.underline}. They may assure Putin their forces are ready
for battle and can quickly and bloodlessly get the West to back down.
Putin could be convinced disruptive attacks against the West are no big
deal, a low-cost signal that the West should de-escalate or just the
next natural move in a non-escalatory intelligence contest[. After all,
U.S. research found that in response to cyber attacks, "Americans are
less likely to **support retaliation with force**" compared to a more
traditional strike.]{.underline}

[This can **lead to escalation** in two ways. The United States ---
along with countries like the United Kingdom, France, and the
Netherlands --- might well decide to defend forward against such
attacks]{.underline}. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the commander of U.S. Cyber
Command, has insisted his forces "must take this fight to the enemy,
just as we do in other aspects of conflict." His then-deputy has also
argued that the United States "cannot cede any territory" to adversaries
as the "Russians will keep pushing until we push back on them."

Worse, Dmitri Alperovitch recently warned that [if Russia launches cyber
attacks after "\[h\]aving already exhausted the power of economic
sanctions, America and its European allies would have few choices other
than to respond to these attacks with offensive cyber-strikes of their
own." Such dynamics can feed a **spiraling escalation** in cyberspace
that might take on a life outside of the control of
policymakers]{.underline}.

Second, [Western offensive cyber operations might **spark
war**.]{.underline} U.S. cyber espionage and operations against Putin,
his cronies, or Russia's military forces will appear far more ominous to
Putin if he believes they are aimed at regime change. Could Putin turn
the other cheek if the United States were to electronically raid the
cryptocurrency wallets of Russia's sanctions-avoiding kleptocrats? He
might feel the need to escalate his own cyber operations as part of his
own version of defending forward.

[Escalation could happen on the battlefield as well]{.underline}.
According to the New York Times, teams from U.S. Cyber Command are "in
place to interfere with Russia's digital attacks and communications."
Other teams are almost certainly collecting digital intelligence on the
location and intent of Russian combat forces. The United States is
sharing such intelligence with the Ukrainians but apparently not yet
providing any real-time targeting. That may change soon, as the United
States seeks to alleviate intensifying attacks on civilians. And with
his KGB-bred paranoia, Putin might already see the presence of U.S.
defensive and intelligence teams operating on or against Russian
military networks as evidence of direct U.S. involvement in the war.
Confirming his apparent belief that Ukraine is just a NATO puppet, this
might force a response, either inside or outside of cyberspace.

Further, if Western governments have infiltrated Russia's operational
military networks, they may feel pressure to disrupt those networks to
prevent civilian massacres. [Because cyber capabilities are billed as
non-lethal, reversible, and non-escalatory, tub-thumping newspapers may
push decision-makers to take shots they **might not
otherwise**]{.underline}: "We can't create a no-fly zone but can use
cyber capabilities to prevent civilian harm." Some well-meaning national
leaders may succumb to this pressure, potentially causing a larger
conflict.

Crisis," *War on the Rocks,* Available Online at

However, [conducting cyber operations to signal deterrence would,
paradoxically, **increase risks of escalation**]{.underline}. [This risk
is not just hypothetical, especially in light of Russia's updated
declaratory policy for the **first use of nuclear weapons**, which may
include responses to cyber attacks]{.underline}. [Russia has
**reinforced this message** during the war in Ukraine.]{.underline} In
early March, a hacking group affiliated with Anonymous claimed that it
had shut down the control center of Russia's space agency. While denying
that the attack took place, [Russia nevertheless warned that a cyber
attack against its satellites would be a justification for
war.]{.underline}

The Biden administration should clearly communicate that cyber
operations for nuclear signaling are out of bounds, just as it declared
restraint in other aspects of this conflict, like the deployment of
American troops to Ukraine.

How Cyberspace Is Creating Nuclear Risks

[Policymakers and academics are attuned to the cyber risks to nuclear
**command and control**]{.underline}. The practitioner community has
largely focused on U.S. vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.
Scholars, in turn, worry about how [cyber operations could have
**unintended escalatory consequences**]{.underline}. But less attention
has been paid to another likely scenario: the use of cyber operations
for signaling purposes (operations with visible effects that aim to
convey a message to another state) in a nuclear context. [The ambiguity
of cyber operations can sometimes be useful for signaling --- but the
same ambiguity can be **dangerous** during a **nuclear crisis**. The
problem is that civilian leaders in particular, distinct from the
military, are inclined to see cyber attacks as effective signaling
tools.]{.underline}

[Cyber operations could have **nuclear implications**, especially
because modern nuclear command and control systems, like those in Russia
and the United States, are becoming **increasingly dependent** on
digital infrastructure]{.underline}. [Nuclear command, control, and
communications systems, which include early warning, information
collection, and communications capabilities, alert decision-makers to
impending nuclear strikes and also enable leaders to control decisions
about nuclear use (or non-use). But their digital dependencies are
creating opportunities for exploitation using cyber means]{.underline}.
In a 2020 report, the Nuclear Threat Initiative found that "almost 9 out
of 10 planned nuclear modernization programs involve at least some new
digital components or upgrades."

Vulnerabilities inherent in the digital infrastructure that undergird
modern nuclear systems provide opportunities for actors to engage in
cyber espionage --- gaining access to a network or system to steal
information --- or even conduct cyber attacks. Hypothetically, a cyber
power like Russia could conduct a cyber attack against a U.S. early
warning satellite to degrade its functionality. This has become an
urgent concern for practitioners. U.S. Strategic Command, for instance,
is currently working to "operationally harden NC3 systems against cyber
threats." Congress has also gotten involved, requiring the Defense
Department to evaluate the cybersecurity of major weapon systems. And
the Government Accountability Office has published multiple reports
decrying the state of cybersecurity and scope of vulnerabilities of
weapon systems, including elements of the nuclear triad.

From an academic perspective, scholars have investigated how [cyber
operations targeting nuclear systems could **exacerbate escalation
risks**.]{.underline} Focusing on nuclear forces, early research, such
as work by Martin Libicki, was skeptical of the dangers posed by cyber
operations. Nuclear forces were seen as being largely immune from
digital attacks because they were "air gapped," meaning that they were
separated from information technology systems.

However, [as nuclear systems have become increasingly intertwined with
the digital environment --- not to mention the dual-use nature of many
elements of nuclear command, control, and communications systems (like
early warning or position, navigation, and timing satellites) --- the
protection offered by being segregated from the internet is **less
robust**]{.underline}. Jacquelyn Schneider, Benjamin Schechter, and
Rachael Schaffer, for instance, ran a series of wargames demonstrating
that decision-makers in hypothetical crises are likely to use their
cyber exploits against an adversary's nuclear systems. [They found that
this could have negative effects on states' respective nuclear
strategies, especially decisions to pre-delegate **nuclear launch
authority** or **automate nuclear responses**]{.underline}. Erik Gartzke
and Jon Lindsay argue that the clandestine nature of cyber operations
means that one state could secretly gain access to an adversary's
nuclear command, control, and communications systems, giving the former
an information advantage or even creating an incentive for the latter to
use its nuclear weapons out of the fear that it may lose them. [James
Acton notes that the difficulties of distinguishing between cyber
espionage and attack could lead a state to misperceive the intent behind
a cyber operation, generating a similar "**use it or lose it**"

Future Risks

[Even if Russia and the West avoid direct conflict this time, they might
not be so lucky the next]{.underline}. As relations worsen[, future
disruption of critical Western infrastructure by Russian intelligence,
such as the NotPetya and Olympic Destroyer attacks, are less likely to
be viewed as mere crimes. Repeated crises bordering on war may **further
erode** the **tacit agreements** and **relative restraint** of quieter
times. After repeated iterations of intensifying cyber operations, both
Russia and the West may feel their backs to the wall with few options
left other than **military force** when the next crisis --- physical or
cyber --- emerges]{.underline}. Under extreme conditions, some of the
same characteristics that lead cyber capabilities to be a pressure
release might have the opposite effect, a mechanism that Bob Jervis and
I have described as the Escalation Inversion.

[If Putin believes a direct conflict with NATO is **likely** and expects
its adversaries to **take measures to reduce vulnerabilities**, he could
conclude that the best possibility for success is to launch a **massive
preemptive cyber attack**.]{.underline} Since the U.S. military may seem
otherwise unbeatable, this may lead Russia to "compensate with audacity
in order to redress the balance." [The more the United States **brags
about its overwhelming offensive cyber advantage**, but frets over weak
defenses, the more any adversary might **feel the need to target** the
United States as early and as hard as possible.]{.underline}

[If Russia fears war with the United States may happen on Saturday, it
might feel the need to get in its cyber punches on Friday]{.underline}.
If the United States thinks the same, it may need to start on Thursday.
[Cyber capabilities may be to **World War III** as mobilization
timelines were to World War I.]{.underline}

[Since a cyber sucker punch may also seem less escalatory, adversaries
could be **tempted to take risks** they would not
otherwise]{.underline}. In this situation, [the sense that cyber is a
pressure-release valve becomes **positively dangerous**]{.underline}:
[If the system is seen to be stable, then there is less reason to act
with restraint, thereby making it less stable]{.underline}. Fortunately,
the good news is leading U.S. policymakers appear attuned to this risk.

#### The plan violates intelligence norms --- causes adversaries to think they're being attacked.

Escalation and the dominant intelligence norm

[The large overlap between intelligence collection and attack in
cyberspace makes it difficult to send **clear signals** to adversaries,
in terms of either capabilities or intentions]{.underline}. [When a
foreign entity is moving around in a network, is it then about to start
a **military operation?**]{.underline} [Is the activity part of a
reconnaissance mission? Is it political or economic espionage? Is it
active defence?]{.underline} The difficulty of answering these questions
has created much nervousness among cyber-conflict experts. Ben Buchanan,
for example, [has shown how defensive hacking or intelligence-gathering
in cyberspace is **easily misinterpreted** as aggressive
behaviou]{.underline}r.66 [Why, then, have we not experienced serious
**misinterpretation** and **escalation** in cyberspace?]{.underline}

[One way to explain this is through the existence and dominance of a
largely unspoken but **widely accepted** norm]{.underline}. [For
decades, the **predominant actors** in cyberspace have been
**intelligence agencies**; and the norms that characterize interactions
between intelligence agencies are not primarily concerned with military
concepts such as conflict escalation and deterrenc]{.underline}e.67 In
the world of intelligence agencies, success is not about keeping a
distance between oneself and the adversary by signalling one\'s
intentions and capabilities. It is about being able to outmanoeuvre
adversaries in a space of constant contact.68 There are always risks,
and the work usually takes place in legal grey zones where a clear
distinction between war and peace is not the guiding principle. This is
an arena where the opportunity to annoy, cheat and delay opponents is
taken when it arises. [In short, espionage and counter-espionage **do
not fit well with** the thorough military operational planning that
characterizes **NATO operations**]{.underline}. Intelligence operations,
on the other hand, fit perfectly with a dynamic cyberspace where
anonymity is easy to achieve and uncertainty a constant condition.69
[The states that embrace cyberspace as a domain where the intelligence
norm dominates are able to use a broader array of tools to pursue or
respond to various foreign political objectives than only those that
relate to military operations.]{.underline}

In its 2018 'vision', [the US Cyber Command **built implicitly** on the
dominant **intelligence norm**]{.underline}. Here, the objective is to
become more agile and act as close to the adversary as possible ('defend
forward').70 [The United States considers 'constant contact' and
'persistent engagement' as the necessary guiding principles to achieve
superiority in cyberspace and to take full advantage of the broader
potential for pursuing its political objectives through
cyberspace.]{.underline} During the 2018 US midterm elections, for
example, the US Cyber Command worked closely with the NSA to disrupt
servers operated by the Russian Internet Research Agency aiming to
spread fake news and stir up tension in the United States.71 More
recently, the US Cyber Command responded with various cyber effects
against Iran after the Iranian Revolutionary Guards apparently placed
mines on ships in the Strait of Hormuz.72 These practices illustrate
that, for the United States, cyber effects provide political options
when one does not want to escalate existing tensions into military
confrontation. Defensive coordination between allies through CYOC
supports such defensive use of cyber effects, increasing the possibility
that US Cyber Command will be allowed to 'defend forward' and work
persistently through allied networks.73 A more cyber-active NATO,
however, risks being counterproductive to the ambition to 'defend
forward' through allied networks.

[Unintended conflict escalation from ongoing cyber activity is mainly a
risk if military analysts---in a strategic environment with heightened
attention to military confrontation---**ignore the dominant intelligence
norm**]{.underline}. [If that happens, it becomes more likely that
'persistent engagement' and active cyber defence will be misinterpreted
as **military preparation**, **armament** or the **initial phase of an
attack**]{.underline}. [**If NATO,** an organization that has publicly
returned to its original raison d\'être of deterrence and collective
defence, becomes the entity that **coordinates cyber effects** below the
threshold of armed conflict, then the likelihood increases that Russia
misinterprets these effects as **escalatory** and **acts
accordingly**]{.underline}. In other words, [a **more active NATO** in
the current strategic environment **increases the risk** that the
existing intelligence norm will be **undermined** and replaced by a
**more militarized norm**.]{.underline}

#### Broader cyberwar is likely.

Security Studies, 2019 ("Cyber Command's Strategy Risks Friction With
Allies," *Lawfare,* May 28^th^, Available Online at

[Much has been written about the fundamental changes in U.S. cyber
strategy]{.underline}. U.S. Cyber Command's vision of "persistent
engagement" and the Department of Defense's new strategy of "defend
forward" have, in particular, [led to numerous critical remarks about
the **risks of escalation** between the U.S. and its main adversaries in
**cyberspace**.]{.underline}

These debates are worth continuing, including about [what the change in
strategy means for establishing norms in]{.underline}
cyberspace[.]{.underline} But commentators have so far ignored a key
dimension: [The strategy's **main implications** may not reside in how
it changes the dynamics between the U.S. and its adversaries but,
instead, in how it affects **broader alliance
relationships**]{.underline}, especially beyond the Five Eyes
(Australia, Canada, the U.K., the U.S. and New Zealand). U[.S. Cyber
Command's mission to cause **friction** in adversaries' freedom of
maneuver in cyberspace may end up causing **significant friction** in
allies' trust and confidence---and adversaries may be able to **exploit
that**.]{.underline}

### 2NC \-\-- Terminal Impact

#### Putin won't back down --- guarantees nuclear escalation.

International Security Studies at the Wilson Center, former Adjunct
Professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown University, PhD

Balance of Terror" Revisited," *Wilson Center,* May 3^rd^, Available

Since the Cuban Missile Crisis, assured retaliation---eliminating
incentives for a surprise first strike---has been the sine qua non of
strategic stability. The risk for crisis stability is that arms race
instability could revive those incentives, making the deterrent
relationships more "delicate." [With the advent of new technologies,
**escalation during a crisis** could occur in a non-traditional
domain---cyber or space---and could **misleadingly be viewed** as
non-escalatory because it would be non-kinetic]{.underline}. [But an
inadvertent **escalatory spiral** could be set off by a Russian
cyberattack to interfere with U.S. communications with its nuclear
systems or an attack on reconnaissance satellites to blind the United
States.]{.underline} Hints of that potentiality are already manifest:
Russia conducted an anti-satellite missile test last November and,
during the Ukraine war, has carried out extensive cyberattacks, often in
coordination with its battlefield operations.

[In the Ukraine war, as during the Cuban Missile Crisis, inadvertent
escalation remains a **major risk.**]{.underline} [Putin is a risk-taker
(whose agents used a military-grade nerve agent in a 2018 assassination
attempt on a Russian military defector in Britain) and he is **prone to
miscalculation**]{.underline}. His assumptions going in to
Ukraine---that the conflict would be short and decisive, that the
Zelensky government would fold quickly, and that the West would be
feckless in its disunity---were all miscalculations that ironically led
many Western officials and analysts to conclude that he would threaten
but not invade.

Given Putin's propensity for risk-taking and miscalculation, the Biden
administration is exploring scenarios in which [Russian military
"setbacks" and "desperation" (as CIA Director Burns' warned) lead to the
use of **chemical** or **nuclear weapons**.]{.underline} Under what U.S.
officials describe as Russia's "escalate-to-deescalate" strategy, [Putin
might **double down** in the face of adversity by employing a single
weapon for its demonstration effect]{.underline}---to shock the
Ukrainian and Western leaderships into acceding to terms favorable to
the Kremlin. While the Biden administration has not laid down an
explicit deterrent marker specifying the U.S. response, a senior
official warned that [any Russian use of nuclear weapons would mean
"**all bets are off**"---a tacit signal that such a violation of the
nuclear taboo could move the United States and NATO to become **directly
involved** in the war]{.underline}. The Biden administration could
strengthen that deterrent message, as Stanford Professor of Political
Science Scott Sagan has recommended, by communicating directly to the
Russian military that an order from Putin to use a nuclear weapon in
Ukraine would be illegal, a violation of the Geneva Conventions, and
should not be obeyed.

[The challenges of crisis stability to prevent escalation are
**immediate** and **urgent**]{.underline} even as the near-term
prospects for a resolution of the Ukraine war appear remote. The U.S.
policy focus should be on preventing inadvertent escalation. Key to that
imperative is maintaining an open line of communications with Russia's
military leadership. As a disquieting indicator of the virulent
relations between Moscow and Washington, Russia has rebuffed calls from
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to their counterparts.

### 1NC \-\-- Deconfliction Turn

#### The plan causes cyber deconfliction --- that makes effective [OCOs impossible]{.underline} AND [ruins NATO cohesion]{.underline} --- turns both advantages.

**Jacobsen 21** --- Jeppe T. Jacobsen, Visiting Scholar at New York
University, former Cyber Coordinator at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of Denmark, Ph.D. candidate at the Danish Institute for International
Studies and the Center for War Studies at the University of Southern

<https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/97/3/703/6205395?login=true>)

Confliction---the issue of secrecy

[The third challenge to the integration of cyber effects in NATO
operations relates to a well-known military concept, deconfliction. The
coordination by allies and military units of their efforts to avoid
confliction]{.underline}, between for example an air operation and a
special forces operation in the same area, is a central element in every
military campaign. Deconfliction is all about openness and communication
between allied partners. [But in cyberspace, deconfliction comes with
**several difficulties**]{.underline}. At the core of these difficulties
is the [fact that the tools and techniques that produce cyber
effects---which are often also used and heavily depended on for
intelligence collection---are **developed in secret** and **must stay
secret** until the effect is achieved.]{.underline} [If the IT
vulnerabilities and exploits are known, vendors or adversaries can fix
or replace the software and thereby render the effect **impossible to
achieve**]{.underline}.39 In an alliance not known for sufficient mutual
trust among members to share intelligence,40 [there is **little
indication** that allies will become more open about the cyber tools and
techniques they currently have at their disposal]{.underline}. [The
request-based model is the result of that lack of trust]{.underline}.
[And the unwillingness to share cyber intelligence **seriously
challenges** NATO\'s ambition to use CYOC to facilitate
**information-sharing** to increase situational awareness and thereby
achieve the '**cyber readiness'** and '**cyber
resiliency'**]{.underline} that NATO Deputy Secretary-General Mircea
Geoană hopes to attain.41

Furthermore, [**lack of coordination** and discussion about the use of
military cyber capabilities, both internally in each state and among
allies, can have **negative implications** for **intelligence
activities** and **general network security**]{.underline}. A
conventional military decision to deliver cyber effects is rarely
concerned with maintaining access and staying secret after an effect is
achieved[. Even though it is customary to try to obscure the
vulnerabilities that are being exploited, it is difficult to ensure that
those operating the targeted system or third-party network analysts do
not identify and fix the vulnerabilities in, for example, commercial
products used all over the world]{.underline}. Thus, [military plans to
engage other state entities need to weigh the benefit of delivering
cyber effects against the **risk of losing intelligence capacity**, as
well as the risk that other actors (allies, corporations, adversaries,
criminals, etc.) will use the **same exploits** against
oneself.]{.underline} In other words, [there is a **conflict of
interest** between attack, intelligence collection and internal defence
in **each NATO member state**.]{.underline}42 The desire of the US Cyber
Command to become more independent from the National Security Agency
(NSA) is precisely an attempt to gain a stronger voice when the US
government assesses whether a vulnerability should be disclosed to
vendors, retained for intelligence purposes or used to deliver 'loud'
cyber effects.43

[The risk of confliction among allies arises from the fact that a
similar assessment procedure **does not exist** across
NATO]{.underline}. As conversations with several national
representatives at the CDC reveal, [such a procedure is unlikely to be
agreed upon owing to the different perspectives on offence, defence and
espionage in cyberspace currently prevailing among member
states]{.underline}.44 If the Netherlands, for example, offers to
deliver a 'loud' cyber effect in a NATO operation, British or American
intelligence operations could end up being disturbed because they rely
on the same vulnerabilities which---when used in military
operations---risk being exposed and subsequently fixed.45 When deploying
'loud' cyber effects, malicious actors such as criminals are also given
the opportunity to identify and exploit the same vulnerabilities in
unpatched systems in allied countries. The ransomware incidents known as
WannaCry and NotPetya are examples of the damage that can emerge from
government exploits becoming publicly available---even though the
specific vulnerabilities were already patched by Microsoft and updates
released to supported systems.46

In short, [there is a dilemma both **internally**, between intelligence
agencies and the military, and **externally, between allies**. While it
is difficult to do much about the latter, the internal power dynamics in
most states, with the intelligence agencies as the primary cyber actors,
are likely to limit the willingness of most states to deliver military
cyber effects---whether offensive or defensive---when CYOC makes
requests]{.underline}. They also limit the willingness to share cyber
threat information across the alliance through CYOC.

This section has pointed to three characteristics about cyberspace that
limit the integration of cyber effects in NATO operations. [In a complex
and constantly changing cyberspace, it continues to be difficult to
develop and maintain sophisticated exploits for targeted cyber effects.
This is especially the case if the cyber effects are requested for a
specific time and place in order to guarantee operational success, and
if they simultaneously have to be verifiable and conform to
international legal principles.]{.underline} [Neither the member states,
which face an internal dilemma between attack, intelligence collection
and defence in cyberspace, nor the NATO commander, who will prefer to
control the capabilities used, are likely to feel sufficiently confident
about the targeted or highly integrated cyber effects to choose that
option if other capabilities are available.]{.underline}

### 2NC \-\-- Deconfliction Turn

#### Info-sharing ruins any potential benefits of OCOs.

Perspective," *CCDCOE*, Available Online at
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2020/12/Cyber-Threats-and-NATO-2030_Horizon-Scanning-and-Analysis.pdf)

Policy differences exacerbate conceptual ones. [Allies differ in their
**policy** and **legal constraints**, **strategic cultures**, **threat
perception**, **resources**, **planning** and **budgetary cycles** and
**forces**]{.underline} (Sondhaus, 2006). [While solidarity ultimately
remains NATO's strongest asset, these differences create seams that
**adversaries can exploit**]{.underline}. [This is especially so with
cyberspace, where there is more sensitivity and less commonality to
emerging national approaches than in more established domains, and to
MDO, which is inherently predicated on integration and
interoperability]{.underline} (Sharpy, 2020).

[**Information sharing** is **especially problematic** for the **cyber
dimension** of MDO, with Allies reticent to share details of their
capabilities across NATO given security concerns and political
sensitivities]{.underline}. [The issue of permissions is also a
'**significant challenge** in the development of cyber capabilities',
especially where reconnaissance on Allied soil and networks is required
to detect hostile cyber activity]{.underline} (Watling & Roper, 2019).
[Nations also have **differing policy**, **legal** and **ethical
stances** on key technologies]{.underline} on which MDO relies. [This
includes the use of offensive cyber capabilities or basing of hypersonic
missiles or longrange penetrating fires in Europe, which some fear could
be destabilising and escalatory]{.underline} (Quintin & Vanholme, 2020).
[NATO similarly lacks a common approach to governance and use of AI,
autonomy and automation, all envisaged as essential enablers for JADC2
(Williams, 2020). This affects the levels of autonomy (with the human
in, on or out of the loop) used for sensor data fusion and
decision-making]{.underline}, or to deliver effects using uncrewed
platforms, automated cyber systems and human-machine teaming (Scharre,
2018).

In considering cooperation and burden-sharing, [Allies face **several
dilemmas** depending on their ambitions and resources for both
cyberspace and MDO.]{.underline} The US must overcome domestic
inter-service rivalries and decide how to integrate partners, including
whether it can accept a multinational vision of MDO that is not imposed
on smaller allies---or excludes them entirely, at NATO's expense---but
rather is genuinely collaborative (Watling & Roper, 2019). [Larger
European nations face the dilemma of whether to buy into a US-led
architecture and system-of-systems with implications for freedom of
action, data-sharing and procurement choices, or shoulder the costs of
sovereign or multinational alternatives]{.underline}.11 They also face
choices over how best to contribute to multinational MDO: whether to
aspire to full-spectrum capabilities to allow sovereign action and offer
redundancy to Allies' capabilities or to specialise in certain domains
(e.g. cyber) to offer niche capability and buy leverage with the US and
NATO by making themselves indispensable. [Smaller nations must decide
how to influence larger Allies and NATO, and what to do if they lack
cyber capabilities (or others deemed central to MDO, e.g. long-range
fires) or their forces are too small to operate or gain MDO experience
at echelons above brigade (Watling & Roper, 2019).]{.underline}

[The economic fallout of COVID-19 also raises renewed questions about
**affordability** and the extent to which Allies are **willing** and
**able** to invest in new cyber capabilities]{.underline}---though some
may see these as cost-efficient alternatives to land, air or maritime
forces---and how they time investments in ambitious transformation
programmes such as MDO (Clark, 2020). Timing presents both threats and
opportunities from a cyber perspective. Rapid, hasty transformation
risks undermining NATO cohesion and interoperability or creating
vulnerabilities in JADC2 systems with immature cyber defences (Donaldson
& Sciarini, 2019b). Conversely, overly cautious change risks ceding
ground to adversaries such as Russia and China which are investing
heavily in asymmetric means, including offensive cyber capabilities, to
gain an information advantage over NATO (Kilcullen, 2020).

#### NATO will spread info to the private sector --- that causes OCOs to fail.

**Black and Lynch 20** --- James Black, Research Coordinator at RAND,
MSc in International Security from Sciences Po, LSE in History from the
University of Cambridge, and Alice Lynch, Former Defense and Security
Analyst at RAND, M.A. in Applied Security Strategy from the University

Perspective," *CCDCOE*, Available Online at
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2020/12/Cyber-Threats-and-NATO-2030_Horizon-Scanning-and-Analysis.pdf)

Problematically, authorities associated with using cyber capabilities
are typically held at the strategic and national level; how tactical or
operational commanders might call upon cyber means as part of future MDO
remains unclear (Nettis, 2020). [Responsibilities for cyberspace also
often fall at least partly to **civilian agencies**, adding the
complexity of **cross-government cooperation**. The private sector's
role developing and applying technologies in the cyber domain (and,
increasingly, space) also **necessitates that NATO work more closely
with industry**, academia and others than for land, maritime or air
operations (Ablon et al., 2019). This presents **operational**,
**policy** and **legal difficulties** for C2, and cybersecurity
challenges associated with reliance on industry-owned
network]{.underline}s, though Allies continue to evolve novel mechanisms
for partnering with industry to address cyber threats (Carr, 2016).

[There is also the question of **tempo**: how to synchronise operations
in cyberspace with the delivery of effects in other domain]{.underline}s
(Reilly, 2020). [Though cyber attacks might initiate in a moment, the
underlying tools and exploits may take **years to develop** and the lead
times and scale of their eventual effect may be difficult to predict or
measure given the difficulties with battle damage assessment in
cyberspace or the EMS]{.underline} (Patrikarakos, 2017; US Joint Staff,
2019). Similarly, [commanders may **lack awareness** or
**understanding** of available cyber instruments and their limitations
and effects compared to more familiar weapons in the physical domains,
limiting inclusion in joint planning and decision-making]{.underline}
(Carbonell, 2017).

### AT \-\-- Ukraine Cyberwar Now

#### Russia cyber efforts are low-level currently, but the plan changes the calculus.

**Kallberg 22** --- Jan Kallberg, Assistant Professor at the United
States Military Academy at West Point, Research Scientist at the Army
Cyber Institute at West Point, PhD in Public Affairs and M.A. in
Political Science from the University of Texas, LLM from Stockholm
University, 2022 ("Ukraine: Russia will not waste offensive cyber
weapons," *The Cyberwire,* March 14^th^, Available Online at
<https://thecyberwire.com/stories/75ca5313b59045ccbcbfc7d3b9e5d207/ukraine-russia-will-not-waste-offensive-cyber-weapons>)

When Russia's strategic calculus would dictate major cyber attacks.

[Russia will use advanced strategic cyber at **well-defined** critical
junctures]{.underline}. For example, as a conflict in Europe unfolded
and dragged in NATO, [Russian forces would seek to delay the entry of
major US forces through cyber attacks against railways, ports, and
electric facilities along the route to the port of
embarkation]{.underline}. If US forces can be delayed by one week, that
is one week of a prolonged time window in Europe before the main US
force arrived, and would enable the submarines of the Northern Fleet to
be positioned in the Atlantic. Strategic cyber supports strategic intent
and actions.

[All cyber-attacks are not the same, and just because an attack
originates from Russia doesn\'t mean it is directed by strategic
intent]{.underline}. Naturally, the Russian regime would allow cyber
vandalism and cybercrime against the West to run rampant, because these
are ways of striking the adversary. [But these low-end activities do not
represent the Russian military complex's cyber capabilities, nor do they
reflect the Russian leadership's strategic intent.]{.underline}

[The recent cyberattacks in Ukraine have been **unsophisticated** and
have had close to no **strategic impact**.]{.underline} [The distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) cyber-attacks are **low-end efforts**, a
nuisance that most corporations already have systems to
mitigate]{.underline}. [Such DDoS attacks will not bring down a country
or force it to submit to foreign will]{.underline}. Such low-end attacks
don't represent advanced offensive cyber weapons: the DDoS attacks are
limited impact cyber vandalism. Advanced offensive cyber weapons
destroy, degrade, and disrupt systems, eradicate trust and pollute data
integrity. DDoS and website defacements are not even close to this in
their effects. By making DDoS attacks, whether it's the state that
carried them out or a group of college students in support of Kremlin
policy, Russia has not shown the extent of its offensive cyber
capability.

The invasion of Ukraine is not the major peer-to-peer conflict that is
the central Russian concern. [The Russians have tailored their advanced
cyber capabilities to directly impact a more significant geopolitical
conflict, one with NATO or China.]{.underline} Creating a national
offensive cyber force is a decades-long investment in training,
toolmaking, reconnaissance of possible avenues of approach, and
detection of vulnerabilities[. If Russia showcased its full range of
advanced offensive cyber capabilities against Ukraine, the Russian
tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) would be
compromised]{.underline}. NATO and other neighboring nations, including
China and Iran, would know the extent of Russian capabilities and have
effective insight into Russia's modus operandi.

From a Russian point of view, [if a potential adversary **understood
Russian offensive cyber operations'** tactics, techniques, and
procedures, strategic surprise **would evaporate**, and the Russian
cyber force would **lose the initiative** in a more strategically
significant future conflict]{.underline}.

Understanding the Russian point of view is essential, because it is the
Russians who conduct their offensive actions. This might sound like
stating the obvious, but currently, the prevailing conventional wisdom
is a Western think-tank-driven context, which in my opinion, is
inaccurate. [There is nothing for the Russians to strategically gain by
unleashing their full advanced cyber arsenal against Ukraine or NATO at
this juncture. In an open conflict between Russia and NATO the Russian
calculation would be different and justify use of advanced cyber
capabilities.]{.underline}

#### Cyberwar is currently a last resort for Russia.

**Kallberg 22** --- Jan Kallberg, Assistant Professor at the United
States Military Academy at West Point, Research Scientist at the Army
Cyber Institute at West Point, PhD in Public Affairs and M.A. in
Political Science from the University of Texas, LLM from Stockholm
University, 2022 ("Ukraine: Russia will not waste offensive cyber

<https://thecyberwire.com/stories/75ca5313b59045ccbcbfc7d3b9e5d207/ukraine-russia-will-not-waste-offensive-cyber-weapons>)

[Cyberattacks, in this war, are a **last resort**]{.underline}, not an
opening gambit.

[The lingering threat of offensive cyber operations is Putin's **last
card** -- together with nukes.]{.underline} [There is no rational reason
that Putin's Russia would play the offensive cyber card without some
**reasonable prospect** of **geopolitical gain**.]{.underline}

Russia has achieved an operational stalemate with limited progress in
its invasion of Ukraine, but [unleashing its advanced cyber capabilities
at **this stage** against Western targets will not solve the
war.]{.underline} Such attacks will only increase the support for
Ukraine without bringing Russia any appreciable battlefield advantage

[Western commentaries predicting a Russian cyber onslaught rests upon a
general assumption that sees advanced offensive cyber capabilities as
being replaceable once used]{.underline}. . In reality, [this assumption
is **illogical**: there is no hidden cyber armory from which new weapons
can be fetched and reloaded for continued cyber
bombardment]{.underline}. Exploits, once used, are often parried
quickly, and they can't then be expected to have the same effect they
had when first unleashed.

Therefore, [Russia is **unlikely to waste** its advanced offensive cyber
arsenal on a conflict where there is no value to a cyberattack that
couldn't already be accomplished by kinetic attack]{.underline}: air
strikes, Kalibr cruise missiles, and indirect fire. Each advanced and
sophisticated offensive cyber weapon represents an investment that, in
some cases, is a one-shot ability to exploit a vulnerability. [Striking
targets in America and within NATO utilizing advanced offensive cyber
weapons, without any other goal than to degrade and disrupt, is wasting
offensive cyber power.]{.underline}

#### The current cyberattacks are categorically distinct from larger cyberwar.

What are the implications of this for the current Ukraine crisis? [Thus
far, while cyber operations have been used on both sides of the
conflict, they have **not played a decisive role** on the
battlefield.]{.underline} [So far, the United States has been focused on
providing cyber defense support to Ukraine and NATO, reportedly to
include dispatching Cyber Command's cyber mission teams to Eastern
Europe, as well as seeking to deter potential Russian cyber retaliation
in response to U.S. and Western sanctions, especially attacks on U.S.
critical infrastructure]{.underline}.

However, [if the nuclear dimension of the crisis becomes more acute,
policymakers may be tempted to turn to cyber operations to signal
resolve to deter Russia in the nuclear domain]{.underline}. Such an
approach could be seen as particularly appealing precisely because cyber
operations are not kinetic and, therefore, less dangerous than other
military moves. [But this could have the inverse effect of making
**nuclear escalation**, rather than deterrence, **more likely**, for the
following reasons.]{.underline}

In 2020, [Russia clarified its nuclear declaratory policy to state that
Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons under a range of
contingencies, including an adversary attack]{.underline} against
"critical governmental or military sites of the Russian Federation,
disruption of which would undermine nuclear forces' response actions."
Cynthia Roberts has suggested that [this particular scenario "likely
include\[s\] cyber attacks against command and control infrastructure
and/or attempted leadership decapitation.]{.underline}" Similarly,
Dmitry Stefanovich wrote that ["\[t\]here is a wide consensus within the
Russian expert community that this also includes possible cyber threats
as well as other non-nuclear dangers."]{.underline} Interestingly,
Russia's declaratory policy contains parallels to the implicit link
between cyber attacks and nuclear use contained in the 2018 U.S. Nuclear
Posture Review. [That document notes that the United States would
consider using nuclear weapons under "extreme circumstances," including
"significant non-nuclear strategic attacks ... \[such as\] attacks on
U.S. or allied nuclear forces, their command and control, or warning and
attack assessment capabilities."]{.underline}

Therefore, [a hypothetical attempt by the United States to conduct a
cyber operation against Russian nuclear command, control, and
communication systems for signaling purposes, such as to demonstrate
resolve or convey a desire to deter the use of nuclear weapons could in
practice make their use more likely]{.underline}. Unlike most cyber
operations, which rely on secrecy, signals are meant to be seen. And to
be sufficiently credible, this kind of cyber operation would have to
demonstrate an ability to cause a meaningful effect against Russia's
nuclear systems, rather than a low-cost, unsophisticated cyber
operation. [Therefore, assuming such an attack were feasible, the
chances are greater in this scenario that Russia could interpret U.S.
cyber signals as an attack against its critical military
systems.]{.underline}

The problem is that, more often than not, cyber operations are ambiguous
[signals. There is evidence that states can use cyber operations under
some (narrow) conditions to signal a desire to de-escalate international
crises. But these findings do not extend well to nuclear crises where
clarity, rather than uncertainty, is important for
stability]{.underline}. The use of cyber operations to defuse crises
have involved cyber signaling short of war, not during an ongoing
conventional conflict involving nuclear powers. And they have not
involved cyber operations targeting a state's nuclear command and
control where states, like Russia, have already staked out declaratory
policies. [Moreover, states are still at a nascent stage in developing
shared indices to inform assessments of intent in cyberspace, especially
when it comes to cyber operations in nuclear crises.]{.underline}

Therefore, [even if Russia would not take the cataclysmic step of
escalating to the first use of nuclear weapons in response to a U.S.
cyber operation, it could misinterpret U.S. signaling efforts and take
measures to make nuclear use]{.underline} easier (such as making
warheads operational, dispersing forces, pre-delegating authority, or
increasing automaticity). [These readiness measures could increase the
chances of **inadvertent** or even **accidental
escalation**.]{.underline}
