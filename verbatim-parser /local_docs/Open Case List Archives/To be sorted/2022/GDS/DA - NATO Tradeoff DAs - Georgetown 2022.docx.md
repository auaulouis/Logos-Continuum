The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's ([NATO's]{.underline}) [summit
in Madrid]{.underline} on June 29 and 30 [comes at a consequential
moment for the Alliance]{.underline}. [Russia's unprovoked second
invasion of Ukraine,]{.underline} the ensuing war that has resulted in
the deaths of at least 4,000 Ukrainian civilians,1 and the displacement
of over 14 million people [is]{.underline} very likely [a fulcrum in
history]{.underline}. The [transatlantic]{.underline} [community will
not return to]{.underline} the [pre-invasion relations with
Russia]{.underline} and must plan accordingly. As the shock of Russia's
invasion on February 24 has evolved into the realization that the war is
likely to grind on, the transatlantic community must steel itself for
the long haul.

For [NATO]{.underline}, the [Madrid Summit is]{.underline} an
[opportunity to expand upon]{.underline} the initiatives announced at
the Brussels Summit in April, fulfilling the [immediate **need for
further deterrence measures**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
[Eastern]{.underline} [Europe with]{.underline} a [clear-eyed
resolve]{.underline}, [while putting in place plans to ensure that NATO
has]{.underline} the [capabilities to]{.underline} continue
[tackl]{.underline}ing [challenges over the long term]{.underline}.
While the [summit provides]{.underline} a **[historic
opportunity]{.underline}**, the danger is that the summit will merely
repackage half measures---which Russia would see as a sign of weakness,
inviting further aggression. The U.S. must ensure that the Madrid Summit
fulfills its potential. For the United States, a stable, secure Europe
is firmly in U.S. national interest, and a [stable and secure Europe
begins and ends with a vigorous NATO capable of deterring Russian
aggression]{.underline} against its member states.

The past few months have underscored the reality that, while many
European nations have stepped up, there is no substitute for U.S.
leadership within NATO. As such, the U.S. should ensure that NATO
implements measures that bolster deterrence immediately while laying the
groundwork for retaining strength in the long term through robust
defense investment. The U.S. should propel its allies toward a wholesale
recommitment to collective defense and all that entails: robust, lasting
commitments to defense spending, moving beyond tripwire forces in
Eastern European member states toward a force posture of deterrence with
broad participation across the Alliance; swift consideration of Finland
and Sweden in NATO; and support for member states that are aiding
Ukrainian forces.

In the U.S. National Interest: A Robust NATO

For economic, political, and security reasons, the U.S. maintains a
central interest in the peace and security of the European continent.
While Russia's second invasion of Ukraine has proven profoundly
destabilizing, the core mission of NATO, to deter aggression against
member states, remains intact, and Russia has thus far shied away from
any direct military action against a NATO member state. [To avoid
further miscalculations]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[lessen]{.underline} the [chance]{.underline} that Vladimir [Putin
strikes a NATO member]{.underline}, the [Alliance must bolster its
deterrence posture]{.underline}, **[starting with fleshing out the
promises]{.underline}** of the Brussel Summit [to put in place new
forces to deter Russian aggression]{.underline} and, if necessary,
defeat an invasion of a NATO country.

In response to Russia's first invasion of Ukraine in 2014,
[NATO]{.underline} created an Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) of four
multinational battalions in each of the Baltic states and Poland. While
the force size in each battalion, typically 1,000 to 1,500 troops, is
small, the [idea]{.underline} was [to deploy a multintional force as a
signal of resolve]{.underline} as well as a so-called tripwire to ensure
that, should Russia invade, the battalion would not only slow down any
advance but also provide critical political insurance that member states
contributing troops would literally have skin (or, more accurately,
lives) in the game to galvanize their sustained involvement in the
conflict. This spring in Brussels, the Alliance announced the creation
of four additional battalions, one each stationed in Bulgaria, Hungary,
Romania, and Slovakia. While the Alliance's decision to create
additional battalions is helpful, it is clear that a small tripwire
force [does not provide the deterrence effect that a larger
force]{.underline}, **[complete with enablers, such as air
defenses]{.underline}**, could. Recently, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz
backed the calls of Lithuanian officials (where Germany leads the EFP
battalion) to create a brigade-size presence (usually 3,000 to 5,000
troops).2

**The aff [overcommits]{.underline} NATO to [broad info-sharing
responsibilities]{.underline}, which [trades off]{.underline} with a
focus on [collective defense]{.underline}.**

If and when the Biden team embarks on its grand European tour, it seems
virtually certain that, beyond the expressions of gratitude for
America's "return" that will surely follow them wherever they go, the
delegation can expect to be met with a lengthy list of items requiring
their immediate attention. Moreover, appeals for Washington's assistance
are likely to differ from capital to capital, with [each NATO ally
arguing]{.underline} that [their particular issue or concern
represents]{.underline} the [most pressing challenge]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} therefore [requires]{.underline} the most attention
and [resources]{.underline}. In Warsaw and the capitals of the Baltic
states, the U.S. delegation will hear that, despite a new U.S.
rotational troop deployment, a revanchist Russia necessitates additional
NATO (but especially U.S.) military commitments along the Eastern flank
of the alliance. In Rome, Athens, and Madrid, U.S. policymakers will
learn that the Mediterranean countries represent the "soft underbelly"
of NATO and that the alliance must do more to project stability along
its southern arc of instability. In Ankara, the message will be one of
anger directed at what the Erdogan government perceives as NATO's
collective failure to support Turkish actions in Syria and elsewhere. In
Paris, the message for the U.S. delegation will be that the alliance
must strengthen its counter-terrorism efforts in the Middle East and
North Africa, while in Berlin the focus will be on reforming NATO's
nuclear posture and salvaging expiring arms-control agreements.
Meanwhile, securing the Arctic and halting the effects of climate change
will be at the top of the agenda in Copenhagen and Oslo.

In short, [wherever]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} presidential
delegation [goes]{.underline}, [it will be met with
requests]{.underline} that Washington --- and with it, [the NATO
alliance]{.underline} --- **[prioritize]{.underline}**
**[everything]{.underline}**, thereby [fulfilling]{.underline} the old
[adage that]{.underline}, "**[When everything is a priority, nothing is
a priority]{.underline}**." Given the precarious state of international
relations today, the temptation to do more is understandably strong. It
is easy to understand why, in the present climate of global instability,
calls for the transatlantic alliance to reinforce and strengthen its
existing commitments while simultaneously adding new mandates, missions,
and programs are popular. [Rather than]{.underline} [adding more items
to its]{.underline} **[already crowded agenda]{.underline}**, however,
the [time has come for]{.underline} not just the United States but also
[NATO to consider **doing less but**]{.underline} doing it
**[better]{.underline}**.

When More Is Less, and Less Is More

For an alliance that has long prided itself on its commonality of
purpose and interests, the truth is that NATO is in danger of losing
both. [On paper]{.underline} and in public, the [members]{.underline}
still [agree]{.underline} the [core purpose of]{.underline} the
71-year-old [alliance is deterrence and defense]{.underline} of the
North Atlantic region. When internal disagreements are aired publicly,
other allies are quick to dispel reports of rifts by pointing out that
differences of opinion are nothing new. [But]{.underline}
[unlike]{.underline} during the [Cold War]{.underline}, when a single
adversary occupied all of the alliance's attention, [today's security
environment]{.underline} --- as the allies routinely remind each other
--- [is multifaceted]{.underline} and complex. In an effort to address
members' often disparate security requirements, [NATO]{.underline} has
[taken on additional tasks over]{.underline} the [past three
decades]{.underline} almost as quickly as it has taken on additional
members. The [NATO-ization of every security challenge]{.underline} has
meant that issues once considered the purview of individual nations or
other international organizations --- such as [migration]{.underline},
[terrorism]{.underline}, and [foreign security]{.underline} force
assistance --- are now [lumped onto NATO's agenda]{.underline}
[under]{.underline} the [guise of fulfilling its ambitious]{.underline}
(and potentially limitless) post-Cold War [mandate of "projecting
stability]{.underline}."

For far too long now, [alliance leaders]{.underline} have tasked the
NATO military infrastructure with a seemingly impossible undertaking:
[weighing down]{.underline} the military [organization with]{.underline}
new responsibilities like [peacekeeping and
counter-terrorism]{.underline} [while]{.underline} simultaneously
[allowing members to]{.underline} **[shirk on
contributing]{.underline}** the **[resources]{.underline}** required to
fulfill old and new alliance missions. To date, much of the criticism
surrounding [NATO's current strategic deadlock]{.underline} has [focused
on]{.underline} the **[resource]{.underline}** **[issue]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} the **[strains]{.underline}** [caused by uneven
burden-sharing]{.underline} within the alliance. Far less attention has
been paid to the first part of the "ends-means-ways" formulation of
strategy, namely NATO's original purpose. While addressing "means" and
"ways" are crucial elements in any strategic enterprise, it is past time
the Allies got around to focusing on NATO's strategic ends once more.

[Confronting NATO's present strategic dilemma]{.underline} will require
looking beyond existing strategic documents like the 1949 North Atlantic
Treaty, which proclaimed the signatories' commitment to the
"preservation of peace and security" in the North Atlantic area. As the
past three decades of NATO transformation have shown, there is not much
that does not fit under the rubric of fostering "peace and security" and
consequently cannot be tacked onto the alliance's agenda. True strategy
[requires setting]{.underline} ([and adhering to]{.underline}) actual
**[goals and priorities]{.underline}**, as well as developing plans to
achieve them. Although the alliance's past strategic documents have
often sought to define NATO's evolving strategic purpose with more
precision than the founding treaty, the alliance has not adopted a new
strategic concept since 2010 for fear that embarking on such an exercise
would only further inflame the deep rifts within the alliance that such
strategic endeavors are meant to help address.

Officially, [NATO members]{.underline} still [assert
collective]{.underline} [defense]{.underline} is the alliance's primary
task, despite the inclusion of two other core tasks --- [projecting
stability and cooperative securit]{.underline}y/crisis management --- in
all three of its post-Cold War Strategic Concepts (1991, 1999, 2010).
The [addition of these latter two core tasks]{.underline} --- coupled
with members' differing threat perceptions about what rises to the level
of an existential security threat --- [has]{.underline} **[clouded the
organization's focus]{.underline}**. [After]{.underline} **[three
decades]{.underline}** [of continual adaptation,]{.underline} the
[danger that]{.underline} the [alliance's original]{.underline} [raison
d'étre of collective defense]{.underline} [gets]{.underline} further
[downgraded to]{.underline} the point where it risks
[becoming]{.underline} [primus inter pares among NATO's many other
responsibilities is real]{.underline}. As with previous critical
junctures in transatlantic relations, it will take American leadership
to change NATO's future course. Come January 2021, a Biden
administration should move swiftly to announce its intention to
commission a new NATO strategic concept by 2022. Should Trump win, all
bets are off.

Defenders of NATO's post-Cold War emphasis on projecting stability and
collective security argue that NATO has a proven track record of crisis
management and capacity-building beyond its borders in places like
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The alliance's
cooperative security track record, however, is hardly stellar. This past
June, the NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo entered
its 22nd year of operation. Almost 17 years after the alliance's
Integrated Military Command first assumed responsibilities in
Afghanistan, the NATO flag continues to fly in Kabul, where some 15,000
allied troops remain as part of NATO's Resolute Support mission. Nor can
the alliance's intervention in Libya in 2011 be considered a resounding
success, judging by the state of affairs there today. That NATO remains
engaged in some of these places decades afterward is not an impeachment
of the men and women who served in these operations and performed the
tasks demanded of them. It is, howevwer, evidence of NATO's failure to
give sufficient consideration to its core strategic purpose.

While one can debate the wisdom of NATO having accumulated such an
expansionist security agenda in an era marked by American unipolarity,
an all-encompassing approach to security is harder to justify in a time
of waning American power. Just as the diminishing threat of great-power
competition in the 1990s and early 2000s freed NATO to take on
additional security tasks beyond its traditional mission of collective
defense, its return should prompt a reexamination to determine whether
NATO is still the appropriate entity for handling such tasks.

[Another center of excellence]{.underline}, special representative, [or
office will not fix what ails NATO]{.underline}. As the authors of a
recent Heritage Foundation report on "NATO in the 21st Century" put it,
it is time for NATO to get "back to the basics." There are limits to
what an international institution --- even one as successful as NATO ---
can accomplish: "When policymakers expect or want NATO to do what it was
never designed to do, that is when the Alliance risks failure."

The launch of NATO Secretary Gen. Jens Stoltenberg's #NATO2030
reflection process earlier this year to address political reforms within
the alliance presented just such an opportunity to tackle these and
other big-picture questions. It is still unclear to what extent the
pandemic has delayed the work of the group of experts begun last March.
The Biden team will have to move quickly if it hopes to help shape the
working group's deliberations, as Stoltenberg is slated to brief members
on the path forward for the alliance at the April 2021 Leaders' Summit.

Back to the Future: Narrowing (Not Broadening) NATO's Remit

[Looking ahead]{.underline}, [alliance leaders should]{.underline}
consider ways to **[streamline current NATO missions]{.underline}** and
tasks [so that responsibilities]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [fall
below the]{.underline} [threshold of]{.underline} [existential
challenges]{.underline} [can be **unloaded onto other multilateral
institutions**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[global
partnerships]{.underline}**. In addition to bringing an end to the
Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, alliance leaders should
consider getting NATO out of the security assistance and stabilization
business altogether. Calls for NATO to look for opportunities to do more
in the MENA region should also be rebuffed. Few would dispute that this
region poses real [security challenges to European states]{.underline}
or that these challenges [are particularly acute]{.underline} for the
southernmost members of the alliance, some of whom might even view
migration and refugee flows as [rising to the level of]{.underline}
**[existential threats]{.underline}**. But while the 21st century
challenges to the "stability and well-being" of member states may be
numerous and growing, there is only one NATO. A single organization
cannot tackle every national security challenge its members face. To
remain useful, the [alliance must]{.underline} **[choose which threats
to prioritize]{.underline}**.

[Doing so requires recognizing that]{.underline} **[not every security
issue]{.underline}** [rises to the level of]{.underline} an [existential
threat to]{.underline} the [alliance]{.underline}. Terrorist attacks
were a common occurrence in many West European nations in the 1970s and
1980s, yet NATO did not fundamentally transform its agenda back then
because members recognized that the threat posed by the Soviet Union was
greater. While neither Russia nor China as yet represents a threat on
par with the Soviet Union, NATO should prepare for the possibility that
the latter (either alone or in combination with
**[Moscow]{.underline}**) **[could pose an existential
challenge]{.underline}** to the Atlantic community in the coming
decades.

Nor is it evident that NATO was ever the appropriate venue for tackling
threats like terrorism in the first place. Effective counter-terrorism
requires intelligence-sharing; local policing and counter-radicalization
programs; and financial instruments that agencies like Europol,
Interpol, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, and others are better
equipped to lead than an overstretched military alliance. The same is
true when it comes to other activities the transatlantic alliance has
added to its roster since 1991, like stabilization missions and security
sector reform. In fact, organizations such as the United Nations, the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the European
Union provide more appropriate venues for tackling many of the
collective security duties the alliance has assumed since the 1990s. As
a regional defensive military alliance, [NATO's comparative advantage
lies in providing territorial defense]{.underline} against other states
or groups of states. This is a comparative advantage that should be
preserved, not diluted by the addition of other security tasks. True
comparative advantage arises from specialization. [Continuing to add
more and more security responsibilities to NATO's
already-full]{.underline} [plate]{.underline} [risks
**transforming**]{.underline} the **[military alliance
into]{.underline}** a **[glorified clearinghouse]{.underline}** [or
administrative apparatus]{.underline} [whose]{.underline} [sole task is
the]{.underline} **[facilitation of information-sharing]{.underline}**
[rather than]{.underline} the provision of **[collective
defense.]{.underline}**

Yes, NATO is better equipped to handle the myriad security problems its
members face than any other multilateral security organization in
existence today. But the proposition that because NATO has the resources
and coordinating mechanisms it should automatically take on the latest
mission du jour is what has led to a strategically deadlocked alliance.

Much like the 1990s, the coming decade will be one of transition for
NATO. Back then, proponents of alliance reform argued that the only way
forward was to enlarge the alliance and take on new responsibilities.
Without such reforms, they claimed, NATO would disappear. The choice
facing NATO members today is different: not a world without NATO, but a
world in which NATO fails to fulfill its intended purpose. Preparing
NATO for China's rise does not mean sending alliance-flagged vessels to
the South China Sea. But the reality is, as Stoltenberg put it last
December, China is already "coming closer to us."

Ultimately, NATO possesses few capabilities of its own. Individual
allies --- and not the alliance itself --- retain ownership and control
over the military material and personnel assigned to NATO operations and
missions. The [alliance's **real strength**]{.underline}, however**[,
lies in its integrated military command structure]{.underline}**.
Preserving and protecting the integrated command structure's
organizational bandwidth should be the primary focus in the coming
years. [Unloading]{.underline} the [alliance's collective security
responsibilities]{.underline} [onto other international
actors]{.underline} would [allow]{.underline} alliance [military
officials to focus on]{.underline} the challenges emanating from China
(and, to a far lesser degree, **[Russia]{.underline}**) [free of the
need to also tackle]{.underline} a host of [lower-threshold security
concerns]{.underline}, all of which require office space, funding, and
personnel billets. Bifurcating collective security tasks from collective
defense would also force European leaders once and for all to decide
exactly what price they are willing to pay for their own national
defense.

The Way Forward

[Instead of seeking to **tackle every** new security
**challenge**]{.underline} of the 21st century, [NATO]{.underline}
leaders [should work to preserve]{.underline} NATO's **[core assets and
capabilities]{.underline}** for the task that it is uniquely suited for:
**[deterring state-based adversaries]{.underline}** and defending the
territorial integrity of its members. The [time when NATO
could]{.underline} be **[both]{.underline}** a **[collective
defense]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} a **[collective
security]{.underline}** organization [has passed]{.underline}. Amid the
reemergence of great-power rivalries, [it no longer makes sense to
assign NATO's limited resources to naval operations in support
of]{.underline} the [refugee crisis]{.underline} as the organization did
back in 2016. Or for the alliance to continue to try its hand at
stabilizing war-torn nations.

NATO has survived this long by adapting. But unlike in the past, where
NATO adaptation has always meant taking on more responsibilities, the
[reforms needed today are]{.underline} those that involve **[shedding
commitments]{.underline}** [rather than taking on
additional]{.underline} [ones]{.underline}. In seeking to [reestablish
NATO]{.underline} once again [as]{.underline} an [alliance focused
**solely on collective defense**]{.underline}, and [not]{.underline} a
[collective security]{.underline} organization, the Biden team will need
to resist the urge to pick up the phone and call NATO Headquarters
whenever a new security challenge emerges, like previous U.S. presidents
have done since the end of the Cold War.

Jettisoning the collective security responsibilities the NATO alliance
has assumed over the past three decades won't be easy. Nor does freeing
NATO from responsibility for tackling issues like counter-terrorism and
instability in the near abroad mean that such threats are not deserving
of international cooperative efforts by states. It simply means that
going forward, countries committed to these kinds of activities will
have to look to organizations and venues other than NATO to address
them.

[Rather than]{.underline} **[expend precious resources]{.underline}**
[and continue to use NATO]{.underline} [as an instrument to grapple with
all]{.underline} manner of [cooperative security]{.underline} issues, a
[Biden administration should]{.underline} instead
**[reorient]{.underline}** the **[alliance's strategic
focus]{.underline}** toward the more pressing task of adjusting to
China's rise. [Not doing so risks turning NATO into]{.underline} nothing
more than a **[glorified discussion club]{.underline}**. To avoid this
fate, the Biden team will have to move quickly. [At stake is not just
alliance unity but]{.underline} NATO's [future utility.]{.underline}

**That's key to deter a [looming Russian invasion]{.underline} of the
[Baltics]{.underline}.**

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} [has]{.underline}
[triggered]{.underline} a [careful balancing act on]{.underline} the
part of [NATO]{.underline} allies, who are eager to see Russia fail but
also unwilling to jump into the war directly. This reflects the same
challenge that has confronted the West vis-à-vis Ukraine for two
decades: how to foster a sovereign Ukraine independent of Russia without
necessarily inviting Kyiv into NATO or the EU.

The bottom line is that militarily, NATO will only offer limited
assistance to Ukraine. [Under Article 5]{.underline} of the North
Atlantic Treaty, [allies are obligated]{.underline} [to treat an attack
on one as an attack on all.]{.underline} But the flip side is that they
are under no obligation to help countries that aren't members of the
club.

While [NATO's]{.underline} short-term role in Ukraine may be limited,
its [bigger role now is to **keep Russia out of the rest of
Europe**]{.underline}. For years, many have taken for granted [that
Putin will stop at NATO's borders]{.underline}, deterred by the promise
of an Article 5 response. But this [is no longer a given in light
of]{.underline} the [Russian leader's **belligerence**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[unpredictability]{.underline}**.

Although NATO's Article 5 has not been triggered, Article 4 has --- the
provision of the treaty allowing member states to request consultations
if they believe their "territorial integrity, political independence or
security" is threatened. Requesting consultations may sound weak-kneed,
but this in fact carries enormous political and diplomatic weight, with
the potential to trigger serious military moves. Last week, no fewer
than eight allies --- Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia --- called for Article 4
consultations because they believe Putin's actions threaten them, too.

The [serious concerns]{.underline} of these eight allies
[are]{.underline} yet another [indication that NATO may have **spread
itself too thin**]{.underline}. Since the end of the Cold War, [NATO has
become]{.underline} something of an '[**all of the above'**
alliance]{.underline}, simultaneously [engaged in collective
defense]{.underline} in Europe, crisis management in places like
Afghanistan and Iraq, [and]{.underline} building [cooperative
security]{.underline} relationships across the globe from Morocco to
Japan. [Now]{.underline}, **[NATO needs to recommit to its original
mission]{.underline}**. In the short term, [it should
**expand**]{.underline} its [**frontline battlegroups** **in** the
**Baltic States** and Poland]{.underline}. In the longer term, the
alliance needs to prepare to admit new members, equip itself to fight
Russian hybrid aggression and expand its permanent presence in Eastern
Europe.

Although the early days of the invasion seemed marked by some major
setbacks for Russia and surprising momentum for Ukraine, the weight of
evidence still points toward a brutal Russian victory. Russia retains
overwhelming military advantage, and its drive to encircle Kyiv
continues unabated. The Russian military has yet to commit all of the
available forces that sit just across Ukraine's borders. And the most
likely outcomes remain a Ukrainian state dominated and/or dismembered by
Russia and neighboring Belarus, which hosts an enduring, offensive
Russian presence close to NATO territory.

NATO's primary response --- made after Article 4 was invoked --- has
been activating the NATO Response Force and its leading element, the
Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, parts of which can deploy in as
little as 48 hours. Notably, the alliance has never deployed any part of
the NRF for collective defense purposes, not even in 2014 when Russia
first invaded Ukraine. Sending this force to the alliance's most exposed
members in Eastern Europe, even though NATO has no intention of taking
part in the war, is a powerful, tangible indicator of NATO's commitment
to defend every inch of allied territory and to deter Russia from
expanding the conflict. [Deploying]{.underline} the [NRF]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} more than symbolic; it's a [response to genuine fears
that]{.underline} the [West may have its work]{.underline} [cut out when
it comes to deterring Putin.]{.underline}

Beyond this collective response, several [NATO countries individually
have committed to sending more defensive forces to Eastern European
members]{.underline} and to continuing or increasing the flow of
military assistance to Ukraine. These measures include the deployment of
thousands of additional U.S. troops to Europe for both defensive
purposes and to assist in managing the influx of Ukrainian refugees, an
additional \$350 million in U.S. security assistance for Ukraine,
Germany's groundbreaking decision to send anti-tank weapons and
man-portable surface-to-air missiles, and an array of other steps.

The [**question is whether all of this is enough to prevent** **Putin
from looking**]{.underline} beyond Ukraine **[to]{.underline}** the
**[Baltic States]{.underline}** or elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
[He]{.underline} [may intend to create]{.underline} more [buffer
space]{.underline} [along Russia's western border]{.underline},
[regain]{.underline} some [lost semblance of Russian
greatness]{.underline}, bolster his [declining approval
ratings]{.underline} [at home or solidify his legacy]{.underline}. The
point is, **[Putin's evident unpredictability]{.underline}** --- [and
his government's blatant lies]{.underline} on the eve of the invasion
--- [create doubt that **Western defense**]{.underline} and deterrence
**[thus far are adequate.]{.underline}**

[To reduce the risk that]{.underline} [Putin will expand the
conflict]{.underline} [beyond]{.underline} [Ukraine]{.underline} and
prepare for the new reality of post-conflict Europe, **[NATO should
expand]{.underline}** **[the scale, mission and
capabilities]{.underline}** [of the units]{.underline} [that would be on
the front lines of]{.underline} any [Russian attack]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} [Eastern European NATO countries]{.underline}. The
Enhanced Forward Presence battlegroups, located in Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Poland, were established in 2017 as a somewhat belated
response to Russia's first invasion of Ukraine. Since 20 out of NATO's
30 members contribute troops to these battlegroups, they represent a
"tripwire": If Russia was to invade one of the four host nations,
several alliance members would likely sustain casualties, which would
spur a faster, more unified NATO response. In this way, the [EFP
**battlegroups** help deter Russia by signaling NATO's **increased
willingness to take a risk**]{.underline} --- the basic game theory at
the heart of deterrence.

But shortcomings persist. Each battlegroup consists of roughly 1,200
troops, which probably isn't enough to deny Russian advances. The EFP
units also lack persistent American contributions (except for the unit
in Poland, which is U.S.-led), struggle to share information internally
and with one another, and lack the ability to tackle hybrid Russian
threats.

It's reasonably clear that Russia understands it will incur costs if it
invades a NATO country --- what international relations scholars call
"deterrence by punishment." What's less clear is whether Russia sees the
NATO military presence as foreboding enough to rule out the idea of
invasion altogether --- or "deterrence by denial."

To change Putin's calculation about a potential invasion of the Baltics
or Poland, [NATO]{.underline} can take a number of steps. First, it
[should expand]{.underline} each EFP unit to an enhanced brigade of
5,000 [troops]{.underline}. [This would dramatically
increase]{.underline} the [deterrent effect given]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} a typical [Western brigade is a far]{.underline}
[more]{.underline} [capable]{.underline}, self-sufficient [combat
formation]{.underline} in a way that a battlegroup simply is not.

Second, the United States should contribute at least a battalion to each
of the expanded EFP units. There's no substitute for American boots on
the ground in Europe, [which are a **physical manifestation
of**]{.underline} the United States' commitment to **[Article
5.]{.underline}**

Third, the alliance should quickly provide each EFP unit (and the four
nations that host them) common advanced, secure voice and data
communications equipment and network tools, perhaps supplied by the
United States. It's here --- in communications --- where the number of
allies involved in EFP is an Achilles heel instead of a strength. Twenty
contributing allies can mean 20 different types of radios and computers,
leading to serious internal communication challenges --- a problem not
faced by the Russians, who operate largely without allies. A common,
off-the-shelf solution will not only enable the individual contributors
to each EFP battlegroup to communicate, but also permit more effective
communication between EFP units so they can operate together across
borders.

Fourth, NATO should expand the mission of the EFP units. Currently, the
units are almost entirely focused on conventional military missions.
They are not equipped to conduct operations in the information space,
with electronic warfare and signals jamming, or in cyberspace. Yet when
I visited the units last year, I learned that they struggle against
Russian information, electronic and cyber attacks almost every day. The
alliance ought to authorize the EFP units to engage in these domains
(only in accordance with host-nation policies, of course).

Beyond immediately strengthening EFP, [NATO needs to **think more
strategically**]{.underline} [about how to adjust]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the [aftermath of Russia's dramatic]{.underline}
[upending of European security]{.underline}. **[Given]{.underline}** the
challenges posed by Russia (and to a lesser degree, China) and the
**[requirements of collective defense,]{.underline}** [**NATO probably
can't do it all**. It will]{.underline} either [need to pare down
its]{.underline} appetite and **[focus almost entirely on collective
defense]{.underline}** [as in the Cold War]{.underline}, or receive
increased resources from the allies to maintain the global set of tasks
it's taken on since the 1990s, including in crisis management and
security cooperation in Africa, Asia and elsewhere.

**Baltics invasion causes [nuclear war]{.underline}. [Only]{.underline}
strengthening traditional defense [caps escalation]{.underline}.**

Yet a [series of reports by]{.underline} the [nonpartisan RAND
Corporation]{.underline} [shows]{.underline} that the **[possibility of
nuclear escalation]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} a conflict
[between]{.underline} the [N]{.underline}orth [A]{.underline}tlantic
[T]{.underline}reaty [O]{.underline}rganization [and Russia
over]{.underline} the [Baltic region is higher than one might
imagine.]{.underline} The [best way of averting it? **Invest more in the
alliance's conventional defense.**]{.underline}

There was a time when it seemed quite normal to risk nuclear war over
the sanctity of European frontiers. During the Cold War, NATO was
outnumbered by Warsaw Pact forces, and it would have had great
difficulty stopping a Soviet attack with conventional weapons. From the
moment it was formed, NATO relied on the threat of nuclear escalation
--- whether rapid and spasmodic, or gradual and controlled --- to
maintain deterrence. American thinkers developed elaborate models and
theories of deterrence. US and NATO forces regularly carried out
exercises simulating the resort to nuclear weapons to make this strategy
credible.

After the Cold War ended, the US and its allies had the luxury of
thinking less about nuclear deterrence and war-fighting. Tensions with
Russia receded and nuclear strategy came to seem like a relic of a
bygone era. Yet [today]{.underline}, [with Russia rising again as a
military threat]{.underline}, **[the grim logic of nuclear statecraft is
returning.]{.underline}**

The [spike in tensions between Russia and]{.underline} the
[West]{.underline} over the past half-decade has [revealed]{.underline}
a basic problem: [NATO]{.underline} [doesn't have]{.underline} the
[capability to]{.underline} [prevent Russian forces from]{.underline}
quickly [overrunning Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania]{.underline}. Russian
invaders would be at the gates of the Baltic capitals in two to three
days; existing [NATO forces]{.underline} in the region [would be
destroyed]{.underline} or swept aside. [NATO could respond by
**mobilizing**]{.underline} for a **[longer war]{.underline}** [to
liberate]{.underline} the [Baltic countries]{.underline}, but this would
require a bloody, dangerous military campaign. Critically, that
[campaign would require striking targets]{.underline} --- such as air
defense systems --- [located within Russia itself]{.underline}, as well
as suppressing Russian artillery, short-range missiles and other
capabilities within the Kaliningrad enclave, which is situated behind
NATO's front lines.

Moreover, this sort of NATO counteroffensive is precisely the situation
Russian nuclear doctrine seems meant to avert. Russian officials
understand that their country would lose a long war against NATO. They
are particularly alarmed at the possibility of NATO using its unmatched
military capabilities to conduct conventional strikes within Russian
borders. So the [Kremlin has signaled that it might carry out **limited
nuclear strikes**]{.underline} --- perhaps a "demonstration strike"
somewhere in the Atlantic, or [against NATO forces in the
theater]{.underline} --- to force the alliance to make peace on Moscow's
terms. This concept is known as "escalate to de-escalate," and there is
a growing body of evidence that the Russians are serious about it.

[A NATO**-Russia war could thus go nuclear** if]{.underline} [Russia
"escalates" to preserve]{.underline} the [gains it has won early in the
conflict]{.underline}. It could also go nuclear in a second, if somewhat
less likely, way: [If]{.underline} the [U.S. and **NATO initiate their
own limited nuclear strikes**]{.underline} [against Russian
forces]{.underline} [to prevent Moscow]{.underline} [from
overrunning]{.underline} the [Baltic]{.underline} allies in the first
place. And [even the limited use of nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s
raises]{.underline} the [question of further escalation]{.underline}:
Would [crossing the nuclear threshold lead, through]{.underline}
deliberate choice or **[miscalculation]{.underline}**,
**[to]{.underline}** a [**general nuclear war** involving]{.underline}
[i]{.underline}nter[c]{.underline}ontinental [b]{.underline}allistic
[m]{.underline}issile[s]{.underline}, [strategic bombers
and]{.underline} **[apocalyptic destruction]{.underline}**?

So what to do? One option would be for the West to pull back --- to
conclude that any game that involves risking nuclear war over the Baltic
states is not worth the candle. The logic here is superficially
compelling. After all, the US could survive and thrive in a world where
Russia dominated Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, just as it survived and
thrived during the Cold War, when those countries were part of the
Soviet Union. The problem is that **[failing to defend]{.underline}**
the **[Baltic states]{.underline}** would [devalue]{.underline} the
[Article 5 guarantee on which NATO rests]{.underline}: the principle
that an attack on one is an attack on all. And given that one could
raise similar questions about so many US commitments --- would declining
to meet a Chinese attack on the Philippines really endanger America's
existence? --- this failure [could]{.underline}
**[undermine]{.underline}** the **[broader alliance
system]{.underline}** [that has delivered peace and stability for so
many decades.]{.underline}

Imagine two universes. In the first one, information systems are
impervious to manipulation from the outside. No unauthorized person one
can change the instructions that systems run and systems react to all
input as they are supposed to (that is, consistent with the common
understanding of designers and users). This is a world in which the
**[potential effects of cyberwar are]{.underline}**, at most,
**[weak]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [largely
irrelevant]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the conduct of
[violent]{.underline} (i.e., kinetic) [conflict]{.underline}. In the
second universe, cyberwar is potentially consequence; it where we live
today.

In which universe is violent conflict -- war, if you will -- more
likely? In recent years, two scholars who agree on little else, Tomas
Rid and John Arquilla, have put forward the case that the second
universe, [today's is less likely to be warlike]{.underline}
[than]{.underline} the first universe, [where cyberwar is]{.underline}
[impossible]{.underline} or at least inconsequential.\[1\]
**[Cyberwar]{.underline}**, in effect, **[is good for
peace]{.underline}**. Both [scholars pivot their argument over
Stuxnet]{.underline}, a piece of malware that was responsible for the
destruction of roughly a thousand centrifuges in Iran's
uranium-enrichment facility, Natanz. [Had the means]{.underline} [of
cyberwar not been available]{.underline}, they argue, [there
is]{.underline} a serious [likelihood that]{.underline} Israel or even
the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would have tried to
destroy]{.underline} Natanz [using]{.underline} [air raids.]{.underline}
Such **[air raids would likely have produced casualties]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, the [use of violence]{.underline} [might have
begotten]{.underline} violence in return -- more likely terrorism (given
Iran's modus operandi) than **[open war]{.underline}**, but the latter
could not have been ruled out. Thus, [the existence of
Stuxnet]{.underline} [allowed]{.underline} the [problem]{.underline}
created by Iran's desire to enrich uranium (in order to making nuclear
weapons) [to be dealt with in a nonviolent way]{.underline}. To the
extent that Stuxnet is archetypical, **[cyberwar is good for
peace.]{.underline}**

This paper argues that the case that cyberwar is good for peace is by no
means so clear, something that can be demonstrated by a more rounded
analysis of what cyberwar does and what the alternatives to cyberwar
really are. To start, consider another attack on the (supposed) nuclear
facility being constructed in Syria with North Korean help. \[2\] In
2007, Israeli jets destroyed this facility (Operation Orchard).
According to Richard Clarke (and others), the air strike was aided by a
cyberattack on Syria's air defense system which essentially erased radar
images of incoming aircraft allowing all the aircraft to make it back
safely.\[3\] Now suppose that a cyberattack really was employed (other
accounts say that more conventional electronic warfare was used\[4\]).
Further suppose that, without the confidence that cyberwar would have
disabled the radar, the raid's planners would have been deemed it too
costly in terms of lost aircraft and pilots and hence called it off. In
the first universe, where the tools of cyberwar were unavailable, no
raid would have taken place, no destruction would have ensued, and no
casualties (Operation Orchard left one to two dozen dead) would have
resulted. In that calculus, the cyberwar capabilities lead to more
rather than less violence. Had Syria retaliated, a further cycle of
violence might have commenced.

This example suggests that the picture is a little more complicated than
the notion that [cyberwar allows **nonviolent means to replace violent**
**means**.]{.underline} A full analysis must ask (1) what choices are
available with and without cyberwar, (2) what responses are likely to a
cyberwar attack, and (3) what does the threat of cyberwar say for the
likelihood of conflict, qua stability. Such analyses also have to be
sensitive to different contexts. What may hold for a conflict among
comparably strong countries may not hold for a conflict among countries,
one of which is clearly stronger than the other. Furthermore, the
possibility of operational cyberwar (used against an opponent's military
forces) may lead to different answers than the possibility of strategic
cyberwar (used against an opponent's infrastructure and society, usually
away from the battlefield).

But first: why does this question matter? Normally, comparing the world
as it is to a counterfactual world in which something had not taken
place is a completely academic exercise. Un-invention never takes place
(even if people do walk away from some technologies -- nuclear power
comes to mind). Weapons control is oft pursued and only occasionally
succeeds (chemical and biological weapons provide the best example, but
such weapons have low military utility, anyway). [Although people worry
about cyberattacks]{.underline}, the fact that [they]{.underline} are
not heinous -- and, indeed, **[have yet to hurt anyone
directly]{.underline}** -- [coupled with]{.underline} the technical
difficulties of enforcing arms control on virtual instruments of war
suggests that they are unlikely to be banned. Norms against certain uses
of cyberwar may have better chances, but they may also be worth less in
terms of assurance.

Cyberweapons have been hyped as an attractive alternative to
conventional weapons due

to their affordability. Amy Chang a research associate in the technology
and national security

program at the Center for a New American Security states, "cyber warfare
is a great alternative

to conventional weapons, it is cheaper for and far more accessible to
these small nation-

3

states."3Ross Rustici argues that "Cyberweapons are a cheap way to build
a global strike

capability against networked states."4 He argues that poor states, who
were incapable of

challenging larger more technologically advanced states with
conventional weapons can now

take can now them on in cyber.

They are both partially correct. A cyberwarfare capability can be
purchased on the

internet for a couple hundred dollars; one can purchase malware and
botnets or hire the services

of a self-trained hacker.5

Gabriel Weimann identifies that "all terrorists need is an online

connection and personal computer."6 What could be purchased at this
price can be crude but very

effective. The ILOVEYOU virus was able to shut down businesses for hours
and caused around

6 billion dollars in damages.7 Why would one waste money on expensive
conventional weapon

that need upgrades and become obsolete when they can drop \$200 on
Craigslist for a virus or the

services of a 'weekend cyberwarrior'?

Not all cyberweapons are created equally. As effective (causing damage
to unprotected

computers) as it was, ILOVEYOU was not a militarized cyberweapon; it
could not be directed

against a specific target, could not be controlled and was not
sophisticated enough to penetrate

sensitive military networks. It proved to be more of an annoyance by
indiscriminately attacking

hundreds of countries and millions of random emails.8

Thomas Rid points out that exceptional

cyber weapons require a lot of technical expertise and funding, hence
they would not be the

preferred weapons of poor countries or non-state actors.9

A true cyberwarfare capability is

expensive. The technologically advanced Stuxnet was able to discern
targets and could be

controlled by the user after launch. It is estimated that Stuxnet cost
around US\$3 million dollars

to create.10 Additionally it is believed that the virus was tested by
experts for many months

before it was actually launched.11 As malware and viruses become more
and more complex so do

the defenses that prevent them from infecting computers. Advanced
defenses will only raise the

costs and the entry requirements into militarized cyberspace.

Accessibility

Launching a real cyberattack is harder to achieve than media and movies
portray it. An

obvious disadvantage to the state that wishes to replace physical
weapons with cyber weapons is

that all future opponents 1) need to be present in cyberspace and 2)
they need to be vulnerable to

cyberattack.

The first element is self-evident. You can't attack someone in
cyberspace if they don't

have a presence in cyberspace. There are many countries, mostly poor and
not technically

advanced, whose government, military and citizens are minimally
connected. An attempted

cyberattack against such an unconnected country would have little to no
effect and might even

go unnoticed. An advantage of physical weapons is that they can be
employed against anyone

within range. Declaring cyberwar on a group that is not networked or
dependent on IT systems

will not be all that productive.

Cyberattack, the critical component of cyberwarfare is reliant on,
vulnerability. "One

distinction between cyberwarfare and warfare in all other media must be
made: cyber warfare

requires that the targets have made mistakes in their implementation and
use of digital

Sites,\" Bloomberg (2010).

equipment"12 If the adversary has a tight cybersecurity perimeter that
is not penetrable, then

there is no cyberattack that can occur. A country that is in cyberspace
can at any time reduce or

remove their presence. Making cyberattack difficult is not impossible.
One way to protect

oneself against cyberattack is electronic isolation. By "air-gapping" a
network from the rest of

the world a state makes it very difficult for outsiders to penetrate a
system.13 The majority of

classified US Defense and other Western defense networks are air-gapped
making if very

difficult to conduct a cyberattack.14 "Air-gapping" can reduce one's
vulnerability, however

human error plays a role in even the most perceptively secure systems,
as was the case with

Buckshot Yankee. Buckshot Yankee, "the most significant breach of U.S.
military computers

was caused by a flash drive inserted into a U.S. military laptop on a
post in the Middle East in

2008."15 The virus compromised a large amount of defense related
sensitive material. Whether a

network is connected to the internet or not, cyberwarfare in all cases
requires a window of

opportunity that is not necessarily going to be open when and where you
need it to be.

Even when the opportunity exits to penetrate a system, an advanced
country reliant on

cyberspace is going to employ advanced cyber defenses. Vulnerabilities
will be hard to exploit.

It is not difficult to immunize one's networks from cyberattack.
Advanced cyberdefenses are

layered with other security measures to include "computing instructions
that can only be

manipulated by hands on access to the hardware, preventing malware or
malicious software with

rogue instructions being placed on the machines."16 This makes
cyberattack against an advanced

state target very challenging.

Vulnerability is requisite but so is preparation time. It is true a
cyberattack could be

launched at the click of a keyboard and the cyber projectile can arrive
at target destination

instantaneously. There is however a substantial amount of preparation
that needs to occur prior

to an attack whether retaliatory or pre-emptively. The Stuxnet attack
would have needed

extensive knowledge of the nuclear facilities in Iran but also people
with nuclear reactor

expertise.17

The need for so many pre-conditions to exist makes cyber not a
particularly responsive

means to retaliate. When attacked by a physical weapon it is relatively
easy to respond with

another physical weapon. If you are in range, your adversary is probably
in range. For a

cyberattack to be effective as a pre-emptive strike option, the target
needs to be known well in

advance, time is needed to probe the opponent's system for
vulnerabilities before attack. This is

one of the reasons cyberattack was not used during the NATO attack on
Libya in 2011. The

attack was not foreseen in time to employ cyber means.18 One is not
necessarily vulnerable to

your cyberweapon by virtue of their cyberspace presence.

Network vulnerabilities when found, are fleeting, especially with
technologically

advanced states. When they are exploited and attacked they will be
sensed by the defender and

repaired quickly. "Even if a potent cyber-weapon could be launched
successfully once, it would

be highly questionable if an attack, or even a salvo, could be repeated
in order to achieve a

political goal."19

There are many things that can be done to reduce cyber and network
weakness. If an

attack was impending there are substantially even more measures that can
be taken. Just because

one has a cyberweapon does not mean one can use it at a time and place
of choosing. It needs to

be enabled by the opponent's carelessness and ignorance. For this reason
alone cyberweapons

will never be a replacement for conventional weapons.

Risk and Cyberwarfare

Patrick Lin in his Atlantic article sees cyberwarfare as a low risk
alternative to

conventional warfare.

This also means new channels for warfare. Indeed, a target in cyberspace
is more

appealing than conventional physical targets, since the aggressor would
not need

to incur the expense and risk of transporting equipment and deploying
troops

across borders into enemy territory, not to mention the political risk
of casualties.

Cyberweapons could be used to attack anonymously at a distance while
still

causing much mayhem.20

Cyberwarfare is not a riskless affair to the user. A characteristic of
cyberspace is that it is very

difficult to determine the follow-on effect of actions taken in
cyberspace and even more difficult

to try to control these effects. Physical weapons are tangible; they can
be inventoried, expended

and destroyed if required. When cyberweapons are used in cyberspace the
user may not always

be able to contain the weapon's effects or control its use and eventual
destination. This can have

three very negative consequences:

19 Thomas Rid and Peter McBurney, \"Cyber-Weapons,\" Rusi Journal 157,
no. 1 (2012).

20 Patrick Lin, \"Is it Possible to Wage just a Cyberwar?\" The Atlantic
(2012).

Firstly, a state's cyberweapon will not necessarily discern enemy from
friendly in

cyberspace. A launched cyberweapon could seep into the attacker's
networks and infect the

systems of the employer resulting in negative consequences. Conventional
weapons effects are

observable and finite. It is not easy to tell what kind of damage a
cyberweapon has done or

where a virus ultimately ends up. When a state loses control of the
effects of its weapons, the

attacking state could do more damage to itself that to the intended
target. Consequences of cyber

blowback would not be contained to defense systems and would include the
technologies that are

integral to the state's citizens. Major efficiencies and economic
production could be

compromised. The secondary effects caused by engaging in cyberwarfare
could undermine a

state's citizen's trust in cyberspace well into the future.

Secondly, a country that uses and creates advanced cyberweapons will
need to be very

reliant on IT systems. This serves to increase a state's vulnerability
to the very cyberweapons it

is producing. It also increases the attractiveness of that state to
other states wishing to employ

cyberattack.21

Thirdly, the most lucrative targets and typically most vulnerable in
cyberspace are nonmilitary. Attempting to defeat the adversary by
attacking the economy and industry of a country

through cyber will have global consequences given the interconnectedness
of the world. Power

generators and communications networks are intertwined with other cities
and countries. IT

infrastructure and private networks are connected globally.22 Due to the
interconnectedness of

the financial systems, a successful attack against for example Wall
Street will more than likely

have negative consequences to an attacker's allies and the country
itself. Interdependencies are

not always obvious in cyberspace.23

PART II

Cyberdeterrence

Threat and deterrence are unique psychological aspects within the
concept of war. The

aim of deterrence is to persuade an adversary not to initiate action for
fear the retaliation would

not be outweigh potential benefits.

A state deploys a deterrent strategy to protect an interest. To keep
adversaries

from attacking the interest, a state makes a deterrent declaration, 'Do
not do this,

or else that will happen.' This is any adversary action that would
threaten the

\[state's\] interest. That includes either denial measures, penalty
measures, or

both.24

There is a significant body of knowledge that shows wars have been
averted due to the

perception of strength or perception of powerful weapons that were in
reality not as powerful as

they appeared.25 If arguing for cyberwar as a legitimate form of war, it
would be rational to

assume that the associated negative costs and risks of engaging in
cyberwar could act as a

deterrent. Will Goodman who has served as an advisor to US Defense dept.
argues cyberwarfare

can be used as an effective deterrent. He states that "Cyberdeterrence
proves easier in practice

than it seems to be in theory because cyberattacks are ultimately
inseparable from the physical

domain, where deterrence has a long-demonstrated record of success".

26

Cyberwarfare however does not represent an effective means to apply the
functions of

deterrence. Deterrence requires two key elements: a credible threat and
ability to communicate

Privacy 3, no. 6 (2005).

the threat. Cyber unfortunately does neither effectively. Cyber coercion
cannot compel like

physical means can. A physical force in a tangible environment is still
preferred.

Known cyberwarfare capability on its own is not compelling. "All
publicly known

cyberweapons have far less 'firepower' than is commonly assumed".27 To
deter, you need to

make the adversary believe that an attack will cause some level of pain
and suffering. Though

the Stuxnet example might be an example of how physical damage can be
delivered via cyber

(albeit indirectly), for now it is the exception rather than the rule in
cyberwarfare. The cyber

attacker in reality is very limited in what can be achieved.
Interrupting a state's industry or

military communications network are irritating notions and could weaken
the state temporarily,

they are however temporary and any resulting destruction could be fixed
fairly quickly as

previous examples have indicated. Retired US Marine General James
Cartwright has been urging

the US military to be more overt with their cyber capability.

We\'ve got to step up the game; we\'ve got to talk about our offensive
capabilities

and train to them; to make them credible so that people know there\'s a
penalty to

this,\" said Cartwright. \"You can\'t have something that\'s a secret be
a deterrent.

Because if you don\'t know it\'s there, it doesn\'t scare you.28

Cartwright is correct, if you want to deter, having the capability is
important but you also need to

communicate to your enemy your ability. What Cartwright fails to
realize, is how hard this is to

do in cyberspace. When it comes to deterrence, actions speak louder than
words. In

cyberwarfare deterrence is difficult.

Pointing to one's ability to use cyberweapons effectively in the past
would not

necessarily be all that compelling. If a computer virus was launched in
the past and discovered, it

can be safe to say an attack employing an identical or similar virus and
using similar

27 Rid and McBurney, Cyber-Weapons

28 Shane McGlaun, \"DARPA Wants More Money for Cyber Weapons,\" Daily
Tech Magazine, 2011, .

11

vulnerabilities would be nearly impossible to deliver again.
Additionally the cyberweapon design

utilized will have been dissected and access points patched. As soon as
Stuxnet was discovered it

was globally "outted" and neutralized.

Once you know that it\'s there it\'s not that difficult to reverse
engineer.

Neutralization of Stuxnet, once its operation is understood, would not
be that

difficult as it was precisely engineered to disrupt a specific item of
machinery,

once Stuxnet' s signature is identified it can be eliminated from a
system .29

Launching a lesser show of force attack like overtly probing an enemy's
servers or causing

minor network disruptions to illustrate a capability would work well in
an observable world, but

not so much in the virtual world. By conducting a show of force you
telegraph your intent to use

cyberwarfare. Lupovici sees this as a significant drawback stating,
"exposing the offensive

capabilities as the consequence of repeated attacks may serve as the
basis of knowledge or

inspiration for the challenger, it is also likely to allow enemies to
prepare for a future threat."30

Attribution is another challenge in cyberdeterrence. The advantage of
easily being

anonymous in cyberspace has its benefits and drawbacks. When trying to
coerce in cyberspace it

is a drawback. Cyberspace is not an exclusive club where all members are
known, like the

'nuclear club' of the Cold War. The majority of the world is operating
in cyberspace.31 This

poses a problem in deterrence as the sender of a cyberdeterrence message
may not be known.

When the sender is not known the message can be misinterpreted, misread,
misidentified or

perhaps not even detected. There is a difference between a cyberattack
that originates from a

domestic hacker and one that is external and state sanctioned. The
attack against Estonia in 2007

used hundreds of thousands of computers from 178 countries against 90%
of the key information

News- Middle East, 2012, .

systems in the country.32 The origin of the attack could not be
determined; without knowing who

was attacking it is difficult to determine what the purpose of the
attack even is. Estonia is an

example of how difficult it might be to attribute what the message is
and where it is coming

from.

Cyberspace is not a good venue to achieve deterrence. Physical weapons
and their effects

are observable and their effects are understood making deterrence
compelling. Deterrence

through cyber is not effective as one cannot effectively communicate the
threat in which one

should fear.

Cyberpower

Could cyberpower replace conventional military means in other domains?
Cyberpower,

as a new form of warfare has been compared to the emerging airpower
theory of the 20th century.

Andrew Krepinevich states, "in the context of the historical analogies
discussed, the state of

cyber weapon development appears to most closely approximate that of
airpower during the

1930s."33 He further states that a "cyberattack on an advanced state's
critical infrastructure

achieves results more similar to those of the strategic bombing
campaigns of World War II"34It is

argued that cyberweapons can strike at strategic targets like industry
supporting the war effort

and the state infrastructure so crucial in holding the will of the
people together. Conceptually,

there are obvious similarities between airpower and cyberpower, however
the domains of

cyberspace and air are vastly different. The most glaring difference is
in the potential to create

destruction. During WWII, Allied aerial bombing campaigns could
effectively strike deep into

Nazi Germany, degrading support to the war effort.

The German experience suggest that even a first class military power-
rugged and

resilient as Germany was- cannot live long under full-scale and free
exploitation

of air weapons over the heart of its territory. By the beginning of
1945, before the

invasion of the homeland itself, Germany was reaching a state of
helplessness.

Her armament production was failing irretrievably, orderliness in effort
was

disappearing, and total disruption and disintegration were well along.35

Bombing campaigns targeted civilian targets like transportation,
electricity and manufacturing

infrastructure that enabled war production. Assessment reports post
Second World War

determined irreparable physical damage needed to occur to inflict
strategic victory over the

means of production.36

Cyberattacks cannot achieve destruction of infrastructure like

conventional weapons can. Networks can be disrupted temporarily but the
hardware and

machines that enable cyberspace will still be intact. "Because cyberwar
does not involve

bombing cities or devastating armored columns, the damage inflicted will
have a short-term

impact on targets".37

Another effect of aerial bombardment is the immediate delivery of shock
and destruction.

It is seen and felt. Cyberweapons are incapable of delivering this
sensation. Empirical evidence

shows that a cyberweapon has never caused immediate direct damage and
destruction on the

same level as bombs. Stuxnet took many months to damage Iranian nuclear
facilities.38

Aerial bombardment can be overwhelming on first strike, but usually
requires multiple

waves and re-attack to achieve strategic goals. This was noted in the US
Strategic Bombing

Survey, "no indispensable industry was permanently put out of commission
by a single attack.

Persistent re-attack was necessary."39

Attacks were rarely successful on the first attempt and if

they were, the German industry was very capable of replacing and
rebuilding infrastructure.40

Persistent attacks is not a luxury in cyberwarfare.

Cyberattacks "are most effective as an opening salvo in war".

41 Once an attacker has

infiltrated a network the defender will quickly move to patch the
vulnerability and perhaps even

close the network from the outside. For a re-attack to occur, another
vulnerability in the system

would need to be found. The more attacks that are launched against a
system the harder it

becomes to find future vulnerabilities.

Though cyberattacks can achieve disruption of critical industry in depth
for minimal

expenditure, they are not a replacement for airpower as they are
incapable of delivering the

carnage of bombs and cannot be employed persistently. The more pragmatic
use of

cyberweapons is in a combined force environment which may be alongside
strategic bombing

campaigns but always synchronized with conventional warfare assets

[Nato is to increase its forces]{.underline} on high alert [by **more
than sevenfold** to 300,000 in response to Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} as part of a sweeping overhaul [to **better protect
its eastern flank.**]{.underline}

In a historic shift from the post-cold war era, when military spending
was cut and troops pulled back from eastern Europe, secretary-general
Jens [Stoltenberg]{.underline} [said]{.underline} the [western alliance
would also]{.underline} [increase]{.underline} [deployments]{.underline}
[close to Russia]{.underline}, **[shifting]{.underline}** the
**[focus]{.underline}** from deterring any invasion **[to]{.underline}**
a **[full defence of allied territory]{.underline}**.

The [pledge to increase]{.underline} the [number of troops on high
alert]{.underline} across allied countries from 40,000 came as G7
leaders vowed to impose new sanctions to curb Moscow's import of
technology for its arms industry, amid efforts by western countries to
respond to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking before the announcement, Stoltenberg told the Financial Times
that the new [military blueprint would]{.underline} [**drastically
upgrade its eastern** **defences**]{.underline}, [tearing up a
model]{.underline} that could have [meant]{.underline}
[relinquishing]{.underline} [and]{.underline} then [attempting to
recapture the Baltic states]{.underline} in the event of a Russian
invasion.

[Estonia's prime minister]{.underline} has [claimed]{.underline} that
the [current doctrine accepted that]{.underline} the **[Baltic states
would be "wiped off the map]{.underline}**" [in the event of a Russian
assault]{.underline} before Nato attempted a counter-attack to liberate
them after 180 days.

"We never share the details of operational plans," Stoltenberg said.
"But I can assure you that we have been able to protect countries
bordering Russia for decades, adjusting our presence in light of the
threat assessment. We have done that before and we will do it again."

The [alliance would "significantly reinforce" its defences in eastern
Europe]{.underline}, he said, pledging that Russia would not be able to
capture the Estonian capital Tallinn "just as they have not been able to
seize the city of Kirkenes in northern Norway or West Berlin during the
cold war".

The [new "strategic concept]{.underline}", to be signed off at an annual
summit of alliance leaders that begins on Tuesday in Madrid, would
define its goals and approaches for the next decade, and agree on a
vastly expanded plan to defend its easternmost allies in response to
Russian president Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

That will [include new structures in which]{.underline} western [Nato
allies]{.underline}, such as the US, UK and France, would
[pledge]{.underline} their ships, warplanes and a total of more than
[300,000 troops to be ready to deploy to specific
territories]{.underline} on the alliance's eastern flank,
[with]{.underline} [graded response times]{.underline} starting from the
opening hours of any attack.

STUTTGART, Germany --- NATO plans to approve increased readiness
objectives and provide more support to Ukraine, as well as formalize a
key strategic document at its annual summit this week, alliance
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Monday.

At the summit held Tuesday and Wednesday in Madrid member nations will
agree to increase the number of high-readiness forces to "well over"
300,000 troops, in what Stoltenberg called the biggest overhaul of the
alliance's collective defense and deterrence since the Cold War. The
alliance plans to enhance many of its forward-deployed battlegroups
currently stationed in its eastern member countries up to brigade
levels, he noted in a press conference broadcast online from Brussels.

The readiness increase will be matched with more prepositioned equipment
and supplies stockpiles, notably air defense capabilities, he added.
NATO is also planning to upgrade its defense plans, and pre-assign
troops to defend specific allies.

"These troops will exercise together with home defense forces, and they
will become familiar with local terrain facilities and our new
prepositioned stocks, so that they can respond smoothly and swiftly to
any emergency," Stoltenberg said.

The ongoing war in Ukraine will be at the top of the summit's program,
particularly as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to attend.
NATO plans to approve a new comprehensive aid package for Kiev, to
include "partial deliveries" of capabilities like secure communications,
unmanned systems and fuel, per Stoltenberg.

NATO's identification of Russia as its most significant threat will be
reflected in the ongoing deliberations over whether Finland and Sweden
will become the alliance's newest members. While Stoltenberg and other
stakeholders have called for the two partner nations to join NATO as
quickly as possible, member Turkey has promised to veto their accession,
claiming Sweden has harbored members of the Kurdish Worker's Party
(PKK), which Ankara considers a terrorist organization.

On Monday, Stoltenberg reasserted the need to "take into account
concerns expressed by allies" and said that the leaders of Finland,
Sweden, and Turkey would meet at NATO headquarters in Brussels later
that day, as well as on the sidelines of the Madrid summit this week.

"I will not make any promises, but I can just assure you that we are
working actively to ensure progress, because the applications of Finland
and Sweden to join NATO -- they are historic," Stoltenberg said. "It
will strengthen the security of Finland and Sweden, it will strengthen
NATO, and it will be something that will contribute to stability across
the Euro-Atlantic area, Europe and North America."

NATO member nations are also expected to formally approve the new
"Strategic Concept" document which lays out the alliance's defense and
security vision. Members tasked NATO to update the Strategic Concept
document at the 2021 summit. Per the alliance, the document has been
updated about once every 10 years to reflect the current security
environment.

This latest concept will reflect a "fundamental shift in NATO's
deterrence and defense" and will focus on NATO's "evolving approach" to
current and new threats and challenges, to include terrorism, cyber
attacks, and hybrid warfare, Stoltenberg said Monday.

Deterrence and defence

[NATO endorsed its **posture of deterrence and defence**]{.underline}
[after]{.underline} the [ratification of the Lisbon Strategic
Concept]{.underline} as a means of having a combination of capabilities
appropriate to a range of possible scenarios.\[7\] In the absence of a
specific adversary, the capabilities to be established could only be
generic, but [the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} its burgeoning [hostility]{.underline} [forced the
Alliance's military posture to be redefined]{.underline}. [NATO had to
deploy forces on its Eastern border to reassure]{.underline} the
[allies]{.underline} and strengthen its capacity for deterrence.

The Russian aggression forced the natural procedure to be inverted and,
since 2014, NATO has had to adapt its deterrence and defence posture to
the new situation without waiting for the formal review of the Lisbon
Strategic Concept. It began by strengthening its reassurance and
adaptation measures on its eastern flank (its Readiness Action Plan) in
2014,\[8\] followed by a review of its military strategy (MC 400/4) in
2019, the adaptation of its defence and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic
region (Defence and Deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic Area, DDA) in 2020
and NATO's fundamental concept of combat (NATO Warfighting Capstone
Concept, NWCC) in 2021.\[9\] In recent years NATO's military authorities
have thus been establishing the doctrine, goals and capabilities needed
to confront the Russian threat before the political concept that will
require them is approved.

The new military developments are not known in detail given their
confidential nature, but amid a specific threat such as Russia's they
will have been tailor-made to address it, and therefore will be less
reactive than those envisaged in the current Strategic Concept, which
are restricted to awaiting an armed attack before responding. The new
military strategy will need to address the new forms of confrontation in
all domains (land, sea, air, outer space and cyberspace) and in their
conventional and non-conventional forms (hybrid war), a more proactive
and anticipatory shift in focus that now requires a political
justification. As matters stand, the necessity now arises of reconciling
the political component of the Madrid Strategic Concept with the
military strategy already adopted, which could present problems if one
or several allies disagree with the new terms of military planning.

Spain has contributed and will continue to contribute to collective
deterrence on NATO's eastern borders, meaning that it will not be
difficult to adapt itself to the new deterrence and defence guidelines
from a military point of view. It may be more difficult to acknowledge
the Russian Federation as a threat and to act accordingly from the
political perspective, because Spanish strategic culture is reluctant to
put a name to threats to national security and because adopting the
necessary measures would incur major political and economic costs.

Russia, China and strategic competition

The North Atlantic Council described Russia's aggressive conduct as a
'threat' at its June 2021 meeting in Brussels,\[10\] together with
terrorism and other asymmetrical threats such as hybrid threats,
disinformation and cyberattacks. Numerous acts jeopardising
Euro-Atlantic security were listed and laid at Russia's door, and
consequently Russia is going to provide the adversary that the Alliance
lacked in the Lisbon Strategic Concept. With China, the Council's
communiqué was more cautious: the country was described as a 'systemic
challenge' to the international order and it was called upon to behave
more responsibly within this order. However, while the NATO 2030 report
drawn up by a group of experts did not deem China a 'military threat'
like Russia, it placed it on an equal footing in terms of threat to the
security of the Alliance.

The [allies]{.underline}, including Spain, [will need to
endorse]{.underline} the [characterisations in the Madrid Strategic
Concept and]{.underline} the [respective measures]{.underline} to
reverse these types of behaviour. The [measures to be]{.underline}
[taken against the Russian threat]{.underline} already seem to be
[**defined** **in the new allied strategy**]{.underline}, but it remains
to be seen what measures are adopted against China. The allies are faced
with the dilemma of how to address the geopolitical rivalry between
China and the US and to take preventative measures to deter and defend
their security interests against Chinese power in the European region,
the scope of its global capabilities and, above all, the application of
its disruptive technologies to erode NATO's military superiority.\[11\]
In this context, the NATO 2030 report warns about China's strategy of
civil-military fusion, whereby Beijing seeks to acquire the intellectual
copyright and advances of European and Western research centres and
companies with the goal of boosting its own military development.

All the foregoing presents the [Madrid Strategic Concept]{.underline}
with the need to use a public language of diplomacy that explains the
reasons and consequences of [returning to a strategy of **deterrence and
containment**]{.underline}. This constitutes a significant communication
effort because the [allies]{.underline} and their citizens have become
[accustomed over]{.underline} the course of [various decades
to]{.underline} **[prioritise crisis management to]{.underline}** the
**[detriment of collective defence and deterrence]{.underline}**. [It
was a habit they]{.underline} [hurriedly had to abandon in 2014
after]{.underline} the [Russian annexation of Crimea]{.underline} and
required halting the freefall in military spending and committing to
investing 2% of GDP by 2024 (NATO Defence Investment Pledge).
[Spain]{.underline} is not one of the allies most affected by
geographical proximity to Russia or the Asia-Pacific, but it must [share
its allies' concern about]{.underline} the [growing physical presence of
these countries]{.underline} in its space of strategic interest in the
Mediterranean and Africa and about the virtual reach of their hybrid
capabilities to destabilise national security. The tendency of Spanish
strategic culture is inclined to prioritise détente over deterrence, but
it will have to revise this inclination if the Madrid Strategic Concept
incorporates binding containment measures against the Russian and
Chinese threats.

The Alliance's functions

[NATO has three fundamental functions]{.underline}: [collective
defence]{.underline}, [crisis management and]{.underline} [cooperative
security]{.underline}, with none of these taking precedence. The [Madrid
Strategic Concept will have to]{.underline} address the situation on
NATO's eastern flank and experiences such as Afghanistan so as to
**[prioritise collective defence]{.underline}** [against]{.underline}
the [Russian threat]{.underline}, **[to]{.underline}** the
**[detriment]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** its functions of crisis
management and **[cooperative security]{.underline}**. As well as
priorities, the allies [will have to weigh whether]{.underline} [to add
new functions to]{.underline} the [traditional list,]{.underline} and
candidates such as resilience, cybersecurity, pandemics and
technological disruption, among others, are all under consideration.

Prior to the Lisbon Strategic Concept, the usefulness of crisis
management operations --referred to variously as international,
humanitarian or, in Spanish terminology, peace-keeping missions-- was
being called into question. It was agreed in Lisbon to halt combat
missions in Afghanistan in 2014 and promote the construction of local
capabilities as a way of avoiding new interventions within the function
of cooperative security. The outcome of operations in Libya and
Afghanistan had the effect of discrediting the crisis management
function, at least whenever it involves mass troop deployments on the
ground, and the [Madrid Strategic Concept should **reduce**]{.underline}
its **[priority]{.underline}** [compared to deterrence]{.underline},
[which is necessary against the Russian threat,]{.underline} and
cooperative security, which is necessary in order to strengthen local
partnerships.

"We, the Heads of State and Government of the 30 NATO Allies, have met
today to address Russia's aggression against Ukraine, the gravest threat
to Euro-Atlantic security in decades." In this solemn statement released
after an extraordinary summit in Brussels on March 24, 2022, NATO
leaders sent a clear signal: Russia poses an unprecedented threat that
the alliance needs to address as a matter of priority. Beyond its
decisions to assist Ukraine and reassure frontline allies, NATO is also
preparing for the long-term implications of the return of war to the
European continent. Incidentally, this reorientation coincides with the
preparation of a new strategic concept that will be adopted in Madrid.

The strategic concept is arguably NATO's most important political
document as it scans the international security context, identifies the
main threats and challenges to Euro-Atlantic security, and outlines an
approach to addressing such challenges. The previous strategic concept,
adopted in Lisbon in 2010, signaled a meaningful rebalancing among
NATO's so-called core tasks, namely collective defense, crisis
management, and cooperative security. Inter-state competition took a
back seat because the alliance still hoped it could strike a cooperative
relationship with Russia despite the invasion of Georgia in 2008. The
return of great-power competition in Europe---arguably best illustrated
by Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014---forced allies to put
collective defense once again at the center of NATO strategy. Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is further compounding
this shift. A renewed commitment to territorial defense will undoubtedly
be at the forefront of the Madrid strategic concept.

This week, foreign ministers from [NATO's 30 member nations]{.underline}
gathered for a virtual meeting during which they were
[presented]{.underline} with a [lengthy report on the future of the
alliance.]{.underline}

Researched and written over the course of the past year by a team of 10
external experts from different NATO countries, it offered a number of
recommendations for the organization to consider.

The motivation for the report came, in part, from French President
Emmanuel Macron describing NATO as "brain dead" last year. Soon after,
Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced that the organization would
undergo a "period of reflection," during which it would start to chart a
path for the future.

This reflective phase was sorely needed. The last time the alliance
conducted a comprehensive review was in 2010 --- clearly the world has
changed a lot since then.

Debate about the future of NATO is nothing new. It was founded in 1949
as a mechanism to prevent the expansion of the Soviet Union into western
Europe. Since the collapse of the USSR and the end of the Cold War in
the early 1990s, therefore, there has been much discussion about the
organization's relevancy.

Now the [mainstream debate has shifted]{.underline} from whether NATO is
still relevant [to]{.underline} [discussions]{.underline} [about what it
should be doing]{.underline}. Some argue that although the Soviet Union
is gone, [Russia remains the biggest threat]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} that **[collective]{.underline}** and territorial
**[defense]{.underline}** [remains its core task]{.underline}. Others
suggest that NATO must re-tool to become a counterterrorism force and
focus on emerging challenges such as the rise of China.

While the [report]{.underline} published this week
[highlighted]{.underline} the [continued threat posed by Russia to the
alliance]{.underline}, [most of the focus was on dealing with
new]{.underline} and [emerging threats]{.underline} --- and the [two
issues that]{.underline} really stand out are terrorism and China.
Sadly[, the focus on these issues]{.underline} is likely to
[disappoint]{.underline} [many]{.underline}. This is because [NATO was
**neither founded nor designed to confront such threats.**]{.underline}

Take China for example. Among other things, the report states that "NATO
should enhance its ability to coordinate strategy and safeguard allies'
security vis-a-vis China." A sizable section of the report is devoted to
the country, and the word "China" appears no fewer than 62 times
throughout the document.

However, it [fails to acknowledge NATO's **limitations** when it comes
to **confronting non-military threats**]{.underline} originating from
China. Some of the biggest challenges it poses to member states involve
questionable investments in critical infrastructure, disinformation
campaigns, and encroachments in the technology sector using Huawei's 5G
networks.

As an intergovernmental security alliance lacking any legislative
powers, NATO should not pretend to lead on an issue for which it lacks
the necessary policy competencies. While the organization should be
aware of the challenges posed by China, only national capitals, and on
occasion the EU, have the political and economic tools that can address
the non-military threats from Beijing.

Counterterrorism is another issue that received a lot of attention in
the report but which NATO is not fully equipped to address. The authors
state: "NATO should more explicitly integrate the fight against
terrorism into (its) core tasks" --- but again there is no mention of
the limitations that exist.

The organization can be one tool in the box to help confront terrorism
but it cannot itself be the entire toolbox. Sometimes a military
operation is needed to confront terrorists but most of the time it is
not. More often than not, non-military means are the most effective
tools in the fight against terrorism.

This is where NATO is lacking. It does not possess any legislative
powers to confront terrorism, nor does it have the ability to implement
sanctions and block terrorist funding. It also lacks many other
capabilities required to fight terrorism, such as policy competency over
law enforcement, and border and immigration controls.

As long as Russia remains on the march in Central and Eastern Europe, as
it has been in places such as Georgia and the Ukraine, it will remain
the primary military threat to NATO.

Many in North America and Europe are concerned about the terrorist
threat, and reasonably so. While NATO needs to be aware of this concern,
as an alliance it must also be realistic about its ability to conduct
counterterrorism operations. Since the organization lacks many of the
key policy competencies to fight terrorism, the responsibly to do
remains with individual member states.

The report also addresses a number of other issues, ranging from climate
change to the role of women in security.

[When it is all said and done,]{.underline} the
[organization]{.underline} **[really needs to refocus]{.underline}**
**[on]{.underline}** its raison d'etre, which is **[collective
defense]{.underline}**. [It does not have to be present
everywhere]{.underline} in the world, trying to do everything and solve
every problem that exists --- [but it does have to be able to
defend]{.underline} the [territory of member states]{.underline}. Right
now, [there is only one major threat that NATO is fully
equipped]{.underline} [to handle]{.underline} [---]{.underline} and that
is [Russia]{.underline}. The [alliance must **get back to
basics**]{.underline} [and focus on its eastern flank,]{.underline}
where the threat from Moscow remains the top challenge.

Make no mistake, individual member states should be concerned about
issues such as terrorism and China, but NATO as an institution should
not try to take the lead on these.

[As long as Russia remains]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the [march
in]{.underline} Central and [Eastern Europe]{.underline}, as it has been
in places such as Georgia and the [Ukraine, it will remain the **primary
military threat** to NATO]{.underline}. As the organization's
secretary-general considers the recommendations in the report, he must
not forget this important fact.

If [NATO]{.underline} aspires to deal with terrorism and WMD
proliferation, the **[timing and legitimacy of military
force]{.underline}** **[will be a key issue]{.underline}** [on which the
allies have to see eye to eye]{.underline}. But as a look at some core
strategic documents shows, this is not the case today. The EU Security
Strategy of 2003 opens with the sanguine observation that "Europe has
never been so prosperous, so secure, nor so free", whereas the [US
Security Strategy]{.underline} of 2006 starts with the ominous statement
that "America is at war." This [testifies to the potential of
infecting]{.underline} the [Alliance with]{.underline} a level of
[**strategic ~~schizophrenia~~ \[irrationality\]** that is unhealthy and
untenable.,]{.underline}

The current ostrich-reflex, with the head in the sand in the hope that
the problem will go away, will no longer do. A [commitment must be made
to turn NATO into]{.underline} a [true]{.underline}, functioning
political [organisation, prepared to debate]{.underline}
[key]{.underline} [strategic challenges]{.underline} facing the
Alliance. That this is not happening today explains the diverging threat
perceptions which make collective NATO-action problematic. The North
Atlantic Council (NAC), [NATO]{.underline}'s key political governing
body, now [focuses]{.underline} its deliberations [largely
on]{.underline} the [Alliance's on-going operations, with]{.underline}
[**too little time spent on potential crises** lurking over the
horizon]{.underline}. A [new strategic concept should bring]{.underline}
an [end to this **imbalance**]{.underline}, for example by changing
procedures for agenda-setting within the NAC.

Second, **[choices must be made]{.underline}** [regarding NATO's future
as a **defence organisation**]{.underline}. [Obviously]{.underline},
**[collective defence]{.underline}** [remains]{.underline} the [backbone
of the Alliance]{.underline}. [But what does this]{.underline} [mean in
an era where]{.underline} **[energy cut-offs]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} (**[cyber]{.underline}**-)terrorism [are]{.underline}
the [preferred lines of attack]{.underline}? NATO's collective defence
clause under Article 5 was duly invoked after 9/11, which means in
theory that NATO as a whole remains in a quasi-state of war. The [fact
that we simply forget this]{.underline} [indicates]{.underline} that the
[Alliance needs to]{.underline} **[rethink the nature of collective
defence]{.underline}**, its responses, [and]{.underline} the [importance
of]{.underline} **[retooling its operational]{.underline}**
[kit]{.underline} to address new security challenges more effectively.
[NATO]{.underline}'s military operations [suggest]{.underline} a new
[strategy of "forward **defence**]{.underline}", where allied interests
and values are protected "at the Hindukush." [But with]{.underline}
energy security topping the agenda and [relations with Russia at
freezing point]{.underline}, the true, and possibly novel, meaning of
Article 5 requires serious collective thought.

All this implies that [NATO has to **set priorities**]{.underline}. The
expectations--capabilities gap of the Alliance is becoming dangerously
large. As an organisation, [NATO cannot bring]{.underline} [many policy
tools to]{.underline} the [table and depends on member
states']{.underline} willingness to work together and pool their
collective resources and [capabilities]{.underline}. [But]{.underline}
the [continuing acrimony over **funding**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[force generation]{.underline}** [for NATO-led operations
exposes]{.underline} the **[crumbling consensus within the
Alliance]{.underline}**, especially in the case of ISAF. [NATO should
begin to **cut its coat according to its cloth.**]{.underline} The [new
strategic concept should]{.underline} clearly [explain]{.underline}
[what Article 5 means]{.underline} in the 21st century,
[and]{.underline}, based on that new assessment, [set limits to the
scope and nature of NATO-led missions.]{.underline}

Third, NATO should bring its relationship with new, often global
partners and key players like the EU and UN on a new level. In
Afghanistan, ISAF includes crucial allies such as Australia, whose 1000
soldiers are engaged in the country's risky southern province of
Uruzgan. Since [numerous NATO member states remain reluctant to risk
life and]{.underline} [limb in]{.underline} these [dangerous
missions]{.underline}, the [Alliance risks becoming a "**coalition of
the willing**]{.underline}", [which]{.underline} would [undermine
**internal solidarity,**]{.underline} [and hence NATO's raison
d\'être.]{.underline} If NATO chooses to go truly global, it must draw
global partners closer to the organization, and clarify their rights and
obligations under new and transparent rules of the game.

[There is no perfect time for]{.underline} a [strategic extreme makeover
of the Alliance]{.underline}. So today is as good a time as any.

This also applies to NATO's ties with the EU and UN. The Alliance takes
prides in the "comprehensive approach" it takes towards operations. In
reality, however, this can only be realized by bringing the resources of
key international organisations (IOs) such as the EU, UN, and World Bank
into play. This is why these IOs were invited for the first time to
discuss the reconstruction of Afghanistan during NATO's informal meeting
of defence ministers in Noordwijk, in October 2007. Since 21 EU states
are also members of NATO, more coordination and joint action between
both organisations is obviously required.

The Berlin Plus-arrangement foresaw the EU using NATO resources. Now it
is time for a so-called Berlin Plus in reverse, as the Alliance may want
to draw upon EU tools like the European Gendarmerie Force (EGF), as well
as the EU's civilian crisis management capabilities. Since the UN's
Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) now has 90,000 troops
deployed under its authority (based on a US\$ 5 billion annual budget),
NATO-UN ties obviously need to be strengthened and formalized. Numerous
modalities are informally discussed, but choices have to be made
urgently.

Fourth, **[confronting NATO's strategic choices]{.underline}** and
dilemmas head-on [will have a cleansing effect within the
Alliance]{.underline}.

That is why NATO needs policy entrepreneurs who are willing to give the
Alliance a new lease of life and a new focus.

Today, there is [hardly a challenge facing]{.underline} the
[West]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} [has not been
obliged to add to]{.underline} its already [**crowded
agenda**.]{.underline} **[On top of traditional tasks]{.underline}**
[such as territorial]{.underline} [defence]{.underline} and
peacekeeping, the [Alliance]{.underline} now [deals with]{.underline}
WMD proliferation, missile defence and **[cyber-security.]{.underline}**

In its multifunctionality, [NATO]{.underline} begins to
[resemble]{.underline} a [Swiss pocket-knife with all its tools
exposed]{.underline}. But as we all know, unfolded pocket-knives are
unwieldy affairs, and whilst prepared to do everything, are actually
good at nothing. This is why [NATO needs to retool itself]{.underline},
starting [with]{.underline} a [revision of its]{.underline} outdated
[strategic concept.]{.underline}

The current strategic concept, which is the core mission statement of
the Alliance, was adopted in April 1999, in the midst of NATO's
Kosovo-campaign. This key document therefore predates the strategic
paradigm-shift of 9/11, as well as NATO's Afghanistan mission, the first
outside the Euro-Atlantic area.

In the past, allies have not prepared strategic concepts frequently (in
1952, 1967, 1991 and 1999), but history seems to go at fast-forward
speed these days. This is why NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop
Scheffer called for a new strategic concept in February 2007, arguing
that on-going operations in Afghanistan and Kosovo have offered the
Alliance "lessons of 21st century security. We need to enshrine them in
our guiding documents so that they are implemented in practice."

The " if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality underestimates the
strategic challenges facing NATO today

However, many officials in NATO capitals are concerned that the risks of
such a strategic review are too great. They fear that it might revive
the transatlantic controversies of 2002-3, and open wounds that have
just begun to heal. They also suggest that with the Comprehensive
Political Guidance-document that was endorsed in November 2006 at the
Riga Summit, a solution has been found to NATO's predicament.

Still, merely [kicking]{.underline} [the can down the road would be a
serious mistake]{.underline}. This "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"
mentality underestimates the strategic challenges facing NATO today.

In the current debate, German chancellor Angela Merkel is the only
political leader who has clearly stated she would like to see a new
strategic concept endorsed at NATO's Summit in 2009. This will be
difficult to achieve given the electoral calendar in the United States
where a new administration will take office in January 2009, and will
need several months to get a new team together.

Presenting a new strategic concept at NATO's 60th anniversary would be a
welcome birthday present. But [more important than nice timing is
that]{.underline} [at NATO's Summit]{.underline} in Bucharest, [allies
commit themselves to]{.underline} **[biting the bullet]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [doing what is necessary]{.underline}:
[accept]{.underline} the [inconveniences of temporary disagreements and
aim for]{.underline} a [new]{.underline} NATO strategic concept that
clarifies the Alliance's political and **[military
strategy]{.underline}** - and communicates this clearly to the wider
world.

Why? And why now?

The current debate about a new strategic concept is déjà vu to strategic
analysts: all arguments, pro and con, which could be heard in the 1990s,
are now rehearsed. [Why open Pandora's Box?]{.underline}
**[Why]{.underline}** **[waste diplomatic energy]{.underline}** [**that
could be spent on**]{.underline} more important, **[operational
matters]{.underline}**? [Why risk failure by **washing NATO's dirty
linen in public?**]{.underline}

Interestingly, both the 1991 and 1999 strategic concepts were innovative
and instrumental in getting NATO ready for new members and missions. So
recent experience does not support a cautious approach, but rather
suggests that a more daring spirit serves the Alliance well.

Arguably, [NATO is facing a]{.underline} **[litmus test]{.underline}**
[which determines whether the]{.underline} [organization is really still
an "Alliance", based on shared interests]{.underline} and values,
[or]{.underline} **[merely a glorified security
coalition.]{.underline}** There are four pressing reasons why a
strategic recalibration of NATO is required.

To be successful, [NATO needs a **package-deal of painful
compromises**]{.underline}, where each member state has to give and
take.

First, [allies need to find]{.underline} a [workable consensus
about]{.underline} the [legitimacy of using military force]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [non-article 5 operations]{.underline} (i.e., for
purposes other than self-defence), and, in the extreme, even without an
explicit UN Security Council mandate. In a way, this [has
been]{.underline} the most controversial, **[unresolved]{.underline}**
[issue]{.underline} of the 1999 strategic concept, which has gained even
greater relevance with the US invasion of Iraq and the American doctrine
of preventive wars.

**Baltic [info-sharing]{.underline} is sufficient to [deter]{.underline}
Russian [covert activities]{.underline} now BUT vulnerabilities remain
in their [military readiness]{.underline}.**

**Radin, \'15** -- political scientist at the RAND Corporation. His

and peace operations (Andrew Radin; \"Hybrid Warfare in the Baltics\";

Like Crimea and eastern Ukraine, the eastern portions of Estonia and
Latvia are proximate to Russia and do have a significant
Russian-speaking population that might make them similarly vulnerable to
Russian covert action. [In general,]{.underline} however, the [**Baltic
countries**]{.underline} appear to be a **[less fertile ground for
covert subversion]{.underline}** than Ukraine. While Russia was able to
seize and maintain control over Crimea, where its conventional forces
maintained dominance, the success of covert actions in eastern Ukraine
was ultimately less successful, as discussed above. The [Baltic
countries are better positioned]{.underline} than Ukraine [to defend
against]{.underline} and deter [Russian covert action]{.underline}.
[They have greater control over]{.underline} their own
[territory]{.underline}, through the development of their internal
security forces, as outlined below. Furthermore, [they are members of
NATO, and]{.underline} so [benefit from]{.underline} [assistance from
other NATO countries]{.underline}, including under Article 5. Unlike
Ukraine, where NATO support to Ukraine was limited to nonlethal
equipment after Russia used conventional forces to support the
separatists, NATO member countries are committed to respond to an attack
on any of the Baltic states as if it were an attack on themselves.

Indeed, [both Estonian and Latvian Ministry of Defence]{.underline}
officials [indicated **confidence in their ability to deal with covert
Russian activity**]{.underline} because of their greater state capacity
and NATO's conventional deterrent.56 Their policy to address covert
Russian aggression is relatively straightforward---they plan to shoot
the "little green men."57 The [Estonian Chief of Defence
explains]{.underline}, "If Russian agents or special forces enter
Estonian territory, 'you should shoot the first one to appear. . . . If
somebody without any military insignia commits terrorist attacks in your
country you should shoot him . . . you should not allow them to
enter."[58 By rapidly deploying]{.underline} civilian and [military
forces t]{.underline}o quickly [defeat Russian covert
elements]{.underline}, the [Baltic countries]{.underline} [hope to
defeat Russian special forces]{.underline}, [and leave Russia with the
choice of either backing down or risking]{.underline} conventional
escalation that would bring NATO into the war. By relying on NATO to
provide a conventional deterrent, the Baltic states thereby hope to
deter Russian covert action.59

This strategy is uncertain, however. In practice, the Baltic countries
may hesitate before attacking Russian forces operating in their
territory because of fears of Russia's willingness to escalate. Russia
may also be able to seize territory and establish a new status quo
before the Baltic states are able to respond. Indeed, the Baltic
countries recognize the importance of rapidly alerting NATO of Russian
aggression under Article 4 or 5.60 The Baltic countries may also not
receive full NATO support if the presence of Russian forces is ambiguous
and there is reason to believe that opposition is primarily carried out
by Baltic Russian speakers.

Hence, [despite]{.underline} the [confidence of]{.underline} the [Baltic
officials, it remains important to evaluate]{.underline} the
**[readiness, capabilities, and coordination]{.underline}** [of the
security forces in the Baltic countries.]{.underline} Estonia appears
have a relatively well-prepared security structure, albeit small and
dependent on rapid mobilization of reservists. Estonia has an active
duty ground force of 5,500 soldiers, of whom 2,700 are conscripts,
organized into two brigades. With the exception of one professional
highreadiness mechanized battalion, these two brigades are at low
readiness and mainly serve to train conscripts for eight to 11 months
before they are moved into the reserves.61 There are also four teams of
American-trained special operations forces, who have repeatedly deployed
to Afghanistan. The Kaitseliit, a 15,000-strong National Guard, contains
some well-trained and -equipped fighting units that would coordinate
with the special operations forces in the event of an invasion. Based on
their own estimates of Russian special forces capabilities, Estonian
officials claim that a two-battalion force---their own plus a U.S. or
NATO battalion---would be able to hold off Russian special forces, at
least until a broader mobilization occurred.62

Estonian government officials are confident in their ability to monitor
Russian activity within their territory, highlighting the capability of
the Internal Security Service, although it is uncertain how effectively
this information can be shared with other NATO members. A July 2015
visit to Narva revealed a modern multilayered border post that would
require a not insignificant effort to circumvent.63 While Western
officials were skeptical of the extent of coordination between the
Ministry of Defence and internal security forces, [Estonian government
officials claimed]{.underline} that **[coordination was quite
good]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [straightforward]{.underline} in
large part [due to the small size of the Estonian security
establishmen]{.underline}t. [Estonia has undertaken regular war
games]{.underline} and exercises to understand how [to respond to
different forms of Russian aggression]{.underline}, including practicing
handoffs of responsibilities from the internal security forces to the
Ministry of Defence forces [and determining when to seek assistance from
NATO]{.underline}. The [Hedgehog]{.underline} exercise in May 2015, for
example, involved 13,000 Estonian personnel and [revealed gaps in
mobilization times]{.underline} that the [gov]{.underline}ernment [is
currently seeking to address]{.underline}.64

The [**readiness and preparation** of]{.underline} the [Latvian military
is **more questionable**]{.underline}. Despite Latvia's greater
population (2 million compared with 1.3 million in Estonia), Latvian
forces are smaller than Estonia's, in large part because Latvia spends
only 0.94 percent of GDP on defense, in comparison with Estonia's 1.93
percent in 2014.65 Latvia does not have conscription, and the overall
size of the active ground force is 3,900. This force is organized into a
single brigade with two active duty battalions, and also includes highly
trained special forces. Latvia also has a volunteer National Guard of
approximately 8,000.66 [The focus of the military has been on out-of
area NATO deployments]{.underline}, and some Western trained observers
in Riga [have expressed **doubts about the force's
readiness**]{.underline} to counter either serious covert violent action
or a conventional attack.67 [As with Estonia, Latvian]{.underline}
officials were also **[confident of their intel]{.underline}**ligence
**[gathering]{.underline}** [related to Russian covert
actions]{.underline}. They observed that they had dealt with the Russian
covert threat for many years. Although [Latvian defense]{.underline}
officials [noted **good interagency information sharing**]{.underline},
contingency planning, and coordination,68 [Western-trained]{.underline}
[observers]{.underline} [noted]{.underline} serious interagency
coordination problems, including the **[absence of regular
exercises]{.underline}** [to practice crisis coordination]{.underline}
between the Ministry of Defence and internal security forces. Latvian
and foreign observers have also questioned the effectiveness of the
Latvian border guard relative to those of Estonia and the Nordic
countries.69

**Strengthening [conventional defense]{.underline} is key to [keep
up]{.underline} with Russia -- that matters [most]{.underline} for

Key Findings

Current Imbalance of Military Power on the Russian Border a Result of
Different Motivations

In the years following the end of the Cold War, **[NATO\'s ground forces
have substantially declined]{.underline}** in size [and shifted focus
away from]{.underline} [high-intensity conventional combat]{.underline}.

[By contrast]{.underline}, while [Russia]{.underline} also saw a major
decline through the 1990s and 2000s, more-recent [efforts]{.underline}
have [led to]{.underline} effective changes in [Russian warfighting
capabilities]{.underline} [and]{.underline} a gradual [spread of
more-modern systems]{.underline} [to]{.underline} much of the [Russian
armed forces.]{.underline}

[Recent]{.underline} **[improvements to readiness]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} to the [ability to move forces quickly]{.underline}
[within Russia]{.underline}, combined with the density of
anti-access/area denial capabilities arrayed to defend the Russian
heartland, [provide Moscow]{.underline} [with]{.underline} a much
[greater ability to project force against countries on]{.underline} its
[borders]{.underline}.

The [Russian Threat to NATO in the Baltics]{.underline}

[While NATO militaries have retooled]{.underline} to [focus on stability
operations]{.underline} and lighter forces that can be more easily
deployed out of area to such places as Afghanistan, [Russia has
retained]{.underline} a [combined-arms force that]{.underline}
**[emphasizes mobility and firepower]{.underline}** and trains [to
conduct larger-scale]{.underline} combined-[arms operations.
This]{.underline} **[gives Russian forces]{.underline}** an [**important
advantage** in]{.underline} [conflicts between]{.underline} [mechanized
forces]{.underline} **[close to their border]{.underline}**.

There has been a notable increase in the quality of [Russian
forces]{.underline} over the last decade: a [growing]{.underline}
[number of volunteer soldiers]{.underline}, fielding of [modernized
weapons]{.underline}, [improvements to readiness, and **experience
gained from**]{.underline} large-scale exercises and combat operations
in **[Ukraine]{.underline}** and Syria.

The [highest density of Russia\'s most-capable ground and air
forces]{.underline} [is in its]{.underline} Western Military District,
which borders the NATO allies in [Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania]{.underline}, whi[ch have]{.underline} very [small
conventional forces.]{.underline}

[Russia]{.underline}\'s demonstrated [ability to mass ready
forces]{.underline} [from elsewhere within]{.underline} its borders,
leveraging its internal rail and road networks, [means it is likely to
enjoy a significant]{.underline} [time-distance advantage]{.underline}
in generating combat forces [during the opening period of a
crisis.]{.underline}

**Baltic states are [invulnerable]{.underline} to irregular warfare;
Russia will exploit their [conventional inferiority]{.underline} which
risks [nuclear escalation]{.underline}.**

**Radin, \'15** -- political scientist at the RAND Corporation. His
research interests include European security, NATO, and Russia\'s

I find that the [**most significant threat** from Russia to]{.underline}
the [Baltics]{.underline} **[lies in Russia's conventional
forces]{.underline}**, **[not]{.underline}** its capacity for
**[irregular warfare]{.underline}** [or political
subversion]{.underline}. I divide potential Russian aggression in the
Baltics into three distinct categories of scenarios: nonviolent
subversion, covert violent actions, and conventional warfare supported
by political subversion. I find that the [Baltic countries are
not]{.underline} especially [vulnerable to nonviolent]{.underline} [or
covert violent actions]{.underline} by Russia. Given the loyalty of many
Russian speakers in the Baltics to their home countries, and their
greater economic well-being within the EU, [Russia will have difficulty
provoking large-scale protests]{.underline} or separatist movements.
Covert violent Russian actions are also unlikely to succeed, given
preparations in these countries to deploy security forces sufficient to
either defeat Russian covert forces or compel Russia to escalate to
conventional war. A [large-scale conventional Russian
incursion]{.underline} into the Baltics [would]{.underline} almost
inevitably [be hybrid]{.underline} in the sense that it would include
some effort at political subversion. [Nevertheless]{.underline}, the
**[danger of such an attack lies in NATO's local conventional
inferiority]{.underline}**, [not]{.underline} in [Russian]{.underline}
propaganda or [proxy warfare,]{.underline} and as such [NATO needs to
establish]{.underline} a [more]{.underline} **[credible conventional
deterrent]{.underline}**.

The limited vulnerability to irregular warfare does not mean that a U.S.
or NATO policy can focus exclusively on conventional warfare in
deterring or defeating Russian aggression. Effective defense of the
Baltics depends on reducing vulnerabilities to all forms of Russian
aggression. The greater the perceived vulnerabilities of the Baltic
countries to a particular form of aggression, the more likely that
Russia is to undertake it. Even if the objective risk of success is
limited, Russia could miscalculate or determine that the possible
benefit is great enough that risk is justified. Alternatively, [war or
conflict could emerge by accident]{.underline}. [Russia and NATO forces
could]{.underline} [unintentionally come into conflict]{.underline},
[as]{.underline} they did [when Turkish forces shot down]{.underline} a
[Russian plane]{.underline} in November 2015. Or, Russia could become
involved if groups allied with the Russian state, but not controlled by
them, engage in aggressive action.5 The [failure of Russian-backed armed
groups]{.underline} [could lead Russia to escalate]{.underline} to avoid
defeat, [a cycle which could lead to]{.underline} [large-scale conflict
and]{.underline} even **[nuclear use]{.underline}**. Hence, [even if
Russia prefers to avoid conflict]{.underline}, a [crisis
could]{.underline} nevertheless [emerge]{.underline}.
[Strengthening]{.underline} the overall [resilience of the Baltic
States]{.underline} can [reduce]{.underline} the [risk of]{.underline}
low-level aggression and [unintentional escalation]{.underline}.

I conclude this report by suggesting several implications for U.S. and
NATO policies [to limit]{.underline} the potential for [Russian hybrid
aggression]{.underline}. First, with regard to nonviolent subversion,
pressure from Western allies to improve language and citizenship rights
for Russians in the Baltics is probably impractical. Instead, the United
States and NATO should pursue the development of a more sophisticated
and subtle strategic communication campaign, starting with supporting
local Russian-language broadcasters within the Baltic countries.

Second, with regard to covert violent action, [continued support for the
Baltic countries' security forces is]{.underline} clearly
[beneficial]{.underline}. The U.S. [Air Force can]{.underline} help
improve the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities
of the Baltic states by **[strengthen]{.underline}**ing their
**[technical capabilities]{.underline}** [for border
control]{.underline} and [air and maritime]{.underline} domain
[awareness]{.underline}. NATO and its member states can also do more to
share intelligence of Russian policies and actions and help conduct
whole-of-government exercises to better prepare for covert or denied
Russian aggression. Additional research would also be beneficial to
develop and evaluate responses to a wide range of Russian covert
tactics.

[Third]{.underline}, in [developing]{.underline} a **[credible
conventional deterrent in the Baltics]{.underline}**, the United States
and NATO should attempt to reduce the risk of low-intensity conflict.
While there is no way to definitively prevent Russia or Russian speakers
in the region from misperceiving NATO's intent, the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and NATO may be able to deploy forces]{.underline}
in a way [that]{.underline} would [reduce]{.underline} the [risk of
Russian aggression]{.underline} or subversion. [Such
actions]{.underline} may [include]{.underline} [avoiding basing forces
in areas dominated by Russian speakers]{.underline}, increasing
transparency, limiting activities that appear intended to achieve regime
change in Russia, and developing a comprehensive public relations
campaign aimed at the Baltic Russian speakers.

their [local conventional forces]{.underline}.**

A [final category of hybrid warfare involves]{.underline} a
[conventional attack]{.underline} by Russian ground, air, naval, and
airborne forces, [justified]{.underline} and legitimized [by
covert]{.underline} or denied [activities]{.underline} focused on the
Russian speakers. Such an attack could seek to capture territory,
replace the government of the Baltic countries, or shift the military
balance in an ongoing internal conflict, as in eastern Ukraine. [Even
if]{.underline} the [value to Russia of occupying the Baltic countries
is low]{.underline}, Russia could seek to demonstrate that NATO's
security guarantees are not credible and the United States is unable to
defend its allies.

[Russian conventional forces]{.underline} could adopt a range of courses
of action. They might [seek to drive ground forces across]{.underline}
the [Baltic countries to their capitals]{.underline}, and attempt to
seize the countries before a significant Western response. Russian
forces might limit their offensive to a small "bite" of the Baltic
countries, capturing a Russian-dominated city near the border, such as
Narva, or an area of strategic importance, such as a land bridge between
Belarus and Kaliningrad. Russia may [bargain that NATO is unwilling to
risk war]{.underline} to recapture an area of strategic importance to
Russia, or a Russian-dominated territory where there is some ambiguity
about whether there is support for Russian action by the local
population. Russia would likely use its anti-access and area-denial
capabilities to inhibit NATO deployments in the region and give it more
time to consolidate its gains. However [Russia uses its conventional
forces, it will]{.underline} likely **[threaten the use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** to deter a response from NATO. [Russia has
discussed the possibility of]{.underline} **[deploying tactical nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** to Crimea [and]{.underline} **[nuclear-capable
ballistic Iskander missiles]{.underline}** [to Kaliningrad]{.underline},
and emphasized that it would use such weapons to defend its territory.
[Russia would]{.underline} likely [do the same if it attacked the
Baltics]{.underline}.70

RAND has recently undertaken a series of tabletop exercises to better
understand the prospects for a Russian conventional attack in the
Baltics. Based on open source estimates, Russia could muster
approximately 27 maneuver battalion tactical groups to attack the Baltic
countries in a short-warning attack, supported by significant long-range
fires. Assuming a week of warning, NATO could deploy 12 maneuver
battalions. NATO forces, however, would be light, outgunned, and
outmaneuvered by Russian heavier units, and fixed in place or destroyed
while Russian forces maneuvered toward the capitals. Furthermore, while
NATO could deploy significant air forces, without heavy NATO ground
forces present, Russia would have significant freedom to deploy its
forces to limit its vulnerability to air power. Across multiple
iterations of the scenario, Russian forces were on the outskirts of Riga
and Tallinn between 36 and 60 hours after the start of the war. It would
likely take at least several weeks until armored reinforcements from the
United States could arrive in numbers that would be capable of ejecting
Russian forces.

By that point, NATO may be reluctant to risk nuclear war and bear the
heavy casualties necessary to retake the Russian-occupied areas in the
Baltics.71 The success of Russia's actions in the "small bite" scenario
may vary depending on the degree of surprise, but the chances for
Russia's conventional success in the short term appear high, given the
substantial numerical superiority of Russian conventional forces in the
region.

While Russia could theoretically only use conventional forces and eschew
political subversion or covert action, these unconventional tactics have
the potential to reduce the likelihood of a NATO response. Russia could
provoke a conflict between Russian speakers and the Baltic governments,
which may create the perception that local Russian speakers support
Russian military action. Because the North Atlantic Council makes
decisions based on consensus, any disagreement about Russian intent
could delay or vitiate a NATO-backed response to Russian provocations.
Russian leaders made an extensive effort to rationalize and justify
their actions in Crimea, and it seems likely that Russian aggression in
the future would be accompanied by similar activities to justify their
actions.72 Russian covert action could also be used to delay or
undermine the Baltic countries' ability to deploy their security forces
to respond to Russian forces.

Even in the absence of consensus within the North Atlantic Council,
individual member states could come to the defense of the Baltics under
Article 5, which states that each member state can take "such action at
it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and
maintain the security of the North Atlantic area."73 So long as the
United States is willing to respond, and the transit countries of
Germany and Poland permit the U.S. deployment, opposition from other
member states cannot prevent a large-scale military response to a
potential Russian invasion.

In summary, the [**greatest danger** posed by Russia]{.underline} [in
the Baltics **appears to be**]{.underline} its **[local conventional
superiority]{.underline}**. [Without]{.underline} the
[threat]{.underline} or actual use [of]{.underline} a [conventional
attack]{.underline} [to inhibit]{.underline} a [decisive
response]{.underline} [to Russian subversion]{.underline}, the [efficacy
of]{.underline} nonviolent or [covert efforts]{.underline} would be
[limited against]{.underline} competent states such as the
[Baltics]{.underline}. [Offsetting]{.underline} [Russia's geographic
advantages with]{.underline} a **[strengthened NATO defense
posture]{.underline}** may therefore [be]{.underline} the [essential
precondition for]{.underline} [maintaining]{.underline} political
[stability]{.underline} in this region. The nature of such a deterrent
is the focus on other research and beyond the scope of this report.74 It
suffices to note that such a [deterrent]{.underline} [will]{.underline}
likely [involve]{.underline} a **[significant deployment of NATO
forces]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} the region. The [Baltic
countries]{.underline}, for example, have requested that the United
States permanently deploy a U.S. Army battalion in each country.
Determining the types and numbers of forces and where they will be
deployed will have important ramifications for the relations between the
Russian speakers and their governments.

The security and prosperity of the transatlantic community, including
the United States, rests on the foundation of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). Russia's ongoing war of naked aggression against
Ukraine, a NATO non-member state, should put to rest any lingering
questions about the modern utility of the Alliance and about which
threat should be the focus of NATO's upcoming strategic concept.

The answer is clear: The U.S. must lead the Alliance to a wholesale
refocusing on the organization's raison d'être of collective defense.
While the Alliance faces challenges emanating from an unstable
Mediterranean basin and terrorism originating from the Middle East, the
fact remains that Russia continues to be the only existential threat to
member states. NATO must send a strong signal that it is strengthening
deterrence measures explicitly in response to the increased threat from
Russia.

Deterrence measures should include an Alliance-wide recommitment to
defense spending; a persistent and continuing U.S. presence in Eastern
European member states; updated Alliance operational planning in light
of Russia's position in Belarus and Ukraine; and an increase in U.S.
air, ground, and naval forces in the European theater as a sign of
continued commitment to the NATO treaty's Article 5.

These deterrence measures must be carried out with the recognition that,
from a long-term perspective, China is the largest peer challenger from
whom the U.S. must expect hostile action. Any improvements to the U.S.
force posture must not be to the detriment of the nation's ability to
counter China.

The Importance of NATO Deterrence Has Only Increased

From the Arctic to the Levant, Russia remains an aggressive and capable
threat to NATO and the interests of its members. For member states in
Eastern Europe, Russia represents a real and potentially existential
threat. Russia's entrenched position in Belarus, along with its ongoing
actions to cleave Ukraine, a nation that borders four NATO members, in
two, scramble the geostrategic map of Europe and necessitate changes to
NATO operational planning, exemplifying the need for the Alliance to
take swift and resolute steps to bolster deterrence measures along its
eastern flank.

Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine will hopefully be the push that
some allies need to finally live up to their commitments to the NATO
defense spending benchmark. As an intergovernmental security alliance,
NATO is only as strong as its member states. Weak defense spending on
the continent has led to a significant loss of capabilities and
embarrassing gaps in readiness for NATO allies. As a result, American
Presidents of both political parties have long called for increases in
defense spending by NATO allies.

Although most are familiar with Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty---an attack on one is an attack on all---Article 3 is the most
important when it comes to the overall health of the Alliance. Article 3
states that member states, at a minimum, will "maintain and develop
their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack." Only a
handful of NATO members can legitimately say that they are living up to
their Article 3 commitment.

In 2006, in an effort to encourage defense investment, NATO set a target
for its 30 member states to spend 2 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) on defense. At the 2014 Wales Summit, member states recommitted to
spending 2 percent of GDP on defense and committed to spending 20
percent of their defense budgets on "major equipment" purchases by 2024.

NATO allies have made real and sustained increases in defense spending
in recent years, but it is far from enough. In 2021, 10 members of the
Alliance spent 2 percent of GDP on defense, and 24 members met the 20
percent benchmark.1

Procuring capabilities does not happen overnight, and allies in NATO
must commit today to investing the necessary political and economic
capital to fulfill their Article 3 treaty commitments.

U.S. Deployments in Europe Can Magnify NATO Deterrence

U.S. basing structures in Europe harken back to a time when Denmark,
West Germany, and Greece represented the front lines of freedom. The
security situation in Europe has changed, not least of which due to
Russia's force posture in Belarus and occupied portions of Ukraine. The
U.S. must account for this shift by establishing a persistent and
continuing military presence in allied nations further east. A robust
presence displays the long-term U.S. resolve to live up to its NATO
treaty commitments. The U.S. should lead by example, while also
encouraging other NATO allies to base forces in Eastern European member
states.

Over the course of the past few weeks, the U.S. has deployed additional
rotational forces in Europe. On Thursday, 7,000 troops from the Army's
First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, deployed to bases in Germany.2

Helene Cooper, "Pentagon Orders 7,000 More Troops to Europe," The New
York Times, February 24, 2022,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/us/politics/us-troops-deploy-europe.html
(accessed February 25, 2022).﻿

In total, the U.S. has deployed an additional 14,000 troops to Europe in
response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. The U.S. has also redeployed
aircraft further east on a temporary basis, including 20 Apache
helicopters (AH-64s) based in Germany deploying to Baltic allies, 12
AH-64s based in Greece deploying to Poland,3

and six F-35 fighter jets from Utah deploying temporarily to bases in
Estonia, Lithuania, and Romania.4

Furthermore, two B-52s from the 5th Bomb Wing deployed on a
"long-planned Bomber Task Force Europe mission over the Arctic and
Baltic Sea regions."5

Ibid.﻿

Earlier in February, the U.S. deployed 3,000 forces to Poland and
Romania to bolster deterrence and aid in preparations for refugees
crossing the border from Ukraine. The U.S. Department of Defense noted
that "\[t\]hese moves are temporary in nature, and are part of the more
than 90,000 U.S. troops already in Europe on rotational and permanent
orders."

Some NATO allies have also increased their presence further east.
Germany, which serves as the framework nation in Lithuania for NATO's
enhanced forward presence battalion stationed there, added 350 troops.6

NATO allies have battlegroups stationed in Estonia (U.K.-led), Latvia
(Canadian-led), and Poland (U.S.-led); France has offered to lead a
similar battalion in Romania, and stated that it is "accelerating" the
deployment of forces to the nation.7

On Friday, NATO activated its Very High Readiness Joint Taskforce
(VJTF), with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stating: "We are now
deploying the NATO response force for the first time in the context of
collective defense."8

NATO will partially deploy a portion of the VJTF to Eastern Europe; the
deployment will include air, land, and naval assets.9

A second option, emphasized by the Pentagon's 2018 Nuclear Posture
Review, would be to devise new limited nuclear options as a way of
strengthening deterrence and dissuading Russia from pursuing a strategy
of escalate to de-escalate. For example, the US might develop low-yield
nuclear weapons that could be used, in a relatively limited fashion,
against a Russian invasion force or the units supporting it.

This approach is probably worthwhile, because it would help fill in
missing steps on the escalatory ladder between conventional conflict and
general nuclear war. The knowledge that the US has its own "tactical"
nuclear options might inject greater caution into the calculations of
Russian planners. It is possible, RAND analysts note, that limited
nuclear strikes early in a Baltic conflict could convince the Kremlin
that the risks of proceeding are unacceptable.

The dangers here are, well, obvious and drastic. There is always some
possibility --- although informed analysts debate how much of a
possibility --- that Russia might mistake a limited strike against
military targets in the Baltics for part of a larger or more dangerous
nuclear strike against Russia itself. And if the plan is to use limited
nuclear strikes against Russian military assets involved in an invasion
of the Baltic states, the implication is that NATO would be using
nuclear weapons on the territory of its own members.

A third, and best, option is to strengthen the weak conventional posture
that threatens to bring nuclear options into play. The root of NATO's
nuclear dilemma in the Baltics is that the forces it currently has
stationed there cannot put up a credible defense. Yet as earlier studies
have noted, the US and its allies could make a Russian campaign far
harder and costlier --- with a much-diminished chance of rapid success
--- by deploying an enhanced NATO force of seven to eight brigade combat
teams, some 30,000 troops. That force would include three or four
armored brigade combat teams (as opposed to the one NATO periodically
deploys to Eastern Europe now), along with enhanced mobile air defenses
and other critical capabilities.

Russia couldn't claim credibly that such troops posed any real offensive
threat to its territory. But the force would be large and robust enough
that Russian troops couldn't destroy it in a flash or bypass it at the
outset of a conflict. It would therefore obviate many of the nuclear
escalation dynamics by making far less likely a situation in which NATO
must escalate to avoid a crippling defeat in the Baltics, or one in
which Russia can escalate to protect its early victories there.

Developing this stronger conventional deterrent in the Baltics would not
be cheap: Estimates run from \$8 billion to \$14 billion in initial
costs, plus \$3 billion to \$5 billion in annual operating expenses. Yet
neither would it be prohibitive for the richest alliance in the world.
The best way of reducing the danger of a nuclear war in the Baltics is
to ensure that NATO won't immediately lose a conventional one.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Brussels on June
14, 2021, offers an opportunity for the Alliance to continue its focus
on bolstering collective defense in the Baltic region. While great
strides have been made over the past seven years to deter Russian
aggression, the effort is far from complete. The Alliance must keep a
focus on the region, avoiding any premature belief that additional
measures are no longer necessary.

The Baltic region is one of the most complex regions that the Alliance
is obligated to defend. While small in size and population, the Baltic
states represent something much bigger geopolitically: They are staunch
defenders of economic freedom, liberal democracy, and human rights. They
experienced Russian treachery during more than five decades of Soviet
occupation in ways that few other countries did. This horrific
experience means that the Baltic states do not take for granted the
democracy, liberty, and security they enjoy today.

Defending the Baltic states and deterring Russian aggression will be far
easier and cheaper than liberating them. In Brussels, the U.S. must
ensure that NATO thinks strategically about continuing to put in place
durable, robust measures to deter Russian aggression in the region.
Deterrence requires more than token actions; it requires a sustained
commitment to reinforcing the security of the Baltic region while
addressing the Baltics' unique security challenges.

A Complex Region

The Baltic region presents distinctive military and political
difficulties that NATO needs to overcome. These challenges include:

The Baltic states' geographical isolation. Militarily speaking, the
three Baltic states---Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania---are isolated from
other NATO members. To the north of the Baltic states are non-NATO, but
friendly, Finland and Sweden. To the south and east are Russia and
Belarus. To the west, Lithuania shares a border with the Russian exclave
of Kaliningrad. Only Lithuania shares a land border with another
non-Baltic NATO member---a 65-mile border with Poland, to the southwest
between Kaliningrad and Belarus, known as the Suwalki Gap.

The Baltic states' small size. The Baltic states are small in population
and size. Combined, the three have roughly the same geographic size and
population as Missouri. The Baltic region is probably the only region
inside NATO that is too small to depend on rapid reaction forces based
elsewhere for its defense.

The Baltic states' inability to reinforce their defenses. Key to any
potential liberation of the Baltic states would be the swift arrival of
robust reinforcements and equipment to the region. However, contested
airspace, especially in light of Russia's anti-access, area-denial
(A2/AD) capabilities in the region, would make reinforcing the region
difficult---if not initially impossible. Even NATO's Joint Air Power
Strategy cautions that "the future operating environment may be one in
which air superiority can neither be assured at the onset of operations
nor, once obtained, be an enduring condition."1

North Atlantic Treaty Organization, "NATO's Joint Air Power Strategy,"
June 26, 2018,
https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2018​\_06/20180626_20180626-joint-air-power-strategy.pdf
(accessed June 28, 2018).

NATO's critical dependence on non-NATO countries. While not impossible,
it would be extremely difficult for NATO to respond to an incident in
the Baltic region without the acquiescence of non-NATO Finland and
Sweden.

Important Progress Has Been Made

NATO has taken good steps for safeguarding the Baltic region in recent
years, including the adoption of a new defense plan for the Baltics and
Poland in July 2020.2

"NATO Puts Defence Plan for Poland, Baltics into Action, Officials Say,"
Reuters, July 2, 2020,
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-baltics-turkey​/nato-puts-defence-plan-for-poland-baltics-into-action-officials-say-idUSKBN24320B
(accessed May 26, 2021).

The four Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) multinational battalions
stationed in Poland and the Baltic states, announced in 2016, have so
far been a success. The U.S. serves as the framework nation for the
battle group in Poland, the United Kingdom is in Estonia, Canada is in
Latvia, and Germany is in Lithuania. EFP troops are under NATO command
and control; a multinational divisional headquarters located in Elblag,
Poland, coordinates the four battalions.

One issue that remains controversial within the Alliance is the question
of permanently stationing NATO troops in the Baltic states. The only way
to guarantee the security of the Baltic states against a conventional
Russian military threat is by having robust troops and military
capabilities on the ground. The Baltic states are too small to rely on a
strategy of defensive depth that could buy NATO enough time to mobilize
and deploy a sizable force to the region.

In order to protect NATO's pre-positioned equipment, rotational troops,
and key infrastructure and transport nodes required for rapid
reinforcements in the Baltic region, NATO needs to develop a strategy
promoting air defense, not just air policing. In 2020, NATO scrambled
jets 350 times for Russian aircraft approaching or violating NATO
airspace, many of these incidents in the Baltic region.3

News release, "NATO Intercepts Hundreds of Russian Military Jets in
2020," North Atlantic Treaty Organization, December 28, 2020,
https://www.nato​.int/cps/en/natohq/news_180551.htm?selectedLocale=en
(accessed May 14, 2021).

Air defense would require a robust fast-jet and airborne surveillance
presence in addition to air defense assets. Despite positive discussions
and aspirational talk, NATO has not agreed on a common position for a
Baltic Air Defense.

Another matter to consider is the role of the Kaliningrad oblast in
regional security. Kaliningrad is a small Russian exclave along the
Baltic Sea (slightly larger than Connecticut), bordering both Lithuania
and Poland. Kaliningrad is part of Russia's Western Military District,
and approximately 25,000 Russian soldiers and security personnel are
stationed there. It is home to Russia's Baltic fleet, which consists of
around 50 vessels, including submarines. Perhaps most important for
Moscow is that Kaliningrad is at the heart of Russia's A2/AD strategy.

Russia's permanent stationing of Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad in
2018 occurred a year to the day after NATO's EFP deployed to Lithuania.4

Sergey Sukhankin, "Kaliningrad: From Boomtown to Battle-Station,"

https://www.ecfr.eu​/article/commentary_kaliningrad_from_boomtown_to_battle_station_7256
(accessed June 20, 2019).

Iskander missiles can carry nuclear or conventional warheads and have a
range of 250 miles, placing Riga, Vilnius, and Warsaw within their
reach.

Russia reportedly has deployed tactical nuclear weapons, the S-400 air
defense system, and P-800 anti-ship cruise missiles to Kaliningrad.5

Michael Krepon and Joe Kendall, "Beef Up Conventional Forces; Don't
Worry About a Tactical Nuke Gap," Breaking Defense, March 28, 2016,

(accessed June 20, 2019), and ibid.

Russia also has facilities for storage of tactical nuclear weapons in
Kaliningrad. Russia is modernizing runways at its Chernyakhovsk and
Donskoye air bases in Kaliningrad, providing Russia with nearby bases
from which to fly near NATO airspace.

Many of the aerial incidents that cause NATO planes from Baltic Air
Policing to scramble involve Russian planes flying from or to bases in
Kaliningrad. Additionally, Russia plans to re-establish a tank brigade
and a "fighter aviation regiment and naval assault aviation (bomber)
regiment" in Kaliningrad and to re-equip the artillery brigade with new
systems.6

Keeping a Baltic Focus

While progress in defending the Baltics has been made, the Alliance
should not become complacent. Rather, NATO should use the upcoming
Brussels Summit to:

Prepare to reinforce the Baltic defenses quickly. The exercise Defender
Europe 20 focused on large-scale troop movements from the U.S. to the
Baltic region and Poland, and, despite being scaled back due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, was successful. The U.S. and NATO should analyze
lessons from Defender Europe 20 (and the ongoing Defender Europe 21 with
a focus on the Balkans and Black Sea), identifying roadblocks and
implementing fixes.

Maintain the military-mobility focus. NATO must ensure that the Baltic
states have the infrastructure and ability to receive large numbers of
forces and their equipment. Improving military mobility is one security
vector where the Alliance and European Union cooperation could bring
positive results.

establish a larger and more permanent presence on their territory
following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania --- with a combined population of only
about six million people --- have long been seen as some of NATO's most
vulnerable nations. The countries joined the Western military alliance
in 2004 but are connected to the rest of European NATO countries by only
a narrow corridor, which lies between the heavily armed Russian exclave
of Kaliningrad and Russia-allied Belarus.

The Baltics, former Soviet states, have watched with concern as Moscow
tries to reassert influence across Eastern Europe. However, they have
also been encouraged as Western countries fortify the NATO alliance in
response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

NATO had no forces in the eastern part of the alliance until 2014, when
it decided to deploy four multinational battlegroups on a rotational
basis to the Baltics and Poland in response to Russia's annexation of
Crimea. The NATO presence was further strengthened this year after
Russia attacked Ukraine. In total, the Baltics now host about7,700
foreign NATO troops --- nearly twice as many compared to earlier this
year.

But even with those reinforcements, NATO forces in the Baltics likely
could not defeat a large-scale Russian invasion, Baltic leaders warn.
"If we want to be ready from the first minute of any kind of attack to
defend our citizens, and if you want to give citizens of Latvia the same
feeling of security as the citizens of France, Britain, Spain, (and)
Germany...then there must be this permanent presence and more firepower
and capabilities," Latvian Minister of Defense Artis Pabriks told VOA in
an interview.

Artis Pabriks, Latvia\'s Minister of Defense, tells VOA that if Russia
does not like NATO expansion, then Moscow can stop threatening its
smaller neighbors. March 18, 2022.

Baltic leaders have long pushed for a permanent basing of U.S. troops,
seeing it as the ultimate deterrent against a Russian invasion.
Currently, U.S. troops are part of NATO's Baltic rotational
battlegroups, which are led by Germany, Britain, and Canada. During a
Baltics tour earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
said "more permanent deployments" were being considered as part of a
larger review of NATO's defense posture. He did not offer details. But
the United States has been reluctant to permanently station forces on
Russia's doorstep, fearing it would further upset relations with Moscow.

Many Baltic leaders hope a permanent NATO presence will be discussed
this week when U.S. President Joe Biden visits Brussels, Belgium, for
meetings with NATO and other European leaders. Asked about Biden's
visit, Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs Edgars Rinkēvičs told VOA he
believes "it is time that NATO states clearly that (its) presence in the
Baltic states and Poland and Romania, in what we call the 'eastern
flank,' is permanent."

Edgars Rinkēvičs, Latvia\'s Minister of Foreign Affairs, speaks to VOA
on March 18, 2022. Rinkēvičs wants a permanent NATO presence on the
alliances eastern flank.

Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Eva-Maria Liimets also told VOA she
hopes NATO leaders meeting in June in Spain will "make permanent
decisions about how to strengthen defense and deterrence posture in our
region." Even though she conceded Estonia does not currently face a
"direct military threat," she said Europe's security situation "has
changed as a whole and therefore we must continue to strengthen the
defense and deterrence posture of NATO so that we would be more
protected."

It's not clear what a more permanent NATO presence in the Baltics would
entail in terms of weapons. During the Cold War, the United States
alleviated European security fears by positioning tactical nuclear
weapons in countries such as Germany, pointed out Dan Plesch, a
professor of diplomacy at the SOAS University of London. "Is that what
is going to satisfy (Baltic) security concerns?" Plesch asked in an
interview with VOA.

The Baltic nations are already protected by NATO's commitment to defend
its members in the event of an attack. NATO also has overwhelming air
power superiority that would factor into any battle with Russia in the
Baltics, Plesch pointed out. And at the moment, he added, Russia's
military looks even weaker than normal after sustaining significant
losses in Ukraine.

Eva-Maria Liimets, Estonia\'s Minister of Foreign Affairs, hopes a NATO
meeting in June will \"make permanent decisions\" about how to
strengthen Baltic security. Interview with VOA on March 14, 2022.

The challenge is how to address Baltic security concerns while avoiding
steps that would lead to a more unstable situation with Russia in the
future. But with NATO and Russia each blaming the other for creating
instability in Eastern Europe, that may be a difficult task.

Any NATO expansion is sensitive for Russian President Vladimir Putin,
who cited the issue as a justification, among others, for his invasion
of Ukraine. Putin still fumes over the Baltics' decision to join NATO,
seeing it as a betrayal of Western promises. Analysts say he would
likely see the establishment of a permanent NATO presence in Eastern
Europe as a violation of past agreements, including the 1997 NATO-Russia
Founding Act (NRFA).

However, those agreements "can be regarded in significant part as null
and void given Russian actions," Plesch said. Another factor: the NRFA
is not a legally binding document, added Mary Elise Sarotte, a Cold War
historian and professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of
Advanced International Studies. "This reality gives the alliance
flexibility with regard to NRFA's terms," she told VOA by email.

Experts are mixed when it comes to predicting whether NATO will
establish a permanent presence in the Baltics anytime soon. According to
Plesch, much depends on how the situation in Ukraine progresses. Sarotte
said it depends on how "permanent" is defined, but that "it is clear
that a larger NATO presence in the east will happen, and will endure."

In the view of Pabriks, the Latvian defense minister, NATO's new
approach to the Baltics should mean "much more capabilities, a classical
strong presence in the region and also support to our national armies."
If Russia does not like the prospect of a more powerful NATO, he said,
then it can always choose to "not threaten its neighbors."

The recent NATO summit in [[Brussels]{.underline}]{.mark} was, by and
large, a big disappointment. Its big "achievement" was the misguided
[[adoption of a climate change agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}. At best,
that agenda is a [distraction from]{.underline} the [critical security
challenges]{.underline} facing the alliance. At worst, it will actively
[undermine the alliance's ability to defend its member
states.]{.underline}

For quite some time, NATO has been grappling with divergent threat
perceptions among its member states. The summit did nothing to reconcile
or systematize these views. Instead, the alliance opted for an umbrella
approach where every threat is deemed equally acute.

This **[[oversized umbrella]{.underline}]{.mark}** may have kept
everyone's threat perceptions dry for [now]{.underline}, however,
[[there is **only so much focus, money, and**]{.mark} **political
[willpower]{.mark}**]{.underline} to go around. Sooner or later the
[[alliance]{.mark} will [need to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[prioritize]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

For those nearest Russia, it's crystal-clear Putin is not only NATO's
greatest threat, but also one which the alliance is best suited to
confront. In the 21st century, NATO needs to return to basics, with
territorial defense as its primary goal. **[[NATO cannot try to
be]{.mark} [everywhere]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the world [doing
everything [all the time]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Keeping Russia
at bay requires]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[alliance to
address]{.underline}]{.mark} the full range of Russian aggressions
against NATO members: [[aerial incursions]{.underline},
[cyber-attacks]{.underline},]{.mark} [energy coercion]{.underline},
[espionage]{.underline}, and [propaganda]{.underline}. It must also be
able to deter Russia's use of conventional and nuclear arms.

Facing daily arrivals of migrants from North Africa, our Mediterranean
allies view migration and terrorism as NATO's greatest security threat.
And then there is the gnawing reality of China's rise, with its
implications for transatlantic security. These are secondary threats to
the alliance. Nonetheless, NATO has some (albeit limited) role to play
in keeping them in check.

Yet in the Brussels Summit Communiqué, [**[climate change gets top
billing]{.underline}** [as]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [threat to the
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. This suggests that NATO, now with Team
Biden calling the shots, views climate as NATO's greatest threat, or at
least [as important as]{.underline} the other threats mentioned:
[Russia, China, instability]{.underline} [in Europe's]{.underline} near
abroad, [and]{.underline} the [proliferation]{.underline} of weapons of
mass destruction.

At the summit, [NATO]{.underline} adopted a "Climate Change and Security
Action Plan." Among other things, it [commits]{.underline} the [alliance
to]{.underline} conducting an "annual Climate Change and Security Impact
Assessment" and to mapping and [analyzing greenhouses gases]{.underline}
[from military installations]{.underline} and military activities.
"Furthermore," the plan states, "data on energy demand and consumption
in the military could inform Allies' investment decisions, help define
the role of Emerging Disruptive Technologies and innovative energy
efficient and sustainable technologies, as well as inform operational
planning."

The Summit Declaration goes further, inviting the Secretary General to
"formulate a realistic, ambitious and concrete target for the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions by the NATO political and military
structures and facilities and assess the feasibility of reaching
net-zero emissions by 2050."

This is not to say that climate change isn't real, nor that it has
implications for NATO member states or theaters (particularly the
Arctic). NATO, however, is not the right organization to lead on
addressing these issues.

There is now a very real possibility that the alliance's new climate
focus, with its reporting and consultation requirements, will become a
distraction which undermines collective defense.

Worse yet, NATO's drive to hit arbitrary emission targets could lead
some nations to make choices which weaken transatlantic security. Why
invest in emissions belching tanks when you can buy light armored cars?
Why invest in fifth-generation fighters when many new aircraft consume
more fuel than older platforms? Why invest in capabilities at all when
you can invest in carbon capture technology and wind farms?

Scaling up to challenge Russia's increased presence in the High North?
Expect headwinds ahead under NATO's climate turn. How about joint
exercises, the lifeblood of NATO's continued interoperability and
readiness? Could they one day be reduced to lower emissions?

And what of the alliance's adversaries? The idea that Russia, the
world's fourth-largest carbon emitter, or China, the world's largest
emitter by far, are going to allow emissions targets and climate change
concerns restrain their military acquisitions, basing, or operations is
farcical.

Many of our NATO **[[allies are still struggling to
meet]{.underline}]{.mark}** their [**[defense]{.underline}** **[spending
commitments]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Their militaries suffer from glaring
capability gaps. [[Siphoning scarce resources]{.underline}]{.mark} away
[[toward]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[green agenda]{.underline}]{.mark} will
only further [[**enervate** alliance]{.mark} **[collective

Yet the past few years have underscored that the future is now. [There
is no more luxury of time to respond to this challenge]{.underline}. The
[planet is sending repeated warnings that climate change has reached a
**tipping point**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [poses a **constant
threat**]{.underline} [to the functionality of economies and
societies]{.underline}. [This will make]{.underline} larger areas of the
**[globe uninhabitable]{.underline}**, as living with 50 degrees Celsius
(122 degrees Fahrenheit) or hotter becomes the norm rather than the
exception. The past three summers have been the hottest on record; the
past five years have seen the largest numbers of category 4 and 5
hurricanes. [Devastating forest fires]{.underline} have [displaced
people]{.underline} from the west coast of the United States, western
Canada, Siberia, Greece, Portugal, and Australia. Colorado recently
experienced such a fire in the middle of the winter. In January,
[meteorologists recorded]{.underline} the [most extreme
temp]{.underline}erature [vortex ever]{.underline}, with minus 50
degrees Celsius (minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Arctic and plus 50
degrees Celsius (plus 122 degrees Fahrenheit) in Australia. [We have
become used to]{.underline} **[heavier rainfalls]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} more **[widespread flooding]{.underline}**. Rising sea
levels have placed entire cities and even countries in jeopardy, as we
heard in the powerful words from Bermuda's prime minister, representing
the small island states, at 2021 United Nations Climate Change
Conference (COP26) in Glasgow last November. Indeed, [50 percent of
Asia's population]{.underline} today [lives in coastal
cities]{.underline}. The [biodiversity]{.underline} that has regulated
the smooth functioning of our natural habitat for thousands of years [is
being rapidly depleted]{.underline}. [Prolonged droughts affect
freshwater availability]{.underline} [and]{.underline} put acute
[stress]{.underline}es on [food production]{.underline} and rural
livelihoods, leading the United Nations to forecast that by mid-century,
40 percent of the globe's land surface will be subject to acute water
stress. [We will need to contend with more climate refugees than those
today on the move because of conflicts or poverty]{.underline}
(currently an all-time high of 26 million).

[Only belatedly have we become aware of]{.underline} the [role that
droughts play in]{.underline} **[exacerbating social and political
tensions]{.underline}** [in places such as Syria, Darfur]{.underline},
and [Afghanistan]{.underline}. Of course, not every natural disaster can
be laid at the door of climate change, as earthquakes in Haiti or the
recent eruption of an undersea volcano near Tonga attest. Moreover, the
planet's climate has rarely been stable, and historians have documented
extreme cold spells in the 17th century or devastating droughts in
biblical times. It was, after all, the catastrophic Lisbon earthquake in
1757 that for Voltaire ended the 18th century's age of optimism. Yet the
[mountain of scientific evidence]{.underline} [produced by]{.underline}
the UN's [I]{.underline}ntergovernmental [P]{.underline}anel on
[C]{.underline}limate [C]{.underline}hange [points to the role of global
warming as]{.underline} a **[force multiplier]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} more [frequent and extreme weather
events,]{.underline} giving the planet less time to recover from one
natural disaster before the next one strikes, thereby
[producing]{.underline} a **[cumulative destructive
effect]{.underline}**. [Climate change is]{.underline} arguably [the
**first truly global security challenge**]{.underline} in
[that]{.underline}, according to UN reports, [only 11 out
of]{.underline} the [current 193 UN member states]{.underline} [do
not]{.underline} currently [experience its impact in]{.underline} one
form or another. Any organization, like [NATO]{.underline}, that tries
to address climate change thus [faces]{.underline} the [dual challenge
of responding to individual flash points]{.underline} (such as extreme
weather events putting lives at risk or [leading]{.underline} [to social
breakdown]{.underline}), [while]{.underline} simultaneously
[understanding how climate change is shaping]{.underline} the future of
global [geopolitics]{.underline}, making fu ture conflicts over land,
water, or resources more likely in the longer term. [Getting these
predictive models right is essential]{.underline} if the
[allies]{.underline} are to devise the preventive strategies to **[head
off]{.underline}** the **[worst-case scenarios]{.underline}**
[while]{.underline} **[mitigating the worst consequences]{.underline}**.
Thus, it was no surprise that US President Joe Biden's administration
ordered a National Intelligence Estimate of the security implications of
climate change as one of its first acts upon taking office.

The [military forces of NATO countries]{.underline} have [played an
increasing role in responding to extreme weather events]{.underline} in
recent years. In fact, the first time the NATO Response Force (NRF)
deployed was to Kashmir in 2006 to help Pakistan restore infrastructure
and communications after a major earthquake. In recent years, alliance
military forces have been increasingly pulled into civil defense tasks.
[British]{.underline}, [French]{.underline}, and [Dutch]{.underline}
marines and engineers have [gone to]{.underline} the Caribbean to
[restore order in]{.underline} the [wake of hurricanes that have
paralyzed]{.underline} the normal [process of government. Military
firefighters and aircraft]{.underline} have been [mobilized to combat
forest fires i]{.underline}n the United States, Canada, and Europe.
[British and German forces]{.underline} have been called up to
[build]{.underline} [flood defenses,]{.underline} evacuate flood
victims, and build [pontoon bridges or reconnect power
lines]{.underline}. [Military hospitals]{.underline} and medical
personnel have [helped]{.underline} local authorities [cope with
extreme]{.underline} [heatwaves]{.underline} affecting the elderly and
other populations at risk. The **[military with]{.underline}** their
**[rapid-response capabilities]{.underline}** [have become the **partner
of choice**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the [civil emergency
authorities]{.underline} within NATO countries in [responding to
climate-driven events.]{.underline} This has also been the case with
other shocks that may well be linked indirectly to climate change, such
as the coronavirus pandemic, which result from stresses on the natural
environment and the interface between animals and humans. The pace of
military deployments within alliance member states has reached such an
extent that some NATO commanders are worried that this could have
deleterious consequences for training and the retention of war-fighting
skills.

In the process of deploying to climate-stressed zones, characterized by
extreme weather events or hotter or colder conditions, NATO's military
forces have become aware of how climate change impacts their own ability
to operate. For instance, the Pentagon has assessed that two-thirds of
US military bases, especially along coastlines, are vulnerable to rising
sea levels or extreme weather events. Hampton Roads in Virginia, which
is important to NATO as the home of Joint Forces Command Atlantic and
the US Second Fleet, has been assessed as especially vulnerable. Hotter
temperatures, greater frequency of high winds, storm surges, or
increased salinity in the oceans have led NATO military commanders to
review both the resilience of their equipment (for instance, the
performance of ship turbines) or the dependency of military operations
on fossil fuels. In Afghanistan, for instance, helicopters and vehicles
needed more than average maintenance because of dust storms and
persistent high temperatures, while the high consumption of gasoline
required lengthy and dangerous supply lines from Pakistan into
Afghanistan that jihadists targeted. At one stage, NATO planners
calculated that a \$2 gallon of gasoline cost over \$100 by the time it
reached a NATO ISAF unit in Helmand or Kunduz.11Amory Lovins, "DOD's
Energy Challenge as Strategic Opportunity," Joint Forces Quarterly,
Issue 57, second quarter, 2010. This certainly motivated the allies to
experiment with smart energy camps, powered by solar and wind
generators, which were demonstrated at NATO trials such as the annual
Capable Logistician exercise. The Pentagon, with an annual fuel bill
surpassing \$ 25 billion, has been graded as the 43rd "country" in the
world in terms of fossil fuel emissions.22Neta Crawford, Pentagon Fuel
Use; Climate Change and the Costs of War, Boston University paper, June
2019. Accordingly, NATO military forces have faced the twin task of
fine-tuning their modus operandi and added value in supporting the
humanitarian response to climate change, while adapting their own
doctrine, training, and capabilities to operate in these more demanding
conditions.

NATO planners calculated that a \$2 gallon of gasoline cost over \$100
by the time it reached a NATO ISAF unit in Helmand or Kunduz.

[NATO's purpose has]{.underline} always [been to defend its populations
against challenges]{.underline} [that evolve into]{.underline} concrete
[security threats]{.underline} and that require military forces or
military organizations. The criterion has been the added value that the
alliance can bring to bear. Sometimes this means that NATO is in the
lead and generates the bulk of the response from within its own ranks
and capabilities. This is obviously the case with territorial collective
defense, particularly as it applies to Russia's military buildup on
NATO's eastern borders at the present time. In other cases, the alliance
functions in a supporting role, integrating its capabilities with those
of other institutions and actors as part of a networked, comprehensive
approach. [What NATO brings to the]{.underline} [table]{.underline} here
[are its analytical and intelligence cells]{.underline}, its [strategic
planning]{.underline} and foresight capabilities, its [political
consultation]{.underline}, joint assessment and information-sharing
structures, its web [of partnerships with non-member states]{.underline}
and other international organizations, and its political-military
command and control and operations network from HQ to the regional
level. Few other organizations have all this machinery under one single
roof. [Consequently]{.underline}, [as the climate change
community]{.underline} has gradually [accepted]{.underline} a [role for
the military]{.underline} [in addressing climate
change]{.underline}---after initially fearing that this would put too
much emphasis on adaptation at the expense of the primary political goal
of reducing carbon emissions---pressure has built on [NATO]{.underline}
to [use its spectrum of capabilities in]{.underline} a [more coherent,
systematic way]{.underline}. The mounting [urgency and universality of
global warming]{.underline} **[require every institution to step
up]{.underline}** **[and play its part]{.underline}** within its means
and capabilities. The [broad spectrum of NATO assets means]{.underline}
[that it can]{.underline} [contribute in multiple supporting ways
to]{.underline} a UN-led effort both to [reduce global
warning]{.underline} [and adapt to]{.underline} the [climate
impacts]{.underline} that are [already locked in, even if that
warming]{.underline} can be **[limited to 1.5 to 2
degrees]{.underline}** Celsius over pre-industrial levels. The question
now is how to optimize all these NATO assets so that the alliance can
receive and transmit expertise and make its contribution count.

[NATO]{.underline} Secretary General and former UN climate envoy Jens
Stoltenberg has usefully led the way. At the Brussels summit in June
2021, he [declared]{.underline} that [climate is not just a
trans-boundary ecological crisis but]{.underline} a **[security
crisis]{.underline}** [as well]{.underline}. Stoltenberg skillfully used
his NATO 2030 reflection exercise and the review carried out by the
group of experts he appointed to generate public pressure and build the
case (against initial skepticism from some allies) for a formal NATO
role in addressing climate change. [Before the summit]{.underline},
[NATO foreign ministers endorsed a joint analysis of]{.underline} the
[security implications of climate change]{.underline}. One [paper
recognized climate change]{.underline} [not only as a **threat to human
security**]{.underline} per se, [but also as a]{.underline} **[force
multiplier]{.underline}** [which]{.underline} could
**[accelerate]{.underline}** and intensify **[preexisting tensions and
conflicts]{.underline}**, [many of which]{.underline}, because of their
location close to NATO's borders, [could impinge directly
on]{.underline} the [security of the alliance]{.underline}.33Neta C.
Crawford, Pentagon Fuel Use, Climate Change, and the Costs of War, Brown
University, 2019. [At the Brussels summit]{.underline}, the [allies

there are signs it has done so to some extent. On March 11, G7 leaders

referenced clean energy, the energy transition, climate change or the
Paris Agreement (see Appendix C). Although the following day the
agriculture ministers put less emphasis on climate change, two of their
15 [commitments]{.underline}, for 13%, committed to [support food

commitments]{.underline} (see Appendix D). This suggests that the

If and when the Biden team embarks on its grand European tour, it seems
virtually certain that, beyond the expressions of gratitude for
America's "return" that will surely follow them wherever they go, the
delegation can expect to be met with a lengthy list of items requiring
their immediate attention. Moreover, appeals for Washington's assistance
are likely to differ from capital to capital, with [each NATO ally
arguing]{.underline} that [their particular issue or concern
represents]{.underline} the [most pressing challenge]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} therefore [requires]{.underline} the most attention
and [resources]{.underline}. In Warsaw and the capitals of the Baltic
states, the U.S. delegation will hear that, despite a new U.S.
rotational troop deployment, a revanchist Russia necessitates additional
NATO (but especially U.S.) military commitments along the Eastern flank
of the alliance. In Rome, Athens, and Madrid, U.S. policymakers will
learn that the Mediterranean countries represent the "soft underbelly"
of NATO and that the alliance must do more to project stability along
its southern arc of instability. In Ankara, the message will be one of
anger directed at what the Erdogan government perceives as NATO's
collective failure to support Turkish actions in Syria and elsewhere. In
Paris, the message for the U.S. delegation will be that the alliance
must strengthen its counter-terrorism efforts in the Middle East and
North Africa, while in Berlin the focus will be on reforming NATO's
nuclear posture and salvaging expiring arms-control agreements.
Meanwhile, securing the Arctic and halting the effects of climate change
will be at the top of the agenda in Copenhagen and Oslo.

In short, [wherever]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} presidential
delegation [goes]{.underline}, [it will be met with
requests]{.underline} that Washington --- and with it, [the [NATO
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [**[prioritize]{.underline}**
**[everything]{.underline}**]{.mark}, thereby [fulfilling]{.underline}
the old [adage that]{.underline}, "**[[When everything is]{.mark} a
[priority]{.mark}, [nothing is]{.mark} a priority]{.underline}**." Given
the precarious state of international relations today, the temptation to
do more is understandably strong. It is easy to understand why, in the
present climate of global instability, calls for the transatlantic
alliance to reinforce and strengthen its existing commitments while
simultaneously adding new mandates, missions, and programs are popular.
[[Rather than]{.underline} [adding more]{.underline}]{.mark} [items
[to]{.mark} its]{.underline} **[already [crowded
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, the [time has come
for]{.underline} not just the United States but also [[NATO]{.mark} to
[consider]{.mark} **[doing less but]{.mark}**]{.underline} doing it
**[[better]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

When More Is Less, and Less Is More

For an alliance that has long prided itself on its commonality of
purpose and interests, the truth is that NATO is in danger of losing
both. [On paper]{.underline} and in public, the [members]{.underline}
still [agree]{.underline} the [core purpose of]{.underline} the
71-year-old [alliance is deterrence and defense]{.underline} of the
North Atlantic region. When internal disagreements are aired publicly,
other allies are quick to dispel reports of rifts by pointing out that
differences of opinion are nothing new. [But]{.underline}
[unlike]{.underline} during the [Cold War]{.underline}, when a single
adversary occupied all of the alliance's attention, [[today's security
environment]{.underline}]{.mark} --- as the allies routinely remind each
other --- [[is multifaceted]{.underline}]{.mark} and complex. In an
effort to address members' often disparate security requirements,
[NATO]{.underline} has [taken on additional tasks over]{.underline} the
[[past three decades]{.underline}]{.mark} almost as quickly as it has
taken on additional members. The [[NATO-ization of every security
challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} has meant that issues once considered the
purview of individual nations or other international organizations ---
such as [migration]{.underline}, [terrorism]{.underline}, and [foreign
security]{.underline} force assistance --- are now [lumped onto NATO's
agenda]{.underline} [under]{.underline} the [guise of fulfilling its
ambitious]{.underline} (and potentially limitless) post-Cold War
[mandate of "projecting stability]{.underline}."

For far too long now, alliance leaders have tasked the NATO military
infrastructure with a seemingly impossible undertaking: weighing down
the military organization with new responsibilities like peacekeeping
and counter-terrorism while simultaneously allowing members to shirk on
contributing the resources required to fulfill old and new alliance
missions. To date, much of the criticism surrounding NATO's current
strategic deadlock has focused on the resource issue and the strains
caused by uneven burden-sharing within the alliance. Far less attention
has been paid to the first part of the "ends-means-ways" formulation of
strategy, namely NATO's original purpose. While addressing "means" and
"ways" are crucial elements in any strategic enterprise, it is past time
the Allies got around to focusing on NATO's strategic ends once more.

Confronting NATO's present strategic dilemma will require looking beyond
existing strategic documents like the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty, which
proclaimed the signatories' commitment to the "preservation of peace and
security" in the North Atlantic area. As the past three decades of NATO
transformation have shown, there is not much that does not fit under the
rubric of fostering "peace and security" and consequently cannot be
tacked onto the alliance's agenda. True strategy requires setting (and
adhering to) actual goals and priorities, as well as developing plans to
achieve them. Although the alliance's past strategic documents have
often sought to define NATO's evolving strategic purpose with more
precision than the founding treaty, the alliance has not adopted a new
strategic concept since 2010 for fear that embarking on such an exercise
would only further inflame the deep rifts within the alliance that such
strategic endeavors are meant to help address.

Officially, [NATO members]{.underline} still [assert
collective]{.underline} [defense]{.underline} is the alliance's primary
task, despite the inclusion of two other core tasks --- [projecting
stability and cooperative securit]{.underline}y/crisis management --- in
all three of its post-Cold War Strategic Concepts (1991, 1999, 2010).
The [addition of these latter two core tasks]{.underline} --- coupled
with members' differing threat perceptions about what rises to the level
of an existential security threat --- [has]{.underline}
**[[clouded]{.mark} the [organization's
focus]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} [[After]{.underline} **[three
decades]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [continual
[adaptation]{.mark},]{.underline} the [[danger that]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[alliance's origin]{.mark}al]{.underline} [raison d'étre of
collective [defense]{.mark}]{.underline} [[gets]{.underline}]{.mark}
further [[downgraded]{.mark} to]{.underline} the point where it risks
[becoming]{.underline} [primus inter pares [among]{.mark} NATO's many
[other responsibilities is real]{.mark}]{.underline}. As with previous
critical junctures in transatlantic relations, it will take American
leadership to change NATO's future course. Come January 2021, a Biden
administration should move swiftly to announce its intention to
commission a new NATO strategic concept by 2022. Should Trump win, all
bets are off.

Defenders of NATO's post-Cold War emphasis on projecting stability and
collective security argue that NATO has a proven track record of crisis
management and capacity-building beyond its borders in places like
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The alliance's
cooperative security track record, however, is hardly stellar. This past
June, the NATO-led international peacekeeping force in Kosovo entered
its 22nd year of operation. Almost 17 years after the alliance's
Integrated Military Command first assumed responsibilities in
Afghanistan, the NATO flag continues to fly in Kabul, where some 15,000
allied troops remain as part of NATO's Resolute Support mission. Nor can
the alliance's intervention in Libya in 2011 be considered a resounding
success, judging by the state of affairs there today. That NATO remains
engaged in some of these places decades afterward is not an impeachment
of the men and women who served in these operations and performed the
tasks demanded of them. It is, howevwer, evidence of NATO's failure to
give sufficient consideration to its core strategic purpose.

While one can debate the wisdom of NATO having accumulated such an
expansionist security agenda in an era marked by American unipolarity,
an all-encompassing approach to security is harder to justify in a time
of waning American power. Just as the diminishing threat of great-power
competition in the 1990s and early 2000s freed NATO to take on
additional security tasks beyond its traditional mission of collective
defense, its return should prompt a reexamination to determine whether
NATO is still the appropriate entity for handling such tasks.

Another center of excellence, special representative, or office will not
fix what ails NATO. As the authors of a recent Heritage Foundation
report on "NATO in the 21st Century" put it, it is time for NATO to get
"back to the basics." There are limits to what an international
institution --- even one as successful as NATO --- can accomplish: "When
policymakers expect or want NATO to do what it was never designed to do,
that is when the Alliance risks failure."

The launch of NATO Secretary Gen. Jens Stoltenberg's #NATO2030
reflection process earlier this year to address political reforms within
the alliance presented just such an opportunity to tackle these and
other big-picture questions. It is still unclear to what extent the
pandemic has delayed the work of the group of experts begun last March.
The Biden team will have to move quickly if it hopes to help shape the
working group's deliberations, as Stoltenberg is slated to brief members
on the path forward for the alliance at the April 2021 Leaders' Summit.

Back to the Future: Narrowing (Not Broadening) NATO's Remit

Looking ahead, alliance leaders should consider ways to streamline
current NATO missions and tasks so that responsibilities that fall below
the threshold of existential challenges can be unloaded onto other
multilateral institutions or global partnerships. In addition to
bringing an end to the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, alliance
leaders should consider getting NATO out of the security assistance and
stabilization business altogether. Calls for NATO to look for
opportunities to do more in the MENA region should also be rebuffed. Few
would dispute that this region poses real security challenges to
European states or that these challenges are particularly acute for the
southernmost members of the alliance, some of whom might even view
migration and refugee flows as rising to the level of existential
threats. But while the 21st century challenges to the "stability and
well-being" of member states may be numerous and growing, there is only
one NATO. A single organization cannot tackle every national security
challenge its members face. To remain useful, the alliance must choose
which threats to prioritize.

Doing so requires recognizing that not every security issue rises to the
level of an existential threat to the alliance. Terrorist attacks were a
common occurrence in many West European nations in the 1970s and 1980s,
yet NATO did not fundamentally transform its agenda back then because
members recognized that the threat posed by the Soviet Union was
greater. While neither Russia nor China as yet represents a threat on
par with the Soviet Union, NATO should prepare for the possibility that
the latter (either alone or in combination with Moscow) could pose an
existential challenge to the Atlantic community in the coming decades.

Nor is it evident that NATO was ever the appropriate venue for tackling
threats like terrorism in the first place. Effective counter-terrorism
requires intelligence-sharing; local policing and counter-radicalization
programs; and financial instruments that agencies like Europol,
Interpol, the Global Counterterrorism Forum, and others are better
equipped to lead than an overstretched military alliance. The same is
true when it comes to other activities the transatlantic alliance has
added to its roster since 1991, like stabilization missions and security
sector reform. In fact, organizations such as the United Nations, the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the European
Union provide more appropriate venues for tackling many of the
collective security duties the alliance has assumed since the 1990s. As
a regional defensive military alliance, NATO's comparative advantage
lies in providing territorial defense against other states or groups of
states. This is a comparative advantage that should be preserved, not
diluted by the addition of other security tasks. True comparative
advantage arises from specialization. [[Continuing to add more]{.mark}

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} [[finds itself in]{.mark} a
[complicated]{.mark}]{.underline} and crowded [[institutional
environment]{.underline} [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [context of
climate security]{.mark} risk]{.underline}. A variety of international
organizations---as well as NGO and member state agencies---share
responsibility for the potentially adverse and wide ranging impact of a
changing climate. Yet, [[NATO]{.underline} [has]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark} [and relationships
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [allow it to play a role in
[shap]{.mark}ing]{.underline}, guiding, and implementing [actions on the
[climate-security]{.mark} nexus.]{.underline}

The landscape of institutions with responsibility or interest in climate
change and security is comprised of a mosaic of organizations. It
should, therefore, come as no surprise that these 82 organizations have
so far been unable to find a coordinated response. NATO will also
struggle to articulate a formal position on climate change and security
because of its consensus-based decision-making process. Still, a risk
governance analysis can facilitate a discussion because it harnesses a
broad array of risk considerations that could promote insights on
whether [NATO]{.underline} has adequately addressed the climate security
risk it faces.

The problem of [climate security risk [requires]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[difficult tradeoffs]{.underline}** [of

to individual analytic conclusions, information on climate security risk
is nevertheless insufficient to render a complete understanding of the
scope and implications because the location and magnitude of risks to be
mitigated are deeply uncertain, global in nature, and highly complex
(discussed in Chapter 2).

[[Climate Change as]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[[Non-Traditional Threat
Multiplier]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Since its formation, the earth's climate has been changing. The planet
has witnessed multiple periods of [climate change]{.underline} that
[lasted]{.underline} for [**thousands of years**, during which the
earth's climate has been warming. The [current]{.mark}]{.underline}
global [[warming]{.mark} [phenomenon]{.mark} is]{.underline} mostly
[[caused by]{.underline} **[increasing]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[concentrations of [GHGs]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
other [**[anthropogenic activities]{.mark}**. Based on]{.underline} the
[measurements in]{.underline} [**ice core samples**, scientists have
come to the conclusion that present-day GHGs levels are the]{.underline}
**[[highest]{.mark} they have been]{.underline}** [[since]{.underline}
**[800,000]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[years ago]{.underline}**.

In the early nineteenth century, the concentration of CO2 in the
atmosphere was 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv). By the 1960s,
emissions rose to 316 ppmv. Today they are around 420 ppmv.\[26\] The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) temperature threshold
defined a "tolerable" increase in global average temperatures as an
increase of only 2 degrees Celsius (°C). [If]{.underline} the
[current]{.underline} emissions [trajectories hold]{.underline},
however, [humanity is heading towards]{.underline} a
**[5°C]{.underline}** [increase in average global temperature by the end
of the twenty-first century]{.underline}.\[27\] Even though a 5°C
increase sounds like an insignificant number, when observed [on
a]{.underline} **[planetary scale]{.underline}**, it certainly
represents [a]{.underline} **[tremendous fluctuation]{.underline}**. The
temperature difference between today's temperature and the average
global temperature during the last Ice Age was -5°C. During that period,
significant parts of North America, Northern Europe, the Atlantic, and
the Pacific oceans were covered with huge ice sheets.

[Climate change]{.underline} is not principally an environmental
concern, however. It is actually a problem that [is]{.underline} closely
[**[linked]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} national
**[[econ]{.mark}omic [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[strategic
planning]{.underline}**, **[public [health]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
**[[infra]{.mark}structure]{.underline}**,
**[[finance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and]{.underline} international
**[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\[28\] The impacts of [climate
change]{.underline} [are]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}**
dramatically [affecting]{.underline} **[food]{.underline}** security,
**[weather]{.underline}** patterns, **[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark}**
relations, [access to]{.underline} [**[fresh water]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[mass [migration]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Scientists have]{.underline} already [provided mountains
of]{.underline} convincing **[ev]{.underline}**idence [that]{.underline}
global [warming is]{.underline} **[distressing]{.underline}** the
**[life-support systems]{.underline}** [on which]{.underline} **[human
beings]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[other species
depend]{.underline}**.\[29\] More importantly, [these impacts are
occurring much]{.underline} **[more quickly]{.underline}** [than some
security experts and scientists had predicted]{.underline}. [Sea levels
are rising, snow and ice cover are decreasing, and both rainfall
patterns and growing seasons are changing]{.underline}.

[The biggest problem is that these [changes]{.mark} are [happening
in]{.mark} a very **[short geological time scale]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The earth's climate has certainly changed over time, but [in
the]{.underline} **[past]{.underline}** these alterations---barring
extraordinary events like meteor impacts---developed slowly and lasted
for thousands of years. This [slow]{.underline} **[pace]{.underline}**
of climate change [gave flora and fauna]{.underline} enough
**[time]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[adapt]{.underline}** and
evolve. Scientists Ignacio Quintero and John J. Wiens discovered that
species evolve at steady rates at around 1°C per million years.\[30\]
Researchers from the IPCC stated that temperatures are going to rise
between 2°C and 4°C in the next hundred years.\[31\] When calculated,
the results lead us to the grim finding "that
[**[matching]{.underline}** [projected changes]{.underline}]{.mark} [for
2100 would require rates of niche evolution that are **[10,000 times
faster]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[than]{.mark} rates]{.underline}
**[typically [observed]{.mark}]{.underline}** among species."\[32\]

A recent study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) shows that the most economically vulnerable regions
are Africa and Asia. Based on data compiled since the 1990s, the OECD
projects that gross domestic product (GDP) losses in 2060 will amount to
3.3 percent for the Middle-East and Northern Africa; 3.7 percent for
South-and South-East Asia; and 3.8 percent for Sub-Saharan
Africa.\[33\]Furthermore, GDP surges in Latin America, -1.5 percent by
2060, and Eurasia, which includes Europe, China, and Russia, in 2.1
percent GDP loss by 2060. In total, societies across the globe are
facing a global average 2 percent of GDP loss.\[34\]

[[Climate]{.mark} [change]{.mark} will]{.underline} negatively
[[affect]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[food]{.mark}
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}** in tropical and temperate climates.
Crops are adversely affected by drought and other extreme weather
events. In the last hundred years the world significantly increased its
food production and experienced dynamic growth in population. "[Exposed
and/or [vulnerable regions]{.mark} will suffer]{.underline} from [risks
to]{.underline} **[all aspects]{.underline}** [of food security,
including]{.underline} food **[access]{.underline}**,
**[utilization]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} price
**[stability]{.underline}**, [and could even
[experience]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[full
breakdowns]{.underline}**]{.mark} of food systems."\[35\] In the summer
of 2013, for instance, Russia was hit by an extremely destructive
drought. A state of emergency was declared in twenty regions across the
country. In the end, a ten percent drop in Russian production caused a
forty percent increase in global wheat markets.\[36\] Since the early
2000s, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad enforced an agricultural
strategy with a goal of attaining self-sufficiency in national food
production. During the effort to increase agricultural output, the
country overused its water reserves. To make matters worse, Syria was
home to one million Iraqi refugees, which contributed to additional
social stress. From 2006 to 2010, large parts of the country were hit by
consecutive droughts. When drought hit again in 2011, desperate farmers
went to the cities and started protesting; when mixed with a complex
ethnic composition and social structure in crisis, the drought certainly
contributed to increasing tensions.\[37\] It is hard to claim that
drought sparked the Syrian Civil War; however we can state that
socio-economic despair triggered by successive droughts between
2006-2011 accelerated social unrest in that nation.\[38\]

[Climate]{.underline} change [will create]{.underline} public **[health
issues]{.underline}** [through increases in **heat-stress mortality**,
tropical]{.underline} [**vector-borne diseases**, urban]{.underline}
**[air pollution problems]{.underline}**, and decreases in cold-related
illnesses. "Areas where malaria is currently endemic could experience
intensified transmission (on the order of fifty to eighty million
additional annual cases, relative to an estimated global background
total of five hundred million cases)."\[39\] Natural disasters between
1990 and 1999 killed 600,000 people.\[40\] Extreme and unpredicted
fluctuations in temperatures cause heat stress (hyperthermia) or extreme
cold (hypothermia) that often end in heart and respiratory failure. In
the summer of 2003, high temperatures caused an estimated 70,000 more
deaths as compared to the average death rate in previous years.\[41\]
Warmer temperatures increase levels of evaporation and disturb rainfall
patterns. This increases the risk of diarrhea, a disease that on average
takes around two million lives annually. Diarrhea also increases the
spread of trachoma, an eye infection that can lead to blindness.\[42\]

[[Environmental disasters]{.underline}]{.mark} are able to [severely
[hurt]{.mark}]{.underline} **[modern [economies]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
When hurricane Sandy ravaged the east cost of the U.S. and parts of the
Caribbean, an estimated 1.8 million structures and homes were destroyed
or damaged. Economic losses surpassed US\$ 65 billion. Tourism was the
hardest hit industry, with 10,000 job cuts and losses of US\$ 1
billion.\[43\] In the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, US\$ 40 billion in
claims were filed and the city of New Orleans' population decreased by
18 percent when compared to pre-storm levels.\[44\] In one of their
reports that surveyed more than 1,500 leading global private companies,
the Carbon Disclosure Project stated that climate change is the main
threat to business security. The report also stated that more than one
third of companies experienced disruption in production from rainfall or
drought which caused a 31 percent increase in production costs.\[45\]

Pre-existing [**[poverty]{.underline}**
**[multiplies]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the chances of
failure]{.underline} when a state or region is faced with a massive
flood or long drought. The majority of low-income countries are situated
in tropical zones closer to the equator. On average they are hotter,
which has traditionally limited their agricultural outputs, and as
temperatures increase, the amount of agricultural output decreases
further. For example, negative climate impacts are predicted to generate
a welfare loss equivalent to a quarter of total income in sub-Saharan
Africa and certain parts of Asia.\[46\] In 2011, Thailand was hit by
unusually destructive floods. In total, sixty-five out of country's
seventy-seven provinces were affected. They lasted from July 2011 until
January 2012, affecting the everyday lives of 13 million people. Total
losses were US\$ 45 billion, which classifies this event as one of the
top five natural disasters in recorded history.\[47\]

[Climate change can be classified as a]{.underline} **[threat
[multiplier]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[for]{.mark} countries
suffering]{.underline} from [**[political instability]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[ethnic tensions]{.underline}**]{.mark}[.
Socio-economic differences]{.underline} in the northern part of Nigeria,
particularly in the Sahel region, [are]{.underline}
**[stark]{.underline}**. In the last decade, more than hundred villages
have been abandoned due to desertification. Migration and unrelated
population growth have **[added]{.underline}** supplementary stress
[to]{.underline} already unstable relations between ethnic groups in the
Muslim north and Christian south. In 2010, this led to land disputes and
uprisings that were fueled by religious differences in which
approximately a thousand people lost their lives.\[48\] Moreover,
amplified desertification of the Nigerian Sahel left many people in
despair, strengthening the influence of terrorist organizations, such as
Boko Haram, an **[al-Qaeda]{.underline}** affiliate. Boko Haram used the
power vacuum [and]{.underline} inefficiency of the central national
government to position itself as an ambassador, representing the
grievances of northern Nigerians. **[Boko Haram]{.underline}**'s actions
infringed upon the Nigerian government's ability to provide security.

NATO and Climate Change

NATO first defined and recognized environmental challenges as potential
threat to security in 1969. The first organizational mechanism focusing
on environmental challenges was the Committee on the Challenges of
Modern Society (CCMS). CCMS utilized knowledge gained through networks
of national experts working on scientific publications examining
defense-related environmental issues. Teams of experts funded by member
states tackled problems affecting ecosystems and quality of life through
three to five year pilot studies, shorter term projects, conferences,
workshops, and roundtables.\[49\]

In 2006, CCMS merged with NATO's Science for Peace and Security (SPS)
Program. SPS is a policy tool and platform for dialogue based on
scientific research, innovation, and knowledge exchange. It provides
funding, expert advice, and support to NATO-led operations and
activities developed with partner states. NATO defines the environmental
sphere within two concepts: security and protection. First,
environmental security reflects responses to security challenges
originating from the physical and natural environment. Second,
environmental protection is defined as safeguarding physical and natural
environment from the detrimental impact of military activities.

Since the formation of the CCMS, NATO has tried to respect environmental
principles and policies under all authorized conditions. For that
reason, the Alliance formed two different bodies, the Environmental
Protection Working Group (EPWG) and the Specialist Team on Energy
Efficiency and Environmental Protection (STEEEP). The EPWG drafts NATO
policies that diminish possible harmful impacts of military activities
on the environment. The STEEEP integrates environmental protection and
energy efficiency regulations into technical requirements and
specifications for military hardware, equipment, and machinery.

However, the notion of climate change as a security threat remains
underdeveloped, especially when compared to traditional security risks
such as traditional war, weapons of mass destruction, and terrorism. The
non-traditional threat of climate change was first institutionalized in
NATO's agenda in the 2010 Strategic Concept for the Defense and Security
of the Members of NATO. Point fifteen in the Security Environment
section mentions the climate change in the following context,

[Key]{.underline} environmental and resource [constraints,
including]{.underline} **[health]{.underline}** risks,
**[climate]{.underline}** change, **[water scarcity]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} increasing **[energy needs]{.underline}**
[will]{.underline} further **[shape the future security
environment]{.underline}** [in areas of concern to]{.underline}
**[NATO]{.underline}** [and have the potential to]{.underline}
significantly **[affect NATO planning and
operations]{.underline}**.\[50\]

Former Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer highlighted climate change as
a non-traditional threat in 2008. His successor, Secretary General Fogh
Rasmussen, integrated climate concerns into NATO's functioning
mechanism. In 2009, General Secretary Rasmussen stated, "NATO should
begin a discussion on how we---NATO as an organization, and individual
Allies as well---can do better to address the security aspects of
climate change."\[51\]

It is clear that climate change has been on the Alliance's priority list
for years prior to the 2010 Strategic Concept, but until the beginning
of this decade it was not integrated into the NATO's agenda. The
Emerging Security Challenges Division (ESCD) was established the same
year as the Strategic Concept. The ESCD was established to respond to a
growing range of non-traditional risks and challenges, with climate
change being one of them. The division's goal is to monitor and
anticipate threats arising from non-traditional risks and catapult
non-traditional security challenges to the center of NATO's radar.

In 2013, NATO adopted the Green Defense framework, which "seeks to
increase the Organization's operational effectiveness through changes in
the use of energy, while saving resources and enhancing environmental
sustainability."\[52\] The framework highlights NATO's readiness to
explore the smart energy domain. Additionally, work within the framework
gave birth to the Smart Energy Team (SET), a working group that advises
NATO on its efforts to help lower fuel and electricity consumption and
identify practical energy-efficient solutions to the Alliance's military
forces. The SET should lead to cuts in CO2 emissions by the world's
biggest armed force.

In January 2014, Jens Stoltenberg became the United Nations Special
Envoy on Climate Change. The 2014 Wales Summit Declaration stated that
climate change and increasing energy needs will shape the global
security arena in the future. The Wales Declaration underlined that
climate change-induced security concerns such as environmental and
resource constraints, including health risks and water scarcity, will
result in crises that will directly affect NATO. The declaration
reinforced the Alliance's stance on the issue that climate change
represents a new and growing threat to all NATO member states.

Shortly after the Wales Declaration, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly
adopted Resolution 427 on Climate Change and International
Security.\[53\] The document acknowledges that climate change-related
risks are significant threat multipliers, recognizes the need to work on
climate action with efforts to strengthen the resilience of states, and
praises the formation of the Green Defense Framework and the SET. NATO
showed readiness and willingness to invest in collective defense and to
work to develop capabilities to respond to climate change challenges.
During his visit to Croatia in July 2015, General Secretary Stoltenberg
emphasized:

[Environment, [climate change is **critical**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for
promoting]{.underline}]{.mark} **[development]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [**[peace]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[stability]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Development is important both for
development and for security. And **[security]{.underline}** [is
important to provide the **foundations**]{.underline} [for development
and for addressing climate change.\[]{.underline}54\]

At the moment, NATO is undergoing an evolutionary process in integrating
the threat of climate change into the organization's modus operandi.
While the notion of climate change has been recognized, acknowledged,
and analyzed, it has not yet been fully integrated into the Alliance's
operations. To date, climate change has been a strategic security threat
that has for the most part been more actively pursued on the national
level.

Consider the fact that the [melting]{.underline} of the
**[ice]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} **[far north]{.underline}**
[is making the Arctic more and more]{.underline} [**accessible**. As
the]{.underline} Arctic [ice continues to **retreat**, trade routes will
**remain open**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} **[longer]{.underline}**
periods of time, increasing annual traffic of ships carrying goods and
resources in the North. At present, no one owns the Arctic, but Canada,
Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States have all laid different
claims to territories on the Artic. In 2007, Russia sent a diving team
to position its flag on the sea floor underneath the ice cap. NATO
member state Norway is already adopting a Smart Defense Strategy that
centers around a strong focus on the Arctic, both with regards to
funding and resource allocation. In 2009, the Norwegian Defense Force
made a decision "to relocate the Army's Headquarters functions to the
Arctic town of Bodø---1,700 kilometers north of Oslo---\[bolstering\]
Norway's commitment to establishing an integrated High North defense
system."\[55\]

Canada is another NATO member state that cares greatly about the Arctic
sovereignty issue. Canada deployed Canadian Ranger units to help the
indigenous population of the Canadian Arctic to ensure that northern
communities are equipped with all necessary goods so that they may reap
the benefits of economic activities. Maintaining functional population
centers in the Arctic helps Canada protect its national sovereignty in
the far North.

The United Kingdom (UK) has incorporated climate change in its national
defense planning, introducing climate change study programs in its
military staff colleges. In 2009, the British Ministry of Defence
published guidance entitled "Defence in Changing Climate," a document
that outlines principal objectives and identifies concrete targets for
GHGs reduction in the sphere of the UK's military concerns.\[56\] The
Ministry's climate change strategy became effective in March 2012. Soon
after the adoption of the strategy, the Ministry created the position of
Climate and Energy Security Envoy to act as a focal point for
representing this institution in the climate change and security
realm.\[57\]

Spain formed a Military Emergencies Unit to respond to climate
disasters. By 2012, this military unit had responded to ninety climate
change-ignited disasters, most of them on domestic territory.\[58\]
Defense strategy documents in Denmark, the Czech Republic, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland all mention climate security, but do
not yet have concrete mechanisms, units, and departments that respond to
these security threats. The French military developed several climate
and security projects, but has admitted that its leadership is just
starting to acknowledge more seriously the importance of climate change
in the national security nexus. In 2011, close to 4.5 percent of the
French defense budget was allocated to financing environment and future
defense policy. The Dutch government has invested millions of Euros in
strengthening costal flood defense mechanisms, and Denmark has allocated
2.2 percent of its defense budget to improve the climate change disaster
response capacity of the Home Guard Command.\[59\]

The issue of climate change encompasses a broad spectrum of human
security, which may or may not include national security. So far, the
U.S. has made the most progress in addressing this issue, as compared to
the other twenty-eight NATO members.

Under the 2007 Global Climate Change Security Oversight Act, the United
States initiated a far more systematic program of research on global
climate change impacts on military requirements, operations, doctrine,
organization, training, material, logistics, personnel, and facilities
and on the actions needed to address such impacts.\[60\]

The 2008 U.S. National Defense Authorization Act directed the U.S.
Department of Defense to evaluate the capability of armed forces to
respond to natural disaster (e.g. floods, wildfires, droughts, etc.) and
other missions the armed forces may be asked to conduct domestically or
in foreign countries.\[61\]

The Pentagon's 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap is a concise
document that outlines the effects of extreme weather events and rising
temperatures on military training, operations, acquisitions, and
infrastructure. The document is designed to become the basis for
long-term planning for security risks that arise from the increase in
global temperatures. This report is significant because it utilizes
strong language implying that climate change is not only a future, but
rather a present security threat multiplier. In response to this
document, the U.S. Department of Defense has: (i) collected historic
data and potential future vulnerabilities from coastal locations and
developed regional sea-level rise scenarios for 704 coastal locations;
(ii) evaluated military installations' vulnerability to global warming
impacts and directed military planners to incorporate climate change
considerations into certain installation planning efforts; and (iii)
demanded that the hazardous impacts of climate change be included in
installation master planning as we all as natural resource exploitation
planning.\[62\]

The U.S. armed forces have been actively engaged in studying climate
change as a security threat since the end of the Cold War. The U.S.
Naval War College was the first institution that pointed out the
potential impact of climate change on future policymaking. The U.S.
intelligence community, as well, has been monitoring risks emerging from
climate change within the MEDEA program---a collaborative initiative
among climate scientists and U.S. intelligence agencies---and has been
issuing intelligence reports based on analysis of climate change-related
security impacts since 2008.\[63\]

Although the national defense agendas of some member states are ahead of
NATO in responding to climate change impacts, NATO has been engaged in
helping Partnership for Peace Program countries to mitigate natural
disasters caused by or exacerbated by global warming. In May 2014, a
low-pressure cyclone in Bosnia and Herzegovina caused the biggest floods
and landslides in recorded history, with flood damages costing close to
US\$ 2.2 billion.\[64\] Although fewer than a hundred people died, a
significant percentage of critical infrastructure---such as schools,
hospitals, roads, and railroads---were destroyed or heavily damaged. In
addition, the disaster created 2,100 active landslides across the
mountainous Bosnian terrain and dislocated many of the 9,000 marked
minefields. Twenty-one NATO members provided humanitarian aid,
helicopters, rescue teams, medicines, blankets, and tents across Bosnia
and Herzegovina. Upon the request of the Bosnian government, NATO
activated the Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre
(EADRCC), which conducted operations in flooded Bosnian territory.
Eighteen NATO member states sent boats, water pumps, power generators,
humanitarian aid, and helicopters. Without the engagement of NATO's
EADRCC and NATO troops on the ground, Bosnia and Herzegovina would have
faced serious if not impossible obstacles in its recovery efforts.

[Climate change]{.underline} [has]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}**
[become a]{.underline} **[dangerous reality]{.underline}** in the five
Central Asian republics. Environmental mismanagement and limited
climate-related disaster adaptation, combined with a naturally arid
climate that has been profoundly affected by the global rise in
temperatures, transformed the region into one that is now increasingly
vulnerable to the effects of temperature fluctuations and water
shortages. Over the last fifteen years, the rise in temperature melted
one-third of all the region's glaciers.\[65\]

[Melting **glaciers**]{.underline} [disrupt]{.underline} **[regional
water flaws]{.underline}**. The largest rivers in the region originate
in the mountainous republics of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan; both
republics are home to some of the Soviet era's largest dams. At the same
time that these glaciers are retreating, fresh water levels are
additionally impacted by hydroelectric dams. Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan,
and Kazakhstan are feeling the consequences of reduced downstream river
flows. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are trying to fight their water
shortages by retaining a larger amount of water in the dam reservoirs,
but as shortages are becoming more severe, there is less water left for
the agricultural economies of downstream countries. From 2004 to 2009,
NATO worked to support integrated water resources management for a
wetlands restoration project in the Aral Sea basin.\[66\] Additionally,
NATO was engaged in a project using a comprehensive multidisciplinary
approach to assess the geo-environmental security of the Toktogul
hydroelectric power station, which is the largest of its kind in Central
Asia.

It is clear that [**[threats]{.underline}**
[emanating]{.underline}]{.mark} [from global warming will]{.underline}
**[exceed national and regional scopes.]{.underline}** [Climate change
is]{.underline} a threat [[operating on a]{.underline} **[planetary
scale]{.underline}**]{.mark}, simultaneously activating multiple
security challenges. Climate impacts [will]{.underline} directly
[[affect]{.underline} [**military facilities**,
**personnel**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and]{.underline}
[**[hardware]{.mark}**. NATO]{.underline} **[cannot ignore the
perils]{.underline}** of climate change. Conversely, the Alliance will
become more actively engaged in dealing with it. Since the publishing of
the Strategic Concept in 2010 NATO started addressing this problem.
Nevertheless, the Alliance can improve and catch up in
institutionalizing the notion of climate change at the heart of
organization by harmonizing its policy with the efforts already done by
American, British, Canadian, Norwegian, or any other member state
governments that could offer good solutions. In 2009, the former General
Secretary Fogh Rasmussen laid out a robust list of objectives for NATO
which are still relevant when applied to current context.

Future prospects for NATO's involvement in the realm of climate change
security could be paralyzed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Since the
beginning of his presidential campaign as well as his presidency, Donald
Trump has demonstrated skepticism towards climate change
phenomenon.\[67\] Moreover, key members of Trump's administration are
climate change deniers (i.e. head of U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency Scott Pruitt), fossil fuel industry lobbyists (i.e. U.S.
Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke), and former fossil fuel industry
executives (i.e. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson). The new
American administration has already started abolishing domestic
initiatives to protect the climate and environment and seems likely to
ignore climate change security as a component of wider NATO policy and
operations. It is still early to predict changes in the U.S. official
climate strategy within the Alliance; however, the U.S. withdrawal from
the Paris Climate Agreement in June 2017 might have a negative impact on
the Alliance's ability to integrate further climate change mitigation
and adaptation measures as a security component of NATO's policy and
operations.

Conclusion

[Climate change]{.underline} is a non-traditional threat that
[has]{.underline} profound [ramifications on a]{.underline} [**planetary
scale**. It [simultaneously]{.mark}]{.underline} [[affects]{.underline}
**[every person]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[rich and poor]{.underline}**,
[as well as]{.underline} **[every state]{.underline}**, **[big or
small]{.underline}**, **[developed or developing]{.underline}**,
**[young or old]{.underline}**. [Climate change is a]{.underline}
**[threat multiplier]{.underline}** [that will]{.underline} **[shape the
security environment]{.underline}** in the twenty first century.

Although NATO is already engaged in developing policy and conducting
operations responding to climate change impacts, it is easy to
understand why climate change considerations are not yet fully
integrated into the Alliance's modus operandi. After all, NATO was
conceived in the Cold War and---at least until the September 11
attacks---its main purpose has always been to react to traditional
threats. Climate change is just one of many threats to which NATO must
respond. Realism offers good solutions to analyses of war, conflict,
geopolitics, alliances, and balancing behaviors, but it lacks effective
solutions when it comes to confronting environmental security threats
originating from climate change.

Climate change is a novel non-traditional type of threat with multiplier
effects that must be effectively addressed. Hence, as the discussion
above demonstrated, the Alliance should address climate change through
utilization of a non-traditional approach to security. Beck's risk
society theory defines solid strategies to deal with climate change as a
non-traditional threat multiplier. Risk society provides a theoretical
framework for a systematic approach to dealing with hazards and
insecurities induced and introduced by the process of modernization, of
which climate change is a perfect example.

NATO will need to implement a stronger and more coherent approach to
dealing with climate change. More precisely, the Alliance needs to
develop more concrete policies as well as the capacities of partner
nation forces to manage environmental security crises. This can include
a faster process of sharing climate change-related knowledge between
member states and the Alliance. This encompasses learning from
capacities that exist on the member state level and upgrading them to
work on the Alliance level. [[NATO militaries need to]{.underline}
**[integrate]{.underline}**]{.mark} issues related to [**[climate
risk]{.underline}** [into]{.underline} ]{.mark}[their
**[training]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[exercise
routines]{.underline}**. Moreover, member states need to work on
developing a common Alliance strategy for responding to the negative
impacts of climate change on military planning and operations. Because
there is currently a disparity about how this issue is addressed, all
member states must be encouraged to integrate the mitigation of climate
risks into their national defense strategies. The United States is
currently led by a government that will most probably not focus on the
issue, while its European allies such as France, Germany, and the UK
already consider the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change to
be one of their most crucial national security priorities. This
difference in views has the potential to cause a certain level of
disparity in strategic planning of the alliance. Nevertheless, the
current U.S. administration's dismissal of this security concern could
potentially complicate stronger engagement of the Alliance in the field
of climate change security.

At present, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} exists in a world where it is
facing both traditional and non-traditional threats. It
[has]{.underline} **[proven itself]{.underline}** [as an organization
that [can]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[master]{.underline}**]{.mark}
traditional **[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but the Alliance must
upgrade and accelerate current efforts to develop a more efficient and
concrete strategy to respond to the non-traditional threat multiplier of
climate change as a security risk. [This will
[require]{.mark}]{.underline} leaders to encourage efforts for
[[deeper]{.underline} **[integration]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[of]{.underline} climate change **[threat analysis]{.underline}** into

[by doing so the [Alliance will avoid]{.mark} paying higher security,

*Climate Change*

Humanity faces existential risks from the large-scale destruction of
Earth's natural environment making the planet less hospitable for
humankind (Wallace-Wells 2019). The decline of some of Earth's natural
systems may already exceed the "planetary boundaries" that represent a
"safe operating space for humanity" (Rockstrom et al. 2009). [Humanity
has become one of the driving forces behind Earth's climate
system]{.underline} (Crutzen 2002). [The major anthropogenic drivers of
climate change are the burning of fossil fuels]{.underline} (e.g., coal,
oil, and gas), [combined with the degradation of Earth's natural systems
for absorbing carbon dioxide, such as deforestation for
agriculture]{.underline} (e.g., livestock and monocultures) [and
resource extraction]{.underline} (e.g., mining and oil), [and the
warming of the oceans]{.underline} (Kump et al. 2003). While humanity
has influenced Earth's climate since at least the Industrial Revolution,
[the dramatic increase in greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline} since
the mid-twentieth century---the "Great Acceleration" (Steffen et al.
2007; 2015; McNeill & Engelke 2016)--- [is responsible for contemporary
climate change]{.underline}, which has reached approximately 1°C above
preindustrial levels (IPCC 2018).

[[Climate]{.mark} change [could **be**]{.mark}come an
**[existential]{.mark} threat** to humanity [if the **planet**]{.mark}'s
climate [reaches a **"Hothouse Earth"**]{.mark} state]{.underline}
(Ripple et al. 2020). What are the dangers? [There are two mechanisms of
climate change that threaten humankind. The direct threat is **extreme
heat**. [While]{.mark} human [societies possesses **some**]{.mark}
capacity for **[adaptation]{.mark}** and **resilience**]{.underline} to
climate change, th[e physiological response of humans to heat stress
imposes **physical limits**]{.underline}---with a hard limit at roughly
35°C wet-bulb temperature (Sherwood et al. 2010). A rise in global
average temperatures by 3--4°C would increase the risk of heat stress,
while 7°C could render some regions uninhabitable, and
[11--**[12°]{.mark}**C [would leave]{.mark} much of [the planet **too
hot for**]{.mark} **human [habitation]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sherwood
et al. 2010). [The [**indirect** effects]{.mark} of climate change could
[include]{.mark}]{.underline}, inter alia, [rising **sea
levels**]{.underline} affecting coastal regions (e.g., Miami and
Shanghai), or even swallowing entire countries (e.g., Bangladesh and the
Maldives); [extreme]{.underline} and unpredictable [**weather** and
**natural [disasters]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., hurricanes and forest
fires); [environmental [pressures on **water** and **food**]{.mark}
**scarcity**]{.underline} (e.g., droughts from less-dispersed rainfall,
and lower wheat-yields at higher temperatures); the possible [inception
of new **bacteria** and [**viruses**; and]{.mark}]{.underline}, of
course, [large-scale human **[migration]{.mark}**]{.underline} (World
Bank 2012; Wallace-Well 2019; Richards, Lupton & Allywood 2001). While
it is difficult to determine the existential implications of extreme
environmental conditions, [there are historic precedents for the
**[collapse of]{.mark} human [societies]{.mark}** under environmental
pressures]{.underline} (Diamond 2005). [Earth's **"big five" mass
extinction events** have been **[link]{.mark}ed** [to]{.mark} dramatic
shifts in Earth's **[climate]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Ward 2008; Payne &
Clapham 2012; Kolbert 2014; Brannen 2017), [and a Hothouse Earth climate
would represent **terra incognita for humanity**]{.underline}.

Thus, the assumption here is that [a Hothouse Earth climate could pose
an **existential threat** to the habitability of the planet for
humanity]{.underline} (Steffen et al. 2018., 5). At what point could
climate change cross the threshold of an existential threat to
humankind? The complexity of Earth's natural systems makes it extremely
difficult to give a precise figure (Rockstrom et al. 2009; ). However,
[much of the concern]{.underline} about climate change [is over the
danger of crossing **"tipping points,"** whereby **[positive]{.mark}
feedback [loops]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Earth's climate system [could
[lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [**[irreversible]{.mark}** and
**self-reinforcing** **["runaway"]{.mark}** climate
[change]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [the melting of **Arctic
"permafrost"** could produce additional warming]{.underline}, as glacial
retreat reduces the refractory effect of the ice and releases huge
quantities of methane currently trapped beneath it. A recent study
suggests that [[a]{.mark} "planetary **[threshold]{.mark}**" could
[exist at]{.mark}]{.underline} global average [temperature of
**[2°]{.mark}**C]{.underline} above preindustrial levels (Steffen et al.
2018; also IPCC 2018). Therefore, the analysis here takes the 2°C rise
in global average temperatures as representing [the **lower-boundary**
of]{.underline} an [existential threat]{.underline} to humanity, [with
**higher temperatures** increasing the risk of **runaway** climate
change leading to a Hothouse Earth]{.underline}.

The [Paris]{.underline} Agreement on Climate Change [set the goal of
limiting the increase]{.underline} in global average temperatures [to
"well below" 2°C]{.underline} and to pursue efforts to limit the
increase to 1.5°C. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark} the [Paris]{.underline}
Agreement [goals are [met]{.mark}]{.underline}, then [[nations
would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[keep climate]{.mark} change
**[below]{.mark} the threshold** of [an **existential threat**]{.mark}
to humanity]{.underline}. According to Climate Action Tracker (2020),
however, current policies of states are expected to produce global
average temperatures of 2.9°C above preindustrial levels by 2100 (range
between +2.1 and +3.9°C), while if states succeed in meeting their
pledges and targets, global average temperatures are still projected to
increase by 2.6°C (range between +2.1 and +3.3°C). Thus, while the Paris
Agreements sets a goal 6 that would reduce the existential risk of
climate change, the actual policies of states could easily cross the
threshold that would constitute an existential threat to humanity (CAT
2020).

Looking back on the history of life on Earth, [the main driver of
species' extinctions have been **changes in climate**]{.underline} over
time [that species could **not adapt to**]{.underline}, even when
provided long spans of time to adapt. [[Given]{.mark} the unnaturally
**[fast]{.mark} rate** of]{.underline} global
[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark} climate change now occurring, [humans
would have to adapt to the **rapid loss** of **habitat** and **food
sources**]{.underline}, as well as all the other impacts, at an
unprecedentedly fast speed. Adding to concerns regarding our survival as
a species, pessimists point out that Homo sapiens are the last of
several humanoid species (Neanderthals, Homo erectus, etc.) that made
Earth their home for millions of years until these prior humanoid
species eventually went extinct because they could not adapt to their
environment and competition for food.

Why the Concern Now About Our Survival as a Species?

While some scientists started raising concerns about the burning of
fossil fuels eventually warming the Earth's atmosphere as far back as
the middle 20th century, a consensus among scientists that global
warming is a problem we have to address didn't form until the later part
of the 20th century.

Now that we're progressing through the 21st century, why are some in
scientific circles raising concerns about our near-term survival as a
species? In recent years, [the [effects of]{.mark} global [warming have
become]{.mark} **exceedingly [extreme]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact,
[[from]{.mark} record-breaking [**heatwaves** to]{.mark} unprecedented
**forest [fires]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} melting **polar [ice]{.mark}**
sheets, the [effects]{.mark} of global warming [are]{.mark} occurring
**[fast]{.mark}**er than the scientific community had projected they
would just a decade or two ago]{.underline}. The concern about our
viability as a species on Earth is due to the fast-developing effects of
global warming. If we don't address the causes of global warming or take
mitigative actions, [[it could **transform** into **runaway**]{.mark}
global warming [that]{.mark} would [heat]{.mark} up the Earth **[so
rapidly]{.mark}** that [humans]{.mark} and many other species
[will]{.mark} likely [be **imperiled**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Many scientists wrongly had confidence that mankind would come to its
senses when faced with the stark reality that our survival as a species
is threatened and we'd collectively take actions to avert catastrophic
global warming by discontinuing our burning of fossil fuels and
replacing them with renewable non-carbon energy sources. However,
despite some tepid efforts to cut carbon emissions, such as the 2016
Paris Agreement, it appears that due to a combination of ignorance and a
concerted effort by the fossil fuels industry to stop any efforts to
move away from carbon-based products, we will likely not address our
continuing release of global warming gases into Earth's atmosphere until
it's too late and the global warming we've experienced in recent decades
transforms into irreversible and catastrophic runaway global warming.

This will occur because [human-caused]{.underline} global [[warming
will]{.mark} eventually [trigger]{.mark} natural climate warming
**[feedback loops]{.mark}** to take over]{.underline}. At that point,
global [warming will be]{.underline} like an
**[unstoppable]{.underline}** runaway train, as the Earth's atmospheric
temperatures rise to life-threatening levels. These warming [feedback
loops include]{.underline} such things as [[releases]{.mark}
of]{.underline} global warming [gases [from]{.mark} melting]{.underline}
polar [[ice sheets and]{.underline}]{.mark} from frozen
[[methane]{.mark} deposits]{.underline} beneath the oceans, [as well
as]{.underline} the [loss of]{.underline} polar [ice
causing]{.underline} the [Earth to absorb more]{.underline} of the sun's
[heat]{.underline} energy. [[All]{.mark} of which will [cause]{.mark}
additional [warming, which]{.mark} then [results in **additional

Would Runaway Global Warming Actually Lead to Human Extinction?

It's a very big step go from runaway global warming to the extinction of
all human beings on Earth. Humans possess the intellectual skills
necessary to design and build technologies that can help us adapt to
climate change. We're also able to move to places with more hospitable
climates. However, some scientists are concerned that [[humans will
**not**]{.mark} have time to **[adapt]{.mark}** to the **quick
pace**]{.underline} of runaway global warming [and]{.underline} some of
[the [impacts will be **too harsh**]{.mark} for us [to
**survive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If farmlands and oceans are no longer capable of providing food for
humans, where will we turn to obtain life-sustaining food? It is
possible that humans could migrate towards the poles and try to farm on
land in those areas that is freed up from the ice. However, it is
unclear if the currently frozen areas in and around the polar regions
will have topsoil suitable for farming. What about freshwater fish?
Unfortunately, freshwater lakes and rivers will also undergo
acidification that will likely wipe out most or all fish species that
can provide humans nourishment. Our only hope might be some sort of
synthetic food that is created in factories using basic elements (a
technology that is certainly viable).

There will be other life-threatening factors that humans will face in a
fast warming world. [Massive **fire balls** from **methane releases**
will create **havoc** for humans]{.underline}. These fireballs will
start enormous forest fires driven by the warmer and in many places a
more arid world, which will cause turmoil for humans. [A lack of
freshwater]{.underline} in areas that undergo desertification [will make
**survival impossible**]{.underline} in such areas. [[**Wars** over
**dwindling resources** will]{.mark} be **fought** out of
**desperation** and could **[end in catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The stress of a warmer world will weaken human immune systems.

is greatly reduced, [**[health]{.mark}**care and medicines might
[become]{.mark} **very [limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}, lowering life

**[pandemics]{.mark}** that [will]{.mark} likely [sweep]{.mark} the
world as opportunistic pathogens take advantage of weakened human

As part of their discussion of BRIHN Baum and Handoh (2014) note that
climate change is the planetary boundary for which the risk to humanity
has received most meaningful consideration and they suggest that this
attention is deserved. Yet little research attention has been paid to
climate change's extreme or catastrophic effects. Kareiva and Carranza
(2018) argue that, despite currently falling outside of the area of high
risk, [[climate]{.mark} change [has]{.mark} the clear [potential to
push]{.mark} humanity [**across a threshold** of **irreversible loss**
by "changing]{.mark} major **[ocean circulation]{.mark}** patterns,
[causing]{.mark} massive [**sea-level rise**, and increasing]{.mark} the
frequency and severity of **[extreme events]{.mark}**... that displace
people, and ruin economies." [**Even if** humanity was resilient to
**each**]{.mark} of these individual impacts, [a **global
catastrophe**]{.mark} could [occur if these]{.mark} impacts were to
[occur **rapidly** and **simultaneously**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

One scenario that has received comparatively more attention is that of
[the global climate [crossing a **tipping point**]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [would [trigger]{.mark} environmental **[feedback loops]{.mark}**
(such as **declining albedo** from melting ice or the release of
**methane** from clathrates) and **cascading effects** (such a
**shifting rainfall patterns** that trigger desertification and soil
erosion)]{.underline}. After this point, anthropogenic activity may
cease to be the main driver of climate change, making it accelerate and
become harder to stop (King et al., 2015).

Other scenarios can be discerned from the numerous historical cases in
which the modest, usually regional, [climatic changes]{.underline}
experienced during the Holocene [have been implicated in the **collapse
of**]{.underline} previous **[societies]{.underline}**, including the
Anasazi, the Tiwanaku, the Akkadians, the Western Roman Empire, the
lowland Maya, and dozens of others (Diamond, 2005, Fagan, 2008). These
provide a precedent for how [a changing [climate can
**trigger**]{.mark}]{.underline} or contribute to **[[societal
breakdown]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At present, our understanding of this
phenomena is limited, and the IPCC has labelled its findings as "low
confidence" due to a lack of understanding of cause and effect and
restrictions in historical data (Klein et al., 2014). Further study and
cooperation between archaeologists, historians, climate scientists and
global catastrophic risk scholars could overcome some of these
limitations by identifying how the impacts of climate change translate
into social transformation and collapse, and hence what the impacts of
more rapid and extreme climatic changes might be. There is also the
potential for larger studies into how global climate variations have
coincided with collapse and violence at the regional level (Zhang,
Chiyung, Chusheng, Yuanqing, & Fung, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006). However,
these need to be interpreted and generalized with care given the
differences between pre-industrial and modern societies.

Societies also have a long history of adapting to, and recovering from,
climate change induced collapses (McAnany and Yoffee, 2009). However,
[there are]{.underline} two [reasons to [be sceptical]{.mark}
that]{.underline} such [[resilience can be]{.mark} easily
[extrapolated]{.mark} into the future. First, the]{.underline}
relatively [stable context of the Holocene, with]{.underline}
well-functioning, [resilient ecosystems]{.underline}, has [greatly
assisted recovery, while]{.underline} anthropogenic [climate [change
is]{.mark} more **[rapid]{.mark}**, **pervasive**, [**global**, and
**severe**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Large-scale states did not emerge until
the onset of the Holocene (Richerson, Boyd, & Bettinger, 2001), and
societies have since remained in a surprisingly narrow climatic niche of
roughly 15 mean annual average temperature (Xu, Kohler, Lenton,
Svenning, & Scheffer, 2020). A return to agrarian or hunter-gatherer
lifestyles could thus have more devastating and long-lasting effects in
a world of rapid climate change and ecological disruption (Gowdy,
2020).7 [Second, modern human [societies]{.mark} may have
[developed]{.mark} **hidden [fragilities]{.mark}** [that
**amplify**]{.mark} **the [shocks]{.mark}** posed by climate
change]{.underline} (Mannheim 2020) [[and]{.mark} the [complex]{.mark},
**tightly-coupled** and **[interdependent]{.mark}** nature of our
socio-economic [systems makes it]{.mark} **more [likely]{.mark}** that
the [**failure** of a **few**]{.mark} **key states** or industries due
to climate change could [**cascade** into]{.mark} a **[global
collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Kemp, 2019).

A third set of plausible scenarios stem from climate change's broader
environmental impacts. Apart from being a planetary boundary of its own,
Steffen et al. (2015) point out that climate change is intimately
connected with other planetary boundaries (see Table 1). Climate change
is thus identified by the authors as one of two 'core\' boundaries with
the potential "to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be
substantially and persistently transgressed." This transformative
potential was elaborated on in subsequent work exploring how the world
could be pushed towards a 'Hothouse Earth' state, even with
anthropogenic temperature rises as low as 2 °C (Steffen et al., 2018).

The connection between climate change and biosphere integrity (the
survival of complex adaptive ecosystems supporting diverse forms of
life) is particularly strong. The IPCC is highly confident that climate
change is adversely impacting terrestrial ecosystems, contributing to
desertification and land degradation in many areas and changing the
range, abundance and seasonality of many plant and animal species
(Arneth et al., 2019). Similarly, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy
Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has reported
that climate change is restricting the range of nearly half the world's
threatened mammal species and a quarter of threatened birds, with
marine, coastal, and arctic ecosystems worst affected (Diaz et al.,
2019). According to one estimate, climate change could cause 15--37 % of
all species to become 'committed to extinction' by mid-century (Thomas
et al., 2004).

Disruption to biosphere integrity can have profound economic and social
repercussions, ranging from loss of ecosystem services and natural
resources to the destruction of traditional knowledge and livelihoods.
For instance, desertification, which threatens a quarter of Earth's land
area and a fifth of the population, is already estimated to cost
developing nations 4--8 % of their GDP (United Nations, 2011). Many
other rapid regime shifts involving loss of biosphere integrity have
been observed, including shifts in arid vegetation, freshwater
eutrophication, and the collapse of fish populations (Amano et al.
2020). There is a theoretical possibility of still more profound regime
shifts at the global level (Rocha, Peterson, Bodin, & Levin, 2018).
However, the contribution of loss of biosphere integrity to GCR is yet
to be assessed. Kareiva and Carranza (2018) argue that it is unlikely to
threaten human civilization, due both to a lack of plausible mechanisms
for this threat and the fact that "local and regional biodiversity is
often staying the same because species from elsewhere replace local
losses." However, in their classification of GCRs, Avin et al. (2018)
suggest the potential for ecological collapse to threaten the safety
boundaries of multiple critical systems with diverse spread mechanisms
at a range of scales, from the biogeochemical and anatomical to the
ecological and sociotechnological. Note that both these studies were
conducted for largely conceptual purposes and should not be taken as
rigorous analyses of this risk, this topic warrants further
investigation.

3.2. Classifying climate change's contributions to global catastrophic
risk

Climate change\'s contribution to GCR goes well beyond its impact on the
earth system. Taking Avin et al.'s list of critical systems, we note
that previous studies have mostly focused on the effects of climate
change on physical and biogeochemical systems (e.g. global temperature
and sea-level rise) or the lower-level critical systems that are most
directly related to human health and survival (e.g. Heath Stress).
However, these represent a very limited assessment of risk as it only
accounts for climate change as a direct hazard/threat and our
\"ontological\" vulnerabilities to it. A more comprehensive risk
assessment must consider the higher-order critical systems threatened by
climate change passively (through a lack of alternatives) and actively
(through intentional design).

[The probability of]{.underline} a [**global catastrophe** is higher
when **sociotechnological** and **environmental** systems are **tightly
coupled**, creating a potential for **[reinforcing]{.mark} feedback
[loops]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If environmental change produces social
changes that perpetuate further environmental change, then this could
actively work against our efforts at adaptation. When this change has
the potential to produce significant harm, via human vulnerabilities and
exposure, [[we describe]{.mark} such loops [as **'global systems death
spirals.'**]{.mark}]{.underline} These spirals could produce
self-perpetuating catastrophes, whereby the energy and resources
required to reverse or adapt to collapse are beyond the means of
dwindling human societies. Feedback loops like this could thus create
tipping points beyond which returning to anything like present
conditions would become extremely difficult. Global systems would shift
to very different states in which [the [**prospects for humanity**
would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[be **bleak**]{.underline}]{.mark}er.

with]{.underline} all three major powers---**[China, Russia, and the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates---[rushing to deploy
a]{.underline} **[host of new munitions]{.underline}**. This dangerous
process commenced a decade ago, when Russian and Chinese leaders sought
improvements to their nuclear arsenals and President Barack Obama, in
order to secure Senate approval of the New Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty of 2010, agreed to initial funding for the modernization of all
three legs of America's strategic triad, which encompasses submarines,
intercontinental ballistic missiles, and bombers. (New START, which
mandated significant reductions in US and Russian arsenals, will expire
in February 2021 unless renewed by the two countries.) Although Obama
initiated the modernization of the nuclear triad, the Trump
administration has sought funds to proceed with their full-scale
production, at an estimated initial installment of \$500 billion over 10
years.

Even during the initial modernization program of the Obama era, Russian
and Chinese leaders were sufficiently alarmed to hasten their own
nuclear acquisitions. Both countries were already in the process of
modernizing their stockpiles---Russia to replace Cold War--era systems
that had become unreliable, China to provide its relatively small
arsenal with enhanced capabilities. Trump's decision to acquire a whole
new suite of ICBMs, nuclear-armed submarines, and bombers has added
momentum to these efforts. And with all three major powers upgrading
their arsenals, the other nuclear-weapon states---led by India,
Pakistan, and North Korea---have been expanding their stockpiles as
well. Moreover, with Trump's recent decision to abandon the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, all major powers are
developing missile delivery systems for a regional **[[nuclear

Workforce

[NATO will need staff]{.underline} officers, civilian personnel, [and
other augmentees]{.underline} [who]{.underline} not only
[are]{.underline} **[steeped in the technical aspects of
cyberspace]{.underline}** [but also understand]{.underline}
[how]{.underline} [cyberspace op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline} [can
contribute to]{.underline} the overall [success of NATO
operations]{.underline} and how other domains can reinforce the cyber
domain. NATO is starting to adapt its educational curriculum to address
the full array of cyberspace issues. The NATO Communications and
Information Agency has built a new school in Portugal to support its
mission and teach staff about the operation of NATO IT systems.53 Other
academic institutions, such as the NATO Defence College, the NATO School
Oberammergau, or the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence,
should also implement courses focusing on cyberspace as a domain of
operations.

The [competition for skilled cybersecurity personnel is well
documented]{.underline}. The [cybersecurity]{.underline} certification
[organization]{.underline}, (ISC)2 , [noted]{.underline} in a recent
report that the workforce **[shortage of these
professionals]{.underline}** is [growing globally]{.underline},
[reaching]{.underline} almost **[three million positions]{.underline}**
[in 2018]{.underline}.54 Nearly half of the surveyed organizations for
that report expected to increase cybersecurity staffing in the next
year, underscoring that **[demand will grow,]{.underline}** [not
diminish]{.underline}. [NATO]{.underline} [undoubtedly]{.underline} will
be among those organizations [competing in the labor marketplace for
skilled cybersecurity]{.underline} professionals, but as we have seen,
[it wi]{.underline}ll **[require more than technical]{.underline}**
**[staff]{.underline}**. It will need to educate its leadership, both
military and civilian, [in]{.underline} the [technical, operational,
legal, and]{.underline} [policy topics of cyberspace.]{.underline}

Officers and civilian personnel assigned to NATO on rotations will come
with varied backgrounds and experience for the positions they will fill.
Some positions, such as in the cyber offices at Allied Command
Operations (ACO), ACT, and the [new]{.underline} **[CyOC]{.underline}**
will clearly **[need personnel]{.underline}** [who have a deeper
experience]{.underline} [than]{.underline} the [broader
organization]{.underline}, something that will likely rely on personnel
from a subset of the member nations for the near future, given the wide
variance in national experience in cyberspace. But **[other parts of
NATO]{.underline}** will **[also need to draw on cyber
expertise]{.underline}** [to ensure cyberspace integration]{.underline}
into operations, [including]{.underline} [at]{.underline} the various
[operational headquarters]{.underline}. A first step to ensuring that
qualified personnel are assigned (part of which has already been
completed by the NATO Command Structure Adaptation that reviewed, among
others, ACT and ACO cyber positions) is to evaluate and enumerate the
specific job functions and associated qualifications for cyber-related
positions across the alliance. These can include planners, operators,
cyber defenders, acquisition personnel, and even less-obvious areas such
as public diplomacy.

NATO relies on its member nations to send qualified personnel on
rotation, but NATO also has longer-serving staff among its civilian
personnel. Whether employees have served for three years or 30, NATO
will want to ensure that its cyber workforce has a baseline of skills
and knowledge and develop progressive educational modules to grow and
sustain its human capital. As already noted, the baseline will vary
depending on the work roles and job series a person occupies. The U.S.
Department of Defense (DoD) has developed a DoD Cyber Workforce
Framework that encompasses four main categories of personnel: cyberspace
IT, cybersecurity, cyberspace effects, and intelligence.55 NATO could
also look to bring in expertise on short-term assignments similar to the
U.S. Defense Digital Service.56 It could also develop industry fellows
programs to give its permanent staff experience in the private sector,
similar to the U.S. Secretary of Defense Executive Fellows program.57
These programs could inject new thinking and bring valuable
private-sector experience to bear. NATO's educational institutions will
play a critical role in developing and sustaining the cyberspace
workforce for the alliance, starting with instituting courses that cover
relevant topics, from strategy and policy to more technical areas. Some
suggested topics to include in a first orientation course that
establishes the baseline (some of which are already being taught) would
include

• NATO organizational structure and national-level organizations that
interface with the alliance. This would include covering the roles and
responsibilities of the NCIRC, ACO Cyber Division, ACT Cyber
Capabilities Branch, and the CyOC, as well as national-level
cybercommands and EU institutions strategic and operational planning,
including how cyber operations fit into the COPD and the NATO Crisis
Management Process.

• technical topics for those less familiar with the layers of the cyber
domain, from the physical infrastructure to the virtual or "cyber
persona" domain.

• cyberspace capabilities in the alliance and at the national level,
including defensive capabilities.

• the legal and policy frameworks for cyber operations, including the
law of armed conflict and its application to the cyber domain,
operational authorities, and NATO declarations and policies. Finally,
NATO will need to address how it recruits and retains personnel to
identify opportunities for attracting talent and taking advantage of
expertise. Initiatives could include offering limited-term appointments
from the private sector, scholarship-for-service, and developing
stronger ties with academic institutions across the alliance.

Conclusion

For NATO to achieve the ambitious goals it has set for itself in
Ministerial statements, it will take sustained effort and dedication.
Each member has a role to play, at the very least in shoring up its own
cyber defenses, as well as contributing to the extent it can and is fit
for purpose to the overall defense of the alliance. In this section, we
highlighted key areas to focus on in terms of defining cyberspace
functions, exercises and training, and workforce development, but as is
often the case, there are numerous other areas requiring focus. Numerous
members large and small have clear capabilities in cyberspace.
Harnessing those capabilities in an integrated manner will not happen
overnight, but NATO

has the capacity and mechanisms to accomplish its goals.

Preparing for the Future:

Indications and Warning Against

Cyber Threats to NATO

Why I&W Against Cyber Threats?

Effective and timely I&W of cyber threats is a vital component of any
cyber strategy because they can provide early detection and advance
notification of cyber threats. This early warning can facilitate
avoidance or mitigation of potentially harmful attacks by providing
decisionmakers with needed time to consider options and authorize and
implement preventive actions. Yet none of the cyber strategies released
by the United States or its federal agencies discuss I&W in detail.
National cyber strategies of other NATO members likewise do not
elaborate on I&W of cyber threats, likely due to the lack of clearly
established definitions or best practices on how to construct I&W
frameworks in the cyber domain. The need to constantly refine and adapt
these frameworks to the evolving threat actors provides further
challenges for establishing a standardized cyber I&W model.

It is specifically because of these challenges that it becomes critical
to identify the main parameters of an effective cyber I&W framework. For
example, cyber I&W will help to ensure robust defense of the alliance's
cyberspace and continuous operation of NATO's cyber infrastructure in
support of strategic and operational planning. I&W capabilities for the
cyber domain are also directly related to the functional areas of as
described in Figure 1. To be effective at predicting and detecting
threats to cyberspace, I&W frameworks require both horizontal (NATO-wide
and across NATO members) and vertical (within NATO entities, nations,
and sectors) integration and collaboration, including national
contributions and collaboration between nation-states and national
entities at multiple levels. Thus, designing rigorous I&W frameworks in
cyberspace is a complex challenge that requires a number of key steps:
crafting a strategy for cooperation and communication among NATO
entities, NATO members and partners, and other public-private entities;
developing information-sharing protocols that ensure timely and
continuous data exchange; and integrating I&W cyber frameworks in joint
cyber exercises to improve I&W applications.

Despite the significance of the field and some promising steps toward
improving cyber I&W capabilities, frameworks for cyber I&W are still
evolving and are not yet mature.58 The importance of I&W methods,
combined with their relatively recent and underdeveloped application to
cyberspace, suggests this issue warrants special attention.

In their process of designing a robust and adaptable cyber I&W
framework, NATO entities may benefit from understanding how mature I&W
frameworks from other domains in U.S. intelligence can be adapted to the
cyber domain. Such I&W frameworks offer a way of thinking about security
threats and provide methods for designing and structuring detection and
response mechanisms.

In this section, we first define I&W, and then outline the publicly
known progress that NATO has already achieved in relation to building
its cyber I&W capabilities. We then propose a general framework for
cyber I&W and discuss how NATO can further develop, adopt, and integrate
cyber I&W capabilities within its current planning processes and
operations. We conclude with an overview of several critical issues that
we believe NATO entities should address to ensure that the alliance
meets its missioncritical objectives in cyberspace.

What is Cyber Indications and Warning?

Cyber I&W focuses on collecting actionable information about threats to
cyberspace that may provide early detection and warning of impending
malicious cyberactivity. However, there is still no consensus regarding
the concept of indications and warning. Some liken it to cyber threat
intelligence and therefore focus on information directly pertaining to
impending threats without analyzing broader strategic-level factors that
can affect the behavior of a threat. Others define cyber I&W as a
methodology that includes monitoring for indications of an impending
threat, understanding the context in which this information is being
collected, and performing strategic-level assessments of these
indicators that can affect the behavior or nature of an impending
cyberattack.5

Publicly available U.S. doctrine offers some insights applicable to the
NATO context that can serve as a starting point for discussion. U.S.
Joint Publication 2.0 stipulates that warning intelligence---a concept
the DoD has recently adopted instead of indications and
warning---includes "those intelligence activities intended to detect and
report time-sensitive intelligence information on foreign developments
that forewarn of hostile actions or intention."60 Joint Publication 3-12
further stipulates that warning intelligence should be based on
"all-source analysis in order to factor in political, military, and
technical warning intelligence" and that "cyberspace threat sensors may
recognize malicious activity with only a very short time available to
respond."61 While these definitions characterize the nature of cyber I&W
concepts, they do not provide a full explanation of how to design an I&W
framework.

The term indications and warning has a formal meaning in NATO and is
supported through a set of processes governed by the member states with
strong involvement by their intelligence communities.62 Yet NATO does
not publicly offer a formal definition of what constitutes I&W in the
cyber domain. Official public NATO documents provide only some insights;
for instance, NATO's 2018 Glossary of Terms and Definitions defines
strategic warning as "\[a\] notification that hostilities may be
imminent. This notification may occur at any time prior to the
initiation of hostilities." The document also defines tactical warning
as "\[a\] notification that a local enemy attack is imminent. This
notification may occur at any time from the indication of a probable
attack until just prior to the target being struck or engaged."63 The
glossary defines indicator as "an item of information which reflects the
intention or capability of a potential enemy to adopt or reject a course
of action."64 Although informative, these definitions provide only a
general understanding of what activities constitute I&W. One distinction
that can be made is separately defining indications from warnings. One
may consider that there are indicators at various levels: strategic
indicators (usually based on intelligence); operational indicators
(combining intelligence and technical information); and tactical
indicators (technical intrusion---malware, phishing, etc.). Warnings
describe how and when to relay the indicators to the field.

Finally, the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA), a
U.S.-based nonprofit organization that facilitates collaboration between
the private and public sectors concerning national security and
intelligence,65 defines I&W against cyber threats as "an analytic
process where an anticipated scenario in cyberspace is decomposed into
indicators that can be continuously monitored to provide warning of the
scenario coming to fruition."66 We propose to adapt this definition to
the NATO context and emphasize NATO's primary area of responsibility and
the political utility of I&W frameworks. We therefore define I&W for
cyber threats as "an analytical process focused on collecting and
analyzing information from a broad array of sources to develop
indicators which can facilitate the prediction, early detection, and
warning of cyber incidents relative to one's information environment."67
These indicators are then continuously monitored to provide warning of
the scenario coming to fruition as much in advance as possible, allowing
NATO to take preventive action.

Before we outline our framework, we first describe how NATO has already
prepared its infrastructure for addressing, at least in part, cyber I&W

How Has NATO Already Prepared for Cyber I&W?

NATO has made significant progress in elevating the importance of the
cyber domain and setting up the structural foundations for the effective
adoption and integration of cyber I&W frameworks. In particular,

> • At the Wales Summit in September 2014, NATO adopted an action plan
> for enhancing cyber defense, which was subsequently updated in
> February 2017.68
>
> • At the Warsaw Summit in 2016, NATO members agreed to prioritize the

>
> • At the Brussels 2018 summit, NATO members discussed collaboration

> plan, which contains "concrete objectives and implementation timelines
> on a range of topics from capability development, education, training
> and exercises, and partnerships" to include, for example, allied

> their security controls.7

NATO has made significant progress in standing up NATO entities and
capabilities to implement or be involved in the implementation of I&W
frameworks for cyber threats. Some of the principal NATO organizations
include

> NCIRC, operated by NCIA and based at SHAPE in Mons, Belgium, is
> responsible for protecting NATO's networks. NCIRC monitors, prevents,
> detects, and responds to cybersecurity incidents and provides
> centralized cyber defense support to NATO sites.72 In 2006, NCIRC

> capabilities in cyberspace.77
>
> • NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre, a multinational organization
> operating under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SHAPE,
> provides the primary intelligence analytical support.7

NATO's educational structures have also substantially evolved and
expanded their cyber education and training. NATO's principal
educational institutions include

> • the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in
> Tallinn, Estonia, a NATOaccredited research and training center
> providing education, consultation, research, and development in the
> area of cybersecurity
>
> • the NATO Communications and Information Systems School in Latina,
> Italy, which provides training on operating and maintaining NATO's
> communication and information systems to personnel from NATO members
> and allied nations79
>
> • the NATO School in Oberammergau, Germany, which provides cyber
> defense education and training in support of NATO operations, policy,
> doctrine, strategy, and procedures
>
> • the NATO Defense College in Rome, Italy, which emphasizes strategic
> education on cyber defense issues.80

NATO entities and allies have also recognized the importance of
partnering with the private sector. Some of the benefits of such
cooperation include establishing sharing of best practices and lessons
learned and ensuring the timely supply and analysis of actionable cyber
threat information. One of the primary channels through which NATO
strengthens its collaboration with private partners is the NATO Industry
Cyber Partnership. The partnership includes NATO structures, national
CERTs, and industry representatives of NATO members. The partnerships
include information-sharing activities, training, exercises, and
multinational Smart Defence81 projects.8

Adopting Strategic Intelligence Frameworks to Cyberspace in the NATO
Context

Despite significant progress in building cyber capabilities and
integrating them into existing NATO planning, operations, and C2
structures, I&W for cyberspace is still a relatively immature
discipline. Therefore, NATO and its components can benefit by adopting
well-established and tested frameworks from more mature disciplines,
which provide actionable policy-relevant recommendations related to the
detection and assessment of security threats. For instance, cyber I&W
concepts can leverage the I&W frameworks used by U.S. strategic
intelligence, the Department of Homeland Security, or Cyber Command. The
U.S. intelligence community has been developing and improving these
frameworks since World War II to assess and monitor potentially
threatening actions by U.S. adversaries in an attempt to avoid surprise
attacks, such as the attack against Pearl Harbor in 1941.83

Among the most well-known warning intelligence frameworks are former
senior intelligence analyst Cynthia Grabo's comprehensive methodology
for warning intelligence, Jonathan Lockwood's Analytical Method for
Prediction, and the U.S. Defense Warning Network conceptual framework.84
However, the cyber I&W framework produced by INSA reflects components of
these traditional I&W intelligence frameworks and provides an
appropriate model that can be adapted to the NATO context.85 INSA's
framework is a useful starting point for building a cyber I&W foundation
because it was based on tradecraft from the U.S. intelligence community
in consultation with governmental, academic, and private sector
representatives and is one of the only publicly available documents on
this topic. INSA's original I&W framework contains the following seven
steps: (1) identify and prioritize assets, (2) refine the threat, (3)
assess threat courses of action, (4) break down scenarios into
indicators, (5) plan and exercise countermeasures, (6) align to the
intelligence cycle (collect information for each indicator from Step 4),
and (7) execute proactive countermeasures.

While this framework is valuable and While this framework is valuable
and fills a gaping void for publicly available information on cyber I&W,
its steps are too broad for our purposes. Therefore, we will adapt it to
the NATO context and outline how NATO can apply these stages below. We
closely adhere to the steps proposed by INSA but modify the sequence of
Steps 5 and 6 to emphasize the need to establish data collection
mechanisms for the indicators identified in Step 4 first, before
planning and practicing countermeasures. In effect, one needs to be
assured that the indicators are properly collected before responding to
them.86 We further discuss establishing standard operating procedures,
exercising the planned countermeasures, and aligning them to NATO's
communication and command structure in Step 6---this is necessary due to
the tightly interconnected nature of these aspects of the process. For
each step, we propose how NATO entities, allies, and partners can apply
it to increase the effectiveness of their I&W capabilities by
standardizing their operational protocols and decisionmaking processes.
The RAND modified cyber I&W framework consists of the following steps:87

1\. Identify and prioritize mission-critical assets.

2\. Maintain an updated list of top cyber threats.

3\. Construct scenarios of potential cyberattacks.

4\. Decompose scenarios into observable indicators.

5\. Establish data collection methods and sources and set up a
collection requirement and prioritization matrix.

6\. Establish standard operating procedures and exercise chain of
communication and command in different scenarios.

Finally, it is important to recognize that some of the steps described
below relate to common cybersecurity practices. However, the steps
involving scenario development and identification of appropriate
indicators are distinct and unique to a cyber I&W framework. This
exercise is not meant to define a highly detailed framework but merely
to highlight the key first steps the alliance should consider on its
journey to operationalizing cyberspace.

Step 1: Identify and Prioritize Mission-Critical Assets

[NATO's]{.underline} [high visibility]{.underline} and central role in
the Western security architecture [make it an attractive target
for]{.underline} a variety of [malicious cyber
intrusions]{.underline}.88 The chief of cybersecurity at the NATO
Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) asserts that NATO detects
about 550 million suspicious events daily. Although NATO is constantly
seeking to improve its cybersecurity, **[it is challenging to monitor,
analyze, and]{.underline}** **[act upon all of these
events]{.underline}**.89 [NATO's cyber]{.underline} I&W
[capabilities]{.underline}, therefore, [must]{.underline} [be able to
differentiate between]{.underline} security alerts that represent a
**[meaningful threat]{.underline}** to the alliance (or are precursors
to an attack) [from]{.underline} activities that constitute [operational
noise]{.underline} that can be ignored.90

Suggested actions: To achieve this goal, [NATO should]{.underline}
leverage its mission assurance efforts to first [determine]{.underline}
a list of **[priority assets]{.underline}**. The continued development
of such a [list should stem from NATO's primary mission]{.underline} [to
ensure collective defense]{.underline} and security of all its members,
including the protection of communications systems that are owned and
operated by the alliance.91 NATO can further focus on supporting the
protection of C2 nodes on NATO-based military sites that coordinate
operations of major offensive military platforms, as well as
telecommunications and electric grid systems, on which militaries
heavily rely for intelligence, logistics, operations, and
communications.92

The war in [Ukraine]{.underline} has [provided]{.underline} a [wake-up
call for U.S. military cyber defenders]{.underline}, [who are facing
hard choices]{.underline} [about]{.underline} **[how to deploy limited
resources]{.underline}**, said Air Force Brig. Gen. Chad D. Raduege, the
chief information officer of U.S. European Command.

"There's been a realization that, quite frankly, **[we can't protect
everything we have]{.underline}**," Raduege told a virtual luncheon
hosted by the Gabriel Chapter of the Air Force Association on March 9.

He added that this realization had been growing for some time. In his
prior job in 2021 as chief information officer of [Air
Combat]{.underline} Command, "we found ourselves ... identifying the key
\[IT\] components for us to fly, fight, and win. And we were [applying
mission defense teams from]{.underline} a [cyber component
against]{.underline} those weapon systems and saying, these are our
[crown jewels that we need to protect]{.underline}."

But [faced]{.underline} [with]{.underline} a **[crisis that is demanding

variety of [partners]{.underline}, meaning small teams operating from
unfamiliar locations, [there **weren't enough cyber defense
teams**]{.underline} [to go around]{.underline}, Raduege said, answering
an audience question from retired Maj. Gen. Burke E. "Ed" Wilson, the
former deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy, who
previously commanded Air Forces Cyber.

"I think the area that we've got to continue to figure out is this idea
that we were going \[to\] protect the weapon systems themselves, protect
those smaller groups, with our mission defense teams. That's a really
great vision. What we found is [we didn't have enough capacity
in]{.underline} the [cyber realm to even stand up]{.underline} some of
those [capabilities]{.underline}," Raduege said.

He said [the Air Force is deciding which weapon systems it can **afford
to protect**]{.underline}.

**Cyberspace resources are [scarce]{.underline} and [on

Authorities show [lack of skills that needs to be addressed]{.underline}

In her article Maigre also pointed to the [worrying global shortage of
relevant skills]{.underline}. [According]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
the White House\'s **[cybersecurity]{.underline}** coordinator, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [alone]{.underline} is [short
of some 300,000 personnel.]{.underline}

[Adding to this are **scarce resources**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[talent constraints]{.underline}** [in the public sector]{.underline},
along with a lack of coordination among agencies even of single
governments and authorities in countries around the world only slowly
reacting to developments that often happen at break-neck speed.

And though [political leaders]{.underline} by now [are making
cybersecurity a campaign]{.underline} and policy issue, their
understanding just how and why the subject should be approached in
detail is often insufficient.

[To make up for this lack of readiness]{.underline} and skills,
organizations as well as governments should invest in preparation, which
in turn requires knowledge. A solid knowledge base [for cyber
defense]{.underline} can only be developed in practice, which means that
what is needed is a community of specialists and teams.

In practice, this means that both the [military]{.underline} and
civilian authorities **[need to know about
cross-dependencies]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[the different
systems]{.underline}** [in use]{.underline}. As [it is
already]{.underline} [done at the cyberdefense center in
Tallinn]{.underline}, exercises need to be based on scenarios that are
as close as possible to real life.

Apart from the technological dimension [there is also the **legal**
and]{.underline} the [**diplomatic** realm]{.underline}, both of which
are important here. [How should a country react to being]{.underline}
[attacked]{.underline} if [it isn\'t]{.underline} immediately [obvious
where]{.underline} exactly [the attack is coming from? Once the country
of origin is identified, what then?]{.underline}

A hostile operation in cyberspace is taxed as an attack not based on
whether it is directed against public or private infrastructure or
against military or civilian personnel, but by the scale and effects of
the operation. This is where international law comes in, as it is
important to interpret an individual attack based on the existing legal
means.

All of this is of great importance in a domain where [politics can get
lost in technical and legal matters]{.underline}.

DETERRENCE BY DENIAL

If NATO wants to deny Russia the ability to successfully attack one or
more Baltic states, it has little choice but to deploy forces on a much
larger scale than it currently does. Such forces could be deployed
gradually to avoid giving Russia a casus belli and to make such
deployments more palatable to skeptical NATO members. The 2017 RAND
study proposed deployments of around 35,000 personnel, with an
additional reinforcement capability of up to about 70,000 personnel;1
this would certainly prevent a Russian military fait accompli and force
Moscow to fight a bloody and drawn-out conventional war, should it
attack. These deployments would also, perhaps, eliminate most of the
difficulties---and some of the resulting escalation pathways---that stem
from the alliance's current need to reinforce troops rapidly and on a
large scale in a crisis. In addition, these troop deployments would
raise the costs to Moscow of deliberately forcing a military crisis with
NATO.

While such measures might mitigate the short-term risk of deliberate
Russian escalation, they would create a number of severe political
trade-offs. First, a deterrence-by-denial approach would risk
overstretching the delicate political consensus among NATO members about
conventional deterrence and assurance. A number of member states,
perhaps led by Germany and France, would not support such a policy and
would seek to block it. Even more importantly, perhaps, not even the
Baltic states are supportive of such a maximalist approach. While many
Baltic officials and experts would like to see greater U.S. military
engagement in the region, some of them are highly skeptical of the
assumptions underlying the RAND war games and think that they are too
pessimistic about Baltic defenses. While they would like to see a
strong, unified allied response to the growing threat from Russia, they
also recognize the need to avoid unnecessarily escalating general
tensions with Russia.2 Also, against the background of often contentious
debates within NATO about financial and military burden sharing, it
would not be clear at all who would provide the necessary funds and
forces for such a large military footprint. Neither the United States
nor most other allies currently seem to be both willing and capable.

Second, instead of preventing deliberate Russian escalation this
deterrence-by-denial approach could, in fact, reinforce Russian
perceptions of insecurity. Russia would be loath to accept a NATO force
that size so close to its borders. Moscow might seek to prevent NATO
force deployments through various means, including, not inconceivably,
by considering the preventive use of force (that is, Russia might wage a
war because it could only see its position deteriorating in the future).
This risk might become more acute in the early stages of a crisis when
Russia could misinterpret the large-scale movement of sizable forces,
such as the 70,000 personnel reinforcement the RAND study suggested, as
NATO preparations for a preemptive attack on Russia. Third, large-scale
conventional deployments could help further solidify Russian reliance on
its nuclear deterrent and could even serve to lower Russia's threshold
for nuclear use, making the early employment of nuclear weapons more
likely.

CLIMATE TRENDS

[Beyond exhibiting **extreme overconfidence** [in]{.mark} a
**[cherry-picked analysis]{.mark}** of climate-change
causes]{.underline}, politicians and [[activists]{.mark} frequently
[ground]{.mark} their [**alarmism** in **frightening
predictions**]{.mark} about consequences that are likewise **far from
certain**]{.underline}. This is not only true within the very new (and
still quite unreliable) field of predictive climate science; it is true
even in the context of ongoing climate phenomena. Indeed, politicians
and [journalists frequently characterize dramatic]{.underline} or
unusual [climate phenomena as the product of anthropogenic climate
change, [yet there is **little ev**]{.mark}idence [to support]{.mark}
those [claims]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For one thing, [[there is no]{.mark} observable upward [trend in]{.mark}
the number of ["hot" days]{.mark} between 1895 and 2017; 11 of the 12
years with the highest number of such days occurred before
1960]{.underline}. Since 2005, [NOAA has maintained the]{.underline}
U.S. [Climate Reference Network]{.underline}, comprising 114
meticulously maintained temperature stations spaced more or less
uniformly across the lower 48 states, along with 21 stations in Alaska
and two stations in Hawaii. They are placed to avoid heat-island effects
and other such distortions as much as possible. [The **reported data**
show **no increase** in average temperatures over the available
2005-2020 period. In addition, [a]{.mark} recent [reconstruction
of]{.mark} global **[temp]{.mark}**erature[**s** over]{.mark} the past
**[1 million years]{.mark}** --- created using data from ice-sheet
formations --- [shows]{.mark} that there is **[nothing unusual]{.mark}**
about the current warm period]{.underline}.

Rising sea levels are another frequently cited example of impending
climate crisis. And yet [sea levels have been rising since at least the
**mid-19th century**]{.underline}. This rise is tied closely with the
end of the Little Ice Age that occurred not long before, which led to a
rise in global temperatures, some melting of sea ice, and a thermal
expansion of sea water. There is some evidence showing an acceleration
in sea-level rise beginning in the early 1990s: Satellite measurements
of sea levels began in 1992 and show a sea-level rise of about 3.2
millimeters per year between 1993 and 2010. Before 1992, when sea levels
were measured with tidal gauges, the data showed an increase of about
1.7 millimeters per year on average from 1901 to 1990.

But because the [datasets are from]{.underline} two [different
sources]{.underline} --- satellite measurements versus tidal
gauges --- they are not directly comparable, [and]{.underline} therefore
they [cannot be interpreted as showing an acceleration in sea-level
rises]{.underline}. Moreover, [the period beginning in]{.underline}
19[**93** is short in terms of global climate phenomena]{.underline}.
Since sea levels have risen at a constant rate, remained constant, or
even fallen during similar relatively short periods, [inferences drawn
from them are **problematic**]{.underline}. It is of course possible
there has been an acceleration in sea-level rise, but even still, it
would not be clear whether such a development stemmed primarily from
anthropogenic or natural causes; clearly, both processes are relevant.

[A study of changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice yields **very
different** inferences]{.underline}. Since 1979, [[Arctic]{.mark} sea
[ice]{.mark} has [declined]{.mark}]{.underline} relative to the 30-year
average (again, the degree to which this is the result of anthropogenic
factors is not known). [[Meanwhile, Antarctic]{.mark} sea ice [has been
**growing**]{.mark}]{.underline} relative to the 30-year average, [and
the [global sea-ice]{.mark} total has **[remained]{.mark}**]{.underline}
roughly **[[constant]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1979.

[Extreme weather occurrences are likewise used as evidence of an ongoing
climate crisis, but again, a **study** of the **available data**
undercuts that assessment]{.underline}. U.S. [tornado activity
shows]{.underline} either [no increase]{.underline} or a downward trend
since 1954. [Data on tropical storms, hurricanes, and accumulated
cyclone energy]{.underline} (a wind-speed index measuring the overall
strength of a given hurricane season) [reveal little change since
satellite measurements of the phenomena began in the early]{.underline}
19[**70s**. The number of wildfires]{.underline} in the United States
[shows no upward trend]{.underline} since 1985, [and global acreage
burned has **declined**]{.underline} over past decades. The Palmer
Drought Severity Index shows no trend since 1895. And the IPCC's Fifth
Assessment Report, published in 2014, displays substantial divergence
between its discussion of the historical evidence on droughts and the
projections on future droughts yielded by its climate models. Simply
put, the available data do not support the ubiquitous assertions about
the causal link between greenhouse-gas accumulation, temperature change,
and extreme weather events and conditions.

Unable to demonstrate that observed climate trends are due to
anthropogenic climate change --- or even that these events are
particularly unusual or concerning --- [climate
catastrophists]{.underline} will often [turn to **[dire
predictions]{.mark}**]{.underline} about prospective climate phenomena.
[The problem]{.underline} with such predictions [is]{.underline} that
[they [are]{.mark} almost always [generated by]{.mark} climate [models
driven by **highly complex**]{.mark} **sets of [assumptions]{.mark}**
about which there is **significant dispute**. Worse, these models are
[**notorious** for **failing**]{.mark} to accurately predict already
documented changes in climate]{.underline}. As climatologist Patrick
Michaels of the Competitive Enterprise Institute notes:

> [[During **all periods**]{.underline}]{.mark} from 10 years
> (2006-2015) to 65 (1951-2015) years in length, [the [observed
> **temp**]{.mark}erature trend [lies in the]{.mark} **lower half**

> **[2.5th percentile]{.mark}** of all the model runs]{.underline}. Over
> shorter periods, such as the last two decades, a plethora of
> mechanisms have been put forth to explain the observed/modeled
> divergence, but none do so completely and many of the explanations are
> inconsistent with each other.

Similarly, climatologist John Christy of the University of Alabama in
Huntsville observes that [almost [all]{.mark} of the 102 climate
[models]{.mark}]{.underline} incorporated into the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) --- a tracking effort conducted by the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory --- [**[overstate]{.mark}** past
and current temperature [trends by a **factor of**]{.mark} **two to
[three]{.mark}**, and at times **even more**]{.underline}. It seems
axiomatic to say **[we should not rely on climate models]{.underline}**
that are unable to predict the past or the present to make predictions
about the distant future.

The overall temperature trend is not the only parameter the models
predict poorly. As an example, [every]{.underline} CMIP [climate model
predicts that increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gas
should create an enhanced heating effect in]{.underline} the
mid-troposphere [over the tropics]{.underline} --- that is, at an
altitude over the tropics of about 30,000-40,000 feet. The underlying
climatology is simple: Most of the tropics is ocean, and as increases in
greenhouse-gas concentrations warm the Earth slightly, there should be
an increase in the evaporation of ocean water in this region. When the
water vapor rises into the mid-troposphere, it condenses, releasing
heat. And [yet]{.underline} the [satellites cannot find this heating
effect --- a reality suggesting that our understanding of climate and
atmospheric phenomena is **not as robust** as many seem to
assume]{.underline}.

[The **[poor]{.mark} predictive [record]{.mark}** of mainstream climate
models [is **exacerbated** by]{.mark} the [tendency]{.mark} of the IPCC
and U.S. government agencies [to assume]{.mark} **highly
[unrealistic]{.mark} future [increases]{.mark}** in greenhouse-gas
concentrations]{.underline}. The IPCC's 2014 Fifth Assessment Report,
for example, uses four alternative "representative concentration
pathways" to outline scenarios of increased greenhouse-gas
concentrations yielding anthropogenic warming. These scenarios are known
as RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6, and RCP8.5. Since 1950, the average annual
increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations has been about 1.6 parts per
million. The average annual increase from 1985 to 2019 was about 1.9
parts per million, and from 2000 to 2019, it was about 2.2 parts per
million. The largest increase that occurred was about 3.4 parts per
million in 2016. But the assumed average annual increases in
greenhouse-gas concentrations through 2100 under the four RCPs are 1.1,
3.0, 5.5, and an astounding 11.9 parts per million, respectively.

The studies generating the most alarmist predictions are the IPCC's
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C and the U.S. government's
Fourth National Climate Assessment, both of which were published in
2018. Both assume RCP8.5 as the scenario most relevant for policy
planning. [The [average]{.mark}]{.underline} annual
**[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse-**[g]{.underline}**as
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} under RCP8.5 [[is]{.mark} over [five
times]{.mark} the [annual]{.mark} average]{.underline} for 2000-2019
[and almost four times the single biggest increase on
record]{.underline}. Climatologist Judith Curry, formerly of the Georgia
Institute of Technology, describes such a scenario as **[["borderline
impossible."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

RCP6 is certainly more realistic. It predicts a temperature increase of
3 degrees Celsius by 2100 in the average of the CMIP models. But on
average, those CMIP models overstate the documented temperature record
by a factor of at least two. [Ultimately, models with a **poor record**
of successfully accounting for past data and **highly unrealistic**
future greenhouse-gas concentrations should **not be considered a
reasonable basis** for future policy formulation]{.underline}.

**No climate impact\-\--[bad studies]{.underline} and
[adaption]{.underline}.**

The most extreme contrarian position is, of course, to deny one or both
key conclusions of the IPCC: the reality of global warming or the human
contribution to it. However, most [environmental
**optimists**]{.underline} accept these two key conclusions but
[[raise]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[problem]{.mark}s [with]{.mark}
the]{.underline} panel's [discussion of]{.underline} the social
[**effects of climate** **change** and]{.underline} even [more so
with]{.underline} **[[popular interp]{.mark}retations]{.underline}** of
the panel reports. For instance, Hausfather & Peters (2020), by no means
'climate deniers', [decry the **common** use [of]{.mark} choosing [the
**high-risk**]{.mark} **[\[scenario\]]{.mark}**]{.underline} RCP8.59 [to
illustrate **'business [as usual']{.mark}** [as
**misleading**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [[causal chain]{.mark}s from climate change to]{.underline} the
[**proposed** effects on human beings [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[long]{.mark}** and **complex**, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[uncertain]{.mark}ty increases every step** of the way]{.underline}.
[In the literature]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the social [effects of
climate change, including]{.underline} the [**IPCC [reports]{.mark}**,
**statements** abound]{.underline} that [something **'may' lead** to
something else, or]{.underline} that [a variable **'is sensitive to'
another**, [without]{.mark}]{.underline} any [[guidelines]{.mark} for
[how to **translate**]{.mark} this [into
**probabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gleditsch & Nordås, 2014: 87f).
[Uncritical use of the **[precautionary principle]{.mark}**, where
**a**]{.underline}ny [**remotely** possible]{.underline} [calamity
unwittingly becomes]{.underline} a [probable]{.underline} event, **[[is
not helpful]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Gleditsch & Nordås]{.underline} (2014: 85) note that while AR5 (IPCC,
2014) [did **[no]{.mark}**t find [**strong evidence** for]{.mark} a
[**direct** link between climate]{.mark} change [and
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, it **[argue]{.underline}**d that
[climate]{.underline} [change]{.underline} is likely to
[impact]{.underline} known **[conflict-inducing factors]{.underline}**
like poverty and inconsistent political institutions and therefore might
have an indirect effect on conflict. But [this]{.underline}
[[assumes]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[correlations are
**transitive**]{.mark}, which is not generally the case]{.underline}.
[If **A correlates with B** and **B with C**, we know nothing about how
**A relates to C** unless]{.underline} [**both**
correlations]{.underline} [are **extremely high**]{.underline}. The
strongest case for the climate--conflict link is the effect of
interaction between climate change and factors like poverty, state
failure, or ethnic polarization. It may be more cost-effective to try to
deal with these other risk factors than with global warming itself if
the goal is to reduce the 'risk multiplier' effect of climate change on
armed conflict.

The articles in this special issue do not generally see scarcity by
itself as necessarily resulting in strongly negative outcomes. Factors
like development, state failure, and previous overload on ecosystems
continue to play an important role in that they interact with climate
change to produce conflict and other social outcomes. For instance, Ide,
Kristensen & Bartusevicˆius (2021) conclude that the impact of floods on
political conflict are contingent on other factors such as population
size and regime type. Moreover, most of the articles do not assume that
scarcities are likely to arise at the global level. They may be regional
(mostly in Africa), national, or local. Urban and rural areas may be
affected by different scarcities. Climate change may also affect
particularly strongly groups that are already at an economic or
political disadvantage. The effects can be alleviated and adaptations
constructed at these levels.

The [argument]{.underline} about [how climate change]{.underline} may
[indirectly impact **conflict** leans heavily on]{.underline} the
[**negative economic consequences** of climate change]{.underline}, but
[with little or **no reference** to]{.underline} the [research
that]{.underline} explicitly [deals with this topic]{.underline}. In
fact, the relevant chapter in AR5 concluded that for most sectors of the
economy, the impact of climate change was likely to be dwarfed by other
factors. Tol (2018) finds that the long-term global economic effects are
likely to be negative, but that a [century of climate change will
have]{.underline} about [the]{.underline} [**same impact** on the
economy as the **loss of one year** of economic growth]{.underline}.
Other economists are more cautious, but the dean of climate change
economics, William Nordhaus (2018: 345, 359), estimates that 'damages
are 2.1 percent of global income at 3C warming and 8.5 percent of income
at 6C', while also warning that the longer the delay in taking decisive
action, the harsher the necessary countermeasures. Stern (2006) is more
pessimistic, based mainly on a lower discount rate (the interest rate
used to calculate the present value of future cash flows) as are Wagner
& Weitzman (2015). Heal (2017) argues that the Integrated Assessment
[[Models]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [used in the]{.underline}
[**assessment** of]{.underline} the [economics of climate change [are
**not accurate**]{.mark} **enough** [to]{.mark}
[provide]{.mark}]{.underline} [**quantitative insights**
and]{.underline} should [not be taken as [**serious**
forecasts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, all these economists take the
basically optimistic view that climate change is manageable with
appropriate policies for raising the price on the emission of greenhouse
gases. With a chapter heading from Wagner & Weitzman (2015: 17): 'We can
do this'.

This more optimistic assessment of climate change does not assume that
the challenge will go away by itself or can be left to the market. A
plausible approach, favored by most economists,10 is the imposition of a
robust and increasing price on carbon emissions (whether as a carbon tax
or through a cap and trade scheme) high enough to reduce the use of
fossil fuels and encourage the search for their replacement. More than
25 countries had such taxes by early 2018 (Metcalf, 2019), but generally
not at a level seen as necessary for limiting global warming to, say,
2C. This approach relies on the use of the market mechanism, but with
targets fixed by public policy. Income from a carbon tax can be
channeled back to the citizens to avoid increasing overall taxation. To
speed up the transition, funds can also be allocated to the research and
development of cheaper and more efficient production of various forms of
fossil-free energy, including nuclear power (Goldstein & Qvist, 2019).

The response of the [environmental optimists]{.underline} continues to
[emphasize the role of]{.underline}
**[[innovation]{.mark}s]{.underline}**; technological innovations,
[[such as]{.mark} **improvements in battery
[tech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}, the key element in the 2019 Nobel
Prize in chemistry,11 [but [also]{.mark}]{.underline} [[social]{.mark}
innovations]{.underline}, as [exemplified by the **experimental**
**approach** to the alleviation of **poverty**]{.underline}, rewarded in
the same year by the Nobel Prize in economics.12

While the most important countermeasures will be directed at the
mitigation of climate change, [there is]{.underline} also [a
[strong]{.mark} case for **[adaptation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If
sea-level rise cannot be totally prevented, [dikes and flood barriers
will [be]{.mark} **[cost-effective]{.mark}** and
**necessary**]{.underline}, at least in high-value urban areas. If parts
of Africa suffer from drought, [there will be increased use for **[new
crops]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are [**more suitable** for a **dry**
climate]{.underline}, possibly [developed in part by **GMO
technology**]{.underline}. **[[Industrialization]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in Africa can [[decrease]{.mark} the **one-sided [reliance]{.mark}** on
rain-fed]{.underline} [agriculture]{.underline}, as it has
[in]{.underline} other parts of [the world]{.underline}, which have
moved human resources from the primary sector to industry (and then to
services). Continuing [[urbanization]{.mark} will]{.underline}
[[move]{.mark} millions [out]{.mark} of the **most [vulnerable
communities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Collier, 2010). While structural
change failed to produce economic growth in Latin America and Africa
after 1990, Africa has experienced a turnaround in the new millennium
(McMillan & Rodrik, 2014) and [there are]{.underline} also [potentials
for [increasing **productivity** by **structural**]{.mark}
**[change]{.mark}** within agriculture]{.underline} in Africa
(McCullough, 2017).

The urgency (?) of CO2 emissions reductions

In the decades since the 1992 UNFCCC Treaty, global CO2 emissions have
continued to increase, especially in developing countries. In 2010, the
world's governments agreed that emissions need to be reduced so that
global temperature increases are limited to below 2 degrees Celsius.17
The target of 2oC (and increasingly 1.5oC)18 remains the focal point of
international climate agreements and negotiations.

[The original rationale for the 2^o^C target is the idea that
'**[tipping points]{.mark}**]{.underline}[']{.mark} − abrupt or
nonlinear transition to a different climate state − [become likely to
occur once this threshold has been crossed]{.underline}, with
consequences that are largely uncontrollable and beyond our management.
The IPCC AR5 considered a number of potential tipping points,
[[including ice sheet collapse, collapse of]{.mark} the
[Atlantic]{.mark} overturning [circulation]{.mark}, and
[permafrost]{.mark} carbon [release]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Every single
catastrophic scenario considered by the IPCC]{.underline} AR5 (WGII,
Table 12.4) [[has a rating of]{.underline}]{.mark} **[very
unlikely]{.underline}** [or **[exceptionally
unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and/or has]{.underline} [**low
confidence**. The only tipping point that the IPCC considers
likely]{.underline} in the 21st century [is disappearance of Arctic
**summer** sea ice (which is fairly]{.underline}
**[reversible]{.underline}**, [since **sea ice freezes every
winter**]{.underline}).

[In the **absence of tipping points** on the timescale of the 21st
century, the 2oC limit iss more usefully considered by analogy to a
highway speed limit]{.underline}:19 driving at 10 mph under the speed
limit is not automatically safe, and exceeding the limit by 10 mph is
not automatically dangerous, although the faster one travels the greater
the danger from an accident. Analogously, [the [2^o^]{.mark}C (or 1.5oC)
limit [should **not be taken literally**]{.mark} **as a real danger
threshold**]{.underline}. An analogy for considering the urgency of
emissions reductions is your 401K account: if you begin making
contributions early, it will be easier to meet your retirement goals.

[Nevertheless, the]{.underline} 2oC and 1.5oC [limits are used to
motivate the urgency of action to reduce CO2 emissions]{.underline}. At
a recent UN Climate Summit, (former) Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
warned that: "Without significant cuts in emissions by all countries,
and in key sectors, the window of opportunity to stay within less than 2
degrees \[of warming\] will soon close forever."20 Actually, [this
window of opportunity may remain open for quite some time. [The]{.mark}
implications of the **lower [value]{.mark}s [of climate
sensitivity]{.mark}**]{.underline} found by Lewis and Curry21 and other
recent studies [is that human caused warming is not [expected]{.mark} to
exceed the 2oC 'danger' level [in the]{.mark} 21st century]{.underline}.
Further, [there is growing evidence that the [RCP8.5 scenario]{.mark}
for future greenhouse gas concentrations, which drives the largest
amount of warming in climate model simulations, [is **impossibly
high**]{.mark}, requiring a combination of numerous borderline
**impossible socioeconomic scenarios**]{.underline}.22 [[A **slower
rate** ]{.mark}**of warming**]{.underline} [[means]{.mark} there is
**less urgency**]{.underline} [to phase out greenhouse gas emissions
now, and **[more time]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} find ways
to]{.underline} **[[decarbonize]{.mark} the economy
[affordably]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and with a minimum of]{.underline}
**[unintended consequences]{.underline}**. [It also allows for the
**flexibility to revise our policies**]{.underline} [as further
information becomes available]{.underline}.

[Is it possible that something truly dangerous and unforeseen could
happen]{.underline} to Earth's climate [during the 21st century? Yes it
is possible, but **[natural]{.mark} climate
[variability]{.mark}**]{.underline} (including geologic processes) [[may
be a more likely source of]{.mark} possible undesirable [change than
manmade warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. In any event, [attempting to avoid
such a dangerous and unforeseen climate by reducing fossil fuel
emissions will be]{.underline} **[futile]{.underline}** [if natural
climate and geologic processes are dominant factors]{.underline}.
Geologic processes are an important factor in the potential instability
of the West Antarctic ice sheet that could contribute to substantial sea
level rise in the 21st century.23

[[Under]{.mark} the [Paris]{.mark} Agreement, individual countries have
submitted]{.underline} to the UNFCCC their Nationally Determined
Contributions ([NDCs]{.underline}). Under the Obama Administration, the
U.S. NDC had a goal of reducing emissions by 28% below 2005 levels by
2025. Apart from considerations of feasibility and cost, it has been
estimated24 using the EPA MAGICC model that this commitment will prevent
0.03oC in warming by 2100. [When combined with current commitments from
other nations,]{.underline} **[only [a small fraction]{.mark} of the
projected future warming [will be ameliorated]{.mark} by these
commitments]{.underline}**. If climate models are indeed running too
hot,25 then the amount of warming prevented would be even smaller.
[[Even if emissions]{.mark} immediately [went to zero]{.mark} and the
projections of climate models are to be believed, [the impact]{.mark} on
the climate [would **not**]{.mark} **be [noticeable]{.mark}** [until the
2nd half of the]{.mark} 21st [century]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most of the
expected benefits to the climate from the UNFCCC emissions reductions
policy will be realized in the 22nd century and beyond.

[Attempting to use carbon dioxide as a control knob to regulate
climate]{.underline} on decadal to century timescales [is]{.underline}
arguably **[futile]{.underline}**. The UNFCCC [emissions reductions
policies have brought us to a point between a rock and a hard place,
whereby the emissions reduction policy with its **extensive costs** and
questions of feasibility are **inadequate for making a meaningful
dent**]{.underline} [in slowing down the expected warming]{.underline}
in the 21st century. [And the **real societal consequences** of climate
change and extreme weather events]{.underline} (whether caused by
manmade climate change or natural variability) **[remain largely
unaddressed]{.underline}**.

This is not to say that a transition away from burning fossil fuels
doesn't make sense over the course of the 21st century. People prefer
'clean' over 'dirty' energy -- provided that all other things are equal,
such as reliability, security, and economy. However, [assuming that
current wind and solar technologies are adequate for providing the
required amount and density of electric power for an advanced economy is
misguided]{.underline}.26

The recent record-breaking cold outbreak in the Midwest is a stark
reminder of the challenges of providing a reliable power supply in the
face of extreme weather events, where an inadequate power supply not
only harms the economy, but jeopardizes lives and public safety. Last
week, central Minnesota experienced a natural gas 'brownout,' as Xcel
Energy advised customers to turn thermostats down to 60 degrees and
avoid using hot water.27 Why? Because the wind wasn't blowing during an
exceptionally cold period. Utilities pair natural gas plants with wind
farms, where the gas plants can be ramped up and down quickly when the
wind isn't blowing. With bitter cold temperatures and no wind, there
wasn't enough natural gas.

[A [transition to]{.mark} an electric power system driven solely by
[wind and solar would require]{.mark} a **[massive]{.mark} amount of
[energy storage]{.mark}**. While energy storage technologies are
advancing, massive deployment of **cost-effective energy
storage**]{.underline} [technologies is well [beyond current
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}.28 [[An unintended consequence]{.mark}
of rapid deployment of wind and solar energy farms [may be]{.mark}
that]{.underline} **[[natural gas]{.mark} power [plants become]{.mark}
increasingly [entrenched]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the power supply
system]{.underline}.

Apart from energy policy, [there are a number of land use practices
related to croplands, grazing lands, forests and wetlands that could
increase the **natural sequestration**]{.underline} [of carbon and have
ancillary economic and ecosystem benefits]{.underline}.29 [These
co-benefits include **improved biodiversity**, **soil quality**,
**agricultural productivity** and wildfire behavior
modification.]{.underline}

In evaluating the urgency of CO2 emissions reductions, [we need to be
realistic]{.underline} about what reducing emissions will actually
accomplish. [Drastic reductions of emissions in the U.S. will not reduce
global CO2 concentrations if [emissions in the **developing
world**]{.mark}, particularly [**China** and **India**, continue to
increase]{.mark}.]{.underline} If we believe the climate model
simulations, [we would not expect to see any changes in extreme
weather/climate events until late in the 21st century]{.underline}. The
greatest impacts will be felt in the 22nd century and beyond, in terms
of reducing sea level rise and ocean acidification.

Resilience, anti-fragility and thrivability

Given that emissions reductions policies are very costly, politically
contentious and are not expected to change the climate in a meaningful
way in the 21st century, [**[adaptation strategies]{.underline}** [are
receiving]{.underline} ]{.mark}**[increasing
[attention]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in formulating responses]{.underline}
to climate change.

The extreme damages from recent hurricanes plus the recent billion
dollar disasters from floods, droughts and wildfires, emphasize that the
U.S. is highly vulnerable to current weather and climate disasters. Even
worse disasters were encountered in the U.S. during the 1930's and
1950's. Possible scenarios of incremental worsening of weather and
climate extremes over the course of the 21st century don't change the
fundamental storyline that many regions of the U.S. are not well adapted
to the current weather and climate variability, let alone the range that
has been experienced over the past two centuries.

As a practical matter, [adaptation has been driven by local crises
associated with extreme weather and climate]{.underline} events,
emphasizing the role of 'surprises' in shaping responses.
[[Advocates]{.mark} of adaptation to climate change]{.underline} are not
arguing for simply responding to events and changes after they occur;
they [are [arguing for **anticipatory adaptation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, in adapting to climate change, we need to acknowledge that we
cannot know how the climate will evolve in the 21st century, we are
certain to be surprised and we will make mistakes along the way.

'Resilience' is the ability to 'bounce back' in the face of unexpected
events. Resilience carries a connotation of returning to the original
state as quickly as possible. The difference in impact and recovery from
Hurricane Sandy striking New York City in 2012 versus the impact of
Tropical Cyclone Nargis striking Myanmar in 200830 reflects very
different vulnerabilities and capacities for bouncing back.

To increase our resilience to extreme weather and climate events, we can
'bounce forward' to reduce future vulnerability by evolving our
infrastructures, institutions and practices. Nicholas Taleb's concept of
antifragility31 focuses on learning from adversity, and developing
approaches that enable us to thrive from high levels of volatility,
particularly unexpected extreme events. Anti-fragility goes beyond
'bouncing back' to becoming even better as a result of encountering and
overcoming challenges. Anti-fragile systems are dynamic rather than
static, thriving and growing in new directions rather than simply
maintaining the status quo.

Strategies to increase antifragility include: economic development,
reducing the downside from volatility, developing a range of options,
tinkering with small experiments, and developing and testing
transformative ideas. Antifragility is consistent with decentralized
models of policy innovation that create flexibility and redundance in
the face of volatility. This 'innovation dividend' is analogous to
biodiversity in the natural world, enhancing resilience in the face of
future shocks.32

Similar to anti-fragility, the concept of 'thrivability' has been
articulated by Jean Russell:33 "It isn't enough to repair the damage our
progress has brought. It is also not enough to manage our risks and be
more shock-resistant. Now is not only the time to course correct and be
more resilient. It is a time to imagine what we can generate for the
world. Not only can we work to minimize our footprint but we can also
create positive handprints. It is time to strive for a world that
thrives."

A focus on policies that support resilience, anti-fragility and
thrivability avoids the hubris of thinking we can predict the future
climate. The relevant questions then become:

• How can we best promote the development of transformative ideas and
technologies?

• How much resilience can we afford?

The threats from climate change (whether natural or human caused) are
fundamentally regional, associated not only with regional changes to the
weather/climate, but with local vulnerabilities and cultural values and
perceptions. In the least developed countries, energy poverty and
survivability is of overwhelming concern, where there are severe
challenges to meeting basic needs and their idea of clean energy is
something other than burning dung inside their dwelling for cooking and
heating. In many less developed countries, particularly in South Asia,
an overwhelming concern is vulnerability to extreme weather events such
as floods and hurricanes that can set back the local economies for a
generation. In the developed world, countries are relatively less
vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events and have the
luxury of experimenting with new ideas: entrepreneurs not only want to
make money, but also to strive for greatness and transform the
infrastructure for society.

Extreme weather/climate events such as landfalling major hurricanes,
floods, extreme heat waves and droughts become catastrophes through a
combination of large populations, large and exposed infrastructure in
vulnerable locations, and human modification of natural systems that can
provide a natural safety barrier (e.g. deforestation, draining
wetlands). [[Addressing]{.mark} current adaptive [deficits and

Ways forward

Climate scientists have made a forceful argument for a future threat
from manmade climate change. [Based upon our current assessment of the
science, **[the threat does not seem]{.mark} to be an
[existential]{.mark} one**]{.underline} on the time scale of the 21st
century, [even in its most alarming incarnation]{.underline}. However,
[the perception of manmade climate change as a near-term
apocalypse]{.underline} and alignment with range of other social
objectives [has **narrowed the policy options that we're willing to
consider**]{.underline}.

Global [warming activists argue carbon-dioxide emissions are destroying
the planet, but the [climate impacts]{.mark} of carbon dioxide [are
**minimal, at worst**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Activists would also have
you believe fossil-fuel emissions have driven carbon-dioxide
concentrations to their highest levels in history. The Obama-era
Environmental Protection Agency went so far as to classify carbon
dioxide as a toxic pollutant, and it established a radical goal of
closing all of America's coal-fired power plants.

[Claims of unprecedented]{.underline} carbon-dioxide [levels ignore most
of Earth's 4.6-billion-year history. Relative to Earth's entire record,
carbon-dioxide [levels are at **historic**]{.mark}**ally [low]{.mark}**
levels; they only appear high when compared to the dangerously low
levels of carbon dioxide that occurred in Earth's very recent history.
The geologic record reveals [carbon]{.mark} dioxide [has **almost
always** been in]{.mark} Earths' atmosphere in much [greater
concentrations]{.mark} than it is today. For example, [600 million years
ago]{.mark}, when history's greatest birth of new animal species
occurred]{.underline}, atmospheric carbon-dioxide [concentrations
exceeded 6,500]{.underline} parts per million [(ppm) --- an amount
that's [**17 times** greater]{.mark} than it is today]{.underline}.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is currently only 410 parts per million. That
means only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere is carbon dioxide (compared to
0.03 percent one century ago). Only one molecule in 2,500 is carbon
dioxide. Such levels certainly do not pose a health risk, as
carbon-dioxide levels in our naval submarines, which stay submerged for
months at a time, contain an average carbon-dioxide concentration of
5,000 ppm.

The geologic record is important because it reveals relationships
between carbon-dioxide levels, climate, and life on Earth. [Over
billions of years, the [geologic record shows]{.mark} there is
**[no]{.mark} long-term [correlation]{.mark}** [between]{.mark}
atmospheric [carbon]{.mark}-dioxide levels [and]{.mark} Earth's
[climate. There are periods]{.mark} in Earth's history [when]{.mark}
carbon dioxide [concentrations were **many times** higher]{.mark} than
they are today, [yet temperatures]{.mark} were identical to, or **even
[colder]{.mark}** than, modern times. [The claim]{.mark} that
fossil-fuel [emissions control]{.mark} atmospheric
[carbon]{.mark}-dioxide concentrations [is]{.mark} also [**invalid**,
as]{.mark} atmospheric [concentrations]{.mark} have [gone up]{.mark} and
down in the geological record, [**even without** human
influence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The absurdity of climate alarmism claims gets even stranger when you
consider there are 7.5 billion people on our planet who, together,
exhale 2.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year, which is almost 10
percent of total fossil-fuel emissions every year. However, we are but a
single species. Combined, people and all domesticated animals contribute
10 billion tons.

Further, [9 percent of carbon-dioxide emissions from all living things
arise not from animals, but from anaerobic bacteria and
fungi]{.underline}. These organisms metabolize dead plant and animal
matter in soil via decay processes that recycle carbon dioxide back into
the atmosphere. The grand total produced by all living things is
estimated to be 440 billion tons per year, or 13 times the amount of
carbon dioxide currently being produced by fossil-fuel emissions.
[[Fossil-fuel]{.mark} emissions [are **less than 10 percent** of]{.mark}
biological [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Are you laughing yet?

[Every [apocalyptic pronouncement]{.mark} you hear or read [is
**\[totally wrong\]**]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~nothing short of
insanity~~. Their primary goal is not to save plants, humans, or
animals, but rather to use climate "dangers" as a justification for
centralizing power in the hands of a select few.

**Even [extreme]{.underline} warming won't cause extinction**

Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity, Hachette Books,

But the purpose of this chapter is finding and assessing threats that
pose a direct existential risk to humanity. [[Even
at]{.underline}]{.mark} such **[[extreme levels]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of warming, [it is difficult to see exactly how climate change could do
so]{.underline}. Major [effects]{.underline} of climate change [include
reduced **ag**]{.underline}ricultural [yields, sea level rises, water
scarcity, increased]{.underline} tropical [diseases, ocean acidification
and]{.underline} the [collapse of the Gulf Stream]{.underline}. While
extremely important when assessing the overall risks of climate change,
**[[none]{.underline}]{.mark}** of these **[[threaten
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** or irrevocable collapse.

[[Crops are]{.underline}]{.mark} very sensitive to reductions in
temperature (due to frosts), but [[less sensitive]{.mark} to
increases]{.underline}. By all appearances [[we would]{.mark} **still
[have food]{.mark}**]{.underline} to support civilization.85 [[Even if
sea levels rose **hundreds of meters**]{.underline}]{.mark} (over
centuries), [**[most]{.mark}** of the Earth's [land]{.mark} area would
[remain]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, while some areas might
conceivably become uninhabitable due to water scarcity, other areas will
have increased rainfall. [More]{.underline} areas [may become
susceptible to tropical diseases, but]{.underline} we need only [look to
the tropics to see civilization **flourish**]{.underline} despite this.
The main effect of a collapse of the system of Atlantic Ocean currents
that includes the Gulf Stream is a 2°C cooling of Europe---something
that poses no permanent threat to global civilization.

From an existential risk perspective, [a]{.underline} more serious
[concern is that the high temperatures]{.underline} (and the rapidity of
their change) [might cause a large loss of biodiversity and subsequent
ecosystem collapse]{.underline}. While the pathway is not entirely
clear, a large enough collapse of ecosystems across the globe could
perhaps threaten human extinction. The idea that climate change could
cause widespread extinctions has some good theoretical support.86 [Yet
the evidence is **mixed**. For when we look at many of the [**past
cases** of]{.mark} extremely [high]{.mark} global
**[temp]{.mark}**erature**[s]{.mark}** or extremely rapid warming we
[**don't see** a]{.mark} corresponding [loss of
**biod**]{.mark}iversity]{.underline}.87

\[FOOTNOTE\]

[We don't see such biodiversity loss in the **12°C warmer climate** [of
the]{.mark} **early [Eocene]{.mark}**[, nor]{.mark} the rapid global
change of the **[PETM]{.mark}**, nor in rapid **regional** changes of
climate]{.underline}. Willis et al. (2010) state: "We argue that
although the underlying mechanisms responsible for these past changes in
climate were very different (i.e. natural processes rather than
anthropogenic), [the rates and magnitude of climate change are similar
to those predicted for the future and therefore potentially **relevant**
to understanding future biotic response. What emerges from these past
records is evidence for **rapid community turnover**, **migrations**,
**development** of novel ecosystems and thresholds from one stable
ecosystem state to another, but [there is **very little
ev**]{.mark}**idence** [for **broad**]{.mark}**-scale
[extinctions]{.mark}** [due to]{.mark} a [warming]{.mark} world." There
are similar conclusions in **Botkin**]{.underline} et al. (2007),
**[Dawson]{.underline}** et al. (2011), **[Hof]{.underline}** et al.
(2011) [and **Willis & MacDonald**]{.underline} (2011). The best
evidence of warming causing extinction may be from the end-Permian mass
extinction, which may have been associated with large-scale warming (see
note 91 to this chapter).

\[END FOOTNOTE\]

So [the [most important]{.mark} known effect of climate change from the
perspective of direct existential risk [is]{.mark}]{.underline} probably
the most obvious: **[[heat stress]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We need an
environment cooler than our body temperature to be able to rid ourselves
of waste heat and stay alive. More precisely, we need to be able to lose
heat by sweating, which depends on the humidity as well as the
temperature.

A landmark paper by Steven Sherwood and Matthew Huber showed that with
sufficient warming there would be parts of the world whose temperature
and humidity combine to exceed the level where humans could survive
without air conditioning.88 With 12°C of warming, a very large land
area---where more than half of all people currently live and where much
of our food is grown---would exceed this level at some point during a
typical year. Sherwood and Huber suggest that such areas would be
uninhabitable. This may not quite be true (particularly if air
conditioning is possible during the hottest months), but their
habitability is at least in question.

[[However, **substantial regions**]{.mark} would also **[remain
below]{.mark}** this threshold. **[Even with]{.mark} an extreme
[20°C]{.mark} of [warming]{.mark}** there would be [**many** coastal
areas (and]{.mark} some **[elevated regions]{.mark}**) that would have
no days above the temperature/humidity threshold]{.underline}.89 [So
there would [remain]{.mark} **large areas** in which humanity and
**[civ]{.mark}**ilization [could **continue**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
world with 20°C of warming would be an unparalleled human and
environmental tragedy, forcing mass migration and perhaps starvation
too. This is reason enough to do our utmost to prevent anything like
that from ever happening. However, our present task is identifying
existential risks to humanity and [it is hard to see how any realistic
level of heat stress could pose such a risk]{.underline}. So the runaway
and moist greenhouse effects remain the only known mechanisms through
which climate change could directly cause our extinction or irrevocable
collapse.

This doesn't rule out unknown mechanisms. We are considering large
changes to the Earth that may even be unprecedented in size or speed. It
wouldn't be astonishing if that directly led to our permanent ruin. The
best argument against such unknown mechanisms is probably that the PETM
did not lead to a mass extinction, despite temperatures rapidly rising
about 5°C, to reach a level 14°C above pre-industrial temperatures.90
But this is tempered by the imprecision of paleoclimate data, the
sparsity of the fossil record, the smaller size of mammals at the time
(making them more heat-tolerant), and a reluctance to rely on a single
example. Most importantly, anthropogenic warming could be over a hundred
times faster than warming during the PETM, and rapid warming has been
suggested as a contributing factor in the end-Permian mass extinction,
in which 96 percent of species went extinct.91 In the end, we can say
little more than that [direct [existential risk from climate]{.mark}
change [appears **very small**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but cannot yet be
ruled out.

Rogue Actors

The calculus of cyberwar should also take the possibility of rogue
actors into account.

For many forms of warfare, worries about rogue actors -- individuals or
groups that make war without authorization -- are theoretical threats,
suitable for Hollywood (e.g., Dr. Strangelove), but of little practical
moment. War is a dangerous business, the risk of being caught is
nontrivial, and isolated units (e.g., an unsupported fighter squadron)
are generally ineffective against states.

Militias may be an exception, particularly those that prey on unarmed
populations. The dangers are low, the risk of getting caught is modest,
and they can be militarily effective operating in guerilla mode. The
possibility of militias is a constant worry in states where policing is
corrupt or ineffective; they can start fights and make it very difficult
to conclude them.

Cyberspace may have considerable scope for militias. The direct risks of
combat to combatants are zero (in the usual case that physical proximity
is not necessary). The risks of getting caught are small if such groups
and their systems practice operational security. Finally, cyberattacks
can do damage against countries that have not fully secured their own
systems. In contrast to militias, they can have global effects, and, if
the hackers are particularly skillful or lucky (e.g., by finding an
exploitable vulnerability in a critical system) they can have serious
ones. Although states continue to have advantages over nonstate actors
in employing hackers (and states with ample resources can usually outdo
states without resources), it does not take a particularly large team to
generate effects, as long as the members of this team are sufficiently
talented. Because the work of cyberwar is closely aligned to nations'
intelligence communities (the vast majority of system penetrations by
governments are to collect information not bring such systems down),
they arise from a culture that prizes and usually practices secrecy.
Intelligence agencies that pursue courses (seemingly) antithetical to
declared state policies do occur: Pakistan's ISI is a case in
point.\[7\]

Attacks by rogue operators create a path to conflict that carry a far
lower risk to itself than would be the case if the only option were
kinetic warfare. Indeed, there are good reasons to believe that if, say,
Russia wanted to convey its ire at one or another U.S. action, then it
could convince itself that the risks to its own well-being were low if
it simply empowered its mafiya to carry out such attacks on the state's
behalf, perhaps in return for winking at other mafiya activities taking
place within Russia itself. The relationship between the state and
hackers in China is still unclear even after the Mandiant report.
Similar ambiguity exists with Iran. Perhaps attackers would believe that
risks are low because attribution is difficult. The argument that Russia
will be forced to assist the United States in catching the actual
attackers vies with the observation Russia denied Estonia's request for
assistance after the 2007 attack (or the previous attempt by the United
States to trace the origins of the 1998 intrusion into DoD computers
subsequently labeled Moonlight Maze\[8\]). Conversely, a target
country's attempts to trace responsibility for a cyberattack
consequential enough to risk escalation to the kinetic level may be
harder to turn aside. Faced with the decision of admitting that one of
its own carried out the attack outside official command-and-control, or
brazening through a crisis, the attacking country may well double down,
setting the stage for a confrontation.

Crisis

Military capabilities may also affect crisis dynamics in ways that
predispose countries to slide into or away from warfare. Even those
disinclined to believe that cyberwars alone are likely to be
consequential must admit that kinetic conflict can be consequential and
that cyberattack capabilities might affect the latter's onset or course.
Of note is that cyberwar capabilities may increase the likelihood of a
full-fledged kinetic conflict (as distinguished from a kinetic attack
discussed above) either by presenting opportunities for attackers or by
making defenders think that their opponents are creating such
opportunities.

Cyberattacks might be used to cripple conventional capabilities at the
outset of conflict giving the attacker a decisive, albeit fleeting,
opportunity to carry out a successful kinetic attack while its foe has
been blinded (by attacks on its ISR capabilities), confused (by attacks
on its command-and-control), or immobilized (by attacks on its logistics
and deployment system). The last may be the least consequential (if
forces are pre-equipped with a week's worth of supplies), but may also
be most accessible. If the U.S. military is a model, logistics systems
are much more likely to be connected to the Internet while the command
and control of military units is more likely to sit on air-gapped
networks; ISR systems as befits their intelligence origin, are even more
isolated.

The difficulty of attributing cyberattacks, and the near-impossibility
of seeing a well-executed cyberattack coming, coupled with the short
duration of their immediate effects make a bolt-from-the-blue in
cyberspace prefatory to kinetic war more insidious. First, attackers may
convince themselves that a bolt-from-the-blue is relatively riskless. If
such attacks shift the correlation of forces enough, the shooting starts
because the prospects of victory by the country that carries out the
cyberattack are that much brighter. If such attacks fail to do enough to
change the odds of victory, the attacker holds off on shooting, and the
target may not necessarily respond as if war had started -- or so the
cyber attacker may reason. Such reasoning is much less plausible if the
bolt from the blue were a kinetic attack whose provenance was much
harder to deny. Second, the well-founded presumption that the effects of
a cyberattack are likely to last only until such systems are restored to
where they are usable (hours to weeks?), means that the decision to
exploit the opening has to be made more quickly than if the damage were
permanent (as it might be if the bolt from the blue, for instance,
disabled satellites in orbit). Strong confirmation biases (thinking
fast\[9\]) may induce countries to capitalize on what they hope was
success, even when they might have held back given more time to consider
(thinking slow) what a rush to war might produce.

Instability may also arise from the defender's reaction to a possible
bolt from the blue. Granted, if the defender noticed that its military
systems had been crippled by a cyberattack, then responding with
alacrity is appropriate. But the possibility of a bolt-from-the-blue
suggests that in a crisis (as the victim of the cyberattack sees it) any
cyberattack may have to be treated as prefatory to a kinetic attack. The
target country may then turn up its warnings-and-indications sensors to
catch the minute ripplings of its foes on the match. Unfortunately, the
higher the gain, the greater the likelihood of reading artifacts as
though they were indicators -- and so off to war.\[10\]

Unfortunately, this scenario understates the problem. Both acts of
cyberwar and cyber-espionage canonically start with the penetration of
the target to insert malware. This malware then calls out for
instructions, which variously can instruct the infected machine to do
something damaging (cyberwar) or to send back information of a
particular type (cyber-espionage). Discovering the penetration,
particularly if it can be attributed to a potential adversary, may
convince the target country that it will soon face attack. It may then
turn up its indicator-and-warning sensors with the same violent result.

Either way, the possibility of a cyber bolt-from-the-blue coupled with
the difficulty of ascertaining who carried it out or even whether what
looks like preparations for one are, in fact, such preparations or just
apparitions adds the possibility of instability to crisis.

In all fairness, the wars that such cyberattacks might predispose would
have to be those where the outcome of the first few days fighting is
particularly decisive: a quick high-intensity conflict is ideal for such
treatment. The prospect for success in long wars or low-intensity
conflicts is scarcely affected by opening-day hijinks; logically
therefore the possibility of cyberwar should have little effect on
starting such conflicts.

Escalation

The assumption that cyberwar is a cool war also rests on the presumption
that what starts in cyberspace will stay in cyberspace; there will be no
escalation into kinetic conflict. Clearly the chance of escalation that
crosses domains is greater than zero, but for cyber war to lose its cool
status requires that the risks of escalation into kinetic conflict for a
cyberattack be substantially less than similar risks associated with a
comparable kinetic attack.

The thin history we have of cyberattacks does not suggest that a
cyberattack will necessarily be followed by much of anything at all. The
Russian\[11\] 2007 attacks on Estonia which crippled public and major
private web sites was followed by Estonia's complaints and NATO's
unwillingness to deem this an Article V attack (triggering collective
self-defense measures) but it led to nothing violent or even
close.\[12\] If Georgia had reacted kinetically to the cyberattacks on
it in 2008, it would have been difficult to distinguish such actions
from the war Georgia was forced to fight following its invasion by
Russian forces. The 2007 Israeli air strike on a purported nuclear
facility in Syria may have been facilitated by an opening cyberattack on
Syrian air defenses but Syria did not respond at all to the cyberattack
or the raid itself. Iran did not react kinetically to Stuxnet, even if
it created cyberwar cadres that may have been implicated in carrying out
denial-of-service attacks on banks\[13\] in the United States (from
whence, supposedly, Stuxnet), but also attacks which trashed computers
in Saudi Arabia (specifically, Aramco\[14\]) and Qatar (specifically,
RasGas\[15\]), neither of which could be plausibly accused of complicity
in creating Stuxnet. Similarly, the United States carried out no kinetic
attack in response to the aforementioned denial-of-service attacks on
banks that its intelligence community ascribed to Iran.

To be fair, cyberattacks unaccompanied by the outbreak of war are easier
to liken to a raid than a war. In a raid, forces cross borders, wreak
their mischief, and go home. In a war, they intend to stay permanently
or turn what they have taken (be it territory or the entire country)
over to those they deem their allies. It is very difficult of conceive
of a cyberattack that can change the head of state and even harder to
conceive of one that can conquer all or even part of another country. In
worst-case scenarios, a cyberattack can disrupt life and maybe even
break some machines. But they do not persist unless the cost of
eradicating them -- for instance, by doing a system reboot, or replacing
infected machines with uninfected machines -- exceeds the cost of
tolerating their presence. It is worth remembering that there is no
forced entry in cyberspace. Almost all wars tend to be two-side
engagements because the attacked side has no option but to fight or
surrender. In a raid, there is a third option to offer, at most, some
resistance but not pursue the attacker for fear of worse. Thus, not all
raids lead to counter-raids. The aforementioned 2007 Israeli raid on
Syria did not. The many U.S. drone strikes have not, so far. China
invaded Vietnam in 1979, wreaked damage, caused casualties, and departed
having, in its mind, taught Vietnam a lesson. Vietnam did not return the
favor by invading China. Neither did India in 1962 under similar
circumstances. Granted, some nations do respond. Arabs and Israelis
traded raids in the decade or so after Israel declared independence
(1948); Palestinians and Israelis traded attacks over the last three
decades, as well. Both Koreas sent raiding parties across the 38th
parallel in the years prior to North Korea's 1950 invasion. The history
of raids escalating into open conflict (as distinguished from raids
preceding open conflict as was the Korean case) is also thin.

Two other difficulties associated with attribution and the difficulties
of disarming the attacker are likely to reduce the pressure to
retaliate, much less, escalate in response to a cyberattack.
Difficulties of attribution are likely to have two related effects. The
first is that the target may not be so certain about who did it -- or at
least not be certain of its ability to convince third parties such as
other countries who did it -- to validate a response. The second is that
if it takes too much time to analyze the attack to the point where it
can determine (and make the case about) who did it with the requisite
confidence, the political pressure for vengeance may have cooled and the
politico-military situation that warranted retaliation may have changed
(e.g., yesterday's foe might be today's partner).

The impetus to respond can also be reduced if the public has little idea
about the identity of the attacker and even the fact of the attack
(e.g., the failure to function is not obvious to the outside). Until the
New York Times reported on Stuxnet, the public did not know that Iran
had been attacked (it is not clear whether anyone in Iran actually
understood that they were being attacked before it was reported). If no
one knows that two parties are trading blows in the dark, there is much
less requirement to appear strong as a way of establishing third-party
deterrence.

The difficulty of disarming the other side's cyberwar capabilities
removes another reason for responding to a cyberattack. A kinetic
response to a kinetic attack can be justified, not only as a way to
reinforce deterrence, but also as a way to reduce the attacker's ability
to carry out further attacks; it does so by killing opposing forces and
destroying military equipment, ancillary supplies and infrastructure,
especially staging areas. A cyber response can only be justified in
terms of deterrence because it is very difficult for a cyberattack to
permanently or even temporarily damage the other side's ability to carry
out cyberattacks, which require little more than hackers, information,
computing equipment, software, and network connections.\[16\] Granted,
the target country may conclude that it may win some relief from
cyberattack by carrying out a kinetic attack on the attacker's cyberwar
corps. Such actions cannot be ruled out\[17\] --- but suffice it to say
that at least the tools of a cyberattack cannot be identified from afar
in the same way that the tools of a kinetic attack can be.
Alternatively, the target can convince itself that the only way to rid
itself of the cyberattack menace is to change the regime that governs
the attacking country. If the sole aim of such logic is to minimize the
likelihood of future damage to the target country, it can be convincing
only by substantially underestimating the cost and risk of war or
substantially overestimating the inconvenience associated with adopting
other measures to improve cyber-security.

Finally, and in lieu of regime change, the escalation path from a
cyberattack into a kinetic response also crosses a threshold that does
not come up when the original provocation and the response were both
kinetic. It is unclear whether this threshold is more like a speed bump
or a yawning abyss, but it is clearly present. It should therefore seem
obvious that a cyberattack is less likely to result in a kinetic
response than an equivalent kinetic attack would have. However, this
raises the question of what constitutes equivalence. Assessing kinetic
damage when it is damage to you is a straightforward exercise. Assessing
the damage from a cyberattack that leads to the widespread corruption of
information systems requires knowing what systems have, in fact, been
corrupted (something that, ironically, the attacker may have a better
handle on). A target country that has been spooked by a cyberattack into
imagining that the real damage is a multiple of the visible damage may
well overreact (at least initially until it realizes over time which of
its systems is or is not behaving as if they had been corrupted).

In sum, although the risks of violent escalation following a cyberattack
are nonzero, the odds are against it, in isolation and particularly in
comparison to a kinetic attack of similar magnitude.

Conclusions

New ways of carrying out conflict would, intuitively, seem to increase
the likelihood of conflict. They create new ways to fight without
necessarily lessening existing ways. We can easily imagine two countries
carrying out cyberattacks on one another, when they would have had no
such option were cyberwar not a possibility. To the extent that the
reverberations of such a conflict escape beyond cyberspace they would
seem to increase the likelihood of violence. But that rule does not
always apply. Nuclear weapons, for instance, were not only not used
during the Cold War, they are credited with having reduced the odds of
conventional conflict in Europe. And cyberattacks, if they can
substitute for kinetic attacks, may also reduce the odds of violence.

Do they? Although it is too soon to tell for sure; logic suggests
otherwise. First, there are more ways in which countries, possessed of
cyberattack capabilities, would use them or use cyberattack-enhanced
conventional operations than there are ways in which cyberattacks would
substitute for kinetic attacks. Second, cyberattacks may be used by
rogue elements operating against distant countries in ways harder to
imagine with conventional warfare capabilities. Third, cyberattack
capabilities may exacerbate crises by creating the possibility of a
disabling strike, or because the preparations for such a strike are hard
to distinguish from cyber espionage. The saving grace is that the
escalation potential, particularly a kinetic response, following a
cyberattack, while nonzero, is suppressed by many factors.

cyberspace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [where there is more
sensitivity]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [less]{.underline}
[commonality]{.underline} to emerging national approaches than in more
established domains, and to MDO, which is inherently predicated on
integration and interoperability (Sharpy, 2020).

**[[Info]{.underline}]{.mark}**rmation **[[sharing]{.mark} is especially
[problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[for]{.underline} the
[cyber dimension]{.underline} of MDO, [with **[Allies reticent to share
details]{.mark}**]{.underline} of their [capabilities across NATO
[given]{.mark}]{.underline} [[security concerns]{.mark} and political
sensitivities]{.underline}. The issue of permissions is also a
'significant challenge in the development of cyber capabilities',
especially where reconnaissance on Allied soil and networks is required
to detect hostile cyber activity (Watling & Roper, 2019).
[Nations]{.underline} also [have differing policy]{.underline},
[legal]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [ethical stances]{.underline} on
key technologies on which MDO relies. This [**[includes]{.mark}** **the
[use of offensive cyber]{.mark} capabilities**]{.underline} or basing of
hypersonic missiles or longrange penetrating fires in Europe, which some
fear could be destabilising and escalatory (Quintin & Vanholme, 2020).
[NATO]{.underline} similarly [lacks]{.underline} a [common approach to
governance]{.underline} and use of AI, autonomy and automation, all
envisaged as essential enablers for JADC2 (Williams, 2020). This affects
the levels of autonomy (with the human in, on or out of the loop) used
for sensor data fusion and decision-making, or to deliver effects using
uncrewed platforms, automated cyber systems and human-machine teaming
(Scharre, 2018). 138 [In considering]{.underline} cooperation and
[burden-sharing, Allies face]{.underline} several [dilemmas depending
on]{.underline} their [ambitions and resources for]{.underline} both
[cyberspace]{.underline} and MDO. The US must overcome domestic
inter-service rivalries and decide how to integrate partners, including
whether it can accept a multinational vision of MDO that is not imposed
on smaller allies---or excludes them entirely, at NATO's expense---but
rather is genuinely collaborative (Watling & Roper, 2019). [[Larger
Europe]{.mark}an nations [face]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[dilemma
of]{.mark} whether to buy into a]{.underline} [US-led
architecture]{.underline} and system-of-systems [with **[implications
for freedom]{.mark} of action**]{.underline}, data-sharing and
procurement choices, [or]{.underline} [shoulder]{.underline} the [costs
of sovereign]{.underline} or multinational [alternatives]{.underline}.11
They also face choices over how best to contribute to multinational MDO:
whether to aspire to full-spectrum capabilities to allow sovereign
action and offer redundancy to Allies' capabilities or to specialise in
certain domains (e.g. cyber) to offer niche capability and buy leverage
with the US and NATO by making themselves indispensable. [Smaller
nations]{.underline} must decide how to influence larger Allies and
NATO, and what to do if they lack cyber capabilities (or others deemed
central to MDO, e.g. long-range fires) or their [forces are too small to
operate]{.underline} or gain MDO experience at echelons [above
brigade]{.underline} (Watling & Roper, 2019).

The [[economic]{.mark} [fallout]{.mark} of COVID-19]{.underline} also
[[raises]{.mark} **renewed [questions about
affordability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[extent to which Allies]{.mark} are [willing]{.mark} and able [to
invest]{.mark} in new cyber capabilities]{.underline}---though some may
see these as cost-efficient alternatives to land, air or maritime
forces---and how they time investments in ambitious transformation
programmes such as MDO (Clark, 2020). Timing presents both threats and
opportunities from a cyber perspective. [**[Rapid]{.mark}**, hasty

Conversely, overly cautious change risks ceding ground to adversaries
such as Russia and China which are investing heavily in asymmetric
means, including offensive cyber capabilities, to gain an information
advantage over NATO (Kilcullen, 2020).

Nevertheless, the [[largest barrier to]{.mark} a [joint cyber]{.mark}
capability]{.underline} [[is]{.underline} [national
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} agencies' [[tendency to
keep]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[activities]{.underline}]{.mark} in
cyberspace [highly [classified]{.mark}]{.underline}.182 As Chapter 2
discussed, [effective cyberattacks]{.underline} are utterly [dependent
on excellent intelligence]{.underline}.183 Members have significantly
stepped up intelligence-sharing over the last two decades. They
established the NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre in 2006, the Joint
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance initiative in 2012 and the
Joint Intelligence and Security Division (JISD) in 2017. The JISD's
first Assistant Secretary General, Arndt Freytag von Loringhoven, says
it has fostered a new culture of intelligence cooperation, increased
efficiency and has helped avoid the duplication 37 of effort.184
Notably, he claims this new fusion of intelligence has 'positioned the
JISD to contend effectively with the... cyber... threats increasingly
confronting NATO'.185

However, von Loringhoven's [optimism glosses]{.underline}
[over]{.underline} the **[great difficulty of intra-Alliance
intelligence sharing]{.underline}**. [[Divulging]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[secret]{.underline} [info]{.underline}]{.mark}[rmation is]{.underline}
a trade-off [between trusting a partner]{.underline} enough to share
information [that **[could]{.mark} [endanger one's
own]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[source]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[against]{.underline} the [benefits of doing]{.underline} so.186
Therefore, [[national agencies]{.mark} are **[reluctant to
share]{.mark}**]{.underline} it [with international
organisations]{.underline}, instead [**[preferring]{.underline}**
**[bilat]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[eral
[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[case-by-case]{.mark} [basis]{.mark}]{.underline}.187 It is shared
between states with closely aligned interests, mutual trust and good
diplomatic relations, as seen in the Anglo-American UKUSA Agreement.188
The exclusive 'Five Eyes' Alliance this evolved into is a rare example
of multilateral intelligence sharing, involving NATO members America,
Canada and the UK. These agreements tend to be more concerned with the
security of the intelligence shared rather than its content, due to
concerns over how other states will circulate the information. 189
Accordingly, [wider intelligence cooperation within NATO]{.underline}
would be much [harder to achieve]{.underline}, primarily
[because]{.underline} [many [states **do not share**]{.mark} **strong
levels of [trust]{.mark}**]{.underline}, common interests and diplomatic
relations [with each other]{.underline}. For instance, [France remains
unsympathetic]{.underline} [to intelligence integration]{.underline} in
any multilateral environment, [[preferring]{.mark} strategic
[autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}.190 This is compounded by an uneasy
relationship with the Alliance, with President Emmanuel Macron calling
it 'brain dead' in 2019.191 Furthermore, [some [allies fear]{.mark} that
[if]{.mark}]{.underline} [[countries]{.mark} with [lower resilience
are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[infiltrated]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[they
could]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [[compromise]{.underline}]{.mark}
[sensitive [info]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation [[shared]{.mark} between
members]{.underline}.192 Consequently, **[[apprehension about]{.mark}
[Italy's weak]{.mark} cyber [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}** [hinders
allies' propensity to share]{.underline} with Rome, since the
**[potential for leaks undermines their trust]{.underline}**.193

These [concerns have resulted in a **division between**]{.underline}
those **[member states]{.underline}** that possess more advanced
intelligence assets and those that do not. The former have been
resisting serious intelligence integration, while the latter --
including [[Belgium]{.mark} and]{.underline} The
[[Netherlands]{.underline}]{.mark} -- have even [[pressed for]{.mark} a
[CIA]{.mark}-[style]{.mark} European [agency]{.mark}]{.underline}.194 So
far, [NATO's more powerful members]{.underline} have successfully
**[repelled]{.underline}** such **[initiatives]{.underline}**. Following
the 2015 Paris terror attacks, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel
proclaimed the need for a 'European CIA'.195 Nonetheless,
[[German]{.underline}]{.mark} Interior [Minister]{.underline} Thomas de
Maizière [[shot]{.mark} this [proposal down]{.mark}]{.underline},
claiming that 'I [cannot imagine]{.underline} we will be [willing to
**give up our national sovereignty'**]{.underline}.196

Unsurprisingly, [[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} [own [collaborative
efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} to date have also been **[[heavily limited
by]{.mark} national agencies' [desire for secrecy]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and autonomy. Pushback against greater transparency is especially strong
on the part of the US, which owns a large share of NATO's intelligence
capabilities.197 not have access to all US intelligence, but NATO
releasable information only.198 Such secrecy is a big practical obstacle
to a joint offensive cyber capability. Although it is justified,
elevating America's role in Alliance cyber policy without increasing
transparency would likely limit the tactical and strategic effectiveness
of a combined offensive cyber capability.199 NATO's intelligence fusion
efforts have suffered from other, less important problems too.
[Different languages, cultures]{.underline} [and
infrastructures]{.underline} [have proved to be **structural
constraints**]{.underline}, while battlefield commanders have criticised
the intelligence provided for lacking the strategic dimension.200 For
instance, Lieutenant-General Mark Hertling judged NATO's information on
Islamic State too narrow and target-oriented, thus missing the bigger
picture.201

Overall, the [establishment of a joint capability]{.underline} would
[face]{.underline} some [serious practical problems]{.underline}, [both
when confronting NATO's internal politics and]{.underline} [national
intelligence agencies']{.underline} clandestine modus operandi. [There
would be significant legal hurdles]{.underline} [to overcome
too]{.underline}, which Chapter 4 discusses in more detail.

Assuming NATO can overcome conceptual and policy hurdles, significant
effort will still be required to develop the necessary forces and
capabilities across all domains, but perhaps especially for cyberspace.

Operationalising MDO demands a 'calibrated force posture' with
multi-domain formations strategically positioned, held at readiness and
able to deploy over large distances, trained and equipped to operate
across multiple contested domains (Grispen-Gelens, 2020). The vision is
for different sensors and shooters to share and fuse data, build a
common operating picture, inform rapid decision-making and deliver
effects at a time and place of the commander's choosing and to do so
agnostic of domains, nation, service or platform (Niewood, Grant &
Lewis, 2019). Forces must operate at pace and against an adversary
contesting all domains. This tempo necessitates moving beyond NATO's
past focus on synchronisation of pre-planned effects in individual
domains towards more agile targeting and more resilience against hostile
attempts at 'disorganisation' or 'systems attack' (Thomas, 2019;
Engstrom, 2018).

Linking all this together demands novel approaches to C4ISR, as
reflected in investments in JADC2 (Harrigian, 2020). This US initiative
leverages advances in information and communication technologies such as
mesh networks, cloud and edge computing, open architectures, data
analytics, AI and machine learning, autonomy and automation,
software-defined systems, robotics, satellite communications and
sophisticated cyber and EMS capabilities (Hitchens, 2019). Future JADC2
networks must be secure, robust, resilient, agile and more
decentralised, with enough bandwidth to share data in a timely and
secure manner despite cyber attacks, jamming, spoofing or physical
destruction of communication nodes (Goldfein, 2017). Trust is also
essential, handling data from different sources and at multiple security
levels without making controls so arduous that users and devices cannot
access the network (Donaldson & Sciarini, 2019a).

Reliance on connectivity makes cyberspace, space and the EMS the 'centre
of gravity' for MDO (Hess et al., 2019). JADC2 introduces obvious
challenges from a cyber threat perspective, both in terms of the attack
surface for different threat vectors and the cascading effects from
hostile cyber activity---though, of course, existing centralised C2 hubs
also have their own vulnerabilities to cyber or physical attack (Hess et
al., 2019). Improved cyber capabilities are not only needed to secure
and enable operations in other domains (Reilly, 2020). Investments by
Russia and China to contest cyberspace and the EMS may also limit the
ability of NATO commanders to employ offensive cyber capabilities at a
time and place that will 'converge' with effects through other domains.
Securing networks against disruption is critical at the operational and
strategic levels given requirements for reach-back to headquarters,
especially constraining organisations responsible for delivering
offensive cyber effects, since these are likely to be physically located
in the homeland (Watling & Roper, 2019; Nettis, 2020).

D. Challenges for Command and Control

Any shift towards MDO also raises difficult questions about C2. NATO is
arguably already challenged by seams when executing joint warfare, let
alone a more ambitious vision of future JADC2 (Perkins & Olivieri, 2018;
Zadalis, 2018). In broad terms, this could adopt a more hierarchical or
de-centralised model, each with associated benefits, costs and risks
(DCDC, 2015). The 140 NATO C2COE has launched an MDO C2 demonstrator to
explore these issues, including how new technology might enable
accelerated decision-making, reduced reliance on siloed physical command
centres and a re-imagining of mission command for future MDO (NATO
C2COE, 2020a).

Problematically, authorities associated with using cyber capabilities
are typically held at the strategic and national level; how tactical or
operational commanders might call upon cyber means as part of future MDO
remains unclear (Nettis, 2020). Responsibilities for cyberspace also
often fall at least partly to civilian agencies, adding the complexity
of cross-government cooperation. The private sector's role developing
and applying technologies in the cyber domain (and, increasingly, space)
also necessitates that NATO work more closely with industry, academia
and others than for land, maritime or air operations (Ablon et al.,
2019). This presents operational, policy and legal difficulties for C2,
and cybersecurity challenges associated with reliance on industry-owned
networks, though Allies continue to evolve novel mechanisms for
partnering with industry to address cyber threats (Carr, 2016). There is
also the question of tempo: how to synchronise operations in cyberspace
with the delivery of effects in other domains (Reilly, 2020). Though
cyber attacks might initiate in a moment, the underlying tools and
exploits may take years to develop and the lead times and scale of their
eventual effect may be difficult to predict or measure given the
difficulties with battle damage assessment in cyberspace or the EMS
(Patrikarakos, 2017; US Joint Staff, 2019). Similarly, commanders may
lack awareness or understanding of available cyber instruments and their
limitations and effects compared to more familiar weapons in the
physical domains, limiting inclusion in joint planning and
decision-making (Carbonell, 2017).

Nonetheless, significant challenges remain with regard to jus in bello
and cyberweapons. First, distinguishing between military and civilian
targets is sometimes hard, because so many military functions and
systems rely on civilian technology.225 Although Chapter 2 gave the
example of air defence networks, which have little crossover with
civilian networks, many other targets are more complicated. Large
amounts of military communications are still sent across civilian
networks, while civilian websites can be used to coordinate military
operations.226 For instance, Kurdish militias in Syria used Google Earth
to coordinate American airstrikes on Islamic State positions.227
Although civilian technologies used for military purposes unquestionably
qualify as military objectives in times of war, they may still not
qualify as legitimate targets if there is a risk of excessive collateral
damage.228 Thus, cyberwarfare exacerbates the long-standing debate over
the definitions of military and civilian targets.229

Second, it can be very difficult to launch a proportional cyber
response, for several reasons. If Russia launched a cyberattack on a
member state's banks, as it did against Estonia, IHL would prevent NATO
from launching commensurate attacks on Russian banks, because they are
clearly civilian targets.230 Attacking a different target to achieve
similar effects would be very hard to perform. Additionally, before
launching a retaliatory cyberattack, it is difficult to anticipate
whether its likely collateral damage will be excessive in relation to
the anticipated military advantage gained.231 As Stuxnet demonstrated,
even exceptionally well-executed cyberattacks can spread in
unpredictable ways.232 If a retaliatory strike did unintentionally
contravene the principles of proportionality or distinction, it would be
extremely difficult to hold NATO to account. If NATO breaches IHL, its
constituent members are held accountable in international courts and
tribunals.233 However, it is very hard for victims to determine exactly
which state is responsible because they lack mission- specific
knowledge, while NATO's documents are mostly classified.234 The highly
secretive nature of cyber operations would likely aggravate this.

Finally, it would likely be very challenging to pool members' sovereign
capabilities in the first place, because they currently abide by
different legal codes in cyberspace. This is even posing a problem at
the CyOC. According to Eneken Tikk of the Cyber Policy Institute in
Finland, the legal 'elephant in the room' at Mons is bringing national
realities and strategic ambitions together.235 The starkest example of
this problem is different member's legal conceptions of sovereignty in
cyberspace. Although France perceives any penetration of its networks as
a violation of sovereignty, the UK has instigated a lively legal debate
by stating that it does not recognise sovereignty in cyberspace at
all.236 Moreover, the UK actually accepts that it cannot entirely
conform to the laws of armed conflict when using offensive cyber in a
deterrence capacity.237 It seems it would be very hard for NATO to
follow international law if its own members admit they cannot.
Meanwhile, with regard to jus in bello, the US labels war-sustaining
objects, such as munitions factories, as military objectives susceptible
to lawful attack.238 However, most other states do not adopt the US
approach, most likely because attacking these targets risks infringing
on the principles of proportionality and distinction.239 Overall, NATO
would face three very tough legal challenges if it were to form a joint
offensive cyber capability. It would have to navigate the uncertainties
of jus ad bellum, before selecting targets judiciously in accordance
with jus in bello. Plus, to even establish the capability, it would have
to iron out some of its members' key legal disagreements. This would not
be easy and it would be unrealistic to hope to establish a joint
capability in the short-term. However, it could be possible long-term,
as Chapter 5 elaborates.
