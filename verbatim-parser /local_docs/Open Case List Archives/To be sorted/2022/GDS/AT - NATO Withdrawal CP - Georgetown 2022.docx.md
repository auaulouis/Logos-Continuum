### nato good / withdrawal bad

#### NATO withdrawal fails -- lack of deterrence, irreplaceability, and unchecked Russia risks global conflict

[NATO frankly does its best work when no one hears about it. **Its
strength lies in the day-to-day military cooperation it fosters and the
general sense of deterrence and stability it promotes**]{.underline}.
[These contributions are neither as dramatic as facing off against the
Red Army at the height of the Cold War, nor as controversial as the
Libyan intervention, but they would be glaring in their absence. Why
arbitrarily remove the structure that provides that stability---both
with Russia and also among NATO's many disparate members? Withdrawing
NATO protection from the Baltic states or the smaller Balkan members,
for example, will not preclude the possibility of their becoming
involved in a war with Russia or Serbia; just the opposite, **it could
make it more likely.** Once such a conflict begins, is it certain the
United States will not be entangled or affected even if it is no longer
actively participating in NATO?]{.underline} Again, it is worth
reiterating that NATO is an instrument. Many of the alliance's opponents
may actually be opposed to the way the United States and its partners
have employed force since the end of the Cold War---especially in the
case of operations falling under the rubric of regime change. The
argument, implicit in Posen's OpEd, for example, is that NATO needs to
be taken away from reckless U.S. policymakers to prevent them from
future adventures. This argument is backwards. [Yes, the consequences of
three decades of continuous military operations should be examined. But
increasing national restraint and making better strategic decisions
seems like a smarter path than summarily scrapping an effective, tested
tool that could play an essential role in a wiser foreign
policy.]{.underline} NATO's advocates are also prone to hyperbole, but
one word that is not an overstatement is irreplaceable. **[It would be
difficult---if not impossible---to recreate NATO or something like it
from scratch.]{.underline}** Still, [even irreplaceable doesn't imply
permanence if the alliance's value cannot readily be established and
sold to the populations of its constituent members, especially
Americans.]{.underline} Demography is not on the alliance's side. Should
NATO survive to celebrate its centennial, the generation being born at
that time will be as far removed from the end of the Second World War as
someone born in 1969 was from the conclusion of the American Civil War.
Even the September 11th attacks---and NATO's ensuing invocation of
Article 5---will be a half century in the past. In short, shared
historical experience or even simple nostalgia will not be enough to
sustain the alliance through the twenty-first century. [NATO needs to
show that it is not just relevant, but crucial to continued security in
Europe and, to be blunt, the broader interests of its essential member,
the United States. The most effective way of doing that is reinforcing
the image of NATO as a vehicle for stability, something which has been
recently diminished.]{.underline} There are legitimate arguments to be
made that NATO now endangers American security by having antagonized
Russia through enlargement and increased the likelihood of
confrontation, possibly a nuclear one, rather than decreasing it.\[15\]
[That relations between America and Russia---and overall stability in
Eastern Europe---might be far worse without the alliance is also
true,]{.underline} but is a difficult sell in trying to promote the
alliance's relevance. [NATO needs to be an active participant in visibly
promoting stability, beyond the important day-to-day but low-key role it
plays in this regard.]{.underline} Some potential steps are obvious, the
most high profile of which would be a public declaration on closing the
alliance to further expansion after the current candidacy of North
Macedonia is vetted. To be clear, such a move need not be taken in a
vacuum. In general, [NATO must engage with Russia and some sort of quid
pro quo shouldn't be ruled out on ending further expansion of the
alliance]{.underline}. Cessation of Moscow's support for separatist
activities in Transnistria and the Donbass certainly should be on the
table as should guarantees from Russia that Belarus and Ukraine would be
free to pursue their own independent relationships with the West,
perhaps to someday include the possibility of membership in the European
Union if either state wants it.\[16\]

#### Withdrawal blows up the world\--causes Russian SOI AND balkanization.

[What would a world without NATO look like?]{.underline} It is a useful
question to ask. For the end of NATO would mean far more than merely the
disappearance of a bureaucracy at the outskirts of Brussels. [[The **end
of NATO**]{.mark} [would mean the end of a]{.mark} unique
institutionalized [**political and military link** between Europe and
North America]{.mark}---[with **consequences**]{.mark} that range from
merely uncomfortable to **outright dangerous**.]{.underline}

[The end of NATO [would be the end of **transatlantic collective
defense**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Europe would have to provide for its
security without the United States. [[Establishing a **purely European
defense**]{.mark}, however, [would **overwhelm** the Europeans
**politically**]{.mark}, **[financially]{.mark}**, [and
**militarily**]{.mark}. Not only would it require significantly higher
defense expenditures, but also **massive investments** in defense
research and development and much more rationalized defense
procurement]{.underline} -- just when the United Kingdom, Europe's
biggest defense player, is distancing itself from the EU. It would
ultimately require a genuine European security policy, including a
consensus on a European nuclear deterrent. [In short, it would require a
**quantum leap** in the process of **European integration** that is
**utterly unrealistic**.]{.underline}

At the same time, [the end of NATO [would **dramatically increase**
Russia's **weight and influence** in Europe]{.mark}an
security]{.underline}. [**[Without]{.mark} the [American
commitment]{.mark}** to the old continent, [the **opportunities** for
Russia to **divide and marginalize** Europe would
grow]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This would be a **strategic disaster** in
particular for many [countries]{.mark} in the post-Soviet space, who
[would be **condemned**]{.mark}, once again, [to fall **within Russia's
s**]{.mark}**phere [o]{.mark}f [i]{.mark}nfluence.**]{.underline}

This year, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization marks its 70th
anniversary. In the world of international statecraft, such long-lasting
alliances are exceedingly rare. [NATO's longevity is due in part to the
fact that it combines national interest, which can be fleeting, with
national values, which are hopefully more lasting.]{.underline} The
initial alliance between the United States, Canada, and 10 European
nations founded in 1949 has grown to encompass 29 countries. Once
ratified by all current members, North Macedonia will join as NATO's
30th member. Some, though, most notably the president of the United
States, have questioned whether NATO membership is still in the U.S.
national interest. **[While the White House avers that the U.S.
commitment to NATO remains solid, even the perception of a breach
between Europe and America would foster Russia's longstanding desire to
rupture the alliance.]{.underline}** The Trump administration's concern
over burden sharing is by no means a new issue -- it has been an
off-and-on irritant over much of the alliance's history. In the 1970s,
Europe was spending approximately 45 percent of what the United States
was spending on defense. The Center for Transatlantic Relations notes
that three factors combined to address the disparity: Moscow was
becoming more belligerent, America was preoccupied in a longstanding
conflict in Vietnam, and Europe was enjoying a period of relative
prosperity. By the end of the Cold War, Europe was spending
approximately 78 percent of U.S. levels. Today's situation is somewhat
analogous: Moscow is becoming more belligerent, America is engaged in a
17-year war in Afghanistan (side-by-side with our NATO allies), and
Europe is enjoying relative prosperity. And European defense spending is
beginning to rise. As Daniel Fried, the assistant secretary of state for
Europe from 2005 to 2009, put it, "By all means, America should push for
greater allied defense spending. But today (and everyday) let's also
remember --- and respect --- the sacrifice that others have made for
us." The values that bind the alliance have remained constant, but NATO
has not been static. In fact, [its durability is linked to its
flexibility -- changing and modernizing as threats have grown and
receded. It's important to recognize that NATO succeeded in its core
historical mission -- deterring an aggressive rival and keeping the West
strong and free.]{.underline} Established in the first phase of the Cold
War, NATO was one response to the vacuum created after World War I, when
America sought to disengage from Europe's power struggles and conflicts.
In contrast to the Senate's refusal to approve the treaty establishing
the League of Nations, America sought after World War II to fashion a
new and lasting international architecture. That included the United
Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the forerunner of the World Trade
Organization), and a host of security agreements and alliances, most
notably NATO. Beginning with President Harry S. Truman and continuing
through the Cold War, presidents and Congresses of both parties embraced
this American-made architecture that helped the United States realize
historic prosperity, saw freedom expand across the globe, and prevented
a devastating nuclear war with an aggressive and expansionist Soviet
Union. [While regional conflicts were frequent and often bloody, the
theory of mutually assured destruction (MAD) contained the 50-year
standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union]{.underline}.
The uneasy peace was costly and often tense -- the Cuban Missile Crisis,
conflict in the Middle East, Vietnam -- but a cataclysmic third world
war was avoided. Western resolve, expressed in the alliance, prevented
Soviet aggression and victory. [The reduced tensions of détente largely
fell apart after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, awakening
Americans and Europeans alike to the fact that the Soviets still posed
an existential threat.]{.underline} The decision to deploy a new class
of missiles in Europe spawned the nuclear freeze movement and severely
strained the alliance. [But the fact that NATO held together was a key
moment in the Soviet Union's defeat.]{.underline} Western resolve placed
unsustainable pressure on the Soviets and their allies. The system
collapsed in the 1980s and 1990s, as a new Soviet leader found it
impossible to compete. The rise of the independent labor union
Solidarity in Poland led to free elections, as Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev refused to intervene. The fall of the Berlin Wall and a series
of mostly bloodless revolutions rolled out across Central and Eastern
Europe. And long suppressed nationalism within the Soviet Union -- in
Lithuania, Ukraine, and elsewhere -- led to the dissolution of the USSR
itself on December 26, 1991. The map of Europe was remade. Fifteen
states emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union. Most of them,
including Russia, sought a democratic and free market future. Many
declared their ambition to join the European Union and NATO. Over the
next two decades, 13 post-communist nations took their rightful places
as full members of the North Atlantic Alliance. [But the question arose
-- what was the purpose of NATO when its main foe was no longer a threat
(or even existed)?]{.underline} Since the fall of the Soviet Union and
its Warsaw Pact allies[, NATO has reinvented itself. The alliance built
to face down the Soviets has taken on new challenges and missions,
proving it remains **the most important U.S. alliance.**]{.underline}
[NATO's current mission was laid out in 2010. The alliance remains a
mutual defense pact -- each member commits to defend the others against
attack, including against "new threats to the safety of our
citizens."]{.underline} It also maps out the importance of conflict
management -- preventing and managing conflicts and stabilizing
post-conflict situations. [NATO is committed to working with partners
around the globe, to working toward a world without nuclear weapons, and
to allow European democracies that meet the standards for membership to
join the alliance.]{.underline} One of the first major tests for the
post-Soviet NATO occurred after Yugoslavia's dissolution. [NATO took the
leading role in ending the fighting and bringing stability to Bosnia and
Herzegovina. From 1999 on, NATO has played a similar role in
Kosovo.]{.underline} Ending the bloodshed was a key U.S. political
priority during the Clinton administration. While the United States
could have addressed these crises alone, our NATO partners worked with
us and carried some of the load. After the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001, NATO's Article V was activated for the first and
only time in the alliance's history. Article V of the NATO Treaty
commits each member to defend the others when under attack. For
America's NATO partners, the attacks on Washington and New York were
just the same as an attack on Rome, Berlin, Toronto, or Oslo. Invoking
Article V was more than just a rhetorical expression of solidarity --
our NATO allies, along with other partners like Australia, have fought
with the United States in Afghanistan. More than 1,000 soldiers from
NATO partners have been killed. [While you may disagree on the merits of
American involvement in Bosnia, Kosovo, or Afghanistan -- they were
national security priorities of the U.S. government. In each conflict,
America's NATO partners took up arms in American-led engagements. Having
allied support lessened the burden and furthered the security priorities
of the United States. Sadly, the original rationale for NATO has
returned in new, insidious ways. The Russian experiment with democracy
that begin in the late 1980s has been all but extinguished. Vladimir
Putin's Russia has moved away from liberalism and democracy toward a
state now best characterized by authoritarianism, crony capitalism, and
corruption]{.underline}. Most importantly, Putin has acted aggressively
to restore power and land lost when the Soviet Empire imploded. In 2014,
Russia annexed Crimea, on the south of Ukraine. Moscow has sought to
encourage separatist movements in several former Soviet republics. In
2014, Russia stepped up its longstanding military interference in
Ukraine by annexing Crimea. And in Central and Eastern Europe, Russia
has pursued aggressive policies, aimed at restoring its influence.
Countries across the region have faced new kinds of threats, as Moscow
works to manipulate and discredit democratic institutions. Moscow has
also sought to silence critics and boost its influence in longstanding
democracies. In 2006, former intelligence agent Alexander Litvinenko was
assassinated in the United Kingdom. Cyberattacks have been detected in
Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and elsewhere. And in
the United States, Russia undertook an unprecedented campaign to stoke
divisions and influence the 2016 election campaign. While the immediate
threat of military conflict between Russia and the United States is low,
[Russia and other states pose a serious and changing threat to America
and its allies. **NATO is an essential first line of
defense.**]{.underline}. [NATO's mission remains first as a military
alliance, but from the earliest days, it was also a community of values.
And while at times NATO has chosen to look the other way, promoting
democracy among its members has always been a
consideration.]{.underline} Article 10 of the NATO Charter states that
by unanimous agreement, any other European state that can further the
principles of the alliance and contribute to its security may be asked
to join. Greece and Turkey joined the alliance in 1952, even though both
countries underwent long periods of military rule. [Even today, with
rising concerns about democratic backsliding in countries like Hungary
and Turkey, both countries remain active members of the
alliance]{.underline}. [But NATO's commitment to values became much more
explicit as the former communist nations began jockeying for
inclusion.]{.underline} Would-be members must demonstrate they are
market economies and stable democracies based on a respect for human
rights and the rule of law. Aspirants must live in peace with their
neighbors, peacefully resolving disputes. And joining NATO requires
civilian and democratic control over the military. [Seventy years on,
NATO remains a vital partnership and resource for the United States. It
has contributed blood and treasure to the two most recent major
conflicts -- Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}. It has adapted in
response to the new threats emanating from Moscow, shoring up defenses
in the Baltic region, partnering with states in Russia's crosshairs like
Ukraine and Georgia, and providing important communications and
coordination to defend against the ongoing cyberwarfare. NATO's critics
are not wrong to urge increased defense spending across the alliance.
Most American presidents have done so and our NATO allies are responding
to the call. But the United States as a global power will always
shoulder a greater share of the burden. As this history shows, **[we
should look at NATO not as a drain on our resources, but rather as a net
plus]{.underline}**. America and its NATO allies have faced tensions and
estrangement over policy issues. [But even when tensions have been high,
leaders on both sides of the Atlantic have always recognized that the
alliance is mutually beneficial.]{.underline} Fundamentally, [NATO has
endured because it is a community of shared values -- of democracy,
freedom, market economics, solidarity, and mutual respect. The United
States and our partners share a strong interest in preserving this
partnership -- it has worked to our common benefit for 70 years and
continues to do so today.]{.underline}

The conservative case for NATO is not that it strengthens liberal world

American national interests. In an age of great-power competition, as

Now consider the alternative. **[[American withdrawal from NATO would be
a grave error]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Not only would [[it]{.mark}
surrender the above advantages and [undo]{.mark} existing [progress in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [[would]{.mark} also [have negative
long-term implications]{.mark} globally [pertaining]{.mark} to America's
foremost long-term strategic challenge: namely]{.underline}, the
People's Republic of [[China]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Beijing extends
its influence worldwide, [[U.S. disengagement]{.mark} from NATO [would
send the signal]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} an [unreliable]{.mark}
friend**]{.underline}. America's [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and
partners in the Indo-Pacific [[would have to rethink]{.mark} the
integrated [security architecture we have]{.mark} painstakingly
[built]{.mark}]{.underline} since Eisenhower's day. This is [not to
mention the obvious and [immediate]{.mark} tactical and operational
[military advantages]{.mark} that would accrue [to Russia in Europe,
shifting the balance of power against the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline}

The irony is that the Trump administration actually has a success story
to tell about its policies toward NATO and Russia, particularly in
Europe. Under this administration, [the [U.S.]{.mark} has [provided
lethal aid to Ukraine]{.mark} to fight off Russia]{.underline}n-backed
insurgents. It [has made no concessions to Moscow]{.underline} regarding
that conflict. [It has [increased sanctions against Russia]{.mark} and
[boosted America's military presence]{.mark} in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}. [It has increased funding to the European Defense
Initiative,]{.underline} bolstered U.S. defense spending, held Russia
accountable for its breach of the INF (Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty) Treaty, and explored the place of low-yield nuclear weapons as a
necessary component of the American arsenal to deter Russian aggression.
At the same time, the [president's calls for increased European defense
spending have had]{.underline} some useful [effects.]{.underline}
Virtually [**[all NATO allies]{.mark}** have [i**ncreased**
their]{.mark} levels of **[defense spending]{.mark}** over the past two
years.]{.underline} As president, Mr. Trump has regularly reiterated his
support for NATO. The concomitant [[emphasis on allied burden-sharing is
not unreasonable]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Eisenhower regularly insisted.

In keeping with its treaty powers under the U.S. Constitution, Congress
should not be passive on this issue. [Last week, a bipartisan group of
lawmakers introduced a bill to express continuing congressional support
for the NATO alliance.]{.underline} The bill passed by a vote of 357 to
22 in the House of Representatives. The [Senate is working on similar
legislation]{.underline}.

Public-opinion polls taken over the last three years show that a solid
majority of Trump supporters, conservatives, Republicans, and Americans
continue to back the NATO alliance. Conservative voters in heartland
states such as Wisconsin certainly expect Europeans to do their fair
share in defending themselves. But they do not oppose NATO. On the
contrary, they support it.

An overarching support for America's Western alliance has been a key
component in the conservative foreign-policy approach since Eisenhower's
time. It remains relevant to this day. As conservative Republicans and
other Americans consider the costs and benefits of the U.S. alliance
system, recall Ike's wise recommendation: "Now boys, let's not make our
mistakes in a hurry."

#### NATO is not to blame for the Russian invasion 

**Stemplowska 22** \-- Zofia Stemplowska is a Professor of Political
Theory in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the
University of Oxford. Published April 27, 2022. "NATO enlargement is not
to blame for Russia's war in Ukraine"
<https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2022/04/27/nato-enlargement-is-not-to-blame-for-russias-war-in-ukraine/>
//DG

Is NATO enlargement partly responsible for the Russia-Ukraine war? Zofia
Stemplowska argues that rather than blaming countries in eastern Europe
for their desire to join NATO, we would be better served by examining
the role Russian energy exports to western Europe have played in
propping up Vladimir Putin's regime.

**[Many]{.underline}** voices in the UK and US press -- in the Financial
Times, the New York Times, the Guardian, and others -- **[suggest that
NATO is partly to blame for the Russian war of aggression against
Ukraine]{.underline}**. The argument is that by accepting NATO
enlargement up to Russia's borders, and by failing to decisively rule
out Ukrainian membership, NATO holds some responsibility for Russia's
invasion.

Does it matter whether NATO is partly to blame now that the war is
underway, and all reasonable people condemn the aggression? I would
argue that it does. First, we owe those who are defending themselves the
correct moral evaluation of the causes of the war. Second, our views
about who is to blame for a war influence our views on what is
permissible as part of it, what is to be done after it has ended, and --
crucially -- how to behave in similar situations in future, when, for
instance, Finland and Sweden apply for NATO membership.

However, blaming someone does not merely mean attributing to them causal
responsibility for an outcome. It involves suggesting that things should
have been done differently and that there are things to answer for.
**[The reality is that western states do hold some blame]{.underline}**
for making the invasion possible, **[but not because of NATO
enlargement]{.underline}**. **[By buying Russian energy]{.underline}**
on Russian terms, **[western states have effectively
facilitated]{.underline}** corruption and authoritarianism inside
**[Russia]{.underline}**, strengthening Vladimir Putin's regime despite
its treatment of its neighbours.

Russia's fears

Supporters of the 'blame NATO' argument offer the following rationale.
Russia saw the enlargement of NATO as a threat to its security.
Nonetheless, NATO proceeded to admit new members right up to Russia's
borders and refused to rule out further enlargement. The resulting war
is unjustified since it is an act of aggression. But this act of
aggression is in part an expression of Russia's legitimate fear for its
interests which it views as threatened by NATO.

When talking about Russia, I have in mind the Russian ruling group --
chiefly Vladimir Putin -- whose world view may be inaccurate but whose
access to information is not restricted. Ordinary Russian citizens, in
contrast, now find it increasingly difficult to learn what the world is
like as opposed to what Putin would like them to believe.

When it comes to Russian officials, there can be no doubt that they have
repeatedly expressed fears concerning NATO enlargement. It is worth
noting that Russia has talked of NATO 'expansion', but that language
carries connotations of territorial annexation. The Russian Federation
'expanded' when it annexed Crimea. NATO was enlarged, just as the EU
was, when the new member states willingly joined.

Boris Yeltsin is quoted as saying that NATO enlargement would be
'nothing but humiliation for Russia.' He suggested a pan-European peace
force. Regarding Ukraine in particular, the head of the CIA, William
Burns, wrote in 2008 that the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO 'is the
brightest of all red lines for the Russian elite (not just Putin). In
more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian
players...I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as
anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests.'

In light of the present-day expressions of fear from Russia about the
allegedly genocidal government in Ukraine, we know that Russia's
assertions about its fears can be entirely made up. But even if we
credit the past and present statements about NATO enlargement as
genuine, we can ask ourselves how legitimate or reasonable they were or
are. If the fears express a desire to dominate Russia's neighbours then
those who indulge in them are to blame when those neighbours seek
protection.

Russia's fears express expectations of domination of the region

So how reasonable was Russia's fear of NATO enlargement in the 1990s and
since? NATO invaded Afghanistan and a US-led coalition of states invaded
Iraq. But these wars were not against Russia. What of the fact that
Russia was previously invaded from its western borders? Napoleon tried
to conquer it. Hitler invaded it two years after both him and Stalin
together invaded Poland (an act of long-planned aggression that the
Soviet Union presented at the time as a defensive move). The
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth captured the throne in Moscow in the
early 17th century.

But it is not reasonable to assume that the past and disavowed conduct
of a country is bound to be repeated no matter how the country has
changed. NATO members do not celebrate the past Polish, French and
German aggressions on Russia. They cannot be reasonably seen as
indicative of any current aspirations. If we thought countries could not
change, we would have to conclude that France currently poses a threat
to the UK and Germany to Poland. Instead, Poland rejoiced when in the
first week of the Russian war against Ukraine, on 27 February 2022,
Germany announced its rearmament.

It is difficult to understand why Russia would fear its neighbours
joining NATO if it cared about its own safety rather than its control of
the region where it once had an empire. Why is it a 'humiliation' for
Russia, as Yeltsin suggested, to have NATO members as its neighbours? A
humiliation, moreover, that has to be dealt with, by Putin, with
military attacks.

Why was there not a single voice in Russia in 2008, as Burns reported,
that argued it would be acceptable for Ukraine to join NATO? If the fear
in Russia is, as sometimes stated, that Ukraine's nationalist policies
threaten a civil war in Ukraine, which in turn threatens Russia' border
security, then we should expect at least some voices arguing for Ukraine
to join NATO and the EU. Russia's borders are the most stable where its
neighbours have managed to join NATO and the EU.

So how does **[the Russian government]{.underline}** portray NATO as a
threat to itself? It **[falsely claims that its own aggressions towards
its neighbours are defensive]{.underline}**. In effect, Russia attacks
with lethal force and claims to be defending itself. **[It is the
equivalent of an abuser justifying the murder of their
victim]{.underline}** on the grounds that they both have a right to
defend themselves. **[The 'blame NATO' argument obscures this asymmetry
in NATO-Russia relations. It does so when it credits Russia's fear as
legitimate.]{.underline}**

Blaming the victims

The 'blame NATO' argument also fails to credit the claims of the new,
and aspiring, NATO members that Russia's threat fully justifies NATO's
enlargement. Ukraine's sovereign and democratic aspirations to join
NATO, though unsuccessful, were purely defensive. Ukraine was occupied
by Russia up to 1991 and for centuries beforehand.

It suffered the Holodomor in the 1930s: the deaths of millions as a
result of Soviet policies that created a famine in Ukraine. The
occupation and the brutal treatment of Ukrainians has not been disavowed
by the current government of Russia, which sees itself as the inheritor
of the Soviet Union and the Tsarist imperial vision beforehand. Ukraine
has also suffered malicious interventions from Russia in its politics
and ongoing attacks and coercive controlling of some of its territory --
all within the last decade.

Russia's insistence that Ukraine is not allowed, on pain of invasion, to
democratically decide to join NATO and the EU amounts to insisting that
countries that share a border with Russia are not entitled to be
sovereign. For the same reason, those who mention what Russia allegedly
was or was not 'promised' about Ukraine by the US or NATO miss the
fundamental point that Russia is not entitled to decide what that future
will be.

Some countries that had been dominated or controlled by the Soviet Union
have succeeded in joining NATO. The narrative of NATO 'expansionism',
which presents it as a negligent or even offensive strategy, obscures
how difficult it was for those new member states to join. The fact that
Russia continued to be feared by those states despite the demise of the
Soviet bloc reflected Russia's insistence that it would not accept their
democratic decisions; that there was either going to be a new world
order approved by Russia or no order at all.

This unwillingness to grant agency to the new member states is visible
in much of the media coverage of the war in Ukraine. Questions such as
'should NATO fear Putin?' are sometimes posed and answered in the
negative. It is true that Putin does not threaten the sovereignty of the
old NATO members through the conventional method of territorial war. But
if we see NATO as composed of all its current members, including those
that have good reason to fear Putin, then **[blaming NATO enlargement
for Russia's aggression]{.underline}** -- and blaming Ukraine for
aspiring to be in NATO -- **[means blaming the victims.]{.underline}**

//DG

In his Feb. 15 Just Security article "Ukraine: Unleashing the Rhetorical
Dogs of War," Barry Posen argued that NATO and Ukraine should have cut a
deal with Russia because the Ukrainian military would surely be defeated
by Russia without direct U.S./Western military participation and U.S.
offers of equipment were only encouraging a potential Ukrainian
insurgency against Russian occupation that would be as bloody as it
would be futile. The prescription depends entirely on Posen's assumption
that to satisfy Russia, all Ukraine would have had to do would be "to
swallow the bitter pill of accepting armed neutrality between NATO and
Russia, rather than NATO membership."

This assumption contradicts events of recent months and the historical
record. While Vladimir Putin has claimed that his goal is keeping
Ukraine out of NATO, he also insisted that he was just conducting
military exercises. Instead, he is invading Ukraine again. He likewise
insisted in 2014 that he wasn't capturing Crimea, despite the presence
of his unidentified "Little Green Men" and his subsequent annexation of
the peninsula, or that he was not fighting in Ukraine's Donbas area in
the east all these years, despite all evidence to the contrary. There is
no reason to take Putin at his word. His Feb. 21 diatribe conferring
Russian recognition of independence for the two eastern Ukrainian
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and his order for Russian troops to move
in as ostensible "peacekeepers" shows clearly his disdain for diplomatic
resolutions.

Moreover, **[this is not even primarily about NATO]{.underline}**.

NATO's eastward expansion may have played a role in straining the
relationship between Russia and the West, but mainly because, for
Russia, seeing former satellites eagerly abandon it for the greener
pastures of Euro-Atlantic integration stung. However, **[Putin's
rhetoric and actions over almost two decades reveal that his goals
extend beyond imposing neutrality on Ukraine or even staving off further
NATO expansion. The larger objective is to re-establish Russian
political and cultural dominance over a nation that Putin sees as one
with Russia]{.underline}**, and then follow up by undoing the European
rules-based order and security architecture established in the aftermath
of World War II. **[Given these goals, Ukrainian neutrality is a
woefully insufficient concession for Putin.]{.underline}**

**[If Russia's main concern had been NATO enlargement, it would have
reacted with rhetoric and/or hostile actions in its neighborhood after
each step in the NATO expansion process]{.underline}**. The largest wave
of NATO's eastward expansion took place in March 2004, when seven
Eastern European countries joined, including the formerly Soviet Baltic
states. Russia "grumbled," as the New York Times put it then, by
adopting a Duma resolution criticizing the expansion, but **[no hostile
and sustained rhetoric followed about NATO enlargement]{.underline}** as
a Western plot against Russian interests.

#### BRI has no plan and causes massive debt -- it fails to do anything 

**Wan 19** -- Andrew Wan is a research assistant. ("A ROAD TO NOWHERE?
PROBLEMS WITH CHINA'S BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE," Baker Institute. June
27^th^, 2019.
<https://blog.bakerinstitute.org/2019/06/27/a-road-to-nowhere-problems-with-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative/>)
CTF

China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) may be the most talked-about
development plan of the century. Xi Jinping's signature plan has
captured the world's attention since its announcement in 2013, with
comparisons drawn to the ancient Silk Road and the Marshall Plan. But
recently, worldwide coverage of the BRI has grown less favorable and
more critical. Has BRI lost its luster?

The BRI now includes around 3,000 projects, according to official
Chinese sources. The majority of the BRI projects involve constructing
infrastructure to facilitate trade, which requires collaborating with
partner countries to secure lending agreements and territory rights.
BRI's flagship project and biggest success is the China-Pakistan
Economic Corridor (CPEC), a road and cable link between Pakistan's
Gwadar port to Xinjiang, China. China's BRI relies on projects financed
by Chinese policy and commercial banks rather than FDI, which requires
massive capital flow to partner countries in the form of Chinese loans.
This model makes sense when considering China's industrial overcapacity
dilemma; facing economic setbacks, China has already begun consolidating
manufacturing companies to prevent defaults on loans. China sees foreign
projects as an easy way for its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to secure
contracts and minimize losses.

However, these [massive lending projects have led to partner countries
accruing extreme debt]{.underline}. This problem was brought to the
forefront of China's second Belt and Road Forum in April. [Several
previous delegations refused to attend this year, protesting growing
concerns that China both has unethical standards and leverages debts as
a diplomatic bargaining chip in its BRI strategy]{.underline}. Notably,
Turkey also cited concerns for China's blatant oppression, through heavy
policing and internment camps, of Uighurs living along BRI pathways.
[Malaysia's prime minister, during renegotiations of nearly \$23 billion
in rail/pipeline deals, called BRI agreements "unequal treaties" and "a
new version of colonialism" before cancelling the deals altogether.
Other countries have already paid the price. Sri Lanka's inability to
resolve an \$8 billion loan for its Hambantota Port in 2017 led to a
debt-for-equity swap accompanied by a 99-year lease for managing the
port. Even Pakistan's CPEC venture has necessitated a \$6 billion
bailout from the IMF. Debt distress is a common trend with BRI projects,
and although asset seizure is rare, this trend raises valid concerns
about the sustainability and methods of BRI projects]{.underline}.

It remains unclear the degree to which BRI, a Chinese-led bilateral
initiative that employs some multilateral mechanisms to achieve
financing goals, will be guided by multilateral standards on debt
sustainability. A key factor in creating and maintaining successful
deals lies in the stability of partner countries. BRI's partners tend to
welcome China's "no strings attached" style of investment compared to
lending by Western powers conditioned on environmental concerns, human
rights, and other obligations. [Although China's system is appealing for
many developing countries, it has enabled corruption while allowing
governments to burden their countries with unpayable debts.]{.underline}
The reality is that, apart from pushing its political agenda, the West's
requirements were attached in order to lower the risk of failure. The
BRI's lack of requirements signals either an absence of educated,
informed planning or a deliberate decision to create debt stress in
BRI's partners.

The instinct may be to accept the latter conclusion, believing criticism
that the BRI's underlying motive is to expand China's geopolitical
influence through a veil of economic development. But the former seems
just as plausible. For all of its hype, [no one, not even China, seems
to know exactly what the BRI is. Aside from vague policy objectives,
there are no concrete policies that define the BRI. This lack of vision
and cohesion has already led to widespread inefficiency]{.underline}.
Studies have demonstrated that BRI projects do not align with the BRI's
proposed "geographic corridors." [This incoherence, combined with
looming industrial overcapacity, paints a credible picture that the BRI
is demand-driven and opportunistic rather than supply-driven and
centrally planned. Additionally, the vague nature of the BRI allows its
brand to be extended to almost anything, from fashion shows to dentistry
to projects that lack any Chinese involvement, all of which damage the
credibility of BRI. Distrust of the BRI brand, in turn, stifles private
investment domestically]{.underline} (only 12% of FDI goes to BRI
countries) [and abroad]{.underline} (former UK PM David Cameron's
UK-China fund is struggling to secure investors), which ensures that the
BRI continues to rely on precarious sovereign lending projects.

[The Heads of State and Government of the 30 members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have adopted NATO 2030, "a
transatlantic agenda for the future," as well as a Climate Change and
Security Action Plan]{.underline}. [The Action Plan provides a framework
to deliver on the Climate Change and Security Agenda endorsed by
NATO]{.underline} Foreign Ministers on 23-24 March 2021. The NATO Deputy
Secretary-General said the decisions make the fight against climate
change an important task for NATO for the first time.

The leaders gathered for a one-day meeting on 14 June 2021, in Brussels,
Belgium, resulting in the Brussels Summit Communique. In the Summit
outcome, the leaders identify climate change as a "threat multiplier
that impacts Allied security" and say it tests resilience and civil
preparedness, affects planning and the resilience of military
installations and critical infrastructure, and "may create harsher
conditions for our operations.

In the Communique, the leaders agree to:

[Aim for NATO to become the leading international organization in
understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on
security;]{.underline}

[Significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from military
activities and installations, formulate a target for reducing GHG
emissions by NATO political and military structures and facilities, and
assess the feasibility of reaching net zero emissions by
2050;]{.underline}

[Initiate a regular high-level dialogue on climate and security to
exchange views and coordinate further action; and]{.underline}

[Incorporate climate change considerations into NATO's full spectrum of
work, including defense planning, capability development, and civil
preparedness and exercises.]{.underline}

Also adopted on 14 June, the action plan explains that climate change
makes it harder for militaries to carry out their tasks, due to greater
temperature extremes, sea level rise, rapid changes in precipitation
patterns, and an increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather
events. The effects of climate change (e.g. desertification and the
opening up of new shipping lanes) may influence the behavior of national
governments in ways that increase instability and competition. In
addition, the disproportionate impacts of climate change on women and
girls and poor, vulnerable, or marginalized populations can create
conditions to be exploited in ways that threaten or challenge the
Alliance, the action plan states.

[The action plan includes conducting annual assessments of the impact of
climate change on NATO's strategic environment as well as on missions
and operations. It says NATO must account for impacts of climate change
on security in order to perform its three core tasks: collective
defense; crisis management; and cooperative security.]{.underline}

NATO will issue its first Climate Change and Security Progress Report at
the 2022 Summit to track progress and re-assess the level of ambition.

NATO," Atlantic Council. August 18^th^, 2018.

CTF

What would a world without NATO look like? It is a useful question to
ask. For the end of NATO would mean far more than merely the
disappearance of a bureaucracy at the outskirts of Brussels. [The end of
NATO would mean the end of a unique institutionalized political and
military link between Europe and North America---with consequences that
range from merely uncomfortable to outright dangerous.]{.underline}

The end of NATO would be the end of transatlantic collective defense.
Europe would have to provide for its security without the United States.
[Establishing a purely European defense, however, would **overwhelm the
Europeans politically, financially, and militarily**. Not only would it
require significantly higher defense expenditures, but also massive
investments in defense research and development and much more
rationalized defense procurement]{.underline} -- just when the United
Kingdom, Europe's biggest defense player, is distancing itself from the
EU. It would ultimately require a genuine European security policy,
including a consensus on a European nuclear deterrent. In short, it
would require a quantum leap in the process of European integration that
is utterly unrealistic.

At the same time, [the end of NATO would dramatically increase Russia's
weight and influence in European security. Without the American
commitment to the old continent, the opportunities for Russia to divide
and marginalize Europe would grow]{.underline}. This would be a
strategic disaster in particular for many [countries in the post-Soviet
space, who would be condemned, once again, to fall within Russia's
sphere of influence.]{.underline}

With the end of NATO, [Europe and North America would also lose an
important framework for legitimizing the collective use of military
power]{.underline}. Ambitious long-term stabilization operations like
the one in Afghanistan are only possible in a transatlantic context.
While ad hoc military coalitions between the United States and some
European states would still be possible, [the end of joint military
planning and regular exercising within NATO would rapidly downgrade
military interoperability]{.underline}.

The end of NATO would also encourage a regionalization of European
security. Without the Alliance as a strategic framework for balancing
different regional concerns, [Southern European nations would likely
concentrate on the Maghreb and the Middle East, while Eastern European
states would focus on Russia]{.underline}. [None]{.underline} of these
regional groupings, however, [would be politically coherent and
militarily powerful enough to exert decisive influence in these areas.
The result would be a further weakening of European
security.]{.underline}

By contrast, [the end of NATO would not achieve what some may hope for:
to free the United States of a major financial burden. Since the US
defense budget reflects the country's global reach, the end of NATO
would provide only marginal savings]{.underline}. By ceding its role as
a "European power," however, the United States would not only lose
strategically important military bases on the old continent, but also
its political influence in European security affairs, and the stability
generated through daily consultations with its NATO Allies. [The
geopolitical winners would be Russia, China, and all those who seek to
weaken the role of the United States in upholding international
order.]{.underline} This would not just be a bad deal, a term that is
now increasingly used in international relations. It would be an awful
deal.

Concerns are growing in many European countries that they can no longer
depend on the United States and the security guarantees enshrined in
Article 5 of the NATO treaty. President Trump's decision to withdraw US
forces from Syria marked the end of US reliability. Doubts about
America's trustworthiness have produced a flurry of driveling speeches
in 2018 on the idea of a European army. So -- what about it?

It is an old idea, which failed first in 1954 when the French National
Assembly refused to ratify the European Defence Union treaty. It has
since resurfaced from time to time but was never agreed upon and
implemented. Will it fare better now, five years after the wake-up call
produced by Russia's illegal seizure of the Crimea from Ukraine?

Quite a few initiatives have been launched in recent years. Twenty five
EU members agreed on establishing the Permanent Structured Cooperation
(PESCO). Its tiny steps towards building common force components
compelled some to rekindle dreams of a European Defense Union. Within
NATO, a similar German initiative was agreed upon: the NATO Framework
Concept (NFC). Other political ideas have popped up, such as the
creation of a European Security Council, the establishment of a Defense
Committee of the European Parliament and the suggestion -- a ridiculous
one considering its legal impossibility -- that France renounce its
permanent membership in the UN Security Council and hand it over to the
EU. While all were well-intended, [there is simply no coherent political
will to establish a common defense of Europe, to accept majority
decisions or to transfer the defense portion of national sovereignty to
a supranational organization -- even a European one.]{.underline}

At any rate, [such a body would have to be more inclusive than the EU.
Defending Europe is politically impossible without the inclusion of the
United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland and even Turkey]{.underline}. And in
terms of geostrategy, [it is not feasible without control of the North
Atlantic and adjacent parts of the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}.

[As long as this reality persists, there will be no meaningful European
Security and Defense Strategy leading to command and control
arrangements, to joint operational concepts and to a common and, above
all, comprehensive planning process encompassing all political and
diplomatic tools: economic instruments, police capacities, security and
disaster relief elements and military forces that can operate throughout
Europe and its periphery on land, in the air, at sea, in outer space
**and in cyberspace.**]{.underline}

[None of the steps taken so far make much of a difference. The sad
European reality will thus continue]{.underline}. Our armies will
comprise 17 different tanks, 26 different howitzers, 20 different combat
aircraft and 29 different frigates or destroyers. Europe's defense
budgets combined total approximately 50 percent of the US budget, while
the military manpower of the Europeans is close to 50 percent greater
than that of the US, yet the combat power of the Europeans is at best 20
percent of what the US armed forces can marshal.

[Moreover, a unanimous decision on the use of European military power is
rather unlikely; if such a decision were made, the command arrangements
would be patchy at best]{.underline}. The EU Battlegroups established in
2004 is a telling example: They never saw action.

#### The EU cannot fill in -- failed on Ukraine and are reliant on NATO

**[The Russia-Ukraine war has revealed Europe's inability to protect the
Ukrainians and to deter Russia]{.underline}** from invading Ukraine, as
happened in the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Why did Europe fail
to prevent this war?

First and foremost, due to *security idiosyncrasies**[.]{.underline}***
**[Europe is not a collective security guarantor]{.underline}**. It
dismissed this opportunity in 1954 when France refused to establish a
European Defence Community (EDC). Thus, despite continuous efforts ever
since, Europe does not have an army nor a deterrent capability. **[It
is, in fact, highly dependent on NATO]{.underline}** and individual
nuclear powers (predominantly the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK and
France) to guarantee its collective security.

However, the Russo-Ukrainian war displays the Euro-Atlantic community's
inability to maintain security assurances previously given to Kyiv under
the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. In this political agreement, the US, the
UK and Russia pledged not to use military force against Ukraine in
exchange for it renouncing the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the
Soviet Union. Russia violated this agreement at least twice -- with the
2014 annexation of Crimea and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine -- and the
Euro-Atlantic guarantor countries failed to protect Ukraine.

However, the Memorandum's greatest weakness lay in the fact that it was
only politically, and not legally, binding. This is why Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy demands legally binding security
guarantees instead of the Memorandum's politically binding security
assurances.

As a non-nuclear weapon state, which is not protected under a security
guarantee by a nuclear weapon state or a nuclear alliance such as NATO,
Ukraine was exposed to aggression or intended regime change carried out
by an NPT-recognised nuclear weapon state. Hence, Europe and NATO could
not have provided a nuclear umbrella to a non-allied state such as
Ukraine. Without security guarantees or NATO's extended nuclear
deterrence, Ukraine was on its own in its direct confrontation against
Russia.

Given the inability of major nuclear powers to uphold the Budapest
Memorandum and the difficulty of enforcing credible security assurances
due to Moscow's actions, Ukraine proposed, on 29thMarch, security
guarantees in which guarantor countries (such as the P5) must consult
each other within three days after the beginning of military aggression
or hybrid war. Within this scheme, after consultations, this group of
countries must provide aid to Kyiv by sending troops, supplying weapons,
and protecting Ukraine's airspace. Ultimately, this proposal would
exclude security guarantees potentially given by NATO or the EU and
would 'deresponsibilize' Europe as a collective security guarantor of
Ukraine.

The second reason Europe failed to prevent Putin's war in Ukraine is
because of nuclear policy choices. **[The EU is basically a
non]{.underline}**- **[actor]{.underline}** (in proliferation not a
nuclear deterrent one) who supports the NPT as the cornerstone of the
global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime. Since Ukraine's
independence in 1991, the EU has shown that its interests lie primarily
in the physical protection of nuclear facilities and materials of the
former Soviet states, leading to the establishment of TACIS. Indeed,
**[Brussels]{.underline}** **[proved to be more concerned about the
energy aspects]{.underline}** of nuclear security, generated mainly by
the outcome of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, **[than with the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.]{.underline}**

It was only in the aftermath of Moscow's invasion of Crimea and Donbass
in 2014 that the EU's Russia policy took Ukraine's security seriously
into account. But Brussels did not provide nuclear deterrent
capabilities against Russia for the reasons stated above and, most
importantly, as it is a de facto NPT regime guarantor.

The EU is critical of the view that more nuclear weapons can induce
stability and decrease the chances of crisis escalation (nuclear
stability theory), prominently defended by neo-realist Kenneth Waltz. As
an NPT regime guarantor, Brussels supports the idea that nuclear
proliferation is potentially the greatest threat to international and
European security, requiring a concerted and multilateral response. For
example, the 2003 EU Strategy against Proliferation of WMD stated that
the spread of nuclear weapons to additional states not only increases
the likelihood of interstate nuclear conflict but increases the chances
of nuclear material falling into the hands of violent non-state groups
who are free from the threat of nuclear retaliation.

Therefore, **[the EU has been more politically engaged]{.underline}** in
ensuring Kyiv would not obtain nuclear weapons (mentioned, for example,
in Article 11 of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement) **[than in
providing Ukraine with]{.underline}** some kind of
'**[security]{.underline}** (nuclear) umbrella'.

The third reason is due to divergent political interests among EU member
states. Since March 2014, the **[EU]{.underline}** has adopted a strict
non-recognition policy regarding Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea.
This policy led to substantive sanctions against Russia and prompted the
EU to agree on five guiding principles to punish Russia's aggression
against Ukraine. However, these **[actions did not deter
Moscow]{.underline}** in Ukraine nor prevent the EU from negotiating
trade and energy deals with Russia. **[A lack of coherence among EU
members affected the effective implementation of]{.underline}** the
guiding principles and restrictive **[measures]{.underline}** due to
different political interests and positions towards Russia conditioned
by threat perceptions, economic interests,and energy dependence.

#### Turn: The EU is too reliant on Russian energy to effectively deter -- without NATO, no deterrence

//DG

Before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, four key threat perception
conclusions emerged: 1) a state geographically close to an adverse
nuclear power increases threat perception (e.g. Finland and Sweden); 2)
a state geographically far from an adverse nuclear power decreases
threat perception (e.g. Portugal and Spain); 3) a shared history of
conflict increases threat perception (e.g. the Baltic States and
Poland); 4) a non-shared history of conflict decreases threat perception
(e.g. Italy). In sum, the different degrees of threat perception of each
European state towards Russia undermined the idea of European solidarity
and cohesion and, ultimately, the effectiveness of the EU as a political
player with regard to Ukraine.

**[Europe's energy dependence is another]{.underline}** conditioning
**[factor]{.underline}** of political divergence **[within the
EU.]{.underline}** For example, **[the impact of Russia's policy over
EU]{.underline}** politics towards Ukraine, especially through its
bargaining power **[in the energy sector]{.underline}** (namely through
Russian business proxies Nord stream and Gazprom), **[led the Union to
become more inactive and less effective]{.underline}**. **[Other Russian
activities]{.underline}** -- such as increased activities of Russian
funded media, intensified contact between Brussels and other European
countries with Moscow, the spread of disinformation, and the sponsoring
of Eurosceptic political forces -- **[impacted the ability of the EU to
act effectively in opposition to Russian aggression.]{.underline}**

Furthermore, while the implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association
Agreement served as an important display of the EU's economic and
political force (soft power) towards Kyiv, **[Russia continued to be one
of the EU's main economic and trade partners]{.underline}**. In fact,
**[European countries with different economic interests continued to
negotiate large trade and energy deals with Russia at least until
February 2022.]{.underline}**

This contrasting dual **[approach led to]{.underline}**, even if
indirectly, **[the continuous funding of Moscow's aggression
machine]{.underline}** in Ukraine. For example, despite the 2014 EU arms
embargo, according to a recent report, ten EU member states (France,
Germany, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Finland,
Slovakia and Spain) exported weapons to Russia until at least 2020.
These countries relied on the use of a legal loophole in EU regulations
that allowed the continuation of arms exports "contracts concluded
before 1 August 2014 or ancillary contracts necessary for the execution
of such contracts". These legal loopholes, combined with other
conditioning factors of political divergence, contributed to the
half-hearted implementation of the EU sanctions policy.

Ultimately, **[Europe could not prevent a Russian military
invasion]{.underline}** of Ukraine **[because of the EU's]{.underline}**
security idiosyncrasies, nuclear policy choices, **[divergent political
interests, energy dependency and ineffective]{.underline}** sanctions
**[policy on Russia]{.underline}**. Despite its failure to prevent the
war, Europe has taken relevant steps over the past two months to respond
to the invasion: They have rapprochement with their Atlantic allies (the
UK and the US) and, among other initiatives, have established a
Strategic Compass on Security and Defence, which could represent a
unique opportunity for the EU tobecome a "more assertive and decisive
security provider".

The European ambition to seek strategic autonomy amid rising concerns
over U.S. commitments to the continent and over Russia's revisionist
behavior raises an important counterfactual question: **[Could Europeans
develop an autonomous defense capacity if there were]{.underline}** a
complete **[U.S. withdrawal from Europe]{.underline}**? Although a U.S.
withdrawal from Europe is unlikely in the short term, it is hardly a
far-fetched scenario for the longer term. Examining this counterfactual
is useful for two key reasons. First, a complete U.S. withdrawal---one
entailing an exit from NATO and the withdrawal of all U.S. conventional
and nuclear forces from the continent---is the strongest possible
incentive that could drive the Europeans to pursue strategic autonomy,
and is therefore the best way to assess their capacity to do so. Second,
examination of this counterfactual advances the U.S. grand strategy
debate in light of the prominent theoretical argument from U.S.
"restraint" scholars such as Barry Posen, who argue that a U.S.
withdrawal is warranted on the grounds that Europe can quickly and
easily create an effective deterrent to Russia.9 As we explain, Europe
is the key fulcrum in the grand strategy debate between these restraint
scholars and "deep engagement" scholars, who favor maintaining current
U.S. security commitments in Europe and elsewhere.10

Determining whether Europeans could achieve strategic autonomy anytime
soon if the United States were to pull back from Europe requires an
examination of the historical trajectory and the current and likely
future state of European interests and defense capacity. Although
existing studies have analyzed important elements of each, a more
systematic analysis is needed.11 Regarding interests, this article
provides the most comprehensive and thorough coding of national threat
perceptions across all of Europe, showing where each country falls
across a set of defined categories of threat prioritization. Concerning
defense capacity, it adds to existing understandings of Europe's
deficiency by providing novel longitudinal data on European conventional
defense capabilities over the past three decades and by outlining a
series of four interwoven challenges that would greatly complicate the
pursuit of strategic autonomy.

Our analysis shows that [**European efforts to achieve strategic
autonomy will be hampered by** two major **constraints: profound defense
capacity shortfalls** that will be hard to close, **and** "strategic
cacophony," that is, **profound, continent-wide divergences across all
the domains of national defense policies,**]{.underline} most notably
threat perceptions.12 These mutually reinforcing constraints impose a
rigid limit on the capacity of Europeans to achieve strategic autonomy
anytime soon. Consequently, **[if the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[were to withdraw]{.underline}** fully,
[**the continent would become significantly more vulnerable to Russian**
meddling and **aggression**]{.underline}. Furthermore, **[if the
U.S.-backed NATO were to disappear, this would undermine the only
institutional framework that has fostered some degree of coordination in
Europe]{.underline}** (at the strategic, doctrinal, and capability
levels) and partly contained Europe's strategic cacophony.
**[This]{.underline}**, in turn, **[would make]{.underline}**
institutionalized, intra-**[European defense cooperation appreciably
harder]{.underline}**.

Ultimately, we conclude that **[the notion that Europeans would be able
to achieve defense autonomy following a U.S. pullback is
illusory.]{.underline}**13 And if even the major shock of a complete
U.S. pullback would be very unlikely to move Europe away from its
current strategic cacophony and capability shortfalls, a partial U.S.
pullback---a much more likely counterfactual---would be more unlikely to
do so. The policy implication is straightforward: if the United States
wants European stability, it needs to stay in Europe.

European Defense Capacity Shortfall

European national assessments thus diverge profoundly regarding the
prioritization among different threats. Significantly, Europe's
strategic cacophony greatly exacerbates a second overarching
**[constraint on Europe achieving strategic autonomy: severe military
capacity gaps that cannot be closed anytime soon.]{.underline}** Since
the end of the Cold War, Europe's defense capacity has markedly
decreased.88 Operationally, the 2011 European military action in Libya
revealed a severe shortage of key enablers for offensive military
operations: the United States had to provide critical capabilities that
the Europeans otherwise lacked, such as air-to-air refueling;
suppression of enemy air defenses; and intelligence, target acquisition,
and reconnaissance.89 Indeed, a recent systematic study by the
International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and the German
Council on Foreign Relations found that, **[because their capability
shortfalls are so significant, Europeans would struggle to autonomously
undertake operations even at the low end of the spectrum of
conflict]{.underline}** (such as peace enforcement missions).90

[The commandant of [NATO]{.mark} Defense College said the
[cohesion]{.mark} of the alliance [has been]{.mark} even
[reinforced]{.mark} [by]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin\'s recent actions]{.mark}, [now]{.mark} that [the region sees
the Russian threat.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

Lt. Gen. Olivier Rittimann told Anadolu Agency in an interview that
Ukraine was a partner of NATO and so there is a difference between a
partner and an ally.

\"[Cohesion of NATO has been even reinforced by what]{.underline}
President Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} has been trying to achieve in Russia.
Because now he [**proved that Russia is actually a threat** for
Europe]{.mark} and the whole area and [it]{.mark} [has]{.mark} really
[reinforced]{.mark} the [cohesion]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[solidarity]{.mark} between allies,\" Rittimann said.]{.underline}

Commenting on the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, he said
[Ukraine was a partner of NATO and the college has been working quite a
lot with Ukraine for the last 20 years.]{.underline}

\"In fact, if the recent events had not happened, we would have gone to
Ukraine to work together in two weeks. Of course, we had to postpone
this under the current conditions. I hope we just postponed it,\" he
added.

He also stressed the [Russian aggression that started in 2008 in
Georgia]{.underline} and which [continued in 2014 in Crimea and
Donbas.]{.underline}

\"So what [[it proves]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[that]{.mark} \... [if
you are a NATO ally you are still safe because we are]{.mark}
([in]{.mark}) a [solidarity with 30 allies]{.mark} [working]{.mark}
together [and defending]{.mark} us [together]{.mark},\" he
said.]{.underline}

Rittimann said [the common response by every NATO member, every ally was
to reject \"this Russian invasion of Ukraine.\"]{.underline}

\"I think that enlargement is something that needs to be decided first
by NATO if they are accepting somebody to become a member and then by
the nation which is interested in becoming a NATO member it is
definitely not Russia nor China nor any others who has to decide whether
Ukraine can become a NATO member or not.

\"It is something that has to be discussed between the thirty members of
NATO and the applicant. It\'s not to be interfered by anyone else,\" he
added.

[Less than [three years ago]{.mark},]{.underline} while President Donald
[[Trump]{.mark} [was threatening]{.mark} [not to defend allies]{.mark}
who didn't pay enough for the privilege, French President Emmanuel
[Macron]{.mark} [was]{.mark} [lamenting the "brain death of
NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline}" Things hardly seemed to improve when
President Biden pulled U.S. troops out of Afghanistan (a NATO mission)
after scant consultation with allies. As Kabul was falling, the Wall
Street Journal ran an editorial headlined, "How Biden broke NATO."

It turns out [NATO is neither brain dead nor broken.]{.underline} [The
unprovoked [Russian]{.mark} [invasion of Ukraine has given the
alliance]{.mark} a [new lease on life]{.mark}, [making]{.mark}
[it]{.mark} [more]{.mark} politically [united and]{.mark} militarily
[formidable]{.mark}]{.underline} than at any time [[since the end of the
Cold War]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[NATO stands as one against Russian barbarism in Ukraine]{.mark}. Even
Germany is boosting its anemic defense spending and finally sending
heavy weaponry to Ukraine.]{.underline} [Other states are doing far
more, with the United States, Poland, Canada and Britain leading the way
in providing arms and ammunition. [NATO is doubling the number
of]{.mark} battalion-size "[battlegroups]{.mark}"
[deployed]{.mark}]{.underline} to the front-line states of Eastern
Europe, from four to eight, while [the United States has increased its
troop deployment in Europe from 80,000 to 100,000
personnel]{.underline}.

Now even [Sweden and Finland]{.underline}, which have long maintained
their neutrality, [are declaring their desire to join the alliance. They
are almost certain to be admitted]{.underline}, despite Turkish
reservations and predictable hand-wringing from pseudo-"realists" about
provoking the Russian bear.

[With Sweden and Finland as members, NATO will hit the strategic
jackpot. Admitting them to NATO isn't an act of charity. They are
formidable military powers in their own right]{.underline} that can
substantially contribute to deterring further Russian aggression.

[Finland has a massive artillery force of 1,500 cannons along with F-18
fighter jets, multiple launch rocket systems, armored howitzers, a
variety of precision-guided munitions and other high-tech
systems.]{.underline} [Helsinki]{.underline} is increasing its defense
spending and [recently finalized a deal to buy 64 F-35
fighters.]{.underline} Its active duty military is small (only 22,000
personnel), but it [maintains conscription and can quickly
mobilize 280,000 troops --- a far larger force than what Russia sent
into Ukraine.]{.underline}

The Kremlin made all sorts of threats to dissuade Finland from joining
NATO, but the Finns aren't deterred. They remember the heavy losses they
inflicted on Russian invaders in the 1939-1940 Winter War and are not
impressed by the poor performance of the Russian military in Ukraine.
Finland was even prepared for a cut off of Russian electricity that
began on Saturday. Seeing that his bluster wasn't working, Russian
dictator Vladimir Putin was already backing away from his threats on
Monday.

[Sweden has roughly twice Finland's population and a larger defense
budget]{.underline} but a smaller military, with an active-duty force of
24,000 and only 31,800 reserves. But [Stockholm is also increasing
defense spending and expanding its armed forces. Its air force has
ordered 204]{.underline} of the domestically produced,
[top-of-the-line JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft.]{.underline} [Sweden
also manufactures quiet diesel submarines, and its navy plans to
increase its submarine fleet]{.underline} from four to five while also
buying new corvettes.

Sweden's most important asset may be the island of Gotland, an
unsinkable aircraft carrier in the middle of the Baltic Sea. With
Gotland as a NATO base, the Baltic can become a NATO lake, just as
British control of Malta turned the Mediterranean into an Allied lake in
World War II. NATO planners have long feared that, in a war, it would be
hard to resupply Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania because of all the
weapons systems that Moscow has stockpiled in Kaliningrad, a Russian
enclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania. [Having Sweden and Finland
in the alliance is a game changer and tilts the Northern battlefield in
NATO's favor.]{.underline}

NATO should continue to bolster front-line states with permanent, rather
than rotational, troop deployments. The Baltic republics are
particularly vulnerable because they are adjacent to Russia and have
their own populations of Russian speakers, whose presence gives Putin a
built-in excuse for aggression.

Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings
Institution argues that the United States should bolster its presence in
the Baltics: "Something in the range of 10,000 American troops in the
Baltic region --- a brigade combat team (some 4,000 soldiers, plus
support), an Army combat aviation brigade, and two to three squadrons of
Air Force tactical aircraft --- likely would be sufficient." That
commitment would be sufficiently small to not interfere with the
imperative to deter China but large enough to substantially bolster the
defense of these small democracies.

[The supreme irony, of course, is that [Putin]{.mark} [justified his
attack on Ukraine by claiming that Russia could not have another NATO
state]{.mark} on its border --- even though Ukraine was not going to be
admitted to the alliance. [Now Russia's border with NATO will
triple]{.mark}, from 316 to 952 miles.]{.underline}
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} has no one but himself to blame.

Good going, Vlad. Thank you for [[strengthening
NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} If only the price, measured in Ukrainian pain
and suffering, weren't so high.

#### Russia renews NATO's purpose -- overcomes friction over democracy and unites the alliance

The [talks allowed Mr. Putin to revisit Russian grievances over how the
Cold War ended, in hopes of placing them back on the table for
renegotiation]{.underline} 30 years later. His deputy foreign minister,
Aleksandr V. Grushko, even warned the alliance off a "policy of
containment" of Russia and insisted that "free choice does not exist in
international relations" --- suggesting that Ukraine would have to bow
to Russian wishes.

But [the more the discussion evoked the Cold War --- with its firm
dividing line through Europe, and its competing Russian and Western
systems and spheres of influence --- the more it reminded European and
American allies of NATO's purpose.]{.underline}

"[[Deterring Russia]{.mark} [is]{.mark} in [the DNA of NATO]{.mark},
because [Russia]{.mark} is what [can bring]{.mark} [existential threats
to European nations]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Anna Wieslander, chair
of Sweden's Institute for Security and Development.

[That threat now is more than territorial]{.underline}, she said.
[[Russia]{.mark} [is]{.mark} also [trying]{.mark} [to undermine NATO's
democratic cohesion]{.mark}. "Russia is targeting our elections, our
social media, our parliaments and our citizens, and it is become more
obvious now that Russia is not part of our value system,"]{.underline}
Ms. Wieslander said.

As it drafts a new strategic concept to be ready this year,
[[NATO]{.mark} [is concentrating on "resilience]{.mark}"
[against]{.mark} new [hybrid]{.mark} [and cyberthreats]{.mark},
highlighting its defense of the democratic institutions of member
states, not just their territory.]{.underline}

"[NATO is its member states, and it's what allies make of
it]{.underline}," said Sophia Besch, a defense analyst in Berlin for the
Center for European Reform. "It's not out of business because we didn't
let it, and we've changed its raison d'être to what are the major
strategic concerns of the day."

T[he old joke was that if NATO is the answer, what is the
question?]{.underline} Ms. Besch responded: "[We've changed the question
over the years to make NATO the answer. And now we're back at the old
question again, where NATO is more comfortable."]{.underline}

[[NATO]{.mark} [is especially important]{.mark} now
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} those [states bordering Russia, like the
Baltic nations and Poland, a country which has had [deepening strains
with its European
partners](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/world/europe/eu-poland-rule-of-law.html)]{.underline} [over
the protection of core democratic principles]{.underline}, which
Brussels has accused the government in Warsaw of eroding.

But [[the current crisis is a reminder]{.mark}, even in Poland, [of the
importance of the alliance]{.mark} as a whole]{.underline}, and [not
just the country's bilateral relationship with the United
States]{.underline}, said Piotr Buras, head of the Warsaw office of the
European Council on Foreign Relations. [Ukraine has proved especially
vulnerable to Russian threats perhaps precisely because it is not a NATO
member.]{.underline}

"[In Poland there was concern that [NATO]{.mark} would lose its focus on
Russian security threats, but now it's obvious that this [is]{.mark}
[the only framework that can]{.mark} protect us and
[provide]{.mark}]{.underline} long-term
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}," Mr. Buras said.

[There was also anxiety that President Biden, in trying to stabilize
relations with Russia to [pivot toward
China](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/world/europe/biden-china-europe-submarine-deal.html),
would bargain away forward-based NATO troops in Poland and the
Baltics]{.underline} that were deployed after 2014.

"But [there is no sign that the United States will give in on
fundamental issues to NATO]{.underline}," like its open-door policy and
its right to deploy forces in any member state, Mr. Buras said, and
[Washington has been rigorous in briefing its allies about all of its
discussions with Russia.]{.underline}

Still, he said, the current crisis "is a very clear consequence of the
U.S. pivot to Asia and the realization of Russia that it might now take
advantage of that reorientation of U.S. fundamental security interests,"
he said. "And that issue will not go away soon."

Russia will continue to press for a new security framework in Europe,
and [Europe without the United States is not prepared to play any
significant role, he said, so]{.underline} "for Poland, [NATO is the key
and irreplaceable element."]{.underline}

[Even as Poland's battle with the European Union over the rule of
law]{.underline} still festers, [it]{.underline} [is not an overt issue
in the military alliance of NATO]{.underline}. But it was very
noticeable that as the crisis over Ukraine mounted, President Andrzej
Duda of Poland chose to veto a law, criticized by Washington, which
would have stripped majority ownership of an independent television
station from an American company.

As the security situation in Central Europe has worsened with Russian
aggression and threats, Poland "got what we finally wanted when we
joined NATO, which is allied and American troop presence on our soil ---
to finally bring NATO deployments beyond Germany," said Michal
Baranowski, who heads the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund.

That is precisely one of Russia's current demands --- that those
deployments in Poland and the Baltic States be removed, a demand
rejected by Mr. Biden and by NATO, to Poland's relief.

Still, Mr. Baranowski said, the Russians have mobilized the largest
military force in Europe since 1989, "and that's scary." The alliance,
he said, "is closer to military confrontation, but at least we have not
folded."

But [the crisis has also highlighted the continuing dependence of NATO
on Washington.]{.underline} For Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to
NATO, [what is striking is how much "this is the old NATO, where the
U.S. is the glue, linchpin and indispensable leader of the alliance,"
bringing allies together, informing them and "putting on the table the
strategy we will pursue."]{.underline}

What is extraordinary, he said, is that [more than 70 years after the
alliance was founded, "there appears to be no independent European
strategy or even a European point of view]{.underline} different from
what Washington brought to the table." [[NATO]{.mark} has
[divisions]{.mark}, of course, Mr. Daalder said. "But all the divisions
[are dissolved]{.mark}, at least [for today]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Whether that unity will last should Mr. Putin move farther into Ukraine
is yet to be seen, said Kadri Liik, an analyst with the European Council
on Foreign Relations in Berlin. She sees an unwillingness in Europe to
understand that the world is shifting.

"The wider public is not prepared for any change in the arrangements
we've lived with for the past 30 years," she said. "People think we can
still sanction Russia into obeying the European security order, and that
all it takes is Western unity and principles."

But the United States is leading the world differently, Ms. Liik said.
"I'm just not sure we can expect to continue to live in the world that
corresponds to rules and norms and expect America to enforce them."

That applies to Russia and Europe, too, she said. "We're slowly headed
back to a world" of confrontation between systems with different views
about obeying the rules and the use of power and force.

Ms. Kendall-Taylor believes that Mr. [Putin saw an opportunity to take
advantage of a shakier trans-Atlantic alliance, a divided Europe and a
polarized America]{.underline} with a weakened president.

[NATO unity is real]{.underline} but untested, she said. "It's too early
to declare all restored, because Russia not done anything yet," Ms.
Kendall-Taylor said. "It's a bit the calm before the storm."
