[United States]{.underline} or United States of America Abbr. U.S. or US
or U.S.A. or USA

[A country of central and northwest North America with coastlines on the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans]{.underline}. It includes the noncontiguous
states of Alaska and Hawaii and various island territories in the
Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. The area now occupied by the contiguous
48 states was originally inhabited by numerous Native American peoples
and was colonized beginning in the 16th century by Spain, France, the
Netherlands, and England. Great Britain eventually controlled most of
the Atlantic coast and, after the French and Indian Wars (1754-1763),
the Northwest Territory and Canada. The original Thirteen Colonies
declared their independence from Great Britain in 1776 and formed a
government under the Articles of Confederation in 1781, adopting (1787)
a new constitution that went into effect after 1789. The nation soon
began to expand westward. Growing tensions over the issue of Black
slavery divided the country along geographic lines, sparking the
secession of the South and the Civil War (1861-1865). The remainder of
the 19th century was marked by increased westward expansion,
industrialization, and the influx of millions of immigrants. The United
States entered World War II after the Japanese attack (1941) on Pearl
Harbor and emerged after the war as a world power. Washington, D.C., is
the capital and New York the largest city. Population: 302,000,000.

**[US = Includes FG]{.underline}**

**'United States' includes the federal government**

**National Atlas 13** -- "Government of the United States", 1-14,
http://www.nationalatlas.gov/government.html

Introduction

The United States of America is a democracy, which means it is governed
by the will of its people. Its government provides a system of
management for American citizens. Established in 1789, [the **U**nited
**S**tates is a federal republic]{.underline}, with a strong democratic
tradition. Its legal system is based on English common law. [The
government is divided into separate governing units. At the top level is
the Federal Government]{.underline}, which provides functions that are
best managed by a centralized government, such as defense, currency
regulation, and foreign relations. Its capital city is Washington, D.C.

Federal Government

At the Federal level, there are three branches of government: executive,
legislative, and judicial. These branches work in concert under a set of
checks and balances that ensure a relatively even distribution of
authority and power.

**[USFG = National Government]{.underline}**

**'Federal government' means the national government**

Lumen Learning, **Lumen 19**, "The Division of Powers",
https://courses.lumenlearning.com/openstax-americangovernment/chapter/the-division-of-powers/

Modern democracies divide governmental power in two general ways; some,
like the United States, use a combination of both structures. The first
and more common mechanism shares power among three branches of
government---the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. The
second, federalism, apportions power between two levels of government:
national and subnational. [In the **U**nited **S**tates, the term
federal government refers to the government at the national level, while
the term states means governments at the subnational level]{.underline}.

**They're synonyms**

Commonwealth of **Virginia 19** Department of Education, "Virginia State
and Local Civic Education Module -- Civic Education -- Federalism",
http://www.civiceducationva.org/federalism2.php

Did You Know? Federalism is a system of government in which power is
divided between a national government and other regional political
structures such as states or provinces. [While the United States has a
federal system of government, it is important to remember that the term
"federal government" is used as a synonym for the national
government]{.underline}. Other governmental power structures that exist
are unitary and confederal (confederation). In a unitary system of
government, the power to govern (and delegate administrative authority)
is held by a national (central) government. In a confederal system of
government, typically a union or league of independent states retain
their sovereignty/power but may delegate a central government or
administrative unit to work on common issues or concerns for the benefit
of all members.

## Should

**[Should = Mandatory]{.underline}**

**'Should' is mandatory**

Judge Henry **Nieto 9**, Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009 People v.
Munoz, 240 P.3d 311 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009)

[\"Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [the
**weight of authority** appears to favor interpreting \"should\" in an
**imperative, obligatory sense**]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word \"should\" in
jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld
instructions using the word. [In the courts of other states]{.underline}
in which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the
reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that
it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is
submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They
reasoned that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and
**could not be misunderstood**]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v.
McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v.
State, 217 Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995)
(finding argument that \"should\" is directional but not instructional
to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504
A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably, [courts interpreting
the word \"should]{.underline}\" in other types of jury instructions
\[\*\*16\] [have]{.underline} also [found that the word
conveys]{.underline} to the jury [a sense of duty or obligation and
**not discretion**]{.underline}. In Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554
S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [the Arkansas Supreme Court interpreted the
word \"should\"]{.underline} in an instruction on circumstantial
evidence [as **synonymous with the word \"must\"**]{.underline} and
rejected the defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by
the court\'s use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, [the
Missouri Supreme Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court
erred by not using the word \"should\" in an instruction]{.underline} on
witness credibility [which used the word \"must\" because the two words
have the **same meaning**]{.underline}. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211,
215 (Mo. 1958). \[\*318\] In applying a child support statute, [the
Arizona Court]{.underline} of Appeals [concluded that a legislature\'s
or commission\'s use of the word \"should\" is meant to convey **duty**
or **obligation**]{.underline}. McNutt v. McNutt, 203 Ariz. 28, 49 P.3d
300, 306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a statute stating that child
support expenditures \"should\" be allocated for the purpose of
parents\' federal tax exemption to be mandatory).

**'Should' means must, opposed to 'could', which means mere
[capability]{.underline} or 'might'**

Judge **Eager 69**, Supreme Court of Missouri, Division One, 6-9-1969,
Burrell v. Mayfair-Lennox Hotels, Inc., 442 S.W.2d 47 (Mo. 1969)

In the briefs both parties rely largely upon definitions, both from
dictionaries and cases. We refrain from quoting \[\*\*21\] or discussing
these specifically. [In **ordinary parlance** the word \"should\"
imports an idea of **obligation**; it is the past tense of \"shall\"
which implies \"owes, ought to, must\"]{.underline} (Webster\'s 3rd
Internat. Dict.). Defendant\'s counsel seem to recognize this meaning.
They further concede that [\"**could\"** denotes **mere \"capability\"**
and is often used as meaning **\"might.\"**]{.underline} The dictionary
generally confirms the meaning as denoting a mere ability to do or make.
Counsel further argue that the use of \"should\" thus imposed a greater
burden upon the defendant. We wholly fail to follow that argument. The
instruction, as we see it, required the plaintiff to demonstrate to the
jury by its evidence that defendant was obligated to know of the
defective condition, and not merely to demonstrate that it would have
been possible (or within its ability) to do so. Thus, in the
common-sense meaning of the language used, the plaintiff and not the
defendant bore a greater burden from the deviation. It seems possible
that defendant thinks that the instruction tells the jury that defendant
was obligated to know of the defect. Such is not true. It simply told
the jury that before it could find \[\*\*22\] for the plaintiff it must
find that, under the circumstances, defendant was obligated to know of
it. Our view as to where the additional burden was cast seems to be
confirmed in the case of Thompson v. Quincy, O. & K.C.R. Co., Mo., 18
S.W.2d 401.

**'Should' means must\-\--its mandatory**

**Foresi 32** Remo Foresi v. Hudson Coal Co., Superior Court of
Pennsylvania, 106 Pa. Super. 307; 161 A. 910; 1932 Pa. Super. LEXIS 239,
7-14, Lexis

[As regards the mandatory character of the rule, the word
\'should\']{.underline} is not only an auxiliary verb, it
[is]{.underline} also [the preterite of the verb, \'shall\' and has for
one of its meanings as]{.underline} defined in the Century Dictionary:
\"[Obliged or compelled (to); would have (to); must; ought (to); used
with an infinitive]{.underline} (without to) [to express obligation,
necessity or duty in connection with some act yet to be carried
out.\"]{.underline} We think it clear that it is in that sense that the
word \'should\' is used in this rule, not merely advisory. When the
judge in charging the jury tells them that, unless they find from all
the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of
the offense charged, they should acquit[, the word \'should\' is **not
used in an advisory sense** but has the force or meaning of \'must\', or
\'ought to\' and carries]{.underline} \[\*\*\*8\] [with it the sense
of]{.underline} \[\*313\] [obligation and duty equivalent to
**compulsion**]{.underline}. A natural sense of sympathy for a few
unfortunate claimants who have been injured while doing something in
direct violation of law must not be so indulged as to fritter away, or
nullify, provisions which have been enacted to safeguard and protect the
welfare of thousands who are engaged in the hazardous occupation of
mining.

Other legislated DA earmarks in the FY2005 appropriations bill are
smaller and more targeted: plant biotechnology research and development
(\$25 million), the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program (\$20
million), women's leadership capacity (\$15 million), the International
Fertilizer Development Center (\$2.3 million), and clean water treatment
(\$2 million). Interestingly, in the wording of the bill, Congress uses
the term *shall* in connection with only two of these eight earmarks;
the others say that USAID *should* make the prescribed amount available.
[The **difference** between *shall* and *should* may have **legal

gizmodo.com/a-single-typo-nearly-killed-the-paris-climate-accord-1747908970

[Hours before the]{.underline} historic [Paris climate
accord]{.underline} was to be ratified in a final vote, someone noticed
that a word had been changed in the final draft of the text---[a
**single word** that threatened to derail the entire deal]{.underline}.
As reported in the Washington Post, [someone changed the word "should"
to "shall."]{.underline} Now, it seems like a little thing, but
[given]{.underline} that [the words were in reference to]{.underline}
sweeping new [legal]{.underline} and financial [obligations, **it
mattered. A lot.** When it comes to **legally binding terminology**,
there's a **big difference** between "should" and "shall." Whereas
"should" is a kind of wishy-washy call to action, the word "shall"
implies an obligation]{.underline}, and this is why Secretary of State
John Kerry could not abide the unexpected change. The New York Times
reports: Throughout the process, [the longer and **less binding**
"should" was a **deliberate** part of the international
agreement]{.underline}, put there to establish that the richest
countries, including the United States, felt obligated to pony up money
to help poor countries adapt to climate change and make the transition
to sustainable energy systems. "Shall" meant something altogether
different, American officials said. When "shall" was spotted in the
document on Saturday, Secretary of State John Kerry called his French
counterpart and made it clear that unless a switch was made, France
could not count on American support for the agreement. "I said: 'We
cannot do this and we will not do this. And either it changes, or
President Obama and the United States will not be able to support this
agreement,' " Mr. Kerry told reporters after delegates had accepted the
deal by consensus Saturday night, amid cheering and the celebratory
stamping of feet. Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed, and within hours
the wording within the 31-page text was reverted back to the original
"should." A subsequent vote affirmed the Paris Accord, and all was
saved.

**'Should' means desirable\-\--this does not have to be a mandate**

**AC 99** Atlas Collaboration, "Use of Shall, Should, May Can,"
http://rd13doc.cern.ch/Atlas/DaqSoft/sde/inspect/shall.html

shall

[\'shall\' describes something that is mandatory]{.underline}. If a
requirement uses \'shall\', then that requirement \_will\_ be satisfied
without fail. Noncompliance is not allowed. Failure to comply with one
single \'shall\' is sufficient reason to reject the entire product.
Indeed, it must be rejected under these circumstances. Examples: \#
\"Requirements shall make use of the word \'shall\' only where
compliance is mandatory.\" This is a good example. \# \"C++ code shall
have comments every 5th line.\" This is a bad example. Using \'shall\'
here is too strong.

should

[\'should\' is weaker. It describes something that might not be
satisfied in the final product, but that is desirable
enough]{.underline} that any noncompliance shall be explicitly
justified. Any use of \'should\' should be examined carefully, as it
probably means that something is not being stated clearly. If a
\'should\' can be replaced by a \'shall\', or can be discarded entirely,
so much the better. Examples: \# \"C++ code should be ANSI compliant.\"
A good example. It may not be possible to be ANSI compliant on all
platforms, but we should try. \# \"Code should be tested thoroughly.\"
Bad example. This \'should\' shall be replaced with \'shall\' if this
requirement is to be stated anywhere (to say nothing of defining what
\'thoroughly\' means).

**'Should' doesn't require certainty**

**Black's Law 79** Black's Law Dictionary -- Fifth Edition, p. 1237

[Should]{.underline}. The past tense of shall; ordinarily implying duty
or obligation; although usually no more than an obligation of propriety
or expediency, or a moral obligation, thereby distinguishing it from
"ought." It is not normally synonymous with "may," and although often
interchangeable with the word "would," it [**does not ordinarily express
certainty** as "will" sometimes does. ]{.underline}

The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of
grammar;[15](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn15)
it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal
professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the
omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and
the same hereby is\", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an
expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2)
constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the
trial judge\'s intent must be garnered from the four corners of the
entire
record.[16](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn16)

In most constructions, would is the auxiliary chosen regardless of the
person of the subject: If our allies would support the move, we would
abandon any claim to sovereignty. You would be surprised at the
complexity of the directions. Because the main function of should in
modern American English is to express duty, necessity, etc. ( You should
get your flu shot before winter comes ), its use for other purposes, as
to form a subjunctive, can produce ambiguity, at least initially: I
should get my flu shot if I were you. Furthermore, should seems an
affectation to many Americans when used in certain constructions quite
common in British English: Had I been informed, I should (American would
) have called immediately. I should (American would ) really prefer a
different arrangement. As with shall and will, most educated native
speakers of American English do not follow the textbook rule in making a
choice between should and would. [See also shall.]{.underline} Shall

OF APPEALS OF IOWA 2008 Iowa App. LEXIS 287 May 14, 2008, Filed, lexis

Clyde\'s will provides, \"in the event any of my children should
predecease me leaving issue who survive me, then the share of such
predeceased child shall go in equal shares to his or her issue who
survive me, per stirpes.\" We find no error in the district court\'s
conclusion  \[\*6\] that an intent to avoid the application of the
antilapse statute is not \"clear and explicit\" from the terms of the
will. The will states \"in the event\" Clyde was predeceased by a child,
when in fact Clyde had been predeceased by two of his children at the
time the will was written. If the will was referring to the children who
had already predeceased Clyde, there would be no need to say \"in the
event.\" By stating \"in the event\" it is clear Clyde was looking ahead
to possible future events, when one of his children who were alive when
the will was written might predecease him.

phrase \"in the event any of my children should predecease me\" [and
claim the district court improperly found the word looked to the
future.]{.underline} [They claim the word should be interpreted as

Larry **Maples 7**, "Pitfalls in Preserving Net Operating Losses", The

If a new loss corporation has substantial nonbusiness assets, the value
of the old loss corporation must be reduced by the amount of the
nonbusiness assets less liabilities attributable to those assets.
[\"Substantial\" is defined as **one-third** of total
assets.]{.underline} This is a difficult provision to interpret. IRC
section 382(1)(4) provides that a value reduction in the old loss
corporation is required if, just after an ownership change, the new loss
corporation has substantial nonbusiness assets. This language seems odd
because the purpose of IRC section 382 is to prevent loss trafficking,
so it would seem that the asset test ought to apply to the old loss
corporation.

**[Quantitative Defs Good]{.underline}**

**'Substantial' must be assigned [quantitative]{.underline} meaning**

Appeals, Pomerance v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co. of Am., 288 Ga. App. 491,
494-95, 654 S.E.2d 638, 640-42,2007 (Westlaw)

Bearing these principles in mind, we must first determine whether the
policy language **\*\*641** at issue is clear and unambiguous.^2^ We
conclude that it is not. As noted, the Policies defined total disability
as "the inability to perform thematerial and substantial duties of \[the
insured\'s\] occupation." [On the one hand, "substantial" can have a
**qualitative** meaning and be defined as "important" or
"essential.]{.underline}" See Merriam-Webster\'s Online
Dictionary, [http://www.merriam-webster](http://www.merriam-webster/).
com /dictionary/substantial. [On the other hand, "substantial" can have
a **quantitative** meaning and be defined as "considerable in quantity"
or "significantly great" in amount.]{.underline} See id. Because
"substantial" is susceptible of two alternative meanings, the definition
of total disability is rendered ambiguous. Under one reading, an insured
is totally disabled if he cannot perform his important
and material duties; however, under the alternative reading, an insured
is totally disabled if he cannot perform a significantly great amount of
his material duties.

6 [As such]{.underline}, [we must]{.underline} apply the rules
of contract construction in an effort to [resolve the
ambiguity]{.underline}. See Hurst, 266 Ga. at 716(4), 470 S.E.2d 659. If
"substantial" is treated as qualitative in meaning and thus is defined
as "important" or "essential," its meaning would be interchangeable with
the meaning of "material," a term that also is used in the definition of
"total disability" under the Policies. See Black\'s Law Dictionary (6th
ed. 1990), p. 1428 (pointing out that "substantial" can be
"\[s\]ynonymous with material"); Merriam-Webster\'s Online
Dictionary,[http://www.merriam-webster](http://www.merriam-webster/).
com/dictionary/material (defining "material" as "having real importance
or great consequences"). But, it is a cardinal rule of contract
construction "that a court should, if possible, construe a contract so
as not to render any of its provisions meaningless" and in a manner that
gives effect to all of the contractual terms. VATACS Group v. HomeSide
Lending, 276 Ga.App. 386, 389(1), 623 S.E.2d 534 (2005). See also Tyson
v. McPhail Properties, 223 Ga.App. 683, 689(6), 478 S.E.2d 467 (1996)
(finding that the contract "would not have used two different terms in
two sequential paragraphs to describe the same thing"). As such, in
order to avoid rendering the term "material" as mere surplusage, [we
**must construe**]{.underline} \*495 [the term "substantial" as having
the quantitative meaning of "considerable in quantity" or "significantly
great" in amount]{.underline}. See Merriam-Webster\'s Online
Dictionary, [http://www.merriam-webster](http://www.merriam-webster/).
com /dictionary/substantial.\
7 When "substantial" is treated as distinct from the term "material" and
thus as qualitative in meaning, it is clear that an insured is totally
disabled under the Policies when he is unable to perform a significantly
great amount (i.e., most or a vast majority) of the material duties of
his occupation. Notably, this interpretation of the total disability
definition comports with that of several foreign jurisdictions that have
interpreted insurance policies containing similar language. See Giddens
v. Equitable Life Assurance etc., 445 F.3d 1286, 1296-1301(II)(D)(2)
(11th Cir.2006); Dowdle v. Nat. Life Ins. Co., 407 F.3d 967, 970(II)
(8th Cir.2005); Gladstone v. Provident Life, etc., Ins. Co., No.
1:05-CV-2868-CC, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63233 ([N.D.Ga](http://n.d.ga/).
Aug. 17, 2007); Gross v. UnumProvident Life Ins. Co., 319 F.Supp.2d
1129, 1136(III)(A) (C.D.Cal.2004).3\
\*\*642 8 In reaching this conclusion, we reject Berkshire\'s argument
that the residual disability rider, when read in conjunction with the
total disability provision, requires that total disability be defined as
the inability of the insured to perform all of the material duties of
his occupation. Rather, [we conclude that the language of the rider can
be read in a manner consistent with the definition]{.underline} of total
disability [as the inability to perform]{.underline} **[*most* or
a *vast majority*]{.underline}** [of the material duties of the
insured\'s occupation]{.underline}. The rider defines residual
disability as the "inability to do one or more of \[the insured\'s\]
important daily business or professional duties." The rider, when read
in conjunction with the definition of total disability, creates "a
continuum of disability."

In reversing a summary judgment of invalidity, [the U.S. Court of
Appeals]{.underline} for the Federal Circuit [found that the district
court,]{.underline} by failing to look beyond the intrinsic claim
construction evidence to consider what a person of skill in the art
would understand in a \"technologic context,\" [**erroneously
concluded** the term \"substantially\" made a claim fatally
indefinite.]{.underline}  Verve, LLC v. Crane Cams, Inc., Case No.
01-1417 (Fed. Cir. November 14, 2002). The patent in suit related to an
improved push rod for an internal combustion engine.  The patent claims
a hollow push rod whose overall diameter is larger at the middle than at
the ends and has \"substantially constant wall thickness\" throughout
the rod and rounded seats at the tips.  The district court found that
the expression \"substantially constant wall thickness\" was not
supported in the specification and prosecution history by a sufficiently
clear definition of \"substantially\" and was, therefore, indefinite. 
The district court recognized that the use of the term \"substantially\"
may be definite in some cases but ruled that in this case it was
indefinite because it was not further defined. The Federal Circuit
reversed, concluding that the district court erred in requiring that the
meaning of the term \"substantially\" in a particular \"technologic
context\" be found solely in intrinsic evidence:  \"While reference to
intrinsic evidence is primary in interpreting claims, the criterion is
the meaning of words as they would be understood by persons in the field
of the invention.\"  Thus, [the Federal Circuit instructed that
\"resolution of any ambiguity]{.underline} arising from the claims and
specification [may be aided by]{.underline} extrinsic [evidence of
usage]{.underline} and meaning of a term in the context of the
invention.\"  The Federal Circuit remanded the case to the district
court with instruction that [\"\[t\]he question is not whether the word
\'substantially\' has a fixed meaning]{.underline} as applied to
\'constant wall thickness,\' [but how the phrase would be understood by
persons experienced in this field]{.underline} of mechanics, upon

["Substantial" is a relative word, which, while it must be used with
**care and discrimination**, **must nevertheless be given
effect**]{.underline}, and in a claim of patent allowed considerable
latitude of meaning where it is applied to such subject as thickness, as
by requiring two parts of a device to be substantially the same

**Using context removes the arbitrariness of assigning a fixed

2.8. Legal writers who follow the economic value criterion have
generally quantified the term \"substantial part\" by comparing Article
3(1) CISG (substantial) with Article 3(2) CISG (preponderant):
substantial being less than preponderant. In this way, [legal writers
have used the following percentages to quantify substantial:
15%]{.underline},[\[14\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#14) [between
40% and
50%]{.underline},[\[15\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#15) [or
more generally
50]{.underline}%.[\[16\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#16) At
the same time, other authors, although they have not fixed any numbers
in regard to the quantification of the term \"substantial\" have
declared that \"preponderant\" means \"considerably more than 50% of the
price\" or \"clearly in excess of
50%\".[\[17\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#17) Thus
it seems that for the latter authors, the quantification of the term
\"substantial\" is placed above the 50% figure. Also, some Courts have
followed this
approach.[\[18\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#18)

2.9. [To consider a fixed percentage might be **arbitrary** due to the
fact that the particularities of each case ought to be taken into
account; that the scholars are in disagreement; and that the origin of
those figures is not
clear]{.underline}.[\[19\]](http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146#19)

[Therefore,]{.underline} [it does not seem to be advisable to quantify
the word \"substantial\" *a priori* in percentages. **A case-by-case
analysis is preferable** and thus it should be determined on the basis
of an overall assessment]{.underline}.

In *Victor*, the trial court instructed that: \"A reasonable doubt is an
actual and substantial doubt . . . as distinguished from a doubt arising
from mere  \[\*64\]  possibility, from bare imagination, or from
fanciful conjecture.\" Victor argued on appeal after receiving the death
penalty that equating a reasonable doubt with a \"substantial doubt\"
overstated the degree of doubt necessary for acquittal. [Although the
court agreed that the instruction was problematic given that
\"substantial,\" could be defined as \"that specified to a large
degree,\" it also ruled that **any ambiguity was removed by reading the
phrase in the context** of the sentence in which it
appeared]{.underline}. Finding such an explicit distinction between a
substantial doubt and a fanciful conjecture was not present in
the *Cage* instruction, it held that the context makes clear that
\"substantial\" was used in the sense of existence rather than in
magnitude of the doubt and, therefore, it was not unconstitutional
as applied. [*Id. at

banks that meet the ten percent test view their deposit-taking and
credit extension activities as substantial due in part to the resources
that must be extended to engage in those activities. In addition, you
assert that the relevant foreign financial authorities view these
activities as substantial, as evidenced by their specific regulation of
such activities. In determining whether a foreign bank derives \"a

The URAA and the SAA neither amend nor refine the language of
§ 1677(4)(C).  In fact, they merely suggest, without disqualifying other
alternatives, a "clearly higher/substantial proportion" approach. 
Indeed, the SAA specifically mentions that no "precise mathematical
formula" or "'benchmark' proportion" is to be used for a dumping
concentration analysis.  SAA at 860 (citations omitted); see also Venez.
Cement, 279 F. Supp. 2d at 1329-30.  Furthermore, as the Court of
International Trade noted, the SAA emphasizes that the Commission
retains the discretion to determine concentration of imports on a
"case-by-case basis."  SAA at 860.  Finally, [the definition of the word
"substantial" undercuts the]{.underline} CFTVC's [argument.  The word
"substantial" generally means "considerable in amount,]{.underline}
value or worth."  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280
(1993).  [**It does not imply a specific number or cut-off**.  What may
be substantial in one situation may not be in another
situation.]{.underline}  The very breadth of the term "substantial"
undercuts the CFTVC's argument that Congress spoke clearly in
establishing a standard for the Commission's regional antidumping and
countervailing duty analyses.  It therefore supports the conclusion that
the Commission is owed deference in its interpretation of "substantial
proportion."  The Commission clearly embarked on its analysis having
been given considerable leeway to interpret a particularly broad term.

The union points to the definition of "similar" in the online Oxford

like nature or kind," and in Black's Law Dictionary as "nearly
corresponding; resembling in many respects; somewhat like; having a
general likeness, although allowing for some degree of difference." In

Stephen **Reinhardt 5**, U.S. Judge for the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Jason Ray Reynolds; Matthew Rausch,
Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.;
Hartford Fire Insurance Company, Defendants-Appellees, Lexis

Specifically, we must decide whether charging a higher price for initial
insurance than the insured would otherwise have been charged because of
information in a consumer credit report constitutes an \"increase in any
charge\" within the meaning of FCRA. First, we examine the definitions
of \"increase\" and \"charge.\" Hartford Fire contends that, limited to
their ordinary definitions, these words apply only when a consumer has
previously been charged for insurance and that charge has thereafter
been increased by the insurer. The phrase, \"has previously been
charged,\" as used by Hartford, refers not only to a rate that the
consumer has previously paid for insurance but also to a rate that the
consumer has previously been quoted, even if that rate was increased
\[\*\*23\] before the consumer made any payment. Reynolds disagrees,
asserting that, [under]{.underline} \[\*1091\] [the ordinary definition
of the term, an increase in a charge also occurs whenever an insurer
charges a higher rate than it would otherwise have charged because of
any factor]{.underline}\--such as adverse credit information, age, or
driving record 8 \--[regardless of whether the customer was previously
charged some other rate]{.underline}. According to Reynolds, he was
charged an increased rate because of his credit rating when he was
compelled to pay a rate higher than the premium rate because he failed
to obtain a high insurance score. Thus, he argues, the definitions of
\"increase\" and \"charge\" encompass the insurance companies\'
practice. Reynolds is correct.

**'Increasing' means to make greater and requires pre-existence**

Jeremiah **Buckley 6**, Attorney, Amicus Curiae Brief, Safeco Ins. Co.
of America et al v. Charles Burr et al,
<http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/06-84/06-84.mer.ami.mica.pdf>

First, the court said that the ordinary meaning of the word "increase"
is "to make something greater," which it believed should not "be limited
to cases in which a company raises the rate that an individual has
previously been charged." 435 F.3d at 1091. Yet the definition offered
by the Ninth Circuit compels the opposite conclusion. [Because
"increase" means "to **make something greater**," there must necessarily
have been an **existing** premium]{.underline}, to which Edo's actual
premium may be compared, [to determine whether an "increase"
occurred]{.underline}. Congress could have provided that "ad-verse
action" in the insurance context means charging an amount greater than
the optimal premium, but instead chose to define adverse action in terms
of an "increase." That def-initional choice must be respected, not
ignored. See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392-93 n.10 (1979)
("\[a\] defin-ition which declares what a term 'means' . . . excludes
any meaning that is not stated"). Next, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that
because the Insurance Prong includes the words "existing or applied
for," Congress intended that an "increase in any charge" for insurance
must "apply to all insurance transactions -- from an initial policy of
insurance to a renewal of a long-held policy." 435 F.3d at 1091. This
interpretation reads the words "exist-ing or applied for" in isolation.
Other types of adverse action described in the Insurance Prong apply
only to situations where a consumer had an existing policy of insurance,
such as a "cancellation," "reduction," or "change" in insurance. Each of
these forms of adverse action presupposes an already-existing policy,
and [under **usual canons of statutory construction** the term
"increase"]{.underline} also [should be construed to apply to increases
of an **already-existing** policy]{.underline}. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542
U.S. 88, 101 (2004) ("a phrase gathers meaning from the words around
it") (citation omitted).

Rule 324.102(x) is unambiguous. A guiding principle of statutory
construction (and thus construction of administrative rules) is that
each word be given meaning. See Gillie v Genesee Co Treasurer, 277 Mich
App 333, 345; 745 NW2d 137 (2007). \"This Court must consider both the
plain meaning of the critical words or phrases, as well as their
placement and purpose . . . .\" Id. Rule 324.102(x) refers to \"the
purpose of increasing the recovery of hydrocarbons.\" [The word
\"increase\" means \"to add]{.underline} \[\*10\] [something to or
enlarge something **already in existence**]{.underline}.\" Gwynn v
McKinley, 30 Cal App 381, 389; 158 P 1059 (1916). [A **newly
constructed** frack well does **not** add to or enlarge the recovery of
hydrocarbons. Rather, it **initiates** the recovery of hydrocarbons when
recovery was **nonexistent**. Further, the use of the word
**\"increasing\"** presupposes that the recovery of hydrocarbons
**already exists**, as **words that end in \"-ing\"** suggest
**continuing action**]{.underline}. See Verizon New Jersey, Inc v
Hopewell Borough, 26 NJ Tax 400, 417 (2012). In other words, for a well
to be categorized as an \"injection well\" under the contested language
of Rule 324.102(x), the well must be used for the purpose of recovering
hydrocarbons before and after the injection of fluid. Here, however, it
is not disputed that the frack wells at issue are not used for the
purpose of recovering hydrocarbons before the injection of fluid. Had
Rule 324.102(x) been intended to encompass all recovery of hydrocarbons,
not only the increased recovery of hydrocarbons, it could have simply
read in relevant part, \"the purpose of the recovery of hydrocarbons\"
or \"the purpose of recovering hydrocarbons.\"

**'Increase' requires pre-existence**

**Brown 3** -- US Federal Judge on the District Court of Oregon, "Elena
Mark and Paul Gustafson, Plaintiffs, v. Valley Insurance Company and
Valley Property and Casualty, Defendants", 7/17/2003, Lexis

FCRA does not define the term \"increase.\" [The plain and ordinary
meaning of the verb \"to increase\" is to make something
greater]{.underline} or larger. 4 Merriam-Webster\'s \[\*\*22\]
Collegiate Dictionary 589 (10th ed. 1998). The \"something\" that is
increased in the statute is the \"charge for any insurance.\" The plain
and common meaning of the noun \"charge\" is \"the price demanded for
something.\" Id. at 192. Thus, the statute plainly means an insurer
takes adverse action if the insurer makes greater (i.e., larger) the
price demanded for insurance.

[An insurer cannot \"make greater\" something that did not exist
previously]{.underline}. The statutory definition of adverse action,
therefore, clearly anticipates an insurer must have made an initial
charge or demand for payment before the insurer can increase that
charge. In other words, an insurer cannot increase the charge for
insurance unless the insurer previously set and demanded payment of the
premium for that insured\'s insurance \[\*\*23\] coverage at a lower
price.

Also related to the waiver issue is appellees\' defense relying on a
provision of the insurance policy that suspends coverage where the risk
is increased by any means within the knowledge or control of the
insured. However, [the term \"increase\" connotes change. To show
change, appellees would have been required to present evidence of the
condition of the building at the time the policy was
issued]{.underline}. See 5 J. Appleman & J. Appleman, Insurance Law and
Practice, § 2941 at 4-5 (1970). [Because no such evidence was presented,
this court cannot determine]{.underline}, on this record, [whether the
risk has, in fact, been increased.]{.underline} Indeed, the answer to
this question may depend on Mr. Glassley\'s knowledge of the condition
of the building at the time the policy was issued, see 17 J. Appleman &
J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 9602 at 515-16 (1981), since
the fundamental issue is whether the appellees contemplated insuring the
risk which incurred the loss.

CONCLUSION\
Because the consideration of written communication is the cornerstone of
the judicial process, the technique involved in that consideration has
intrigued the ages. That technique, [judicial
interpretation]{.underline}, \[\*434\]  attempts a highly delicate
balance. On the one hand, it [acknowledges the]{.underline} legendary
[imprecision of language. On the other hand, it seeks to glean from that
language the elusive signals of purpose, meaning and intent. A
\"science\" so inexact]{.underline} incessantly [craves]{.underline} a
semblance of [constants \-- conventions assisting to **impose order**
upon understanding]{.underline}.\
Roman law, and subsequently the English common-law system, sought to
appease this insatiable desire by offering up the canons of
construction. [The canons, **fundamental maxims of**]{.underline}
compositional [**meaning**, have proved]{.underline} both vulnerable and
[venerable]{.underline}. Their existence has provided an irresistible
historic target for a labyrinth of denigrating commentary. Yet [the
courts]{.underline}, the construers themselves, [have
claimed]{.underline} the [canons]{.underline} as their own, affording
them [a **determinative role** in]{.underline} judicial
[decisionmaking]{.underline} which transverses the spectrum of
litigation. Accordingly, the [critics are left with little choice but to
concede the canons\']{.underline} existence and [shaping
influence]{.underline}, while pleading for caution in their invocation.\
From the canonical mass, the most popular and powerful maxims of meaning
are perhaps the three here selected for treatment: Noscitur a sociis,
Ejusdem generis and Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. Although
different, the three precepts are also similar \-- they counsel an
analysis of associating what is present with what is to be determined.
[The writer, they presume, meant something by what he expressed; that
expression]{.underline}, or at least a portion of it, they insist,
[offers the **best hope** for resolving]{.underline} the
[ambiguity]{.underline} at hand. As they occasionally broaden,
frequently constrict and sometimes exclude, the maxims operate to propel
the interpreter toward an intent, meaning or purpose that will decide
the controversy.

The Court will not construe this term to have its plain and ordinary
meaning, as Mylan proposes, because the word \"increase,\" \[\*62\]
though it has a plain meaning, must be read in the context of the claims
and specification of the \'997 Patent. [To determine if there has been
an \"increase\"]{.underline} in dynamic capacity, [there **must be**
some **initial** dynamic capacity to which the new dynamic capacity can
be **compared**]{.underline}. This comparator is not within the plain
language of the claim, but it is apparent when the term is read in the
context of the entire patent. As explained, the Court concludes that a
skilled artisan would understand that an \"increase\" in the dynamic
capacity for the protein when using a claimed salt pair would be in
reference to the dynamic capacity of the protein when a single salt is
utilized. However, the Court does not believe that the intrinsic
evidence supports the conclusion that a skilled artisan would
necessarily understand that each salt in the salt pair would be provided
at a lower concentration than a single salt, as Amgen proposes. Thus, an
intermediate construction is warranted. See Exxon Chem. Patents, 64 F.3d
at 1555. For the foregoing reasons, the Court construes \"such that the
dynamic capacity of the column is increased for the protein\" as \"such
that the dynamic capacity of the hydrophobic interaction chromatography
column for the protein that \[\*63\] is achieved by using a combination
of a first salt and a second salt is greater than the dynamic capacity
of the column for the protein that is achieved by using a single salt.\"

**[Before-and-after]{.underline} numbers are necessary to determine
whether an 'increase' has occurred**

Marilyn Jean **Kelly 10**, Judge on the Supreme Court of Michigan,
"Adair v. State", 486 Mich. 468, 7/14/2010, Lexis

MCL 141.422a(4) further provides: \"\'Budget\' means a plan of financial
operation for a given period of time, including an estimate of all
proposed expenditures from the funds of a local unit and the proposed
means of financing the expenditures.\" Thus, [in the case
of]{.underline} a mandated [*increased* activity]{.underline} or
services, [a]{.underline} POUM [plaintiff]{.underline} that has its
claim heard before actual increased expenses have been incurred
[need]{.underline} simply [present evidence explaining how much it is
**currently** spending]{.underline} to perform the service or activity
[and how much extra, i.e., the projected amount of \"increase,\" it
anticipates]{.underline} it will have to spend carrying out the
increased level of service or activity. And in the case of mandated new
activities or services, a plaintiff need only present evidence that it
currently spends no money on the service or \[\*\*\*61\] activity, but
anticipates incurring specific necessary costs that are not de minimis
once the mandate becomes effective. Given that estimates of increased
expenses are ordinarily \[\*510\] quantified in budgets, it is
reasonable to conclude that a witness can summarize and provide a
reasonable estimate of an anticipated increase in necessary costs. 21
Ideally, a POUM claim will be decided before the projected necessary
cost increases become actual increases. But in situations such as the
case at bar, where plaintiff school districts had been complying with
the mandates for several years before trial, actual necessary increased
costs, if they exist, should not be difficult, much less insurmountable,
to establish. [In any event, proof of specific necessary increased
costs, projected or actual, is essential in order to verify the
legitimacy of a]{.underline} POUM [claim]{.underline}. 22

\[FOOTNOTE\]

To be sure, plaintiffs may have established \[\*\*\*62\] that the new
requirements are burdensome and require additional staff time. However,
this is not the equivalent of the considerably more specific, and
rigorous, requirements of our constitution. The majority is mistaken
when it asserts that Const 1963, art 9, § 29 does not suggest that POUM
plaintiffs must prove how much their costs increased. [To reiterate, the
word \"increase\" clearly implies the **necessity** of
**before-and-after numbers**]{.underline}. By providing such numbers, a
POUM plaintiff can satisfy the constitutional requirement that it show
how much its necessary costs have increased.

**[Increase =/= Net Increase]{.underline}**

**"Increase" means [SOLELY]{.underline} to "grow larger"---That excludes
tradeoffs, because it's DISTINCT from "change" or "net increase"**

**Chavez 17**

Opinion by Chavez, Acting P. J., Court of Appeal of California, Second
Appellate District, Division Two, Mallano v. Chiang, 2017 Cal. App.
Unpub. LEXIS 2366

As discussed, during the times relevant to this action, section 68203
provided \[\*13\] for mandatory annual increases in judicial salaries by
\"the amount that is produced by multiplying the then current salary of
each justice or judge by the average percentage salary increase for the
current fiscal year for California state employees.\" (§ 68203, subd.
(a).) Defendants contend the phrase \"average percentage salary increase
for the current fiscal year for California State employees\" as used in
section 68203 must be construed to include not only salary increases but
also effective salary decreases caused by mandatory furloughs imposed
during fiscal years 2008-2009 through 2011-2012.

A. The plain language of section 68203 does not support defendants\'
interpretation

Defendants\' interpretation is inconsistent with the plain language of
the statute. \"[The plain meaning of **\'increase\'** is to **grow
larger** in size or amount.]{.underline} \[Citation.\]\" (Guillen v.
Schwarzenegger (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 929, 940, 55 Cal. Rptr. 3d 87;
Mirriam-Webster online dict.,
\<https://www.mirriam-webster.com/dictionary/increase\>.) \"[When a
statute refers to an \'increase\' occurring \'\[i\]n any]{.underline}
fiscal [year\' \[]{.underline}citation[\], it is logical to construe
\'increase\' as meaning an increase **over the previous
year**]{.underline}.\" (Guillen, at p. 940.) The plain meaning of the
words \"salary increase\" as used in section 68203, subdivision (a) is
the amount by which a salary is made larger.

As the trial court noted in its statement of decision, [when the
Legislature has \[\*14\] **intended** to use]{.underline} the phrase
increase or decrease, or [terms that denote deductions or decreases,
such as **net increase**, or **change**, it has **clearly done
so**.]{.underline} (See, e.g., § 31870.01, subd. (a) \[county employees
retirement benefits shall be \"increased or decreased to nearest
one-tenth of 1 percent, by 40 percent of the annual increase or decrease
in the cost-of-living as of January 1st of each year\" (italics
added)\]; Welf. & Inst. Code, § 7289.1, subd. (b) \[\"for computation of
the percentage change in the cost of living . . . \[t\]he product of any
percentage increase or decrease in the average index and the amount set
forth in Section 7289 shall be the adjusted amount\" (italics added)\];
§ 12406 \[\"Appointments to these exempt positions shall not result in
any net increase in the expenditures of the Controller\" (italics
added)\].) Section 68203, [subdivision (a) does not include such
terms.]{.underline}

Subdivision (a) of section 68203 includes an express proviso limiting
judicial salary increases: \"\[I\]n any fiscal year in which the
Legislature places a dollar limitation on salary increases for state
employees the same limitation shall apply to judges in the same manner
applicable to state employees in comparable wage categories.\" There is
no similar provision limiting judicial salary increases during fiscal
years in which state employee salaries are effectively \[\*15\]
decreased, and we decline to read one into the statute. (California
Teachers Assn v. San Diego Community College Dist. (1981) 28 Cal.3d 692,
698, 170 Cal. Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856 \[[if words]{.underline} of the
statute [are **clear**, the court **should not add to or alter them** to
accomplish a purpose that does not appear **on the face** of the
statute\].)]{.underline}

The language of subdivision (b) of section 68203 further reinforces the
interpretation that \"average percentage salary increase\" as used in
subdivision (a) includes only salary increases, and not decreases.
Subdivision (b) states: \"For the purposes of this section, salary
increases for state employees shall be those increases as reported by
\[CalHR\].\" Subdivision (b) refers only to salary increases, and it
identifies CalHR as the source of information for such increases. It
does not mention salary decreases, nor does it identify CalHR or any
other agency as the source of information for salary decreases.
Subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 68203, read together, unambiguously
provide that only state employee salary increases reported by CalHR are
to be considered in calculating judicial salary increases.

B. The legislative history does not support defendants\' interpretation

[Defendants urge us to reject the **plain meaning** of the word
\"increase]{.underline}\" as used in section 68203 based on the
statute\'s legislative history, which they claim evinces an \[\*16\]
intent to tie judicial salary increases to the percentage salary
increase, if any, from the average of all state employees, and not just
those few employees whose salaries were increased. They rely on an
analysis prepared by the Assembly Committee on the Judiciary in
connection with a 1979 amendment to the statute:6Link to the text of the
note

\"SB 53 changes the method of granting judges\' annual salary increases
by tying the increase to the annual average salary increases granted to
California State employees up to a maximum of 5%. Thus, if the average
salary increase received by state employees is 3%, the judges would be
entitled to a 3% increase. If state employees do not receive an increase
in any year, the judges would not be entitled to an increase for that
year. \[¶\] . . . \[¶\] By providing that judges would receive the same
pay hikes as state workers . . . SB 53 presents an equitable alternative
to the annual pay increases judges now receive.\"

(Assem. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 53 (1979-1980 Reg.
Sess.).)

There is **[nothing]{.underline}** in the legislative history that
[indicates that]{.underline} the average percentage salary
[increase]{.underline} for state employees in any given fiscal year [was
intended to include effective]{.underline} salary \[\*17\]
**[decreases]{.underline}** [**as well as** increases]{.underline}. The
analysis cited by defendants simply states that judges are not entitled
to a salary increase in any year in which state employees do not receive
an increase. CalHR calculated a 0.00 percent average percentage salary
increase for state employees in fiscal years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013,
and plaintiffs do not dispute that they were not entitled to any salary
increase in those years.

**[Increase =/= Change]{.underline}**

**'Increase' can't mean change, because that would include its antonym,
'decrease'**

Donna S. **Shroud 18**, Judge on the North Carolina Appeals Court, "City
of Charlotte v. Univ. Fin. Props., LLC", 818 S.E.2d 116, 7/3/2018, Lexis

The language in the statute is clear --- the condemnor may amend its
complaint and notice of taking and may increase \[\*\*33\] the deposit,
but it may not amend a deposit to decrease the amount. [We cannot read
the word \"increase\" to mean \"change\" since a change could include a
\"decrease.\" Increase is the **opposite** of decrease. We construe the
statute using its plain meaning]{.underline}. See Wilkie, 370 N.C. at
547, 809 S.E.2d at 858. And HN22 the statute plainly allows the
condemnor only to increase its deposit \"at any time while the
proceeding is pending\[.\]\" See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 136-103(d). In
addition, the next phrase gives the landowner \"the same rights of
withdrawal of this additional amount\" as it had for the initial
deposit. Id. The statute contemplates only an increase in the deposit
and provides for the landowner to withdraw the additional amount. Id.
There is no provision for a decrease in the deposit while the action is
pending. And as discussed above, the action is no longer \"pending\"
after defendant\'s filing of a voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a).
Thus, the existence of a deposit does not change the result under Rule
41(a) in this case. Even if we assume that a deposit could be increased
after a landowner takes a voluntary dismissal --- although we cannot
imagine \[\*129\] why that would ever happen --- the statute does not
allow an amendment to decrease the deposit at all, so plaintiff\'s
motion here to decrease \[\*\*34\] the deposit does not change our
analysis of the Rule 41(a) dismissal issue.

Louis **Philips 2**, United States Bankruptcy Judge, IN RE Lawrence d.
Goldberg, Debtor; Dwayne M. Murray, Trustee, Plaintiff versus Mae M.
Stacy Trust and F. Eugene Richardson, Defendants, 5/1, lexis) (emphasis
in the original)

In determining the plain meaning of the phrase \"increases the
obligor\'s insolvency,\" the Court initially notes that this phrase
makes no reference whatsoever \[\*\*50\] to a \"reasonably equivalent
value\" test 26 or even to the \"fair consideration\" test of the
Section 3 of the UFCA. 27 Instead, Article 2036 of the Civil Code merely
uses the word \"increases,\" and the absence of \"reasonably equivalent
value\" language or \"fair consideration\" language rings loudly in the
Court\'s judicial ear. Accordingly, [the Court will focus on the plain
meaning of the term \"increases.\" Taking note from one of the
dictionaries of choice of the United States Supreme Court]{.underline},
28 the Court finds that the definition of [the word
\"increase\"]{.underline} in Webster\'s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary
[reads as follows]{.underline}:

\[\*270\] [To become ***progressively*** greater]{.underline} (as in
size, amount, number, or intensity). . . . to make greater: AUGMENT. . .
. INCREASE, ENLARGE, AUGMENT, MULTIPLY mean to make or become greater.
INCREASE used intransitively implies *progressive* growth in size,
amount, intensity; used transitively it may imply simple not necessarily
progressive addition. . . ***[the act or process of
increasing]{.underline}***: as . . . addition or enlargement in size,
extent, quantity.

Webster\'s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 611 (1990) (emphasis added).

As Webster\'s Dictionary states, [the word \"increase\" means a
progressive growth]{.underline}, that is, an incremental \[\*\*52\]
growth. Such progressive and incremental growth implies that when
Article 2036 was drafted, the codifiers used the simple and
easily-understood word \"increase\" because they meant to imply a
\"dollar-for-dollar\" increase in the obligor\'s insolvency, rather than
a \"reasonably equivalent value\" increase. Otherwise, the codifiers
would not have chosen to use the word \"increase\" with no obvious
limitation on its meaning. Moreover, since Article 2036 was crafted in
1984, well after the UFCA, which was enacted in 1918, the drafters of
Article 2036 must have been well aware of the \"fair consideration\"
requirement in Section 3 of the UFCA, and chose not to adopt such a
limitation. Therefore, the Court may reasonably conclude that HN19Go to
this Headnote in the case.the plain meaning of \"increases the
obligor\'s insolvency\" means a \"dollar-for-dollar,\" incremental
growth, rather than insolvency as measured by a \"reasonably equivalent
value\" standard.

As of this stopping place, the Court has performed its task under the
Louisiana Civil Code: to ferret out the plain meaning of Article 2036 of
the Louisiana Civil Code from the words of the article, itself, if
possible. However, the Court will resort to other modes of statutory
construction \[\*\*53\] in support of its \"plain meaning\" analysis,
primarily to assure ourselves that the apparently groundless arguments
of the defendants really are so.. Positing for argument purposes only
(of course) that the phrase \"increases the obligor\'s insolvency\" is
susceptible of more than one meaning (i.e., a \"reasonably equivalent
value\" meaning), analysis of the purpose of the Louisiana revocatory
action and of its legislative history is now offered.

AT&T also argues that Merger Commitment 7.4 only permits extension of
"any given" interconnection agreement for a single three year term. AT&T
Brief at 12. Specifically, AT&T asserts that because Cricket adopted the
interconnection agreement between Sprint and AT&T, which itself was
extended, Cricket is precluded from extending the term of its agreement
with AT&T. Id

This argument relies upon an inaccurate assumption: that the agreement
(contract) between Sprint and AT&T, and the agreement (contract) between
Cricket and AT&T, are one and the same. In other words, to accept AT&T's
argument the Commission must conclude that two separate contracts, i.e.
the interconnection between Sprint and AT&T in Kentucky ("Sprint
Kentucky Agreement") and the interconnection between Cricket and AT&T in
Kentucky ("Cricket Kentucky Agreement"), are one and the same.

Upon this unstated (and inaccurate) premise AT&T asserts that "*the ICA*
was already extended"; id. at 14, and "*the ICA* Cricket seeks to extend
was extended by Sprint . . . ."; id. at 15, and, finally, "Cricket
cannot extend *the same ICA* a second time . . . ." Id. (emphasis added
in all). Note that in the quoted portions of the AT&T brief (and
elsewhere) [AT&T uses vague and imprecise language]{.underline} when
referring to either the Sprint Kentucky Agreement, or the Cricket
Kentucky Agreement, i[n hopes that the Commission will treat the two
contracts as one and the same]{.underline}.

But it would be a mistake to do so. The contract governing AT&T's duties
and obligations with Sprint is a legally distinct and separate contract
from that which governs AT&T's duties with Cricket. The Sprint Kentucky
Agreement was approved by the Commission in September of 2001 in Case
Number 2000-00480. The Cricket Kentucky Agreement was approved by the
Commission in September of 2008 in Case Number 2008-033 1.

[AT&T ignores the fact that these are two separate and distinct
contracts because it knows that the merger commitments apply to *each*
agreement]{.underline} that an individual telecommunications carrier has
with AT&T. Notably, Merger Commitment 7.4 states that "AT&T/BellSouth
ILECs shall permit *a requesting telecommunications carrier* to extend
*its* current interconnection agreement . . . . As written, [the
commitment allows any carrier to extend "*its*" agreement]{.underline}.
Clearly, [the use of the pronoun "its" in this context is possessive,
such that the term "its" means - *that* particular carrier's
agreement]{.underline} with AT&T ([and **not any other carrier's
agreement**]{.underline}). Thus, the merger commitment applies to each
agreement that an individual carrier may have with AT&T. It necessarily
follows then, that Cricket's right to extend its agreement under Merger
Commitment 7.4 is separate and distinct right from another carrier's
right to extend its agreement with AT&T (or whether such agreement has
been extended).

In support of this contention appellant again argues that when any
ambiguity exists in a will it is the duty of the court to construe the
will under guidance of the presumption that the testatrix intended her
property to go to her next of kin, unless there is a strong intention to
the contrary. Again we say, there is intrinsic proof of a  \[\*1074\] 
strong intention to the contrary. In the first place, testatrix only
named two of her blood relatives in the will and had she
desired \[\*\*\*37\]  them to take the residuary estate she doubtless
would have mentioned them by name in the residuary clause. In the second
place, if she used the word \"heirs\" in the sense of blood relatives
she certainly would have dispelled all ambiguity by stating whose blood
relatives were intended. Not only had  \[\*\*53\]  she taken pains in
the will to identify her own two blood relatives but she had also
identified certain blood relatives of her deceased husband. [Had it been
her intention to vest the residuary estate in her blood relatives
**solely**, she would certainly have used the **possessive pronoun**
\"my\" instead of the indefinite article \"the\"]{.underline} in the
clause, \"the above heirs.\"its is geographical.

On its face, the written instrument granting easement rights in this
case is ambiguous. The same sentence which refers to the right to lay a
14 inch pipeline (singular) has a later reference to \"said lines\"
(plural). The use of the plural \"lines\" makes no sense because the
only previous reference has been to a \"line\" (singular). [The writing
is]{.underline} additionally [ambiguous because]{.underline} other key
words which are \"also may change the size of its pipes\" are dangling
in that [the possessive pronoun \"its\"]{.underline} before the word
\"pipes\" [does not have any **subject preceding**, to which the
possessive pronoun refers]{.underline}. The dangling phrase is the
beginning of a sentence, the first word of which does not begin with a
capital letter as is customary in normal English \[\*\*\*10\]  usage.
Immediately preceding the \"sentence\" which does not begin with a
capital letter, there appears a dangling  \[\*236\]  semicolon which
makes no sense at the beginning of a sentence and can hardly relate to
the preceding sentence which is already properly punctuated by a closing
period. [The above deviations from accepted grammatical usage **make
difficult, if not impossible, a clear understanding** of the words used

concerning the meaning of a disputed phrase in the instrument which

**[op]{.underline}**eration**[s]{.underline}**.30 [It also refers
to]{.underline} the **[planning]{.underline}** process DOD organizations
use [to implement these activities]{.underline}.

In essence, the Security Cooperation planning process is a systematic
method for translating strategic guidance into programmatic objectives.
The Office of the Secretary of Defense issues annual Security
Cooperation Guidance (OSD SCG) to guide the planning and activities of
Unified and Specified Commands, the military services, and other DOD
agencies and actors.31 The SCG promulgates strategic objectives based on
security themes derived from the National Security and Defense
strategies. It also provides regional and country priorities,
objectives, and measures of effectiveness for assessment.32 The Unified
and Specified Commands, the services, and other DOD players develop
subordinate plans to execute Security Cooperation activities in support
of OSD's objectives. The Unified Commands, for example, develop regional
strategies and country plans to guide the implementation of security
cooperation activities in their Areas of Operation.33

It is an oft-repeated mantra that in order to defeat transnational
terrorism, and by extension other related non-state threats, the United
States must apply all the elements of national power, including
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.34 The OSD SCG directs
that DOD Security Cooperation "will be integrated with other elements of
national power...in order to achieve national security, defense, and
foreign policy objectives."35 This formulation, while helpful, obscures
two key facts. First, [Security Cooperation includes activities that
**by their very nature**]{.underline} [involve the simultaneous
application of]{.underline} **[more than one element]{.underline}** [of
national power. Security Cooperation at a]{.underline}
**[minimum]{.underline}** [requires the combination of]{.underline}
**[diplomatic]{.underline}** [relations,]{.underline}

Cooperation]{.underline}**:

[This]{.underline} **[expanded]{.underline}** [definition of Security
Cooperation will help us to see]{.underline} **[how the USG may leverage
its programs and activities]{.underline}** to fight terrorism and
related non-state threats.

The role of Security Cooperation in countering non-state threats is
clearly reflected in U.S. strategy. The NSS states that the U.S. will
cooperate with nations to counter terrorism and WMD proliferation,
assisting those that are willing but unable, and persuading those that
are able but not willing.39 The National Military Strategy (NMS)
develops the concept of forward defense, or "Countering Threats Close to
Their Source."40 This is the recognition that the United States' first
line of defense is abroad, and that it is necessary to "patrol strategic
approaches" and extend U.S. defensive capabilities beyond our borders to
create an active "defense in depth."41 In this context, Security
Cooperation is best understood as a set of tools that can shape the
strategic battlespace by creating the conditions necessary to accomplish
U.S. security and defense objectives.42 As the NMS's focus on forward
defense indicates, these activities are by their nature anticipatory,
preparatory, and defensive.43 They are best used as part of a long-term
comprehensive strategy to put in place the relationships, capabilities,
information and intelligence, and access to facilitate future offensive
and defensive actions to counter non-state, as well as more traditional,
threats.

Security Cooperation Goals

Before turning to a detailed discussion of the contribution that
Security Cooperation can make to fighting non-state threats, let's
briefly examine [the]{.underline} four **[main goals]{.underline}** [of
security cooperation]{.underline} [in]{.underline} **[that
context]{.underline}**.

Relationships

Fighting strategic criminals will [require the **cooperation**
of]{.underline} a variety of **[governments]{.underline}**, including
those outside our established alliance relationships. We are not capable
of compelling the kind of "willing and competent cooperation" that we
need.44 Security cooperation provides powerful tools to persuade foreign
governments [to work with the U.S. in support]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[common objectives]{.underline}**. [Senior U.S.
commanders]{.underline}, notably current and former Geographic Combatant
Commanders, [regularly stress the critical contribution that Security
Cooperation activities make to building]{.underline} the kinds of
[relationships]{.underline} with foreign leaders that set the stage for
successful U.S. operations. The example most often cited is the role
that US Central Command (CENTCOM) Security Cooperation activities played
in persuading Central Asian leaders, notably in Uzbekistan and
Kyrgyzstan, to support U.S. military operations in Afghanistan by
granting access to bases and overflight rights.45 In addition to
granting access, good relationships aid in building a common threat
perception, which is a necessary precondition for any substantial
cooperation. Relationships with foreign defense leaders can also provide
the U.S. with influence over the policy direction of key partner states,
including efforts at defense reform and the shape of force structure
changes. Finally, good relationships make it more likely that foreign
governments will share information with the U.S., including, in the
extreme case, early warning of potential attack.46

Intelligence and Information Sharing

Relationships built on trust and mutual interests are also necessary to
obtain cooperation from foreign governments in the area of Intelligence
and Information. It is useful to separate the distinct, but related,
issues of Intelligence Sharing and Intelligence Security Cooperation.
Intelligence Sharing is a critical element in the fight against
non-state threats, or strategic crime. By its nature, however, such
sharing involves sensitive sources, methods and arrangements, normally
in the context of a bilateral relationship. Its sensitivity requires
delicate handling in highly restrictive channels. Intelligence sharing,
in practice, falls outside the scope of Security Cooperation.
Intelligence Security Cooperation, on the other hand, involves the
development of interoperable and cooperative intelligence systems and
processes designed to enhance the ability of one partner to work with
one or several other partners. The core activities in Intelligence
Security Cooperation are analytical and expertise exchanges,
familiarization, training, and traditional Security Assistance. Both
Intelligence Sharing and Intelligence Security Cooperation are mutually
supporting. It is clear that the quality and reliability of intelligence
we get from our partners depends on the competence, capability,
professionalism, and trustworthiness of their national intelligence
services and how compatible their operations are with ours. Intelligence
Security Cooperation provides the tools to develop long-range
relationships with foreign partners to improve both the quality of the
intelligence we share and our ability to work together.

Access

The National Defense Strategy stresses the requirement to secure
strategic access and retain global freedom of action for U.S. forces.47
This includes obtaining permanent and deployment basing and overflight.
Security Cooperation directly supports access by developing
relationships with foreign partners based on trust and mutual interests.
Senior officer and other official visits contribute to this by
demonstrating U.S. commitment to a defense relationship and staying
abreast of host nation priorities, concerns, and requirements. Some
[Security Cooperation activities directly support access by improving
host nation infrastructure, notably airbases, ports, and troop
facilities, to support U.S. forces during operational and training
deployments]{.underline}. Other activities improve host nation
capabilities through training, equipping, and exercises. The NMS
recognizes that access has an informational dimension that goes beyond
the purely physical access to a partner's territory, facilities or
airspace:

> "...theater security activities with multinational partners provide
> access to information and intelligence critical to anticipating and
> understanding new threats."48

This insight is important in determining the contribution Security
Cooperation can make to countering non-state threats. While DOD and the
military services remain understandably focused on the physical
dimension of access and its support to current and future operations,
the fight against strategic criminals requires that we pay greater
attention to securing strategic access to information and information
networks controlled by our partners, allies, and adversaries. In some
cases "virtual access" to databases, data flows, raw and finished
intelligence, sensor data, and other forms of information may be more
critical to the success of military operations than the ability to
access an airfield, port or overflight corridor. Security Cooperation
tools can also support the attainment of this non-traditional form of
access.

Capabilities Development as the Core Activity

> "\...merely coordinating the existing capabilities of the United
> States to counter catastrophic terrorism is not adequate\..."49

In this author's view, the goal of developing allied and friendly
military capabilities for selfdefense and coalition operations is the
first among equals of the four Security Cooperation goals.50 The
sophisticated nature of the network of non-state threats compels us to
recognize that the national security of the United States may very well
depend on the capabilities of our partners and allies every bit as much
as on our own. It is no exaggeration to say that the competence,
professionalism, and honesty of a border guard in Georgia or Kazakhstan
may be more important to the goal of keeping WMD out of the hands of
terrorists, than the effectiveness of any U.S. organization or
surveillance regime. The U.S. has a direct interest in ensuring that its
partners and allies have "the military law enforcement, political, and
financial tools" to fight terrorists and other strategic criminals.51
The National Strategy for Combating Terrorism notes that, "constructive
engagement, with sustained diplomacy and targeted assistance will be
used to persuade...regimes to become more willing, and eventually able,
to meet their international obligations to combat terrorism (emphasis
added)."52 Increasing partner capabilities is the central task of
Security Cooperation.53

The centrality of capability-building in Security Cooperation is due, in
part, to the nature of the tools themselves. Most DOD and other Security
Cooperation programs or tools aim at increasing the capability of our
partners and allies to rise to U.S. standards and/or to develop systems,
tactics, techniques, and procedures that are compatible or interoperable
with ours. Traditional Security Assistance (FMF/FMS, IMET, etc.)
provides foreign partners with equipment, training, advice, and
education that directly support military reform and modernization.
Exercises develop the ability of partners to work with the U.S. and with
one another. Military contact programs provide U.S. policy advice,
support defense reform, and assist in harmonizing threat perceptions and
security or defense doctrines. Other assistance programs provide
humanitarian assistance to support civil-military relations and furnish
material assistance. Targeted programs support the development and/or
improvement of counter-terrorism, counter-drug, and
counter-proliferation regimes. Put simply, developing partner
capabilities is what Security Cooperation does best.

Developing partner capabilities directly supports the other three
Security Cooperation goals as well. The willingness to focus policy
attention and devote resources to develop partner capabilities may be a
powerful incentive for foreign nations to cooperate with U.S. goals and
policies. There is no better way to establish a stable relationship with
a partner than to work with that partner to establish or improve a key
component of its own security infrastructure. Partners will be more
likely to share intelligence and information with the United States if
they perceive that the U.S. is willing to assist in the modernization of
their national security establishments. As noted above, direct
investments in the intelligence capabilities of a partner through
Intelligence Security Cooperation will result in more reliable and
higher quality intelligence obtained in intelligence sharing
arrangements. Capability-building supports access both indirectly and
directly. For example, developing partner capabilities builds the
goodwill and trust necessary for a foreign country to agree to allow the
U.S. to use its airspace, transportation infrastructure, or facilities
(indirectly); and it may be necessary to assist a partner in improving
its host nation support capabilities to support U.S. presence or transit
(directly).

Security Cooperation, is a powerful tool, but a limited one. While
Security Cooperation may increase the likelihood that foreign partners
will support overall U.S. policy goals, it cannot guarantee such broad
support and may be more suited to attaining specific, more narrowly
construed objectives. There is little direct evidence that a robust
Security Cooperation relationship will ensure foreign nation support for
major U.S. policy decisions.54 The decision of countries such as Germany
and Turkey not to support the U.S. invasion of Iraq demonstrates that
other strategic or political factors may outweigh even extensive and
longstanding defense and security relationships. While garnering support
for major policy initiatives like Operation Iraqi Freedom must remain an
objective of Security Cooperation activities, it may be more productive
to focus on specific, critical objectives that directly support U.S.
security in other ways. While formal allies and other close partners may
be willing to follow the U.S. lead on strategic matters, other countries
require more direct incentives to cooperate with the U.S. security
agenda. For example, during the late 1990's NATO aspirant countries
seeking U.S. support for entry into the alliance were highly receptive
to U.S. advice on everything from force structure to foreign policy. The
incentive of alliance membership obviated the need for more specific
incentives to implement policies that met U.S. approval. Many current
partners, such as in the Caucasus and Central, South, and Southwest Asia
have no prospects, or desires, for near-term entry into a defense
alliance with the U.S. and will likely need more targeted inducements to
support U.S. policy objectives.

A focus on building partner capabilities for their own sakes, therefore,
may be more likely to yield definable and measurable benefits than a
focus on broader policy goals. A direct offer of U S. assistance to
develop a partner capability is highly likely to result in agreement
with specific U.S. objectives tied to that capability. For example, a
partner is more likely to agree to share data on foreign cargo traffic
if it has received direct U.S. assistance in improving its capability to
track foreign maritime traffic. In fact, investing in partner
capabilities lends itself very well to this quid pro quo approach. This
method works best when the USG identifies specific capabilities that
fulfill partners' security requirements and specific "payoffs" it seeks
from that investment. This is more likely to net tangible, reliable,
routine cooperation from partners than a less targeted approach.

Focusing on building partner capabilities will also support wider public
diplomacy objectives. A key task for the U.S. is to build broad support
for U.S. security policies among foreign publics and opinion leaders.
Foreign governments and citizens will only support U.S. policies,
initiatives, and (where applicable) presence, if they perceive the U.S.
supports the security, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of their
countries. In this, actions speak louder than words. An effective
strategy will include a focus on building the kinds of capabilities,
such as crisis response and consequence management or anti-trafficking,
that demonstrate U.S. concern for foreign public safety, in addition to
more traditional military or security structures. As we will see below,
these capabilities are critical to the struggle against strategic crime.
The U.S. willingness to invest in foreign partners' security also helps
to counter foreign fears that the U.S. is a "hyperpower" pursuing its
foreign policy and security objectives without concern for other
nations' interests.

As we have seen, Security Cooperation provides the USG with powerful
tools to enable partners to meet their obligations to contribute to the
global struggle against our common adversaries. The next section
explores how we should apply these tools in light of our understanding
of the threats we face.

A Network of Friendly States

> "To be effective, the United States will need to build its own
> international network to combat international terrorist networks."55

The United States needs a sophisticated strategy to deal with the
complex and dangerous threat environment posed by terrorists and other
strategic criminals.56 The international component of this strategy must
look beyond established alliances, bilateral relationships, and limited
regional partnerships to construct a "powerful coalition of nations
maintaining a strong, united international front..."57 Such a strategy
must be holistic, recognizing the interconnected nature of the non-state
threats we face.

Our current strategic approach to non-state threats does not entirely
meet this test. First, rather than having a comprehensive strategy to
deal with the disorder, lawlessness, and insecurity caused by strategic
crime, we have a series of potentially complementary strategies for
counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, counter-narcotics, and
Homeland Security. Second, because each of these strategies is
associated with a separate bureaucracy, funding stream, and set of
organizational priorities, the result is a fragmented effort and de
facto competition for policy attention and resources (We will return to
this issue in the final section).

As the epigraph to this section states, [the task before
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
to build an]{.underline} **[international network]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[counter]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[opposing]{.underline}** [network of]{.underline} **[strategic
criminals]{.underline}** that plague us and our allies. Phil Williams
states in the preface to Non-State Threats and Future Wars, that the
United States and its allies need to innovate organizationally and
doctrinally, "notably by building new mechanisms for interagency,
inter-service, multi-jurisdictional and transnational cooperation." He
also restates the oft-repeated and generally accepted assertion that
hierarchies have great difficulty in fighting networks, and that it
takes networks to fight networks.58 The building of what this paper will
call a "Network of Friendly States" (NOFS) is a sufficiently complex and
sophisticated strategy to address the threats of transnational terrorism
and related non-state threats.

For such a strategy to be successful, it must meet the criteria for what
has been called a "competitive strategy."59 A competitive strategy is
one that pits allied strengths against adversaries' weaknesses.60 It
must also be long-term, based on enduring strengths, with costs that can
be sustained indefinitely. The chief weakness of strategic criminals is
their need to operate without being detected by competent authority.
This includes the requirement to communicate secretly, organize and
train in safe havens, and move people, money, and things (e.g., weapons)
internationally.61 To do this they use the global transportation and
information infrastructure, as discussed above, and exploit weak or
failing states. Any successful strategy would have to mobilize U.S. and
allied capabilities to prevent strategic criminal networks from
communicating, moving, and hiding free from allied detection.62 The
building of a global network to fight strategic crime is clearly a
long-term effort, and one that would need to be maintained over an
extended period of time (several U.S. presidential administrations, for
example) in order to show appreciable benefits. In order for the costs
of such a strategy to be sustained indefinitely, a high degree of
international cooperation and burden sharing will be required.

A Network of Friendly States implies a more permanent arrangement than a
"coalition of the willing," but does not go as far as suggesting the
establishment of a NATO-style defense alliance on a global scale. The
nature and scope of the international cooperation necessary to wage a
long-term struggle against strategic crime implies complex arrangements
for systematic cooperation and information sharing. This network would
constitute an enduring partnership of like-minded states bound by mutual
interests. To be effective, however, it would need to partially break
out of the typical "state-centric paradigm"63 that characterizes
traditional state-state relationships in the international system. The
network paradigm captures the interdependence of international partners
and the overlapping security concerns presented by the threat of
strategic crime to global order and international peace and security.
The network concept provides for and depends on U.S. leadership, but
does not require U.S. orchestration or domination. Rather, it relies on
broad and voluntary support, thereby distributing risks and burdens
among the network's members. According to Leon Fuerth, "American policy
must be directed toward creating a sense of commonwealth and collective
responsibility for its management with other democracies."64

[A **comprehensive** USG Security Cooperation effort]{.underline}, using
the foreign assistance resources of the entire USG, [could enable
a]{.underline} **[global Network of Friendly States]{.underline}** [by
providing]{.underline} its [members a system of]{.underline}
**[incentives]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} fulfill their obligations
and **[cooperate]{.underline}** with one another. The following section
will explore in greater detail the desirable characteristics of a
Network of Friendly States. At a minimum, it is clear that the
willingness to share information and cooperate in the detection,
interdiction, apprehension, or neutralization of strategic criminals
should be the non-negotiable price of membership in this network. The
willingness to give token political support to U.S. policy, or even
support of discrete U.S. efforts such as Operations Enduring Freedom or
Iraqi Freedom, should not be sufficient to enjoy the benefits of
membership in a truly global network to fight strategic crime. It is an
open question whether countries that refuse to cooperate fully in
fighting strategic crime deserve to be called allies in the global
coalition against terrorism.65 Our Security Cooperation tools and
programs give us a way simultaneously to reward those who cooperate66
and to build up the overall capabilities of the network.

Deﬁning Security Cooperation

[Security cooperation refers to **all D**]{.underline}epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense
[interactions]{.underline} that are [carried out with foreign militaries
and defense establishments]{.underline}.21 [Security cooperation is "the
**ability for DOD to interact with foreign defense
establishments**]{.underline} [to build defense relationships that
promote specific U.S. security interests]{.underline}, develop allied
and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and coalition
operations, includ- ing allied transformation, improve information
exchange, and intelligence shar- ing to help harmonize views on security
challenges, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
access and en route infrastructure."22 Security cooperation falls under
the purview of the overall geographic combatant commander, but his
strategy and activities are executed at the country level through his
secu- rity assistance officer, who is the combatant commanders' direct
in-country rep- resentative and is a member of the country team at the
U.S. Embassy working for the U.S. ambassador. Although not in all
countries, the security assistance officer is one of the ambassador's
favorite staff members since military assistance pro- grams can create
secure environments for development programs.

The overall goals of security assistance include creating favorable
military bal- ances of power (e.g., selling weapons and training to
Saudi Arabia to balance Iran), advancing areas of mutual defense or
security arrangements (e.g., collaborating with Japan on missile defense
technology), building allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations (e.g., training Georgian
forces, the third-largest troop contributor in Iraq in 2008), and
preventing crisis and conflict (e.g., facilitating Colombia's success
against the decades-old Revolu- tionary Armed Forces of Colombia
\[FARC\] insurgency). As noted in doctrine, there are six categories of
security cooperation activity: military contacts, includ- ing senior
official visits, counterpart visits, conferences, staff talks, and
personnel and unit exchange programs; nation assistance, including
foreign internal defense, security assistance programs, and planned
humanitarian and civic assistance activ- ities; multinational training;
multinational exercises; multinational education; and arms control and
treaty monitoring activities.23 [Underlying all of these activities is
the clear **intent to achieve U.S. national security
objectives**]{.underline}. It is important to remember that states must
manage the risks of abandonment and entrapment by its friends and
allies.24 The United States does this by building a partner country's
military and developing professional relationships across militaries.

These activities are increasingly enshrined in doctrine and are defined
as "the ability to improve the military capabilities of our allies and
partners to help them transform and optimize their forces to provide
regional security, disaster pre- paredness and niche capabilities in a
coalition."25 For example, Commander Naval Forces Europe has been
developing a capability for maritime domain awareness throughout Europe
and Africa and has been working with NATO allies and Afri- can partners
to develop a regional capability to protect trade, natural resources,
and economic development. This work includes establishing maritime
domain awareness through the automated identification system, an array
of coastal radar systems, and through improved command and control of a
naval reaction force. Inherent in these activities is the need to
develop enduring relationships. In the Near East, for example, long-term
relationships have produced trust and access for the United States to
have forward operating bases in Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and
Bahrain. Additionally, weapons are prepositioned in other countries,
including Oman. While partners benefit from these programs, programs
like these also support broader U.S. foreign policy objectives of global
influence.

[Security cooperation]{.underline} **[also]{.underline}** [includes
**security sector reform**]{.underline}, which is an area of increasing
importance. It [focuses on]{.underline} **[improving
c]{.underline}**ivil--**[m]{.underline}**ilitary
**[r]{.underline}**elations, [promoting **collaboration**]{.underline}
among regional partners, and fostering cooperation within partners'
governments. The United States has learned that contemporary [security
challenges often require]{.underline} **[whole-of-government
solutions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} regional **[coop-
eration]{.underline}**. Consequently, [it seeks]{.underline} to foster
[this]{.underline} **[same]{.underline}** [approach]{.underline}
**[around the world]{.underline}**. Programs support legislative reform
(e.g., providing legal advice used to write laws to seize assets from
drug traffickers in Colombia), enhancing cooperation between police and
defense forces (e.g., building bridges among bureaucratic rivals in
Jamaica), and managing the legacy of past human rights abuses by mili-
taries (e.g., integrating human rights training in programs in Latin
America and Africa). Further, it considers the internal health and
welfare of partners' military forces by combating HIV/AIDS in
militaries, promoting noncommissioned officer development, and providing
educational opportunities for officers.

**[Title 22]{.underline}** (Account 150), [the international assistance
budget]{.underline} was \$27.3 billion in FY2009 (see table 5.1).
Fifteen different programs are included in the Account 150, but only six
programs [can be considered **related to security**]{.underline}.

**[\[TABLE 5.1 OMITTED\]]{.underline}**

[These include]{.underline} foreign military financing
(**[FMF]{.underline}**), international military educa- tion and training
(**[IMET]{.underline}**), international narcotics control and law
enforcement (**[INCLE]{.underline}**), **[peacekeeping]{.underline}**
[operations, the]{.underline} [**Andean Counterdrug Program**,
and]{.underline} **[Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and
related programs]{.underline}**. While security assistance programs are
substantial, nonsecurity assistance programs exceed them by at least two
to one. And there are substantial differences across regions too. In
Africa, for example, nonsecurity programs are the dominant approach to
international assistance. In the Near East, however, the opposite is
true because of military assistance to Egypt and Israel.

In addition to the general missions assigned, some geographic combatant
commanders have specific responsibilities. For example, Southern Command
is responsible for defending the Panama Canal and the surrounding area.
North- ern Command is responsible for homeland defense, supporting civil
authorities, planning for responses to pandemic influenza, and providing
support to partner countries in the event of a catastrophic attack. And
Africa Command is focused on building partners' operational and
institutional capacity with no emphasis placed on fighting wars in
Africa. [Evident in the]{.underline} sixteen [assigned responsibilities
and specific missions]{.underline} listed above [is that]{.underline}
combatant [commands do much more than fight wars. Instead, military
commands support **broader U.S. government efforts during

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Service Chiefs, and the GCC
Subordinate Component Commands are deliberately excluded from the triad
because they are primarily concerned with training, manning, and
equipping forces for global readiness. Focused inward, they all may see
security cooperation activities as vehicles to best execute these tasks,
but they should not be setting the direction for bilateral activities
between states. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency draws attention
that "[the]{.underline} **[broad definition]{.underline}** [of security
cooperation to include]{.underline} **[all]{.underline}** [DOD
international programs... has]{.underline} **[significantly increased
the playing field]{.underline}** [within DOD. Now it

use in achieving U.S. foreign policy and national security
objectives."]{.underline}34 This is a noble goal, but applies to program
execution more than to program design. In practice, the design of
security cooperation engagements remains under the purview of the triad.
Major Combatant Command liaisons to foreign countries, such as the
Army‟s Training and Doctrine Command network, are responsible to
coordinate their activities as part of the Country Team through the
Senior Defense Official. National Guard or Active troops visiting or
training in a foreign country must obtain country clearance approval
from the Geographic Combatant Command and the local American Embassy.
Enough statutory controls exist that it serves to acknowledge the duties

[Security Cooperation is sometimes **confused**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} [**Security Assistance**. The]{.underline}
**[latter]{.underline}** term [falls]{.underline} **[under the
umbrella]{.underline}** [of Security Cooperation, but]{.underline} it
[focuses more on programs such as]{.underline} Foreign Military Finance
(**[FMF]{.underline}**), Foreign Military Sales (**[FMS]{.underline}**),
the International Military Education and Training Program
(**[IMET]{.underline}**), [and other programs authorized by the Foreign
Assistance Act and managed by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.
However, the]{.underline} **[Department of State]{.underline}** [is
responsible for providing policy]{.underline}
**[direction]{.underline}** [for Security Assistance
programs.]{.underline}14

### Includes Arms Sales\-\--'Security Assistance'

#### Security cooperation includes security assistance

Daniel **Mahanty 21**, Director of the US Program for the Center for
Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC), spent 16 years in the US Department of
State, where he created and led the Office of Security and Human Rights,
"Human Rights and Civilian Harm in Security Cooperation: A Framework of
Analysis," in Remote Warfare: Interdisciplinary Perspectives, ed.
Alasdair Mckay, Abigail Watson & Megan Karlshøj-Pedersen, 2021, pp
132-151

[A note on]{.underline} [**terminology**: While]{.underline} [security
cooperation and security assistance have]{.underline}
**[different]{.underline}** [definitions in sources of US Government
guidance]{.underline}, this paper will use [the term 'security
cooperation']{.underline} to **[include]{.underline}** [security
assistance activities]{.underline} for purposes of simplicity.

The case of support to Saudi demonstrates one way in which the United
States Government may encounter a policy obstacle, in the form of public
scrutiny, that results from harmful policies and practices of a partner
over which it has little or no control. But civilian harm and human
rights violations committed by America's partners can also undermine
progress toward the security interests that security cooperation is
intended to achieve in more fundamental ways. For example, human rights
abuses by a partner can counteract joint efforts to counter terrorism by
eroding the public's trust in the legitimacy of the partner state (and
by extension, the United States), or even by increasing the number of
the disaffected who may turn to violence in response to state-sponsored
abuse (UNDP 2017, 5, 80). Meanwhile, providing security assistance in
fragile states, where such harms may be more likely or prevalent, can
also aggravate conflict, undermine stabilization, or counteract
peacebuilding efforts (Kleinfeld 2018, 282--285). Finally, human rights
abuse or civilian harm may be symptomatic of larger institutional
deficits or structural phenomena (e.g. corruption) that greatly diminish
the likelihood that security cooperation will ever achieve its desired
outcomes.

Having a sounder understanding of risks specific to human rights and
civilian harm could, at minimum, allow the US government to optimise the
desired returns on security cooperation with fewer attendant costs. This
chapter sets out a summary of a framework developed by Center for
Civilians in Conflict, by which the US -- and even other states or
institutions -- might assess the human rights and civilian harm risks
involved with undertaking security cooperation activities with
particular partners. It also presents a selection of factors to consider
in the design of the partnership to ensure 'interoperable', i.e.
compatible, approaches to risk mitigation. As such, the US Government
might use the framework in one of three ways: 1) ex ante policy analysis
of its partners to help formulate security cooperation strategies; 2)
ongoing analysis of risks that can be used to head off significant
problems arising from harm or to monitor progress or improvements; and
3) a means of designing and customizing risk mitigation measures
specific to, and appropriate for, partnerships of vastly different
character.

Scope of application

For purposes of this analysis, [security cooperation can include
a]{.underline} **[variety]{.underline}** [of activities along
a]{.underline} [**spectrum of involvement**, from]{.underline}
**[partnered operations]{.underline}** [involving both countries in the
**military**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [**security operations**, to
the]{.underline} [**provision of advice**, **operational**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[logistical support]{.underline}**, **[arms
sales]{.underline}**, and **[training]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[education]{.underline}** (Knowles and Watson 2018, 3). While
[partnership with]{.underline} **[civilian law
enforcement]{.underline}** [may be implicated by this
framework]{.underline}, and certain analytical criteria may apply to
police activities, the analysis is primarily geared toward application
to cooperation between, and with, military forces.

### Excludes Episodic Cooperation

#### Security cooperation must be infrastructural, not episodic\-\--e.g., building up systems for intelligence sharing, rather than individual acts of intelligence sharing

Colonel Albert **Zaccor 5**, 2004-2005 United States Army Senior Fellow
at the Atlantic Council of the United States and is currently Director
for Southern Europe in the Office of the Secretary of Defense,
International Security Policy -- NATO/Europe, "Security Cooperation and
Non-State Threats: A Call for an Integrated Strategy," The Atlantic
Council of the United States, August 2005,
https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/46290/2005_08_Security_Cooperation_and_Non-State_Threats.pdf

It is an oft-repeated mantra that in order to defeat transnational
terrorism, and by extension other related non-state threats, the United
States must apply all the elements of national power, including
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.34 The OSD SCG directs
that DOD Security Cooperation "will be integrated with other elements of
national power...in order to achieve national security, defense, and
foreign policy objectives."35 This formulation, while helpful, obscures
two key facts. First, [Security Cooperation includes activities that
**by their very nature**]{.underline} [involve the simultaneous
application of]{.underline} **[more than one element]{.underline}** [of
national power. Security Cooperation at a]{.underline}
**[minimum]{.underline}** [requires the combination of]{.underline}
**[diplomatic]{.underline}** [relations,]{.underline}
**[military]{.underline}** [assistance,]{.underline}
**[military-to-military]{.underline}** [contacts, **and public
diplomacy**. In other words, Security Cooperation **is
itself**]{.underline} [an application of at least three of the classic
elements of national power]{.underline}.36 [Second, DOD is **not the
only entity in the USG that interacts with foreign governments to
achieve the stated objectives**: relationships, capabilities,
information and intelligence, and access. The]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[S]{.underline}**tate, [the]{.underline}
**[I]{.underline}**ntelligence **[C]{.underline}**ommunity,
[and]{.underline} to a lesser extent, **[other]{.underline}**
[departments]{.underline} and agencies, [conduct activities aimed at the
accomplishment of these objectives, broadly understood. There is,
however,]{.underline} **[no common USG, or interagency, definition or
concept of Security Cooperation]{.underline}**.37 We will return to this
issue in the final section of this paper. For the purposes of the
present discussion, [this paper offers the]{.underline}
**[following]{.underline}** working **[definition of Security
Cooperation]{.underline}**:

> [Security Cooperation refers to]{.underline} **[all USG assistance
> provided to foreign law enforcement, security, and defense
> establishments in support of national defense, security, and foreign
> policy objectives.]{.underline}**38

[This]{.underline} **[expanded]{.underline}** [definition of Security
Cooperation will help us to see]{.underline} **[how the USG may leverage
its programs and activities]{.underline}** to fight terrorism and
related non-state threats.

The role of Security Cooperation in countering non-state threats is
clearly reflected in U.S. strategy. The NSS states that the U.S. will
cooperate with nations to counter terrorism and WMD proliferation,
assisting those that are willing but unable, and persuading those that
are able but not willing.39 The National Military Strategy (NMS)
develops the concept of forward defense, or "Countering Threats Close to
Their Source."40 This is the recognition that the United States' first
line of defense is abroad, and that it is necessary to "patrol strategic
approaches" and extend U.S. defensive capabilities beyond our borders to
create an active "defense in depth."41 In this context, Security
Cooperation is best understood as a set of tools that can shape the
strategic battlespace by creating the conditions necessary to accomplish
U.S. security and defense objectives.42 As the NMS's focus on forward
defense indicates, these activities are by their nature anticipatory,
preparatory, and defensive.43 They are best used as part of a long-term
comprehensive strategy to put in place the relationships, capabilities,
information and intelligence, and access to facilitate future offensive
and defensive actions to counter non-state, as well as more traditional,
threats.

Security Cooperation Goals

Before turning to a detailed discussion of the contribution that
Security Cooperation can make to fighting non-state threats, let's
briefly examine [the]{.underline} four **[main goals]{.underline}** [of
security cooperation]{.underline} [in]{.underline} **[that
context]{.underline}**.

Relationships

Fighting strategic criminals will [require the **cooperation**
of]{.underline} a variety of **[governments]{.underline}**, including
those outside our established alliance relationships. We are not capable
of compelling the kind of "willing and competent cooperation" that we
need.44 Security cooperation provides powerful tools to persuade foreign
governments [to work with the U.S. in support]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[common objectives]{.underline}**. [Senior U.S.
commanders]{.underline}, notably current and former Geographic Combatant
Commanders, [regularly stress the critical contribution that Security
Cooperation activities make to building]{.underline} the kinds of
[relationships]{.underline} with foreign leaders that set the stage for
successful U.S. operations. The example most often cited is the role
that US Central Command (CENTCOM) Security Cooperation activities played
in persuading Central Asian leaders, notably in Uzbekistan and
Kyrgyzstan, to support U.S. military operations in Afghanistan by
granting access to bases and overflight rights.45 In addition to
granting access, good relationships aid in building a common threat
perception, which is a necessary precondition for any substantial
cooperation. Relationships with foreign defense leaders can also provide
the U.S. with influence over the policy direction of key partner states,
including efforts at defense reform and the shape of force structure
changes. Finally, good relationships make it more likely that foreign
governments will share information with the U.S., including, in the
extreme case, early warning of potential attack.46

Intelligence and Information Sharing

Relationships built on trust and mutual interests are also necessary to
obtain cooperation from foreign governments in the area of Intelligence
and Information. It is useful to separate the distinct, but related,
issues of Intelligence Sharing and Intelligence Security Cooperation.
[Intelligence Sharing]{.underline} is a critical element in the fight
against non-state threats, or strategic crime. By its nature, however,
such sharing [involves sensitive sources, methods and
arrangements]{.underline}, normally [in the context of a bilateral
relationship. Its **sensitivity** requires **delicate handling** in
highly **restrictive channels**. Intelligence **sharing**, in practice,
falls]{.underline} [**outside the scope of Security Cooperation**.
Intelligence **Security Cooperation**, on the other hand, involves the
**development** of **interoperable and cooperative intelligence
systems**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[processes]{.underline}**
[designed to enhance the ability of one partner to work with one or
several other partners]{.underline}. The core activities in Intelligence
Security Cooperation are analytical and expertise exchanges,
familiarization, training, and traditional Security Assistance.
[Both]{.underline} **[Intelligence Sharing]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Intelligence Security Cooperation]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} [**mutually supporting**. It is clear that the quality
and reliability of intelligence we get from our partners depends on the
competence, capability, professionalism, and trustworthiness of their
national intelligence services and how compatible their operations are
with ours. Intelligence Security Cooperation provides]{.underline} the
[tools to develop **long-range** relationships with foreign partners to
improve both the quality of the intelligence we share and our ability to
work together]{.underline}.

### Excludes NATO Exercises

#### Reads good but is kinda a nonsense definition

#### Security cooperation is when the US directly partners with country, different than using the NATO architecture to directly do stuff with NATO assets

Background and Need for the Study

[The]{.underline} **[precise use of words]{.underline}** by Department
of Defense officials [is]{.underline} **[critical]{.underline}** [to
formulating]{.underline} and executing [military
strategy]{.underline}.11 [When developing a plan]{.underline} of action,
**[loosely defined]{.underline}** military [**terms** can
affect]{.underline} planners' [abilities to properly
**understand**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[actual
capabilities]{.underline}** [resident in a proposed course of
action]{.underline}.12 In Afghanistan, the
**[misapplication]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} military
[term]{.underline} **[security cooperation]{.underline}** [fostered a
climate that caused the]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense [and]{.underline}
**[State]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[underestimate]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[significant role]{.underline}** [of SC in
fostering]{.underline} the **[diplomatic relationships]{.underline}**
that contribute to international peace and stability.

As a major in the Marine Corps, [I planned]{.underline} and participated
in [a security cooperation exercise with **Estonia**. It
was]{.underline} **[important]{.underline}** to the United States
European combatant commander and the commanding general Estonian Self
Defense Force [that communication]{.underline} with the media
**[specifically]{.underline}** [addressed our operation as a **security
cooperation exercise**. Eighteen countries participated in the exercise,
to include the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} [**Estonia**,
and]{.underline} **[sixteen]{.underline}** other countries [that are
part of]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.underline}**). [However, this exercise]{.underline}, named
BALTIC OPERATIONS, [was **not**]{.underline} officially [**a NATO
exercise**.]{.underline}

[This]{.underline} **[distinction]{.underline}** [between]{.underline}
**[security cooperation]{.underline}** exercise [and]{.underline}
**[NATO exercise]{.underline}** [may]{.underline} **[seem]{.underline}**
[like]{.underline} nothing more than [**semantics**. However
a]{.underline} **[misunderstanding]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the
**[semantic nuances]{.underline}** [had]{.underline} potential
**[negative strategic consequences]{.underline}**. Estonia shares a
border with Russia and former Soviet military forces occupied Estonia
prior to the 1991 Singing Revolution. Diplomatic tensions between
Estonia and Russia remain tense and Estonia is constantly defending its
territorial waters in the Baltic Sea against Russian naval vessels.
[During the exercise a Russian frigate and a Russian submarine attempted
to violate Estonia's territorial water. In response, Estonia deployed a
small portion of its Navy]{.underline} to block the Russian vessels and
force a return to internationally recognized neutral waters shared by
countries bordering the Baltic Sea. [This level of]{.underline}
international [tension]{.underline} between Estonia and Russia [is
constant. If the participants of]{.underline} a **[security
cooperation]{.underline}** exercise [were to]{.underline}
**[describe]{.underline}** [the event as a]{.underline} [**NATO
exercise**, it would be]{.underline} interpreted by Russia as [a signal
that]{.underline} [**NATO forces**, led by the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [were]{.underline}
**[rehearsing]{.underline}** air, land, and sea
**[strategies]{.underline}** in the Baltic Sea that would support an
amphibious assault against the Russian city of St. Petersburg. [This
instance and many others like it demonstrate that the **improper use of
military terminology**]{.underline} can [have]{.underline} unintended
**[negative consequences]{.underline}**.

### Excludes Secret Programs

The 2007 maritime strategy declares that "**[preventing

winning]{.underline}** wars." And the 2008 U.S. Marine Corps Strategy
and Vision notes that "our future Corps will be increasingly reliant on
naval deployment, preventive in approach," to achieve national
objectives.62 In practice, **[preventive]{.underline}** military
[engagements take the form of]{.underline} [**security cooperation**,
which is the ability of militaries to interact together to build defense
relationships that promote specific security interests]{.underline},
develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
coalition operations, [and provide]{.underline} foreign forces
**[peacetime]{.underline}** and contingency [access. These]{.underline}
activities [are in part funded by the State Department]{.underline} to
"promote the principles of democracy, respect for human rights, and the
rule of law."63 Chapters 4 and 5 trace the evolution of the military's
concepts and doctrine to support these operations, but it is worth
exploring how engagement became a central feature of U.S. defense
strategy and policy.

Introduction

Ten years after commencing military operations in Afghanistan, and seven
years after then-President George W. Bush declared, "Mission
accomplished!" from the flight deck of the USS Lincoln, the United
States continues to engage Afghanistan in a long and costly military
operation while simultaneously attempting to withdraw all of it military
forces from the country of Iraq. Billions of dollars have been spent and
thousands of lives have been lost during the Afghan conflict that, as
yet, has no end in sight; and, in recent years, a complex and growing
insurgency has threatened to destabilize reconstruction efforts,
complicating efforts to craft a viable exit strategy.

At the conclusion of combat operations in Iraq, the United States
military experienced significant domestic turmoil in and around the
Sunni Triangle due to the disbanding of the Iraqi military and the
"de-baathification" process that removed essentially all Baath Party
officials loyal to Saddam Hussein. In the wake of massive unemployment
that followed the purging of Baath Party loyalists an insurgency
movement formed and took root as a challenge to the United States
occupation of Iraq. In response to the growing insurgency, the U.S.
military resurrected and re-purposed a doctrine designed to combat
insurgents and gave it the name COIN or counter-insurgency doctrine. One
of the key components to COIN is the civil-military relationship
developed between the host nation and the U.S.; this relationship was
given the label Provincial Reconstruction Teams and anointed as the
process by which the United States would transition civil authority to
the newly developing Iraqi government and gracefully exit the Iraq War.
The strategy of employing Provincial Reconstruction Teams was also
adopted in Afghanistan as the means to achieve military success and set
the stage for the United States to withdraw from Afghanistan.

The self identified requirement of the United States to reconstruct both
Iraq and Afghanistan, after the conclusion of hostilities, as the
precursor to the successful withdraw of military forces, demanded a
strategy capable of meeting these self-imposed restrictions. The Bush
Administration developed and employed a reconstruction plan that used
Provincial Reconstruction Teams as a bridge to re-establish the Iraqi
and Afghan infrastructure destroyed during the invasion and occupation
of both countries. Constitutional limitations prevented the re-election
of President Bush and limited his ability to follow through on the
implementation of his reconstruction plans. President Obama's successful
presidential election was in part linked to his promise of ending the
war in Iraq. As the newly elected leader of the U.S., President Obama
had to distinguish himself from the Bush Administration and one of the
ways he did so was in the development of his 2010 National Security
Strategy.

[The 2010]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**ational
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[S]{.underline}**trategy [adopted the
philosophy of]{.underline} **[defensive liberalism]{.underline}** [to
define the way that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [would attempt to influence international
events. One on the strategies]{.underline} that President Obama
articulated in this document [was]{.underline} [**security
cooperation**; a strategy]{.underline} that was [intended to
**rebuild**]{.underline} the **[damaged infrastructure]{.underline}** of
a country, serve as the means to remove military forces from Iraq, and
establish the conditions necessary to end military operations in
Afghanistan. [Unfortunately the use of security cooperation as
a]{.underline} strategic [tool for]{.underline}
**[reconstruction]{.underline}** that ultimately supports a military
withdraw from post-conflict countries [is in]{.underline} [**direct
contradiction with its doctrinal definition**. Security cooperation **by
definition**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} a strategic military tool
[intended to be used during]{.underline} **[times of
peace]{.underline}** [in an effort to prevent]{.underline}
**[future]{.underline}** [conflict.]{.underline} The **[faulty
terminological use]{.underline}** [of security cooperation to
**describe**]{.underline}d [a U.S.]{.underline} **[exit
strategy]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} the Iraq and Afghan
**[wars]{.underline}** [created a]{.underline} **[false
impression]{.underline}** of what a strategy of security cooperation is
capable of achieving.

[Security cooperation is a compilation of financial, educational, and
material resources, that at their foundation are supported
by]{.underline} the United States, in particular [the]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense, [and]{.underline} are [used to support
the]{.underline} **[peaceful development of democracies]{.underline}**
in foreign countries. The [resources provided by the]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense [are available to foreign countries after the
host nation **requests**]{.underline} the **[peaceful
assistance]{.underline}** of the U.S. military in response to systemic
deficiencies in the bureaucratic management of a nation state or when a
nation state recognizes that its military limitations prevent it from
properly defending its geographic borders. The host nation's request for
support from the U.S. is typically an effort by the foreign country to
develop its internal capacity to protect its people and limit internal
or external threats. The security cooperation exercise Baltic Operation,
held in Estonia, is an example of a foreign country using the resources
provided by the United States to improve its national defense
capabilities in direct response to a perceived threat to its sovereign
borders. In this scenario Estonia is attempting to develop its military
capabilities and project an image of strength in an effort to maintain
the freedom it earned, from Russia, at the conclusion of the Singing
Revolution in 1992 and prevent a future Russian incursion across its
borders. In contrast to this appropriate use and definition of security
cooperation as a strategy to prevent conflict, the Obama Administration
is using the term security cooperation as a way to define a national
exit strategy from a two front war, a strategy that at its heart is
based on the reconstruction of a damaged infrastructure. The false
labeling of reconstruction operations as security cooperation is the
foci of this thesis project.

Statement of the Problem

Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) form the backbone of the
reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. PRTs are composed of U.S.
military, U.S. State Department, and USAID officials who collaborate
with local Afghan leaders to identify and initiate the most needed
reconstruction projects at the provincial level. Current events and
recent literature suggest, however, that policy-makers and military
planners, alike, are struggling to distinguish between security
cooperation and the role of the PRT. The failure to properly
differentiate security cooperation from stability and reconstruction
operations detracts from the capabilities of security cooperation and
limits its capabilities as a tool to promote and maintain peace.2 A
particularly concerning trend is the growing propensity of planners to
conflate the post-hostilities reconstruction role of the PRT with the
pre-hostilities strategy of security cooperation (SC).3 [In an effort to
provide]{.underline} **[clarity]{.underline}** on the subject, Assistant
Secretary of Defense Robert England drafted [a]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense **[directive]{.underline}** that
**[defined]{.underline}** [security cooperation.]{.underline}

> **[security cooperation]{.underline}**. [Activities undertaken
> **by**]{.underline} the **[D]{.underline}**epartment
> **[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense [to encourage and
> enable international partners to work **with the U**]{.underline}nited
> **[S]{.underline}**tates [to **achieve strategic objectives**. It
> includes]{.underline} [**all DoD interactions with foreign defense and
> security establishments**, including]{.underline} **[all
> DoD-administered security assistance programs]{.underline}**, that:
> build defense and security relationships that promote specific U.S.
> security interests, including all international armaments cooperation
> activities and security assistance activities; develop allied and
> friendly military capabilities for self-defense and multinational
> operations; and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
> access to host nations.4

[The directive was published in order to establish a]{.underline}
**[baseline understanding]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[security
cooperation]{.underline}** as a mission. [A]{.underline} **[common
understanding]{.underline}** of Department of Defense expectations [with
regard to security cooperation]{.underline} ideally [would
help]{.underline} planners [use the strategy in ways that
are]{.underline} **[consistent with the official
definition.]{.underline}**

This is an issue that has garnered little attention from those whose job
it is to employ the strategy of SC, primarily because those same
planners are the ones perpetuating the mistake. 5 [The conflation
of]{.underline} **[reconstruction]{.underline}** efforts [with SC
is]{.underline} **[understandable]{.underline}** [given that both are
strategic tools embedded into]{.underline} the medium of [stability
operations]{.underline}. Stability operations is [an overarching term
that spans the breadth of military operations used in]{.underline}
**[peacetime security cooperation]{.underline}** missions,
[crisis]{.underline} **[response]{.underline}** [activities,
and]{.underline} **[combat]{.underline}** [operations]{.underline}.6
Stability operations exist in a variety of forms. The chart below taken
from Joint Publication 3-0, Joint Operations, illustrates the variety of
operational tasks included in stability operations.7

\[FIGURE V-4 OMITTED\]

[A]{.underline} **[broad spectrum]{.underline}** [of operational
environments exists]{.underline} in Afghanistan, ranging from the
relatively friendly provinces of Panjshir and Bamyan where the Taliban
has historically been unwelcome to the Taliban dominated provinces of
Helmand and Ghazni. Operational environments that are peaceful and
stable like Panjshir and Bamyan could support security cooperation
activities if the whole of Afghanistan were at peace. In a stable
environment, it would be appropriate to use security cooperation
activities that reinforce host nation security efforts to minimize
Taliban influence in the region. Provinces such as Helmand and Ghazni,
however, where violent Taliban insurgencies continue to take American
lives in large numbers, are operational environments that are not
conducive to security cooperation and negate the use of SC as a viable
strategy to quell the insurgency.8

[Despite the difficulty]{.underline} of simultaneously managing a
variety of strategies in the complex medium of stability operations,
[planners must]{.underline} **[guard against
misunderstanding]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**misapplying
military strategies**. SC holds **great potential**]{.underline} [as a
tool of military]{.underline} **[diplomacy]{.underline}** that can help
to build trust in international relationships where trust has been at a
deficit.9

[Yet]{.underline} **[lack of understanding]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[misapplication]{.underline}** [of the
term]{.underline} among policy makers and military planners [threatens
to]{.underline} **[reduce]{.underline}** the
**[effectiveness]{.underline}** of security cooperation as a strategy
which could potentially strengthen relationships between the United
States and host nations, and reduce the possibility that the U.S. may be
drawn into armed conflict.

It is, therefore, important to identify how the issues associated with
the inconsistent and inappropriate applications of the term, security
cooperation in the conflict in Afghanistan has raised concerns with
potential adversaries such as China.

In summary, the problem that motivated this thesis is the recognition
that [there is]{.underline} **[confusion]{.underline}** [in
the]{.underline} **[definition]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[recent application of security cooperation]{.underline}** in Iraq and
Afghanistan, and concerns that [the]{.underline}
**[confusion]{.underline}** [will lead this valuable strategy to be
**dismissed before it is properly articulated**]{.underline}. This
problem will be addressed by describing a research based and
**[effective]{.underline}** [application of security
operations]{.underline} that [supports host nation]{.underline}
**[autonomy]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[minimizes]{.underline}**
[the possibility of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [being]{.underline} **[drawn into armed
conflict]{.underline}**.

Background and Need for the Study

The **[precise use of words]{.underline}** by Department of Defense
officials [is]{.underline} **[critical]{.underline}** to formulating and
executing military strategy.11 [When developing a]{.underline}
**[plan]{.underline}** of action, **[loosely defined]{.underline}**
[military terms can affect planners' abilities to properly
understand]{.underline} the **[actual capabilities]{.underline}**
[resident in a proposed course of action]{.underline}.12 In Afghanistan,
the misapplication of the military term security cooperation fostered a
climate that caused the Department of Defense and State to underestimate
the significant role of SC in fostering the diplomatic relationships
that contribute to international peace and stability.

As a major in the Marine Corps, I planned and participated in a security
cooperation exercise with Estonia. It was important to the United States
European combatant commander and the commanding general Estonian Self
Defense Force that communication with the media specifically addressed
our operation as a security cooperation exercise. Eighteen countries
participated in the exercise, to include the United States and Estonia,
and sixteen other countries that are part of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). However, this exercise, named BALTIC OPERATIONS,
was not officially a NATO exercise.

This distinction between security cooperation exercise and NATO exercise
may seem like nothing more than semantics. However a misunderstanding of
the semantic nuances had potential negative strategic consequences.
Estonia shares a border with Russia and former Soviet military forces
occupied Estonia prior to the 1991 Singing Revolution. Diplomatic
tensions between Estonia and Russia remain tense and Estonia is
constantly defending its territorial waters in the Baltic Sea against
Russian naval vessels. During the exercise a Russian frigate and a
Russian submarine attempted to violate Estonia's territorial water. In
response, Estonia deployed a small portion of its Navy to block the
Russian vessels and force a return to internationally recognized neutral
waters shared by countries bordering the Baltic Sea. This level of
international tension between Estonia and Russia is constant. If the
participants of a security cooperation exercise were to describe the
event as a NATO exercise, it would be interpreted by Russia as a signal
that NATO forces, led by the United States, were rehearsing air, land,
and sea strategies in the Baltic Sea that would support an amphibious
assault against the Russian city of St. Petersburg. This instance and
many others like it demonstrate that the improper use of military
terminology can have unintended negative consequences.

According to the authors of a paper written for USAID, the
**[reconstruction]{.underline}** strategy in Afghanistan, [is
often]{.underline} **[mislabeled]{.underline}** [as]{.underline}
**[security cooperation]{.underline}**, and designed to support the
withdraw of United States military forces from Afghanistan.13 This
example demonstrates the tendency to confuse Afghan reconstruction with
SC. [SC is a]{.underline} **[prehostilities]{.underline}** [strategy to
effectively and peacefully resolve emerging problems]{.underline}
**[prior]{.underline}** [to the eruption of violence and the need to
commit U.S.]{.underline} **[forces]{.underline}** to a contingency
operation.14 [This is]{.underline} **[contrasted]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} [**reconstruction**, a term that describes
aid]{.underline} provided **[during]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[**after military conflict**. This]{.underline}
**[contrast]{.underline}** [highlights the need to protect]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} **[integrity of]{.underline}** the
**[SC]{.underline}** [and the importance of **identifying operations
where SC is confused**]{.underline}. Indeed one of the basic assumptions
under which I will proceed with this thesis is that [SC, properly
defined, occupies a critical role in the overall strategy
to]{.underline} **[prevent]{.underline}** the United States from
[entering into armed conflict]{.underline} **[rather]{.underline}**
[than a strategy **employed**]{.underline} [after hostilities have
commenced]{.underline}.

**[Military doctrine, national strategy, and specialized dictionaries
for military professionals and government policy makers, present a
precise definition of and specific criteria for the strategic
application of security cooperation]{.underline}**.15 Yet a review of
case studies by organizations like the United States Agency for
International Development and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and
International Affairs that focus on Provincial Reconstruction Teams in
Afghanistan, demonstrates that the current application of security
cooperation is inconsistent with its doctrinal definition.16 Moreover,
my professional military experience with the doctrinal application of
security cooperation and Provincial Reconstruction Teams provides a
first hand account that reinforces the observation that doctrinal
definition and contemporary practical application of Security
cooperation are inconsistent.

The literature review will establish the premise that security
cooperation as an academic area of study receives little attention.17
The paucity of literature on the subject contributes to the current
misunderstanding of the definition as well as its improper strategic
utilization. Authors who participate in scholarly conversation on the
topic fall into one of two categories, doctrinal use or modern
misconception.18 The contradictory nature of the literature further
supports my hypothesis that the definition of security cooperation is
frequently not applied in Afghanistan.

The history of security cooperation provides an unambiguous storyboard
that details the inception and proper application of the foreign
relations strategy. Current events in Afghanistan and elsewhere appear
to reflect a distorted image of historical precedent for security
cooperation. However, the evidence will show this distortion not only to
be the fault of a poor understanding and application of security
cooperation by planners, but also to be the fault of United States
foreign policy that compounds the problem of achieving clarity because
it confounds the doctrinal definition and implementation of security
cooperation. 19

Indeed, actions taken by the Department of Defense in an effort to
shorten the duration of the war in Afghanistan, coupled with foreign
policy statements made by the Secretary of State, demonstrate the extent
to which misunderstanding and a misapplication of the term has permeated
the vested departments of the government. I will attempt to illustrate
how far the Department of Defense and State Department planners and
policy makers have wandered from the precepts developed at the
strategy's inception by providing examples of case studies that depict
an unvarnished execution of security cooperation strategy when it is
properly centered on its seminal concepts.20 Additionally, I will
reinforce the critical concept that security cooperation was devised as
a powerful tool meant to promote international peace and to prevent the
necessity of the United States entering into armed conflict.

Purpose of the Study

[Words]{.underline} **[have meaning]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline}
**[unique ideas]{.underline}** that are [transmitted through the use
of]{.underline} **[military vocabulary]{.underline}** [demand that
the]{.underline} **[author and]{.underline}** the
**[orator]{.underline}** [communicate with]{.underline}
**[specificity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**clarity**. In the
case of]{.underline} **[security cooperation]{.underline}**, my research
indicates that **[military professionals, government officials, and
academics]{.underline}** [appear]{.underline} to be equally [guilty
of]{.underline} **[failing to limit their use of the term to its correct
context]{.underline}**. Most [**egregiously**, the term is
being]{.underline} **[improperly used]{.underline}** [as an important
element that describes]{.underline} the United States
**[exit]{.underline}** strategy [from]{.underline}
**[Afghanistan]{.underline}**.21 An example of the recent comments made
by the Secretary of State as she described the current state of affairs
in Washington, D.C. and Afghanistan, that the State Department convened
an interagency team, including DOD, USAID, and the NSC and held
discussions that resulted in an agreement that included strong
commitments on economic/social development, democratic
institution-building, human rights, anticorruption, and other important
long-term reforms. Mrs. Secretary follows up on this statement by
saying; "Ambassador Crocker and General Allen are still working through
some of the security cooperation issues with President Karzai".22 To
place these comments into context, the Honorable Mrs. Clinton was
incorrectly describing the peace process in Afghanistan and the withdraw
of U.S. forces as security cooperation.

**[Doctrinally]{.underline}**, [security cooperation is]{.underline}
**[unrelated to a military withdraw]{.underline}** from a country [at
the]{.underline} **[conclusion]{.underline}** [of armed
conflict]{.underline}.23 I was caught by surprise; therefore, to
discover that despite the efforts of the Department of Defense to
accurately articulate its professional lexicon via a dictionary of
military terms and doctrine, basic concepts and their associated
framework of action were being misused. 24 Initially I thought that I
was encountering isolated instances of misuse, but further reading led
me to believe that the misapplication of this particular term was wide
spread. 25

Policy that expresses the cooperative philosophy of defensive liberalism
and a strategy of security cooperation are complementary.
[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[could use security]{.underline} **[coop]{.underline}**eration [as a
means to export its]{.underline} democratic [ideals]{.underline}
**[peacefully]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[distance
itself]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} the **[improper]{.underline}**
[use of security cooperation as a tool for]{.underline}
**[reconstruction]{.underline}** in Afghanistan. To begin with,
**[realistic]{.underline}** [expectations of **SC**]{.underline}
capabilities [must be formed]{.underline} during key leader engagements.
During key leader engagements both the Department of Defense and State
Department could participate in conversations with political leadership
from the host nation on policy and strategy. During these executive
level meetings the expectations of what SC can achieve are discussed,
policy expectations are presented as goals, and resources from both
countries are allocated to achieve agreed upon goals. During these
engagements leadership from both countries are developing a shared
vision on the future of the host nation. Importantly the U.S. has been
invited to participate in the realization of the host nation's vision.
Key leader engagements ultimately manage the expectations of both
countries and define agreed upon realistic and achievable goals. The
U.S. policy and strategy toward Afghanistan does not achieve this and
results in the current unrealistic expectation that security cooperation
will achieve the goal of reconstructing Afghanistan.

[Two]{.underline} **[basic tenets of]{.underline}** a
**[SC]{.underline}** strategy [are]{.underline} **[voluntary
participation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**Phase 0
implementation**. A country that]{.underline} **[voluntarily
participates]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} a **[SC]{.underline}**
strategy [with the U.S. is]{.underline} **[deliberately
choosing]{.underline}** [to invest]{.underline} its [resources in
achieving common goals that benefit both the U.S. and the host nation.
Implementing a SC strategy]{.underline} **[prior to the onset of
conflict]{.underline}** [allows both the U.S. and the participating
country to focus on agreed upon goals]{.underline}
**[instead]{.underline}** [of conflict]{.underline}. Vested interest on
behalf of a host nation is critical to the success of SC, when a country
acts as equal partner with the U.S. and is not distracted by the fall
out of conflict it is reasonable to expect common desires shared between
two countries will be achieved. Estonia and Philippines are two examples
of successful voluntary participation in U.S. SC strategies that were
implemented during phase 0. The current Afghanistan reconstruction plan
and the establishment of the Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq that
are paraded around as SC does not meet either one of these basic tenets.

The strategy of SC was foisted onto Afghanistan. The people of
Afghanistan did not ask to be invaded by the U.S. and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO). The reconstruction obligation placed on the
U.S., as a result of its invasion, forces Afghanistan to participate in
a process it does not embrace. The U.S. has placed Afghanistan in a
dilemma. Afghanistan can reject current U.S. policy and use its
sovereignty to eject the U.S. and all countries participating in the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission. This course of
action may be emotionally satisfying to the Islamic Republic however
logically it would cause a power vacuum to form and the country would
revert to a state of civil and tribal war. Alternatively Afghanistan can
prevent a power vacuum by allowing the U.S. and ISAF to remain in
Afghanistan. By continuing to support the current U.S. policy
Afghanistan tacitly allows the U.S. to apply the wrong strategic
resources in an effort to achieve the policy goals identified by
Secretary Clinton. Based on the current situation it appears that
Afghanistan will allow the U.S. and ISAF to remain in Afghanistan and
execute its faulty SC strategy.

Given the choice between allowing Afghanistan to fall into chaos or
allow the U.S. to stubbornly continue on a wrong strategic course of
action the political leadership in Afghanistan truly has no choice at
all. The government of Afghanistan has little if any input into the
policy and strategy described by the Secretary of State. The U.S. has
shackled Afghanistan to its strategy and denied the political leadership
any opportunity to freely participate in the misidentified SC strategy
to reconstruct Afghanistan. At its very core the current policy and
strategy that identifies SC as the way to successfully reconstruct
Afghanistan is antithetical to the accurate definition of SC.

Accepting the fact that both Iraq and Afghanistan were wars engaged in
as a result of offensive liberalism and using the tools of
reconstruction to put an end to the current conflicts will best preserve
the potential good that can emerge from a properly employed strategy of
security cooperation. Ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan provide
the National Security Council an opportunity to redraft the National
Security Strategy and employ security cooperation as it was intended.
[Policy rooted in the]{.underline} **[philosophy]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[defensive liberalism]{.underline}** [could be used
to]{.underline} **[peacefully export]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[ideals of democracy]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} [**security
cooperation activities**. As a strategy that is properly aligned with
policy goals, security cooperation is an effective method of
promulgating **friendly**]{.underline} [international relationships that
are **mutually** beneficial]{.underline} to the host nation and the
United States, [and]{.underline} has the potential to
**[prevent]{.underline}** [war]{.underline}.

[The number and complexity of peacetime **security cooperative
activities**]{.underline} [undertaken by the U.S. armed forces with
other countries]{.underline} and mihtaries [increased steadily during
the]{.underline} 19**[90s]{.underline}**. During the 1990s,
[these]{.underline} activities **[were]{.underline}** [collectively
termed]{.underline} **[\"engagement.\"]{.underline}** [Beginning with
the]{.underline} **[2001]{.underline}** Quadrennial Defense Review
(**[QDR]{.underline}**), [they have been referred to as]{.underline}
**[\"security cooperation.\"]{.underline}** Although security
cooperation activities further both service and national goals, the Army
plays a prominent role as the executive agent for many, if not most, of
them. The Army programs and activities that fall under the rubric of
security cooperation are referred to as Army International Activities
(AIA).

However, **[Headquarters Department of the Army]{.underline}** (HQDA)
[does]{.underline} **[not possess a comprehensive understanding and
appreciation]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} **[extent
of]{.underline}** the Army\'s **[activities in security
cooperation]{.underline}**. This is partly [attributable to shortcomings
in]{.underline} **[security cooperation management]{.underline}**
processes [and]{.underline} **[policies]{.underline}** at the national
and Department of Defense (DoD) levels, but it equally stems from
weaknesses in the Army\'s own approach to AIA. Indeed, [there
is]{.underline} **[no effective linkage]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline} the execution of **[security cooperation
missions]{.underline}** and the provision of accurate planning
information as HQDA develops its Program Objective Memorandum (POM).
This leaves HQDA with limited means to understand fully the PERSTEMPO
and resources implications ofAIA, let alone effective measures to
influence resource planning and management for these activities. This
study sought to help the U.S. Army improve its ability to assess future
demand for Army resources devoted to security cooperation and to
evaluate the impact ofthese demands upon the resources available to the
Army.

Data collection and almost all of the research on the project were
conducted prior to the attacks on the United States on September 11,
2001. A draft report was submitted to the sponsor in mid-2002. It was
revised and updated selectively to include the major developments in
security cooperation policy up through the beginning of 2004.

The first step in the research was a review of the [guidelines for
security cooperation planning in the]{.underline}
19**[90s]{.underline}**, which [revealed a]{.underline} **[lack of
definitional clarity]{.underline}** [within]{.underline}
**[DoD]{.underline}** [as to]{.underline} **[what constituted
\"engagement.\"]{.underline}** [The]{.underline} definitional
**[ambiguity]{.underline}** **[impeded]{.underline}** [a better
institutional understanding of, and management over, ALA. activities.
From the perspective of bringing greater **specificity**]{.underline}
[to the Army\'s]{.underline} **[peacetime activities]{.underline}**
[with other countries and armed forces, the replacement of the
**vague**]{.underline} [term]{.underline}
**[\"engagement\"]{.underline}** [with a more]{.underline}
**[focused]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[better defined \"security
cooperation\"]{.underline}** [has been a step in the **right
direction**]{.underline}. As of the completion of this monograph, there
remains in place a mixture of the former \"engagement\" planning
mechanisms and a new set of goals, tied more specifically to military
missions and focusing more on established allies and partners.

The unified combatant commanders (UCCs) are the primary demanders for
AIA, and given that they are not responsible for providing resources for
AIA, their demand is theoretically infinite. The existing UCC-level
security cooperation planning systems often lack concrete measures of
effectiveness and do not incorporate fully both cost and benefit
information with respect to security cooperation. The institutional
providers ofsecurity cooperation (such as the Department of the Army, as
provider ofAIA activities) do not have clear visibility into the
payoffstemming from security cooperation activities. Even though the
UCCs, component commands. Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and
embassy teams all have excellent systems of informal communication to
oversee the execution and management ofsecurity cooperation (and
specifically security assistance), they are not formalized and the
planning process is subject to ad hoc decisionmaking.

A review of the resourcing processes and trends in recent (since fiscal
year 1995) Army expenditures on AIA shows that the Army\'s budgeting
system is not well structured to account for basic AIA expenditures. We
were able to arrive at an aggregate level of the direct Army costs
associated with AIA for the period 1995-2001 (and make estimates until
2005). Since 1995, the direct costs have fluctuated largely in the
\$400-\$5 00 million range annually. The AIA resource management problem
is compounded by the lack of both a definitive list of activities and a
mechanism that links unofficial AIA categories with official Army and
DoD resourcing categories. In addition, the Army is not properly
accounting for many personnel costs related to security cooperation and,
in some cases, is missing an opportunity to increase the amount of
administrative costs charged directly to the customer. As a result of
the disjointed nature of AIA programming and budgeting, HQDA is
currently incapable of capturing the many hidden costs associated with
AIA. The situation precludes HQDA from making fully informed policy and
resource decisions with regard to security cooperation programs.

In an overall sense, the existing security cooperation planning process
is exceedingly complex, involving a multitude of actors, problematic
incentive systems, incomplete information exchange, and no reliable
measures of effectiveness. Virtually all of the stakeholders understand
only certain aspects ofthe process and/or have only partial visibility
into the process. The drivers and demanders ofAIA tend to have an
incomplete understanding of the resourcing problems and the tradeoffs
involved in making AIA choices. In turn, HQDA (the supplier ofAIA
resources) has an incomplete understanding of the benefits ofAIA, and
the Army\'s own resourcing tools are not easily amenable to an in-depth
understanding of the resources it commits to AIA. Fundamentally, demand
for AIA is predicated upon the amount of AIA supply provided by the
Department of the Army, as opposed to the latter being the product of
policy, strategy, and resource guidance. Indeed, incrementalism and
continuity, rather than policy and strategy, have been the principal
driving agents in the development ofAIA resource priorities.

The 2003 Army International Activities Plan (AIAP) has established the
policy framework for a strategy-driven AIA management process, but deep
institutional issues within DoD and the Army must be addressed before
the AIA management process matches the vision ofthe AIAP.

In the post-September 11 security environment, the planning system of
AIA needs greater flexibility and efficiency as a crucial component of
the global war on terrorism. The need for flexibility and adaptability
in security cooperation---to accommodate shifting priorities (new
partners, different mix of activities) and to seize opportunities that
may be short-lived---has made essential the reform of the security
cooperation planning and implementation process.

Recommendations

The premise for our recommendations is that even though some of the
deeply embedded problems in the security cooperation planning process
will remain, steps can be taken to lessen the divergences and
inefficiencies stemming from the different incentive systems ofthe main
actors.

As the security cooperation planning process is reformed, an important
goal will be to eliminate the definitional ambiguities that have plagued
security cooperation planning during the 1990s. HQDA has a strong
interest in ensuring that the official definition of \"security
cooperation\" accurately reflects the U.S. Army\'s extensive activities
in this area.

Given the Army\'s extensive benefits from, and involvement in, security
cooperation, HQDA needs to encourage, and take a leading role in, the
reform of the theater security cooperation planning system. It follows
then that the Army Staff should be intimately involved in the
development ofthe new planning methodology in order to ensure that its
program and management activities are properly and sufficiently covered
in defense resource planning.

The decision to disestablish DUSA-IA may open a policy and budget void
in HQDA that will need to be filled by DAMO-SS. DAMO-SS is the logical
division within G-3 (ODCSOPS) to provide HQDA policy guidance for, and
establish priorities in, the development of Army capabilities to support
national theater security cooperation strategy. Importantly, an
administrative and resource vehicle is needed to link AIA strategy
clearly to resources. The revision of the AIAP is ideally suited to this
requirement. The revised document should provide clear guidance and
priorities to MACOMs that would enable those commanders to develop
theater security cooperation supporting activities and relevant POM
program elements that are in conformance with HQDA policy. Improved
policy and resource planning systems will also have the important
benefit of preparing Army component commanders to manage more
effectively UCCs\' demand for AIA.

[The]{.underline} Army\'s approach to **[security
assistance]{.underline}** ([a]{.underline} **[category]{.underline}**
[of security cooperation that includes]{.underline} primarily [the
provision of]{.underline} **[equipment]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[training]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[other
militaries]{.underline}**) needs to be reformed, if not thoroughly
reengineered. HQDA needs to initiate this effort. The current system, as
a general observation, is not optimally set up to meet customer
requirements; nor does the Army, institutionally, see security
assistance as an opportunity to capitalize on potential financial
advantages. A potential starting point is through a basic review of how
the Army delivers security assistance and the development
ofArmy-specific metrics to enable HQDA to better manage and monitor the
benefits (and accurate reimbursement) ofindividual programs.

### Must Be DoD

#### Security assistance is the [generic term]{.underline} for working with a foreign country on security issues. It is agent-agnostic. Security [cooperation]{.underline} is a [subset]{.underline} of security assistance that uses [only DoD]{.underline}.

Over the past decade, [Congress has]{.underline} substantially
[increased]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[S]{.underline}**tate [and]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense (DOD) [efforts to train, equip, and otherwise
engage with foreign military and other security forces. As these efforts
have increased, congressional]{.underline} **[questions]{.underline}**
and concerns [have]{.underline} **[multiplied]{.underline}**. Such
concerns range from broad to specific---for example, the perceived lack
of an overarching strategy for such assistance or, [more]{.underline}
**[specifically]{.underline}**, [the utility of the current]{.underline}
[**legal framework**, appropriate]{.underline} **[State Department and
DOD roles]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**modes of coordination**,
and]{.underline} program **[effectiveness]{.underline}**.

[The]{.underline} **[legal and institutional framework]{.underline}**
[through which the State and Defense departments **share
responsibility**]{.underline} [for providing]{.underline} such
[assistance has **evolved**]{.underline} over time,
[creating]{.underline} what some have labeled [a]{.underline} complex
and confusing **["patchwork"]{.underline}** [of authorities]{.underline}
and arrangements. For most of the past half-century, Congress has
authorized such assistance programs under Title 22 of the U.S. Code
(Foreign Relations), specifically the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as
amended (1961 FAA, P.L. 87-195), and the Arms Export Control Act, as
amended (AECA, P.L. 90-629), and appropriated the bulk of funds to State
Department accounts. A DOD agency has administered those funds under the
Secretary of State's direction and oversight.

After the attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001 (9/11),
policymakers have increasingly come to view the United States as facing
new military threats and challenges to which the State Department
authorities could not appropriately respond. As a result, Congress has
increasingly provided DOD with the means to provide such assistance
under its own Title 10 U.S. Code (Armed Services) and the annual
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authority and funding under
the DOD budget. As U.S. assistance to foreign forces has risen, and
increasingly been provided under DOD budgets, some policymakers have
questioned the utility of such aid, as well as the efficacy of the legal
and institutional framework under which it is provided.

Current State and DOD security assistance and engagement efforts involve
a range of activities, including "traditional" programs transferring
conventional arms for defense posture purposes, training and equipping
regular and irregular forces for combat, conducting counterterrorism
programs, and expanding education and training programs. Obama
Administration officials have argued that such efforts are
cost-effective in the long run, potentially generating considerable
savings in U.S. defense costs. Some policymakers, however, look at the
mixed record of success and question whether the expenditure of billions
of dollars on such programs is justified. Some wonder whether reforming
such programs may improve results.

This report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to and engagement
with foreign military and other security forces. It focuses on various
aspects of the respective State Department and DOD roles, particularly
their broad "shared responsibility" for security assistance.2

It includes

>  information on the historical evolution and current status of State
> Department and DOD responsibilities,
>
>  an overview of current State Department, DOD, and joint State-DOD
> authorities, and
>
>  a discussion of key oversight questions.

In the issues section, the report identifies certain questions Congress
may wish to raise: How should security assistance/cooperation
effectiveness be assessed? Should the current statutory and
institutional framework be modified or changed? Are agencies provided
sufficient resources to carry out their institutional roles? How might
congressional oversight and public transparency be improved?

Key Concepts and Terminology

Two concepts merit emphasizing as they are key to understanding the
legal and institutional framework governing U.S. assistance (i.e.,
weapons, supplies, training, and other support) to and engagement with
foreign military and other security forces:

>  U.S. assistance to and engagement with foreign forces is often a
> shared responsibility among two or more U.S. government agencies,
> principally between the State Department and DOD, but also with
> others.
>
>  U.S. assistance to and engagement with foreign forces serves
> multiple purposes.

Several terms are often related to such assistance and engagement, but
no standard governmentwide terminology exists. This section briefly
discusses those concepts and terms. For a fuller listing of terms and
definitions, see Appendix A.

Shared Responsibility

Foreign military and other security assistance is a shared
responsibility across the U.S. government. Although the State Department
and DOD are the major players, other U.S. agencies also contribute to
U.S. security assistance efforts, including the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID), the Departments of Energy (DOE),
Homeland Security (DHS), Justice, and Treasury, along with members of
the intelligence community.

Conducting foreign relations is the State Department's responsibility,
and the Secretary of State, as the President's primary foreign policy
advisor, contributes to the development of the President's foreign
policy and ensures its coherent implementation. Defending the country
against foreign threats is the DOD's core mission. The State
Department-DOD shared responsibility is a result of the overlap in these
functions when assisting foreign militaries and other security forces
for the mutual benefit of a foreign government and the United States.

The United States has long recognized that it may at times be required
to act alone to deter or combat threats. Nevertheless, since the end of
World War II, policymakers have asserted that U.S. long-term security
also requires cultivating foreign governments as allies to counter
potential mutual enemies (or the enemies that threaten U.S. allies). The
State Department-DOD shared responsibility arises from the many
decisions that must be made in providing allies' and partners'
militaries and other security forces with the equipment and training
necessary to combat those enemies. Determining what equipment and
training a foreign government needs and can effectively utilize requires
military expertise. Determining how the provision of that equipment will
affect relations with a foreign government and its people (as well as
the governments of neighboring countries) and regional/international
balances of power requires diplomatic skills and international affairs
expertise. Determining whether a country's economy can absorb the cost
of maintaining adequate military forces, and acquiring and maintaining
military equipment, is a judgment for economists and development
specialists.

In recent years, some policymakers and analysts have expressed concern
over what they identify as a growing imbalance between the departments
with the growing DOD role, leading to the "militarization" of U.S.
foreign policy.3 Some contend that this trend stems from the substantial
advantages of DOD personnel resources and Congress's provision of a
growing number of new authorities to conduct security assistance
missions. On the other hand, others perceive that weaknesses in the
State Department's planning and implementation culture, limited
personnel, and insufficient resources have compelled DOD to seek its own
authorities and greater resources.

Multiple Purposes4

Foreign military and other security assistance serves multiple purposes,
both for the U.S. government5 and for recipient governments. As
expressed in many documents since the immediate post-World War II
period, foreign military assistance has been viewed as a means to foster
international stability. U.S. security can be enhanced by spreading the
burden for mutual defense, and by helping other governments deter or
combat external aggression or internal subversion by countries or forces
that may pose long-term risks to the United States.

For the U.S. government, foreign military aid may also be a diplomatic
asset. Such assistance may be used to cultivate goodwill and, in some
cases, to persuade foreign governments to take positions or measures
that the United States believes beneficial to its own and allied
interests, or to express support for such actions. In addition, DOD uses
foreign military and other security assistance as a tool to develop
institutional ties with foreign militaries, cultivating relations that
may be useful in dealing with future crises and fighting together in
future conflicts. "Building partner capacity" through security
assistance has been highlighted in recent defense strategy and guidance
as a key component of defense planning and a significant means of
decreasing DOD budgets in the long run. 6

On the receiving end, the governments, military and security forces, and
populations of recipient countries may incur both benefits and costs
from such assistance. Foreign governments and militaries may use such
aid to help them deter or actively counter aggression from other states.
At times, foreign governments may use such aid to help battle or
suppress domestic foes. In some cases, however, this aid may, from a
U.S. perspective, upset the political balance within a country, enabling
powerful militaries to unduly influence, pressure, or oust fledgling
democratic governments or to suppress democratic opposition or movements
in ways that may include, on some occasions, the violation of human
rights. Moreover, maintaining or sustaining military and security forces
may harm a country's economic prospects by diverting scarce funds from
economic development to military purposes. Although U.S. military
assistance is potentially beneficial, unless it is carefully calibrated
and monitored, such assistance may have unintended consequences
affecting U.S. interests in and relations with a recipient country, as
well as the surrounding region.

Definitional Problems

The discussion of U.S. assistance to foreign military and other security
forces is complicated by the lack of a standard and adequate
terminology. "Military assistance," "security assistance," "security
cooperation," "security sector assistance," "security force assistance,"
and "defense articles and services" are all terms used in connection
with the supply of weapons, equipment, supplies, and training to such
forces and, in some cases, engagement with them. Some of these terms are
defined by policy documents or in law (see Appendix A). Some authorities
are labeled with two more informal terms---"build partner capacity" or
"train and equip"---which are used in the discussion of specific
authorities below.7

Terminology

[The]{.underline} two [terms]{.underline} **[most commonly used
today]{.underline}** [for assistance to foreign military and security
forces are]{.underline} **["security assistance"]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **["security cooperation."]{.underline}**
[Security]{.underline} **[assistance]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} the
term most frequently used, **[regardless of the agency]{.underline}**
[providing that assistance]{.underline}.

There is no State Department definition for security assistance. The
annual State Department congressional budget justification (CBJ),
however, lists six budget accounts under the heading "International
Security Assistance." These accounts, with their underlying Title 22
authorities (the 1961 FAA and the AECA), are commonly regarded as the
State Department's security assistance portfolio.

DOD formally defines security assistance as the group of State
Department 1961 FAA and AECA programs that a DOD organization, the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), administers. These include
programs conducted under two of the State Department international
security assistance accounts and attendant authorities, as well as
programs conducted under four related 1961 FAA and AECA authorities.

DOD uses the overarching term "security cooperation" to denote the State
Department security assistance administered by DSCA through which the
U.S. government furnishes defense articles, military training, and other
defense-related services, as well as all other DOD interactions with
foreign defense establishments. The purposes of the interactions with
foreign defense establishments defined as security cooperation are to
"build defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security
interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multilateral operations, and provide US forces with
peacetime and contingency access to a host nation."8

Likewise, Joint Publication 3-0 states, "**[Military
engagement]{.underline}** [occurs as **part**]{.underline} [of security
cooperation]{.underline}, but also extends to interaction with domestic
civilian authorities."11 For simplicity, throughout this discussion,
[the term]{.underline} **[security cooperation]{.underline}** will
**[include]{.underline}** [interactions with **both military and
domestic civilian authorities**]{.underline}.

**[multiple]{.underline}** number of **[activities]{.underline}** that
[can occur under]{.underline} the umbrella of **[security

four broad categories: stability operations, preparing for coalition
operations, information and intelligence sharing, and strategic
access.13 Grouping all the security cooperation activities into these
four broad categories is non-doctrinal, but forms a good framework for
consideration.

Background: Theater Security Cooperation

[Security cooperation has been a part of the U.S. Armed Forces for many
years]{.underline}. In fact, **[historians]{.underline}** [reveal that
the U.S. military has]{.underline} **[always]{.underline}** [engaged in
security cooperation with other countries and their military forces.
However,]{.underline} **[the term]{.underline}** [used to designate such
activities is]{.underline} **[now "Security Cooperation,"]{.underline}**
[a term that has **evolved conceptually**]{.underline} through various
programs [over the years. During the]{.underline} [**1990s**, the
terms]{.underline} **["engagement"]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**["shaping"]{.underline}** [were used]{.underline}
**[without]{.underline}** sufficient **[specificity]{.underline}**; they
were [often]{.underline} used [**interchangeably**, resulting
in]{.underline} **[confusion]{.underline}** that led to problems in both
planning and execution. [DOD thus **adopted "Security Cooperation" in
2001**. It included a **broad range of military-to-military
activities**]{.underline}, but it also clarified roles and
responsibilities.

[The term]{.underline} **[Security Cooperation]{.underline}** thus
[describes a]{.underline} **[broad range of activities]{.underline}**
[used by the]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense [in peacetime operations.
These activities refer to]{.underline} **[all DOD
interactions]{.underline}** that are [**carried out with foreign defense
establishments**, such as combined]{.underline}
**[exercises]{.underline}**, combined **[training]{.underline}**,
combined **[education]{.underline}**, military-to-military
**[contacts]{.underline}**, **[humanitarian assistance]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[info]{.underline}**rmation
**[op]{.underline}**eration**[s]{.underline}**.

### Title 10 & Title 22

#### The core definition of security cooperation is anything done with another country during times of peace to enhance security. Some of its activities are authorized under Title 10, others under Title 22. Broad interpretations are best for reasons of conceptual clarity.

Refining the Scope of Security Cooperation

[The US Armed Forces have peacefully interacted with other militaries
through much of their history, but the **mechanisms**]{.underline} [of
security cooperation have **changed**]{.underline}. A brief examination
is in order, as [the relevancy of]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations [theory will
not become apparent without **first**]{.underline} [understanding **what
security cooperation activities are**]{.underline}.

[A Cold War era commentator established that "**the purpose of U.S.
military and security aid is to apply American power
internationally**]{.underline} [by:]{.underline} first, [strengthening
the]{.underline} **[defensive capabilities of states in the American
alliance structure]{.underline}**; second, [helping]{.underline}
**[friendly nations]{.underline}** [quell]{.underline} **[internal
political or military disturbances]{.underline}**; [and]{.underline}
third, [assisting friendly nations in **buying breathing
space**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, with luck, in [regaining or
retaining stability]{.underline}."2 America‟s post-Cold War identity,
once described by former Secretary of State Madeline Albright as the
"indispensible nation," 3 has done little to alter these objectives.
[American military assistance **continues**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[strengthen]{.underline}** our **[global
security]{.underline}** posture [by protecting American interests,
supporting our partners, and postponing security challenges whenever
possible]{.underline}.

Currently, the US Armed Forces are charged with shaping the geostrategic
environment in coordination with foreign partners in four of the five
missions described in the Strategic Guidance document of January 2012.4
[When]{.underline} **[not in]{.underline}** actual [**combat**, the
military does this]{.underline} **[every day]{.underline}** [when it
conducts activities abroad. Security assistance programs are controlled
under **Title 22**]{.underline} (Foreign Assistance) [of the US Code,
while]{.underline} **[other]{.underline}** [military cooperation tasks
fall under]{.underline} **[Title 10]{.underline}** (Defense) [and
are]{.underline} directly [tasked to the]{.underline} [**Defense
Department**. Security cooperation, however, is identified in the
**Joint lexicon**]{.underline} [as "all]{.underline}
**[DOD]{.underline}** [interactions with foreign defense establishments
to build defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security
interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces with
peacetime and contingency access to a host nation]{.underline}."5 [This
essay accepts this]{.underline} **[inclusive]{.underline}** [list, and
defines security cooperation as]{.underline} [**all military to military
relationships, activities, and exchanges conducted outside of a zone of
conflict or during times of peace**. It will **include all State
Department funded Title 22 activities as well as all interactions with
foreign armed forces financed by the Defense Department, the individual
Armed Services, or the worldwide Geographic Combatant Commands**. Since
all these activities]{.underline} **[affect]{.underline}** [military to
military relationships, and consequently shape the geostrategic
environment, they should be addressed]{.underline}
**[together]{.underline}** [to better]{.underline} **[synergize their
effects]{.underline}**.

**[Security Cooperation]{.underline}** (SC) Overview

[The]{.underline} Department of Defense (**[DOD]{.underline}**) [uses
the term]{.underline} security cooperation (SC) [to refer **broadly** to
**DOD interactions with foreign security establishments**]{.underline}.
SC [activities include]{.underline}

> [ the transfer of defense articles and services;]{.underline}
>
> [ military-to-military exercises;]{.underline}
>
> [ military education, training, and advising; and]{.underline}
>
> [ capacity building of partner security forces.]{.underline}

SC programs are intended to encourage and enable partner nations (PNs)
to work with the United States to achieve strategic objectives. They are
considered a key tool for achieving U.S. national security and foreign
policy objectives. These activities are executed through both
DOD-administered SC programs (authorized under Title 10, U.S.C.) and
DOD-implemented State Department (DOS) security assistance (SA) programs
(authorized under Title 22, U.S.C). Beyond grant-based programs, SC
encompasses the Foreign Military Sales program and enables U.S. and PN
collaboration on defense articles. The following sections focus on DOD
"Title 10" activities.

SC: Policy and Objectives

SC activities aim to achieve particular objectives in support of U.S.
national security and defense strategies. Specifically, SC may build
defense relationships that promote U.S. security interests, enhance
military capabilities of U.S. allies and partners, and provide the
United States with access to PNs. Under the overarching goal of
furthering U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, SC
emphasizes partnerships, aiming to be mutually beneficial for the United
States and its partners. SC activities aim to develop and strengthen a
PN's ability to provide internal security, contribute to regional
security efforts, combat shared threats, and increase military
interoperability with the United States.

The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) signaled the Trump
Administration's intention to shift SC activities from nearly two
decades of prioritizing counterterrorism toward "great power
competition" (GPC) with Russia and China. The shift raised questions as
to how SC should be realigned to meet this objective and what the
implications could be for scaling down counterterrorism-focused SC
activities in Africa and the Middle East, especially as Russia and China
increase their influence. Some DOD officials and defense analysts have
suggested that rather than a shift, counterterrorism, as well as
irregular warfare, should remain priorities within GPC. The Biden
Administration has yet to release a new NDS; however, its Interim
National Security Strategic Guidance broadly identifies authoritarianism
and strategic competition as priority threats that require coordination
and cooperation with allies and partners.

SC: Roles and Responsibilities

[Many SC activities require DOD to]{.underline}
**[coordinate]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} **[multiple DOD
components]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**other federal
departments**, primarily]{.underline} [**DOS**. Some]{.underline} **[DOD
SC activities]{.underline}** [require]{.underline} varying levels of
**[coordination]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} **[DOS]{.underline}**.
Within DOD, the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy (USD\[P\])
exercises overall direction, authority, and control over SC matters.

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (**[DSCA]{.underline}**)
[represents the interests of the Secretary of Defense and USD(P) in SC
matters]{.underline} and is tasked with directing, administering, and
executing many SC programs, developing SC policy, and providing DOD-wide
SC guidance. [DSCA is also DOD's main interlocutor between the PNs,
implementing agencies, and the defense industry. The Assistant Secretary
of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict
(ASD-SO/LIC) oversees and approves some SC training activities that are
managed by DSCA. U.S. Special Operations Command]{.underline} (SOCOM)
[coordinates those SC activities executed by special operations forces
(SOF). DOS leads U.S. foreign aid and has final say on SA. DOS's Bureau
of Political-Military Affairs (PM) is the principal link to DOD and
ensures that SA is integrated with other U.S. policies and activities at
the country, regional, and global levels.]{.underline} PM also
determines PN eligibility, appropriate SA programs, and which defense
articles and equipment are permitted for transfer.

The post-9/11 period saw the rapid and piecemeal expansion of DOD SC
activities, mainly as temporary authorities that required annual renewal
in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The FY2017 NDAA (P.L.
114-328) consolidated and codified existing Title 10 SC authorities into
10 U.S.C. §§301-386. Other provisions aimed to make improvements to the
SC programs and themselves, as well as improvements in the management
and oversight of those programs. Key reforms from the FY2017 NDAA
included requirements for the following:  A consolidated DOD budget
request for Title 10 SC programs and activities (10 U.S.C. §381); the
first was released for FY2019.

>  Harmonized congressional notification requirements for most DOD
> train and equip programs (10 U.S.C. §333).
>
>  Institutional capacity building programs to strengthen partner
> defense institutions (10 U.S.C. §332).
>
>  A DOD SC Workforce Development Program to manage a professional
> workforce in support of SC programs and activities (10 U.S.C. §384).
>
>  A program of assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (AM&E) to be
> informed and supported by strategic evaluations on initial PN
> assessments, monitoring of implementation, and the efficiency and
> effectiveness of SC programs and activities (10 U.S.C. §383).

Congressional Role

[Congress provides]{.underline} the **[authority]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[funding]{.underline}** [for SC]{.underline}
programs. **[Title 10]{.underline}** [SC activities fall under the
jurisdiction of the]{.underline} **[armed services]{.underline}**
[committees, while]{.underline} **[Title 22]{.underline}**
(**[DOS]{.underline}**) **[SA]{.underline}** [activities are under the
jurisdiction of the]{.underline} **[Senate Foreign
Relations]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**House Foreign Affairs
committees**. Although the armed services committees are responsible for
the authorizing legislation for Title 10 SC programs, **both**
committees exercise **oversight** of SC activities and the management of
SC policy, including the level of coordination between DOD and
DOS]{.underline}. Funding for Title 10 SC programs and activities is
provided through annual appropriations bills, which originates in the
appropriations committees, specifically the defense subcommittees.

Primarily (but not solely) through these six committees, Congress plays
critical roles in the design and oversight of SC programs and in
ensuring that SC activities are aligned with and meeting U.S. national
security and foreign policy objectives. Pursuant to statutory
authorities, the executive branch must notify relevant committees on a
regular basis about some, but not all, SC activities. Congress can
exercise oversight roles in numerous ways, including determining how the
executive branch makes decisions for the export of military and dual-use
items, using annual authorizing legislation to establish temporary
authorities or modify the U.S. Code on an enduring basis, reviewing
proposed arms transfers and planned SC/SA activities and funding
obligations, mandating reports, and holding relevant hearings. The
Senate also influences SC through its advice and consent to the
ratification of relevant treaties.

DOD's FY2021 SC Budget Request, Authorizations, and Appropriations

The final FY2021 NDAA (P.L. 116-283) mostly maintained funding levels
from DSCA's FY2021 SC budget request, although some provisions identify
SC priority areas. In establishing the Pacific Deterrence Initiative
(PDI), the NDAA requires DOD activities, including SC, to prioritize the
Indo-Pacific region. The creation of PDI also indicates that the
Indo-Pacific will remain a priority for years to come. Other NDAA
provisions include a requirement for DOD to identify ways to enhance SC
in African countries, as well as amplify SC requirements from the Women,
Peace, and Security Act of 2017. The bill also amended DOD's main train
and equip program (10 U.S.C. §333) to add "air domain awareness
operations" and "cyberspace security and defensive cyberspace
operations" as authorized areas for support.

The final FY2021 Defense Appropriations bill (P.L. 116- 260) increased
funds for DSCA's base budget and slightly decreased its Overseas
Contingency Operations budget. The bill provides significant increases
for SC in both Africa Command's and Southern Command's areas of
responsibility (funds for both have declined since FY2017) and cuts
funding to both CTEF and ASFF (see Table 1).

DEVELOPMENT OF THE SECURITY COOPERATION STRUCTURE

[The concept of security cooperation in the U.S. originated during the
**American Revolution**]{.underline} and was a key to the success of the
early colonists in that war. [Since that time, the term has
**evolved**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[expanded]{.underline}**
into its present form. [In order to appreciate the **present
meaning**]{.underline} [and associated]{.underline}
**[complexity]{.underline}** [of security cooperation, it
is]{.underline} [important to understand how the concept and structures
that form it **developed**]{.underline} [into their]{.underline}
**[present form]{.underline}**.

Origins of U.S. Security Cooperation

[The]{.underline} **[first recorded security cooperation
actions]{.underline}** undertaken **[in the U.S.]{.underline}**
[were]{.underline} the **[diplomatic missions to France conducted by
Silas Deane and Benjamin Franklin]{.underline}** in 1775 and 1776.6 The
goal of these missions was [to]{.underline} **[secure French support to
defeat the British]{.underline}**. The French responded with military
and materiel support, which ultimately tilted the scales in favor of the
colonists. By the end of the Revolutionary War, the U.S. received over
\$9 million in foreign aid from European countries.7 [Although the U.S.
was the recipient]{.underline} of this assistance, [it nevertheless
represented a relationship **established with foreign
powers**]{.underline} [in **support of U.S. security interests**, which
is the]{.underline} **[essence of security cooperation]{.underline}**.
In this instance, France was building U.S. capability. The U.S. would
return the favor in years to come.

Evolution of Security Cooperation

As the United States grew physically and economically, so did its
security interests. Prior to actual entry into World War I, the U.S.
limited its aid to Europe to relief assistance, financial credits and
loans in an effort to maintain neutrality. The U.S. took a decidedly
more active role with the outbreak of World War II, beginning with the
repeal of the Neutrality Act in 1939.8 With the neutrality question put
to rest, the U.S. began shipping military equipment to its allies. Over
the course of World War II, the U.S. provided 37,000 tanks, 43,000
aircraft, 792,000 trucks, and 1.8 million rifles. The value of these
supplies was in excess of \$40 billion (in 1940s dollars).9 While U.S.
efforts during the war focused on military equipment for our allies,
after the war the U.S. focused on building the capacity of its allies.

In the aftermath of World War II, Europe's industrial base was largely
in ruins, it was unable to feed itself, and demobilizing armies resulted
in massive unemployment. The U.S. recognized that under these
conditions, Europe was vulnerable to influence from the Soviet Union.
The U.S. sought to rebuild Europe's economies through the Marshall Plan.
From 1948 to 1952, the U.S. provided \$13 billion in economic assistance
to Europe, Greece, and Turkey.10 While not solely responsible for
Europe's recovery from the war, the plan did significantly aid European
economies, and markedly assisted Germany's reintegration into Europe.
More importantly, the Marshall Plan significantly strengthened economic
ties between the U.S. and Europe, which served to reinforce the military
ties forged during the war. The tenets of the Marshall Plan would
reemerge in legislation nearly ten years after its conclusion.

In 1961, the U.S. Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA). The
act restructured the foreign assistance programs in existence at that
time, separating military from non-military assistance programs, and
established the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) to administer the non-military assistance programs.11
Additionally, the act provided that the Secretary of State "shall be
responsible for the continuous supervision and general direction of
economic assistance, military assistance, and military education and
training programs."12 Although the intent of this law was to simplify
security cooperation organization and clarify responsibilities within
the DOS, its effect in years to come would be the opposite.

[The]{.underline} **[Defense Reform Initiative]{.underline}**
[established the **term**]{.underline} [security cooperation
in]{.underline} [**1997**, and]{.underline}
**[reorganized]{.underline}** many [international assistance programs
administered by the DOD under the]{.underline} **[Defense Security
Assistance Agency]{.underline}** (DSAA). In 1998, DOD
**[redesignated]{.underline}** the DSAA [as the]{.underline} **[Defense
Security Cooperation Agency]{.underline}** (DSCA).13 [Although **many**
U.S. government agencies **share** roles in security cooperation,
the]{.underline} **[net effect]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the
**[legislative acts]{.underline}** described above [is that]{.underline}
**[DOS and DOD]{.underline}** [share the]{.underline} two **[key
roles]{.underline}**.

Current Security Cooperation Structure

While [security cooperation is a]{.underline} **[shared
effort]{.underline}** [between DOD and DOS]{.underline}, DOD has, by a
significant margin, the preponderance of personnel and organizational
structure that comprise the security cooperation infrastructure.
**[DOD]{.underline}** [defines security cooperation as "**all DOD
interactions with foreign defense and security establishments to build
defense relationships that promote specific US security
interests**]{.underline}, develop allied and friendly military and
security capabilities for internal and external defense and
multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
contingency access to the HN \[host nation\]."14 [It is important to
note that the DOD definition **includes** **developmental**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[humanitarian assistance]{.underline}** [activities
focused on enhancing **foreign** governments' abilities to **care for
their people**. The goal of all these activities is to **reduce** or
eliminate factors **leading** to a crisis or conflict that requires U.S.
intervention]{.underline}.15 **[Security assistance]{.underline}**
[activities are a **subset** of security cooperation and deal
principally with]{.underline} foreign military financing
(**[FMF]{.underline}**), foreign military sales (**[FMS]{.underline}**),
[and]{.underline} international military education and training
(**[IMET]{.underline}**) activities. The Deputy Undersecretary of
Defense for Policy has overall responsibility for the execution of DOD's
security cooperation activities, which DSCA administers.

The geographic combatant commands (GCC) form the regional level of DOD
security cooperation, and are responsible for planning, executing, and
administering security cooperation activities within their respective
regional areas. These activities typically include military-tomilitary
engagements, training exercises, and humanitarian assistance when so
directed.

[The]{.underline} **[DOS]{.underline}** [defines security cooperation
**along the lines**]{.underline} [of the DOD definition,
but]{.underline} often **[refers]{.underline}** [to it under the
umbrella of]{.underline} [**foreign assistance**. The Assistant
Secretary of State for Political Military affairs is **responsible for
the DOS slice of security cooperation**]{.underline} [and the Bureau for
Political-Military Affairs serves as the primary **link with DOD**.
Their mission statement provides a useful **illustration of their
definition of security cooperation**: "Political-Military Affairs
**integrates diplomacy and defense, and forges strong international
partnerships to meet shared security challenges**."]{.underline}16

DOS has no organization for security cooperation at the regional level
comparable to the GCC. The next level for DOS is the country level, the
locations of U.S. Missions or Embassies abroad. Led by the Ambassador or
Chief of Mission, each mission is responsible for supervising and
coordinating all U.S. programs in foreign countries. Each mission staff
has a Security Assistance Office with a small staff of DOD personnel who
work in coordination with the embassy staff to execute security
cooperation activities.

Article V

A collective security organization settles disputes among its members.
In contrast, a collective defense organization assists a member state
under attack by an outside country. [**NATO is a collective defense
organization**.]{.underline} Article V states that NATO members must
consider coming to the aid of an ally under attack. However, it does not
guarantee assistance. Article V is the Treaty\'s key provision and the
linchpin binding the United States to its NATO allies. It states, in
part, that \"an armed attack against one or more \[allies\] shall be
considered an attack against them all.\" Additional language makes clear
that the commitment to assist an ally is not unconditional. Rather, each
signatory will assist the ally under attack with \"such action it deems
necessary, including the use of armed force\....\"1 Since the early
1990s, NATO has begun to adopt \"new missions,\" such as crisis
management and peacekeeping, sometimes referred to as \"non-Article V
missions.\" Current members and candidate states, however, believe
collective defense, as expressed in Article V, remains the core of the
alliance, a view likely to endure as long as the possibility of a
nationalistic, aggressive Russia remains.

Potential Threats to NATO.

Threats to NATO can be conceptualized as two types. The first, external,
are nations or a collection thereof which threaten war or at least ill
will toward the NATO nations. Another external threat is instability of
a nonmember state which challenges NATO members directly (Afghanistan),
or indirectly (Kosovo), or potentially destabilizes an area of concern
(Sudan). The second type, internal, comes from an event, political
decision, or series of these which threatens the integrity of the
Alliance. This second type is a much more serious threat. NATO
out-of-area stability operations are debated within the Alliance. The
question is what level of force is NATO willing to engage to conduct
these operations? NATO has had its problems with caveats and the level
of kinetic force it is willing to employ. It is time that the member
states accept that **[NATO is an entity]{.underline}** of 28 nations
where decisions are based on consensus. NATO has to acknowledge that
there is little political will in many member states to use kinetic
force in these out-of-area operations. NATO can agree, however, that it
can contribute much in the area of humanitarian assistance in these
operations.

4.5 Conclusions

This chapter has described the institutional framework of NATO. [Member
States are **represented** in the]{.underline} North Atlantic Council
([NAC]{.underline}), [which is the highest political organ of the
Alliance.]{.underline} Decisions on NATO operations are taken by the
Council through consensus. The Secretary General of the Alliance is
responsible for steering this process of consultation and has several
tools at its disposal to achieve consensus, in particular the so-called
'silence procedure'. Consensus and the silence procedure show that NATO
enjoys a degree of autonomy from its member States, as the Alliance can
function even without full agreement of all of the members.

[The NAC, its supporting International Staff and the civilian agencies
**constitute the civilian structure** of the Alliance. The military
structure consists of the Military Committee, supported by the
International Military Staff, the two Supreme Commands and international
military headquarters subordinate to them.]{.underline} Supreme Allied
Commander Europe commands NATO operations. [SACEUR has "operational
command and control" over]{.underline} the [military forces]{.underline}
assigned to him by the Troop Contributing Nations, [which could
**either** be member States **or**]{.underline} States that are not
member to NATO ([Non-NATO Contributing Nations, or
**NNCN**]{.underline}). Two aspects are relevant to note here. First,
States that participate in NATO-led operations transfer a significant
degree of control over military forces to NATO. Chapter 7 will examine
in more detail whether the degree of control transferred to NATO by
States equates to 'effective control'. If NATO does have effective
control over conduct of forces placed at its disposal, the conduct can
be attributed to NATO. Secondly, [it is **relevant to note** that the
participation of NNCN in NATO-led operations show that **NATO is a
separate entity from its member States**. NNCN **do not** take part in
the decision-making process]{.underline} at the political level [and
neither have operational command and control]{.underline} over their
forces [once they are placed **under the authority** of SACEUR. This
illustrates that **NATO can act separately** from its **member States**
and enjoys a **high degree of autonomy**]{.underline}. This feature --
further examined in Chapter 5 -- speaks in favour of the existence of
international legal personality of NATO.

[The Allies seek to contribute to]{.underline} the efforts of the
international community in projecting [stability and]{.underline}
strengthening [security]{.underline} outside NATO territory. One of the
means to do so is [through **cooperation and
partnerships**]{.underline}. Over than 25 years, [the Alliance has
developed a **network of partnerships** with **non-member
countries**]{.underline} from the Euro-Atlantic area, the Mediterranean
and the Gulf region, and other partners across the globe. **[NATO
pursues]{.underline}** dialogue and practical [**cooperation** with
these nations on a wide range of]{.underline} political and
security-related [issues]{.underline}. NATO's partnerships are
beneficial to all involved and contribute to improved security for the
broader international community.

- Partners are part of many of NATO's core activities, from shaping
  policy to building defence capacity, developing interoperability and
  managing crises.

- NATO's programmes also help partner nations to develop their own
  defence and security institutions and forces.

- [In **partnering with NATO**, partners can]{.underline}:

- [share insights]{.underline} on areas of common interest or concern
  through political consultations and intelligence-sharing;

  - gain access to advice and support as they reform and strengthen
    defence institutions and capacities;

  - participate in a rich menu of education, training and consultation
    events (over 1,200 events a year are open to partners through a
    Partnership Cooperation Menu);

  - prepare together for future operations and missions by participating
    in exercises and training;

  - contribute to current NATO-led operations and missions;

  - share lessons learned from past operations and develop policy for
    the future;

  - work together with Allies on research and capability development.

- [Through partnership, **NATO and partners** also pursue a broad vision
  of security]{.underline}:

  - integrating gender perspectives into security and defence;

  - fighting against corruption in the defence sector;

  - enhancing efforts to control or destroy arms, ammunition and
    unexploded ordnance;

  - advancing joint scientific projects.

- Partnership has evolved over the years, to encompass more nations,
  more flexible instruments, and new forms of cooperation and
  consultation.

10 things you need to know about NATO

1.  Collective defence: [The **North Atlantic Treaty
    Organization**]{.underline} (NATO) was founded in 1949 and [is a
    **group of 30 countries** from Europe and North America that exists
    to protect the people and territory of its members]{.underline}. The
    Alliance is founded on the principle of collective defence, meaning
    that if one NATO Ally is attacked, then all NATO Allies are
    attacked. For example, when terrorists attacked the United States on
    9/11 2001, all NATO Allies stood with America as though they had
    also been attacked.

**That means the aff must cooperate with all of the NATO member states**

Unlike it happened with other political statements which had only
symbolic effects, as soon as the Global Strategy was issued work started
on identifying concrete measures to implement principles and remedy the
shortfalls and now with the definition of the European Defence Fund
(EDF) an instrument has been created to stimulate defence industries in
the EU countries, with possible far reaching effects on the political
willingness to integrate in a more effective and efficient way
individual military instruments.

[From the **operational point of view**, the first thing to achieve
is]{.underline} the [identification of the overall
capabilities]{.underline} the Union needs, [starting from the question
"What for?"]{.underline}, and [the answer **cannot be** just the
updating]{.underline}, once more, [of the HHG]{.underline}, since this
was specifically designed against the so called Petersberg Missionsi,
[leaving the task of common defence to NATO, **as if NATO is an entity
separated from its member states.**]{.underline}

European Command and NATO

[**EUCOM** and NATO]{.underline}, while strategically interconnected,
[are **different organizations** with **different missions**. NATO is an
**alliance of 30 nations** that are signatories to the 1949 **Washington
Treaty**]{.underline}; the United States is a NATO member. [U.S.
European Command, **by contrast**, is the focal point for the **United
States military's presence** in Europe. **Only some** of EUCOM's
activities **support NATO's operations** and activities]{.underline};
the remainder advance U.S. objectives with individual countries, across
the region, and across the Middle East and Africa, though they do
generally reinforce NATO as well. The complementary nature of these dual
roles and missions is one of the rationales behind dualhatting the
Commander of U.S. European Command as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander,
Europe.

### One = Divisible

**One is divisible absent hard limits**

In order to rescue the argument we should take Aristotle to be
suggesting that continuity is a way in which what is might be
one. [Some objects are one by being continuous: what makes
them one object, rather than many, is that each of their parts shares a
boundary or a limit with some other part.]{.underline}27
[But]{.underline} suppose that the Eleatics are entity monists. Then we
can easily understand why (in Aristotle's view) they cannot consistently
say that what is is one in this way. [If
the Eleatics' one entity is continuous, then it
is divisible into infinitely many parts, in which case there are many
entities, not one]{.underline}. The 'way of being one' reading
therefore gives Aristotle a good objection, whereas the 'sense of
"one"' reading does not.

We do not find any ambiguity in KRS 341.070(1). It is our opinion that
[the key word in the statute is the word \'in,\' preceding the words
\'each of three calendar quarters\',]{.underline} and if the word is
accorded its ordinary and common meaning, [the statute does not require
simultaneous employment. According to Webster\'s]{.underline} New
International [Dictionary, the word \'in,\' used with relation to a
period of time, means \'during the course of.\']{.underline} The same
meaning, expressed in another way, would be [\'within the limits or
duration of.\']{.underline} Employing this meaning, the statute says
that an employer is subject to the Act if, during the course of, or
within the limits or duration of each of three calendar quarters, he had
in covered employment four or more workers, to each of whom the required
amount of wages was paid. This clearly means that the employment need
not be simultaneous. [**Obviously, the word \'in\' does not mean
\'throughout\'** or \'for the entire period of,\' because then there
would be no point in adding the requirement of the payment of a minimum
of \$50 in wages.]{.underline} In these times, no worker employed for a
full calendar quarter would be paid less than \$50 in wages. The
appellant seeks to read into the statute the words \'at the same time,\'
following the words \'had in covered employment\'. There is no
justification for this, unless the word \'in\' means \'during any one
period of time in.\' [We are not aware of **any authority** for
ascribing such a meaning to the word \'in\']{.underline}.

**In is defined as the inclusion within a set of limits**

IN. In the law of real estate, this preposition has always been used to
denote the fact of seisin, title, or possession, and apparently serves
as an elliptical expression for some such phrase as \"in possession,\"
or as an abbreviation for \"intitled\" or \"invested with title.\" Thus,
in the old books, a tenant is said to be \"in by lease of his lessor.\"
Litt. § 82.

existence, situation, inclusion, action, etc.; [inclosed or surrounded

**"One" is indivisible.**

**Jakubowicz 99** -- PhD in Philosophy (The Trouble With Touching: A

The other possibility, and in my view the more reasonable one, stems
from the idea seen earlier that a unit is the measure of number dong
with the idea that units must be of the same kind. hnas claims that what
is meant by \'unit\' here is whatever is counted as \'one\'. Prior to
measuring, we must have a unit of meas\~rernent.\~\~ As well, lengths
are measured in units of length, weights of weight. etc? A unit is
regarded as indivisible for counting, though it may be divisible in
other arenas.32 For example, we see in Metaphysicu A that Aristotle
writes But the one is not the same in all classes. For here it is a
quartertone, and there it is the vowel or the consonant; and there is
another unit of weight and another of movement. But everywhere
the [**one is indivisible** either in **quantity** or in

Of: [The word \"of\"]{.underline} is a preposition. It is a word of
different meanings, and susceptible of numerous different connotations.
It may be used in its possessive sense to denote possession or
ownership. It may also be used as a word of identification and relation,
rather than as a word of proprietorship or possession. \"Of\" may denote
source, origin, existence, descent, or location, or it may denote that
from which something issues, proceeds, or is derived. The term [may
indicate the **aggregate** or **whole of**]{.underline} which the
limited word or words denote a part, or of which a part is referred to,

v. Private Frank Taylor, Jr.", United States Army Board of Review, 11
C.M.R. 428; 1953 CMR LEXIS 1428, 7-31, Lexis

Appellate defense counsel argued orally that many facts indicated the
United States was not at war, for example: there has been no declaration
of war; the Coast Guard is still under the supervision of the Treasury
Department instead of the Navy Department as it usually is during war;
here in the United States, Armed Forces personnel are allowed to wear
civilian clothes during off-duty hours; it is not the policy to try
Department of the Army civilians serving with the Army in the field in
the United States by courts-martial; the various Army posts throughout
the United States are still open to public visitation; many reservists
and National Guard units are not on active service; and the Table of
Maximum Punishments had not been suspended for offenses committed in the
United States. He contended that the ratio of the cases cited in support
of the war status of the United States was limited to the locale of the
hostilities, Korea and its adjacent \[\*\*6\]  waters, and was
inoperative on offenses committed in the United States. Finally, he
anchored his argument on the interpretation to be given the language in
Article 43f(1) (post) of the Code. He conceded arguendo that the offense
at bar fell within the purview of this language, being a fraud against a
United States agency, the Army, but reasoned that the subject language
contemplated and embraced only \"hostilities as proclaimed by the
President or by a Joint Resolution of Congress.\" With this
interpretation the board of review cannot agree. [The preposition \"of\"
before the word \"hostilities\" shows plainly that the phrase \"of
hostilities\" is **adjectival**, **qualifying** and **limiting** the
word \"termination\"]{.underline}. The phrase \"termination of
hostilities\" is in turn modified by the participial phrase \"as
proclaimed.\" In our interpretation it is the \"termination of
hostilities\" that must be proclaimed, and such proclamation provides
the initial date of a three-year period in which the suspension of the
statute of limitations continues to operate rather than determines the
date of the beginning of the original suspension (emphasis supplied).

OVERVIEW: The ISP made publicly available the internet search records of
more than 650,000 of its members. Under a service agreement, all
customers agreed to a forum selection clause that designated the
\"courts of Virginia\" as the fora for disputes between the ISP and its
customers. The ISP contended, and the district court agreed, that the
clause permitted plaintiffs to refile their consumer class action in
state or federal court in Virginia, but the customers contended the
forum selection clause limited them to Virginia state court, where a
class action remedy was unavailable; this violated California public
policy favoring consumer class actions and rendered the forum selection
clause unenforceable. [The court held that the use of the preposition
\"of\"]{.underline}\--rather than \"in\"\--[was determinative and that
the]{.underline} forum selection [clause referred to]{.underline} the
[state courts]{.underline} of Virginia [only, not]{.underline} the
[federal courts]{.underline} in Virginia. California had declared by
judicial decision the same forum selection clause contravened a strong
public policy of California\--as applied to California residents who
brought claims under California statutory consumer law in California
state court.

Defining AI. [**Artificial intelligence** is an **extremely broad

For clarity and to guide this project, [we use the term to mean a
**variety** of **information processing techniques** and technologies
used to perform a **goal-oriented task** and the **means to reason** in
the **pursuit** of that task.]{.underline} When referring to the wider
range of considerations, we use the term artificial intelligence (AI);
however, where we specifically address machine learning (ML) systems, we
refer to ML. Furthermore, we use the term "AI system" to mean systems
that have an AI component within an overall system or a system of
systems.14

A Diversity of Views. To aid the Department in this challenge, [**DoD
leadership** tasked the DIB to engage a **broad set of audiences** to
deliver recommendations]{.underline} on possible AI ethics principles
for DoD and how those principles might be integrated into the existing
ethics framework under which the Department executes its mission.

[The DIB conducted a **15-month study** designed to be **robust**,
**inclusive**, and **transparent**. The process involved collecting
**public commentary**]{.underline} both online and in person; [holding
two public listening sessions]{.underline} at major universities; [and
facilitating **three expert roundtable discussions** with **dozens of
subject matter experts** in **academia**, **industry**, **civil
society**, and the **Department**. Roundtable participants included
Turing Award-winning **AI researchers**, retired four-star **generals**,
human rights **attorneys**, **political theorists**, arms control
**activists**, **tech entrepreneurs**, and others]{.underline}.11
Additionally, the Department formed an informal DoD Principles and
Ethics Working Group, including government officials from close partner
nations, to assist the DIB in gathering information and promoting
cooperation. The DIB also held a classified "red team" session and a
Table Top Exercise to pressure-test the principles in realistic policy
scenarios and against current intelligence about potential applications
of AI in warfare. [After thoughtful consideration of the input of **more
than 100** internal and external experts]{.underline}, reflecting a wide
range of perspectives and almost 200 pages of submitted public
comments,12 [the DIB developed this set of proposed]{.underline} AI
Ethics [Principles]{.underline} and accompanying recommendations for
consideration by the Secretary of Defense. [These principles -- which
are intended to be **specific to AI** -- nest **within** the context of
the **existing**]{.underline} ethical, legal, and policy [**frameworks**

B. **[What is AI?]{.underline}**

[The FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act]{.underline} stipulates
that within one year, the Secretary of Defense "shall delineate a
definition of the term 'artificial intelligence' for use within the
Department."11 Furthermore, [for **working purposes**]{.underline}, the
Act [maintains that AI includes]{.underline}:

[(1) Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and
unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that
can learn from its experience and improve performance when exposed to
data sets.]{.underline}

[(2) An artificial system developed in computer software, physical
hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like
perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication or physical
action.]{.underline}

[(3) An artificial system designed to think or act like a human,
including cognitive architectures and neural networks.]{.underline}

[(4) A set of techniques, including machine learning, that is designed
to approximate a cognitive task.]{.underline}

[(5) An artificial system designed to act rationally, including an
intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using
perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating,
decision-making, and acting.]{.underline}

[However, **each definition individually carries**]{.underline} with it
policy and ethical [**challenges**, and attempting to **incorporate them
all yields an unwieldy definition** of AI. If we define "AI" **too
narrowly** or **too broadly,** we risk **limiting the scope of AI
capabilities** or **failing to specify** the **unique capacity** that AI
systems will have, respectively.]{.underline}

[The NDAA]{.underline}, while not committed to any one of these five
definitions, [does **explicitly favor** "human-like"
capacities]{.underline}, as well as human-like "thinking" or action (2,
3, 4, 5). [This move]{.underline}, however, [may be **limiting in
scope** for AI capabilities, for some systems may **require nonhuman
like capabilities**]{.underline}, such as sonar, various electromagnetic
sensing abilities, and other capabilities that exceed human performance
on a variety of tasks. [Limiting AI to **cognitive tasks (**4) may also
**limit various uses** of AI for physical task completion]{.underline},
where the repetitive physical task requires very little cognitive
abilities. Additionally, "[acting rationally" (5) may **unjustifiably
limit** a definition of AI to **prior arguments and assumptions** about
what constitutes **rationality**]{.underline}.12 For example, classic
Enlightenment thought takes a more robust approach to this, whereas
economists take a more minimal approach bordering on means-ends
reasoning. Yet, this is often contradicted by behavioral economics.

[For (1), this definition appears to **conflate autonomous systems and
AI systems**, while also **leaving open questions** pertaining to
systems that are **not dynamic**]{.underline} in their design and
architectures or non-learning systems. [It also **does not make any
indications** as to systems that may learn in a **supervised
setting**]{.underline}, but then after development and training are
"frozen" and not permitted to continually learn (i.e. life-long
learning). Furthermore, [the definition also seems to require AI to be
performing tasks without "**significant**" human oversight, but this
move **seems to unnecessarily marry the definition** to a rather
**contentious view** of autonomy.]{.underline}

definition does not preclude the DoD AI Strategy's approach, but allows
for a **wider range** of AI applications that **do not require** a
**human intelligence benchmark**]{.underline}. We have an extended
discussion of the various definitions for AI in several policy documents
in the Supporting Document.

\[\[End FN 13\]\]

For clarity and to guide this project, [we use the term to mean a
**variety** of **information processing techniques** and technologies
used to perform a **goal-oriented task** and the **means to reason** in
the **pursuit** of that task.]{.underline} When referring to the wider
range of considerations, we use the term artificial intelligence (AI);
however, where we specifically address machine learning (ML) systems, we
refer to ML. Furthermore, we use the term "AI system" to mean systems
that have an AI component within an overall system or a system of
systems.14

[We use this definition of AI because it comports with how DoD has
**viewed, developed**, and **deployed** **AI** systems over the **past
40 years**. It permits us to make **finer-grained distinctions** between
legacy systems and newer ones such as those using ML.]{.underline} The

### \-\--AT: DoD Def

#### The DoD definition is far too simplistic and ignores alternative, non-human modes of intelligence

The 2018 Department of Defense Strategy on Artificial Intelligence
defines AI as: "the ability of machines to perform tasks that normally
require human intelligence -- for example, recognizing patterns,
learning from experience, drawing conclusions, making predictions, or
taking action -- whether digitally or as the smart software behind
autonomous physical systems."

Much like the NDAA's proffered approaches, [the **DoD AI Strategy** also
privileges "**human intelligence**" as the foundation]{.underline} or
benchmark [by which to measure non-natural computational
systems]{.underline},13 though the types of tasks demarcated in the DoD
AI Strategy are not solely in the domain of human experience or
expertise. Additionally, as written, there is no difference between the
objects in the final clause because software runs on digital
information.

[The general tasks of pattern recognition, learning, offering
probabilistic predictions or estimations, or "taking action" are only a
small subset of abilities that a variety of nonhuman organic entities,
such as higher-order mammals but also distributed complex organic
systems like bees and ants, can perform. Mammals, birds, insects, and
reptiles all appear to be able to have varying capacities of
planning]{.underline} (as a function of episodic memory), [causal
reasoning, and deceptive capabilities]{.underline}, while others display
transitive inference, and teaching/imitation. The important point is
that [there are a variety of natural minds in the world that display
various degrees of these same capabilities, and they are in no way
limited to human beings]{.underline}, or that humans have the monopoly
on them. The differences between human and animal cognition may be down
to the ways in which their brains function, and [as we have no full
comprehension of how a machine mind functions, it would be premature to
attempt to 1) emulate human brains in computational systems and 2)
expect that the computational system will "think" like a human. There is
danger in anthropomorphizing the system]{.underline}, in both how humans
interact with it, but also how we "expect" it to behave.14

#### Autonomous weapons can exist with or without AI

committee that provides advice and recommendations to DoD senior leaders

Defense Innovation Board, \"AI Principles: Recommendations on the
Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence by the Department of Defense:
Supporting Document,\" Defense Innovation
Board, 2019, https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/31/2002204459/-1/-1/0/DIB_AI_PRINCIPLES_SUPPORTING_DOCUMENT.PDF

What is different about AI

In some respects, AI is different in degree, rather than kind. Some of
the aspects noted below exist for other technologies but carry with them
ethical ambiguities or risks that their technological forerunners do
not. Notwithstanding, there are direct benefits from using AI that other
systems cannot achieve. These benefits include increased situational
awareness, higher quality data for decision-making, increased speed for
decision making and planning, streamlining business processes, and
increasing safety and reliability of DoD equipment through predictive
maintenance and advances in material sciences. What counts as a benefit
or a risk, however, depends on the maturity of the technology, its
testing and evaluation, the context of its use, and various design
features, such as user interfaces. Therefore, what is new about AI is
the following:

Augments or replaces human judgment. [AI is an **information-processing
technology** that can **augment or substitute** for human cognition and
abilities.]{.underline}24 For moral and legal purposes, the use of force
requires human deliberation, and [it is DoD policy that **autonomous
weapons systems** -- **with or without AI** -- will ensure appropriate
human judgment and not replace it.]{.underline} However, for other AI
use cases, such as the use of ML for personnel decisions, logistics
planning, or predictive maintenance, the system may replace as well as
augment human judgment in various aspects of a task.

#### They also define autonomy too narrowly

**DIB 19** -- Defense Innovation Board, an independent federal advisory
committee that provides advice and recommendations to DoD senior leaders

Defense Innovation Board, \"AI Principles: Recommendations on the
Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence by the Department of Defense:
Supporting Document,\" Defense Innovation
Board, 2019, https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/31/2002204459/-1/-1/0/DIB_AI_PRINCIPLES_SUPPORTING_DOCUMENT.PDF

We should also make clear that [**AI is not the same thing as
autonomy**. While **some** autonomous systems **may utilize AI** in
their software architectures, this is **not always the
case**]{.underline}. The interaction between AI and autonomy, even if it
is not a weapon system, carries with it ethical considerations. Indeed,
it is likely that most of these types of systems will have nothing to do
with the application of lethal force, but will be used for maintenance
and supply, battlefield medical aid and assistance, logistics,
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and humanitarian and
disaster relief operations. Various ethical dimensions may arise
depending upon the system and its domain of use, and those will change
depending upon context.

DoD's policy regarding autonomy in weapons systems comes from the 2012
[DoD Directive (**DoDD) 3000.09**]{.underline}. There, DoD defines an
autonomous weapons system (AWS) as:

> "a weapon system that, once activated, can select and engage targets
> without further intervention by a human operator. This includes
> human-supervised autonomous weapons systems that are designed to allow
> human operators to override operation of the weapon system, but can
> select and engage targets without further human input after
> activation."15

Here autonomy is limited to the ability of a system to act without
direction and intervention by a human during target engagement. A human
may watch or supervise a system, but that system can carry out a
commander's intent and its task without any further guidance. How it
does so is not specified; it is the behavior that is autonomous. Thus,
DoDD 3000.09 does not explicitly address AI as such, but the Directive
is broad enough to cover autonomous systems run on AI.16

Another approach to autonomy comes from the 2016 Defense Science Board's
(DSB) "Summer Study on Autonomy." Here, the focus was on autonomy as
such, and not its particular application in weapons systems. The DSB
defines autonomy to be:

> "The capability to independently compose and select among different
> courses of action to accomplish goals based on its knowledge and
> understanding of the world, itself, and the situation."17

Further, the Study also importantly notes that:

"Autonomy results from the delegation of a decision to an authorized
entity to take action within specific boundaries."18

What is crucial to note in the Directive['s approach to autonomy is the
**requisite feature** that a weapons system can **independently "select
and engage**" a target.]{.underline} What ultimately constitutes
"selection" as opposed to "detection" is open for discussion. [However,
this approach to **defining autonomy is narrow.**]{.underline}

If, however, one takes existing DoD policy as determining which weapon
systems are autonomous and which are not, then this opens the aperture
quite wide to include many systems that can function without
intervention of a human operator, and those may or may not have AI as
part of that system. [The way in which the Directive circumscribes this
wide aperture is that it **excludes a wide variety** of types of systems
that would **still ontologically fit** the definition]{.underline}.19
For instance, [the Directive excludes "unarmed, unmanned platforms;
unguided munitions; munitions manually guided by the
operator]{.underline} (e.g., laser- or wireguided munitions); [mines; or
unexploded explosive ordnance]{.underline}."20 [Thus systems like the
U.S. Army Claymore mine, the U.S. Navy MK-60 CAPTOR mine, and the U.S.
Navy Quickstrike Mine family]{.underline} (MKs 62, 63, and 65) [are
**excluded**]{.underline}. [However, systems such as the U.S. Air Force
CQM-121A Pave Tiger and the YGCM-121B Seek Spinner]{.underline}, both
unmanned aerial vehicles with anti-radar munitions, [would **constitute
autonomous weapons** (per the Directive) **without AI**.]{.underline}21
A deployed contemporary of Pave Tiger and Seek Spinner would be the
Israeli Harpy and Israeli Harop anti-radar loitering munitions.

by August 13, 2019, no official U.S. government definition of AI yet
exists. 6 [The **FY2019 NDAA** does]{.underline}, however, [provide a
**definition of AI**]{.underline} for the purposes of Section 238:

1\. Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and
unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that
can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data
sets.

[2. An **artificial system** developed in computer software, physical
hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring **human-like**
perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical
action.]{.underline}

[3. An artificial system **designed to think or act like a human**,
including **cognitive architectures** and **neural
networks.**]{.underline}

[4. A set of techniques, including machine learning that is designed to
**approximate a cognitive task.**]{.underline}

[5. An artificial system designed to **act rationally**, including an
intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using
perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating,
decision-making, and acting.7]{.underline}

**It's defined by intelligence and ability to solve real-world
problems**

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) is growing across a wide range
of sectors. Stakeholders and policymakers have called for careful
consideration of strategies to influence its growth, reap predicted
benefits, and mitigate potential risks. [This document provides an
overview of **AI technologies** and applications]{.underline}, recent
private and public sector activities, and selected issues [of **interest
to Congress**.]{.underline}

AI Technologies and Applications

Though definitions vary, [AI can **generally be thought** of as
**computerized systems** that work and react in ways **commonly
thought** **to require intelligence**, such as **solving complex
problems** in real-world situations]{.underline}. According to the
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI),
[researchers broadly seek to understand "the mechanisms **underlying
thought** and **intelligent behavior** and their embodiment in
machines."]{.underline}

[The field of AI encompasses many methodologies]{.underline} and areas
of emphasis, [such as **machine learning** (ML), **deep learning**,
**neural networks**, **robotics**, machine/computer vision (**image
processing**), and **natural language processing**]{.underline}.
Advances in these areas, in information processing and hardware
technology generally, and in the availability of large-scale data sets,
have all contributed to recent progress in AI.

**It involves replicating human cognition**

**[Artificial intelligence]{.underline}** (AI[), a set of techniques

improve inefficiencies and inaccuracies]{.underline} in diagnosis and
laboratory testing, and to facilitate an anticipated decreasing number
of pathologists' ability to serve an increasing number of patients with
timely diagnoses, even as those diagnoses exhibit an increasingly
complicated molecular complexity.2--4 Pathology has long examined the
use of AI in pathologic diagnosis5 and is already using AI. Papanicolaou
test imaging, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
screening purposes, is now fully, if not widely, used.6,7 Other areas of
cytopathology are investigating the use of AI for diagnosis,8 and AI
will undoubtedly play a strong and central role in its continuing
progress toward becoming fully automated.9--11 Artificial intelligence
in pathology promises to outperform human beings in their assessment of
the specific characteristics necessary for pathologic and radiologic
diagnosis.9,12 Despite the initial hysteria,13--16 it is now clear that
AI will be, at least for the foreseeable future, a tool for
pathologists, not a replacement for pathologists, and it is evident that
although AI's use will fundamentally alter pathology practice, it is
perhaps pathologists' greatest opportunity to invest themselves more
fully in their patients' care.3,7 Pathologists' success with AI,
however, will depend to a large degree on the successful implementation
of efficient AI governance and regulation.

Terrorist groups are increasingly using 21st-century technologies,
including drones and elementary artificial intelligence (AI), in
attacks. [As it continues to be weaponized, AI could prove a formidable
threat, allowing adversaries --- including nonstate actors --- to
automate killing on a massive scale]{.underline}. The combination of
drone expertise and more sophisticated AI could allow terrorist groups
to acquire or develop lethal autonomous weapons, or "killer robots,"
which would dramatically increase their capacity to create incidents of
mass destruction in Western cities. As it expands its artificial
intelligence capabilities, the U.S. government should also strengthen
its anti-AI capacity, paying particular attention to nonstate actors and
the enduring threats they pose. For the purposes of this article, [I
**define artificial intelligence** as technology capable of "**mimicking
human brain patterns**," including by learning and making
decisions.]{.underline}

I. BACKGROUND

A. [What Is AI?]{.underline}

There is no straightforward, consensus definition of artificial
intelligence. [**AI is best understood** as a set of techniques aimed at
approximating some aspect of **human or animal cognition** using
machines.]{.underline} Early theorists conceived of symbolic systems ---
the organization of abstract symbols using logical rules --- as the most
fruitful path toward computers that can "think."18 But the approach of
building a reasoning machine upon which to scaffold all other cognitive
tasks, as originally envisioned by Turing and others, did not deliver
upon initial expectations. What seems possible in theory has yet to
yield many viable applications in practice.19

Defining AI. [**Artificial intelligence**]{.underline} is an extremely
broad discipline, defined in many different ways for many different
purposes.13

For clarity and to guide this project, we use the term to mean a variety
of information processing techniques and technologies used to perform a
goal-oriented task and the means to reason in the pursuit of that task.
[When referring to the **wider range of considerations**, we use the
term **artificial intelligence** (AI);]{.underline} however, where we
specifically address machine learning (ML) systems, we refer to ML.
Furthermore, [we use the term "**AI system**" to mean systems that have
an AI component **within an overall system** or a system of
systems]{.underline}.14

2.1 Introduction

[The field of biotechnology has been **rigorously researched** and
applied to **many facets** of everyday life. **Biotechnology is
defined** as the **process of modifying an organism** or a **biological
system** for an intended purpose]{.underline}. Biotechnology
applications range from agricultural crop selection to pharmaceutical
and genetic processes (Bauer and Gaskell 2002). [The
definition]{.underline}, however, [**is evolving** with recent
scientific advancements.]{.underline} Until World War II, biotechnology
was primarily siloed in agricultural biology and chemical engineering.
The results of this era included disease resistant crops, pesticides,
and other pest-controlling tools (Verma et al. 2011). After WWII,
biotechnology began to shift domains when advanced research on human
genetics and DNA started. In 1984, the Human Genome Project (HGP) was
formerly proposed, which initiated the pursuit to decode the human
genome by the private and academic sectors. The legacy of the project
gave rise to ancillary advancements in data sharing and open-source
software, and solidified the prominence of "big science;" solidifying
capital-intensive large-scale private-public research initiatives that
were once primarily under the purview of governmentfunded programs (Hood
and Rowen 2013). After the HGP, the biotechnology industry boomed as a
result of dramatic cost reduction to DNA sequencing processes. In 2019
the industry was globally estimated to be worth \$449.06 billion and is
projected to increase in value (Polaris 2020).

### \-\--Coop Context

**The CBD definition is best in the biotechnology and cooperation
context**

\*\*\*Also NATO context\*\*\*

and Toxin Weapons
Convention, 2000, https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-94-017-3643-5.pdf

[The **Convention on Biological Diversity** (CBD) was opened for
signature at the Rio Summit and entered into force in December
1993]{.underline}. Article I of the CBD states that:

> \"The objectives of this Convention, to be pursued in accordance with
> its relevant provisions, are the conservation of biological diversity,
> the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable
> sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic
> resources, including by appropriate access to genetic resources and by
> appropriate transfer of relevant technologies, taking into account all
> rights over those resources and to technologies, and by appropriate
> funding.\"

Several sections of the Convention are directly relevant to the peaceful
uses of microbiology and biotechnology. **[Biotechnology is
defined]{.underline}** broadly [in Article 2 as:]{.underline}

> [\"Biotechnology means any **technological application** that uses
> **biological systems,** **living organisms**, or derivatives thereof,
> to **make or modify products** or processes for specific
> use.\"]{.underline}

[whilst Article 16]{.underline} Access to and Transfer of Technology
[requires that:]{.underline}

> \"I. [Each Contracting Party, recognizing that **technology includes
> biotechnology**,]{.underline} and that both access to and transfer of
> technology among Contracting Parties are essential elements for the
> attainment of the objectives of the Convention, [undertakes subject to
> the provisions of this Article to]{.underline} provide and/or
> [**facilitate access for and transfer to** other Contracting parties
> of **technologies**]{.underline} \.... \"

[and]{.underline} goes on to say [that:]{.underline}

> \"2. [Access to and transfer of technology]{.underline} referred to in
> paragraph 1 above to developing countries [shall be provided and/or
> facilitated under fair and most favorable terms]{.underline} \... .In
> the case of technology subject to patents and other intellectual

> which recognize and are consistent with the adequate and effective

>
> 3\. Each Contracting Party shall take legislative, administrative or
> policy measures, as appropriate, with the aim that Contracting
> parties, in particular those that are developing countries, \.... are
> provided access to and transfer of technology .. .including technology
> protected by patents and other intellectual property rights \.... \"

[It is **thus apparent** that]{.underline} there is considerable
potential for overlap between the CBD and the BTWC. In addition, there
are other CBD initiatives - the clearing house and the biosafety
protocol - which are relevant to Article X of the BTWC which are being
progressed satisfactorily under the auspices of the CBD. As the BTWC is
primarily a security treaty, [it would seem **appropriate** to **utilize
the CBD** as the **primary treaty** to **promote biotechnology
transfer** for **peaceful purposes**.]{.underline} As an aside, it is
worth noting that the UK Government has mounted the Darwin Initiative in
which about £3M a year is made available to British institutions to work
with developing countries to help the developing countries meet their
obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity. This would
appear to be a model that might with advantage be considered further in
addressing how States Parties to the BTWe might be assisted in meeting
their obligations to a strengthened BTWe.

Summary

[**Biotechnology** **refers primarily** to the use of **recombinant DNA
techniques** to **genetically modify** or **bioengineer** plants and
animals.]{.underline} Most crops developed through recombinant DNA
technology have been engineered to be tolerant of various herbicides or
to be pest resistant through having a pesticide genetically engineered
into the plant organism. U.S. soybean, cotton, and corn farmers have
rapidly adopted genetically engineered (GE) varieties of these crops
since their commercialization in the mid-1990s. Over the past 15 years,
GE varieties in the United States have increased from 3.6 million
planted acres to 173 million acres in 2013. Worldwide, 27 countries
planted GE crops on approximately 433 million acres in 2013. GE
varieties now dominate soybean, cotton, and corn production in the
United States, and they continue to expand rapidly in other countries,
particularly in Latin America.

### \-\--AT: CBD Definition

**It's reasonable and predictable to define biotechnology either way, so
prefer a limited definition**

**FAO 0** -- Food and Agriculture Organization

FAO, \"FAO Statement on Biotechnology,\" United Nations, March
2000, https://www.fao.org/biotech/fao-statement-on-biotechnology/en/#:\~:text=FAO%20recognizes%20that%20genetic%20engineering,food%20to%20feed%20their%20people.

Biotechnology provides powerful tools for the sustainable development of
agriculture, fisheries and forestry, as well as the food industry. When
appropriately integrated with other technologies for the production of
food, agricultural products and services, biotechnology can be of
significant assistance in meeting the needs of an expanding and
increasingly urbanized population in the next millennium.

[There is a **wide array of \"biotechnologies\"** with different
techniques and applications]{.underline}. The Convention on Biological
Diversity (CBD) defines biotechnology as:

*\"any technological application that uses biological systems, living
organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or
processes for specific use\".*

[**Interpreted in this broad sense**, the definition of biotechnology
covers many]{.underline} of the [tools]{.underline} and techniques that
are commonplace [in **agriculture** and **food production.**
**Interpreted in a narrow sense**, which considers **only** the new
**DNA techniques**, **molecular biology** and **reproductive
technological applications**, the definition covers a **range of
different technologies** such as **gene manipulation** and **gene
transfer**, **DNA typing** and **cloning** of plants and
animals.]{.underline}

### \-\--Core of Topic

**It's the core controversy of biotechnology in the security context**

Genetic Warfare,\" Strategic Studies Quarterly, Fall
2021, https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-15_Issue-3/Biberman.pdf

[The **US security establishment** is also beginning to take the
promises and perils of the **biotechnology revolution** seriously, and
there have been calls for a **national strategy**]{.underline}.6 [The US
intelligence community's]{.underline} (IC) [2016 worldwide threat
assessment **singled out genome editing**]{.underline}: "[Research in
**genome editing**]{.underline} conducted by countries with different
regulatory or ethical standards than those of Western countries
[probably increases the risk of the creation of **potentially harmful
biological agents** or products]{.underline}."7 The IC predicted,
however, that researchers will "continue to encounter challenges to
achieve the desired outcome of their genome modifications, in part
because of the technical limitations that are inherent in available
genome editing systems."8

## Cybersecurity

### \-\--Aff\-\--

### Cybersec = Sec of Cyberspace

**Cybersecurity is the security of cyberspace\-\--there is no agreed
upon definition, so prefer a broad, policy-oriented definition**

**Jaikaran 20** -- Analyst in Cybersecurity Policy

Chris Jaikaran, \"Cybersecurity: A Primer,\" Congressional Research
Service, 12-15-2020, https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/2020-12-15_IF10559_1d7e5206bb579bce86b7889e28a8ae293466a517.pdf

[The **Nature of Cybersecurity**]{.underline}

[The term "cyber" is frequently attached to a variety of security
issues, underscoring that issues surrounding]{.underline} the management
of [cyberspace and its security are **big** and
**complicated**.]{.underline}

As an example, consider a single smartphone. An American company may
have designed the device, but the device may be built by a different
company abroad using material from yet another country. The phone runs
on software built by one company but modern operating systems borrow
code from other companies and developers. Once a user has the device it
will likely be connected to a variety of networks such as a home
wireless network, a corporate network, and a cellular network. Each of
these networks has its own infrastructure, but also share common
internet infrastructure. The user will also install applications that
contain code and use infrastructure by yet other myriad companies.
Imagining users at the center, one can see large and intricate systems
on one side and the other to create these devices and ensure those
devices work.

[To highlight **how complicated it is**, consider that the federal
government **does not have a single definition** of cyberspace or
cybersecurity.]{.underline} Recently, the Cyberspace Solarium
Commission---defined "cyber" as

> Relating to, involving, or characteristic of computers, computer
> networks, information and communications technology (ICT), virtual
> systems, or computer-enabled control of physical components.

While this definition may be suitable for a broad discussion about
information technology, it does not account for relevant policymaking
considerations concerning cybersecurity. [Essentially, **cybersecurity
is the security of cyberspace.**]{.underline}

When users go [online]{.underline} they might work with their bank, get
their email, conduct business, or get the news by accessing services.
But those [services don't exist independently. Those services rely on a
**common infrastructure** of servers and switches, miles of cabling,
wireless spectrum, and routers]{.underline}. That same infrastructure is
used by other services too, such as utilities and shipping to ensure
products arrive as intended---or by businesses to develop new products
more efficiently and manage their operations. [The **entire
infrastructure** and **all those services**]{.underline} that [are
**part of cyberspace**]{.underline} exist to deliver an experience to a
user, a human.

Thus, [from a **policymaking standpoint** cybersecurity can be
considered the **security of cyberspace**---which includes the
**devices, infrastructure, data,** and **users** that make it
up.]{.underline} To support cybersecurity policymaking, adjacent fields
also need consideration. Education, workforce management, investment,
entrepreneurship, and research and development are necessary to get a
product to market. Developers, law enforcement, intelligence, incident
response, and national defense are necessary to respond when something
goes awry in cyberspace.

Cyber threats to the security of the Alliance are complex, destructive
and coercive, and are becoming ever more frequent. NATO will continue to
adapt to the evolving cyber threat landscape. NATO and its Allies rely
on strong and resilient cyber defences to fulfil the Alliance's core
tasks of collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security.
The Alliance needs to be prepared to defend its networks and operations
against the growing sophistication of the cyber threats it faces.

- Cyber defence is part of NATO's core task of collective defence.

- NATO Allies have affirmed that international law applies in
  cyberspace.

- NATO\'s main focus in cyber defence is to protect its own networks,
  operate in cyberspace (including through the Alliance's operations and
  missions), help Allies to enhance their national resilience and
  provide a platform for political consultation and collective action.

- In July 2016, [Allies reaffirmed NATO's defensive mandate and
  recognised cyberspace as a domain of operations in which NATO must
  defend itself]{.underline} as effectively as it does in the air, on
  land and at sea.

Strategic Competition In Cyberspace

The United States' strategic competitors are conducting cyber-enabled
campaigns to erode U.S. military advantages, threaten our
infrastructure, and reduce our economic prosperity. The Department must
respond to these activities by exposing, disrupting, and degrading cyber
activity threatening U.S. interests, strengthening the cybersecurity and
resilience of key potential targets, and working closely with other
departments and agencies, as well as with our allies and partners.

First, [we must ensure the U.S. **military's ability** to fight and win
wars in **any domain**, **including cyberspace**. This is a foundational
requirement for]{.underline} U.S. national [security and a key to
ensuring that we **deter aggression**, including **cyber
attacks**]{.underline} that constitute a use of force, against the
United States, our allies, and our partners. The Department must defend
its own networks, systems, and information from malicious cyber activity

"Russia is constantly pushing its cyber and information operations,"
said Wheelbarger, adding that this is a way for the U.S. to show its
continued commitment to NATO.

[**NATO Secretary-General** Jens Stoltenberg told reporters]{.underline}
on Wednesday that [the inclusion of **offensive cyber
operations**]{.underline} in alliance missions "[is just one of many
elements in our **strengthened NATO cyber defenses**]{.underline}." And
he said that it's important to have cyber capabilities that can be used
against the Islamic State group to destroy the networks they use for
recruiting, financing and communicating.

[Until recently, NATO and member states, including the United States,
have relied on **strictly defensive cyber tools**]{.underline} to
protect their infrastructure. [However]{.underline}, given that this
approach has done little to discourage hostile actors, the strategic
value of incorporating offensive cyber operations has long been
discussed. In late 2017, [Stoltenberg announced that NATO would
**integrate cyber weapons**]{.underline} of its members into military
operations [to **deter** and **defend** **against
threats**]{.underline}, marking the "biggest overall policy shift in
decades," according to officials.\[22\]

The U.S. decision to commit offensive and defensive capabilities to NATO
follows on the heels of this move. The addition of offensive cyber tools
to the defense and deterrence toolbox is not only new for NATO, it also
tracks a recent shift in the U.S. posture. The White House authorized
the use of offensive cyber weapons to deter foreign adversaries in
September with the publication of the Department of Defense's 2018 Cyber
Strategy.\[23\] [The strategy]{.underline} also [incorporates a new
mission of "**defending forward**" as a means to "disrupt or **halt
malicious cyber activity** at its source]{.underline}, including
activity that falls below the level of armed conflict."\[24\] [While
defending forward is]{.underline}, as the name suggests, [**defensive in
nature**, it entails targeting foreign cyberspace infrastructure to
**pre-empt incoming attacks** through **offensive cyber
operations.**]{.underline}

**Definitions of "cyber" don't cut it\-\--ignores policymaking-specific

To highlight how complicated it is, consider that the federal government
does not have a single definition of cyberspace or cybersecurity.
Recently, [the Cyberspace Solarium Commission]{.underline}---**[defined
"cyber"]{.underline}** as

> Relating to, involving, or characteristic of computers, computer
> networks, information and communications technology (ICT), virtual
> systems, or computer-enabled control of physical components.

[While this definition **may** be suitable for a **broad
discussion**]{.underline} about information technology, [it **does not
account** for **relevant policymaking considerations** concerning
**cybersecurity**.]{.underline} Essentially, cybersecurity is the
security of cyberspace.

### AT: Cybersec = Defensive

**Offensive cyber operations are a part of cybersecurity\-\--they
prevent cyberattacks**

**M.W. 21** -- regularly writes about technology, business continuity,

\*\*\*we do not endorse ableist language\*\*\*

[Governments]{.underline} and corporations [have realized that a
**passive, defensive approach** to **cybersecurity** has limited
success]{.underline}. Instead, [there is **growing recognition** of the
need for **persistent engagement** that **infiltrates and degrades** an
attacker's systems and infrastructure]{.underline}. Also known as
hacking back, [**offensive cybersecurity operations** refer to the
**proactive attack** on hackers to]{.underline} cripple or [disrupt
their operations and deter future attacks. Offensive cybersecurity has
the advantage of **stopping or preempting cyberattacks** before they
impair target systems or penetrate cyber-defenses.]{.underline} The
operations can also introduce uncertainty in an attacker in addition to
influencing their behavior.

Despite its merits, offensive cybersecurity is not without significant
risks. Before developing and executing an offensive cybersecurity
strategy, it is essential you recognize the different ways things can go
wrong.

### AT: Cybersec = Privacy

[**Cybersecurity** is also sometimes **conflated
inappropriately**]{.underline} in public discussion [with **other
concepts** such as **privacy**]{.underline}, information sharing,
intelligence gathering, and surveillance. [Privacy is associated with
the ability of an individual person to **control access by others** to
information about that person. Thus, good cybersecurity **can** **help**
**protect privacy** in an electronic environment, but
information]{.underline} that is [shared to assist in cybersecurity
efforts might]{.underline} sometimes **[contain]{.underline}** personal
[**information** that]{.underline} at least [some]{.underline} observers
would **[regard as private]{.underline}**. Cybersecurity can be a means
of protecting against undesired surveillance of and gathering of
intelligence from an information system. However, when aimed at
potential sources of cyberattacks, such activities can also be useful to
help effect cybersecurity. In addition, surveillance in the form of
monitoring of information flow within a system can be an important
component of cybersecurity.4

### AT: Cybersec = Data Security

**Data security is only one part of cybersecurity**

**Kosseff 18** -- Assistant Professor of Cybersecurity Law, United
States Naval Academy. J.D., Georgetown University Law Center; M.P.P.,
B.A., University of Michigan

Jeff Kosseff, \"Defining Cybersecurity Law,\" 103 Iowa L. Rev. 985

**[Cybersecurity often is conflated]{.underline}**, particularly in
legal circles, [with **data security**. Although data security is an
**important part** of cybersecurity, it is **only one part**.
Cybersecurity focuses **not only** on the protection of data, but also
on the **systems** and **networks** of the public and private
sector.]{.underline} In other words, [cybersecurity **involves more**
than **merely** the protection of **data**.]{.underline}

[Consider]{.underline}, for example, [the]{.underline} 2016 Distributed
Denial of Service ("[DDOS]{.underline}") [attack on Dyn]{.underline}, a
relatively obscure but exceptionally important company that provides a
large portion of the domain name system that directs traffic on the
Internet. A DDOS attack floods a targeted server with traffic from
multiple sources, causing a slowdown in traffic or a complete shutdown.
Due to the DDOS attack on Dyn, Netflix, Twitter, and other popular
online services were unavailable for the majority of a day. [Although
the attack resulted in **some data** being unavailable, it would **not
be characterized** as a traditional **data security compromise**.
Instead, it was an attack that **compromised an entire
network.**]{.underline} Laws focused exclusively on data---rather than
networks and systems---will do little to prevent and remediate harms
such as the Dyn attack.

[To be sure, data security is a **vital component** of
cybersecurity]{.underline}. For instance, [the attack on Sony
compromised a significant amount of]{.underline} the company's valuable
[data]{.underline}, including confidential emails and unreleased movies.
That aspect of the attack attracted a great deal of publicity. [However,
Sony **also** suffered great business harm due to the **unavailability**
of its **systems** and **networks**. The attack]{.underline} on Sony, in
other words, [was **not merely** an attack on]{.underline} the company's
[data security. It was a **comprehensive attack** on Sony's
**cybersecurity**]{.underline}. The attack compromised more than just
the confidentiality of Sony's information, though it certainly had that
effect as well. The attack compromised the fundamental ability of Sony
to carry out its routine business operations.

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has shattered]{.underline} many illusions.
One of them is [the idea that skill in **offensive cyber operations**
can **ever** **be a substitute** for reliable computer and information
systems.]{.underline}

There are lessons for the United States. [**Cybersecurity** is not about
who can do the **flashiest hacks** but about how to **keep our networks
safe**.]{.underline} [This is difficult because it requires]{.underline}
powerful interests in the government and the private sector to invest
resources and make **[trade-offs]{.underline}** they would rather not
make. [An **offense-based strategy**]{.underline} that appears "tough"
[hides these **trade-offs** while actually making U.S. **cybersecurity
worse**.]{.underline}

Illusions of deterrence

Cyberwar strategists have described cyber conflict as a kind of
asymmetric warfare that puts advanced societies at a strategic
disadvantage. [**Offense is easy**, while **defense is
hard**]{.underline}. The United States is in a uniquely tough position.
Multiple skilled adversaries---Russia, China, North Korea, Iran--- are
ready to attack the United States' modern, internet-dependent society.
Meanwhile, U.S. political and economic culture is hostile to the
regulation and public spending that are needed to stop data breaches,
protect online privacy, and make networks safe.

Conclusion

In short, although the Administration should continue to make use of
diplomacy, sanctions, and law enforcement actions to reduce the threat
of cyberattacks, these efforts are not sufficient. Similarly, [efforts
to improve]{.underline} the **[cybersecurity]{.underline}** of U.S.
critical infrastructure [are **likely to fall short** in the face of
attacks sponsored by nation-states.]{.underline} The Administration and
[Congress should **instead** continue and expand]{.underline} President
Trump's approach by using [**offensive cyber operations** to degrade
adversaries' capabilities and create credible deterrence]{.underline}.
The Administration should disclose more information about these
operations to discourage adversaries from attacking, and Congress should
consider structural changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of U.S. offensive cyber operations.
