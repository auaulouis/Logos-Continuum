http://www.visualthesaurus.com/cm/wordroutes/the-united-states-is-or-are/

We\'re coming up on the Fourth of July, when the United States is full
of barbecues, fireworks, parades, and competitive hot dog eating. But
[why do we say \"the United States is full of\...\" instead of \"the
United States are\"?]{.underline} On Independence Day, there\'s no
better time to reflect on how [the rise of America\'s national unity was
mirrored by its **grammatical unity**, as \"the United States\" turned
into a **singular noun**]{.underline}. The late historian Shelby Foote
repeated an oft-told tale for the popular documentary series The Civil
War (first broadcast on PBS in 1990): Before the war, it was said \"the
United States are.\" Grammatically, it was spoken that way and thought
of as a collection of independent states. And after the war, it was
always \"the United States is,\" as we say today without being
self-conscious at all. And that sums up what the war accomplished. It
made us an \"is.\" Foote\'s tidy narrative is just a little too tidy,
reiterating conventional wisdom that has been floating around since a
couple of decades after the end of the Civil War. In 1887, a Washington
Post writer declared that the Civil War \"settled forever the question
of grammar\... The surrender of Mr. Davis and Gen. Lee meant a
transition from the plural to the singular.\" Four years later,
clergyman G. H. Emerson wrote that \"the change from the plural to the
singular was vital, though it has taken a War of Rebellion to make the
difference unmistakable.\" And in 1909, classics scholar and former
Confederate soldier Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve stated, in a widely
quoted lecture, \"It was a point of grammatical concord which was at the
bottom of the Civil War --- \'United States are,\' said one, \'United
States is,\' said another.\" Rather than just accepting such sweeping
claims, one writer sought to track the actual shift in usage from \"the
United States are\" to \"the United States is.\" In 1901, former
secretary of state John W. Foster contributed an article to the New York
Times finding that the transformation from plural to singular was a slow
and messy one. In the Constitution, for instance, \"the United States\"
is treated as plural, but so is \"the House of Representatives,\" \"the
Senate,\" and \"Congress.\" Over time, usage changed in American
English, so that these collective nouns became construed as singular.
(In British English, collective nouns can still take plural verb forms.)
\"The United States\" also went the singular route, but its path was
complicated by the plural ending -s at the end of \"States.\" Foster
shoots down the popular notion that the Civil War was wholly responsible
for the change in thinking. Before the war, there were writers and
statesmen who preferred the singular, and afterwards there were still
many who held on to the old plural usage. You can see the persistence of
the traditional plural treatment of \"the United States\" in the 13th
Amendment, ratified at war\'s end in 1865: Neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the
party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United
States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction. In fact, the
\"United States is/are\" debate raged for decades and was hardly settled
by the surrender of the Confederacy. An 1895 column in the Indianapolis
Journal defended the usage of Secretary of State Richard Olney, who
preferred \"the United States are.\" The writer insisted that this was
correct usage on grammatical grounds: \"Thoroughly as one may believe in
the idea of nationality, one cannot ignore the structural principles of
the English language.\" As late as 1909, Ambrose Bierce was clinging to
this grammatical defense of \"the United States\" as plural. In his
peevish compendium Write it Right, Bierce griped, \"Grammar has not a
speaking acquaintance with politics, and patriotic pride is not
schoolmaster to syntax.\" But Bierce was on the losing side of that
argument. [Already, as a result of Secretary Foster\'s careful
historical research on the subject, the House of Representative\'s
Committee on Revision of the Laws had ruled in 1902 that \"the United
States\" should be **treated as singular, not plural**]{.underline}. The
tide had finally turned --- four decades after the Civil War.

[Virgin Islands]{.underline} in the Caribbean Sea. Although they are
governed by the United States, the territories do not have statehood
status, and this lesser legal and political status sets them apart from
the rest of the United States. The three U.S. territories are not the
only U.S. government land holdings without statehood status. These
various lands fall under the broad description of insular political
communities affiliated with the United States. Puerto Rico in the
Caribbean and the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific Ocean belong
to the United States and have the status of commonwealth, a legal and
political status that is above a territory but still below a state. The
United States also has a number of islands in the Pacific Ocean that are
called variously territories and possessions. U.S. possessions have the
lowest legal and political status because these islands do not have
permanent populations and do not seek self-determination and autonomy.
[U.S. possessions include Baker, Howland, Kingman Reef, Jarvis,
Johnston, Midway, Palmyra, and Wake Islands]{.underline}.

# Should

### Should- Obligation

#### Should means an obligation or duty

**AHD 92** -- AHD, American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,
1992 (4ed); Pg. 1612

Should---1. Used to express obligation or duty: *You should send her a
note*.

#### "Should" expresses duty, obligation, or necessity

**Webster's 61** -- Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1961 p.
2104

Used in auxiliary function to express duty, obligation, necessity,
propriety, or expediency

#### Should's main function in American English is to express duty or necessity. Other usages produce ambiguity.

**Random House Kernerman Webster\'s College Dictionary 2010**
https://www.thefreedictionary.com/should

should (ʃʊd)

auxiliary v.

1\. pt. of shall.

2\. (used to indicate duty, propriety, or expediency): You should not do
that.

3\. (used to express condition): Were he to arrive, I should be pleased.

4\. (used to make a statement less direct or blunt): I should think you
would apologize.

\[Middle English sholde, Old English sc(e)olde; see shall\]

usage: Rules similar to those for choosing between shall and will have
long been advanced for should and would, but [most educated native
speakers of American English do not follow the textbooks.]{.underline}
In most constructions, would is the auxiliary chosen regardless of the
subject: If our allies supported the move, we would abandon any claim to
sovereignty. [Because the main function of should in modern American
English is to express duty, necessity, etc., its use for other purposes,
as to form a subjunctive, can produce ambiguity]{.underline}, at least
initially: I should get my flu shot if I were you. Furthermore, should
seems an affectation to many Americans in certain constructions quite
common to British English: I should (American would) really prefer a
different arrangement. See also shall.

### Should -- Mandatory

#### "Should" is mandatory

**Nieto 9** -- Judge Henry Nieto, Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009
People v. Munoz, 240 P.3d 311 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009)

[\"Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [the
weight of authority appears to favor interpreting \"should\" in an
imperative, obligatory sense]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word \"should\" in
jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld
instructions using the word. [In the courts of other states]{.underline}
in which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the
reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that
it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is
submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They
reasoned [that the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and
could not be misunderstood]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v.
McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v.
State, 217 Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995)
(finding argument that \"should\" is directional but not instructional
to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504
A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably, [courts interpreting
the word \"should]{.underline}\" in other types of jury instructions
\[\*\*16[\] have]{.underline} also [found that the word
conveys]{.underline} to the [jury a sense of duty or obligation and not
discretion]{.underline}. In Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554 S.W.2d
312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [the Arkansas Supreme Court interpreted the word
\"should\"]{.underline} in an instruction on circumstantial evidence [as
synonymous with the word \"must**\"**]{.underline} and rejected the
defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by the court\'s
use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, [the Missouri Supreme
Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court erred by not using
the word \"should\" in an instruction]{.underline} on witness
credibility [which used the word \"must\" because the two words have the
same meaning]{.underline}. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215 (Mo.
1958). \[\*318\] In applying a child support statute, [the Arizona
Court]{.underline} of Appeals [concluded that a legislature\'s or
commission\'s use of the word \"should\" is meant to convey duty or
obligation]{.underline}. McNutt v. McNutt, 203 Ariz. 28, 49 P.3d 300,
306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a statute stating that child support
expenditures \"should\" be allocated for the purpose of parents\'
federal tax exemption to be mandatory).

#### "Should" means must -- its mandatory

**Foresi 32** (Remo Foresi v. Hudson Coal Co., Superior Court of
Pennsylvania, 106 Pa. Super. 307; 161 A. 910; 1932 Pa. Super. LEXIS 239,
7-14, Lexis)

[As regards the mandatory character of the rule, the word
\'should\']{.underline} is not only an auxiliary verb, it
[is]{.underline} also [the preterite of the verb, \'shall\' and has for
one of its meanings as]{.underline} defined in the Century Dictionary:
\"[Obliged or compelled (to); would have (to); must; ought (to); used
with an infinitive]{.underline} (without to) [to express obligation,
necessity or duty in connection with some act yet to be carried
out.\"]{.underline} We think it clear that it is in that sense that the
word \'should\' is used in this rule, not merely advisory. When the
judge in charging the jury tells them that, unless they find from all
the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of
the offense charged, they should acquit[, the word \'should\' is **not
used in an advisory sense** but has the force or meaning of \'must\', or
\'ought to\' and carries]{.underline} \[\*\*\*8\] [with it the sense
of]{.underline} \[\*313\] [obligation and duty equivalent to
**compulsion**]{.underline}. A natural sense of sympathy for a few
unfortunate claimants who have been injured while doing something in
direct violation of law must not be so indulged as to fritter away, or
nullify, provisions which have been enacted to safeguard and protect the
welfare of thousands who are engaged in the hazardous occupation of
mining.

Other legislated DA earmarks in the FY2005 appropriations bill are

Fertilizer Development Center (\$2.3 million), and clean water treatment
(\$2 million). Interestingly, in the wording of the bill, Congress uses
the term *shall* in connection with only two of these eight earmarks;
the others say that USAID *should* make the prescribed amount available.
[The difference between shall and should may have legal
significance---one is clearly mandatory while the other is a strong
admonition---but it makes little practical difference]{.underline} in
USAID's need to comply with the congressional directive to the best of

### Should- Not Certain

#### "Should" doesn't require certainty

**Black's Law 79** (Black's Law Dictionary -- Fifth Edition, p. 1237)

[Should]{.underline}. The past tense of shall; ordinarily implying duty
or obligation; although usually no more than an obligation of propriety
or expediency, or a moral obligation, thereby distinguishing it from
"ought." It is not normally synonymous with "may," and although often
interchangeable with the word "would," it [**does not ordinarily express
certainty** as "will" sometimes does. ]{.underline}

#### Should expresses conditionality or contingency

**AHD 92** -- AHD, American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,
1992 (4ed); Pg. 1612

Should---3. Used to express conditionality or contingency: *If she
should fall, then so would* *I*.

### Should -- Desirable

#### "Should" means desirable \-\-- this does not have to be a mandate

**AC 99** (Atlas Collaboration, "Use of Shall, Should, May Can,"
http://rd13doc.cern.ch/Atlas/DaqSoft/sde/inspect/shall.html)

shall [\'shall\' describes something that is mandatory]{.underline}. If
a requirement uses \'shall\', then that requirement \_will\_ be
satisfied without fail. Noncompliance is not allowed. Failure to comply
with one single \'shall\' is sufficient reason to reject the entire
product. Indeed, it must be rejected under these circumstances.
Examples: \# \"Requirements shall make use of the word \'shall\' only
where compliance is mandatory.\" This is a good example. \# \"C++ code
shall have comments every 5th line.\" This is a bad example. Using
\'shall\' here is too strong. should [\'should\' is weaker. It describes
something that might not be satisfied in the final product, but that is
desirable enough]{.underline} that any noncompliance shall be explicitly
justified. Any use of \'should\' should be examined carefully, as it
probably means that something is not being stated clearly. If a
\'should\' can be replaced by a \'shall\', or can be discarded entirely,
so much the better. Examples: \# \"C++ code should be ANSI compliant.\"
A good example. It may not be possible to be ANSI compliant on all
platforms, but we should try. \# \"Code should be tested thoroughly.\"
Bad example. This \'should\' shall be replaced with \'shall\' if this
requirement is to be stated anywhere (to say nothing of defining what
\'thoroughly\' means).

#### Should expresses desirability

(http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=should\*1+0&dict=A)

**[should]{.underline}** (DUTY) auxiliary verb [used to express that it
is]{.underline} necessary, [desirable]{.underline}, advisable, [or

### Should- Expectation

#### Should expresses an expectation of something

**AHD 92** -- AHD, American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,
1992 (4ed); Pg. 1612

Should---2. Used to express probability or expectation: *They should

The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of

it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal
professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the
omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and
the same hereby is\", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an
expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2)
constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the

#### Should refers to what should be NOT what should have been

**OED**, Oxford English Dictionary, **1989** (2ed. XIX), pg. 344

Should An utterance of the word *should*. Also, what 'should be'.

#### Traditional rules regarding use of shall are now archaic. Should means duty or obligation.

**American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 2000**

(4th Edition, p. 1612)

Usage Note [Like the rules governing the use of shall and will on which
they are based, the traditional rules governing the use of should and
would are largely ignored in modern American practice]{.underline}.
[Either should or would can now be used in the first person to express
conditional futurity]{.underline}: If I had known that, I would (or
somewhat more formally, should) have answered differently. But in the
second and third persons only would is used: If he had known that, he
would (not should) have answered differently. Would cannot always be
substituted for should, however. Should is used in all three persons in
a conditional clause: if I (or you or he) should decide to go. [Should
is also used in all three persons to express duty or
obligation]{.underline} (the equivalent of ought to): I (or you or he)
should go. On the other hand, would is used to express volition or
promise: I agreed that I would do it. Either would or should is possible
as an auxiliary with like, be inclined, be glad, prefer, and related
verbs: I would (or should) like to call your attention to an oversight.
Here would was acceptable on all levels to a large majority of the Usage
Panel in an earlier survey and is more common in American usage than
should. Should have is sometimes incorrectly written should of by
writers who have mistaken the source of the spoken contraction
should've.

**Should only means "the past tense of shall" when used as a putative
auxiliary verb. In the context of the resolution, it means "ought to".**

Question The Discrepancies among Shall, Will, Should & Would

[I am always told that \"should\" is the past tense of
\"shall]{.underline}\", just like \"would\" is the past tense of
\"will\". I believe that although the latter may be true, the former can
never be true.

[\"Should\" is a normative term (a suggestion, \"ought
to\").]{.underline}

[A1.]{.underline} [We should abolish this rule (normative
advice).]{.underline}

[A2. We shall abolish this rule (we have decided/are going to, =
\"will\").]{.underline}

[Clearly, A1 is NOT the past tense of A2.]{.underline}

[Thus,]{.underline} [in terms of meaning, \"shall\" and \"will\" should
go together]{.underline} (\"shall\" for the pronouns \"I\" and \"we\",
and \"will\" for others), [and \"should\" should stand alone, or go with
words like, \"ought to\".]{.underline}

Consider the following:

B1. If I stop now, I SHALL fail.

B2. If he stops now, he WILL fail.

B3. If I stopped yesterday, I WOULD fail.

Thus, \"would\" should be the past tense of both \"will\" and \"shall\",
instead of \"should\" being the past tense of \"shall\".

The past tense of \"should\" should be \"should have\":

C1. You should scold him now.

C2. You should have scolded him just now.

Now, [under what case is SHOULD the past tense of SHALL, which most
dictionaries contend?]{.underline}

Source & Date

of Question Singapore

Grammar\'s

Response In \"should have scolded\" you\'re using should as part of an
auxiliary string to create a past tense verb, so that doesn\'t really

[I was extremely upset that he should earn more money than my
brother]{.underline}.

something of real worth and importance; of considerable

something without value or merely nominal

#### Substantial means "of considerable amount" -- not some contrived percentage

**Prost 4** (Judge -- United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, "Committee For Fairly Traded Venezuelan Cement v. United
States", 6-18,
http://www.ll.georgetown.edu/federal/judicial/fed/opinions/04opinions/04-1016.html)

The URAA and the SAA neither amend nor refine the language of
§ 1677(4)(C).  In fact, they merely suggest, without disqualifying other
alternatives, a "clearly higher/substantial proportion" approach. 
Indeed, the SAA specifically mentions that no "precise mathematical
formula" or "'benchmark' proportion" is to be used for a dumping
concentration analysis.  SAA at 860 (citations omitted); see also Venez.
Cement, 279 F. Supp. 2d at 1329-30.  Furthermore, as the Court of
International Trade noted, the SAA emphasizes that the Commission
retains the discretion to determine concentration of imports on a
"case-by-case basis."  SAA at 860.  Finally, [the definition of the word
"substantial" undercuts the]{.underline} CFTVC's [argument.  The word
"substantial" generally means "considerable in amount,]{.underline}
value or worth."  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280
(1993).  [**It does not imply a specific number or cut-off**.  What may
be substantial in one situation may not be in another
situation.]{.underline}  The very breadth of the term "substantial"
undercuts the CFTVC's argument that Congress spoke clearly in
establishing a standard for the Commission's regional antidumping and
countervailing duty analyses.  It therefore supports the conclusion that
the Commission is owed deference in its interpretation of "substantial
proportion."  The Commission clearly embarked on its analysis having
been given considerable leeway to interpret a particularly broad term.

### Substantial -- Considerable

#### \"Substantial\" means considerable in amount or value

Instruction No. 10 was not given in isolation, however. [The district
court\']{.underline}s instructions also contained a definition of
\"substantial.\" Instruction No. 11 [defined \"substantial\" as meaning
\"true, real or likely to materialize\" and as not meaning \"imaginary
or unlikely to materialize.]{.underline}\" This instruction properly
limited the potential bases for the jury\'s decision, which is the
essential function of jury instructions. When combined with the contract
and the verdict-directing instructions, \[\*1432\] which tracked the
operative language of the contract, Instruction No. 11 required the jury
to find that KCPL had determined a real risk, not some imaginary
hypothetical risk premised solely on a reduction in the DRD. Because the
contract provided only one means of creating a risk of making an
indemnity payment\--a demand notice from an Investor\--the jury\'s
discretion was properly channelled into deciding whether KCPL had
sufficiently studied and honestly considered the likelihood of receiving
such a demand notice. That determination is all that the contract
required.

## Substantial -- Quantitative

### Substantially- Quantitative Best

#### The qualitative definitions of substantial are amorphous and unlimiting

**Stark 97** (Stephen J., "Key Words And Tricky Phrases: An Analysis Of
Patent Drafter\'s Attempts To Circumvent The Language Of 35 U.S.C.",
Journal of Intellectual Property Law, Fall, 5 J. Intell. Prop. L. 365,
Lexis)

Ordinary Meaning. First, words in a patent are to be given their
ordinary meaning unless otherwise defined.
[30](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=1421887dc00d6c0b78bddb20857a69fa&docnum=20&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkAz&_md5=3f3ffe65eadff46b38ea49c40cb1037e&focBudTerms=definition%20of%20the%20term%21%20substantial%21%20or%20definition%20of%20the%20word%20substantial%21&focBudSel=all#n30)
However, what if a particular word has multiple meanings? For example,
**[consider the word \"substantial.\"]{.underline}** The Webster
dictionary gives eleven different definitions of the word substantial.
[31](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=1421887dc00d6c0b78bddb20857a69fa&docnum=20&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkAz&_md5=3f3ffe65eadff46b38ea49c40cb1037e&focBudTerms=definition%20of%20the%20term%21%20substantial%21%20or%20definition%20of%20the%20word%20substantial%21&focBudSel=all#n31)
Additionally, there are another two definitions specifically provided
for the adverb \"substantially.\"
[32](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=1421887dc00d6c0b78bddb20857a69fa&docnum=20&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkAz&_md5=3f3ffe65eadff46b38ea49c40cb1037e&focBudTerms=definition%20of%20the%20term%21%20substantial%21%20or%20definition%20of%20the%20word%20substantial%21&focBudSel=all#n32)
Thus, the \"ordinary meaning\" is not clear. The first definition of the
word \"substantial\" given by the Webster\'s Dictionary is \"of ample or
considerable amount, quantity, size, etc.\"
[33](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=1421887dc00d6c0b78bddb20857a69fa&docnum=20&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzW-zSkAz&_md5=3f3ffe65eadff46b38ea49c40cb1037e&focBudTerms=definition%20of%20the%20term%21%20substantial%21%20or%20definition%20of%20the%20word%20substantial%21&focBudSel=all#n33)
Supposing that this is the precise definition that the drafter had in
mind when drafting the patent, **[the meaning of \"ample or considerable
amount\" appears amorphous. This could have one of at least the
following interpretations: (1) almost all, (2) more than half, or (3)
barely enough to do the job. Therefore, the use of a term, such as
\"substantial,\" which usually has a very ambiguous meaning, makes the
scope of protection particularly hard to determine]{.underline}**.

### Substantial Reduction- 50-75%

#### A substantial reduction is 50-75%

Glosbe No Date, "substantial reduction in English",
https://glosbe.com/en/en/substantial%20reduction

For reasons explained at length in the decision, none of the companies
meets the conditions for obtaining immunity from fines, [a \"very
substantial\" reduction of the fine (i.e. at least 75%) or even a
\"substantial\" reduction (i.e. between 50% and 75%).]{.underline}

### [Substantial Reduction -- 75%]{.underline}

#### A substantial reduction is at least 75%

**Montiero, Lawyer who studied at the New York University of Law, 2005**

(Luis G., *Research Paper for the Antitrust and Economics Seminar*, p.
18-19, NS)

By reading the 1996 EC notice one realizes that it suffered the
consequences of establishing a high evidential standard. Section B of
the notice, [under the title]{.underline} "[Non-imposition of a fine or
a very substantial reduction in its amoun]{.underline}t", a corporation
which is the first to adduce "decisive evidence" of a cartel's existence
would benefit from [a reduction of at least 75% of the fine or even from
total exemption of it]{.underline}. However, by choosing this broad
legal concept of "decisive evidence", corporations could not be sure as
to whether they had enough evidence for the Commission, in order to
fulfill the requirement and qualify for a non-imposition of a fine or
get a very substantial reduction in its amount. Experience showed that
the risk of whistleblowing without proper reward was too high. On the
other hand, according to the US CLP, undertakings only had to tell
everything they knew about the cartel to get the benefit of the leniency
policy. This lower level requirement increased the potential pool of the
whistleblowers since even undertakings which did not have access to
highly relevant information could also apply under US CLP.

### Substantial -- 2%

#### "Substantial" must be [at least]{.underline} 2%

**Words & Phrases 60**

### Substantial -- 10%

#### Less than 10% is insubstantial

**Mickels 8** (Alissa, JD Candidate -- Hastings College of Law, "Summary

**[Substantial v. insubstantial:]{.underline}** Modern courts consider
competition with commercial firms as "strong evidence of a substantial
nonexempt purpose." Living Faith, Inc. v. Comm'r, 60 T.C.M. 710, 713
(1990). Although the tax court has held that [the definition of
insubstantial is **fact specific**, it has found that **less than ten
percent** of]{.underline} a charity's total [efforts is
**"insubstantial"**]{.underline}, World Family Corp. v. Comm'r, 78 T.C.
921 (1982), where as unrelated business activity generating one-third of
an organizations revenue does not qualify for tax-exempt status. Orange
County Agric. Soc'y, Inc. v. Comm'r, 55 T.C.M. 1602, 1604 (1988), aff'd
893 F.2d 647 (2d Cir. 1990). However, this may be changing after an
increasing emphasis on commensurate test.

### Substantial- 30%

#### Substantial decrease is at least 30%

**Hantash 06,** Patent Attorneys & Engineers Lynch Kneblewski - Sâo

\[Feras, 3/16,
http://www.freshpatents.com/Method-for-detecting-cystic-fibrosis
dt20060316ptan20060057593.php\]

\[0011\] A substantial increase in the amount of a CFTR target segment
identified means that the segment has been duplicated while a
substantial decrease in the amount of a CFTR target segment identified
means that the target segment has been deleted. [The term \"substantial
decrease\" or \"substantial increase\" means a decrease or increase of
at least about 30-50%.]{.underline} Thus, deletion of a single CFTR exon
would appear in the assay as a signal representing for example of about
50% of the same exon signal from an identically processed sample from an
individual with a wildtype CFTR gene. Conversely, amplification of a
single exon would appear in the assay as a signal representing for
example about 150% of the same exon signal from an identically processed
sample from an individual with a wildtype CFTR gene.

### Substantial -- 33%

#### "Substantially" means 33 percent

**Maples 7** (Larry, "Pitfalls in Preserving Net Operating Losses", The
CPA Journal, 3-1, Lexis)

If a new loss corporation has substantial nonbusiness assets, the value
of the old loss corporation must be reduced by the amount of the
nonbusiness assets less liabilities attributable to those assets.
[\"Substantial\" is defined as one-third of total assets.]{.underline}
This is a difficult provision to interpret. IRC section 382(1)(4)
provides that a value reduction in the old loss corporation is required
if, just after an ownership change, the new loss corporation has
substantial nonbusiness assets. This language seems odd because the
purpose of IRC section 382 is to prevent loss trafficking, so it would
seem that the asset test ought to apply to the old loss corporation.

### Substantial -- 40%

#### "Substantially" means 40% \-\-- strict quantification avoids vagueness

**Schwartz 4** (Arthur, Lawyer -- Schwartz + Goldberg, 2002 U.S. Briefs
1609, Lexis)

In the opinion below, [the Tenth Circuit suggested that a percentage
figure would be **a way to avoid vagueness issues**]{.underline}. (Pet.
App., at 13-14) Indeed, one of the Amici supporting the City in this
case, [the American Planning Association, produced a publication that
actually makes a recommendation of a percentage figure]{.underline} that
should be adopted by municipalities in establishing zoning  \[\*37\] 
regulations for adult businesses. [n8 The APA\'s well researched report
recommended that the terms \"**substantial\" and \"significant\" be
quantified at 40 percent**]{.underline} for floor space or inventory of
a business in the definition of adult business. n9 (Resp. Br. App., at
15-16)

### Substantial -- 50%

#### [Less than]{.underline} 50% is insubstantial

**Brown 94** (Mark R., Professor of Law -- Stetson University College of
Law, "The Demise of Constitutional Prospectivity: New Life for Owen?",
Iowa Law Review, January, 79 Iowa L. Rev. 273, Lexis)

n241 I am assuming here that \"foreseeable\" means \"probable,\" as in
\"more probable than not.\" This appears to be a safe assumption given
the proliferance of cases granting immunity to officials who offend the
Constitution. If this definition is correct, deterrence only works and
liability should only attach if one\'s conduct, viewed ex ante, is more
likely illegal than legal: the risk of illegality must be more than
fifty percent. In other words, one cannot face deterrence, and liability
will not attach, if the risk of illegality is less than fifty percent[.
(When viewed in this fashion, one might perceive a risk]{.underline} of
illegality but still not be deterrable because the risk [is **not
substantial, i.e., not greater than fifty percent**.).]{.underline}
Lawful conduct, of course, need not be probably lawful. That is what
risk is about. Situations might arise where the objective risk is that
conduct is unlawful, but ex post it is lawful. Lest judicial reasoning
be completely askew, a fairly strong correlation exists, however,
between action that is ex ante probably lawful and that which is lawful
ex post in the courts. If this is not true, then courts are reaching
objectively improbable conclusions, and the whole idea of reliance is
illusory.

#### Legal experts agree

**Davignon v. Clemmey 1** (Davignon v. Clemmey, 176 F. Supp. 2d 77,
Lexis)

The court begins the lodestar calculation by looking at the
contemporaneous billing records for each person who worked on the
plaintiff\'s case. [The absence of detailed contemporaneous time
records]{.underline}, except in extraordinary circumstances, [will call
for a substantial reduction in any award]{.underline} or, in egregious
cases, disallowance. **[What is a \"substantial reduction\"? Fifty
percent is a favorite among judges.]{.underline}  **

#### Substantial is 50%- two examples

**Smythe 10**

\"**[Substantial damage]{.underline}**\" **[means damage]{.underline}**
of any origin sustained by a structure **[whereby the cost of restoring
the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50
percent of the market value]{.underline}** of the structure before the
damage occurred. **[\"Substantial improvement\" means any
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new
development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent of the market value of the structure before the \"start of
construction\"]{.underline}** of the improvement. This term includes
structures which have incurred \"substantial damage\", regardless of the
actual repair work performed.

#### Substantial increase or decrease is 50 to 100 percent

**UNEP 2** ( United nations environmental program,

decrease in pressure between 2002 and 2032. \'No change\' means less
than 10 per cent change in pressure over the scenario period; **[small
increase or decrease means between 10 and 50 per cent change;
substantial increase or decrease means 50 to 100 per cent
change;]{.underline}** strong increase means more than doubling of

### Substantial- Must be Given Meaning

#### "Substantial" must be given meaning

**Words and Phrases 60** (Vol. 40, State -- Subway, p. 762)

["Substantial" is a relative word, which, while it must be used with
care and discrimination, **must** nevertheless be **given
effect**]{.underline}, and in a claim of patent allowed considerable
latitude of meaning where it is applied to such subject as thickness, as
by requiring two parts of a device to be substantially the same
thickness, and cannot be held to require them to be of exactly the same
thickness. Todd. V. Sears Roebuck & Co., D.C.N.C., 199 F.Supp. 38, 41.

#### \"Substantial\" must be gauged in context

**Words and Phrases 2** (Volume 40A, p. 464)

Cal. 1956. "[Substantial" is a **relative term**, its measure to be
**gauged by all the circumstances surrounding** the matter in reference
to which the expression has been used]{.underline}

#### Context is key \-\-- \"substantial\" has no exact meaning

**Words and Phrases 2** (Volume 40A, p. 483)

The word "[substantial" is susceptible to different meanings according
to the circumstances, and is variously defined]{.underline} as actual,
essential, material, fundamental, although **[no rule of thumb can be
laid down fixing its exact meaning]{.underline}**

#### \"Substantiality\" should be defined on a case-by-case basis

**Edlin 2** (Aaron, Professor of Economics and Law -- University of
California Berkeley School of Law, January, 111 Yale L.J. 941)

[Might price reductions of less than twenty percent qualify as
substantial? In some markets they should, and it would be **reasonable
to decide substantiality on a case-by-case basis**]{.underline}. One
advantage of a bright-line rule is that it would let incumbents know
where they stand. Monopolies that price only slightly above their
average cost would be insulated from the entry of higher-cost entrants
if they could credibly convey a willingness to price below the
entrants\' cost after entry, as illustrated in Part III. However, these
monopolies do consumers little harm and may enhance market efficiency.

### Substantial -- Vague/Arbitrary

"Substantial" is inherently flexible and imprecise

**Mellinkoff in 92** (David, Law Professor UCLA, 1992 ([Mellinkoff's
Dictionary of American Legal Usage]{.underline}, p. 626).

**[substantial is as flexible in the law as in ordinary
English]{.underline}**. That is its reason for continued existence in
the law. **[Long use of substantial in combinations]{.underline}**,
e.g., *substantial evidence*, **[can produce impression of precision,
which is lacking.]{.underline}** The word is an alert! **[What
substantial fastens itself to becomes infected with substantial's
flexibility. A place for discretion]{.underline}**.

#### Their definition of substantial is arbitrary -- there's no consistency in US Code.

Jeffrey M. **Colon**, Associate Professor of Law, Fordham University
School of Law, Winter **1997**, San Diego Law Review, 34 San Diego L.
Rev. 1, Lexis Academic

n138. I.R.C. 877(e). **[Neither the statute nor the legislative history
indicates how much of a reduction in taxes is necessary in order to
constitute a \"substantial\" reduction. The meaning of \"substantial\"
varies from one Code section to the other]{.underline}**. Compare, e.g.,
I.R.C. 368(a)(1)(C) (West 1988 & Supp. 1996) (acquisition of
\"substantially all\" of acquired company\'s assets for ruling purposes
is 70% of gross assets and 90% of net assets (Rev. Proc. 77-37, 1977-2
C.B. 568)) with I.R.C. 1092 (West 1988 & Supp. 1996) (\"substantial
diminution\" of risk of loss).

#### Substantial(ly) cannot be measured---its too vague

Ken **Adams 18**, Author at Adam's drafting, "Substantial" and
"Substantially",
<http://www.adamsdrafting.com/substantial-and-substantially/>, January
25

Substantial and substantially exhibit the same problem as aggressively,
which I ranted about in this October 2010 AdamsDrafting blog post. [How
big does something have to be before it is substantial or can be said to
do something substantially? More than 50% of its maximum potential
magnitude? More than 70%?]{.underline} 85.42%? I have no idea. So [the
subjectivity inherent in vagueness is compounded by
imprecision]{.underline}. [Maybe substantial and substantially refer
to]{.underline} a magnitude that's close enough to the maximum that [a
reasonable person in the position of whoever has the benefit would be
satisfied]{.underline}. That may be the case, but I'm not aware that
that meaning is sufficiently accepted that you can take it for granted.

### Substantial- Percentages Bad

**Substantial cannot be determined by percentage tests**

**Leo '8** (Kevin Leo\*\* J.D. Candidate, Spring 2008, Hastings College
of the Law. Hastings Business Law Journal Spring, 2008 4 Hastings Bus.

**Substantially does not mean all**

Justice **Berdon**, 8-24-**99**, Supreme Court of Connecticut, 250 Conn.
334; 736 A.2d 824; 1999 Conn. LEXIS 303

In addition, the plain meaning of \"substantially\" does not support the
defendant\'s arguments. [Black\'s Law]{.underline} Dictionary (6th Ed.
1990) [defines \"substantially\" as \"essentially; without material
qualification]{.underline}; in the main . . . in a substantial manner.\"
Likewise, \"substantial\" is defined as, \"of real worth and importance;
of considerable value; valuable. Belonging to substance; actually
existing; real; not seeming or imaginary; not illusive; solid; true;
veritable. . . . [Synonymous with material]{.underline}.\" (Citations
omitted.) Id. [Thus, the requirement of a \"substantial\" association
creates a threshold far below the exclusive or complete
association]{.underline} argued by the defendant.

### Increase is Preexisting

#### Increase must be of something that already exists

**Buckley 6** Jeremiah, Attorney, Amicus Curiae Brief, Safeco Ins. Co.
of America et al v. Charles Burr et al,
<http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/06-84/06-84.mer.ami.mica.pdf>

First, the court said that [the ordinary meaning of the word "increase"
is "to make something greater]{.underline}," [which it believed should
not "be limited to cases in which a company raises the rate that an
individual has previously been charged]{.underline}." 435 F.3d at 1091.
[Yet the definition]{.underline} offered by the Ninth Circuit [compels
the opposite conclusion]{.underline}. [Because "increase" means "to make
something greater," there must necessarily have been an existing
premium]{.underline}, to which Edo's actual premium may be compared, [to
determine whether an "increase" occurred]{.underline}.
[Congress]{.underline} could have provided that "ad-verse action" in the
insurance context means charging an amount greater than the optimal
premium, but instead [chose to define adverse action in terms of an
"increase." That definitional choice must be respected, not
ignored.]{.underline} See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392-93
n.10 (1979) ("\[a\] defin-ition which declares what a term 'means' . . .
excludes any meaning that is not stated"). Next, the Ninth Circuit
reasoned that because the Insurance Prong includes the words "existing
or applied for," Congress intended that an "increase in any charge" for
insurance must "apply to all insurance transactions -- from an initial
policy of insurance to a renewal of a long-held policy." 435 F.3d at
1091. This interpretation reads the words "exist-ing or applied for" in
isolation. Other types of adverse action described in the Insurance
Prong apply only to situations where a consumer had an existing policy
of insurance, such as a "cancellation," "reduction," or "change" in
insurance. Each of these forms of adverse action presupposes an
already-existing policy, and [under usual canons of statutory
construction the term "increase"]{.underline} also [should be construed
to apply to increases of an already-existing policy]{.underline}. See
Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88, 101 (2004) ("a phrase gathers meaning from
the words around it") (citation omitted).

#### "Increase" implies pre-existence

**Brown 3** US Federal Judge -- District Court of Oregon (Elena Mark and
Paul Gustafson, Plaintiffs, v. Valley Insurance Company and Valley
Property and Casualty, Defendants, 7-17, Lexis

FCRA does not define the term \"increase.\" **[The]{.underline}** plain
and **[ordinary meaning of the verb \"to increase\" is to make something
greater]{.underline}** or larger. 4 Merriam-Webster\'s \[\*\*22\]
Collegiate Dictionary 589 (10th ed. 1998). The \"something\" that is
increased in the statute is the \"charge for any insurance.\" The plain
and common meaning of the noun \"charge\" is \"the price demanded for
something.\" Id. at 192. Thus, the statute plainly means an insurer
takes adverse action if the insurer makes greater (i.e., larger) the
price demanded for insurance.

**[An insurer cannot \"make greater\" something that did not exist
previously]{.underline}**. The statutory definition of adverse action,
therefore, clearly anticipates an insurer must have made an initial
charge or demand for payment before the insurer can increase that
charge. In other words, an insurer cannot increase the charge for
insurance unless the insurer previously set and demanded payment of the
premium for that insured\'s insurance \[\*\*23\] coverage at a lower
price.

#### "Increase" means to add to what already exists.

**Corpus Juris Secundum 44**

Corpus Juris Secundum, 1944, vol. 42, p. 546

["Increase]{.underline}" As a Verb. The term [presupposes the existence
in some measure]{.underline}, or to some extent, [of something which may
be enlarged]{.underline}, connotes a change or alteration in the
original, and has been defined as meaning to extend or enlarge in size,
extent, quantity, number, intensity, value, substance, etc.

### Increase Not Preexisting

#### "Increase" doesn't require prior existence

**Reinhardt 5** U.S. Judge for the UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT (Stephen, JASON RAY REYNOLDS; MATTHEW RAUSCH,
Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.;
HARTFORD FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY, Defendants-Appellees., lexis

Specifically, we must decide whether charging a higher price for initial
insurance than the insured would otherwise have been charged because of
information in a consumer credit report constitutes an \"increase in any
charge\" within the meaning of FCRA. First, we examine the definitions
of \"increase\" and \"charge.\" Hartford Fire contends that, limited to
their ordinary definitions, these words apply only when a consumer has
previously been charged for insurance and that charge has thereafter
been increased by the insurer. The phrase, \"has previously been
charged,\" as used by Hartford, refers not only to a rate that the
consumer has previously paid for insurance but also to a rate that the
consumer has previously been quoted, even if that rate was increased
\[\*\*23\] before the consumer made any payment. Reynolds disagrees,
asserting that[**, under**]{.underline} \[\*1091\] **[the ordinary
definition of the term, an increase in a charge also occurs whenever an
insurer charges a higher rate than it would otherwise have charged
because of any factor-]{.underline}**-such as adverse credit
information, age, or driving record 8 [**\--regardless of whether the
customer was previously charged some other rate**.]{.underline}
According to Reynolds, he was charged an increased rate because of his
credit rating when he was compelled to pay a rate higher than the
premium rate because he failed to obtain a high insurance score. Thus,
he argues, the definitions of \"increase\" and \"charge\" encompass the
insurance companies\' practice. Reynolds is correct.

[**"Increase\" means to make something greater**.]{.underline} See,
e.g., OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (2d ed. 1989) (\"The action, process, or
fact of becoming or making greater; augmentation, growth, enlargement,
extension.\"); WEBSTER\'S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN ENGLISH (3d
college ed. 1988) (defining \"increase\" as \"growth, enlargement,
etc\[.\]\"). \"Charge\" means the price demanded for goods or services.
See, e.g., OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY (2d ed. 1989) (\"The price required
or demanded for service rendered, or (less usually) for goods
supplied.\"); WEBSTER\'S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN ENGLISH (3d
college ed. 1988) (\"The cost or price of an article, service, etc.\").
**[Nothing in the definition of t]{.underline}**hese words implies that
the term [\"**increase**]{.underline} in any charge for\" **[should be
limited to cases in which a company raises the rate that an individual
has previously been charged.]{.underline}**

### Its- Possessive

#### "Its" refers to the United States Federal Government and is possessive

**Updegrave 91** (W.C., "Explanation of ZIP Code Address Purpose", 8-19,
<http://www.supremelaw.org/ref/zipcode/updegrav.htm>)

More specifically, looking at the map on page 11 of the National ZIP
Code Directory, e.g. at a local post office, one will see that the first
digit of a ZIP Code defines an area that includes more than one State.
The first sentence of the explanatory paragraph begins: \"A ZIP Code is
a numerical code that identifies areas within the United States and its
territories for purposes of \...\" \[cf. 26 CFR 1.1-1(c)\]. [Note the
**singular possessive** pronoun \"its\", not \"their\", therefore
carrying the implication that it relates to the \"**U**nited
**S**tates\" as a corporation domiciled in the **D**istrict of
**C**olumbia (in the singular sense), not in the sense of being the 50
States of the Union (in the plural sense).]{.underline} The map shows
all the States of the Union, but it also shows D.C., Puerto Rico and the

Its

A. As adj. poss. pron. Of or belonging to it, or that thing (L. ejus);

C1.1.2.2. [Security Assistance]{.underline} Programs. SA [is a group of
programs]{.underline}, authorized under Title 22 authorities, by which
the United States provides defense articles, military education and

The Secretary of Defense identifies security cooperation goals, assesses
the overall effectiveness of security cooperation activities, and
revises goals when required to ensure continued support for US interests
abroad.54 Security cooperation is the means by which DoD encourages and
enables countries and organizations to work with the US to achieve
strategic objectives. [The [myth that only DoD participates in
security]{.mark} [cooperation]{.mark} activities could not be farther
from the truth]{.underline}. A good working definition of security
cooperation is provided by Colonel Albert Zaccor:55 [Security
cooperation [refers to all USG]{.mark} [assistance provided to
foreign]{.mark} law enforcement, [security]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} defense
[establishments]{.mark} in support of national defense, security, and

differences being that we use the term "U.S. government" rather than
"Department of Defense" and replace "strategic" with "security sector."5
[SC thus covers a broad range of DoD, Department of State (DoS), and
other activities from individual interactions, to unit exercises, to
large train and equip programs.]{.underline}

#### Security cooperation refers to all US assistance to foreign law enforcement, security, and defense establishments

It is an oft-repeated mantra that in order to defeat transnational
terrorism, and by extension other related non-state threats, [the United
States must apply all the elements of national power, including
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.]{.underline}34 The
OSD SCG directs that DOD Security Cooperation "will be integrated with
other elements of national power...in order to achieve national
security, defense, and foreign policy objectives."35 This formulation,
while helpful, obscures two key facts. First, Security Cooperation
includes activities that by their very nature involve the simultaneous
application of more than one element of national power. Security
Cooperation at a minimum requires the combination of diplomatic
relations, military assistance, military-to-military contacts, and
public diplomacy. In other words, Security Cooperation is itself an
application of at least three of the classic elements of national
power.36 Second, [DOD is not the only entity in the USG that interacts
with foreign governments to achieve the stated objectives:
relationships, capabilities, information and intelligence, and access.
The Department of State, the Intelligence Community, and to a lesser
extent, other departments and agencies, conduct activities aimed at the
accomplishment of these objectives, broadly understood]{.underline}.
There is, however, no common USG, or interagency, definition or concept
of Security Cooperation.37 We will return to this issue in the final
section of this paper. For the purposes of the present discussion, this
paper offers the following working definition of Security Cooperation:
**[[Security Cooperation refers to all USG assistance provided to
foreign law enforcement, security, and defense establishments in support
of national defense, security, and foreign policy
objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}**.38 This expanded definition of
Security Cooperation will help us to see how the USG may leverage its
programs and activities to fight terrorism and related non-state
threats.

### Security Cooperation vs. Assistance

#### Security cooperation is undertaken by a different agency than Security Assistance, they are not the same

teams and develops military assistance policy and [manages security
assistance funding through three programs]{.mark}: [Foreign Military

Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, [[security
assistance and security cooperation are not the same
thing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Typically, [[security cooperation refers
to]{.mark} all DOD [interactions with foreign]{.mark} defense
[establishments]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as the Afghanistan Ministry
of Defense) [aimed at building relationships [to promote U.S.
interests]{.mark}, develop partner capacity, and increase U.S. ties to
its allies]{.underline}.5 Generally speaking, DOD considers all
activities listed [under]{.underline} [Title 10]{.underline} of the U.S.
Code to be security cooperation. The Congressional Research Service
estimates that DOD has more than 80 authorities to engage in security
cooperation.6

[[Security assistance refers to a specific set of
programs]{.underline}]{.mark}, some of which are appropriated to DOD,
some to DOS, and both play roles administering:7 such as the following8
: • Through the [International Military Education and Training
program]{.underline} (IMET), DOD provides professional education to
foreign officials (typically military, but sometimes other security
officials). • Because [peacekeeping operations]{.underline} (PKO) are
provided as voluntary support for peacekeeping activities, they are
considered as separate and distinct from regular U.S. contributions to
the United Nations. Funds for PKO are used for security, though not
necessarily for military purposes. For example, DOS has deployed police
advisors to the UN Mission in South Sudan to support training and
advisory operations. • DOS uses [International Narcotics and Law
Enforcement Control]{.underline} (INCLE) to build the capacity of
foreign law enforcement organizations. • [The 1206 Global Train and
Equip fund]{.underline} is a relatively new account, established in the
aftermath of the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to build partner
capacity for time sensitive "new and emerging" counterterrorist
operations or to enable partners to support military and stability
operations in which U.S. armed forces are a participant. [• Special
military authorities include the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund
(ASFF), Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF), Pakistan Counterinsurgency
Capability Fund]{.underline} (PCCF), and [other country-specific train
and equip authorities]{.underline}. These funds convey broad powers to
DOD to build the capacity of nonmilitary security entities such as the
Afghanistan Ministry of Interior, which includes the Afghanistan
National Police

"Military assistance," "[security assistance," "security

connection with the supply of weapons, equipment, supplies, and training
to such forces and, in some cases, engagement with them]{.underline}.
Some of these terms are defined by policy documents or in law (see
Appendix A). Some authorities are labeled with two more informal
terms---"build partner capacity" or "train and equip"---which are used
in the discussion of specific authorities below.7 Terminology [The [two
terms]{.mark} [most commonly used]{.mark} today for assistance to
foreign military and security forces [are "security assistance" and
"security cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline}" [Security assistance is the
term most frequently used]{.underline}, [regardless of the agency
providing that assistance]{.underline}. [There is [no State Department
definition for security assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}. The annual
State Department congressional budget justification (CBJ), however,
lists six budget accounts under the heading "International Security
Assistance." These accounts, with their underlying Title 22 authorities
(the 1961 FAA and the AECA), are commonly regarded as the State
Department's security assistance portfolio.

**DoD Title 10 projects are referred to as both security assistance and
cooperation.**

[For most of the past half-century, [Congress has authorized]{.mark}
U.S. **[security assistance]{.mark}** programs [through]{.mark} Title 22
of the U.S. Code (Foreign Relations) and appropriated the bulk of
security assistance funds through **[State Department]{.mark}**
accounts]{.underline}. DOD administers programs funded through several
of these accounts under the Secretary of State's direction and
oversight. Beginning in the 1980s, [however]{.mark}, and increasingly
after the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001
(9/11), some policymakers have come to view the State Department
authorities, or the funding allocated to them, as insufficient and too
inflexible to respond to evolving and emerging security threats. [As a
result, [Congress has **increasingly provided DOD** **with the
means**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} offer [security assistance]{.mark} under
authorities [in]{.mark} either [Title 10]{.mark} of the U.S. Code (Armed
Services) [or]{.mark} the annual [National Defense Authorization
Act]{.mark} (NDAA), both funded as part of the DOD budget]{.underline}.
(These are collectively known as "Title 10" authorities and referred to
by DOD as "security cooperation.")  [[DOD security assistance and other
security cooperation programs conducted under Title 10 authority and
established prior to 9/11 include counternarcotics,
counter-proliferation, humanitarian assistance, and assistance for
training and equipping NATO forces]{.mark}. Title 10 statutes also
provide authority for DOD to pay the expenses of foreign forces to
enable them to participate in exercises, exchanges, and other
military-to-military contacts.  Post-9/11 DOD security cooperation
authorities focus on counterterrorism assistance, and assistance to
foreign forces in areas of conflict. Much of this assistance is for
"building partner capacity" (BPC) to enable foreign forces to take
greater responsibility for their own defense and for achieving mutual
security goals in order to reduce U.S. costs.]{.underline} As part of
the BPC effort, recent legislation provides DOD with authority to help
strengthen foreign Ministries of Defense and related defense
institutions. (Some of these DOD authorities require the concurrence
\[i.e., approval\] of the Secretary of State.)  Post-9/11 innovations
include Congress's establishment through NDAA authority of two joint
State Department-DOD authorities with a lead role for the Secretary of
State: (1) an Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund established in FY2011 and
(2) the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF), a pilot project
established in FY2012 to address emerging threats. In FY2006, Congress
created a DOD "joint formulation" BPC authority to address emerging
counterterrorism threats, with DOD in the lead.

### Security vs. Resilience

Scan these two lists, and you come to an inescapable conclusion:
[Security and resilience are not synonyms or even second
cousins]{.underline}. In fact, [security and resilience have remarkably
little to do with one another]{.underline}. [The measures under the
"security" list are about locking up. Those under "resilience" are about
standing up. Security is about hunkering down. Resilience is about doing
business]{.underline}.

### NATO = 30 Allies, Cyber Defense Contextual

#### NATO is the 30 allies

**NATO 5/10/22** ("10 things you need to know about NATO,"
<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/126169.htm>, GAL)

10 things you need to know about NATO

1\. Collective defence: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([NATO)
was founded in 1949 and is a group of 30 countries from Europe and North
America that exists to protect the people and territory of its
members]{.underline}. [The Alliance is founded on the principle of
collective defence, meaning that if one NATO Ally is attacked, then all
NATO Allies are attacked]{.underline}. For example, when terrorists
attacked the United States on 9/11 2001, all NATO Allies stood with
America as though they had also been attacked.

Since 2014, NATO has implemented the biggest increase in its collective
defence since the Cold War. For instance, we have now deployed four
multinational battlegroups to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
Their purpose is not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent one.

2\. Managing crises around the world: Promoting stability in our
neighbourhood and protecting our people at home can sometimes mean
taking action further afield. In the 1990s, NATO stopped further
bloodshed from occurring in Bosnia and Kosovo. Since 2003, NATO has
helped to ensure that Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for
international terrorist groups. NATO has also helped to prevent piracy
off the Horn of Africa and, since 2016, has helped address the refugee
and migrant crisis in Europe.

3\. Fighting Terrorism: NATO plays an important role in fighting
terrorism, contributing more than 13,000 NATO troops to train local
forces in Afghanistan. NATO is also a full member of the Global
Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and our AWACS surveillance aircraft continue
to support the Coalition. NATO is also training Iraqi forces to better
fight ISIS, and our new Intelligence Division helps us to anticipate and
respond to threats. In Naples, NATO has set up a 'Hub for the South' to
help Allies tackle the threat of terrorism.

4\. Working with our partners: Because threats like terrorism, piracy
and cyber warfare know no borders, NATO is committed to cooperation with
its global partners. That\'s why we work with over 40 partner countries
around the world, as well as organisations such as the United Nations,
the European Union, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) and the African Union, to spread stability and security.

5\. Troops and Equipment: Whenever NATO carries out a mission,
individual Allies commit troops and equipment to be placed under a
unified NATO command. These become known as "NATO forces." The only
military equipment that NATO owns is a fleet of AWACS (Airborne Warning
and Control) surveillance aircraft. NATO is also developing a capability
for Global Hawk surveillance drones.

6\. NATO\'s Command Structure: With so many countries working together,
having a clear chain of command is vital. Military and civilian
personnel from all member states work together every day within NATO's
'Command Structure.' This includes two top-level Strategic Commands:
Allied Command Operations, based in Mons, Belgium; and Allied Command
Transformation, based in Norfolk in the United States. To remain fit for
purpose, the NATO Command Structure is being modernised to enable us to
move forces more quickly across Europe and to keep sea lines of
communication across the Atlantic free and open.

7\. NATO funding: Every NATO country contributes to the costs of running
the Alliance. By far the Allies\' biggest contribution comes in the form
of taking part in NATO-led missions and operations. For example, one
country might provide fighter jets, while another provides ships,
equipment or troops. NATO Allies also provide direct funding to NATO to
cover the costs of NATO staff and facilities, its Command Structure and
its jointly-owned equipment, like its AWACS aircraft.

8\. Defence Spending: At the Wales Summit in 2014, NATO Allies pledged
to invest more and better in defence -- to stop the cuts, move towards
spending 2% of GDP on defence by 2024, and to spend 20% of that on major
equipment. We are making progress. Over the last three years, European
Allies and Canada have spent almost 46 billion US dollars more on
defence.

9\. The \"Open Door\" Policy: The Open Door Policy is a founding
principle of NATO and means that any country in the Euro-Atlantic area
is free to join NATO if it is prepared to meet the standards and
obligations of membership, contributes to the security of the Alliance,
and shares NATO\'s values of democracy, reform, and the rule of law.
Since 1949, NATO\'s membership has grown from 12 to 30 countries. In
2020 we welcomed North Macedonia as our 30th member of the NATO
Alliance.

10\. [Cyber Defence]{.underline}: Cyber-attacks are becoming more
common, sophisticated and damaging, making cyber defence a top priority
for NATO. In fact, NATO now recognises cyberspace as an 'operational
domain' -- just as land, sea or air. [NATO helps Allies to boost their
cyber defences by sharing information about threats, investing in
education and training, and through exercises. NATO also has cyber
defence experts that can be sent to help Allies under
attack.]{.underline}

Sweden wrote that its "close relationship with the United States is of
central importance for Sweden\'s security and prosperity," adding that
the relationship "also applies to the Arctic region." In [2009

Finland stated an interest in "intensified" relations with the United
States, including in security matters, but didn\'t prominently link
relations to reaching any end-states. Most recently, Finland was
emphatic in connecting increased relations with the United States to
maintaining Finland\'s security, writing in [2020

"the U.S. commitment to the European defense is of great importance for
the security of the whole of Europe." Again, this is a clear change from
downplaying security relations---[which often

criticality of the United States in the region for Norway, Sweden, and
Finland.

Kadhimi, however, clarified that [Iraq seeks increasing cooperation with
NATO countries]{.underline} in terms of sustainable training and working
continuously [to raise the readiness of the Iraqi military and security
capabilities]{.underline}.

"We look forward to continuing [NATO's
training](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/02/nato-iraq-expand-mission-isis.html) of
Iraqi forces, rehabilitating and equipping our armed forces, supporting
military colleges, expanding police training programs and [training the
forces](https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2020/01/iran-iraq-us-troops-nato.html) on
specialized skills and technicians in air and naval weapons to enable
them to confront terrorism," he said.

[Iraq considers the evolution of security cooperation with NATO through
a reduction of combat forces, but with an increase in training and
logistic support]{.underline}, in order to obtain the necessary
expertise of its military institutions to help raise the level of their
professionalism and efficiency, and provide them with sufficient
equipment.

Kadhimi requested NATO countries provide Iraqi military institutions
with modern and advanced military equipment, hoping Iraq to strengthen
efforts to reform its security system in order to maintain Iraq\'s
security and stability.

### Aff- Partners Key to NATO Core Tasks

https://www.nato.int/nato_static/assets/pdf/pdf_2013_12/20131127_131201-MediaBackgrounder-Partnerships_en.pdf

Media Backgrounder December 2013

[NATO's Strategic Concept identifies "cooperative security" as one of
NATO's three essential core tasks]{.underline}. It states that [the
promotion of Euro-Atlantic security is best assured through a wide
network of partner relationships]{.underline} with countries and
organisations around the globe. [These partnerships make a concrete and
valued contribution to the success of NATO's fundamental
task]{.underline}s. Over the past two decades, the Alliance has
developed a network of structured partnerships with countries from the
Euro-Atlantic area, the Mediterranean and the Gulf region, as well as
individual relationships with other partners across the globe. Today,
[NATO engages with 41 countries as partners]{.underline}. [Many of these
partners as well as other non-member countries offer substantial
capabilities and political support for Alliance missions]{.underline}.
In December 2012, 24 non-NATO countries were contributing over 7000
troops to NATO-led operations. [NATO also engages actively with other
international actors and organisations on defence and security-related
issues, and is seeking to deepen this cooperation]{.underline}. [The
complexity of]{.underline} today's peace-support and stabilization
operations and the multifaceted nature of [21st century security
challenges call for a comprehensive approach that effectively combines
political, civilian and military instruments.]{.underline} A network of
partnerships with non-member countries NATO pursues dialogue and
practical cooperation with non-member countries on a wide range of
political and security-related issues. [Dialogue and cooperation with
partners can make a concrete contribution to enhancing international
security, to defending the values on which the Alliance is based, to
NATO's operations]{.underline}, and to preparing interested nations for
membership. In both regional frameworks and on a bilateral level, NATO
develops relations based on common values, reciprocity, mutual benefit
and mutual respect. In the Euro-Atlantic area, the 28 Allies engage in
relations with 22 partner countries through the Euro-Atlantic
Partnership Council and the Partnership for Peace (PfP) -- a major
programme of bilateral cooperation with individual Euro-Atlantic
partners. Among these partners, NATO has developed specific structures
for its relationships with Russia, Ukraine and Georgia. NATO is
developing relations with the seven countries on the southern
Mediterranean-rim through the Mediterranean Dialogue, as well as with
four countries from the Gulf region through the Istanbul Cooperation
Initiative. NATO also cooperates with a range of countries which are not
part of these partnership frameworks. Referred to as "partners across
the globe," they include Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New
Zealand, Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan and Mongolia.

**NATO, Aug 25, 21**

("Partnerships: projecting stability through
cooperation,"<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_84336.htm> GAL)

[The Allies seek to contribute to]{.underline} the efforts of the
international community in projecting stability and [strengthening
security outside NATO territory. One of the means to do so is through
cooperation and partnerships]{.underline}. Over more than 25 years[, the
Alliance has developed a network of partnerships with non-member
countries]{.underline} from the Euro-Atlantic area, the Mediterranean
and the Gulf region, and other partners across the globe. [NATO pursues
dialogue and practical cooperation with these nations on a wide range of
political and security-related issues. NATO's partnerships are
beneficial to all involved and contribute to improved
security]{.underline} for the broader international community.

[Partners are part of many of NATO's core activities]{.underline}, from
shaping policy to building defence capacity, developing interoperability
and managing crises.

NATO's programmes also help partner nations to develop their own defence
and security institutions and forces. 

In partnering with NATO, partners can:

share insights on areas of common interest or concern through political
consultations and intelligence-sharing;

gain access to advice and support as they reform and strengthen defence
institutions and capacities;

participate in a rich menu of education, training and consultation
events (over 1,200 events a year are open to partners through a
Partnership Cooperation Menu);

prepare together for future operations and missions by participating in
exercises and training;

contribute to current NATO-led operations and missions;

share lessons learned from past operations and develop policy for the
future;

work together with Allies on research and capability development.

Through partnership, NATO and partners also pursue a broad vision of
security:

integrating gender perspectives into security and defence;

fighting against corruption in the defence sector;

enhancing efforts to control or destroy arms, ammunition and unexploded
ordnance;

advancing joint scientific projects.

[Partnership has evolved over the years, to encompass more nations, more
flexible instruments, and new forms of cooperation and
consultation]{.underline}.

We do not find any ambiguity in KRS 341.070(1). It is our opinion that
[the key word in the statute is the word \'in,\' preceding the words
\'each of three calendar quarters\',]{.underline} and if the word is
accorded its ordinary and common meaning, [the statute does not require
simultaneous employment. According to Webster\'s]{.underline} New
International [Dictionary, the word \'in,\' used with relation to a
period of time, means \'during the course of.\']{.underline} The same
meaning, expressed in another way, would be [\'within the limits or
duration of.\']{.underline} Employing this meaning, the statute says
that an employer is subject to the Act if, during the course of, or
within the limits or duration of each of three calendar quarters, he had
in covered employment four or more workers, to each of whom the required
amount of wages was paid. This clearly means that the employment need
not be simultaneous. [**[Obviously, the word \'in\' does not mean
\'throughout\']{.mark}** or \'for the entire period of,\' because then
there would be no point in adding the requirement of the payment of a
minimum of \$50 in wages.]{.underline} In these times, no worker
employed for a full calendar quarter would be paid less than \$50 in
wages. The appellant seeks to read into the statute the words \'at the
same time,\' following the words \'had in covered employment\'. There is
no justification for this, unless the word \'in\' means \'during any one
period of time in.\' [We are not aware of **any authority** for
ascribing such a meaning to the word \'in\']{.underline}.

V. Indicating the agent or doer.

14\. Introducing the agent after a passive verb.

The usual word for this is now by (by prep. 33), which was prevalent by
the 15th cent.; of was used alongside by until c1600. Of is subsequently
found as a stylistic archaism in biblical, poetic, and literary use, and
in certain constructions, e.g. 'on the part of'. In Old English of was
less used than from (both of which, however, retain connotations of
separation or origin): cf. German von from, of.

The use of of is most frequent after past participles expressing a
continued non-physical action (as in admired, loved, hated, ordained
of), or a condition resulting from a definite action (as in abandoned,
deserted, forgotten, forsaken of, which approach branch II.). It is also
occasional with participial adjectives in un-, as unseen of, unowned of.
Of often shows an approach to the subjective genitive: cf. 'he was
chosen of God to this work' with 'he was the chosen of the electors'. In
other senses the agent has passed into the cause, as in afeard, afraid,
frightened, terrified of; or the source or origin, as in born of.
English of and by correspond somewhat to French de and par.

eOE---2001(Show quotations)

15\. Following a noun, as the head of a postmodifying noun phrase.

Sometimes called the subjective genitive. This can often also be
expressed by the possessive case, e.g. 'the approbation of his prince'
or 'his prince\'s approbation', 'the sonatas of Beethoven' or
'Beethoven\'s sonatas'. With sense 15b a combination of the possessive
with the partitive of (sense 32) is also possible, e.g. 'a sonata of
Beethoven\'s'.

Often passing into grammatical apposition, e.g. 'the River Thames',
formerly 'the River of Thames'; the city of Rome, Old English Rōmeburg:
cf. Latin urbs Roma, urbs Buthroti.

†a. In the person of; in respect of being; to be; for. Obs.

The leading noun is the former, of the qualification of which the phrase
introduced by of constitutes a limitation; thus 'he was the greatest
traveller of a prince', i.e. the greatest traveller in the person of a
prince, or so far as princes are concerned. The sense often merges with
that of the partitive genitive. See sense 30.

b\. In the form of, in the guise of.

The leading noun is the latter, to which the preceding noun with of

32\. Followed by a noun in the genitive case or a possessive pronoun.

Originally partitive, but subsequently used instead of the simple
possessive (of the possessor or author) where this would be awkward or
ambiguous, or as equivalent to an appositive phrase; e.g. this son of
mine = this my son; a dog of John\'s = a dog which is John\'s, a dog
belonging to John. The early examples are capable of explanation as
partitive, but in later use this is often not possible, and the
construction may now be viewed as appositional (see further O. Jespersen
On Some Disputed Points in English Grammar (S.P.E. Tract No. XXV,
1926)).

a1225---1991(Show quotations)

X. Expressing possession and being possessed.

E.g. 'the owner of the house', 'the house of the owner'. Generally
regarded as one of the central uses of the word. Formerly expressed by
the genitive case, and still to some extent by the genitive of nouns
(especially proper names) and possessive adjectives (with transposition
of order). The use of of began in Old English with senses 33, 34,
expressing origin. After the Norman Conquest the example of the French
de, which had taken the place of the Latin genitive, caused the gradual
extension of of to all uses in which Old English had the genitive; the
purely possessive sense was the last to be so affected, and it is that
in which the genitive or 'possessive' case is still chiefly used. Thus,
we say the King\'s English, in preference to the English of the King;
but the King of England in preference to England\'s King, which is not
natural or ordinary prose English.

a\. Belonging to a place, as a native or resident.

This occurs in Old English with the sense of origin = 'springing or
coming from, belonging by origin to' (originally sense 10); in the 11th
cent. this passed into the sense 'belonging to as inhabitants or
occupants', 'living in', and so of things 'situated in or at'.

Probably also from the notion of origin. Rare in Old English till 11th

object being found in apposition to a genitive case.

eOE---1995(Show quotations)

b\. Related to a thing or person as its ruler, superior, possessor, etc.

a\. Belonging to a person or thing, as something that he, she, or it has

English preferably expressed by the genitive case (or a possessive
adjective), except when for some reason this is difficult or awkward,
e.g. in quots. c13852, a1616, 1895.

XI\. Representing an original genitive dependent on a verb or adjective.

Many adjectives and verbs in Old English were followed by a genitive
case as an object or complement. In Latin, also, many adjectives and
some verbs were construed with a genitive, represented in French by de.
These are represented in Middle and Modern English by constructions with
of. Those which are closely allied in sense to one or other of the
preceding branches are there included; but there are many other
adjectives and verbs after which of is used to embody a relatively
indefinable syntactic relationship, or which do not clearly fit into any
of these branches. Many of these come close in sense to branch VIII.,
while others, esp. the adjectives, often approach or coincide with the
objective genitive in branch XII. It is convenient therefore to consider
them here.

38\. In the construction of adjectives. Besides those mentioned under
the preceding divisions, many adjectives are construed with of and an
object; the following are representatives of some of the chief groups:
fruitful, prolific, ominous, redolent; liberal, lavish, prodigal, scant,
short, sparing; capable, incapable, susceptible; worthy, unworthy,
guilty, guiltless, innocent; certain, uncertain, confident, diffident,
doubtful, sure; aware, conscious, unconscious, ignorant, sensible,
insensible; careful, careless, forgetful, heedful, heedless, hopeful,
hopeless, mindful, unmindful, reckless, regardless, thoughtless,
neglectful, negligent, observant, watchful; ambitious, desirous, eager,
emulous, enamoured, envious, fond, greedy, jealous, studious,
suspicious; disdainful, indulgent, patient, impatient; those in -ive, as
apprehensive, communicative, descriptive, destructive, expressive,
indicative, productive; and some in -ic, as characteristic, symbolic.

Many of these involve an underlying noun, which may be considered as the
head of the prepositional phrase expressing the genitive relation; e.g.
hopeful of, having hope of, envious of, having envy of, etc.; others are
verbal derivatives, and are closely akin to the objective-genitive group
(see branch XII.), e.g. expressive of = that expresses.

lOE---2001(Show quotations)

39\. In the construction of verbs.

a\. After transitive verbs, the person or thing affected ('secondary
object') is often introduced by of (representing an original genitive).
Such are balk, cheat, defraud, disappoint, frustrate; accuse, arrest,
blame, convict, indict, suspect; possess, seize (a person of); avail,
bethink (oneself of); also with verbs with non-referential it as
subject, as it repents me of; and formerly with ask, beg, beseech, thank
(a person of), etc.

?c1200---1992(Show quotations)

b\. In many verbal phrases, as to have (also get) the advantage of; to
get (also have) the better of; also formerly in to have compassion (also
mercy) of; to have (also take) pity of; to keep watch of, demand or do
justice of (= on), have the victory of (= over).

a1225---1994(Show quotations)

c\. After intransitive verbs. Many of these in Old English took the
genitive, and are found with of in Middle and Early Modern English, but
this is now rare, except where of falls in sense under one of the
branches already treated; instances are to reck, repent, rue, beware
(orig. be ware) of. Verbs of sense, e.g. feel, smell, taste, touch
(still with of in regional or colloquial use), verbs of asking, as ask,
beseech, demand, desire, entreat, and others, e.g. distinguish, esteem,
forget, like, seize, formerly construed with of, now take a simple
object; some, as accept, admit, allow, approve, conceive, recollect,
remember, still have both constructions; with others, as hope, look,
thirst, wait, etc., of has been displaced by for or some other
preposition.

a\. Following an adjective. Now arch., literary, and regional (chiefly
Irish English).

In Old English expressed by on; in French by de; in Latin by the
ablative, genitive, and accusative (of respect).

The of-clause is grammatically an adverbial qualification of the
adjective, for which an adverb may often be substituted, e.g. weak of
mind, 'mentally weak'. Taken together, the adjective + the of-clause = a
compound (parasynthetic) adjective, e.g. light of foot, 'light-footed',
strong of limb, 'strong-limbed'. It is further equivalent to the
of-clause of quality in branch X., e.g. 'a man weak of mind' = 'a man of
weak mind'; the latter being the ordinary prose form.

The quality is usually expressed by a noun qualified by an adjective,
but may consist of a noun alone, as in 'a man of tact', 'a text-book of

= a tactful man, 'a work of authority' = an authoritative work.

Abstract. **[[Biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}** [[can be
defined]{.underline} [as]{.underline} [any
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[that involves living
organisms]{.underline} [or their derivatives]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
applying this definition to rotifers, we focus on their contribution in
culturing of early larval stages of marine fish. After almost four
decades of marine fish culture in captivity, the success of this
worldwide industry is still quite dependent on mass culture of the
species Brachionus plicatilis and B. rotundiformis. In mass culture, the
rotifers are continuously driven to reproduce at high rates, in
relatively extreme environmental conditions of high population density
and high loads of organic matter. Therefore, the success of mass
cultures and future improvements in these systems relies on a close
interaction between basic and applied studies of rotifers. In the
present review, we will attempt to analyze why rotifers are suitable for
early life stages of fish and to describe, in general, methodologies
that have been devised for reliable supply of rotifers in large
quantities. Problems associated with rotifer production, nutritional
quality and effect on fish health and nutrition, will be discussed.
Research on B. plicatilis and B. rotundiformis has increased enormously
during the past three decades and these two species are the best-studied
rotifers so far. While much of the research on these species is directed
or devoted to the needs of aquaculture industry, they are also used as
models for addressing basic biological questions, due to the relative
ease of culture and their availability. Studies on feeding, pheromones,
speciation in rotifers, the occurrence and putative hormones involved in
sexual and asexual reproduction and production of resting eggs, are few
examples of such studies. Rotifers will probably maintain their role as
food organism for fish larvae, in spite of attempts to replace them with
more accessible formulated food. Development of new culture methods that
will improve the nutritional quality and production efficiency of
rotifers may result in more diversified and flexible tasks for these
organisms in aquaculture.

human **[environment]{.mark}** typically by using the techniques of
**gene splicing** and recombinant **DNA** technology. As biotechnology
has evolved from a basic research endeavor towards practical and
commercial applications, protecting inventions by the way of patents has
become increasingly important. The primary recipients of biotechnology
patents are universities, followed by public companies, non-profit
institutions and small and large corporations, both US and
foreign-based.]{.underline}

microbiology, medicine, agriculture etc.

# Cybersecurity

### General

#### Cybersecurity consists of precautions taken to guard against a crime involving the internet.

**Dictionary.com, 21** (Dictionary Dictionary.com, 1-20-2021, accessed
on 7-2-2022, www.dictionary.com, \"Definition of biotechnology \|

[precautions taken to guard against crime that involves the internet,
especially unauthorized access to computer systems and data connected to
the internet. the state of being protected against such
crime.]{.underline}

#### Cybersecurity refers to the protection of information networks

**Borges 20** [(Wanda Borges; experience law attorney, and member at
Borges & Associates, LLC, "*Business Related Fraud and Cyber Security
Awareness"*

Accessed 7/3/22, TR*)*]{.underline}

[[Cyber]{.mark}security [refers to]{.mark} the body of technologies,
processes, and [practices designed to protect networks,]{.mark} devices,
programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized
access.]{.underline} [Cybersecurity may also be referred to [as
information]{.mark} technology [security]{.mark}.]{.underline} Studies
have shown that the highest vulnerabilities lie in small and mid-sized
businesses. These businesses may be more informal in nature, with few
staff members and a lack of checks and balances. However, large
companies are not invulnerable.

#### Cybersecurity is about the integrity of the system

**Kosseff 17** [(Jeff Kosseff; cybersecurity law professor at the United
States Naval Academy, "*New York\'s Financial Cybersecurity Regulation:
Tough, Fair, and a National Mode*"
\[https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&handle=hein.journals/gtltr1&id=366&size=2&collection=usjournals&terms=cybersecurity%20refers%20to&termtype=phrase&set_as_cursor=2\]
Accessed 7/3/22, TR)]{.underline}

The two are similar, but distinct, and can implicate different concerns.
Data security refers to the protection of information stored by a
system; [[cyber]{.mark}security [refers to]{.mark} [the integrity of
a]{.mark} technological [system]{.mark}]{.underline}. A compromise to
the system could mean that an adversary has accessed private information
stored by it, or it could mean the system has been rendered unusable. If
Wall Street firms were focused only on securing the data, then they
might not devote sufficient focus to detecting and repelling a threat to
the cybersecurity of their entire system and networks. A massive denial
of service attack could hobble Wall Street by making it impossible for
securities to be traded for weeks, and the result would be an economic
catastrophe.

#### Cybersecurity refers to the defense against attacks on information infrastructure.

[[Cyber]{.mark}security [refers to the defense against attacks
on]{.mark} the [information]{.mark} technology [infrastructure]{.mark}
of an organization or, in this case, of the federal government and
agencies.]{.underline} Cybersecurity is [intertwined with the physical
security of assets-from computers, networks, and their infrastructure to
the environment surrounding these systems]{.underline}. While both parts
of security are necessary to achieve overall security, this report
[focuses on protecting software and data from attacks that are
electronic in nature]{.underline} and that typically arrive over a data
communication link. Cybersecurity is a major concern of both the federal
government and the private sector.

#### Cybersecurity refers to internet security

[The technical definition of [cyber]{.mark}security [refers to]{.mark}
the Internet [security]{.mark} as a branch of computer security
[specifically related to Internet]{.mark}. Its objective is to establish
rules and measures to use against attacks over Internet.]{.underline}
The advantages of cybersecurity will defend us from critical attacks and
help us to browse the safe websites. Internet security processes all the
incoming and outgoing data on our computer. The term \"cybersecurity\"
commonly refers to the safeguards and actions that can be used to
protect the cyber domain, both in the civilian and military fields, from
those threats that are associated with or that may harm its
interdependent networks and information infrastructure. Cybersecurity
strives to preserve the availability and integrity of the networks and
infrastructure and the confidentiality of the information contained
therein. See the 2013 European Union Strategy. \'The term
\"cybersecurity regime\" will be used in this article referring to the
definition of Oran Young as a \"complex regime\" because cybersecurity
is not yet a consolidated regime but it is in the process to become one
and in that sense, this article helps to establish the existence of a
regime when referring to cybersecurity. A \"regime complex\" is a
collection of governance arrangements that are linked together in the
sense that they address matters related to a common issue area or
spatially defined region but that are not hierarchically related in the
sense that they all fit within some well-defined institutional
architecture. The originators and theorists of this way of thinking
about governance have focused on cases like the regime complex for plant
genetic resource and the regime complex of climate change. Regime
complexes vary dramatically along a spectrum ranging from severe
fragmentation to close-knit integration. For \"regime complex\" see
Oran, 2012. Building and International Regime Complex for the Arctic:
Current Status and Next Steps, The Polar Journal, No. 2, pp. 391-407.

#### Cybersecurity concerns the capacity of the existing system

[[Cyber]{.mark}security [refers to]{.mark} the \"[capacity for network

protecting them [from attack]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"151 The relevant
competent departments may order the organisations to make corrections,
and can, according to the circumstances, confiscate any illegal income
made and impose a fine of not less than one time and not more than ten
times the illegal gains. If there are no illegal gains, a fine up to
1,000,000 yuan shall be imposed, and the person in charge and other
persons directly responsible shall be fined not less than 10,000 yuan
but not more than 100,000 yuan. If the circumstances are serious, the
relevant departments can suspend the organisations\' relevant business
and revoke their business licenses.

### Aff- Includes Resilience

#### Cybersecurity refers to tech resilience and protection

**Dong 14** [(Qingling Dong; applied scientist with a PhD in deep
machine learning, "*Confidence Building for Cybersecurity between China
and the United States*"
\[https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&handle=hein.journals/chintersd47&id=61&size=2&collection=journals&terms=cybersecurity%20refers%20to&termtype=phrase&set_as_cursor=1\]

For instance, even on the question of how to define cybersecurity. [For
the Chinese authorities and media, cybersecurity means technological
safety and political stability]{.underline}. In other words, the Chinese
side emphasizes information content and safety, and they state that
cyberspace should not develop into a realm for political struggle. [For
the United States, however, [cyber]{.mark}security [refers to
technological resilience]{.mark}, intellectual property [protection and
privacy]{.mark}]{.underline}. In short, the United States side stresses
the freedom of cyberspace and data protection.

### Aff- No Standard Definition

#### "Cybersecurity" is inherently imprecise- no standard definition

[[Cyber]{.mark}security [refers to]{.mark} a broad set of concepts for
which there is [no standard definition]{.mark}-it often [varies by the
entity employing it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [DHS, for example, has defined
cybersecurity as \"the activity or process, ability or
capability]{.underline}, or state whereby information and communications
systems and the information contained therein are protected from and/or
defended against damage, unauthorized use or modification, or
exploitation.\"\' [The Committee on National Security Systems has
defined a \"cyber attack\" as An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an
enterprise\'s use of cyberspace]{.underline} for the purpose of
disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a
computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the
data or stealing controlled information.
