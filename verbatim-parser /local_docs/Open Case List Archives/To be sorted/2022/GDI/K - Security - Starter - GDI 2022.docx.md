# SECURITY

## 1NC

#### Discourses of security are a neoliberal regime aimed at the total pacification of the public, protecting the state and capital through normalization of bourgeois values and suppression of dissent.

[**Neocleous 18** \[Mark, Prof of the Critique of Political Economy at
Brunel Univ, "The bleak rituals of progress; or, if somebody offers you
a socially responsible innovation in security, just say no," in J. Peter
Burgess, *Socially Responsible Innovation in Security*, p.133-6,
GDI-JCR\]]{.underline}

Witness, for example, the phenomenon that has been described as
neoliberalism. Much can and has been made of the ways in which
**[[neoliberalism]{.mark} involves a transformation of the
individual]{.underline}**: 'economics are the method; the object is to
change the heart and soul', as Margaret Thatcher (Sunday Times, 1981)
once put it. Taking such a claim seriously means reading neoliberalism
not simply in terms of its destructive power, for example in destroying
certain kinds of rights and institutions, but also in terms of its
productive power: in its ability to create new kinds of social
relations, new ways of living and new political subjects. The literature
on the new neoliberal subject recognizes more than anything that **[what
is being [produced]{.mark} is [an entrepreneurial self and a productive
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}**: a monetized, atomized and calculating
subject that is required and expected to endlessly perform as a
neoliberal subject in the social realm as well as in the marketplace
(Dardot and Laval, 2013). **[This production of new
subjectivities]{.underline}**, however, **[is also very much an
orientation of the subject [around security]{.mark}: new political
subjects forged through security, operating for security and organized
around security.]{.underline}** In other words, security- conscious
neoliberal subjects. **[[The connection between security and capital
is]{.mark} thus [integral to]{.mark} the neoliberal revolution and part
of [neoliberalism's productive power and disciplinary
core.]{.mark}]{.underline}** (As with so many aspects of neoliberalism,
what is of most interest is its disciplinary moment, and at the heart of
this disciplinary moment lies the logic of security.) The explosion and
expansion of security in the last two decades, while conventionally
connected to the problem of terrorism (the 'war on terror'), might just
as properly be connected to the attempt to engrain neoliberalism into
the hearts and minds of political subjects. Moreover, because the
neoliberal subject is expected to be an active subject, this activity is
also expected to respond to the demands of security as well as the
demands of capital. As is well known, under neoliberalism it is no
longer enough for us to simply work, earn our money, go home and spend
it. Now we must believe in the work we are doing and actively show that
we believe in it, identifying with the organization and signing up to
the company's mission, vision and values. The neoliberal workplace has
become a 'community of desire', as Frédéric Lordon puts it, and yet this
poses a problem for capital, which constantly questions the worker's
desire. In Lordon's example: the employee- subject swears that they have
no other passion than the manufacture of yoghurt, our company's
business, but can we really believe them? (Lordon, 2015, p. 84). The
answer has to be no, and so the expected desire must be constantly
expressed, measured and assessed, since it is always in danger of
fading. A similar point might be made about the neoliberal polity, and
likewise about the neoliberal security state: the citizen- subject
swears that they have no other interest than the security of the social
order, but can we really believe them? The answer must again be no,2 and
so the expected desire must also be constantly expressed, measured and
assessed, since it is always in danger of fading. Herein lies the basis
for all the actions we are now being trained to undertake as security-
conscious neoliberal subjects, such as being trained in 'resilience',
being taught to be constantly 'prepared for emergency', and being
encouraged to report any friends, family, lovers, neighbours and
colleagues who we suspect might be doing something 'suspicious'
(Neocleous, 2013, 2016, 2017). Part of the novelty of neoliberalism lies
precisely in the idea that this active subject is not expected to remain
content with the simple exchange of security for obedience, but, rather,
is to be actively mobilized around the logic of security. **[[Security
has become a]{.mark} neoliberal [mobilization regime: the people
mobilized in the name of security as well as
capital.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Such mobilization is yet another way of
incorporating the people into security and another way in which security
expresses its desire to exist without reply, just like capital and the
state. Part of the illusion of security is that we are expected to bow
down before it without even asking what it is or how it came to be
granted such a status. To exist without reply, **[[security seeks to
nullify]{.mark} all [dissent and suppress]{.mark} any re[bellion even
before such]{.mark} dissent and rebellion [have
begun.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Any objections or resistance to any of the
policies -- not least the economic policies -- being carried out by the
powers which claim to exercise security on our behalf are met either
with security measures of the most coercive kind or with the expectation
that reason must abase itself before it -- all our critical faculties
set aside as security and its leading defenders tell us to shut up,
listen and obey. Those arguing against austerity, for example, are
treated first and foremost as a threat to national security. Thus, far
from security being emancipation, as some people working in the academic
sector of the security industry like to claim and which is the very
belief that security wants us to hold**[, the articulation of [security
as a]{.mark}n overarching [principle of politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**
-- the idea, in other words, that security is the absolute foundation of
all politics, or that security has to be the starting point for any
political thought, or that security is the grounds on which we must
accept the protection of the state, or that what all of us would most
like for Christmas is security -- **[[is nothing less than the]{.mark}
articulation of a [demand for obedience.]{.mark} Security is in this
sense [central to the containment of social change]{.mark}, nothing less
than the principle and process of pacification]{.underline}**, if by
'pacification' we understand **[[not simply the military crushing of
resistance but]{.mark}, rather, [the fabrication of social
order]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Neocleous, 2011, 2017; Neocleous, Rigakos
and Wall, 2013). What does this obedience in the name of security
produce? The answer is not difficult: obedience itself. **[Obedience
produces obedience]{.underline}**, as Foucault once commented (2014, p.
270) about what he called 'pastoral power'. **[It reproduces itself as a
system of obedience.]{.underline}** That is, one accepts the principle
of security in order to become obedient and one reproduces this state of
obedience in a striving for the mythical state of security. Hence **[one
is expected to manage oneself in the way that a security operative would
have us be managed.]{.underline}** This is the very point to which
Hobbes alludes in the final paragraph of Leviathan; it is the very same
point understood by all contemporary politicians when they speak the
language of security; and it is the point implicit in much of the
discourse and policies surrounding terrorism, which is why so much anti-
terror legislation concerns itself with the obedience of the population.
**[[Obedience]{.mark} thereby [becomes a permanent way of being, and we
are]{.mark} encouraged and [expected to believe that obedience is
essential to the security of the subject.]{.mark} Obedience becomes
fundamental to the principle of raison d'état, [demanded by the
state]{.mark} for security reasons, [and]{.mark} our training in
obedience a training of and [for political order]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
And, given the security--commodity nexus, what we are being made
obedient for is nothing other than the domination of our lives by
capital. Security, then, demands that we bow down to security. It
demands that we feel secure in our insecurity as bourgeois subjects but
also insecure in our security as bourgeois subjects. **[[It demands that
we commit ourselves]{.mark} not to making history but, rather, to the
eternal recurrence of the same: to [securing capital and the state
rather than anything against it or opposed to
them.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Like capital, security wants us to believe
that it is our fate. Opening his book Politics and Fate, Andrew Gamble
asks: 'If politics were at an end, if this was our fate, what would this
mean for us?' (2000, p. 1). One answer: it would mean nothing less than
being stuck in an endless security experience. 'How was your security
experience today?', the questionnaire at Heathrow airport demands, after
making us undergo a series of security rituals. An endless security
experience, then, but one in which we are constantly asked to assess,
measure and confirm our happiness in being able to participate in the
rituals and thus in the process to confirm the extent to which security
dominates our lives. A second answer to Gamble's question**[: it would
mean being subjected to one security innovation after another, including
those innovations sold to us as being somehow 'socially
responsible'.]{.underline}**

#### \*\*\*Optionally Insert Additional Specific Links\*\*\*

#### War and apocalypse are inherent to the world order. Redirecting the affective economies of war can't happen through plans for conflict prevention -- only new affective attachments that affirm being in excess of regulative models of international relations can truly affirm life.

[**Grove 19** \[Jairus, Assoc Prof of International Relations at Univ of
Hawai'i at Manoa, *Savage Ecology: War and Geopolitics at the End of the
World*, p.229-30\]]{.underline}

As I find little inspiration in the technological optimism of the
singularity or a cosmopolitan future and no hope in the inevitability of
power politics, **[I want [to try to make more visible]{.mark} where I
see [the possibilities of making a life amid a
dying]{.mark}]{.underline}** or worse yet expanding **[Eurocene
[civilization.]{.mark} What I offer here is not an alternative world
order]{.underline}** or a new categorical imperative. Instead, I want to
sketch out what possibilities I think might exist in the terrain of
apocalypse and war for those of us moderns no longer interested in being
along for the ride. 1 **[The possibility of catastrophe, while always
present, is more or less open to creative intervention.]{.underline}**
Even if there is no way out, so to speak, sadism is not the only
condition for persisting. So **[[rather than start from the position of
how to end war]{.mark} or transcend the Eurocene, I would rather think
about [what other becomings]{.mark} are in the neighborhood of the
Eurocene's martial order but [are in flight away from this epoch's cruel
trajectories]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This puts me in stark contrast to
many thinkers in international relations (IR) who most often seek peace.
This is because rather than attend to these subtle and deeply ecological
practices of war and homogenization, **[liberal [i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations [theory]{.mark}, whether it be the democratic peace
theorist or the providential tone of cosmopolitans, [tries]{.mark}, like
Kant, [to expel war from the world while maintaining a modern order
entirely indebted to it.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Despite Kant's
predictions for an end of war as part of "nature's secret plan," or as
the cosmopolitan "desire" of man, or Hegel's completion of the liberal
democratic state, **[[global war and apocalypse are not things that can
be]{.mark} outlawed, [regulated, and governed]{.mark} out of existence
[as they are too intimate with the very order these visions of the world
hope to elevate]{.mark} over war and competition.]{.underline}** To
understand global war and apocalypse as a becoming is not only to lay
bare the facile and destitute liberal understanding of peace and the
future but to open up explorations of a becoming otherwise than the
Eurocene. Such a becoming is likely to be illegible to the current
indexes of progress and global order. **[The normative markers of
peace---[the absence of conflict---need not define the limit of possible
becomings]{.mark} other than war. Becoming agonistic, becoming active,
becoming rage, becoming justice, becoming quiet, becoming still,
becoming disobedient, becoming graceful, becoming kind, becoming
indifferent, becoming defiant, becoming gentle, becoming sacrifice,
becoming fire]{.underline}** (as many monks in Vietnam did and at least
three individuals in the United States have in the face of the Iraq
War), **[becoming generous, becoming courageous, becoming feral . . .
[The restoration of belief in the world requires an affirmation of being
in excess of a regulative or repressive model of peace and progress. War
and the drive to homogenization]{.mark} endemic to the Eurocene cannot
be disowned or expelled. They [must be diverted by other incipient
becomings]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Other forks must be taken. This does
not require that the world slow down. It might require that we unblock
certain flows corralled by the arborescent strategies of fortress state
craft. **[[Redirecting the affective economies of war toward other
attachments]{.mark}---arguments, [justice, compassion,
forgiveness]{.mark}, politics, resistance, [grief, art, beauty, the
world---cannot be accomplished by repression]{.mark} or separation; that
is a recipe for ressentiment.]{.underline}** To understand the processes
of becoming that enliven and rigidify the Eurocene is to understand the
possibility of becoming something else. If we externalize or banish the
Eurocene to the place of evil or outside ourselves in the name of some
new alliance, we fail to understand just how indebted the modern form of
life is to the Eurocene**[. [In this moment]{.mark}---returned to us by
a kind of attunement to depth of this catastrophe---[we might find
other]{.mark} practices, bodily dispositions,
[emotions]{.mark}]{.underline}**: grief rather than rage, compassion
rather than revenge, determination rather than resignation. For some the
otherwise will only give contrast to the power of hate or rage to
overcome other impulses, but in others **[[it may spawn other
directions]{.mark}; new questions, [alternatives to the]{.mark}
dissatisfaction, or [burnout from rage, hate, and revenge.]{.mark} I am
a pessimist but I am not a nihilist.]{.underline}**

**[War as defined by [classical war studies]{.mark} suggests a distinct
class of actors, interests, aims, and expertise. As a result, the study
of war]{.underline}** as well as much of the social mobilization of war
**[[presumes an exteriority of war]{.mark} and warfare [from other
sectors]{.mark} and institutions [like the economy or the
state.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For those who study military history,
war---in this limited understanding---can certainly be decisive in the
rise and fall of nation-states and even transformations of the global
system when that system is only indexed by the states that populate it,
but the pursuit of these histories still presumes a kind of exceptional
character of war. **[[War following this line of thought is a
cataclysmic event that interrupts]{.mark} the otherwise normal character
of [daily life.]{.mark}]{.underline}** For others, particularly in the
field of strategic studies, **[warfare is a tool, an instrument whereby
states and sometimes organizations pursue ends beyond the limits of
politics and persuasion.]{.underline}** War compels and determines a
course of action as an orchestral direction of overwhelming force.
**[For those who hope to abolish war, a parallel exteriority animates
their theorizing about war. War, according to these thinkers, is
reducible to the self-interest of hegemonic states, the militarism of
soldiers, and the self-amplifying loop of profit and
power.]{.underline}** Presidents, generals, CEOs, arms dealers, and
patriots come together to pursue war as an end in itself. Again,
**[those actors and those pursuits are treated as outside the normal
realm of human social relations. [But what if war is history?]{.mark}
What if [the very form of life that]{.mark} created]{.underline}**, was
reinforced by, mutated with, **[and [emerged from the Eurocene is
warlike]{.mark}? State-making, territorialization, [expansion,
annihilation, settlement, and globalization are all]{.mark} warlike
relations.]{.underline}** I want to consider the possibility of **[war
and warlike relations as processes of making [a form of life in which
warfare is normal.]{.mark}]{.underline}** And what I mean by normal is
much more than what we mean when we use concepts like ideology or
legitimacy or discipline. By normal, I mean **[the very fabric of
relations that makes a form of life and a world: a war body, a war
assemblage, a war ecology.]{.underline}** I am not suggesting that war
is the only form of life. There are surviving forms of life interior and
exterior to the Eurocene. No process of annihilation succeeds without
leaving at least a trace.3 However, **[[the normal workings of daily
global life are a state of war.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Rather than think
of state of war in the juridical or theoretical sense, which distinguish
war from peace on the grounds of declarations or measures of order, I
want to consider war as an ecology endemic to the Eurocene. So by state
of war I mean state in the sense that physicists or chemists think about
states of matter. Every state of matter is an order, and despite that
order, every state of matter has some elements of other states. A state
of matter exhibits properties like solidity, liquidity, gaseousness, or
the full-on freak-out of plasma but is not entirely made up of that
state. And yet the state still has an effect despite that heterogeneity.
So to say that **[we live in a global state of war, and that the making
of the Eurocene was that making of a global state of war, is to say that
war intensifies the field of relations that make the world what it is
right now]{.underline}**, not that it exhausts the possibility of what
the world can become. Instead, **[the practices and organizations---
[from resource extraction]{.mark}, enclosure, carbon liberation,
racialization, [mass incarceration, border enforcement, policing and
security practices]{.mark}, primitive accumulation by dispossession,
[targeted strikes, to all-out combat]{.mark}---are relations of
war]{.underline}** rather than merely correlates or opportunities for a
war metaphor. To put it a bit more bluntly, **[[politics, colonialism,
settlement, capitalism, ecological destruction, racism, and misogynies
are not wars by other means---they are war. War]{.mark} is not a
metaphor; it [is an intensive fabric of relations making the
Eurocene]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To make this claim requires
rethinking---somewhat bombastically---the meaning of war. If war has
such a wide application, it would seem to mean nothing. In talks,
roundtables, and casual conversations, colleagues have often suggested
that such an expansive definition of war is polemical or even absurd.
Others have said that spreading war so thin cheapens the sacrifices and
tragedies of those who have experienced "real war." It is curious to me
that many of the same people have no difficulty assigning similar base
or structuring characteristics to capitalism, settlement, or patriarchy.
I do not see war as a replacement or a displacement of those structuring
structures. Instead, war is like those other complicated, heterogeneous,
abstract machines but interrelated and importantly semiautonomous in the
making of the world. The importance of shifting the point of emphasis or
break between war and other "big processes" is to emphasize the way
**[collectively making death comes to be its own organizing ecology
rather than just an instrumental means for other ecologies, such as
racism or sexism or capitalism]{.underline}**, that are often more
obviously invested in ordering---subordinating orders--- than
destruction. Furthermore, **[I do not think, given the extreme level of
violence and deprivation necessary to create the global ecology we now
inhabit, that it is "a stretch" to call war [the constitutive fabric of
planetary relations.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Instead, **[war as an
intensive difference takes possession of other
categories]{.underline}**, at which point phase shifts take place in
categories like racism or economics. **[What was the slow, lethal burn
of post-slavery policing escalates into the fury of outright combat in
the streets, a race war in the streets of 1921 Tulsa or the 2015 streets
of Baltimore.]{.underline}** Even in our sacred texts of democratic
theory, the pulsing tributaries of war run throughout descriptions of
political formation. John Locke argued with little dispute that slavery
was the institutionalization of war.4 And W. E. B. Du Bois said of the
process of reconstruction after slavery that war had begun again, and in
fact had never ended.5 Do we think that the same could not be said for
the vast carceral project directed at black people described so well by
Michelle Alexander or Loïc Wacquant?6

#### Our impact comes first---Structural violence is the proximate cause of all war- creates priming that psychologically structures escalation

[**Scheper-Hughes and Bourgois 04** (Prof of Anthropology @ Cal-Berkely;
Prof of Anthropology @ UPenn) (Nancy and Philippe, Introduction: Making
Sense of Violence, in Violence in War and Peace, pg. 19-22)]{.underline}

This large and at first sight "messy" Part VII is central to this
anthology's thesis. It encompasses everything from the routinized,
bureaucratized, and utterly banal violence of children dying of hunger
and maternal despair in Northeast Brazil (Scheper-Hughes, Chapter 33) to
elderly African Americans dying of heat stroke in Mayor Daly's version
of US apartheid in Chicago's South Side (Klinenberg, Chapter 38) to the
racialized class hatred expressed by British Victorians in their
olfactory disgust of the "smelly" working classes (Orwell, Chapter 36).
In these readings violence is located in the symbolic and social
structures that overdetermine and allow the criminalized drug
addictions, interpersonal bloodshed, and racially patterned
incarcerations that characterize the US "inner city" to be normalized
(Bourgois, Chapter 37 and Wacquant, Chapter 39). Violence also takes the
form of class, racial, political self-hatred and adolescent
self-destruction (Quesada, Chapter 35), as well as of useless (i.e.
preventable), rawly embodied physical suffering, and death (Farmer,
Chapter 34). **[Absolutely [central]{.mark} to our approach [is a
blurring of]{.mark} categories and distinctions between [wartime and
peacetime violence]{.mark}. Close attention to the "little" violences
produced in the structures, habituses, and mentalites of everyday life
shifts our attention to pathologies of class, race, and gender
inequalities.]{.underline}** More important, it interrupts the
voyeuristic tendencies of "violence studies" that risk publicly
humiliating the powerless who are often forced into complicity with
social and individual pathologies of power because suffering is often a
solvent of human integrity and dignity. Thus, in this anthology we are
positing a violence continuum comprised of a multitude of "small wars
and invisible genocides" (see also Scheper- Hughes 1996; 1997; 2000b)
conducted in the normative social spaces of public schools, clinics,
emergency rooms, hospital wards, nursing homes, courtrooms, public
registry offices, prisons, detention centers, and public morgues. [**The
violence continuum also refers to the ease with which [humans are
capable of reducing the socially vulnerable into expendable
nonpersons]{.mark} and assuming the license - even the duty - to kill,
maim, or soul-murder**.]{.underline} We realize that in referring to a
violence and a genocide continuum we are flying in the face of a
tradition of genocide studies that argues for the absolute uniqueness of
the Jewish Holocaust and for vigilance with respect to restricted purist
use of the term genocide itself (see Kuper 1985; Chaulk 1999; Fein 1990;
Chorbajian 1999). But we hold an opposing and alternative view that, to
the contrary, [**it is absolutely necessary to make just such
existential leaps in purposefully linking violent acts in normal times
to those of abnormal times**.]{.underline} Hence the title of our
volume: Violence in War and in Peace. If (as we concede) there is a
moral risk in overextending the concept of "genocide" into spaces and
corners of everyday life where we might not ordinarily think to find it
(and **[[there is]{.mark}), an even greater [risk]{.mark} lies in
failing to sensitize ourselves, [in misrecognizing protogenocidal
practices]{.mark} and sentiments [daily enacted]{.mark} as normative
behavior by "ordinary" good-enough citizens. Peacetime
crimes]{.underline}**, such as prison construction sold as economic
development to impoverished communities in the mountains and deserts of
California, or the evolution of the criminal industrial complex into the
latest peculiar institution for managing race relations in the United
States (Waquant, Chapter 39), **[constitute the "small wars and
invisible genocides"]{.underline}** to which we refer. This applies to
African American and Latino youth mortality statistics in Oakland,
California, Baltimore, Washington DC, and New York City. **[[These are
"invisible" genocides]{.mark} not [because they are]{.mark} secreted
away or hidden from view, but quite the opposite.]{.underline}** As
Wittgenstein observed[**, the things that are hardest to perceive are
those which are [right before our eyes and]{.mark} therefore [taken for
granted]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In this regard, Bourdieu's partial and
unfinished theory of violence (see Chapters 32 and 42) as well as his
concept of misrecognition is crucial to our task. By including the
normative everyday forms of violence hidden in the minutiae of "normal"
social practices - in the architecture of homes, in gender relations, in
communal work, in the exchange of gifts, and so forth - Bourdieu forces
us to reconsider the broader meanings and status of violence, especially
the links between the violence of everyday life and explicit political
terror and state repression, Similarly, Basaglia's notion of "peacetime
crimes" - crimini di pace - imagines a direct relationship between
wartime and peacetime violence. **[[Peacetime crimes suggests]{.mark}
the possibility that [war crimes are]{.mark} merely [ordinary, everyday
crimes of public consent applied systematically]{.mark} and dramatically
[in the extreme context of war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Consider the
parallel uses of rape during peacetime and wartime, or the family
resemblances between the legalized violence of US immigration and
naturalization border raids on "illegal aliens" versus the US
government- engineered genocide in 1938, known as the Cherokee "Trail of
Tears." Peacetime crimes suggests that everyday forms of state violence
make a certain kind of domestic peace possible. Internal "stability" is
purchased with the currency of peacetime crimes, many of which take the
form of professionally applied "strangle-holds." Everyday forms of state
violence during peacetime make a certain kind of domestic "peace"
possible. It is an easy-to-identify peacetime crime that is usually
maintained as a public secret by the government and by a scared or
apathetic populace. Most subtly, but no less politically or
structurally, the phenomenal growth in the United States of a new
military, postindustrial prison industrial complex has taken place in
the absence of broad-based opposition, let alone collective acts of
civil disobedience. **[The public consensus is based primarily on a new
mobilization of an old fear of the mob, the mugger, the rapist, the
Black man, the undeserving poor. How many public executions of mentally
deficient prisoners in the United States are needed to make life feel
more secure for the affluent?]{.underline}** What can it possibly mean
when incarceration becomes the "normative" socializing experience for
ethnic minority youth in a society, i.e., over 33 percent of young
African American men (Prison Watch 2002). In the end **[[it is essential
that we]{.mark} recognize the existence of a genocidal capacity among
otherwise good-enough humans and that we need to [exercise]{.mark} a
defensive [hypervigilance to]{.mark} the less dramatic, permitted, and
even rewarded [everyday acts of violence that render participation in
genocidal acts]{.mark} and policies [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(under adverse political or economic conditions), perhaps more easily
than we would like to recognize. [**Under the violence continuum we
include, therefore, all expressions of radical social exclusion,
dehumanization, depersonal- ization, pseudospeciation, and reification
which normalize atrocious behavior and violence toward others. A
constant self-mobilization for alarm, a state of constant hyperarousal
is, perhaps, a reasonable response to Benjamin's view of late modern
history as a chronic "state of emergency**"]{.underline} (Taussig,
Chapter 31). We are trying to recover here the classic anagogic thinking
that enabled Erving Goffman, Jules Henry, C. Wright Mills, and Franco
Basaglia among other mid-twentieth-century radically critical thinkers,
to perceive the symbolic and structural relations, i.e., between inmates
and patients, between concentration camps, prisons, mental hospitals,
nursing homes, and other "total institutions." **[Making that decisive
move to recognize the continuum of violence allows us to see the
capacity and the willingness - if not enthusiasm - of ordinary people,
the practical technicians of the social consensus, to enforce
genocidal-like crimes against categories of rubbish people. [There is no
primary impulse out of which mass violence and genocide are born, it is
ingrained in the common sense of everyday social life]{.mark}. The mad,
the differently abled, the mentally vulnerable have often fallen into
this category of the unworthy living, as have the very old and infirm,
the sick-poor, and, of course, the despised racial, religious, sexual,
and ethnic groups of the moment.]{.underline}** Erik Erikson referred to
"pseudo- speciation" as the human tendency to classify some individuals
or social groups as less than fully human - a prerequisite to genocide
and one that is carefully honed during the unremark- able peacetimes
that precede the sudden, "seemingly unintelligible" outbreaks of mass
violence**[. Collective denial and misrecognition are prerequisites for
mass violence and genocide.]{.underline}** But so are formal
bureaucratic structures and professional roles. The practical
technicians of everyday violence in the backlands of Northeast Brazil
(Scheper-Hughes, Chapter 33), for example, include the clinic doctors
who prescribe powerful tranquilizers to fretful and frightfully hungry
babies, the Catholic priests who celebrate the death of "angel-babies,"
and the municipal bureaucrats who dispense free baby coffins but no food
to hungry families. **[Everyday violence encompasses the implicit,
legitimate, and routinized forms of violence inherent in particular
social, economic, and political formations.]{.underline}** It is close
to what Bourdieu (1977, 1996) means by "symbolic violence," the violence
that is often "nus-recognized" for something else, usually something
good. Everyday violence is similar to what Taussig (1989) calls "terror
as usual." All these terms are meant to reveal a public secret - the
hidden links between violence in war and violence in peace, and between
war crimes and "peace-time crimes." Bourdieu (1977) finds domination and
violence in the least likely places - in courtship and marriage, in the
exchange of gifts, in systems of classification, in style, art, and
culinary taste- the various uses of culture. Violence, Bourdieu insists,
is everywhere in social practice. It is misrecognized because its very
everydayness and its familiarity render it invisible. Lacan identifies
"rneconnaissance" as the prerequisite of the social. The exploitation of
bachelor sons, robbing them of autonomy, independence, and progeny,
within the structures of family farming in the European countryside that
Bourdieu escaped is a case in point (Bourdieu, Chapter 42; see also
Scheper-Hughes, 2000b; Favret-Saada, 1989). Following Gramsci, Foucault,
Sartre, Arendt, and other modern theorists of power-vio- lence, Bourdieu
treats direct aggression and physical violence as a crude, uneconomical
mode of domination; it is less efficient and, according to Arendt
(1969), it is certainly less legitimate. While power and symbolic
domination are not to be equated with violence - and Arendt argues
persuasively that violence is to be understood as a failure of power -
violence, as we are presenting it here, is more than simply the
expression of illegitimate physical force against a person or group of
persons. Rather, we need to understand violence as encompassing all
forms of "controlling processes" (Nader 1997b) that assault basic human
freedoms and individual or collective survival. Our task is to recognize
these gray zones of violence which are, by definition, not obvious. Once
again, the point of bringing into the discourses on genocide everyday,
normative experiences of reification, depersonalization, institutional
confinement, and acceptable death is to help answer the question: What
makes mass violence and genocide possible? In this volume we are
suggesting **[that mass violence is part of a continuum, and that it is
socially incremental and often experienced by perpetrators,
collaborators, bystanders - and even by victims themselves - as
expected, routine, even justified]{.underline}**. The preparations for
mass killing can be found in social sentiments and institutions from the
family, to schools, churches, hospitals, and the military. **[[They
harbor the]{.underline}]{.mark}** early "warning signs" (Charney 1991),
the **["[priming]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (as Hinton, ed., 2002 calls
it), or the "genocidal continuum" (as we call it) **[[that push social
consensus toward devaluing certain forms of human
life]{.underline}]{.mark}** and lifeways from the refusal of social
support and humane care to vulnerable "social parasites" (the nursing
home elderly, "welfare queens," undocumented immigrants, drug addicts)
to the militarization of everyday life (super-maximum-security prisons,
capital punishment; the technologies of heightened personal security,
including the house gun and gated communities; and reversed feelings of
victimization).

### 2NC AT Proximate Causes

#### War is a way of life -- focus on particular decisions, legal codes and events distracts from the subterranean affective ties that animate the structures of war as a way of life

[**Grove 19** \[Jairus, Assoc Prof of International Relations at Univ of
Hawai'i at Manoa, *Savage Ecology: War and Geopolitics at the End of the
World*, p.74-7\]]{.underline}

**[War is what escapes and deterritorializes constraints.]{.underline}**
Contrary to those like Martin Heidegger or Theodor Adorno who see war as
a pure instrumentality, the ignoble novelty of violence demonstrates
that the enframing of war is never complete. The standing reserve of
warfare (soldiers, bullets, bombs, civilians to be protected, totals of
enemies to be killed, etc.) is never wholly subsumed as a resource or
instrument. The fog of war, unforeseen escalation, levée en masse,
low-tech assemblages, blind allies, ad hoc militias, and the defensive
advantage of weakness express the creative elements of war as they have
been named; however, this list is not exhaustive. It is not an
exaggeration to say that no historical development of humanity has
entirely escaped the gravitational pull of war. It would be more
accurate to say that **[war has organized a common and highly dispersed
martial form of life that thrives in the Eurocene.]{.underline}** We do
not like to ask the question, but what if **[ever-present violence has
become a way of being]{.underline}**, a form of life? What would it mean
to speak of war as a "fabric of immanent relations" rather than merely a
regrettable means for politics?49 As scholars of war and geopolitics, in
my estimation, we do not take seriously enough the metamorphoses of war.
**[[War is often relegated by analysts to the status of an effect or an
object rather than a concept unto itself. So wars are declared; wars are
waged; wars are ended]{.mark}; war is even outlawed. People do not speak
of war as they do the political]{.underline}**, the ethical, and so on.
We need to consider what centuries of wars do. What is war's analogue to
the political as the political is to politics? This is important if we
want to consider that just **[maybe the martial is more central than the
political or ethical to the forms of life that thrive and expand in the
Eurocene.]{.underline}** Like politics or ethics, each tactile act in
warfare is another comportment of the body, a technique of musculature,
posture, style, gait, each with its own possibility not just to survive
war but to live war.50 And the life that emerges, spreads. This raises a
series of questions ignored by normative investigation of how we ought
to fight or what would constitute a just war. For example: How long can
peace be absent before the body finds its satisfaction in an assemblage
of war rather than in the "beauty" or justness of peace? When does a
body or collective find the transition to peace to be as abrupt and
violent as the outbreak of conflict? And are we really so convinced of a
future "pacific" human society, as Kant was in his Theses for a
Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Intent (1784), that we cannot
imagine warfare ceasing to be an aberration? Hasn't it already for the
powers that organize the international order? The stakes here are not
trivial; there is no providence that guarantees we are meant to live in
peace, which means there are also no natural laws to prevent us from
fully becoming war. And **[how many centuries has war come to define the
expansion, integration, and annihilating homogenization of planetary
relations?]{.underline}** How many generations of bodies since 1492 have
been created by a state of war? To answer these questions, the body in
**[[war has to be taken up as a body rather than a rational agent
weighing the costs and benefits of]{.mark} conforming to norms or
following international [legal codes.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There is no
agent before the body. And the swing of a machete and the sight of a gun
may be no different from the infra-assemblage of our bodies than the
swing of a bat or the sighting of a jump shot. As Erin Manning puts it,
this is "the body, more assemblage than form, more associated milieu
than Being."51 What differs is a minimal difference in affect rather
than a transcendental moral calling. Manning again states, "Affect
promises nothing. It creates across and beyond good and evil."52
Therefore, the body is charged no less by hate, anger, rage, and fear
than it is by joy, pleasure, and generosity. It is just charged
differently. 53 The swing of an arm can be the opening of a dance or the
mad plunge of a bayonet. For Merleau-Ponty, this is what characterizes
the human, the body, and contingency made form: "Man is an historical
idea, not a natural species. In other words, there is no unconditioned
possession in human existence, and yet neither is there any fortuitous
attribute. Human existence will lead us to revisit our usual notion of
necessity and of contingency, because human existence is the change of
contingency into necessity through the act of taking up."54 The
affective field, the habit of the muscles, and the encounter by which
each of these is engaged alters the effect of the movement, which is
what is signified by the making of "meaning," or what Merleau-Ponty
calls the "taking up." The effect is made sensible---bodily and
habitual---and retrospectively we call this meaning. The movement itself
is indivisible and intentional rather than instrumental and willful.55
At first glance, this appears as a contradiction, intentional but not
willful; however, Merleau-Ponty has a process in mind that requires us
(intention) but is not reducible to our interiority (will). He describes
the making of a new body as a process of meaning-making whereby "the new
meaningful intention only knows itself by donning already available
significations, which are the results of previous acts of expression.
The available significations suddenly intertwine according to an unknown
law, and once and for all a new cultural being has begun to exist."56 In
war, new bodies are made, but not by war any more than war is made by
bodies. Instead, there is what Massumi describes as an "instantaneous
back-and- forthing between now and the future, and between disparate
domains of activity. . . . The strike of paradox renders the gesture
inventively 'undecidable'--- in addition to being true."57 In the slight
difference between axe swings---one to chop wood, the other to sever
arms---is the incipient possibility of different "cultural beings" and
the longue durée of different forms of life. This incipience is
contained not in the decision but in between the world and the body and
then subsequently in the worlds those bodies make. The in-between of
incipience is also not restricted to the human. A slight difference in
urban development---one high-rise to promote downtown living and another
to contain racial difference---may just as easily extend from the
indiscernibility of reality and enable or amplify a particular becoming,
or make it more durable or more contagious. Similarly, **[[we should
puncture the myth]{.mark} that the preparation for war and the
prosecution of war are different in kind. Instead, we should treat the
body and the body of war as an "ecology of process."]{.underline}** 58
In preparation---the becomings of **[[war]{.mark}---it [is not just the
habit of sighting and pulling triggers]{.mark}, innovating new
strategies and the means to eliminate populations]{.underline}** like
the cities of Dresden or Hiroshima. **[[It is the affective
mood]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the technological and urban regulators and
amplifiers of the flows that slow and congeal into new habits---like
dropping a bomb from thirty thousand feet and other incipient
possibilities, pre-adaptations, that might at another moment find
expression, like refusing to launch nuclear weapons in a time of
crisis.59 **[[War makes worlds and worlds make war. Shifting our
interests from events and acts to processes and habits directs our
attention to how the outbreak of war may be subterranean in habitual
activities that are not seemingly warlike.]{.underline}]{.mark}** We
should not be fooled by the common sense that because things are not
always at the fever pitch of war, war is not working behind the scenes
in our imaginative, judging, and bodily faculties as well as our ports,
freeways, internet connections, satellite feed, and toxic runoff,
emotional and molecular. **[Some preparations for war move too slow to
be seen.]{.underline}**60 If we want to attend to war's invitation to be
thought, **[[we must make more vivid those preparations for warfare that
often get lost in political realist discussions of armaments and troop
movement]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like the slow accretion of carbon over
a century or two, the reorganization of waste, the resignification of
belonging, and other more gradual processes in the conversion of
lifeworlds to "operational atmospheres" for past and future wars,
exposing what Sloterdijk calls "new surfaces of vulnerability."61
**[[The consequences of a life of war far exceed any particular battle
or even world war.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

## 2NC Nuclear Imagery

#### The 1AC is addicted to the bomb---evoking images of atomic destruction legitimizes the use of nuclear weapons on a broader scale and condones any "lesser" form of violence

[**Lamarre 2008** \[Thomas, Professor in the Department of Cinema and
Media Studies, East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the Univ of
Chicago, "Born of Trauma: Akira and Capitalist Modes of Destruction,"
positions, vol. 16 no. 1\]]{.underline}

[[Images of atomic destruction]{.mark} and nuclear apocalypse abound in
popular culture, familiar mushroom clouds]{.underline} that leave in
their wake the wholesale destruction of cities, towns, and lands. [Mass
culture **seems to [thrive on repeating the threat of world
annihilation]{.mark},** and the scope of destruction seems continually
to **escalate**: planets, even solar systems, disintegrate in the blink
of an eye; **entire populations vanish.** [We confront in such images a
**compulsion to repeat what terrifies us**, but repetition]{.mark} of
the terror of world annihilation [also **numbs us to it**]{.mark}**, and
[larger doses of destruction become necessary]{.mark}: increases in
magnitude and intensity,**]{.underline} [**in the scale and the quality
of destruction and its imaging**. Ultimately, the [repetition and
escalation promise to inure us to mass destruction, producing **a desire
to get ever closer to it** and at the same time making anything less
than mass destruction feel a]{.mark}]{.underline} relief, a
"**[[victory]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Images of global annihilation
imply a mixture of habituation, fascination, and addiction.
[Trauma]{.underline}, and in particular psychoanalytic questions about
traumatic repetition, [provides a way to grapple with these different
dimensions of our engagement with images of large-scale
destruction.]{.underline} Dominick LaCapra, for instance, returns to
Freud's discussion of "working-through" (mourning) and "acting out"
(melancholia) to think about different ways of repeating trauma. "[In
acting-out]{.underline}," he writes, "[[one has a **mimetic
relation**]{.mark} to the past which is **regenerated or relived** as if
it were fully present rather than represented in memory and
inscription."]{.underline}1 In other words, [[**we repeat the traumatic
event** without any sense of historical or critical distance from
it,]{.mark} precisely **[because the event remains
incomprehensible]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In this conceptualization, [the
repetitious escalation of violence in the imaging of nuclear destruction
entails **[an acting out of our historically traumatic relation
to]{.mark}**]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction
(**[[WMDs]{.underline}]{.mark}**), and especially [**the atomic bomb**.
We face today a proliferation of scenarios that replay our fascination
with WMDs in the lineage of the bomb]{.underline} --- starships blasting
planetary systems out of existence, battles for survival in
postapocalyptic worlds. But [do these scenarios allow us any critical or
historical distance from the trauma of nuclear destruction (Hiroshima
and Nagasaki) and nuclear escalation (the nuclear testing and arms race
of the Cold War)?]{.underline} We must ask if this apparent acting out
of trauma affords any possibilities for working through it. This
question remains urgent. With many nuclear weapons still poised for
launch and with a gradual breakdown of responsibility in chains of
command, nuclear holocaust is as much and maybe more of a danger today
than ever before.

## 2NC Endless War

#### Liberal biopolitical governance risks [unending war]{.underline} against [all]{.underline} threats to the species---that apocalyptic violence will inevitably turn against the species itself. 

[**Dillon and Reid '9** (Michael, professor of Politics at the
University of Lancaster, and Julian, Lecturer in International Relations
at Kings College and Professor of International Relations at the
University of Lapland, "The Liberal Way of War: Killing to Make Life
Live, pg 30-33, JS)]{.underline}

One way of expressing the core problematic that we pursue in this book
is, therefore, in the form of a question posed back to Paine on account
of that definitive claim. [What happens to the liberal way of
rule]{.underline} and its allied way of war [when liberalism goes global
in pursuit of the task of emancipating the species from
war]{.underline}, by taking the biohuman as its referent object of both
rule and war? What happens to war, we ask, when a new form of
governmental regime emerges which attempts to make war in defence and
promotion of the entire species as opposed to using war in service of
the supposedly limited interests of sovereigns? [For the liberal project
of the removal of species life from the domain of human enmity
never]{.underline} in practice **[entailed an end to war]{.underline}**,
**[or to the persistence of threats requiring war.]{.underline}** Paine
makes this clear in his original formulation. [[Under liberal
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}, Paine observes, [war will still be defined
by relations between the human and its enemies. The [enemies of the
human will]{.mark} simply [no longer be]{.mark} '**[its
species']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Paine 1995: 595). [What that
meant]{.underline}, in practice, [was that [the liberal way of rule had
to decide what elements and]{.mark} what [expressions of human life best
served the promotion of the species]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Those that
did not were]{.underline} precisely [those that most threatened
it]{.underline}; those upon which it was called to wage war. Deciding on
what elements and expression of the human both serve and threaten is the
definitive operation by which liberalism constitutes its referent object
of war and rule: that of the biohuman. [Whatever [resists the
constitution of the biohuman is]{.mark} hostile and [dangerous]{.mark}
to it]{.underline}, **[[even if it arises within the species
itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Indeed, as we shall show, [[since life
is]{.mark} now]{.underline} widely [[defined in terms of continuous
emergence]{.mark}]{.underline} and becoming, [it is a continuous
becoming-dangerous to itself.]{.underline} The locus of threat and
danger under the liberal way of rule and war progressively moves into
the very morphogenic composition and re-composability of living systems
and of living material. **[[The greatest source of threat to life
becomes life]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is very important to emphasize
that this discourse of danger is precisely not that which commonly
arises in the political anthropologies of human cupidity of early modern
political theory going back classically, for example, to Hobbes and
Locke, which was nonetheless still formulated in a context still
circumscribed by the infinity of divine providence, however obscure this
was becoming, and however much this obscurity helped fuel the crisis of
their times. [The analytics of finitude]{.underline}, rather than the
analytics of redemption, [circumscribe late modern discourses of
governance and danger now,]{.underline} instead. [Biology]{.underline},
one might therefore also say, [itself arose as a science of finitude; of
the play of species life and death outwith the play of human life and
redemption.]{.underline} The same might very well be said for modern
'political science.' Biology does not, of course, recognize cupidity.
Cupidity arises in a different, anthro-political, order of things. These
days, especially, biology recognizes only the dynamics of complex
adaptive evolutionary emergence and change of living systems, whose very
laws of formation it increasingly understands in informational terms.
These, additionally, empower it to re-compose living material according
to design rather than nature in order to rectify the infelicities of
nature, or, indeed, pre-empt its expression by positively creating new
nature, rather than merely negating existing nature. Pre-emption here is
not negative, it is positive. It is not precaution, so much as creative
production. [[The discourse of danger]{.mark} being [elaborated
through]{.mark} the [liberal]{.mark} way of [rule]{.mark} and
war]{.underline}, in the age of life as information, [[is]{.mark}
therefore [related to the]{.mark} possibility that complex adaptive
emergence and change can go acerbic]{.underline}. [The [possibility of
catastrophe]{.mark} lies]{.underline}, immanently, [[in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[dynamics of the life process]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}. Neither is this a discourse of danger which
revolves around traditional othering practices alone, however pervasive
and persistent these politically toxic devises remain. [[This is a
discourse of danger which]{.mark} [hyperbolicizes fear in relation
to]{.mark} the [radically contingent outcomes upon which the]{.mark}
very [liveliness]{.mark} of life itself [is]{.mark} now [said to
depend]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Biohumanity]{.underline}---itself
an expression of the attempt to give concrete form to finitude
politically---[is therefore both threat and promise. The corollary is
therefore also clear: enemies of the species **must be cast out from the
species** as such]{.underline}. 'Just war' in the cause of humanity
here---a constant liberal trope (Douzinas 2003)---takes a novel turn
when the humanity at issue is biohumanity. For [[just war has constantly
to be waged for biohumanity against]{.mark} the continuous
becoming-dangerous of [life]{.mark} itself;]{.underline} and less in the
form of the Machiavellian or Hobbesian Homo lupus than in the form of
continuously emergent being, something which also prompts the thought
that Foucault's analytics of finitude might itself have to be revised to
take account of the infinity of becoming which now also characterizes
the contemporary ontology of the life sciences. [[Since the object is
to]{.mark} preserve and [promote the biohuman, **any**]{.mark} **such
[war to end war becomes war without end]{.mark};**]{.underline} thus
turning Walzer's arguments concerning the justification of liberal war
inside out (Walzer 2000: 329-335). [The project of removing war from the
life of the species becomes a lethal and]{.underline}, in principle,
continuous and **[unending process]{.underline}**. In a way, as a matter
of its biopolitical logic, there is little particularly startling about
this claim. Immanent in the biopoliticization of liberal rule, **[it is
only a matter of where, when and how it finds expression.]{.underline}**
As the very composition and dynamics of species life become the locus of
the threat to species life, so the properties of species life offer
themselves in the form of a new king of promise: war may be removed from
the species should those properties be attended to differently.
Consider, for example, Kant's 'Idea for a Universal History': if he
lives among others of his own species, man is an animal who needs a
master... he requires a master to break his self-will and force him to
obey a universally valid will under which everyone can be free. But
where is he to find such a master? Nowhere else but in the human
species. (Kant 2005; emphasis added) 'Nowhere else but in the human
species.' Here Kant, too, discloses the circumscription of his
reflections by the analytics of finitude. Put simply, [liberalism's
strategic calculus of necessary killing has]{.underline}, then, [to be
furnished by the laws and dynamics]{.underline}, the exigencies and
contingencies, [derived from the properties of the biohuman itself.
**Making life live becomes the criterion against which the liberal way
of rule and war must seek to say how much killing is
enough**]{.underline}. [[In a]{.mark}]{.underline} massive, quite
literally **[[terrifying, paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however,
[[since the biohuman **is the threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it
cannot]{.underline}]{.mark}, itself, [[adjudicate how much
self-immolation would be enough to secure itself]{.mark} against itself
[without destroying itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} However much the terror
of the liberal way of rule and war currently revolves around the
'figure' of Al-Qaeda, the very dispositive of terror which increasingly
circumscribes the life of the biohuman at the beginning of the
twenty-first century is the fear induced by its very own account of
life. No specific manner or form is proper, then, to the biohuman other
than this: its being continuously at work instrumentally reassigning
itself in order, it is said, to survive, but in fact to secure itself
against its own vital processes. [Within the compass of this
biopolitical imaginary of species existence, the biohuman becomes the
living being to whom all manner of self-securing work must be
assigned]{.underline}. The task thus posed through the liberal way of
rule and war by its referent object of rule and war---the biohuman---is
no longer that, classically, of assigning the human its proper nature
with a view to respecting it. [The proper nature of the biohuman has
become the infinite re-assignability of the very pluripotency itself.
This is the strategic goal of the liberal way of war because it has
become the strategic goal of the liberal way of rule. From the analytics
of finitude]{.underline}, politically, [has]{.underline} thus [arisen an
infinity of securitization and fear.]{.underline}

Rather than starting with a reading of traditional academic analyses of
the Northern Ireland conflict and offering a critique of particular ways
in which the conflict has been represented and analysed in the
literature, this chapter takes a step back. It considers not how or why
the existing literature on the \'troubles\' may be considered to be
lacking in its analysis or its proposed solutions to the problem of
Northern Ireland, but rather examines how that literature could be
argued to be founded on certain prior assumptions, about the conflict
and about the role of academic analysis, that are perhaps in need of
challenge. I do not engage with the specific literature on Northern
Ireland - I am not an expert on that particular topic - rather, I put
forward a series of considerations about the ways in which work about
conflicts, famines, genocides and other traumatic events is or could be
framed. I argue that framings that prevail in much academic or
intellectual work are of a distinct [[\'problem
solving\']{.underline}]{.mark} type, and that the
[[narratives]{.underline}]{.mark} that they produce [**[limit what can
be achieved]{.mark}** in practical]{.underline}, on-the-ground [terms
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} can even be argued to [**[perpetuate the
\'problem\']{.mark}** to which they attempt to provide a
\'solution\']{.underline}. This is particularly the case, I will argue,
where we are concerned with events of a violent, or what could be called
traumatic, type. In summary, then, the chapter addresses \'the problem
of Northern Ireland\' by looking at how problems like this are
constituted as \'problems\' in the first place, and how this then
conditions what forms of \'solution\' become possible. Moreover, it
argues, as does Nick Vaughan-Williams (2006) that such problematisations
are often in part at least to blame for the persistence of the
\'problem\' they appear merely to identify. In a sense the challenge
that will be posed here is one that could be, and indeed has been,
applied to much intellectual work in our particular tradition. The
responsibility of intellectuals more generally is of course one that has
been widely debated, and has resurfaced recently in relation to the
so-called \'war on terror\' (Smith 2004; Edkins 2005). To what extent
can work arising from the ivory tower of academia have any relevance to
the practical political choices faced by policy-makers and their
opponents on a daily basis? How best can concerned academics intervene
in the politics with which they would so like to be involved? Or,
indeed, are they perhaps already deeply implicated in that politics, so
that the question of intervention does not arise? There are two related
but distinct preliminary points that are worth making here. First,
intellectuals are of course not as separate from political and social
structures as might seem to be the case. Antonio Gramsci addresses the
question of whether intellectuals are \'an autonomous and independent
social group\' (Gramsci 1971: 5) as they so often appear. He argues
against looking for criteria that distinguish intellectuals as such \'in
the intrinsic nature of intellectual activities, rather than in the
ensemble of the system of relations in which these activities (and
therefore the intellectual groups who personify them) have their place
within the general complex of social relations\' (Gramsci 1971: 8). We
should focus not on what defines \'an intellectual\' but rather on what
categories are historically made available for intellectual activity and
how struggles for dominance between different groups or classes can be
conceived in these terms. He distinguishes \'traditional
intellectuals,\' on the one hand, who have an apparent neutrality and
absence of class-belongingness, but whose status and authority derives
from their historical position and whose role is as \'the dominant
group\'s \'deputies\', exercising the ... functions of social hegemony
and political government\' (Gramsci 1971: 12) and \'organic
intellectuals,\' on the other, who are part of a subaltern group or
class that is engaged in a struggle for dominance. \'Traditional
intellectuals\' are those who are commonly recognised as intellectuals:
academics, writers, scientists and so on. \'Organic intellectuals,\' on
the other hand, though not recognisable as intellectuals, articulate the
\'new modes of thought\' (Gramsci 1971: 9) of their group. Organic
intellectuals serve to help disrupt rather than reinforce the prevailing
hegemony. The second preliminary point is that contemporary
intellectuals in the Western context operate within a particular
\'\'regime\' of truth\' (Foucault 1980a: 133), one that constitutes as
\'truth\' knowledge that is the product of scientific methods of
working. Michel Foucault argues that the figure of what he calls \'the
specific intellectual\' is of central importance in present day
struggles. Specific intellectuals, such as atomic scientists for
example, who have a \'direct and localised relation to scientific
knowledge and institutions\' (Foucault 1980a: 128) constitute a
political threat because of their ability \'to intervene in contemporary
political struggles in the name of a "local" scientific truth\'
(Foucault 1980a: 129). In other words, because of their status as
experts, and despite the fact that \'the specific intellectual serves
the interests of State or Capital\' (Foucault 1980a: 131), they remain
in a strategic position to intervene on behalf of local struggles. There
are dangers, of course: the risk of remaining at the level of local
struggles, of manipulation or control by other interests, and of not
being able to gain widespread support. Nevertheless, the specific
intellectual should not be discounted (Foucault 1980a: 131). What is
important is the relation between \'truth\' and power, and the way in
which: [[Each society has its regime of truth]{.underline}]{.mark}, its
\'general politics\' of truth: that is, [the types of
discourse]{.underline} which [[it accepts and **makes**]{.mark} function
as [true]{.mark}]{.underline}; the mechanisms and instances which enable
one to distinguish true and false statements, the means by which each is
sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the
acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged of saying what
counts as true. (Foucault 1980a: 131) Foucault argues that, in our
societies, [the dominant regime]{.underline} of truth [is centred on
scientific discourse and]{.underline} the [institutions]{.underline}
that support this. [[The specific intellectual has]{.underline}]{.mark}
a particular class position, as Gramsci noted too, and particular
conditions of work, but more than that, [a particular [connection to the
way]{.mark} that the politics of [truth works.]{.mark} This
gives]{.underline} such an intellectual [the possibility of struggle at
the level of the regime of truth]{.underline}. Of course, [\'this regime
is]{.underline} not merely ideological or superstructural; it was [a
condition of the formation and development of capitalism\']{.underline}
(Foucault 1980a: 133), which means that [[interventions that
challenge]{.mark} the regime of [truth **constitute a challenge to the
hegemony of the**]{.mark} **social and economic [system with which it is
bound up]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** It is in this context of a
particular, scientific regime of truth and the role of the intellectual
that I want to discuss the ways in which the academic search for
\'causes\' and \'solutions\' to the Northern Ireland conflict operates,
and how this mode of working can prohibit change. [The role of [the
intellectual]{.mark}]{.underline}, as both Gramsci and Foucault have
argued, [[can be **central to change and
contestation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it can also be part of the
structures that prohibit change and keep existing structures and
problematisations in place. I suggest that [the]{.underline} particular
form of [intellectual]{.underline} work [that identifies \'problems\'
and]{.underline} then [proposes \'solutions\']{.underline} is
problematic. It ultimately reinforces or [***reproduces*** certain ways
of ***thinking*** and ***conceals*** the way that [***identifying
something as a problem in the first place*** ***is***]{.mark} ***already
[to take a]{.mark} particular [stance]{.mark}***]{.underline} in
relation to it. I argue that [[the]{.underline}
[alternative]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in the case of
violence]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} to
engage in [[intellectual]{.mark} [activity that ***brings to
light***]{.mark} struggles hidden in]{.underline} detailed
[historical]{.underline} records [or [localised
knowledges]{.mark}]{.underline} - an activity that Foucault calls
genealogy - [***[and emphasises the]{.mark} necessity for a gradual
[remaking of the world]{.mark}***, not through narrative accounts that
regularise and normalise history in terms of cause and effect, but
through a ***slow re-building, brick by brick***]{.underline}***.***
Cause and Solution The question the present volume addresses
specifically is whether a search for causes and solutions is in some way
constitutive of the very problems that analysis purports to attempt to
resolve. There are two ways of interpreting this question. First, it can
be read as asking whether what academics propose as \'causes\' of the
conflict originate *from the analysis of* the conflict (in other words,
were the causes there already, waiting to be identified and analysed),
or whether they come from the imagination of academics and only later
are found in the *\'real world\'* of the conflict. In other words, did
the theorising of academics predispose them to find certain things \'out
there\' in the \'real world\' and thus prompt behaviour of a type that
then made the real world appear to be as the academics had proposed? To
put it simply, is academic theorising a self-fulfilling prophecy? Does
the way we see the world, influenced at least in part by academic
analyses, affect how we act in the world and thus produce a world that
resembles academic theorisations? These questions, although interesting,
are still framed within a very particular way of thinking, one that
operates with an assumed separation between \'thinking\' and \'the
world\'. They raise the question of whether intellectual analysis in the
social world can be seen as independent or whether it should rather be
regarded as constitutive of the world. There is a strong argument for
the latter position. Adopting this view brings into question a
scientific regime of truth, to the extent to which such a regime depends
on notions of objectivity. However, alongside this concern there is
another. To what extent does the way in which \'problems\' like conflict
are approached have a specific impact too? Is it just the question of
objectivity that is problematic here? Or is the search for causes and
solutions itself a very particular form of academic analysis of
conflict, and one that has particular implications? [The idea that
conflicts have causes, and that if we]{.underline} could
[understand]{.underline} what those [causes]{.underline} were [we could
remove them and put an end to conflict, reflects a]{.underline}
specifically [**modernist, Western, academic approach**, where answers
are sought in **technical terms**]{.underline}. The point is that even
if it is accepted that theories in some sense constitute the world, it
is still often tacitly assumed that that \'problems\' exist \'out
there\': solutions may be problematic in terms of objectivity or the
impossibility of separating theory from practice, but often the
existence of problems themselves (conflict, famine) to which
\'solutions\' are sought is not questioned. It might be useful to
examine this further. The literature on famines is interesting in this
regard. Much of it is centred on the idea that famines have causes, and
that we can \'end\' famines through scientific, social scientific or
economic research. The assumption is that if we can find out what the
causes of famines are then hopefully we can remove them. Early accounts
that constitute \'famine\' as an object of study in relation to
\'population\' - Malthusian accounts - regard famine as an almost
inevitable consequence of population growth. If human populations expand
(it is taken for granted in these accounts that they will), then the
size of the population will at some stage outstrip the growth in food
production, which takes place, according to these accounts, at a slower
pace (Malthus 1992). Famines will then occur that will bring population
and food supply in line again. Arguments like this in terms of
population growth and resources have been made in relation to conflict
and genocide as well as famine (Uvin 2001). They are similar to views
that see famines as the consequence of environmental degradation or
climatic factors. There are two problems with these accounts. First,
they set to one side the way in which \'famine\' as we think of it now
is produced as an object of study at a particular historical point: this
is no longer questioned (Edkins 2000). In the accounts discussed above,
there is an assumption that famines are a \'natural\' phenomenon. This
way of looking at famines has been disputed for some time, and the view
that famines are \'man-made\' strongly argued (George 1976). However,
even among those who want to emphasise political, structural or economic
causes rather than climatic or environmental ones, there remains a sense
that \'famine\' is an appropriate object of analysis, and that the
\'causes\' of famine can be understood in terms of scientific, social
scientific or economic \'laws\'. Secondly, there is an assumption that
famines take place because of a technical failure: they happen because
of a breakdown of agricultural systems, or a failure of social support
systems, or a problem with economic resources (Edkins 1996). If we can
find out what the cause of this failure is then we can act to put it
right. However, famine is not something that just happens: in many cases
it is not a failure, but rather a process of exploitation (Ramgasami
1985) or even, in some cases, a deliberate act akin to a genocide (De
Waal 1997; Edkins 2002). It is also a process with beneficiaries as well
as victims: while some starve, others make profits because of increased
prices of foodstuffs, or by taking the land of those who emigrate, for
example (Keen 1994). By treating it as a phenomenon that has \'causes\'
we are taking out the politics involved. Famines are not just things
that happen because the rain fails or because the potato becomes
diseased. They are more complex, and more political, than that. They
happen because particular people take particular forms of action - when
they could do otherwise. What the way of thinking I have described does
is constitute famines as events that have causes, and that most usually
can be seen as the failure or breakdown of an otherwise benign system.
They close off the possibility of seeing famines as events, like
genocide for example, that involve the particular actions or inactions
of certain people, people who could in some instances at least be held
responsible for what happens. It does not recognise that there will be
those who will resist any attempt to put in place \'solutions\' that
propose such things as welfare systems to cushion the poor in bad times
or aid provided in such a way that it cannot be exploited by the parties
to a conflict. It is assumed that everyone is behind the effort to make
sure that famines do not take place, and that all that is missing is the
know-how to do this. It forgets that very many people benefit in a wide
variety of ways from the system as it stands, which is one that could be
seen as effectively *producing* famines: famines are arguably the
product *of the system* rather than of its failure. [[Thinking in terms
of \'causes\' and \'solutions\']{.underline}]{.mark}, then, is an
approach that in the case of famines **[makes it impossible to see
certain aspects]{.underline}** of the situation: **[it [makes the
politics of what is going on *invisible*]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
then means that [the search]{.underline} for \'causes\' or \'solutions\'
[is more than just constitutive]{.underline} of the reality it aims to
reflect: **[[this approach is complicit in perpetuating the]{.mark} very
[thing it seeks to \'end\']{.mark}]{.underline}**. Seeing famine as a
failure or a breakdown limits the questions we ask. **[[We need to look
at]{.mark} the politics *of it*]{.underline}**, not just [treat\[ing\]
it as a problem]{.underline}, a technical malfunction of an otherwise
benign system. Treating it in this way **[enables the economy of
oppressions]{.underline}** and benefits that surrounds it ***[to
continue]{.underline}***. We need to consider the possibility that
famines happen because the social and political system in which they are
embedded is working too well rather than because it has failed. The same
sort of argument applies, I would want to suggest, to the case of
conflict. An abstract study of conflict in terms of cause and solution
can be similarly problematic. The Local and the Global If the search for
causes and solutions can be counterproductive, what do we do? One
possibility, as has been mentioned in the case of famines, is [**to pay
attention not to *causes* but to *[functions]{.mark}***: we should look
not at what causes conflict, but]{.underline} what does a particular
conflict dod? Who does it benefit and how? [How does constituting the
\'conflict\' as an object of study produce certain effects]{.underline}?
This demands a focus not on \'conflict\' in *general* but on the
*local*: the specific detail of particular instances.

#### Dissensus is able to radically reframe our demands and open up space for subjugated epistemologies---the alternative is the only chance to reclaim the political sphere from elites

**[[The political]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore, **[[is not about
expressing demands to the elites to rectify inequalities or
unfreedoms]{.underline}]{.mark}**, exemplified by the demands of many
activists and others who are choreographing resistance to the police
order, **[but]{.underline}**, in contrast, **[it is the demand to be
counted, named, and recognized as part of the police order. It is the
articulation of voice that demands its place in the spaces of the police
order]{.underline}**: it appears, for example, when undocumented workers
shout "we are here, therefore we are from here" and demand their place
within the socio-political edifice. These are the evental time-spaces
from where a proper political sequence may unfold. **[The political is
about the unconditional enunciation of the right to
égaliberté]{.underline}**, the right to the polis; **[the political is
thus premised on the unconditionality of equality in an oligarchic
police arrangement that has always already 'wronged' the very condition
of equality and liberty]{.underline}**. This is of course what Rancière
also refers as the scandal of democracy that maintains a singular
presence, yet is radically split into two processes: the oligarchic
police process on the one hand and the principle of equality expressed
through the process of emanciptation on the other (Rancière 1998**[[).
Democratic politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore**[, [are radically
anti-utopian;]{.mark} they are not about fighting for a utopian future,
but are precisely about bringing into being, spatialising, what is
already promised by the very principle upon which the democratic
political is constituted,]{.underline}** i.e. equality. If the
supervision of places and functions is defined as the 'police', "**[a
proper political sequence begins, then, when this supervision is
interrupted so as to allow a properly anarchic disruption of function
and place, a sweeping de-classification of speech. The democratic voice
is the voice of those who reject the prevailing social distribution of
roles, who refuse the way a society shares out power and
authority"]{.underline}**. (Hallward 2003b: 192[). **[The proper
political act]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** Rancière
maintains[**[, is the voice of "floating subjects that deregulate all
respresentations of places and
portions.]{.underline}**"(]{.mark}Rancière 1998: 99-100): "In the end
everything in politics turns on the distribution of spaces. What are
these places? How do they function? Why are they there? Who can occupy
them? For me, political action always acts upon the social as the
litigious distribution of places and roles. It is always a matter of
knowing who is qualified to say what a particular place is and what is
done to it." (Rancière 2003a: 201) **[[The political arises when the
given order of things is questioned]{.underline}]{.mark}**; **[[when
those whose voice is only recognized as noise by the policy order claim
their right to speak, acquire speech, and produce]{.mark} the
[spatiality]{.mark} that permits and sustains this right]{.underline}**.
As such, **[it [disrupts the order of being,]{.mark} exposes the
constituent antagonisms[, voids and excesses that constitute the police
order]{.mark}, and tests the principle of equality.]{.underline}**
**[[The political]{.mark},]{.underline}** therefore, [**[always operates
from a certain minimal distance from the State/the
police]{.underline}**1. **[Politics]{.underline}**]{.mark} proper, then,
[i**[s the confrontation of the political with the police
order,]{.underline}**]{.mark} when the principle of equality confronts a
wrong instituted through the police order. It appears thus when the
police order is dislocated, transgressed, "when the natural order of
domination is interrupted by the institution of a part of those who have
no part" (Rancière 1998: 11): "\[p\]olitics in general ... is about the
visibilities of places and abilities of the body in these places, about
the partition of public and private spaces, about the very configuration
of the visible and the relation of the visible to what can be said about
it. All this is what I call the partition of the sensible" (Rancière
2003b: 3). **[[A proper]{.mark} [democratic political
sequence,]{.mark}]{.underline}** therefore, **[is [not one that seeks
justice and equality through governmental
procedures]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the basis of sociologically defined
injustices or inequalities, **[but rather starts from the paradigmatic
condition of equality or égaliberté, one that is 'wronged' by the police
order]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[a proper politics is one that
asserts the principle of equality and justice as its original principle,
not as a normative goal; democratic politics is,]{.underline}**
therefore, **[always disruptive and transformative:]{.underline}**
"Political activity is whatever shifts a body from the place assigned to
it or changes a place's destination. It makes visible what had no
business being seen, and makes heard a discourse where once there was
only place for noise; it makes understood as discourse what was once
only heard as noise" (Rancière 1998: 30). Politics acts on the police
(Rancière 1998: 33) and "... revolves around what is seen and what can
be said about it, around who has the ability to see and the talent to
speak, around the properties of spaces and the possibilities of time"
(Rancière 2006b: 13). The space of the political is to "disturb this
arrangement \[the police\] by supplementing it with a part of the
no-part identified with the community as a whole" (Rancière 2001), it is
a particular that stands for the whole of the community and aspires
towards universalisation. The space of the political is therefore always
specific, concrete, particular, but stands as the metaphorical
condensation of the universal. And of course, **[politics is about the
production of spaces and the recognition of the principle of dissensus
as the proper base for politics]{.underline}**. As Rancière attests:
"\[t\]he principle function of politics is the configuration of its
proper space. It is to disclose the world of its subjects and its
operations. The essence of politics is the manifestation of dissensus,
as the presence of two worlds in on" (Rancière 2001: Thesis 8); it
occurs when there is a place and a way for the meeting of the police
process with the process of equality (Rancière 1998: 30). **[Politics
has]{.underline}**, therefore, **[no foundational place or
location:]{.underline}** **["Politics 'takes place' in the space of the
police, by rephrasing and restaging social issues, police problems and
so on]{.underline}**", **[it is the disruption of the police
order]{.underline}** (Rancière 2003c: 7). It can **[arise anywhere and
everywhere. "\[S\]pace becomes political in that it ... becomes an
integral element of the interruption of the 'natural']{.underline}**
(or, better yet, naturalized**[) order of domination through the
constitution of a place of encounter by those that have no part in that
order]{.underline}**. **[The political,]{.underline}** in this account,
**[is signaled by this encounter as a moment of
interruption,]{.underline}** and not by the mere presence of power
relations and competing interests" (Dikeç 2005: 172). The political
understood in above terms rejects a naturalization of the political,
signals that a political 'passage à l'acte' does not rely on expert
knowledge and administration (the partition of the sensible), but on a
disruption of the field of vision and of the distribution of functions
and spaces on the basis of the principle of equality. With Alain Badiou,
Rancière shares the view that the political event is rare and unusual;
they are far from believing that 'everything is political', the clarion
call of 1970s style progressive movements. While the political event
might arise anywhere and everywhere, the political sequence is unusual,
eventual, not predictable, and, above all, disruptive. Politics, i.e.
the struggle of those who have no name and no voice to enter the space
of the police, the contested borderline zone between the political and
the police, is an even rarer moment, when those who are part of the
situation but not part of the state of the situation become part of the
state. This view of the political as a space of dissensus, for
enunciating difference and for negotiating conflict, stands in sharp
contrast to the consolidating consensual 'post- politics' of
contemporary neo-liberal 'good' governance. Of course, it also begs the
question as to what to do. **[How to reclaim the
political]{.underline}**, as discussed above, **[from the debris of
consensual autocratic post-political post-democracy?]{.underline}**
Claiming the Democratic Polis The notion of the political articulated in
this paper centers on division, conflict, and polemic (Valentine 2005),
accepts the constitutive antagonisms that split 'the people', that
traverse the myth of the One, the singular, and rejects the myth of an
archae-political possibility of an organic, sutured, unfractured
community, the possibility of a community one with itself. Therefore,
democracy always operates against pacification, acknowledges social
disruption, and disturbs the management of consensus and 'stability'. As
Peter Hallward, echoing Rancière and Badiou, argues: "\[t\]he concern of
democracy is not with the formulation of agreement or the preservation
of order but with the invention of new and hitherto unauthorised modes
of disaggregation, disagreement and disorder" (Hallward 2005: 34-35). A
political truth procedure, for Badiou, is initiated when in the name of
equality fidelity to an event is declared, a fidelity that, although
always particular, aspires to become public, to universalize. It is a
wager on the truth of the egalitarian political sequence, unleashed by a
declaration of fidelity to the communist hypothesis (Badiou 2008), a
truth that can be only verified ex-post. Preferred examples of Badiou
and Žižek are Robespierre, Lenin, or Mao in their declaration of
fidelity to the procedure of communist truth in the revolutionary event.
Badiou defines 'le passage à l'acte' as an intervention in the state of
the situation that transforms and transgresses the symbolic orders of
the existing condition and marks a shift from the old to a new
situation, one that cannot any longer be thought of in terms of the old
symbolic framings. Žižek insists that such a political act does not
start 'from the art of the possible, but from the art of the impossible'
(Žižek 1999b). **[Proper politics is thus about enunciating demands that
lie beyond the symbolic order of the police; demands that cannot be
symbolized within the frame of reference of the police and, therefore,
would necessitate a transformation in and of the police to permit
symbolization to occur.]{.underline}** Yet, **[these are demands that
are eminently sensible and feasible]{.underline}** when the frame of the
symbolic order is shifted, **[when the parallax gap between what
is]{.underline}** (the constituted symbolic order of the police) **[and
what can be]{.underline}** (the reconstituted symbolic order made
possible through a shift in vantage points, one that starts from the
partisan universalizing principle of equality). This is the actual
political process through which those that have no part claim their
place within the symbolic edifice of the police, become part of the
state of the situation. This is where the impossible egalitarian demands
are formulated and fought for that express and transgress the partition
of the sensible, that require a transformation of socio-physical space
and the institution of a radically different partition of the sensible.
**[[It is the sort of demands that 'restructure the entire social
space']{.underline}]{.mark}** (Žižek 1999b: 208**[[), that are
impossible to be symbolized within the existing police
order]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The form of politicization predicated upon
universalizing egalibertarian demands cuts directly against the radical
politics that characterize so much of the current forms and
theorizations of resistance. **[Rather than embracing the multitude of
singularities and the plurality of possible modes of becoming, this
approach starts from the suturing attempts of the existing police order
and its associated social relations; rather than reveling in the
immanence of imperial transformation, an immanence to which there is no
outside]{.underline}** (à la Hardt and Negri**[), rather than the
micropolitics of dispersed resistances, alternative practices, and
affects]{.underline}** (à la Holloway or Critchley), the view explored
in this contribution foregrounds division and exclusion and emphases the
'passage to the act' through a political truth procedure that
necessitates taking sides (see (Dean 2006: 115). **[[Politics understood
as rituals of resistance is]{.mark},]{.underline}** according to Zizek,
**[[doomed to fail politically:]{.underline}]{.mark}** "Radical
political practices itself is conceived as an unending process which can
destabilize, displace, and so on, the power structure, without ever
being able to undermine it effectively -- the ultimate goal of radical
politics is ultimately to displace the limit of social exclusions,
empowering the excluded agents (sexual and ethnic minorities) by
creating marginal spaces in which they can articulate and question their
identity" (Žižek 2002b: 101). T**[he problem with such tactics is not
only that they leave the symbolic order intact and at best 'tickle' the
police order, they are actually conducive to the flows of global capital
and can be fully subsumed within it]{.underline}**. As Žižek puts it,
"these practices of performative reconfiguration/displacement ultimately
support what they intend to subvert, since the very field of such
'transgressions' are already taken into account, even engendered by the
hegemomic form" (Žižek 1999b: 264). In contrast, as Alain Badiou (Badiou
2005b) argues, a new radical politics requires formulating and enrolling
new great fictions that create real possibilities for constructing
different egalibertarian socio-environmental or geographical futures.
This requires foregrounding and naming different socio-environmental
futures, making the new and impossible enter the realm of politics and
of democracy on the basis of the very promise of democracy (egaliberty),
but which the oligarchic hatred of democracy systematically undermines
or disrupts, and recognizing conflict, difference, and struggle over the
naming and trajectories of these futures. Politics consists in a "series
of actions that reconfigure the space where parties, parts, or lack of
any parts have been defined (Rancière 1998: 30)" cited in (Dikeç 2005:
181-182)". Proper egalitarian democracy is "the symbolic institution of
the political in the form of the power of those who are not entitled to
exercise power -- a rupture in the order of legitimacy and domination.
It is the paradoxical power of those who do not count: the count of the
'unaccounted for'" (Rancière 2000c: 124). Dissensus is the proper name
of egalitarian politics: "The notion of dissensus thus means the
following: politics is comprised of a surplus of subjects that
introduce, within the saturated order of the police, a surplus of
objects. These subjects do not have the consistency of coherent social
groups united by a common property or a common birth, etc. They exist
entirely within the act, and their actions are manifestations of a
dissensus; that is, the making contentious of the givens of a particular
situation. The subjects of politics make visible that which is not
perceivable, that which, under the optics of a given perceptive field,
did not possess a raison d'être, that which did not have a name ....
This ... constitutes the ground for political action: certain subjects
that do not count create a common polemical scene where they put into
contention the objective status of what is 'given' and impose an
examination and discussion of those things that were not 'visible', that
were not accounted for previously" (Rancière 2000c: 124-125) Therefore,
**[the political act]{.underline}** (intervention) proper
**[is]{.underline}** "not simply something that works well within the
framework of existing relations, but **[something that changes the very
framework that determines how things work]{.underline}** .... **[it
changes the very parameters of what is considered 'possible' in the
existing constellation]{.underline}** (emphasis in original)" (Žižek
1999b: 199). The political becomes for Žižek and Rancière the space of
litigation (Žižek 1998), the space for those who are not-All, who are
uncounted and unnamed, not part of the 'police' (symbolic or state)
order. **[A true political space is always a space of contestation for
those who have no name or no place.]{.underline}** This is where the
impossible egalitarian demands are formulated and fought for that
express and transgress the partition of the sensible, demands that
presupposes or requires a transformation of socio-physical space. Such
egalitarian-democratic demands, scandalous in the representation order
of the police yet eminently realizable, are like those formulated in the
last chapter of the Communist Manifesto (universal and free education,
universal and free care for the elderly, universal and equitable voting
rights, universal and free health care, collective organization of
(produced) natures). When these demands were formulated in 1848, they
were scandalous, deeply disruptive and rejected out of hand as
impossible by the police order. Yet, four of these five demands were
realized in one form or another in most of Western Europe during the
20th century: the passion for the real (Badiou 2007) embodied by these
demands fuelled the passage to the act that instituted them. That
constitutes, for Badiou or Ranciere, a proper political sequence, and
one that can be thought and practiced irrespective of any substantive
social theorization -- it is the political in itself at work. Of course,
the current neo-liberal police order has already substantially eroded
these democratic gains while traversing the symbolic order, one that now
sees these demands again as scandalous and impossible. These are today
among the key arenas where the principle of freedom and equality is
perverted and undermined, where the scandal of democracy erupts most
violently. Another example of such political sequence erupted when, in
1981, Solidarnosc's demands for better working conditions on the Gdansk
shipyards translated into the universal demands for political rights
against the oligarchic bureaucratic order of state capitalism and their
apparatchiks in Poland; when the latter acknowledged the demands of the
activists, their police order's symbolic edifice and constituted order
crumbled and revealed the empty locus of power. They launched a proper
political sequence that would overturn the symbolic order and the
distribution of functions and places associated with it. Or when civil
society groups took to the streets of East Germany and demanded
different rights, it started a sequence that would transform existing
authoritarian state forms. Their subsequent history of course also
signaled their accelerated incorporation into a post-political European
order as the opened dissensual political space soon closed down again.
It is the sort of demand expressed when illegal and other immigrants in
Europe or the US claim that 'we are here, therefore we are from here'.
The illegal immigrant already foreshadows of course the idealized
neoliberal subject, the one without political inscription, without
papers (and therefore no rights); the illegal immigrant already stands
in as the subject neoliberalisation seeks to universalize, the one
without papers, homo sacer, and who, consequently, has no other choice
than to sell him- or herself to the highest bidder: "Nowadays, when the
welfare state is gone, this separation between citizens and non-citizens
still remains, but with an additional paradox that non citizens
represent the avant-garde within the neo-liberal project, because they
are indeed positioned within the labor force market without any kind of
social rights or state protection. Thus, if we examine this problem in
such a way, the sanspapiers and the erased are the avant-garde form of
sociality which would prevail if the neo- liberal concept is to be fully
realized, if it would not be important anymore if someone is a citizen

6.1 (2006) 239-267, MUSE, JS)

In its current terror wars, **[[the U.S. government has repeatedly
characterized the threat as an external one]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
enemy comes from without to destroy the homeland. \"**[They\" hate
\"Us\" (and our freedom). They will stop at nothing to
destroy]{.underline}** us (National Security Strategy 2002). Upon closer
examination, however, we find that---just as the borders and identities
that are supposed to demarcate in from out are porous and
shifting---**[those who comprise the enemy do not necessarily come from
without]{.underline}**. **[They are,]{.underline}** however,
**[increasingly rendered \"other\" and situated on the
outside]{.underline}**, figuratively and sometimes literally. At times,
however, this process of defining and rendering those who attack us as
enemy outsiders comes into conflict with the racialized concept of the
insider. No one disputes that the bombings of the federal building in
Oklahoma City and the Olympic plaza in Atlanta, the actions of the
unabomber, or the mailing of anthrax-laden letters to government offices
were terrorist attacks. But these were all, apparently, perpetrated by
white \[End Page 251\] men---not only citizens but classic Americans
with no foreign ties to blame. For the most part, this incongruity has
been allowed to slip away quietly; somehow, these events are no longer
referenced in the context of the War on Terror. Timothy McVeigh (Jones
and Gideon 1998), Eric Rudolf (Burkoff 2004, 650-51), and Ted Kaczynski
(Mello 2000) have been prosecuted and convicted under normal criminal
laws and procedures, and the identified anthrax suspect seems to be
under investigation indefinitely (Greenhouse 2002).15 Even John Walker
Lindh, a white U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan while allegedly
fighting for the Taliban, was treated as an internal criminal rather
than an outside terrorist. He was taken by the military to Alexandria,
Virginia, turned over to civil authorities, and charged with conspiring
to kill Americans. As White House spokesman Ari Fleischer announced,
\"the great strength of America is he will now have his day in court\"
(Seelye 2002; Cole 2002). In fact, Lindh soon appeared in a civilian
criminal court where, represented by counsel and supported by his
family, he pled guilty to reduced charges (United States v. Lindh). Yet
in other cases, U.S. citizens suspected of similar crimes have not been
afforded such constitutionally guaranteed due process. Instead, they
have been unilaterally declared to be outsiders---enemy combatants---and
that designation, which has no intrinsic legal meaning, has been used to
deny them virtually all the rights supposedly attached to citizenship.
Yaser Esam Hamdi, like Lindh, was taken prisoner in Afghanistan and was
apparently on his way to Guantánamo when it was discovered that he was a
U.S. citizen of Middle Eastern descent, born in Louisiana. He was then
placed in a naval brig in Norfolk, Virginia, and held incommunicado for
nearly three years. A petition for habeas corpus was filed on his
behalf, and in June 2004, the Supreme Court held that \"a
citizen-detainee seeking to challenge his classification as an enemy
combatant must receive notice of the factual basis for his
classification, and a fair opportunity to rebut the Government\'s
factual assertions before a neutral decision maker\" (See Hamdi v.
Rumsfeld, 533). The Court did not require that the \"neutral decision
maker\" be a federal court or that constitutional protections normally
pertaining to criminal proceedings be extended to such
\"citizen-detainees.\"16 \[End Page 252\] Rather than providing Hamdi
with even minimal due process, the government chose to remove him beyond
any border penetrable by the U.S. Supreme Court. As reported by the New
York Times, \"Yaser E. Hamdi, an American citizen captured in
Afghanistan and once deemed so dangerous that the American military held
him incommunicado for more than two years as an enemy combatant, will be
freed and allowed to return to Saudi Arabia. . . .\" (Lichtblau 2004,
A1).17 In light of its consistent history of attempting to deport
politically undesirable aliens on the basis of secret evidence (Akram
1999), the government\'s desire to deport Hamdi rather than give him a
hearing is not particularly surprising. In Hamdi\'s case, however, his
citizenship complicated the government\'s ability to classify him as a
politically undesirable alien. As law professor Leti Volpp explains: In
the American imagination, those who appear \"Middle Eastern, Arab, or
Muslim\" may be theoretically entitled to formal rights, but they do not
stand in for or represent the nation. Instead, they are interpellated as
antithetical to the citizen\'s sense of identity. Citizenship in the
form of legal status does not guarantee that they will be constitutive
of the American body politic. In fact, quite the opposite: The
consolidation of American identity takes place against them. (Volpp
2002, 1594) Thus, in return for his release, Hamdi not only had to agree
to deportation to Saudi Arabia but also to renunciation of his U.S.
citizenship (Lichtblau 2004).18 Even more interesting is the case of
Jose Padilla, a Puerto Rican born in Brooklyn and thus, like Lindh and
Hamdi, a U.S. citizen by birth. Unlike Lindh and Hamdi, he was not
captured in combat but was arrested at Chicago\'s O\'Hare Airport on a
material witness warrant (Iijima 2004, 134-38; Newman 2003/2004). Two
days before a scheduled court hearing, he was declared an enemy
combatant and ordered into military custody. Initially held in New York,
he was transferred to a military brig in South Carolina where he remains
nearly four years later. The Supreme Court heard Padilla\'s case but
failed to reach the merits, holding that the case had been filed in the
wrong jurisdiction. Padilla refiled in South Carolina, where \[End Page
253\] the federal district court held that the executive did not have
the inherent power it asserted to detain indefinitely a U.S. citizen,
arrested on U.S. soil, as an enemy combatant. Accordingly, the court
ordered the government to criminally charge Padilla or release him. This
was rapidly reversed, however, by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals,
which in September 2005 held that the government could indefinitely
imprison Padilla without trial based on its assertion that he
\"represents a continuing, present and grave danger to the national
security of the United States\" (Padilla v. Hanft, 388). Padilla, like
his homeland of Puerto Rico, has been declared \"foreign in a domestic
sense,\" and apparently the government \"has the power to keep \[him\],
like a disembodied shade, in an intermediate state of ambiguous
existence for an indefinite period\" (Downes v. Bidwell, 372). But this
travesty should not surprise us. American Indians have long been treated
as enemy combatants even during times of peace.19 Well into the
twentieth century, American Indians were generally required to obtain a
permit from a federal Indian agent---or in some cases the
military---simply to leave the territory to which they had been
assigned. In the 1879 Standing Bear case, a federal court held that a
group of Poncas, sent to a reservation in the Indian Territory of
Oklahoma, who attempted to return to their traditional lands in eastern
South Dakota without permission could be arrested by the army (United
States ex rel. Standing Bear v. Crook; Tibbles 1972). During the 1870s
and 1880s, the U.S. government shipped the entire Chiricahua Apache
population, including not only children, elders, and women but also
those men who had fought for the United States against their renegade
relatives, to the Fort Marion and Fort Pickens military prisons in
Florida. Later sent to the Mt. Vernon Barracks in Alabama, they were
confined in an utterly alien climate until the winter of 1913-1914,
resulting in a death toll of some 40 percent (Leider and Page 1997). It
was not until 1909 that a court formally ruled that American Indians
could not be classified---or treated---as prisoners of war merely
because they were Indians (United States v. By-a-lil-le; Harring 1994,
198-203). And then, of course, there were the nearly 120,000 Japanese
Americans, two-thirds of them U.S. citizens by birth, incarcerated for
years during World War II without any semblance of due process20 on the
basis of military \[End Page 254\] assertions that it was impossible to
tell the loyal Japanese American from the disloyal. In General John L.
DeWitt\'s words, \"The Japanese race is an enemy race and while many
second and third generation Japanese born on United States soil,
possessed of United States citizenship, have become \'Americanized,\'
the racial strains are undiluted\" (Commission on Wartime Relocation and
Internment of Civilians 1997, 66). They were, in other words,
collectively deemed enemy combatants. Notably, the evacuation orders
were directed at \"all persons of Japanese ancestry---alien and
non-alien.\" \"Non-aliens\" were, of course, those \"born on United
States soil\" and \"possessed of United States citizenship,\" but as
\"non-aliens\" rather than \"citizens,\" they could be presumed disloyal
on the basis of race and national origin and incarcerated indefinitely
without trial, indeed without any of the protections guaranteed by the
Bill of Rights (Rostow 1945). Throughout U.S. history, **[any movement
that threatens the status quo has been labeled a threat to the national
security]{.underline}** and, when possible, foreigners are blamed.
**[Un-American,]{.underline}** thus, **[has both a literal and a
figurative dimension.]{.underline}** As early as 1798, Congress passed
the first Alien and Sedition Acts based on the Federalists\' claim that
the Jeffersonians were agents of France attempting to bring the French
Revolution\'s reign of terror to the United States (Curry 1988).
**[Those who fought for the abolition of slavery were deemed
seditious]{.underline}** (Curtis 1997). **[Catholic
immigrants]{.underline}** from southern and eastern Europe **[were
untrustworthy because their primary allegiance was to the
pope]{.underline}**, labor organizing was the work of foreign agitators,
and immigrants were to blame for the popularity of anarchist and
socialist movements in the early 1900s (Zinn 1980, 206-89; Goldstein
2001, 3-101). Those who opposed the war to occupy the Philippines
(1898-1902) and U.S. involvement in the First World War were accused of
sedition and even treason (Goldstein 2001, 103-35; Miller 1982, 77,
156-66). In the 1950s and 1960s, civil rights and anti-war organizations
were routinely labeled communist front groups, and, more generally,
anyone advocating social or political change was deemed a threat to the
national security. As the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (also
known as the Church Committee) reported in the mid-1970s, this practice
was used as an excuse by the FBI and numerous other federal agencies to
engage in thousands of \[End Page 255\] counterintelligence operations
against U.S. citizens, using means that were lawful only when employed
against spies, saboteurs, and other such agents of foreign powers.20 One
of the most significant, and generally overlooked, aspects of the
PATRIOT Act is its legalization of the use of such means previously
employed illegally against U.S. citizens. Thus, for example, Title II
expands the definition of \"foreign intelligence information\" to
include not only information relating to attacks or sabotage by foreign
powers or their agents, but \"information, whether or not concerning a
United States person, with respect to a foreign power or foreign
territory that relates to (i) the national defense or the security of
the United States; or (ii) the conduct of the foreign affairs of the
United States\" (§203\[a\], emphasis added). Thus defined, any
citizen\'s statements on any matter of U.S. foreign policy, including
economic policy, may be deemed \"foreign intelligence information\" and,
as a result, disclosed to virtually any federal law enforcement,
intelligence, immigration, or national security official. In addition to
generally expanding surveillance powers, the Act extends provisions of
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to domestic activities as long
as foreign intelligence is also a purpose, rather than the purpose, of
the investigation. This information can then be used in criminal
prosecutions, eviscerating the Fourth Amendment\'s requirement of
probable cause for searches and seizures, as has already been done in
drug-trafficking, blackmail, and pornography cases (Chemerinsky 2004,
1624-- 27; Lichblau 2003). On numerous fronts, **[the government is
invoking the threat of terrorism to expand dramatically its domestic
criminal law enforcement powers in direct violation of constitutional
guarantees. [Playing upon the fears generated by the specter of an enemy
attacking the homeland from without, the
executive]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[[backed by the Congress and the
judiciary, has thus turned its expanded arsenal of state]{.mark} police
[power]{.mark} toward combating both ordinary crime and political
dissent within the homeland.]{.underline}** In turn, **[those within who
are deemed threats to the status quo are increasingly portrayed as
outsiders]{.underline}**. **[The right to engage in political protest is
characterized as a fundamental American value, but under the PATRIOT
Act, those who violate any federal or state law while engaging in acts
\"dangerous]{.underline}** \[End Page 256\] **[to human life\" that
appear intended to \"influence the policy of a government by
intimidation or coercion\"]{.underline}** can be charged and prosecuted
as \"domestic terrorists\" (§802\[a\]). Under this definition, Dr.
Martin Luther King would have been a domestic terrorist, and it can
certainly be applied today to those who, for instance, fail to obey an
officer\'s order to disperse while blocking an intersection in protest
of the war in Iraq or police brutality or any other government policy.
Acts of civil disobedience that would at most warrant minor misdemeanor
convictions can now result in 15-year prison terms. **[Even when
confronting massive illegality on the part of the government, [we are to
be constrained]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it seems**[[, to symbolic
protests]{.underline}]{.mark}**; in other words, only the least
effective means of dissent will be considered legal. Those who literally
or figuratively venture outside the carefully cordoned-off free speech
zone will be cast as terrorists, outsiders bent on bringing down the
homeland, individuals who are, therefore, the enemy. In a very literal
sense, this has been proposed by the Justice Department in its draft
Domestic Security Act of 2003. Commonly known as PATRIOT II, this
proposed legislation was leaked to the press and, probably because of
widespread public criticism, has not been introduced in its totality.
Several of its provisions, however, have been enacted with little
debate. One proposal, as yet unadopted but illuminating the trajectory
of this War on Terror, would allow for the expatriation of a U.S.
citizen who joins, serves in, or provides material support to a
terrorist organization \"engaged in hostilities against the United
States, its people, or its national security interests\" (§501).
\"Material support,\" \"terrorist organization,\" and \"national
security interests\" are each extremely broadly defined and
\"hostilities\" is left undefined, with the result that this provision
has virtually unlimited potential for rendering U.S. citizens stateless.
They (we?) would, in very concrete terms, become the enemy
without---residing, perhaps, at Guantánamo Bay or in a Saudi prison.
Returning to First Principles **[Beyond the more tangible aspects
underlying the construct of homeland security]{.underline}**---the land,
borders, and people purportedly being protected---**[lies]{.underline}**
\[End Page 257\] **[another dimension]{.underline}**, that of
**[American values.]{.underline}** The **[importance of defending these
values is most frequently invoked when the concrete manifestations of
U.S. policies appear at odds with their stated intent]{.underline}**. In
the current terror wars**[, [the U.S. government justifies its exercise
of unilateral power,]{.mark} its disregard for international law and
institutions]{.underline}**, and its violation of human rights and
humanitarian law both at home and abroad [**[by casting this as a war of
good against evil]{.underline}**.]{.mark} As inimitably put by George W.
Bush shortly after September 11, 2001, \"The people who did this act on
America, and who may be planning further acts, are evil people. They
don\'t represent an ideology, they don\'t represent a legitimate
political group of people. They\'re flat evil. That\'s all they can
think about, is evil\" (Bush 2003b, 22). In this construction, the
United States has an historic responsibility, particularly as the
world\'s sole superpower, to destroy evil because the United States
embodies the core values of the forces of good. Articulated in a variety
of ways, there are three fundamental values at issue here. While
characterized as uniquely American, these values are recognized as the
legitimate aspirations of all peoples. The first is freedom, or liberty:
\"Freedom and fear are at war. The advance of human freedom---the great
achievement of our time, and the great hope of every time---now depends
on us\"(Bush 2003a, 17). The second value is democracy. Although
referenced less frequently in the rhetoric accompanying the domestic War
on Terror, a democratic form of government is recognized as necessary to
the flourishing of human freedom, and the leaders of the \"forces of
evil\" are consistently characterized as dictators and tyrants. As Bush
stated before the U.S. Congress, \"Americans are asking: Why do they
hate us? They hate what we see right here in this chamber---a
democratically elected government. Their leaders are self-appointed.
They hate our freedoms---our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech,
our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other\" (2003a,
14). As noted in the Bush administration\'s National Security Strategy
(2002, n.p.), the rule of law is the third essential component of the
\"nonnegotiable demands of human dignity\" because it guarantees power
will be exercised in a manner consistent with the democratic processes
that in turn protect \[End Page 258\] human freedom. Addressing Congress
in 2001, Bush described America\'s current enemies as \"the heirs of all
the murderous ideologies of the twentieth century\" (Bush 2003a, 14). He
recognized that the alternative to the rule of law is the exercise of
raw power as he continued: \"\[B\]y abandoning every value except the
will to power---they follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and
totalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way, to where it
ends: In history\'s unmarked grave of discarded lies\" (14).
**[Subscribing to the principles of freedom, democracy, and the rule of
law does not,]{.underline}** however, **[necessitate the presumption
that these principles are being defended]{.underline}**. Indeed, all the
evidence indicates that they are being undermined in the name of
homeland security. By every tangible measure, **[the freedom of most
people currently subjected to the exercise of U.S. jurisdiction is being
restricted.]{.underline}** **[[The structural guarantees of democratic
process]{.underline}]{.mark}**, embodied, for example, in the U.S.
Constitution\'s provision for checks and balances, [**[are being
eviscerated by unilateral executive action]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[by
legislation that undermines constitutional guarantees and limits
judicial review, and by the judiciary\'s deference to the political
branches of government]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[the rule of law
is being replaced by the exercise of power, as compliance with not only
the U.S. Constitution but virtually all international law is treated as
optional by those in power]{.underline}**. President Bush was accurate,
of course, in recognizing that the alternative is fascism, Nazism, and
totalitarianism. In The Dual State, written in 1940, Ernst Fraenkel
described the transition in the German government from a normative
state, \"endowed with elaborate powers for safeguarding the legal
order,\" to a prerogative state, defined as a \"governmental system
which exercises unlimited arbitrariness and violence unchecked by any
legal guarantees\" (Stolleis 1998, 8, 193n3). It is this prerogative
state, cloaked in the rhetoric of homeland security, that we now
confront, and the question is what we will do about it. In returning to
first principles, we confront our roots, and in so doing, we must again
confront our primary signifier, Christopher Columbus. The \"la-la-la\"
response described above may appear superficial, but its pervasiveness
indicates that it serves a significant social purpose, an essential
function that is reflected in its underlying logic. Regardless of
whether this \[End Page 259\] psychosocial response of repression and
denial is couched in scholarly or flagrantly anti-intellectual terms,
the subtext is the same: **[We are here now, and it is good. Few of us
have anywhere else to go, and most of us believe that we benefit from
the United States\' disproportionate control of the world\'s wealth,
power, and natural resources. More equity might be preferable,
but]{.underline}** for us, **[the risks of finding out overwhelm the
possible benefits]{.underline}**. **[[Being]{.mark} thus [committed to
the status quo]{.mark}, at least in its most fundamental form, [we will
ordain it as]{.mark} right, natural, [and
inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Adopting this
logic]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[necessarily [entails]{.mark} ignoring or
[denying]{.mark} law, history, and/or contemporary [social
realities]{.mark}]{.underline}**[---**[an
approach]{.underline}**]{.mark}, one might note, **[[that displays the
classic signs of psychosis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But **[most
Americans]{.underline}**, apparently, **[are willing to do so because to
engage in intellectual, ethical, or emotional debates about a foregone
conclusion produces only guilt, not change]{.underline}**. [**[The
temptation]{.underline}**,]{.mark} even here, **[[is to say \"sure,
you\'ve got a theoretical point, but that level of change is unrealistic
and we\'re trying to talk about what\'s happening now]{.mark} in this
so-called War on Terror.\"]{.underline}** **[[This sort of facile
dismissal is]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[at the heart of
what\'s happening now.]{.mark} [We are being told by those in power that
the status quo]{.mark}]{.underline}**---the homeland, with all it
embodies---**[[is]{.mark} right, natural, and [inevitable]{.mark}, and
that it is being threatened by our enemies]{.underline}**. **[It [would
be unrealistic to consider any alternatives when the end has been
predetermined, and it would be unproductive to take seriously the
realities of the death, devastation, and social repression entailed in
its preservation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The truth]{.underline}**,
however, **[is that [our contemporary reality]{.mark} is neither
right,]{.underline}** **[natural, nor inevitable, [and our refusal to
confront it is what allows the American state to continue to consolidate
its power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[using]{.mark} its base of
ill-gotten land and natural resources to extend its economic, political,
and [military might throughout the world and]{.mark}, concomitantly, to
[root out an ever-expanding circle of those deemed to be the enemy
within]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[While [confronting th]{.mark}e widely
[accepted truths]{.mark} that provide the foundation for the status quo
[can appear to be a daunting task]{.mark}, it is important to note that
[the critique]{.mark} summarized in this essay [is an internal]{.mark}
[one---]{.mark}one the framework of]{.underline}** \[End Page 260**[\]
freedom, democracy, and the rule of law not only facilitates but
necessitates]{.underline}**. According to the very legal system upon
which the United States relies for its legitimacy, and upon which it
bases its claim---according to Justice John Marshall---to be \"a
government of laws, and not of men\" (Marbury v. Madison, 163), **[the
claims made by the United States to the homeland are
unsustainable]{.underline}**. The conception of a stable and readily
identifiable border is undermined by the same governmental policies and
practices that rely on this notion. **[The construct of American is used
to justify the protective measures being implemented, but U.S. law,
policy, and practice fail to ensure that the protected class includes
all those over whom the United States exercises
jurisdiction]{.underline}**, making it as indeterminate as the border.
**[Justifications for increasingly repressive state action rest on the
assertion that the enemy is foreign to and in conflict with the American
values being preserved]{.underline}**, **[in direct contradiction to the
fact that those purportedly secured by such measures are]{.underline}**,
with increasing frequency, **[being labeled as the enemy. This attempt
to point out the contradictions inherent in the status quo and its
methods of preserving itself is not a critique based on morals or
ethics, or on natural rights, indigenous law, or even international law,
except to the extent the United States explicitly relies on the
latter]{.underline}**. Such **[analyses]{.underline}** can be, have
been, and **[should be made]{.underline}**. But **[it is not necessary
to do so to see that the current U.S. paradigm is unsustainable on its
own terms]{.underline}**, according to its stated values and its own
laws. And **[this means that far from being unrealistic, [engaging in an
internal critique of any particular practice, policy, or law is quite
feasible]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[Each individual piece can be
readily tied to the larger whole if those of us engaging in the critique
are willing to question our own fundamental assumptions honestly and
confront their implications]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

the Battle of the Story As advertisers learned long ago, people will
only go someplace they have already been in their minds. Imagination
helps us fill in the gaps of possibility between now and then, perhaps
and indeed, maybe and yes. Currently, many of the best storytellers and
image-crafters in our culture are hired guns that sell us an imagined
vision of ourselves, complete with the appropriate brand of carbonated
beverage, designer jeans, or suitably inspirational political candidate.
In a macro sense*, **[[the radical imagination is always engaged in the
battle of the story]{.mark}----[the]{.mark} wide-ranging [fight to frame
the big debates and assign relevance]{.mark} and meaning [to current
events]{.mark} and issues]{.underline}*****[.]{.underline}** Whose
stories will be heard? Which points of view will become accepted as
conventional wisdom? Which will be marginalized and dismissed? Will
collective desire be harnessed for the common good, or hijacked for
private gain? **[These are the real-world implications of narrative
power. If our movements are going to win the battle of the story
against]{.underline}** the systems corporate spectacles and
**[fear-mongering]{.underline}** **[manipulations,]{.underline}** we
need to scale up both our skills and our infrastructure. **[The best way
to build this capacity while keeping it anchored in democratic and
accountable organizing is to grow it from the ground up.
I]{.underline}**n this day and age every activists toolbox and every
social change organizations strategy should include an applied
understanding of narrative power: how [**to analyze dominant culture
stories, reframe issues, and craft effective messages.**]{.underline}
Building the skills of grassroots activists provides an essential
foundation for effective movements but it is only a first step in a
broader strategy for social justice movements to contest the dominant
stories of mass culture. To win major structural changes in society our
movements need to apply the same rigor to the realm of narrative power
analysis as many movements bring to analyzing economic and political
power relations. Already many organizers are crying out for better
mechanisms to help diverse constituencies build shared understandings of
the control mythologies that undermine their efforts. Not only can
common analyses of these obstacles help us amplify and reinforce one
anothers stories, they can also help accelerate the process of building
alliances, identifying collectively held beliefs and setting shared
goals. But the work of distilling different visions into common stories
that serve the range of engaged interests is difficult work that must
confront deeper issues of representation, self-determination and the
tension between short and long-term political goals. To support diverse
constituencies in articulating a common narrative requires
infrastructure: the development of new spaces, processes and
institutions. Fortunately many long-term organizers are thinking along
these ambitious lines and reclaiming the central role of narrative
strategy in movement building. One particularly exciting initiative that
bubbled up at the 2010 United States Social Forum\[vi\] is the Echo
Justice participatory research project. This grassroots effort will
gather information from organizers in the field about how they frame
their struggles and will begin a narrative map of the control myths that
obstruct systemic change in the U.S. The initial pilot project, which is
being shepherded by movement support groups like the Center for Media
Justice\[vii\], Praxis Project\[viii\], Movement Strategy Center\[ix\]
and smartMeme\[x\], used the Social Forums Peoples Movement Assembly
process\[xi\] to instigate deeper conversations about the role of
transformative framing and shared storytelling across our different
struggles and movements. In **[order to have vibrant and effective
movements the radical imagination must not only inform our vision but
also provide an ongoing impetus to innovate our movement
building]{.underline}**. **[Strategy and analysis certainly require
their rational and quantitative components]{.underline}**, *[**but in an
era as volatile as the present our [movements must]{.mark} also [embrace
fluidity, improvisation and paradox]{.mark}**. **The [radical
imagination]{.mark} is the impulse that leaps between unexpected
synapses, bridges between different cultures, and offers a portal

[**we *[must]{.mark}*** remember to **constantly
[reassess]{.mark}**]{.underline} our own assumptions, whether they
govern organizational form, **[[the terms of the

opponents. We must grow movements that are hard-wired to adapt.
Polishing the Chains of the Climate Crisis? As a number of theorists

## 2NC Pessimism Good

#### Embrace failure as a refusal of the extortion of hope and the demand for policy prescriptions to "make things better." Only this can open new avenues for living.

[**Grove 19** \[Jairus, Assoc Prof of International Relations at Univ of
Hawai'i at Manoa, *Savage Ecology: War and Geopolitics at the End of the
World*, p.24-6\]]{.underline}

[Why would I bother with the "night side" of ir theory?47 In part, I
wish to move away from the rationalist fallacy among both defenders and
critics of empire. **[There is a shared belief in the strategic
competence of nations like the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. Even
those most vocally critical often see in the covert operations and vast
military occupations a kind of purpose or conspiracy.** The debate about
empire then becomes about its moral virtue rather than the factual
question of the strategic competence of imperial states. **However, [the
lives of millions annihilated]{.mark} in Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, and
now increasingly throughout the continent of Africa [do not
reflect]{.mark} an amoral [strategic competence.]{.mark} The mass murder
in pursuit of the war on terrorism and its vision of nation-building is
the result of lethal stupidity.**48 In some sense, the investigative
journalism of Jeremy Scahill and Glen Greenwald attributes too much
reason and order to the catastrophic floundering of the American empire.
49 **To see even a dark vision of order in the last thirty years of U.S.
policy is itself a form of optimism. [No one is in control, there is no
conspiracy, and yet the killing continues.]{.mark}** A pessimistic
reading of U.S. empire and the geopolitical history that precedes it is
neither tragedy nor farce. **It is a catastrophic banality lacking in
any and all history, a pile of nonevents so suffocating that we often
hope for a conspiracy, punctuating event, or villain worthy of the scale
of violence.** 50 **For those of us who continually rewatch the reruns
of The Walking Dead** and Jericho on our laptops **in bed, we are
waiting for relief in our privileged but increasingly fragile bubble. I
know I am not the only one who finds respite from the weight of
politics' "cruel optimism" by watching fantasies of cruel pessimism. [A
pessimistic understanding of global politics helps explain how we could
come to a place where there is a sense of relief in watching everything
come to an end.]{.mark}**51 **[Failed IR affirms the power of this kind
of negative thinking as an alternative to the endless rehearsing of
moralizing insights and strategic foresight]{.mark}.** The negative is
not "against" or reacting to something. Rather, it is the affirmation of
a freedom beyond the limits of life and death. That is, **it [is making
a life by continuing to think about the world]{.mark}, even if that
thinking is not recuperative, and [even if nothing we think can save us.
In the face of it all, one celebrates useless thinking, useless
scholarship, and useless forms of life at the very moment we are told to
throw them all under the bus in the name of survival at all
costs.]{.mark}** This is a logic referred to lately as hope and it is as
cruel as it is anxiety inducing. **[Hope is a form of extortion. We are
told that it is our obligation to bear the weight of making things
better]{.mark} while being chided that the failure of our efforts is the
result of not believing in the possibility of real change.** In such an
environment, **[pessimism is]{.mark} often [treated as]{.mark} a form of
[treason, as if only]{.mark}** neoliberals and **[moral degenerates give
up]{.mark}**---or so goes the op-ed's insisting upon the renewed
possibility of redemption. In response to these exhortations, pessimism
offers a historical atheism, both methodologically and morally. The
universe does not bend toward justice. Sometimes the universe bends
toward the indifference of gravity wells and black holes. **[Affirming
negativity]{.mark}**, inspired by Achille Mbembe, **[is grounds for
freedom]{.mark}, even if that freedom or relief is only fleeting and
always insecure.** I am not arrogant enough to think a book can attain
freedom of this sort, but this book is inspired by refusals of critique
as redemption in favor of useless critique and critique for its own
sake. **That the pursuit of knowledge without immediate application is
so thoroughly useless, even profane, is a diagnosis of our current
moment.** The neoliberal assault on the university is evidence of this
condition, as is the current pitch of American politics. **[Our
indifference]{.mark} as intellectuals to maximizing value [has not gone
unnoticed]{.mark}. We are still dangerous, worthy of vilification, of
attack, sabotage, and derision because we fail so decadently.** We are
parasites according to Scott Walker, Donald Trump, and the rest. So be
it. **[We are]{.mark} and shall remain irascible [irritants to a
worldwide assault on thinking that is well underway]{.mark} and facing
few obstacles in other jurisdictions. [What would failed scholarship do?
Learn to die, learn to live, learn to listen, learn to be together, and
learn to be generous.]{.mark} These virtues are useless in that they do
not prevent or manage things. They do not translate into learning
objectives or metrics. [Virtues of this order]{.mark} are selfsame,
nontransferable experiences. They [are meaningful but not
useful.]{.mark}** These are luxurious virtues. **Like grieving or joy,
[they are ends unto themselves. But how will these ideas]{.mark}** seek
extramural grants, contribute to an outcomes-based education system, or
**[become a policy recommendation? They will not, and that is part of
their virtue.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Only pessimism can save us from nihilism -- willing failure is an affirmative act that yields a life worth living

[**Grove 19** \[Jairus, Assoc Prof of International Relations at Univ of
Hawai'i at Manoa, *Savage Ecology: War and Geopolitics at the End of the
World*, p.26-8\]]{.underline}

Even if **[[there is no straight line to where]{.mark} we are and where
[we ought to be]{.mark}]{.underline}**, I think **[[we
should]{.underline}]{.mark}** get over the idea that somehow the U.S.
project of liberal empire is conflicted, or "more right than it is
wrong," or pragmatically preferable to the alternatives. I hope this
book can contribute to the urgent necessity to **[[get out of the way by
reveling in the catastrophic failure]{.underline}]{.mark}** that should
inspire humility but instead seems to embolden too many to seek global
control yet again. **[[Demolition may be an affirmative act if it means
insurgents and others can be better heard]{.mark}. And yet this may fail
too.]{.underline}** If we can accomplish nothing at all, **[[we can at
least]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Ta-Nehisi Coates and other pessimists
have said, **[[refuse to suborn the lie of America any
longer]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Telling the truth, even if it cannot
change the outcome of history, is a certain kind of solace. In Coates's
words, there is a kind of rapture "when you can no longer be lied to,
when you have rejected the dream."52 Saying the truth out loud brings
with it the relief that we are not crazy. **[Things really are as bad as
we think.]{.underline}** If there are those of us who want to break from
this one-hundred- year- old race to be the next Henry Kissinger, then
why do we continue to seek respect in the form of recognizable standards
of excellence? I am not sure where the answer finally lies, but I do
know that professionalization will not save us. To appear as normal and
recognizably rigorous will not be enough to stave off the neoliberal
drive to monetize scholarship, or to demand of us strategically useful
insights. The least we can do in the face of such a battle is to find
comfort in meaningful ideas and the friendships they build rather than
try to perform for those we know are the problem. Some will ask, who is
this "we" or is that "they"---where is your evidence? More will know
exactly what I am talking about. The virtues I seek are oriented toward
an academy of refuge, a place we can still live, no matter how dire the
conditions of the university and the classroom. It is not the think
tank, boardroom, or command center. We are, those of us who wish to be
included, the last of the philosophers, the last of the lovers of
knowledge, the deviants who should revel in what Harney and Moten have
called the undercommons.53 In one of his final lectures, Bataille speaks
of the remnants of a different human species, something not quite so
doomed, something that wasted its newly discovered consciousness and
tool-being on the art that still marks the walls of prehistoric caves.54
This lingering minor or vestigial heritage is philosophy's beginning.
Philosophy survives war, atrocity, famine, and crusades. **[Thinking
matters in a very unusual way. Thinking is not power or emancipation.
Thinking matters for a sense of belonging to the world, and for
believing in the fecundity of the world despite evidence to the
contrary.]{.underline}** How do you get all this from pessimism, from
failure? Because **[[willing failure is a temptation, a lure to think
otherwise, to think dangerous thoughts. Pessimism is a threat to
indifferentism and nihilism]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the sense of the
phenomenon of Donald Trump. **[[Pessimism is a provocation and an enemy
of skepticism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly of the metaphysical
variety. **[It is not redemption from these afflictions, but [in
pessimism there is solace in the real.]{.mark}]{.underline}** To put it
another way, **[to study the world as it is means to care for
it.]{.underline}** The exhortation that our care or interest should be
contingent on how useful the world is and how much of it conforms to our
designs is as much opposed to care as it is to empiricism. We can study
airports, poetry, endurance races, borders, bombs, plastic, and warfare,
and find them all in the world. **[To consider the depth of their
existence can be [an invitation to the world rather than a prelude to
another policy report. One cannot make a successful political career out
of such pursuits, but you might be able to make a life out of it, a life
worth repeating even if nothing else happens.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

## 2NC Accept Death

#### Stop trying to survive, start trying to perish better

[**Grove 19** \[Jairus, Assoc Prof of International Relations at Univ of
Hawai'i at Manoa, *Savage Ecology: War and Geopolitics at the End of the
World*, p.237-8\]]{.underline}

So why study apocalypses? In part because we can learn a lot about the
Earthling condition from how that condition has and will be punctuated
by events far beyond our control.22 **[We live in a world sensitive to
perturbation]{.underline}**, prone to turbulences of various kinds,
**[and it is out of that noise that creativity can be
cultivated]{.underline}** even if only by alliance rather than willed
individualism. So to come **[to grips with apocalypses means also to
think about the scales of action and efficacy with which we can
participate while also cultivating attentiveness to what kinds of living
things we want to intervene with and on behalf of.]{.underline}** This
is the mess that we find ourselves in. **[Transformation is possible but
its possibility may be indifferent]{.underline}**, or at least inured,
**[to our existence. This puts the emphasis on how to live and how to
die rather than whether we live or die.]{.underline}** This is, I think,
also present in the cacophony of apocalypticisms. There are minor
strains of what, much more than Kant's sense of enlightenment, we ought
to call maturity. This time it is not the knowledge of our unique
capacity for reason that should be championed and cultivated but the
limited hold we have on this world and just how vulnerable we are to
forces beyond our control. Maturity as humility and tragedy bares the
marks of what many have called the Anthropocene much more than the
particular consequences of sea-level rise in the course of any one human
life. Whether our current trajectory toward climate turbulence succeeds
in mass extinction cannot exclusively cause or prevent the apocalypse
before us. **[The confrontation with the Earth system, its fragility,
and its capricious grip on life will irreversibly change what it is to
be human.]{.underline}** So there must be both concern and sanguinity in
preparing ourselves for what is already happening. We need to find an
immortality, what Whitehead called perishing, worthy of the event of
humanity. What this means is that **[we should not be fighting so hard
to avoid perishing as a species, if that even means something, but
rather we should be trying to perish better.]{.underline}** This is a
dangerous endeavor. For all the reasons Connolly's work has fought so
hard against negative critique and the debilitating stupor of Theodor
Adorno, Giorgio Agamben, and other followers of the dark arts that see
this life as damaged or in need of redemption, **[we have to find a
place to take the catastrophism of the universe seriously while also
following Deleuze's invitation to intensify belief in this
world.]{.underline}**23 This might ask too much of words and ideas.
Connolly warns that catastrophes "shatter the bond of trust in the world
that had tacitly bound you to humanity and the world."24 Or even worse
yet, apocalypses may, as Bataille writes, "conceal a possibility of
enticement."25 I hope that **[we, particularly in the extravagant and
luxurious countries of the world, are reaching a point of saturation in
which apocalypse is becoming so obvious as to no longer paralyze or
entice but to finally provoke.]{.underline}** I suppose we will see.

## 2NC Alternative---AT Cede the Political

#### Their claims are patently-false intellectual blackmail---refusal of their threat enables better politics to emerge. 

[**Brown '5** (Wendy, Professor of Poli Sci, UC Berkeley, Edgework:

On the one hand, **[[critical theory]{.mark} cannot let itself be bound
by political exigency; indeed, it [has]{.mark} something of [an
obligation to refuse]{.mark} such [exigency]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
While there are always decisive choices to be made in the political
realm (whom to vote for, what policies to support or oppose, what action
to take or defer), these very delimitations of choice are often
themselves the material of critical theory. Here we might remind
ourselves that **[[prying apart immediate political constraints from

thinking its wildness]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[beyond the immediate in

[how]{.mark} this degoverning rearticulates critical theory and politics
after disarticulating them; [critical theory comes back to politics

different sense of time. It is also important to remember that **[[the
\"immediate choices\" are just that]{.mark} [and]{.mark} often [last no

the fact that the political conundrums with which this essay opened will

the argument convincing that critical theory threatens the possibility
of holding back the political dark. **[[It is difficult to name a single

[[Critique]{.underline}]{.mark} offers another source of pleasure

this in terms of the concrete project of this book: if part of the
reason the left feels so small and beleaguered today pertains to the
fact that legalism has nearly saturated the entire political culture,
thus making left projects nearly indistinguishable from more mainstream
liberal ones, then critique of the sort this book features enables the
possibility of discerning and reclaiming left projects within
liberalism, thereby connecting with one another those who have a common
concern with certain kinds of political problems, constraints, and
ideals. In this light, [[critique binds to operate as the basis of the

## 2NC AT Perm

#### The perm links harder -- assimilation of the K ensures the victory of security logics. What is needed is ruthless critique that rejects any effort to make security more socially conscious or less exclusionary. Just say no.

[**Neocleous 18** \[Mark, Prof of the Critique of Political Economy at
Brunel Univ, "The bleak rituals of progress; or, if somebody offers you
a socially responsible innovation in security, just say no," in J. Peter
Burgess, *Socially Responsible Innovation in Security*,
p.129-39\]]{.underline}

**[Given the predominance of this trope of security, it is easy to think
that the Left must have some kind of position]{.underline}** here,
**[offering policies or innovations that are somehow meant to be
'socially responsible', which]{.underline}** is the general assumption
underpinning this book. Such policies or innovations tend to be
structured around a number of key principles. The first works with the
concept of balance, arguing that security is important but must be
balanced with something else such as liberty, or privacy, or democracy.
The second approach involves criticizing the 'privatization' of
security, with the implication that security should be distinct from the
realm of the market and the power of corporations. The third approach
starts by pointing to the irrationality that permeates security policy,
such as the fact that more people are killed each year by drowning in
their own bathtubs than by acts of terrorism, and suggests that once we
see through the absurdities of existing security policy, then we will be
able to have a more rational security regime. Finally, a fourth approach
**[suggests that current security policies are too discriminatory and
that we need to move towards a non- discriminatory security
politics]{.underline}** which does not target minority groups in an
exclusionary fashion. **[The problem with these approaches is that they
essentially accept the]{.underline}** message implicit in the Hobbes-
Cameron position about the universal **[desire for security. They
presuppose that what is at stake really is something called 'security'
and that this is achievable if only security policies were better
organized]{.underline}**, had more realistic or sensible targets, **[and
were less discriminatory]{.underline}** and less subject to the
corporate interests working in the security field. In other words,
**[they presuppose that security really is a universal good that could
be achieved if the right]{.underline}** ('socially responsible')
**[policies were in place.]{.underline}** **[The problem is that once
one makes these presumptions, security will always win.]{.underline}**
Understanding security's imperative to win requires a grasp of security
as the leitmotif of bourgeois modernity. It requires understanding that
**[security can never be disconnected from the powers of war and police
to which it belongs, and therefore never disconnected from capital which
operates with and through these powers.]{.underline}** It requires an
understanding of security not as a universal value but **[as a mechanism
of domination deployed by state and capital, and that this deployment of
security is part and parcel of the wider politics of fear which
underpins bourgeois modernity.]{.underline}** Far from being something
that could ever be genuinely achieved, security exists for the
opportunities it offers to get things done in its name. **[Security is a
mechanism to mobilize, discipline and punish.]{.underline}** In other
words, security is a power for the fabrication of social order
(Neocleous, 2000). This power lies partly in the fact that in a so-
called 'age of rights', security is often presented to us as the most
fundamental of all rights. According to the United Nations, the
fundamental rights of all human beings are 'life, liberty and security'.
This claim repeats the revolutionary discourse of rights in the
eighteenth century, and one thinker who noticed the implications of such
a claim was Marx. In late 1843 in an exchange with Bruno Bauer over 'the
Jewish question', Marx runs through the various declarations of the
rights of man announced by various states in the late eighteenth
century, along with the constitutions which tended to follow such
declarations. Marx points out that the rights in question, though
revolutionary in some (liberal) ways, are still nonetheless the rights
of a member of bourgeois society, 'of egoistic man, of man separated
from other men and from the community'. 'Let us hear what the most
radical Constitution, the Constitution of 1793, has to say', he
suggests, and then notes Article 2 of that Constitution: 'These rights,
etc., (the natural and imprescriptible rights) are: equality, liberty,
security, property'. Marx works through these ideas. Liberty, for
example, is 'the power which man has to do everything that does not harm
the rights of others', according to one Declaration, or 'being able to
do everything which does not harm others', in another. Liberty is thus
'the right to do everything that harms no one else'. J. S. Mill would
later confirm this in his articulation of the 'harm principle' in On
Liberty, but Marx treats it as nothing less than the 'right of ...
separation, the right of the restricted individual, withdrawn into
himself '. The practical application of this right to liberty is man's
right to private property, Marx notes, 'the right to enjoy one's
property and to dispose of it at one's discretion ... without regard to
other men, independently of society'. This 'right of self- interest ...
makes every man see in other men not the realization of his own freedom,
but the barrier to it'. Such observations essentially launch Marx's
critique of both rights discourses through the rest of his work, but
note what he says about security at this moment. On the one hand, the
rights discourse is the realization of equality, which is nothing but
the equality in which each person is regarded as such a self- sufficient
monad. It is also, on the other hand, the raison d'être of security.
Marx cites Article 8 of the French Constitution of 1793 -- 'security
consists in the protection afforded by society to each of its members
for the preservation of his person, his rights, and his property' --
before making the following comment: Security is the highest social
concept of civil society, the concept of police, expressing the fact
that the whole of society exists only in order to guarantee to each of
its members the preservation of his person, his rights, and his
property. As such, security is the insurance of the egoism of bourgeois
society (Marx, 1844/1975, pp. 162--164). Marx has put his finger on the
core ideological concept of bourgeois modernity: security. Security
underpins and overrides the other egotistic rights associated with
bourgeois modernity -- liberty, property, equality -- in order that
bourgeois egoism and capitalist order be guaranteed. Now, I have
previously taken Marx's comment to be a precursor to his claim a few
years later in The Manifesto of the Communist Party about the
bourgeoisie constantly 'revolutionizing the instruments of production,
and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole
relations of society'. The 'constant revolutionizing of production,
uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting
uncertainty and agitation' which accompanies bourgeois rule is what gets
described today in the language of insecurity (Marx and Engels,
1848/1984, p. 487). Understood in terms of what has become the most
important political trope of contemporary politics, the suggestion seems
to be that at some fundamental level the order of capital is an order of
social insecurity. And yet, at the same time, this permanent insecurity
gives rise to a politics of security, reinforcing security's place as
the fundamental concept of bourgeois society. I have previously argued
that this can be interpreted in terms of the ways in which **[security
serves as a key principle of police power in constituting and regulating
capital and its modes of coercion and control]{.underline}** -- the
security of the community coincides with the security of the commodity
-- and have suggested that **[what is therefore now needed more than
anything is nothing less than a critique of security]{.underline}**
(Neocleous, 2008, also 2000, 2014, 2016; Neocleous and Rigakos, 2011).
If we take seriously a comment Marx makes (1843/1975, p. 142) in his
debate with Ruge, that **[the main task before us is not to change the
world]{.underline}** in the way envisaged by some socialists **[but,
rather, the ruthless critique of all that exists, including and
especially politics, law and religion]{.underline}**, then we might say
that for us right now **[the target of such a ruthless critique has to
be that new political religion called 'security'. Such a critique must
have as its target all the 'innovations' performed in security's name,
including those claiming to be 'socially responsible'.]{.underline}**
Capital creates insecurity and insecurity creates a demand and desire
for security. To this demand and desire, capital responds with all its
usual creativity, in the form of innovation after innovation. Security
is therefore highly productive for capital. To be productive for
capital, security must first be translated into the materiality of the
commodity. Marx notes that as soon as something emerges as a commodity,
it changes into a thing that transcends sensuousness, in such a way that
gives the commodity a mystical value. If this is so for the commodity in
general, then commodities presented in security terms are at an added
advantage as they appear to serve the satisfaction of a very basic, and
yet also very indeterminate, human need. But Marx's point is that
commodity production per se is far from obvious and trivial. Tracing the
contours of the production of security commodities takes us to the heart
of the process whereby security becomes fetishistically inscribed in
commodified social relations. This is the basis of the security
industry. The expression 'industry' here refers not only to the
connection between security and the commodity form but also to the
rationalization, distribution, production and consumption of security.
It likewise incorporates the spectacle of security.1 The security
industry does not engage in security because of an interest in actually
eradicating insecurity. But neither does it do so because it is
interested in 'social control' or 'surveillance'. Rather, it has a far
more mundane interest: making a profit. To make a profit the security
industry must sell security. And to sell security it must play on fears
and insecurities, must generate further fears and insecurities, and must
pander to the idea that our fears and insecurities are very real and
must be dealt with in some way. The security industry therefore
interpellates consumers as both sovereign subjects ('the customer is
king') and as fearful subjects ('the customer is insecure'). The
customer must be reminded time and again of just how insecure they are,
revealing more than anything the extent to which capital has found a way
of dominating and terrorizing human beings within their very hearts and
souls. This is one reason why struggles against 'security measures'
alone are always so limiting: without connecting security to capital,
such struggles never address the basic antagonism of bourgeois society.
The security industry is thus where capital and security come to
contemplate themselves in a world of their own making, playing a key
role in the fabrication of the much wider culture of fear and insecurity
that is used to shore up both state and capital. Where the state uses
fear and insecurity to sustain support for the national security
project, the security industry turns the fear and insecurity into the
consumption of commodities. Where the security state thus perpetually
offers more and more 'solutions' in the form of new security policies,
the security industry offers 'solutions' in entirely commodified forms,
as more and more commodities are simply marketed as solutions to one
insecurity after another. The security industry thus uses its purported
concern for human beings and their security to reinforce the logic of
both security and the commodity form across the face of society. To the
extent that both capital and the state live off the production of fear
and insecurity, they must also ensure that security is something never
really achieved. Behind the slogan 'Security now!' lies the real double-
sided message: on the one hand, 'Security with the next security
product' (the message from capital); on the other hand, 'Security with
the next security measure' (the message from the state). Yet both the
security industry and the security state perpetually cheat us of what
has been promised. The promissory note is endlessly prolonged, revealing
that, ultimately, the promise is illusory: all that is confirmed is that
the real target will never be reached. Security is revealed to be an
illusion. Part of security's illusory power requires a passive
acceptance of all the things done in security's name and all the things
state and capital want us to take most seriously as needing securing:
property and commodity, law and order. Security wants us to believe that
nothing other than that which is called security is good, or at least
that whatever else might be considered good is nowhere nearly as good as
security itself. Moreover, it wants us to believe that that which is
good must be secure. Security thereby subjugates living humans to
security itself. In so doing, it masks the real impoverishment of human
life. Worse, it functions in such a way that this impoverishment is
understood as the very thing that needs to be secured. If the main task
of ideology is to get us to believe that 'the bourgeois way of thinking
is the normal way of thinking' (Marx, 1859/1987, p. 315), then security
is ideology par excellence, integral to the system of domination which
now encloses the world, where each individual trembles lest they be
found guilty of transgressing the boundaries imposed by security and its
demands. This is why security is so demanding: it is nearly impossible
to unravel the demands that security imposes on us and the immense
labour that security incessantly performs on us, a labour that in turn
produces new demands on us as subjects, new norms by which we are
measured, new targets towards which we should be striving, new
mechanisms through which hopes and dreams are to be thwarted. Witness,
for example, the phenomenon that has been described as neoliberalism.
Much can and has been made of the ways in which neoliberalism involves a
transformation of the individual: 'economics are the method; the object
is to change the heart and soul', as Margaret Thatcher (Sunday Times,
1981) once put it. Taking such a claim seriously means reading
neoliberalism not simply in terms of its destructive power, for example
in destroying certain kinds of rights and institutions, but also in
terms of its productive power: in its ability to create new kinds of
social relations, new ways of living and new political subjects. The
literature on the new neoliberal subject recognizes more than anything
that what is being produced is an entrepreneurial self and a productive
subject: a monetized, atomized and calculating subject that is required
and expected to endlessly perform as a neoliberal subject in the social
realm as well as in the marketplace (Dardot and Laval, 2013). This
production of new subjectivities, however, is also very much an
orientation of the subject around security: new political subjects
forged through security, operating for security and organized around
security. In other words, security- conscious neoliberal subjects. The
connection between security and capital is thus integral to the
neoliberal revolution and part of neoliberalism's productive power and
disciplinary core. (As with so many aspects of neoliberalism, what is of
most interest is its disciplinary moment, and at the heart of this
disciplinary moment lies the logic of security.) The explosion and
expansion of security in the last two decades, while conventionally
connected to the problem of terrorism (the 'war on terror'), might just
as properly be connected to the attempt to engrain neoliberalism into
the hearts and minds of political subjects. Moreover, because the
neoliberal subject is expected to be an active subject, this activity is
also expected to respond to the demands of security as well as the
demands of capital. As is well known, under neoliberalism it is no
longer enough for us to simply work, earn our money, go home and spend
it. Now we must believe in the work we are doing and actively show that
we believe in it, identifying with the organization and signing up to
the company's mission, vision and values. The neoliberal workplace has
become a 'community of desire', as Frédéric Lordon puts it, and yet this
poses a problem for capital, which constantly questions the worker's
desire. In Lordon's example: the employee- subject swears that they have
no other passion than the manufacture of yoghurt, our company's
business, but can we really believe them? (Lordon, 2015, p. 84). The
answer has to be no, and so the expected desire must be constantly
expressed, measured and assessed, since it is always in danger of
fading. A similar point might be made about the neoliberal polity, and
likewise about the neoliberal security state: the citizen- subject
swears that they have no other interest than the security of the social
order, but can we really believe them? The answer must again be no,2 and
so the expected desire must also be constantly expressed, measured and
assessed, since it is always in danger of fading. Herein lies the basis
for all the actions we are now being trained to undertake as security-
conscious neoliberal subjects, such as being trained in 'resilience',
being taught to be constantly 'prepared for emergency', and being
encouraged to report any friends, family, lovers, neighbours and
colleagues who we suspect might be doing something 'suspicious'
(Neocleous, 2013, 2016, 2017). Part of the novelty of neoliberalism lies
precisely in the idea that this active subject is not expected to remain
content with the simple exchange of security for obedience, but, rather,
is to be actively mobilized around the logic of security. Security has
become a neoliberal mobilization regime: the people mobilized in the
name of security as well as capital. Such mobilization is yet another
way of incorporating the people into security and another way in which
security expresses its desire to exist without reply, just like capital
and the state. Part of the illusion of security is that we are expected
to bow down before it without even asking what it is or how it came to
be granted such a status. To exist without reply, security seeks to
nullify all dissent and suppress any rebellion even before such dissent
and rebellion have begun. Any objections or resistance to any of the
policies -- not least the economic policies -- being carried out by the
powers which claim to exercise security on our behalf are met either
with security measures of the most coercive kind or with the expectation
that reason must abase itself before it -- all our critical faculties
set aside as security and its leading defenders tell us to shut up,
listen and obey. Those arguing against austerity, for example, are
treated first and foremost as a threat to national security. Thus, far
from security being emancipation, as some people working in the academic
sector of the security industry like to claim and which is the very
belief that security wants us to hold, the articulation of security as
an overarching principle of politics -- the idea, in other words, that
security is the absolute foundation of all politics, or that security
has to be the starting point for any political thought, or that security
is the grounds on which we must accept the protection of the state, or
that what all of us would most like for Christmas is security -- is
nothing less than the articulation of a demand for obedience. Security
is in this sense central to the containment of social change, nothing
less than the principle and process of pacification, if by
'pacification' we understand not simply the military crushing of
resistance but, rather, the fabrication of social order (Neocleous,
2011, 2017; Neocleous, Rigakos and Wall, 2013). What does this obedience
in the name of security produce? The answer is not difficult: obedience
itself. Obedience produces obedience, as Foucault once commented (2014,
p. 270) about what he called 'pastoral power'. It reproduces itself as a
system of obedience. That is, one accepts the principle of security in
order to become obedient and one reproduces this state of obedience in a
striving for the mythical state of security. Hence one is expected to
manage oneself in the way that a security operative would have us be
managed. This is the very point to which Hobbes alludes in the final
paragraph of Leviathan; it is the very same point understood by all
contemporary politicians when they speak the language of security; and
it is the point implicit in much of the discourse and policies
surrounding terrorism, which is why so much anti- terror legislation
concerns itself with the obedience of the population. Obedience thereby
becomes a permanent way of being, and we are encouraged and expected to
believe that obedience is essential to the security of the subject.
Obedience becomes fundamental to the principle of raison d'état,
demanded by the state for security reasons, and our training in
obedience a training of and for political order. And, given the
security--commodity nexus, what we are being made obedient for is
nothing other than the domination of our lives by capital. Security,
then, demands that we bow down to security. It demands that we feel
secure in our insecurity as bourgeois subjects but also insecure in our
security as bourgeois subjects. It demands that we commit ourselves not
to making history but, rather, to the eternal recurrence of the same: to
securing capital and the state rather than anything against it or
opposed to them. Like capital, security wants us to believe that it is
our fate. Opening his book Politics and Fate, Andrew Gamble asks: 'If
politics were at an end, if this was our fate, what would this mean for
us?' (2000, p. 1). One answer: it would mean nothing less than being
stuck in an endless security experience. 'How was your security
experience today?', the questionnaire at Heathrow airport demands, after
making us undergo a series of security rituals. An endless security
experience, then, but one in which we are constantly asked to assess,
measure and confirm our happiness in being able to participate in the
rituals and thus in the process to confirm the extent to which security
dominates our lives. A second answer to Gamble's question: it would mean
being subjected to one security innovation after another, including
those innovations sold to us as being somehow 'socially responsible'.
Innovation is one of the dominant ideas of our time. 'Innovation is
everywhere', notes Benoît Godin. In the world of goods (technology)
certainly, but also in the realm of words: innovation is discussed in
the scientific and technical literature, in social sciences like
history, sociology, management and economics, and in the humanities and
arts. Innovation is also a central idea in the popular imaginary, in the
media, in public policy, and is part of everybody's vocabulary . (Godin,
2008, p. 5) As Godin notes, innovation has become the emblem of modern
society and a panacea for resolving any and all of society's problems.
Despite its close association with the seemingly neutral terrain of
technology, innovation is in fact a deeply political concept. But as a
political concept, its connotations have changed dramatically over the
centuries. 'Innovation' was for centuries a pejorative term, because
innovation itself was regarded as a vice. Innovation, Godin notes, was
regulated by Kings for centuries, forbidden by law and punished. Advice
books and treatises for Princes and courtiers support this
understanding, and include instructions not to innovate. Books of
manners and sermons urge people not to meddle with innovation, and
bishops visit parishes to make sure that the instruction is followed.
From the Renaissance onward, innovation is also a linguistic weapon used
by political writers and pamphleteers against their enemies (Godin,
2013, p. 8, 2015, pp. 5, 10--11). Entrenched ideas about the power of
'tradition' and 'order' meant that the innovator and innovation were
suspect. On the one hand, in religious terms, innovation was considered
heretical: 'innovation and heresy were practically synonymous' (Preus,
1972, p. 2). On the other hand, in political terms, innovation was
considered revolutionary, as witnessed by Edmund Burke's Reflections on
the Revolution in France, in which Burke castigates the 'spirit of
innovation' found among revolutionaries. According to Burke, innovation
is the result of a 'selfish temper', 'confined views' and a 'furious
spirit'; a good and proper politics consists in a 'sullen resistance to
innovation' (Burke, 1790/1968, pp. 119, 181, 211, 237, 320, 325,
1795/1992, p. 271). The fact that no revolutionary ever thought of
describing their own politics in terms of 'innovation' tells us that
'innovation' was a term used pejoratively by anti- revolutionaries
against those questioning the political order. Innovation was thus a
word used for polemical purposes and in a pejorative way, 'a linguistic
weapon used against an enemy: the revolutionary, the republican and, in
the nineteenth century, the socialist' (Godin, 2013, p. 17, also pp.
6--8, 11--12, 2015, p. 5). All of that gradually changed with the
conceptual revolution associated with the emergence of new time (neue
Zeit) or modernity (Neuzeit) in the late eighteenth century. Core to the
formation of the new time of modernity is what Reinhart Koselleck
identifies as a shift in which key concepts play on the general
criterion of modernity's 'dynamization' and 'acceleration'. Such
concepts no longer simply define a given state of affairs but instead
'reach into the future' (Koselleck, 2004, p. 80, 2002, pp. 154--169).
The concept which most clearly captures Koselleck's point about dynamism
and the future is the one on which he focuses, namely 'revolution', but
the point applies equally to 'innovation' (Nowotny, 2008). In the
history of the concept 'innovation', a transition period therefore
occurs between the late eighteenth century and the mid- nineteenth
century in which an increasingly neutral use of the term coexists with
the pejorative use, and then the pejorative use slowly dies out as an
increasingly positive understanding of the term coincides with the
neutral, to the point that by the twentieth century, innovation had
become a more or less entirely positive term (Godin, 2015, p. 16). The
shift coincides with the embrace of innovation by both capital and the
state. People start to talk about the age of industrial capital as a new
'age of innovation'. The 'spirit of innovation' no longer describes
revolutionaries seeking to overthrow the existing order but rather those
who seek to contribute to its continual 'improvement' and 'civilization'
(two other keywords in capitalist mentality -- see Neocleous, 2014). The
'spirit of innovation' becomes part and parcel of the 'spirit of
capitalism', as innovation itself becomes the foundation for something
called 'progress', a category which is itself 'specifically calibrated
to cope with modern experiences, namely that traditional experiences are
surpassed by new ones with astonishing speed' (Koselleck, 2002, pp.
219--220). Capital is a category of movement and 'innovation' a term
that gives voice to this movement, in the process becoming part and
parcel of bourgeois ideology. Now, on the one hand, this indicates that
innovation has become part of the self- understanding of the bourgeois
revolution, for as well as implying technological advance, it also
connotes all those things which the bourgeoisie likes to see in itself
as a class: creativity, productivity, liberty and progress. This is
summed up most precisely in Joseph Schumpeter's The Theory of Economic
Development (1911), which identifies innovation as the central feature
of economic development and the entrepreneur as the central figure
behind it (Schumpeter, 1911/1983). Bourgeois thought has transformed
this into a more generalized theory of commerce (albeit rooted in a
certain conception of technology) and then generalized it further still
into ideas about 'organizational innovation', in which the 'spirit of
innovation' is assumed to reside not so much in individuals but in the
organization itself. (Such spirit was initially associated with the
capitalist firm, but very quickly became applied to the organization per
se.) From there the term has come to incorporate positive changes in
politics, law and culture as well, reflecting its fundamental place in
society's conception of itself. Either way, 'innovative' is now a form
of praise and people are criticized for not being innovative enough.
Individuals, organizations, companies, capital, nations and states are
all expected to know what innovation means, to treat it as an
unconditional good and to take part in the process (Nowotny, 2008, p.
141; Godin, 2013, p. 18). Rather like security, innovation has become
more or less a duty. On the one hand, then, 'innovation' has become a
concept around which capital and the state operate and cooperate. On the
other hand, socialists have sought to give innovation a 'social' twist.
Starting in the nineteenth century, social reforms began to be conceived
of as social innovations and, at the same time, social innovations began
to be considered in terms of their contribution to social reform -- or,
better still, considered in terms of their contribution to something
understood by social reformers as 'progress'. I suspect that the
commitment to socially responsible innovations (in security or anything
else) has something to do with the idea of progress. Koselleck's claim
that 'since the nineteenth century, it has become difficult to gain
political legitimacy without being progressive at the same time'
(Koselleck, 2002, p. 230) applies in particular to the ways in which
social reformers ('progressives') like to use key concepts such as
innovation. Thus, alongside the discourse of technological or commercial
innovation, 'one now hears discourses on "social innovation", meaning
either major advances in the social sciences, policy/institutional
reforms for the betterment of society, or solutions to social needs and
problems, coming from the community sectors among others' (Godin, 2008,
p. 46). For progressives, the concept of progress contains the idea that
innovations can and should be a good thing, so long as they are
delivered in the spirit of liberty and democracy. For progressives this
means that innovation has to be, in the style of most of the
contributions to this book, socially responsible. To put it in Arendtian
terms for a moment (Arendt, 1963), one might say that socially
responsible innovations are a means of importing 'the social question'
into the concept of innovation. How does this affect the claims made
here about security? If 'innovation is a concept that everyone
understands spontaneously -- or thinks he understands' (Godin, 2015, p.
3, emphasis added), then that is even more the case with what we are
expected to accept as a 'socially responsible innovation', and it is
especially the case with socially responsible innovation in something
else that we think we understand, namely security. Now, one might note
here Helga Nowotny's point that the concept of security and the idea of
a rationality promising security are inherently unable to keep pace with
the acceleration and expansion of possibilities opened up by the world
of continuous innovation (Nowotny, 2008, pp. 15, 39--40, 140). In other
words, continual innovation surely contributes to the constant change
and everlasting uncertainty that is the foundation of much that goes by
the name of 'insecurity'. But that is not my point. My point, rather, is
that if socially responsible innovation is a concept specifically
calibrated to cope with the quintessentially modern experience of the
constant revolutionizing of the instruments and relations of production
-- the fact that 'all that is solid melts into air', in Marx and
Engels's felicitous phrase -- in such a way that something 'progressive'
might still come out of the experience, so we might say that the idea of
socially responsible innovation in security is an idea specifically
calibrated to cope with the quintessentially modern experience of the
constant revolutionizing of everything that goes under the name of
security. Yet **[to organize and mobilize in the name of socially
responsible innovation in security is nonetheless to organize and
mobilize in the name of security.]{.underline}** Moreover, as I have
been trying to suggest in the first half of this chapter, **[it is
likewise to mobilize in the name of capital. What 'socially responsible
innovation in security' gives us, then, is little more than yet another
way of participating in the logic of security.]{.underline}** Adopting a
term straight out of the discourse of capital ('innovation'), and adding
to it one of the key terms of corporate neoliberal power (namely
'corporate social responsibility'), socially responsible innovations in
security appear to be **[little more than new ways of rendering the
social over to the powers of state and capital.]{.underline}** One might
extend this observation by pointing out that although it is generally
assumed that the whole point of innovation is that it surprises -- 'the
greater the surprise, the more innovative the idea' (Nowotny, 2008, p.
103) -- **[rarely is anything actually genuinely surprising offered in
socially responsible innovations in security. Quite the opposite, in
fact: accepting entirely the logic of security, all such innovations do
is try and moderate this logic by somehow recognizing 'privacy' or
'liberty', or by not being too discriminatory or exclusionary, or by
being less under the corporate powers within the security
industry.]{.underline}** Ultimately, the least surprising thing of all
happens: **[security still wins. Worse, security wins by having the
whole of the social offered up to it, and offered up to it by the new
'socially progressive' advisors]{.underline}** to Princes, those whose
political vision commits us to what we are told must be our fate: **[one
security experience after another, one security scare after another, one
recovery from each security scare after another, one security innovation
after another. The more dominant a concept becomes, the more
unimaginable the means by which those living under its spell might break
that domination.]{.underline}** In the case of security, **[the only way
to imagine breaking its domination is to begin with its ruthless
critique. To advocate socially responsible innovation in security is to
advocate conformity rather than critique. If somebody offers you a
socially responsible innovation in security, just say no.]{.underline}**

#### Critique must come first -- rethinking political ethics means rethinking the fundamental assumptions of the state & security

[**Burke 2007** \[Anthony, Senior Lecturer in Politics and IR at
University of New South Wales, Beyond Security: Ethics, and Violence,
<http://opac.lib.idu.ac.id/unhan-ebook/assets/uploads/files/e40b8-041.beyond-security-ethics-and-violence.pdf>,

This chapter is thus an exercise in thinking, which challenges the
continuing power of [political ontologies]{.underline} (forms of truth
and being) that [connect security, sovereignty, belonging, otherness and
violence in way**s that**]{.underline} for many [appear like enduring
political facts, inevitable and irrefutable]{.underline}. [Conflict,
violence and alienation]{.underline} then arise not merely from
individual or collective acts whose conditions might be understood and
policed; they [**condition politics as such, forming a permanent ground,
a dark substrata underpinning the very possibility of the**
present]{.underline}. [**Conflict and alienation** seem **inevitable
because of the way in which the modern political imagination has
conceived and thought security, sovereignty and ethics**]{.underline}.
Israel/ Palestine is chosen here as a particularly urgent and complex
example of this problem, but it is a problem with much wider
significance. While I hold out the hope that [security can be
re-visioned away from a permanent dependence on insecurity, exclusion
and violence]{.underline}, and I believe it retains normative promise,
this analysis takes a deliberate step backward to examine the very real
barriers faced by such a project. [Security cannot properly be rethought
without a deeper understanding of, and challenge to, the political forms
and structures it claims to enable and protect]{.underline}. If Ken
Booth argues that the state should be a means rather than an end of
security, my objective here is to place the continuing power and depth
of its status as an end of security, and a fundamental source for
political identity, under critical interrogation.[\' If the state is to
become a means of security]{.underline} (one among many) [it will have
to be fundamentally transformed]{.underline}. The chapter pursues this
inquiry in two stages. The first outlines the historic strength and
effective redundancy of such an exciusivist vision of security in
Israel, wherein Israel not only confronts military and political
antagonists with an \'iron wall\' of armed force but maps this onto a
profound clash of existential narratives, a problem with resonances in
the West\'s confrontation with radical Islamism in the war on terror.
The second, taking up the remainder of the chapter, then explores a
series of potential resources in continental philosophy and political
theory that might help us to think our way out of a security grounded in
violence and alienation. Through a [critical engagement]{.underline}
with this thought, I aim to [construct a political ethics
based]{.underline} not in relations between insecure and separated
identities mapped solely onto nation-states, but [in relations of
responsibility and interconnection that can negotiate and recognise both
distinct and intertwined histories]{.underline}, identities and needs;
[**an eth**ics that might underpin a vision of
interdepende**nt**]{.underline} (national and non-national) [existence
proper to an integrated world traversed by endless flows of people,
commerce, ideas, violence and future potential]{.underline}.

#### [Ignorance DA]{.underline}---It has the additional consequence of making us unaware of the terms of the rationality that generate forms of power, precluding successful critique.

[**Brown 01** \[Wendy, Prof of Political Theory @ UC Berkeley, Politics
Out of History. p 115-116\]]{.underline}

Regardless of whether Foucault is invoking political rationality as a
proper or improper noun, the invocation calls attention to the limited
efficacy of any resistance or critique that attacks only the effects of
a particular rationality rather than the scheme as a whole. In this
regard, political rationality may be seen as replacing the notion of
\"the system\" in political thinking, a notion that seeks to reach
beyond epiphenomenal injustices in order to criticize the grounds of
those injustices: \"[[Those who resist or rebel against]{.mark} a form
of [power cannot]{.mark} merely [be content to denounce violence or
criticize an institution]{.mark}. Nor is it enough to cast the blame on
reason in general. What has to be questioned is the form of rationality
at stake. . . . [Liberation can only come from attacking]{.mark} . . .
[political rationality\'s]{.mark} very [roots.\"]{.mark}2]{.underline}8
**[[It is]{.mark} precisely [the difference between]{.mark} a
\"[rationality\" and]{.mark} a \"[system\" that is significant
in]{.mark} Foucault\'s [reformulation of the
political]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and that prevents this]{.underline}
seemingly foundational account from being so. For [unlike the coherently
bounded, internally consistent (or internally contradictory), and
relatively ahistorical figure of a system, a [political rationality
cannot be apprehended through empirical description or abstract
principles]{.mark},]{.underline} nor can it be falsified through general
critique[. [Political rationalities are orders of practice]{.mark} and
orders of discourse, [not systems]{.mark} of rule; what must be captured
for them to be subject to political criticism is their composition as
well as their contingent nature]{.underline}. Similarly[, the
exploitable weaknesses in a political rationality are not systemic
contradictions; they are instead effects of]{.underline} fragmented
histories, colliding discourses, forces that persisted without
triumphing decisively, unintended effects, and [arguments insecure about
themselves. **Such weaknesses [cannot be exploited through]{.mark}
philosophical [critique that remains internal to]{.mark} or unaware of
[the terms of a particular rationality]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Genealogical critique aims to reveal various rationalities as the ones
in which we live, to articulate them as particular forms of rationality.
This articulation enables us to call into question the terms of
political analysis from a standpoint outside those terms as well as to
discern the historically produced fissures in their construction. Hence
Foucault\'s remark that \"[[the history of various forms of rationality
is]{.mark}]{.underline} sometimes [[more effective in unsettling our
certitudes and dogmatism than is **abstract
criticism**]{.mark}**.\"**]{.underline}

The aim of this contribution is to re-centre political thought again by
exploring the views of a series of political philosophers and
interlocutors who share the view that '**[the political' needs urgent
attention, particularly in an environment that is sutured by a view of
the 'end of politics' and the consolidation of a post-political and
post-democratic condition]{.underline}**. In the first part of the
paper, I shall briefly consider the reduction, accelerating rapidly over
the past few decades, of the political terrain to a post-democratic
arrangement of oligarchic policing. The latter refers to the domination,
to the attempted suturing of social space, by an instituted police order
in which expert administration (a science/technology-management-policy
assemblage), the naturalisation of the political to the management of a
presumably inevitable ordering, and the desire for 'good governance' by
an administrative elite in tandem with an economic oligarchy has
occupied and increasingly tries to fill out, to suture, the spatiality
of the political. In other words, **[[the space of the political is
increasingly colonised and saturated by the spaces of
policies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In a second part, I shall attempt to
re-centre the political by drawing on the work of a range of political
theorists and philosophers who have begun to question this post-
political order. Despite significant differences among them, they share
a series of common understandings about what constitutes the domain of
the political. The theme of the final section will be to consider the
contours for reclaiming political democracy. I shall argue that
democracy and democratic politics, and the spaces for democratic
engagement need to be taken back from the post-political oligarchic
constituent police order that has occupied and filled out the spaces of
instituted democracy. It is in these political spaces that utopias as
concrete political interventions germinate. The sort of utopia that
Žižek argues is urgently needed today: "\[t**[\]he true utopia is when
the situation is so without issue, without a way to resolve it within
the coordinates of the possible that out of the pure urge of survival
you have to invent a new space. Utopia is not kind of a free
imagination; utopia is a matter of innermost urgency. [You are forced to
imagine it as the only way out, and this is what we need
today]{.mark}]{.underline}**["]{.mark} (Žižek 2005).

The Post-Political and Post-Democratic Condition "There is a shift form
the model of the polis founded on a centre, that is, a public centre or
agora, to a new metropolitan spatialisation that is certainly invested
in a process of de-politicisation, which results in a strange zone where
it is impossible to decide what is private and what is public" (Agamben
2006). Pierre Rosanvallon, in his search for a renewed political
democracy, laments the recent obsession with (good) 'governance' as the
new name of a government that would be sufficient for everyone, that
would encompass, suture, the social order. For him, this replaces
"politics by widely disseminated techniques of management, leaving room
for one sole actor on the scene: international society, uniting under
the same banner the champions of the market and the prophets of law"
(Rosanvallon 2006: 228). These arrangements of 'good' governance relate
to those who embrace "the development of a new type of civil society
that would finally substitute for the world of politics. On this front
one finds the naïve representatives of NGOs -- leftists who have
re-invented themselves as humanitarians -- and the executives of
multinational corporations, all of whom commune together today in a
touching defense of an international civil society. The utopias of the
one, alas, are hardly different from the hypocrisies of the others"
(Rosanvallon 2006: 228). Slavoj Žižek defines such '**[[governance' as
post-political arrangements that focus on the administration (policing)
of environmental, social, economic or other domains: "The ultimate sign
of post-politics in all Western countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**", he
argues, "**[[is the growth of a managerial approach to
government:]{.mark} government is [reconceived as a managerial
function]{.mark}, deprived of its proper political
dimension]{.underline}**" (Žižek 2002a: 303). [**[This post-political
frame reduces politics to the sphere of governing and polic(y)ing
through allegedly participatory deliberative procedures]{.underline}**,
**[with a given distribution of places and
functions]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** one that excludes
those who are deemed 'irresponsible' (see (Raco 2003);(Baeten
2008);(Swyngedouw 2008a)). It is policy- making set within a given
distribution of what is possible and driven by a desire for consent
within a context of recognized difference[. **[The
stakeholders]{.underline}**]{.mark} (i.e. those with recognized
speech**[) [are known in advance and disruption or dissent is reduced to
the instituted and institutional modalities of governing]{.mark}, the
technologies of expert administration and management]{.underline}**,
**[to the dispositifs]{.underline}** (see (Agamben 2007)) **[of 'good
governance']{.underline}**: "In post-politics**[, the conflict of global
ideological visions embodied in different parties which compete for
power is replaced by the collaboration of enlightened
technocrats]{.underline}** (economists, public opinion specialists ...)
**[and liberal multiculturalists; via the process of negotiation of
interests[, a compromise is reached in the guise of a more or less
universal consensus.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Post-politics thus
emphasizes the need to leave old ideological visions behind and confront
new issues, armed with the necessary expert knowledge and free
deliberation that takes people's concrete needs and demands into
account." (Žižek 1999b: 198) "**[The political]{.underline}** (the space
of litigation in which the excluded can protest the wrong/injustice done
to them), \[**[is\] foreclosed ... It is crucial to perceive ... the
post-political suspension of the political in the reduction of the state
to a mere police agent servicing the]{.underline}** **[(consensually
established) needs of the market forces]{.underline}** and
multiculturalist tolerant humanitarianism" (Zizek, 2006: 72). This
post-political condition takes the scandalous proposition of Marx that
the state is the executive branch of the capitalist class as literally
true: identifying politics with the management of capitalism is no
longer a hidden secret behind the appearance of formal democracy; it has
become the openly declared basis for democratic legitimacy.
**[Maximizing the enjoyment of the people can only be achieved by
declaring the inability or incapacity of the people]{.underline}** (as a
political name) **[to arrange or manage themselves]{.underline}** the
conditions of this maximization[. **[The power of post-political
democracy resides,]{.underline}**]{.mark} in other words, **[[in the
declaration of its impotence to act politically]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Rancière 1998: 113). Moreover, any denunciation or any struggle against
this tactic of depoliticisation is regarded as going against historical
necessity. Once again drawing on a populist and perverted Marxism, those
protesting are deemed to go against the grain of history and belong to
an outdated social group embracing transcended ideologies. The irony is
indeed how depoliticisation is effectuated by a certain return to Marx
(Rancière 2005b: 95). The post-political in its instituted democratic
form, of course, elevates the 'scandal of democracy' to new heights.
This 'scandal' refers to the democratic promise of the identity of the
state with the people, a promise that must, of necessity, annul the
constitutive antagonisms that cut through 'the people'. While the place
of power in democracy is structurally vacant (as it is liberated from
the god-given location on which pre-modern state power was legitimized
-- (see (Lefort 1994)), yet is metaphorically filled with 'the people'
as sovereign, those who occupy the place of power and democracy must
suture the social order, contain the inherent antagonisms of the social
order by suturing social space; the totality of the social is presented
in the body of the state. This impossibility, the rupture of the
democratic condition from within, is exactly where Claude Lefort (but
see also Hannah Arendt from a slightly different perspective (Ahrendt
1973)) locates the totalitarian kernel of democratic forms (Lefort
1986**[). Democracy's dark underbelly resides exactly in how its
identification with the people can drive towards a position where the
occupation of the place of power identifies with the whole of the
people, disavows the constitutive conflicts within the social order and
the gap between the place of political and the social ordering of the
people]{.underline}**. Post-politics is caught in this tension: **[[the
disappearance of the political as the space for the enunciation of
dissensus]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see below) **[[and the suturing of
social space by the post-political order harbours authoritarian
gestures]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see (Swyngedouw 2000), **[[exactly by
foreclosing the possibility for the political to
emerge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In sum, **[post-politics]{.underline}**
is of necessity a violation of democracy. It **[requires foreclosing or
displacing dissent and manufacturing consent]{.underline}** and,
therefore, annuls the proper democratic political. Indeed, the tension
between the Multiple of the Political and the Singular or the One of
Policy (Swyngedouw 2008b) is overlaid by the 'scandal of democracy', its
impossible core that promises pluralist dissensual arrangements, yet
institutes exclusive, singular, consensual practices. Indeed,
post-politics refuses politicisation which aims at "more" than the
negotiation of interests. A consensual post- politics arises that either
eliminates fundamental conflict (usually by invoking the whole of the
people -- (see (Swyngedouw 2007a) and/or elevates it to Schmittian
antithetical ultra-politics (Schmitt 1996**[[). The consensual times we
are currently living in have thus eliminated a genuine political space
of disagreement.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Propelled on by a drive towards
reflexivity, **[[the need to make decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}** on
processes with high risk low probability (Beck's risk society thesis) on
the one hand and the injunction to choose in the absence of any
grounding or guarantee in truth, **[[transfers administrative powers
increasingly to a technocratic-scientific elite who is supposed to know
and (cap)able to manage the situation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [**[While
difficulties and problems are staged and generally accepted as
problematic]{.underline}** (**[such
as]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** for example, climate
change, social exclusion, **[[economic competitiveness,]{.mark} and the
like), [they need to be dealt with through compromise, managerial and
technical arrangement, and the production of
consensus]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Consensus, in a very precise sense, is
for Rancière the key condition of post-politics: "Consensus refers to
that which is censored ... Consensus means that whatever your personal
commitments, interests and values may be, you perceive the same things,
you give them the same name. But there is no contest on what appears, on
what is given in a situation and as a situation. Consensus means that
the only point of contest lies on what has to be done as a response to a
given situation. Correspondingly, dissensus and disagreement don't only
mean conflict of interests, ideas and so on. They mean that there is a
debate on the sensible givens of a situation, a debate on that which you
see and feel, on how it can be told and discussed, who is able to name
it and argue about it ... It is about the visibilities of the places and
abilities of the body in those places, about the partition of private
and public spaces, about the very configuration of the visible and the
relation of the visible to what can be said about it ... Consensus is
the dismissal of politics as a polemical configuration of the common
world" (Rancière 2003b: §4- 6). Consensus, as the "the annulment of
dissensus" announces the "end of politics" (Rancière 2001: §32). This
post-political world eludes choice and freedom (other than those
tolerated by the consensus). However, consensus does not equal peace or
absence of fundamental conflict (Rancière 2005a: 8). Indeed, in the
absence of real politicization, the only position of real dissent is
that of either the traditionalist or the fundamentalist. The only way to
deal with them is by sheer violence, by suspending their 'humanitarian'
and 'democratic' rights. The **[post-political relies on either
including all in a consensual pluralist order and on excluding radically
those who posit themselves outside the consensus.]{.underline}** For the
latter, as Agamben (Agamben 2005) argues, **[the law is suspended; they
are literally put outside the law and treated as extremists and
terrorists]{.underline}**: **[those who are not with us are irremediably
against us, they constitute the enemy]{.underline}**. Invoking the
Whole/the One of the people, while denying the constitutive antagonisms
and splits within the people and that cut through the social order,
post-political governance is necessarily exclusive, partial, and
predicated upon outlawing those that do not subscribe to the consensual
arrangement. That is exactly why for Agamben 'the Camp' has become the
core figure to identify the condition of our time. In other words, a
Schmittian ultra- politics that lurks behind and underneath the
post-political consensual order and does not tolerate an outside, that
sutures the entire social space by the tyranny of the police (state) and
squeezes out the political, pits those who 'participate' in the
instituted configurations of the consensual post-political order
radically against those who are placed outside, like the sans-papiers,
political islam, radical environmentalists, communists and alter-
globalists, or the otherwise marginalized. The riots in the suburbs of
France's big cities in the fall of 2005 and the police responses to this
event were classic violent examples of such urban ultra-politics (see
Dikec, 2007). This post-political consensus, therefore, is radically
reactionary as it forestalls the articulation of divergent, conflicting,
and alternative trajectories of future socio-environmental and
socio-spatial possibilities and assemblages. There is no contestation
over the givens of the situation, over the partition of the sensible,
there is only debate over the technologies of management, the
arrangements of policing, the configuration of those who already have a
stake, whose voice is already recognized as legitimate. Consider, for
example, how current climate change policy aims to retro-fit the climate
with technological-managerial interventions in order to continue as
before, in order to make sure nothing changes fundamentally (see
(Swyngedouw 2007a), so that things go on as before! (Dean 2006).
Rancière, Mouffe and Crouch associate the political 'form' of this
post-political consensus with the emergence of post-democatic
institutional configurations: "Postdemocracy is the government practice
and conceptual legitimation of a democracy after the demos, a democracy
that has eliminated the appearance, miscount, and dispute of the people
and is thereby reducible to the sole interplay of state mechanisms and
combinations of social energies and interests ... Consensus demoracy is
a reasonable agreement between individuals and social groups who have
understood that knowing what is possible and negotiating between
partners are a way for each party to obtain the optimal share that the
objective givens of the situation allow them to hope for and which is
preferable to conflict. But for parties to opt for discussion rather
than a fight, they must exist as parties who then have to choose between
two ways of obrtaining their share .... What consensus thus presupposes
is the disappearance of any gap between a party to a dispute and a part
of society .... It is, in a word, the disappearance of politics"
(Rancière 1998: 102) (see also (Mouffe 2005: 29). This arrangement
assumes that "all parties are known and a world in which everything is
on show, in which parties are counted with none left over and in which
everything can be solved by objectifying problems" (Rancière 1998: 102).
There is no excess left over and above that what is instituted. There is
indeed a close relationship between the post- political condition and
the functioning of the political system. Colin Crouch, Chantalle Mouffe
and others insist that this kind of consensual post-politics is
paralleled by the rise of a post-democratic institutional configuration
((Crouch 2000, 2004). For Colin Crouch, there is a significant decline
of government by the people and for the people. Although the formal
configuration of democracy is still intact, there is a proliferating
arsenal of new processes that bypass, evacuate or articulate with these
formal institutions. I have elsewhere defined constituted post-democracy
as embodying new forms of autocratic Governance-Beyond-the-State
(Swyngedouw 2005) in which the act of governing is reconfigured on the
basis of a stakeholder arrangement of governance in which the
traditional state forms (national, regional, or local government)
partakes together with experts, NGOs, and other 'responsible' partners
(see Crouch, 2004) in partitioning the sensible, in organizing the
'distribution of places and functions'. This is the condition of
post-1991 democracy. **[[Not only is the political arena evacuated from
radical dissent, critique, and fundamental conflict]{.mark}, but the
parameters of democratic governing itself are being shifted, announcing
new forms of governmentality, in which traditional disciplinary society
is transfigured into a society of control through disembedded networks
of governance]{.underline}**. These new glocal forms of 'governance',
operative at a range of articulated spatial scales, are expressive of
the post-political configuration (Mouffe 2005: 103) (Swyngedouw 2007b)
(Swyngedouw 2008a). **[[These arrangements of
'governance-beyond-the-state' are resolutely put forward as an idealized
normative model]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see (Le Galès 2002) (Schmitter
2002) **[that promise to fulfill the conditions of good government "in
which the boundary between organisations and public and private sectors
has become permeable]{.underline}**" (Stoker 1998: 38). They are
constituted as presumably horizontally networked associations, and based
on interactive relations between independent and interdependent actors
that share a high degree of consensus and trust, despite internal
conflict and oppositional agendas, within selectively inclusive
participatory institutional or organisational settings. They imply a
common purpose, joint action, a framework of shared values, continuous
interaction and the wish to achieve collective benefits that cannot be
gained by acting independently (Stoker 1998) (Rakodi 2003). It is
predicated upon a consensual agreement on the existing conditions (the
state of the situation) and the main objectives to be achieved. They
exhibit an institutional configuration based on the inclusion of private
market actors, civil society groups, and parts of the 'traditional'
state apparatus (Lemke 2002) in which a particular rationality of
governing is combined with new technologies, instruments, and tactics of
conducting the process of collective rule-setting, implementation, and
often including policing as well.. The mobilised technologies of
governance revolve around individualisation, reflexive risk-calculation
(self-assessment), accountancy rules and accountancy based disciplining,
quantification and bench-marking of performance. As Lemke (2002: 50)
argues, such arrangements announce "a transformation of politics that
restructures the power relations in society. What we observe today is
not a diminishment or reduction of state sovereignty and planning
capacities, but a displacement from formal to informal techniques of
government and the appearance of new actors on the scene of government
(e.g. NGOs), that indicate fundamental transformations in statehood and
a renewed relation between state and civil society actors". Politics is
hereby reduced to the sphere of policy-making, to the domain of
governing and polic(y)ing through allegedly (and often imposed)
participatory deliberative procedures, with a given distribution of
places and functions. Consensual policy-making in which the stakeholders
(i.e. those with recognized speech) are known in advance and where
disruption or dissent is reduced to debates over the institutional
modalities of governing and the technologies of expert administration or
management, announces the end of politics, annuls dissent from the
consultative spaces of policy making and evacuates the proper political
from the public sphere. In this post-democratic post-political
constitution, adversarial politics (of the left/right variety or of
radically divergent struggles over imagining and naming different
socio-environmental futures for example) are considered hopelessly out
of date. Although **[[disagreement and debate]{.underline}]{.mark}** are
of course still possible, they **[[operate within an overall model of
elite consensus and agreemen]{.mark}t]{.underline}** (Crouch 2004**[),
[subordinated to a managerial-technocratic regime]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(see also (Jörke 2005) (Blühdorn 2006)), **[sustained by a series of
populist tactics.]{.underline}** **[What is at stake then, is the
practice of genuine democracy]{.underline}**, of a return to the polis,
the public space for the encounter and negotiation of disagreement,
where those who have no place, are not counted or named, can acquire, or
better still, appropriate voice, become part of the police. [But
**[before we can consider this, we need to return to the possibilities
of 'thinking the political'.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Thinking the
political I situate my argument of what constitutes the political in the
interstices between two great, but radically opposed, perspectives that
have galvanised much of progressive and leftist energies over the past
few years. The first one is Hardt and Negri's Empire and the immanent
force of the multitude whose energies are liberated through the
vicissitudes of empire, which in its womb, already harbours and nurtures
the free reign of the multitude that will transgress and revolutionise
the very disempowering and unequally constituted constellation of Empire
(Hardt and Negri 2001). Indeed, as they could claim at the end of their
book, there is an unbearable lightness in being communist as the
immanent force of the multitude will realise itself through some sort of
mythical energetic force. The multitude as political agent, from their
perspective, grows out of and supplants Empire as a necessary,
teleological, revolutionary gesture; political subjectivity is barred,
annulled; the forces of empire will just do the trick. In this sense,
the observation that Hardt and Negri have written the Communist
Manifesto for the 21st Century is correct; **[it breathes the same
unrelenting belief in the immanence of the multitude as it will emerge
from the debris of a transcended imperial order, and a politics of
egalibertarian emancipation is already structurally fermenting within
the interstices of rhizomatic and decentred imperial
reign]{.underline}**. Second, and at the other side of the spectre
stands, symbolically speaking, John Holloway's Change the world without
taking power (Holloway 2002). For him, radical transformation resides in
continuous political activism, the obsessive desire for becoming that
supplants the need for being, for spatialisation. His emancipatory
politics adheres to the sort of activism that asks the constituent
oligarchic polity of state and of economy to change, to take the demands
seriously**[. It [is political acting that aims at changing the elites
not at their transformation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, let alone their
replacement in a different constituent order. While the political is an
immanent process borne out of the configurations of empire for Negri, it
is the obsessive activist, driven by a desire for justice and an
analytical toolkit that situates injustices within the contours of the
politico-economic and socio-cultural order that holds the promise for
radical change for Holloway. Simon Critchley offers an
ethico-philosophical foundation for such anarchic 'politics of
resistance' (Critchley 2007). For Slavoj Žižek, such politics of
resistance has de facto accepted the inevitability of capitalism's
global hegemony and retreats in the bulwark of localised political
activism, centred on a critique of what is and acts around the provision
of a space for the multitude of new subjectivities. In a review of this
position, Zizek (Žižek 2007) states: "The big demonstrations in London
and Washington against the US attack on Iraq a few years ago offer an
exemplary case of this strange symbiotic relationship between power and
resistance. Their paradoxical outcome was that both sides were
satisfied. The protesters saved their beautiful souls: they made it
clear that they don't agree with the government's policy on Iraq. Those
in power calmly accepted it, even profited from it: not only did the
protests in no way prevent the already-made decision to attack Iraq;
they also served to legitimise it. Thus George Bush's reaction to mass
demonstrations protesting his visit to London, in effect: 'You see, this
is what we are fighting for, so that what people are doing here --
protesting against their government policy -- will be possible also in
Iraq!'" In what follows, I shall propose and explore a different
foundation of and for the political, one that foregrounds the notion of
equality as the foundation for democracy, for égaliberté as an
unconditional democratic demand, one that sees the properly political as
a procedure that disrupts any given socio-spatial order, one that
addresses a 'wrong'. This 'wrong' is a condition in which the axiomatic
principle of equality is perverted through the institution of an order
that is always necessarily oligarchic. The proper political, therefore,
always operates at a certain distance from the state, but is aimed at
the transformation of the state (the police). Let me start with
considering Jacques Rancière's conceptualization of politics and the
political. For him, the space of the political has become sutured by
what he defines as the police (or policy) (Rancière 1998);(Rancière
1995). He explores whether the political can still be thought in an
environment in which a post-political consensual policy arrangement has
increasingly reduced the 'political' to 'policing', to 'policy-making',
to managerial consensual governing. Rancière distinguishes between 'the
police' (la police), 'the political' (le politique), and 'politics' (la
politique) (see also (Ricoeur 1965); (Lefort 2000)). The 'police' is
defined as the existing order of things and constitutes a certain
'partition of the sensible' (Rancière 2001: 8): the police refers to
"all the activities which create order by distributing places, names,
functions" (Rancière 1994: 173). This partition of the sensible "renders
visible who can be part of the common in function of what he does, of
the times and the space in which this activity is exercised ... This
defines the fact of being visible or not in a common space ... It is a
partitioning of times and spaces, of the visible and the invisible, of
voice and noise that defines both the place (location) and the arena of
the political as a form of experience" (Rancière 2000a: 13-14). The
police refers to both the activities of the state as well as to the
ordering of social relations and "... sees that those bodies are
assigned by name to a particular place and task; it is an order of the
visible and the sayable that sees that a particular activity is visible
and another is not, that this speech is understood as discourse and
another as noise" (Rancière 1998: 29). Indeed, as Dikec maintains, the
police "relies on a symbolically constituted organization of social
space, an organization that becomes the basis of and for governance.
Thus, the essence of policing is not repression but distribution --
distribution of places, peoples, names, functions, authorities,
activities and so on -- and the normalization of this distribution"
(Dikeç 2007: chapter 2, p. 5). It is a rule governing the appearance of
bodies, that configures a set of activities and occupations and arranges
the characteristics of the spaces where these activities are organized
or distributed (Rancière 1998: 29). The police order is predicated upon
saturation, upon suturing social space: "\[t\]he essence of the police
is the principle of saturation; it is a mode of the partition of the
sensible that recognizes neither lack nor supplement. As conceived by
'the police', society is a totality compromised of groups performing
specific functions and occupying determined spaces" (Rancière 2000c:
124). This drive to suturing is of course never realized. The
constitutive antagonisms that rupture society preempt saturation; there
will always be a constituted lack or surplus, that what is not accounted
for in the symbolic order of the police (Dikeç 2005). It is exactly this
lack or excess (the 'void' for (Badiou 2006)) that constitutes the
possibility of the political. **[[The political]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
then**[, [is about enunciating dissent and rupture, literally voicing
speech that claims a place in the order of things, demanding "the part
for those who have no-part]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Rancière 2001: 6).
The political is the arena in which Ochlos is turned into Demos, where
the anarchic noise of the rabble (the part that has no-part) is turned
into the recognized voice of the people, the spaces where that what is
only registered as noise by the police is turned into voice. In the
Nights of Labor, Rancière explores how the workers in 19th century
France, through carving out there times and spaces, became the political
subject under the name of the proletarian and, through this, claimed
their place in the police order (Rancière 1989**[). [Politics
is]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} therefore, **[[always
disruptive]{.mark}, it emerges with the "refusal to observe the 'place'
allocated to people and things]{.underline}** (or at least, to
particular people and things)" (Robson 2005: 5): it is the terrain where
the axiomatic principle of equality is tested in the face of a wrong
experienced by 'those who have no part'; a 'wrong' that is always
inherent in the oligarchic spaces of an instituted democratic polity. In
other words, equality is the very premise upon which a democratic
politics is constituted; the foundational gesture of democracy is
equality. It opens up the space of the political through the testing of
a wrong that subverts equality, a subversion that inheres in the
constituted 'forms' of democracy and, in an intensified way, in its
post- political guise. Rancière is here on the same terrain as Alain
Badiou: "\[E\]quality is not something to be researched or verified but
a principle to be upheld" (Hallward 2003a: 228). Emancipatory politics
emerge out of a fidelity to the democratic principle of equality; it is
the unconditional given of and for democracy. Equality is, consequently,
not some sort of utopian longing, but the very condition upon which the
democratic political is founded. The truth (in the sense of being true
or faithful to something) of democracy is its universalising foundation
on equality and the demand for justice, for a just politics. Etienne
Balibar (Balibar 1993) names this fusion of equality and liberty
'égaliberté', the former defined as the absence of discrimination and
the latter as absence of repression (Dikeç 2001). The very promise of
democracy, but which is always scandalously perverted, and therefore
necessitates its continuing reclamation, is founded on the
universalising and collective process of emancipation as égaliberté.
Indeed, freedom and equality can only be conquered: they are never
offered, granted or distributed.

notable. First, such [critical commentary is not]{.mark} typically
offered or [received as the]{.mark} [normal]{.mark}, proper
[activity]{.mark}]{.underline}** of a discipline or tradition, however
that discipline or tradition be defined. **[Such [commentary is]{.mark}
typically [encountered in a footnote]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} a
review essay, a contribution to the occasional symposium on the
discipline\'s future, a reading semi- nar, or the banter and sideplay of
professional conferences[. **[Rarely is it encountered as the main
theme]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**of a refereed journal article or a
formal research presentation at a professional meeting**.]{.underline}
In brief, [**such [commentary is offered as parenthesis. It is put forth
as a pause that]{.mark} is occasioned by the passing encounter with the
moment of dissidence and that [is bracketed and set off from the real
projects to which the commentators and their audiences are soon to
return]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Second, when critical comments such as
these are offered, they are typically pro- nounced in a cool, collected,
self-assured voice of an \"I\" or \"we\" that neither stum- bles nor
quavers with self-doubt. Sometimes, this posture of self-assurance takes
the form of nonchalance, even indifference, as if the commentary were
roughly compa- rable to a remark about the shrubbery overgrowing the
side of a highway one travels. An air of nonchalance is difficult to
sustain, however, when dissident events disturb a sense of direction or
when marginal works of thought pose questions that are diffi- cult to
ignore. On such occasions, equanimity often gives way to exasperation
tinged with embarrassment, a sense that it would be better if these
things did not have to be said, a regret that voices of
dissidence-though sometimes raising interesting ques- tions-are somehow
oblivious to the obvious things that truly refined scholars should
already know. On still other occasions, such as conversations between
teacher and student, when the addressee of these critical readings
cannot yet be presumed to be a mature member of the profession, an air
of cool detachment might be replaced by a tone of sobriety, even
solemnity, that reminds the potentially wayward novice that the reading
is a kind of vow that he, like all members, must earnestly recite. Yet
**[[all these reading postures]{.underline}]{.mark}**-nonchalance,
exasperation, solemnity during the rite of passage-[**have something in
common. As gestures in themselves, they at once** **[presuppose and
indicate the same location]{.mark}. [These postures indicate that such
critical remarks belong not at the center]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
discipline where its serious and productive work is proudly presented
and logically weighed, **[[but at its boundaries]{.underline},]{.mark}**
at its edges, at the thresholds or checkpoints of entry and exit.
**[[They indicate]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in the same stroke[**, [that
the discipline\'s]{.mark} territorial [boundaries are already
marked]{.mark}**,]{.underline} that the difference between outside and
inside is already given, and that the discipline, the tradition, the
\"everybody who knows and agrees with this reading\" is already
assuredly there.

# \*\*\*Framework

## 2NC FW Method First

#### Political method is a prior question to implementation---the impact is serial policy failure---our framework straight turns their political engagement arguments

[**Dillon and Reid 2K** (Michael and Julian, "Global Governance, Liberal
Peace, and Complex Emergency," Alternatives: Social Transformation &
Humane Governance, Jan-Mar 2000, Vol. 25, Issue 1, Ebsco)]{.underline}

As a precursor to global **[governance]{.underline}**, governmentality,
according to Foucault\'s initial account, poses the question of order
not in terms of the origin of the law and the location of sovereignty,
as do traditional accounts of power, but in terms instead of the
management of population. The management of population is further
refined in terms of specific problematics to which population management
may be reduced. These typically include but are not necessarily
exhausted by the following topoi of governmental power: economy, health,
welfare, poverty, security, sexuality, demographics, resources, skills,
culture, and so on. Now, [where there is an operation of power there is
knowledge]{.underline}, and where there is knowledge there is an
operation of power. Here discursive formations emerge and, as Foucault
noted, [**in every society**]{.underline} the production of [discourse
is]{.underline} at once [controlled, selected, organised and
redistributed by]{.underline} a certain number of
[procedures]{.underline} whose role is [to ward off its powers and
dangers]{.underline}, [to gain mastery over its chance events, to evade
its]{.underline} ponderous, formidable [materiality]{.underline}.\[34\]
More specifically, [where there is a policy problematic there is
expertise, **and where there is expertise**]{.underline} there, too,
**[a policy problematic will emerge]{.underline}**. [Such problematics
are detailed and elaborated in terms of **discrete forms of knowledge**
as well as **interlocking policy domains**]{.underline}. [[Policy
domains **reify the problematization of life**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
certain ways [[by turning]{.mark} these epistemically and politically
[contestable orderings of life into **\"problems\"** that
require]{.mark} the continuous [attention of]{.mark} policy science and
the continuous resolutions of [policymakers]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Policy \"actors\" develop]{.underline} and compete **[on the basis of
the expertise that grows up around such problems]{.underline}** or
clusters of problems [and their client populations]{.underline}. Here,
too, we may also discover what might be called \"epistemic
entrepreneurs.\" Albeit the market for discourse is prescribed and
policed in ways that Foucault indicated, bidding to formulate novel
problematizations they seek to \"sell\" these, or otherwise have them
officially adopted. In principle, [there is no limit to the ways in
which the management of population may be problematized]{.underline}.
All aspects of human conduct, any encounter with life, is
problematizable. [Any problematization is capable of becoming a policy
problem]{.underline}. [Governmentality]{.underline} thereby [creates a
market for policy]{.underline}, for science and for policy science, [in
which problematizations go looking for policy sponsors]{.underline}
while policy sponsors fiercely compete on behalf of their favored
problematizations. [[Reproblematization]{.mark} of problems [is
constrained by the]{.mark} institutional and ideological investments
surrounding accepted \"problems,\" and by the sheer **[difficulty of
challenging the inescapable ontological and epistemological assumptions
that go into their]{.mark} very [formation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There
is nothing so fiercely contested as an epistemological or ontological
assumption. And [there is nothing so fiercely ridiculed as the
suggestion that **[the real problem with problematizations]{.mark}
[exists]{.mark} precisely [at the level of]{.mark} such
[assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Such \"paralysis of analysis\" is
precisely what policymakers seek to avoid since they are compelled
constantly to respond to circumstances]{.underline} over which they
ordinarily have in fact both more and less control than they proclaim.
What [they do not have]{.underline} is precisely [the
control]{.underline} that [they want]{.underline}. Yet [serial policy
failure]{.underline}\--**[the fate and the fuel of all
policy]{.underline}**\--[compels them into a continuous search
for]{.underline} the [new analysis that]{.underline} will [extract them
from the aporias in which they **constantly find themselves
enmeshed**]{.underline}.\[35\] [Serial policy failure is no]{.underline}
simple [shortcoming that]{.underline} science and policy\--and [policy
science]{.underline}\--[will]{.underline} ultimately [overcome. Serial
policy [failure is rooted in the ontological and
epistemological]{.mark}]{.underline} [[assumptions that fashion the ways
in which global governance]{.mark} encounters and [problematizes
life]{.mark}]{.underline} as a process of emergence through fitness
landscapes that constantly adaptive and changing ensembles have
continuously to negotiate. As a particular kind of intervention into
life, [global governance promotes the]{.underline} very [changes
and]{.underline} unintended [outcomes that it **then serially
reproblematizes in terms of policy failure**]{.underline}. Thus, [global
liberal governance is not a linear problem-solving process committed to
the resolution of objective policy problems simply by bringing better
information and knowledge to bear upon them]{.underline}. [A nonlinear
economy of power/knowledge]{.underline}, [it deliberately installs
socially specific and radically inequitable distributions of
wealth]{.underline}, [opportunity, and mortal danger both locally and
globally through the very detailed ways in which life is
variously]{.underline} ([policy) problematized by it]{.underline}. In
consequence, [[thinking and acting politically is displaced by]{.mark}
the institutional and [epistemic rivalries]{.mark} that infuse its
power/ knowledge networks, and by the local conditions of application
that govern the introduction of their policies]{.underline}.
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[threaten to exhaust]{.mark} what
**[\"politics]{.mark}**,\"]{.underline} locally as well as globally, is
about.\[36\] It is here that the \"emergence\" characteristic of
governance begins to make its appearance. For [it is increasingly
recognized that there are no definitive policy solutions to objective,
neat, discrete policy problems]{.underline}. The \"subjects\" of policy
increasingly also become a matter of definition as well, since the
concept population does not have a stable referent either and has itself
also evolved in biophilosophical and biomolecular as well as Foucauldian
\"biopower\" ways.

## 2NC FW---AT Roleplaying

#### Role-playing causes passivity, tyranny and denies agency. 

[**Antonio '95** (Robert, University of Kansas, Nietzsche\'s
Antisociology: Subjectified Culture and the End of History American
Journal of Sociology, Vol. 101, No. 1 (Jul., 1995), pp. 1-43, JS)\*We
don't endorse gendered language]{.underline}

The \"problem of the actor,\" [Nietzsche]{.underline} said, \"troubled
me for the longest time.\"\'12 He [considered \"roles\" as \"external,\"
\"surface,\" or \"foreground\" phenomena and viewed close personal
identification with them as symptomatic of estrangement]{.underline}.
While modern theorists saw dif- ferentiated roles and professions as a
matrix of autonomy and reflexivity, [[Nietzsche held that
persons]{.mark}]{.underline} (especially male professionals) [in
[specialized occupations overidentify with their positions and engage
in]{.mark} gross [fabrica- tions to obtain advancement. They
look]{.mark} hesitantly [to the opinion of oth- ers, asking]{.mark}
themselves, \"[How ought I feel about this?\"]{.mark} **[They are
so]{.mark} thoroughly [absorbed in simulating effective role players
that they]{.mark} [have trouble being anything but
actors]{.mark}**]{.underline}-\"The role has actually become the
character.\" **[This highly subjectified social self or simulator
suffers devas- tating inauthenticity.]{.underline}** The powerful
authority given the social greatly amplifies Socratic culture\'s already
self-indulgent \"inwardness.\" Integ- rity, decisiveness, spontaneity,
and pleasure are undone by paralyzing overconcern about possible causes,
meanings, and consequences of acts and unending internal dialogue about
what others might think, expect, say, or do (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 83-86;
1986, pp. 39-40; 1974, pp. 302-4, 316-17). **[[Nervous rotation of
socially appropriate \"masks\" reduces persons to]{.mark} hypostatized
\"[shadows]{.mark},\" \"abstracts,\" or simulacra.]{.underline}** One
adopts \"many roles,\" playing them \"badly and superficially\" in the
fashion of a stiff \"puppet play.\" Nietzsche asked, \"Are you genuine?
Or only an actor? A representative or that which is represented? . . .
\[Or\] no more than an imitation of an actor?\" Simulation is so
pervasive that it is hard to tell the copy from the genuine article;
social selves \"prefer the copies to the originals\" (Nietzsche 1983,
pp. 84-86; 1986, p. 136; 1974, pp. 232- 33, 259; 1969b, pp. 268, 300,
302; 1968a, pp. 26-27). [[Their inwardnes]{.mark}s and aleatory scripts
[foreclose genuine attachment to others.]{.mark} This type of actor
cannot plan for the long term or participate in enduring net- works of
interdependence]{.underline}; such a person is neither willing nor able
to be a \"stone\" in the societal \"edifice\" (Nietzsche 1974, pp.
302-4; 1986a, pp. 93-94). Superficiality rules in the arid subjectivized
landscape. Neitzsche (1974, p. 259) stated, \"One thinks with a watch in
one\'s hand, even as one eats one\'s midday meal while reading the
latest news of the stock market; one lives as if one always \'might miss
out on something. \'\'Rather do anything than nothing\': this principle,
too, is merely a string to throttle all culture. . . . [[Living in a
constant chase after gain compels people to expend their spirit to the
point of exhaustion]{.mark} in continual pretense and overreaching and
[anticipating others]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" [Pervasive leveling,
improvising, and faking foster an inflated sense of ability and an
oblivious attitude about the fortuitous circumstances that contribute to
role attainment]{.underline} (e.g., class or ethnicity). The most medio-
cre people believe they can fill any position, even cultural leadership.
Nietzsche respected the self-mastery of genuine ascetic priests, like
Socra- tes, and praised their ability to redirect ressentiment
creatively and to render the \"sick\" harmless. But he deeply feared the
new simulated versions. Lacking the \"born physician\'s\" capacities,
these impostors am- plify the worst inclinations of the herd; they are
\"violent, envious, ex- ploitative, scheming, fawning, cringing,
arrogant, all according to cir- cumstances. \" Social selves are fodder
for the \"great man of the masses.\" [Nietzsche held that \"[the less
one knows how to command, the more ur- gently one covets someone who
commands]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} who commands severely- a god,
prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience.
[[The deadly combination of desperate conforming and]{.mark}
overreaching and untrammeled [ressentiment **paves the way for a new
type of tyrant**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Nietzsche 1986, pp. 137, 168;
1974, pp. 117-18, 213, 288-89, 303-4).

## 2NC FW---AT Policy Relevance

#### That's not how policymaking happens -- the Aff ignores the social power dynamics of how scholarship is produced and appropriated by policy makers. 

**[Eriksson 2014]{.underline}** (Johan, Swedish Institute of
International Affairs, "On the Policy Relevance of Grand Theory,"
*International Studies Perspectives*, 15.1,
https://www.academia.edu/12626547/On_the_Policy_Relevance_of_Grand_Theory,
accessed 7-14-2019, GDI-ATN)

I find **[[the traditional understanding of policy-relevant
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline}** problematic in three particular ways.
First, it **[[conveys an idealized]{.mark} rationalist--instrumentalist
[perspective on the policy process]{.mark}, ignoring wider political and
symbolic aspects of policy]{.underline}**---on which I will elaborate
later. In this rationalist-instrumentalist view, scholarship is produced
and screened through peer review to make sure only that which meets
scientific standards of logical consistency and explanatory power gets
published. Then, in the best of situations, relevant scholarship is
communicated to policymakers in dire need of scientific knowledge for
effectively managing real-world problems---be it war, terrorism,
organized crime, famine, or other such major issues. **[This notion of
"speaking truth to power" expresses a strong belief in the enlightenment
function of scholarship and implies a traditional fact/value
distinction]{.underline}**. **[In reality, the relationship between
theory and policy is much more complicated]{.underline}**, as experts
cannot deny responsibility for how their ideas are being used (the
nuclear bomb), and because the politicization of research can imply a
threat to intellectual integrity (Wildavsky 1987; Fischer 1990; Jasanoff
1997). Moreover, **[there are many other ideas, values, and interests
besides scientific theory and research, which influence
policymaking]{.underline}** (Weiss 1977, 1980, 1992; George 1993; Smith
1996; Jasanoff 1997). **[Generally speaking, the [utilization of
scholarship in policymaking is]{.mark} indirect, limited, and
[rare]{.mark}]{.underline}** (George 1993:xvii--xx; Rosenau and Sapin
1994:127--129). Second, and related to the first point, **[the
traditional perspective on policy relevance assumes a sender--receiver
perspective: university professors are supposedly "speaking truth" to
government officials]{.underline}**, who are or should be using this
scholarly input in their formulation of policies. This prevailing
perspective is understandable given the feeling among many IR scholars
that practitioners pay little or no attention to what we have to say
(George 1993; Wallace 1996; Walt 2005:42; Nye 2008a,b). Yet the
distinction between senders and receivers is problematic. **[It suggests
that communication is one-directional, that only "truth" is communicated
to "power,"]{.underline}** and that there are only two types of actors
involved. **[What about practitioners trying to influence what scholars
say and do ---through, for example, prioritizing certain issues above
others in research funding]{.underline}**? Steve Smith argues that
**[[policymakers tend to utilize scholarship when it confirms what they
already believe]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Smith 1997, 2008). When this is
the case, **[[scholars talking to practitioners are echoing "truths"
already settled by practitioners]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Furthermore,
the sender--receiver perspective ignores how both knowledge and policies
are produced in complex contexts and processes, which involve a number
of different types of actors and advocacy coalitions, with often diffuse
and multidirectional patterns of influence. **[Ideas expressed by
scholars reflect and interact with a larger societal context, which
includes but is not limited to public policymaking]{.underline}** (Buger
and Gadinger 2007:95). Moreover, the very € distinction between scholars
and practitioners is sometimes blurred. Some individuals are
"in-and-outers" (Rosenau and Sapin 1994) going back and forth between,
for example, a university position and government assignments or other
political positions, such as being members of parliament. **[Within the
world of think tanks, individuals simultaneously play a number of
roles---as academic experts, as journalists, as policy advocates, and
occasionally as policy shapers and decision makers
themselves]{.underline}** (Rich 2004). As argued by Lisa Anderson,
universities can no longer claim monopoly of scientific (or
methodologically rigorous) production of knowledge (Anderson 2003).
Think tanks, NGOs, new2 and traditional media organizations, social
science corporations, and governmental in-house units of research and
analysis produce knowledge and input for policy sometimes competing
with, sometimes replacing, that which university researchers produce.
Knowledge as well as public policy is formed through epistemic
communities and networks of advocacy coalitions, which are blurring the
boundaries between scholars and practitioners, academia and policy, and
truth and power. Third, the traditional conception of policy relevance
confuses relevance with improvement. If only politicians would read and
appreciate "the best" IR middlerange theories on topics on political
agendas, policies would be greatly improved, and by implication, so
would the world (cf. Groom 1984; Wallace 1996; Lepgold and Nincic 2000;
Walt 2005; Nye 2008a,b; Jentleson and Ratner 2011:8). This view partly
stems from an irritation with the perceived ignorance of policy
relevance in large parts of the IR community, and partly from a sense of
intellectual superiority. Arguably, this view conveys a skewed account
of both theory and the policy process. To make the point clear, **[it
cannot be assumed that influential scholarship necessarily makes policy
"better"]{.underline}** or that high-quality research always has a
better chance of influencing policy than sloppy research or ideas that
build on faulty or even false premises. Perhaps, **[[it is not]{.mark}
always [the academically most acclaimed theories that gain the attention
of policymakers]{.mark}, but rather those that provide the most simple,
elegant, and accessible worldviews and solutions to problems which are
in fact extremely complex]{.underline}**. How else is it possible that
ideas which are rhetorically elegant yet academically bashed, such as
Huntington's "clash of civilizations," can gain significant political
attention? In the words of Peter Gourevitch (1989:87--88): **["[Even a
good idea cannot become policy if it meets certain kinds of opposition,
and a bad idea can become policy if it is able to obtain
support."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### No direct correspondence between policy scholarship and policy relevance, but critiques do have policy relevance because they influence the larger cultural context framing knowledge

**[Eriksson 2014]{.underline}** (Johan, Swedish Institute of
International Affairs, "On the Policy Relevance of Grand Theory,"
*International Studies Perspectives*, 15.1,
https://www.academia.edu/12626547/On_the_Policy_Relevance_of_Grand_Theory,
accessed 7-14-2019, GDI-ATN)

Moreover, and more importantly for the purpose of this paper, it can be
argued that **[these "great debates" have not been isolated affairs
within the ivory tower, but have also reflected paradigms in foreign
policy and world affairs]{.underline}**. This is perhaps most clearly
the case with the first debate between Realism and Utopianism, which was
explicitly concerned with how the West should deal with Nazi Germany.
Yet, it can also been argued that "grand theory" has continued to shape
policy. US foreign policy, for example, is commonly described in terms
of a balancing of two main grand theories---on the one hand Realism and
its emphasis on "hard power" in military and economic terms, and on the
other Liberalism and its emphasis on "soft power," multilateralism, and
the diffusion of democratic norms and institutions.4 Some scholars
turned practitioners, such as Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski,
have embraced a particular grand theory (in this case Realism, in its
classical and geostrategic variant), as a theoretical and conceptual
guide for their politics (Schwartz 2011; Brzezinski 2012). Likewise, the
US postwar containment policy essentially reflected Realist geopolitical
ideas---using military and economic means to "contain" the Soviet Union.
Moreover, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, established by the
UN General Assembly in 1948, clearly reflects fundamentally Liberal
ideas. Even beyond such perhaps more "obvious" cases of grand theory
turned into policy, we should consider Keynes observation of how
**[[grand ideas and theories]{.mark}, including ideologies and religious
worldviews, [shape policy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Importantly, **[grand
theories and grand ideas shaping policy should not be equated with
scholars or scholarship shaping policy.]{.underline}** As noted earlier,
[**[the relationship between scholarship and policy is a complicated
one, and the assumption of a simple sender--receiver relationship is far
too limited]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[[Scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and statesmen, as well as **[journalists, analysts, bureaucrats,
business leaders, [political activists, and others participate and
contribute to a political discourse in which ideas and policies are
formulated, critiqued, reshaped]{.mark}, and occasionally
implemented.]{.underline}** Inspired by John Kingdon and his theory of
the agenda-setting process in public policy, I argue that a "garbage
can"5 approach gives a more realistic understanding of the production of
policy than the sender--receiver perspective. **[[Ideas are "floating
around" in the "policy soup"]{.mark} as well as in
academia]{.underline}**. Rather than tracing the origin or originator of
an idea or a particular policy, which will only lead to "infinite
regress" (Kingdon 1995:72--73), **[focus should be on who is advocating
a particular idea, who resists it, and what determines how the policy
agenda is shaped.]{.underline}**6 Some observers lament that many useful
scholarly ideas are ignored: That there is a gap between scholarship and
policy in terms of direct communication and explicit exchange of ideas
and people (George 1993)---a gap that arguably has tended to grow
(Wallace 1996; Walt 2005; Nau 2008:636; Nye 2008a,b). Critics argue that
this "gap" is exaggerated or simply, they claim scholars and
policymakers tend to be likeminded and guided by similar paradigmatic
views of how the world hangs together (Buger and Gadinger 2007; Smith
2008; Jones 2009). € These critics also claim that the distinction
between objective scholarship (truth) and subjective politics (power) is
overstated---arguing that teaching and research are unavoidably
normative and very much concerned with real-world issues. Likewise,
critics argue that the policy world is not only exercising power but
also developing ideas, understanding, knowledge, and explanation, albeit
not necessarily according to scientific principles (Smith 2008). Thus,
it is essential to make a clear distinction between direct communication
and exchange on the one hand and paradigmatic community on the other.
**[[There is clearly a gap in direct communication]{.mark} and exchange
[between scholarship and policy]{.mark}, and in a general sense, this
may be growing, although patterns are not everywhere the same. [Yet
scholars]{.mark} and practitioners often s[hare paradigmatic views on
the world]{.mark}, largely reflecting positions taken by some grand
theory.]{.underline}**

#### Virtually no direct connection between policy scholarship and policy changes

**[Bertucci et al 2014]{.underline}** (Mariano, \[fellow @ Center for
Inter-American Policy and Research @ Tulane University\], Fabián
Borges-Herrero \[Assistant Professor of Political Science at CSUSB\],
Claudia Fuentes-Julio \[faculty @ institute of international relations @
Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro\], Toward "Best
Practices" in Scholar--Practitioner Relations: Insights from the Field
of Inter-American Affairs, *International Studies Perspectives*, 15.1,
accessed 7-15-2019, GDI-ATN)

**[[The likelihood that scholarly ideas will influence]{.mark} the
[policy]{.mark} process [may be inversely proportional to the
politicization of the issue]{.mark}]{.underline}** at play. U.S.
policies on illegal drug trade, Cuba, and immigration, illustrate this
paradox (Shifter 2011:2). There is widespread consensus in both academic
and policy circles that U.S. policy is failing in these areas, but
policymakers have not been receptive to new ideas from scholars aimed at
addressing these failures.18 **[The complex nature of policy-making
processes calls for "aligning-stars" in order for expert knowledge
actually to influence policymaking. The outputs of policy-making
processes depend on at least three streams and two factors that are only
marginally, if at all, directly influenced by scholarly
knowledge]{.underline}**. The three policy streams flow relatively
independently from each other and are as follows: (i) "problem
recognition", or the process through which a given condition (e.g., lack
of peace in the Middle East) is transformed into a national security
problem of a given country; (ii) "policy alternatives", or the process
through which alternative courses of action are generated in academic
and nonacademic circles (e.g., bureaucracy vs. scholars working in think
tanks, nongovernmental organizations); and (iii) "politics", or "the
national mood, interest groups campaigns, and administrative or
legislative turnover" that may or not provide a functional environment
for the implementation of available policy alternatives. Added to these,
the two main factors that could bring the streams together and open the
"window of opportunity" for available policy alternatives to influence
policy are individual efforts made by politicians or policy
entrepreneurs, or crises such as 9/11. That is, **[[policy-making
processes are like "garbage cans" of decision making]{.mark} in which
policy outcomes are the result of individual actors attaching available
policy solutions to existing problems, whereas scholarly inputs are only
one among five processes and factors that may facilitate or impede the
influence of scholarly knowledge on practice]{.underline}** (Krasner
2009:261). Examples in Costa Rica, Mexico, and Argentina illustrate this
point. During Oscar Arias' presidency in Costa Rica, half the cabinet
had PhD degrees, but **[[given the dysfunctional institutional design of
the state]{.underline}]{.mark}** (i.e., legislative minorities hold
substantial veto power over policymaking due to Congressional by laws),
**[[it was virtually impossible to bring about policy
change]{.mark}.]{.underline}**19 In Mexico, receptiveness of
policymakers to scholarly ideas tends to fluctuate depending on who is
occupying the presidency. Whereas a relatively close relationship
between Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) governments and the
Instituto Tecnolo´gico Auto´nomo de Me´xico (ITAM) existed during the
1980s and 1990s, the Partido Accio´n Nacional's (PAN) administration of
Vicente Fox has had something of an anti-academic bent. However, during
the PAN's government of Felipe Caldero´n, there has been a significant
interaction between scholars and policymakers, as well as a few
scholars-cum-practitioners occupying top-level government positions
(e.g., Alejandro Poire´ as Secretary of the Interior and Rafael
Ferna´ndez de Castro as Presidential Advisor for International
Affairs).20 Argentina's foreign policy-making process has historically
been highly centralized in the hands of a very few political actors,
mainly the president. Scholars do not circulate in and out of government
and academia, even though Argentine scholars tend to tackle the most
pressing issues of Argentina's international agenda (Russell 2011).
Indeed, and in sharp contrast to United States-based IR scholarship,
Latin America's research in IR has traditionally produced relevant and
applicable policy knowledge in a language accessible to policymakers.
The incentive structure of academia in the region has rewarded
non-theoretical knowledge and theory has often been seen as irrelevant
in light of the region's pressing concerns. Whether
scholar--practitioner interactions take place varies in different
domestic and historical circumstances (Tickner 2011). For example,
scholars have been influential in Chile's foreign policy-making process,
but not in Brazil, where Itamaraty---Brazil's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs---has not only dominated that country's foreign policy
decision-making apparatus but also the production of Brazilian IR
scholarship (De Souza 2011).21 **[The ability of scholarship to
influence policy also depends on the pace at which policymaking takes
place in different issue areas. [The potential for scholarly influence
is limited in policy areas with short time horizons, as in the case of
day-to-day diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is greater in areas with
long-term horizons, such as development policy, where scholars have
successfully introduced new ideas aimed at empowering women and reducing
extreme poverty, as discussed above (Heredia 2012; Lustig 2012).

## 2NC FW---Discourse Key

#### Discourse establishes the parameters for thought and decision-making -- critique is a prerequisite to effective policy

In Bosnia's conflict, Fierke identifies "interfacing games."28 Two
dominant speech acts, a narrative of "threat" and another of "promise,"
were juxtaposed (interfaced). Both were the product of the Western
actors' analysis of the conflict and of their interactions.29 Several
Western actors (the US, the European Union) mobilized rhetorics of
threat vis-a\`-vis the local agents involved in the conflict (Bosnians,
Serbs, or others) while, at the same time, other Western actors turned
to a rhetoric of promise (the UN, for example). These **[interfacing
speech acts, although contradictory, were simultaneously deployed and
gave rise to different political responses and expectations (on the part
of local actors, Western interventionists, and the international
community)]{.underline}**.30 Furthermore, as the speech acts evolved
through contact with other speech acts, these interfacing games did not
remain constant either. The language games underwent some
transformations as every actor situated within the Bosnian context
reacted to these language productions with their own games (the Bosnian
Serbs turned to "blocking," "shelling" and "hijacking"). As a reply to
these reactions, the initially interfaced games turned to the rhetorical
deployment of new deeds, such as "appeasement" and "concession" on the
part of the UN for example.31 Fierke's essay is a successful
**[constructivist analysis of language]{.underline}** made to fit the
requirements of a specific international political situation. In the
course of her study, she **[mobilizes]{.underline}** notions which are
proper to constructivism: **[language games, rules, deeds, and speech
acts]{.underline}**. Fierke does not use these notions haphazardly but,
on the contrary, with clear critical intent. What such concepts allow
her to accomplish is a rejection of **[structural realist
models]{.underline}** which often **[come up with predetermined
explanations of political situations even before these situations have a
chance to unfold]{.underline}**. Still, for a constructivist, such a
rejection is not a sufficient exercise. As indicated earlier, the
critical work needs to be accompanied by a reconstructive enterprise.
Fierke's article exemplifies this reconstructive task when she intimates
that an alternative way of patterning international relations can be
deployed.32 What an emphasis on language rules does is show how
contradictory speech acts can be made less contradictory once the rules,
norms, and patterns governing their production are clarified. Once
actors are made to realize what their words are about, and that other
actors' words and deeds operate according to similar patterns, a
bridging of the gap between speech acts can be envisioned. At this
point, normative possibilities, that is to say, the ability to identify
patterns of social actions based on common language rules, take over the
constructivist analysis. What is also implicit in Fierke's attempt at
"repatterning" IR is the idea that knowledge about social relations can
still be meaningfully acquired. In Fierke's words, knowledge is what
allows the postmodern scholar to "go on." **[The rules of language and
the emphasis on speech acts "establish the parameters for knowing 'how
to go on'.]{.underline}**"33 **[What language constitutes is the
possibility for knowledge about the world to be gathered, albeit in a
different]{.underline}**, non-positivist, **[and more contextual
fashion.]{.underline}**

#### Discursive framing of international politics fabricates the conditions by which particular courses of action become thinkable and necessary

**[Debrix 2002]{.underline}** \[Francois, professor of political science
@ Virginia Tech specializing in critical geopolitics, "Language as
Criticism: Assessing the Merits of Speech Acts and Discursive Formations
in International Relations." *New Political Science* 24.2, GDI-ATN\]

The entire April 2001 diplomatic standoff between the US and China is a
**[discursive formation,]{.underline}** a performance of language, which
**[manipulates the notion of "crisis" in order to bring]{.underline}**
(out of the initial incident) **[political advantages and desirable
ideological outcomes]{.underline}** to both parties. Both China and the
US partake of the discourse which creates the "crisis." The discursive
production of this "crisis" takes place through the deployment of
linguistic terms and devices which evoke the idea that a severe
confrontation between both countries can happen at any moment. The very
use of the term "crisis" (and related terms) by both governments
connotes this sense of urgency. More than the word crisis or any of its
derivatives (critical situation, stalemate, confrontation, etc.) though,
**[the general rhetoric used to explain the situation (national defense
tropes), the timing of the exchanges (verbal tit-for-tats), additional
texts inserted in the exchange (having victims write letters begging to
resolve the "crisis"), and the cast of characters discursively mobilized
(the dead pilot, the US crew in "custody" on the island, and the authors
and translators of the final apology) are what make up the linguistic
and performative "substance" of this "crisis."]{.underline}** From a
poststructuralist perspective, the linguistic performance begins at the
moment when the discursive credibility of the "crisis" is made to depend
upon its association with the notion of an "apology."68 The contested
meaning of the term "apology" between both nations guarantees that a
standoff will take place. Indeed, when the US refuse to "apologize" for
the collision and the landing, the "crisis" is initiated. The Chinese
will not release the crew, the tensions will be exacerbated. Similarly,
by demanding an "apology," Jiang's regime anticipates that the response
by the US will be a negative one. The possibility of a diplomatic
opening is foreclosed. From the moment this foreclosure is established,
the "crisis" and its succession of events are strictly self-referential.
Self-referential means that the signification of these events is the
product of other discursively produced situations in the "crisis." The
linguistic performance upon which the discursive formation of the
"crisis" relies establishes a semblance of dilemma: if nobody takes
responsibility and words an "apology," how can the "crisis" be averted?
Yet, slowly but surely, the term "apology" is manipulated to the point
where, finally, its meaning is disentangled from that of "crisis."
First, "apology" slides from full responsibility to expressions of
regret and/or dialogue. 69 Clearly, regret and dialogue only make sense
in relation to the intransigent meaning of "apology" established by the
previous discursive context. Continuing on this discursive slide, the
term "apology" is then worded by new characters (the dead pilot's wife,
Bush himself) and located in novel linguistic contexts (letters) within
which the initially intransigent meaning of the term becomes much more
ambiguous (is "very sorry" a full apology?). A poststructuralist reading
of the standoff thus presents the "crisis" as a succession of
complementary stages through which linguistic manipulations, rhetorical
maneuvers and supplementary meanings are performed. Once these are
performed, the discursive formation of a "crisis" is established.
Similar to what Doty found in the attitude of the US vis-a\`-vis the
Philippines, the discursive formation of the US--China "crisis"
facilitates certain representations (of self and other) which clearly
serve both countries' political interests. By deploying a "crisis" that
they will be able to solve, the United States (particularly its
president) show that they are in control of international affairs and
that no other country, not even China, will dictate America's foreign
policy in the new century. In a sense, **[through the discursive
fabrication of this "crisis," American national interest and
international political supremacy (two traditionally realist concepts)
are reinforced. But the discursively produced "crisis" brings political
advantages to China too. China uses the management of this "crisis" to
remind foreign nations that it is sovereign and independent despite its
growing interdependence vis-a\`-vis other world economies and financial
markets. Not even a "threat" to China's economic growth can sway Jiang's
regime when it boils down to China's independence.]{.underline}**70
Unlike constructivism, a poststructuralist reading underscores the view
that language matters, but not because it creates social norms or rules
of behavior generalizable to political relations. Rather, **[language
matters because it fabricates strictly discursive conditions and
situations which nonetheless give rise to and support certain political
realities. These representations of language (including the norms of
social behavior discovered by constructivists) do not have to be
substantiated by material realities to yield powerful
effects]{.underline}**. Their point of reference, rather, is strictly
linguistic. Thus, according to a poststructuralist analysis, it was
inevitable for a "crisis" to take place between China and the United
States, not because of the initial collision between the planes, but
because the political outcomes of such a "crisis," if played out
correctly, would be desirable to both countries. From such a critical
perspective, there is no reason to believe (unlike constructivism) that
such a linguistic play would necessarily modify the actors' perceptions
of one another. The discursive formation did not have to transform the
agents' behaviors to be successful.

## Security/Fear

### Link---Security---1NC 

#### Appeal to security generates a political subject that must eradicate all difference which threatens rational thought. 

[**Campbell & Dillon 93** \[David, Honorary Professor of Political
Science and International Studies at the Univ of Queensland, Michael,
Emeritus Prof of Politics, Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster Univ,
"The end of philosophy and the end of international relations," The
Political Subject of Violence, pp. 29-30\]]{.underline}

As violence is the ultima ratio of politics, so [security is the
foundational value around which the political subject of violence
revolves; from which it derives its teleological structure; and to which
it constantly appeals in legitimation of its ordering way.
Security]{.underline}, then, [as it orders and informs the political
discourses of modernity, is the vehicle by which the ethic of technology
is discreetly conveyed in modern politics. From that ethic derives the
characteristic way in which the politics of security makes political
order present in specific material conditions of social
existence]{.underline}. Subject to scrutiny from within the interpretive
frame of the end of philosophy, it turns out, however, that [**[security
is]{.mark}** more than a mere goal]{.underline}, even the chief goal,
[of the rationally ordered means-ends calculus which defines the
political subject of violence. It **[is]{.mark}**, rather, [**the
generative**]{.mark} and immanent principle of **[formation of]{.mark}**
that **[political subject. To bring security into question]{.mark}**,
therefore, is to bring the entire axiomatic foundation and architecture
of this political construction into question]{.underline}. In the
process, [that questioning further [**problematises the foundation
of**]{.mark} epistemic [**realism which underpins**]{.mark} the
intellectual [**discourses which**]{.mark} claim to account for and
**[speak the truth about the political subject of violence]{.mark}**;
notably the discipline of international relations, [**whose**]{.mark}
disciplinary [**response to this un-securing**]{.mark} of its own
boundaries [**has**]{.mark} naturally **[been to elicit]{.mark}**, from
the grip of epistemic realism in which it seeks to fasten itself ever
more strongly, **[more security against its new enemies]{.mark}**. It is
security, then, which furnishes the foundation of the modern political
subject]{.underline}; which subject is the political subject of
violence. [Security is **[the condition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, better
to say state (in order to allow the play of this word to do further work
for us), [[**which**]{.mark} that subject [**is**]{.mark} ostensibly
[**driven to seek for itself**]{.mark} and, in pursuing its own
**[security]{.mark}**, seek **[to deny to its
enemy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The politics of security has, therefore,
to be summoned before the end of philosophy thesis also, and it is
precisely that task which James Der Derian\'s chapter - \'The value of
security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard\'- commences. \"The
goal of this inquiry\', he notes, \'is to make philosophically
problematical what has been practically axiomatic in international
relations.' Adopting a Nietzschean voice, he begins by arguing that the
first step is to ask, 'whether the paramount value of security lies in
its abnegation of the insecurity of all values'. Der Derian proceeds by
offering a \'tentative and preliminary\' genealogy of security;
designed, as all genealogies are, to stimulate our appreciation of \'the
discursive power of the concept, to remember its forgotten meanings,
\[and\] to assess its economy of use in the present\'. He begins by
observing, first, that 'within the concept of security lurks the entire
history of Western metaphysics\'. This marks the extent of its
discursive register. He, therefore, commends Derrida\'s description of
onto-theological thought -\'as a series of substitutions of center for
center\' in a perpetual search to locate a secure \'transcendental
signified\' - as an equally accurate description of the politics of
security as well. [The political subject of violence, rapaciously
invoking security, comes in a variety of]{.underline} guises, however,
[depending upon where its particular idiomatic expression happens to
locate the centre]{.underline}: God; rational subject; nation; state;
people; class; race \... [The very plurality of candidates indicates
what we already experience phenomenologically. **[There is no secure
centre]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Metaphysically, therefore, [[**the enemy
is that**]{.mark} very uncertainty [**which causes**]{.mark} the
**[doubt]{.mark}**]{.underline}, of which Caygill tells, [[**that the
rational subject**]{.mark} of both thought and politics **[was designed
to dispel]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a metaphysically determined
conception of the political and form of political order, [modernity\'s
politics of security must, therefore, also always have uncertainty as
its generic enemy]{.underline}. This is what Der Derian means when he
indicates, following Nietzsche, that [the paramount value of security is
its abnegation of the insecurity of all values]{.underline}**. [[The
enemy of]{.underline}]{.mark}** []{.mark}[the politics of [**security
is**]{.mark} the very heterogeneity, [**difference**]{.mark} and
otherness]{.underline} - in Levinasian terms, [radical alterity [**that
cannot**]{.mark} and will not [**be assimilated into rational
thought**]{.mark} or practice [**because it**]{.mark} simply
[**always**]{.mark} exceeds their categories - that [**threatens
the**]{.mark} knowledgeably- [**secure self-possession**]{.mark} which
is the ideal of the sovereign subject]{.underline}. With the dissolution
of the Soviet empire and the total effacement of the face of the
post-war enemy of the Western powers, that is precisely what their
leaders have admitted. [The enemy of political modernity is uncertainty
and contingency itself]{.underline}.

#### Transforms the ambiguity of life into a quest for truth and rationality---domesticates life 

[**Der Derian 93** \[James, "The value of security: Hobbes, Marx,
Nietzsche, and Baudrillard," The Political Subject of Violence, pp.
102-105\]]{.underline}

[The desire for [**security is**]{.mark} manifested as **[a collective
resentment of]{.mark}** difference [**that which is not**]{.mark} us,
not certain, not **[predictable]{.mark}**. Complicit with a negative
will to power is the fear-driven desire for protection from the unknown.
Unlike the positive will to power which produces an aesthetic
affirmation of difference, **[the search for truth produces a truncated
life which conforms to the rationally knowable]{.mark}**, to the
causally sustainable]{.underline}. In The Gay Science Nietzsche asks of
the reader: Look, isn\'t [our need for knowledge precisely this need for
the familiar, the will to uncover everything strange, unusual, and
questionable, something that no longer disturbs us? Is it not the
instinct of fear that bids us to know? And is the jubilation of those
who obtain knowledge not the jubilation over the restoration of a sense
of security?\"]{.underline} [**The [fear of the unknown and]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}the [**desire for certainty**]{.mark} combine to **[produce a
domesticated life, in which causality and rationality become
the]{.mark}** highest sign of a sovereign self, the [**surest
protection**]{.mark} against contingent forces]{.underline}. The fear of
fate assures a belief that everything reasonable is true, and everything
true reasonable. In short, [the security imperative produces and is
sustained by the strategies of knowledge which seek to explain
it]{.underline}. Nietzsche elucidates the nature of this generative
relationship in The Twilight of the Idols: [A safe life requires safe
truths. The strange and the alien remain unexamined, [**the unknown
becomes**]{.mark} identified as **[evil]{.mark}**, and evil provokes
hostility - **[recycling the desire for security]{.mark}**. The
\'influence of timidity,]{.underline}\' as Nietzsche puts it,
[**creates** a **people** who are **willing to subordinate** affirmative
**values to the \'necessities\' of security**: \'they fear change,
transitoriness: this expresses a straitened soul, full of mistrust and
evil experiences\']{.underline}.\"The point of Nietzsche\'s critical
genealogy is to show the [perilous conditions which created the security
imperative]{.underline} - and the western metaphysics which perpetuate
it - [have diminished if not disappeared; yet the fear of life
persists]{.underline}: \'Our century denies this perilousness, and does
so with a good conscience: and yet it continues to drag along with it
the old habits of Christian security, Christian enjoyment, recreation
and evaluation.\" Nietzsche\'s worry is that [the collective reaction
against older, more primal fears has created an even worse danger: the
tyranny of the herd]{.underline}, the lowering of man, the apathy of the
last man [which controls through conformity and rules through passivity.
The [**security**]{.mark} of the sovereign, rational self and state
**[comes at the cost of ambiguity, uncertainty, paradox - all that makes
life worthwhile]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nietzsche\'s lament for this
lost life is captured at the end of Daybreak in a series of rhetorical
questions:

### Link---Resilience---1NC

#### Resilience is the internalization of catastrophe as the never-ending condition of existence -- violence is normalized as we absorb the very conditions of our annihilation. This imagery of the subject-under-siege empties out the value to life and produces a nihilistic hatred for the world that explodes in ever more violence.

**[Evans and Reid 14]{.underline}** \[Brad Evans, professor of
international relations at the University of Lapland, Finland and Julian
Reid, senior lecturer in international relations at the University of
Bristol, Resilient Life, 2014, pg. 110\]

**[Anybody who has experienced immunization will appreciate the violence
of the encounter. The whole process begins with the awareness of some
vaguely looming threat which promises in the worst case an extremely
violent ending]{.underline}**. **[To pre-empt this happening, the
subject is physically penetrated by the alien body with a controlled
level of the lethal substance which, although producing violent
sickness, is a fate less than death]{.underline}**. **[Such violence
unto oneself offers to counter violence with violence such that life may
carry on living in spite of the dangers we are incapable of securing
ourselves against]{.underline}**. **[It is to give over to a form of
self-harm albeit in a way that is actively desired and positively
conceived]{.underline}**. How else may we live otherwise?
**[[Resilience]{.mark} follows a similar logic]{.underline}**. **[It
[encourages that we partake in the violence of the world to keep death
at bay]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[For in the process of
learning to live through the insecurity of the times, [the subject is
asked to incorporate the catastrophic]{.mark} intellectually, viscerally
and affectively]{.underline}**, thereby **[providing certain
immunization against a more endangering fate]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[[since the ultimate litmus test is]{.mark} to bring to question [the
worst case scenario, the future cannot appear]{.mark} to us [as anything
other than]{.mark} completely
[monstrous]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[What]{.underline}**,
however, **[is actually slain as the future is wagered by the violence
of the present may only become revealed with the passage of
time]{.underline}**. [**[None of this operates outside of the realm of
power politics]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[We only have to consider here
(a) the moral judgements and political stakes associated with HIV as a
pandemic that is more than simply biological, and (b) the development of
viral analogies to explain more generally the problems 'infecting'
societies from terror to criminality to evidence the
point]{.underline}**. **[Immunization is precisely about exposing
oneself to something that is potentially lethal, thereby raising the
thresh- old level for existence such that [violence is normalized on
account of our vulnerabilities to that which may be tempered but remains
undefeatable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We are drawn here to Stellan Rye's
(1913) silent horror movie The Student from Prague (Der Student von
Prag) which has inspired a number of compelling literary and cinematic
classics. In this tragic tale of poverty and vio- lence, the
impoverished student, Balduin, makes a bargain with the Devil as he
exchanges the reflection of image for more immediate compensations. Upon
eventually seeing himself, however, the student is avenged by an angry
double that begins to wreak havoc as it seeks out revenge in light of
its betrayal. Following an eventual violent con- frontation the student
has with his double, Balduin shat- ters the mirror that is central to
the plot, and invariably destroys the fantasy of endangerment which also
became the source of his afflicted curse. Inevitably, however, since the
double was an essential element of this Faustian agree- ment, in killing
the violent double, so the student kills himself. Otto Rank famously
related this to the narcissistic self whose very sense of loneliness and
alienation is caused by an anguish of a fear of death; even though it is
precisely the violence of the pact which pushes the subject further
towards the precipice. Whilst it is tempting to read this in familiar
dialectical terms, there is a more sophisticated double move at work
here, as the violence is already encoded within the initial act of
demonic violation before the tragic encounter. For the double merely
highlights the self-propelling tendency, from the fantasy of
endangerment to the reality of the catastrophic. There is also a
semantic interchange at work in Rye's Doppelganger as it stakes out the
choice between a violated/violent life and eventual death. Since reason
or logic prove utterly incapable of explaining the condition of
Balduin's existence, let alone offering any promise of salvation from
the oppressive situ- ation to which he is fatefully bound, the double
serves as an important metaphor for the narcissism of the times, as the
subject wilfully accepts a violation and all the violence this entails
in exchange for an illusion or fantasy of secu- rity which proves in the
end to have been imbued with the catastrophic from the outset. Our
understanding of the fundamental tenets of violence is invariably
transformed such that we are forced to think about forms of violation/
intervention prior to any sense of dialectical enmity. Premetic Violence
René Girard's thesis Violence and the Sacred offers a theory of violence
that is exclusively bound to the desire to 'over- come' tragedy. To
develop this theory, Girard specifically relates to the classic Greek
play by Sophocles, Oedipus Rex, which he uses to illustrate the
relationship between tragic dispossession and violence. It is through
the tale of Oedipus and his return to reclaim the realm from which he
was abandoned that we uncover a genesis of sacrificial violence that is
linked to some 'past tragedy'.39 Oedipus thus epitomizes the motif of
the lost prince whose modes of contestation can be understood through
competing claims to the 'same object of desire'. The story follows that
when two uncompromising entities vie over the same object of desire,
violence necessarily erupts. Through Gir- ard's decoding of the Oedipus
myth, what we therefore find is any attempt to re-possess the object of
desire neces- sarily requires the guilt of those currently in possession
-- a sacrificial victim. Thus, to overcome tragedy one must come from
the 'outside' -- a violently destined return that can only be justified
by making a claim to the original sin, or what Girard terms a return to
the 'original scene'. However, as Sophocles tells it, such violence is
more than simply a reclamation of that which has been taken. The
violence of the already dispossessed desires to re-establish the
authentic order which has been falsely appropriated -- the paradise
lost. Importantly, for Girard, such violence is not a relation of
difference but is more defined by the logic of mimesis: 'At first, each
of the protagonists believes that he can quell the violence; at the end
each succumbs to it. All are drawn unwittingly into a violent
reciprocity -- which they always think they are outside of, because they
all initially came from outside and mistake this positional and
temporary advantage for a permanent and funda- mental superiority'.40
Plunging into an opposition which 'reduces the protagonists into a
uniform condition of vio- lence', all claims to 'difference' are
effectively 'eclipsed' by 'a resurgence of reciprocity'.41 It has been
common to read Rye's doubling as a clear example of mimetic behaviour.
This has found clear applications from Hegelian-inspired revolutionary
accounts of dialectical reasoning, to Frantz Fanon's theory of (post)
colonial brutality, onto the exceptional violence of Schmitt's sovereign
decisionism. While accepting how this logic has played a structural role
in the demarcation of certain regimes of violence which came to hallmark
distinct marks of separation, we need to depart from this logic if we
are to make sense of the violence of the catastrophic imaginary. What,
in other words, becomes of violence once we reconceptualize the idea of
the original scene and its logics of exposure such that violence itself
becomes virtually ordained? That is to say, what becomes of violence
once it begins to precede any dialectical arrangement? Mimetic violence,
we have noted, is objectifiable. Based upon establishing various forms
of mystical foundations, it has a distinct materiality to it that
permits clear lines of demarcation and embodiment. These work both
spatially and temporally. The object for violence is locatable, while
the time of its occurrence offers clear (if sometimes contested)
conceptions as to its beginning and ending. It benefits, then, from the
guarantees of identification and the ability to represent that which
must be vanquished at a given moment 'in time'. **[The virtual nature of
the violence endured by [the resilient subject]{.mark} offers no such
guarantees. Collapsing the space-time continuum of mimetic rivalry, it
[is]{.mark} merely [projected into]{.mark} the future without the
prospect of bounce-back. Internalized, however, into [the very living
conditions of the subject now permanently under siege]{.mark}, the
violence is no less real. As any author of horror fiction will tell, the
mind can be a terrifying place to inhabit. Once the source of
endangerment becomes unknowable by definition, [everything becomes the
potential source of a violent encounter.]{.mark} [Resilience]{.mark}
challenges the logic of mimetic violence]{.underline}**, therefore,
**[in two fundamental ways]{.underline}**. Firstly, **[it [shows us that
our only way of dealing with endangerment is to absorb its lethal
tendencies. That which has the potential to destroy must become part of
society's make-up and its epistemic
fabric]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[We too]{.underline}**, in the
process, **[become more lethally endowed as a result]{.underline}**.
Invariably, **[the more lethal we become, the more [we end up embracing
the]{.mark} biophysical [conditions of our]{.mark} potential [undoing as
a principle form of human conditioning.]{.mark} The body accepts the
lethality on account of preparedness]{.underline}**. Secondly, **[there
is an outward projection against that which could potentially threaten
our existence]{.underline}**. But **[this projection doesn't connect to
any mimetic rival]{.underline}**. **[We have no clear sense of what it
is that so endangers in its particular guise, only a generalizable
indication that something which is part of the integral whole will
eventually bring about our final demise]{.underline}**.
**[Deprived]{.underline}**, then, **[of the potential to 'at last stand'
upon a terrain whose forms of endangerment were known in advance, we
continue to walk through a veritable minefield of potential disasters of
a multi-dimensional nature, not knowing when the explosion will happen,
with little comfort provided by the intellectual comforts of the past,
and [with no fence on the horizon beyond which relative security may be
achieved and freedom from endangerment realized]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[The only solution]{.underline}**]{.mark}, we are told, **[[remains to
expose oneself to all its disastrous permutations]{.mark} so that we may
be better prepared against those already charged and yet to detonate,
along with those yet to even be inserted into this catastrophic
topography.]{.underline}** But what does it mean to say that violence is
now beyond representation? And what type of reality are we producing if
we are calling into question the depths of field that once gave
qualitative and quantitative meaning to our relations to violence? For
Paul Virilio, whose work we may connect to the premetic, this
inaugurates 'the futurism of the instant' whose kairos shatters all
metaphysical meaning: This spells disorientation in knowledge acquired
over the course of millennia regarding the spatial environment and the
cycle of seasons; an integral accident in knowledge of history as well
as of the usual concrete geography that goes with it, the unity of place
and time of a secular history. No doubt this is the fatal novelty of the
historic tragedy befalling humanity and a progress that will no longer
be exclusively technologistical and extra-planetary, but merely human,
'all too human'. Masochism vis-à-vis an abhorred past that no longer
passes muster is now symmetrically doubled with a masochism in relation
to a future where, for want of fear, we will, this time, have space, all
the space of a miniscule planet reduced to nothing, or as good as, by
the progress of our discoveries.42 Nihilism Unbound Writing in the
nineteenth century, Nietzsche argued that nothing was more deeply
characteristic of the modern world than the power of nihilism.43
Nietzsche's intervention here allowed us to move beyond the
well-rehearsed attack upon Platonic reason or Christian faith, to focus
instead upon 'the radical repudiation of value, meaning and
desirability'.44 Nihilism, thus understood, referred to the triumph of
reactive thinking. It was all about the negation of life as it appeared
to be incapable of affirming that which is properly and creatively
different to human existence. Hence, for Nietzsche, nihilism was not
simply reduc- ible to some historical event in time, i.e. an exceptional
moment in history which could be shamefully written into annals of human
suffering. Nihilism was the recurring motor of history as the operation
of power leads to a will to nothingness that strips life of any
purposeful meaning. Crucially, as Nietzsche understood, this repudiation
of the affirmative realm of experience is something we create for
ourselves.45 Nihilism, in other words, is to be understood through a
sophisticated manipulation of desires such that the individual subject
depreciates itself to such an extent that it actively participates in a
custom of political self-annihilation. Central to Nietzsche's thinking
on the perpetuation of nihilism is the notion of
**[ressentiment]{.underline}**. In his On the Gene- alogy of Morality,
Nietzsche explains this in terms of the slave mentality. This
**[produces a feeling of impotence which not only translates into
vengefulness, but more problematic still, teaches the slave that the
only way it can become free is to give over to the prevailing reason
mastery has set in place]{.underline}**. Sloterdijk equates this
ressentiment with rage, the basis of all great theisms.46 **[[Such a

'paralysing']{.underline}** insomuch **[as it [annuls the possibility of
thinking and acting otherwise]{.mark}, and it was
'exhausting']{.underline}** insomuch as **[[life]{.mark} was [forced to
compromise with the very lethality that put its condition originally
into question]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[Through a 'spirit of
revenge' what is lacking is therefore produced in a double movement, for
lack is not some original gesture, it derives out of the ressentiment to
deny us the opportunity to bring something different into the
world]{.underline}**. This raises a number of pressing questions: Could
it be that not only have we become slaves to our biological existence,
but in claiming false mastery of the earth we have given to ourselves an
illu- sionary sovereignty? For how can we have mastery if that which we
claim to be able to dominate as the principle force makes us
increasingly vulnerable with each passing moment? Have we not, then,
become slaves to ourselves and slaves to the earth, and resentful of
them as a result? **[Nihilism has never been alien to liberal
biopolitics]{.underline}**. **[It is arguably its most potent
expression]{.underline}**. Its early development can be traced to Kant's
Copernican revolution of the mind. **[Placing life at the centre of its
universe, Kant forced us to look for meaning beyond the realms of
theological destiny. Whilst this moved us beyond the suffering and
lament of the Christian subject which so irked Nietzsche, Kant's
universal substitute proved to be no substitute at all]{.underline}**.
The universal was actually denied to us due to the limits of our reason
and our imperfections as finite beings -- imperfections that
significantly proved incapable of moving us beyond the reductionism of
metaphysical idealism and its crude representations, towards a more
affirmative form of metaphysics that worked in practice. As Drucilla
Cornell writes, 'Martin Heidegger famously wrote that Kant takes us to
the limit of the very notion of critique and ultimately raises, but does
not fully address, the question of 'who' is this finite being that must
think through the transcendental imagination'.47 **[In a remarkably
potent yet tragic stroke, Kant wrote the death of the omnipotent God and
the types of docile subjects it produced who were rendered immobile due
to its vengeance and fury, while putting in its place a fallen subject
that was fated to be forever incomplete because of the burdens of its
own actions. While Kant's thinking paved the way for new eschatological
forms of power to emerge that took leave of traditional sovereign
moorings, the fallen subject was compelled to become resentful of its
biological existence]{.underline}**. **[Bios were to remain forever
imperfect by design and fated to be judged accordingly]{.underline}**.
**[With life fated to live a biologically endowed existence, it is
stripped of its capacity to have a meaningful existence beyond the
limits of its bodily formations, while political strategies operate by
governing through the problem of finitude, even though the finite
inevitably became a philosophical problem too difficult to
comprehend]{.underline}**. As a result, **[forced to endure a growing
resentment of its unfolding drama, liberalism slowly became morally
equipped to continually intervene upon the souls of the living simply by
offering to prolong the subject's existence better than any other
political rationality]{.underline}**. **[Such was the realization of our
finite entrapment in the bodily form that the ability to philosophically
transgress the injunction between life and death became increasingly
impossible]{.underline}**. Indeed, as we shall point out later, **[while
liberal societies have a particular relationship to the question of
dying as our existence is continually put into question, such that [with
each passing second we learn to survive until we become truly
meaningless in the end]{.mark}, the idea of death remains
incommensurable to the liberal subject. No longer does [the resilient
subject]{.mark} solely project its resentfulness onto the souls of
'Others'. It [resents the living world, for it]{.mark} too [is radically
endangering]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is here that [**[catastrophic
imaginaries begin to truly thrive]{.underline}**. **[The resilient
subject is]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[shaped and anxiously [mobilized by
the prospect of the coming catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
**[It fears the transformation of the subject, just as it fears the
transformation of the ecosystem that gives sustenance to
life]{.underline}**. **[[Our rage]{.mark} as such]{.underline}**, to
borrow from Sloterdijk, [**[has become truly
limitless]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[As everything becomes the source of
our endangerment, [we internalize the ressentiment and proliferate our
impotence with unrivalled intensity]{.mark} and absolute
necessity]{.underline}**. Hence **[this produces a form of [nihilism
which is 'unbounded']{.mark}]{.underline}**. For **[no longer do we
simply resent the teleological unfolding of history as we phase shift
from masters to slaves to masters; there is no mastery to speak of and
as a result [all our lament filters into a politics of ressentiment as
we are left to simply govern through our continually unfolding state of
unending emergency.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Link---Resilience---2NC

#### Strategies of resilience are the political debasement of the subject -- it puts the living on a permanent life support system that evacuates all possible alternative futures. It's a vigilance against death that stops the living.

Even through a brief social detour on fire, however, **[we can see how
[the continual framing of life in terms of its]{.mark} biological
[vulnerability]{.mark} has a more contested history]{.underline}**.
Indeed, **[even though the compulsion to view life biologically
developed to be one of the defining features of modernity, throughout
this period there was nevertheless some belief that the subject was able
to secure itself from the problems of the world]{.underline}**. This was
backed up by the proliferation of various myths about belonging that
were central to the creation of political communities.
**[Liberalism]{.underline}**, in contrast, [**[operates as if it is
'limitless']{.underline}**. **[Its reach, growth and development demand
more, and more, and more]{.underline}**.]{.mark} However, instead of
relating this to a new-found meta- physical awakening that allows us to
think that there is more to life than its biological endowment,
**[contemporary liberal biopolitics turns infinite potentiality into a
source of limitless endangerment such that all there is to think about
is the sheer necessity and survivability of things]{.underline}**. In
this sense, it is more proper to describe liberal biopolitics as
limitless. **[For rather than taking the open horizon as a space for the
infinitely possible, everything is internalized such that it is haunted
by whatever remains irreducible to its current sensibility. [This
inevitably brings]{.mark} us to the vexed question of a death well
lived. We don't need grand theorizing to make the point that mediations
on death have [a profound impact upon the way we
live]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[Anybody who has known a person
with a terminal illness and becomes anxiously consumed with the prospect
of dying will appreciate how [the thought and presence of death

cannot live because [the very uncertainties]{.mark} (physical and
intellectual) [presented by the]{.mark} mere [thought of death are a
burden that proves]{.mark} too [difficult to
carry]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Hence, **[working in an opposite direction
to Heidegger's much debated claim that the 'absolute impossibility' of
thinking about death constitutes the very possibility of being, the
possibility of its occurrence is sufficient to instil what in fact is
less a fear of death but more a fear of living]{.underline}**. But we
cannot simply stop there. As we have suggested, **[what makes the art of
living so dangerously fascinating today is that it requires us to live
through the source of our endangerment]{.underline}**. **[Trauma and
anxiety as such become our weapons, as [vulnerability is amplified and
played back to us with increasing frequency]{.mark} to their point of
normalization. The political significance of this should not be
underestimated]{.underline}**. Our argument is that **[[the political
debasement of the subject through strategies of resilience]{.mark} more
than [puts the very question of death into question]{.mark} by removing
it from our critical gaze]{.underline}**. In doing so**[, it represents
nothing short of [a profound assault on our ability to think]{.mark}
metaphysically]{.underline}**. **[[This in turn represents a direct
attack upon our abilities to transform the world beyond the catastrophic
condition in which we are now immersed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. After
all, **[[how can we]{.mark} even [conceive of different worlds if we

then, **[a much debated but still yet to be resolved conflict in the

### Link---War Impacts---1NC

#### The assumption that "survival" follows from the prevention of war relies on a false binary that ignores war is the structuring logic of the international system and that survival is only ever survival for some.

[**Grove 19** \[Jairus, Assoc Prof of International Relations at Univ of
Hawai'i at Manoa, *Savage Ecology: War and Geopolitics at the End of the
World*, p.2-4\]]{.underline}

[It is not unusual that more than fifteen thousand scientists would
agree on something. I imagine millions of scientists agree on other
questions, like the basic nature of gravity and the atomic weight of
cobalt. Yet it is difficult to imagine the need or interest to issue a
public statement about these mere descriptions of fact. What makes this
concern worthy of a public address is that the statements issued in 1992
and 2017 are attempts to make a claim on a public, in fact the public:
the global whole of the human species. The tone of both letters invests
the full force of **[collective]{.mark} scientific expertise, argument
making, [and powers of persuasion]{.mark}** on the case to be made for a
threat to the planet. The letters simply **[assume that if the case
is]{.mark} successfully [made that humanity faces impending doom, the
case for saving humanity will automatically follow]{.mark} as if by some
mechanism of logical necessity.** Unfortunately, **[this assumption is
not merely off the mark.]{.mark}** Global politics for the past five
hundred years is proof of the opposite of common sense. There is a
centuries-long investment in research, development, and deployment of
techniques to ensure that **[survival is only ever a right for some.
This right for some]{.mark}, more often than not, [is ensured at the
expense of the self-determination and continuation of living for the
overwhelming majority of the planet]{.mark}'s human population.**
Against the banal appeal to a universal humanity or the equally
commonplace and catastrophic insistence on an inevitable clash of
civilizations, I prefer the idea of "form of life." Not quite race and
more than culture or style, this phrase refers to those ways of being in
the world---always lived collectively---without which one would no
longer be who or what one is. I want to go further than Ludwig
Wittgenstein's invocation of form of life as one's particular game of
language and gesture---the physiognomy that for him makes one human---
into the ways that not just humans but all things creatively striving
toward complexity come to make worlds out of their intractable
dependence on and contribution to an environment.3 And beyond
Wittgenstein's events of communicative failure, interruptions of these
relations and habits threaten existence itself. When efforts are made to
wipe out the American bison and buffalo or to militarize borders to
interrupt the flow of migrants who follow seasons and crops, it is not
just a habit or practice that changes. The interruption of a form of
life kills people and frequently cascades into genocides and
extinctions. In the case of the buffalo, it was not just the bands and
nations of the Great Plains whose precarity was leveraged for the
strategic goal of genocide and settlement. The entire prairie ecosystem
was targeted, moving on from human inhabitants to predators such as
wolves and big cats to make way for leisure hunting and grazing
practices that created the dust bowl and the subsequent collapse of
riparian habitats throughout the United States.4 I take inspiration from
Giorgio Agamben's more radical reading of Wittgenstein's form of life in
my desire to describe lives that cannot survive being separated from the
way they are lived, but like Wittgenstein's linguistic provincialism, I
do not accept Agamben's species provincialism that form of life either
is what defines the human or is exclusively a human attribute.5 Quite
the opposite, when form of life is seen ecologically, what becomes
apparent is how many different species, practices, histories,
cosmologies, habitats, and relations come to constitute what we might
call a form of life. Form of life is a particular origami in the "fabric
of immanent relations" that defines the torsion between the singularity
and the interpenetrated relationality of each and every human and
nonhuman person.6 This question will be taken up more substantially in
chapter 1, but suffice it to say that form of life, for me, is the
current or flow against which we can even identify a change or
intervention as violent rather than merely as a change. And geopolitics,
the focus of all the following chapters and that which the concerned
scientists want to avoid, is the collectively practiced art and science
of that violence against other forms of life. In fact, it is this very
geopolitics---nation- states making decisions and wielding power at a
global scale---that the scientists want to steer away from war toward
saving the planet, which is not premised at some foundational level on a
general principle of order or the good. Geopolitics is, at its most
fundamental level, a husbandry of global life in which thriving is
intimately connected to the particular form of life and the particular
lifeworld through which one becomes who one is. **[Geopolitics is
structured to be selective, and to ensure that selectivity by lethal
force.]{.mark}** Therefore, **[to oppose survival to the pursuit of
war]{.mark} as a global question for a global audience** (as if that
audience were empowered or even capable of issuing a global answer)
**[displays a persistent and willful naïveté of how the global was made
in the first place. The geopolitical project]{.mark} of planet Earth [is
a violent pursuit of a form of life at the cost of others--- full
stop.]{.mark}** However, at the same time, with an often zero-sum game
over form of life at its center, **[global war---the presumed opposite
of human survival---is]{.mark}** not primarily about direct killing.
Instead, the violence of geopolitics is **[an ecological principle of
world making that renders some forms of life]{.mark} principle and other
forms of life useful or [inconsequential.]{.mark}** Emmanuel Levinas is
quite helpful on this point. In his investigation of the antinomy
between philosophy and war, Levinas came to understand the violence of
geopolitics and its pursuit of global war to be less a direct material
force and more an organizational principle of coercive steering and
depriving: "Violence does not consist so much in injuring and
annihilating persons as in interrupting their continuity, making them
play roles in which they no longer recognize themselves, making them
betray not only commitments but their own substance, making them carry
out action that will destroy every possibility for action."7 The attack
on the conditions of life and its formation as a form of life
establishes more than a trade-off between the material costs of warfare
and the pursuit of the Union of Scientists for planetwide and
environmentally sustainable economic and sexual equality. **Geopolitics,
enacted through global war, is itself a form of life that pursues a
savage ecology, radically antagonistic to survival as a collective
rather than discriminatory goal.** Geopolitics, as the organizational
matrix of global war, has as its enemy the very pursuit of what the
scientists see as a commonsense, pragmatically just planet. Therefore,
the line between extreme human misery and just transformation is not
practically or impractically out of reach because of a lack of will or
misuse of resources. **[For the majority of the planet, the failure to
ensure survival is not about an oversight or bad]{.mark} financial
[management.]{.mark}** Instead, **[the line]{.mark} between misery and
something else [is]{.mark} heavily policed and [enforced with
everything, from]{.mark} odious [international debt to hellfire
missiles.]{.mark}** Alfred North Whitehead says every science belies a
metaphysics, or something we could call more broadly a cosmology.8 The
science in question for Savage Ecology is the Euro-American science of
geopolitics. I want to understand the cosmology of geopolitics. Thus,
this book is an effort to understand how a particular formation of
**global war**, as the slow accretion of a form of life, **came to be a
dominant form of life cosmologically at odds with the idea of collective
thriving. [This geopolitical form of life is so caustic, it calls into
question if there has ever been anything as universal as a human species
to be threatened, much less saved.]{.mark}**9]{.underline}

### Link---War Impacts---2NC

#### Focus on particular conflicts, leaders, and policies obscures the global ecology of war and violence that saturates everything

[**Grove 19** \[Jairus, Assoc Prof of International Relations at Univ of
Hawai'i at Manoa, *Savage Ecology: War and Geopolitics at the End of the
World*, p.66-7\]]{.underline}

Following Sloterdijk's pronouncement on the becoming atmospheric of
contemporary warfare, collective **[[violence is saturating every corner
of the Earth]{.mark} system, [but]{.mark} like carbon, [neither the
distributors nor distribution of violence is
equitable.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Saturation is no excuse for
universality. There will never be a we that is human as such. And yet
there is also no tribe, history of proper names, or nation-state that
can bear the responsibility in any meaningful way. Twenty or thirty
generations of malicious and sadistic decisions cannot amount to the
collective effect of the heterogeneous relations that produced the
Eurocene but neither should we let go of the particular forms of life
that congealed around an instrumental approach to collective violence
that swallowed and then organized peoples, nonhuman peoples, and things
throughout Europe and then the regions those people, nonhuman peoples,
and things settled. Mapping something like the totality of those actors
and relations is impossible and maybe even counterproductive, but
tracing the lineages of warfare that came to enable the expansion of the
Europeans until they became a "cene," a geologically and geopolitically
significant order, may gather up a swarm of conceptual machines still
buzzing through our contemporary moment. **[Consequently, [I am less
interested in why]{.mark} once such an institution or assemblage is in
place, [a leader at a given moment succeeds in making]{.mark} actual the
already present virtual tendencies of [war. Consider how difficult it is
to reconcile our lost hope for]{.mark} Barack [Obama with the expected
failure of]{.mark} George W. [Bush or how quickly the terror
over]{.mark} Donald [Trump was normalized]{.mark} once the adults from
the military stepped in, [precisely because foreign policies of each
arrangement of leadership are in many ways indistinguishable,
particularly from the perspectives of their
victims.]{.mark}]{.underline}**19 It is not surprising to me, then, that
sovereigns make war, or that they take advantage of democratic paradoxes
to do so. The problematic that drives this section is how such a
complex, mobile, and global ecology of war so closely aligns and adheres
to such a seemingly local decision as a sovereign act of violence or
declaration of war. One might take a lesson from the electrification of
sound. In order to amplify or magnify a sound and preserve the fidelity
of a particular harmonic arrangement, one cannot simply "turn up" the
volume. It requires a certain interface between the means of
amplification, the ambient qualities of the room, the number of people
present, and the resonant capabilities of those people, the furniture,
the walls, the floor, and the ceiling. Similarly, **[[political decrees
or decisions]{.mark} to produce effects [must reverberate and interface
with]{.mark} complex assemblages of [institutions, economies,]{.mark}
ethical dispositions, [affective discourses, and other machinic
operators.]{.mark}]{.underline}** From this perspective, **[[sovereign
"decisions," whether by presidents or suicide bombers, appear to be on
both sides of the razor's edge between cause and
effect.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Such an approach requires, as Deleuze
writes, "not so much . . . convincing, as being open about things. Being
open is setting out the 'facts' not only of a situation, but of a
problem. Making visible things that would otherwise remain hidden."20
**[So [we have a world full of sovereign violence, but]{.mark} the place
of a given sovereign in [the distribution of that violence remains

### 2NC AT Threats Exist 

#### No objective condition for danger

[**Campbell 98** \[David, Professor of International Politics at the
University of Newcastle, 1998, "Writing Security," pg.
1-2\]]{.underline}

[[Danger is not an objective condition. It]{.underline}]{.mark}
*\[sic*[\] [is not a thing that ex­ists independently of those to whom it
may become a threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. To illus­trate this, consider
the manner in which the insurance industry assesses risk. In Francois
Ewald's formulation, insurance is a technology of risk the principal
function of which is not compensation or repara­tion, [[but rather the
operation of a schema of rationality distinguished by the calculus of
probabilities.]{.mark} In insurance, according to this logic,
[danger]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(or, more accurately, risk)
[[is]{.mark} "neither an event nor a general kind of event occurring in
reality.. . but [a]{.mark} specific [mode of treatment of]{.mark}
certain [events]{.mark} capable of happening to a group of individuals."
In other words, for the technology of risk in insurance, "[Nothing is a
risk in itself]{.mark}; there is no risk in reality [But]{.mark} on the
other hand, [anything can be a risk; it]{.mark} all [depends on how one
analyzes]{.mark} the [danger]{.mark}, consid­ers the event.]{.underline}
As Kant might have put it, the category of risk is a cat­egory of the
understanding; it cannot be given in sensibility or intu­ition."^2^ In
these terms, danger is an effect of interpretation. [[Danger bears no
essential, necessary, or unproblematic relation to the action or event
from which it is said to derive]{.mark}. Nothing is intrinsically more
dangerous for insurance technology than anything else, except when
interpreted as such.]{.underline}

#### Psychology is on our side---their threat claims are psychological projections to account for underlying feelings of instability. 

[**Sullivan et al '10** (Daniel, Researcher in the Department of
Psychology, University of Kansas, Mark J. Landau, assistant professor of

Evidence That People Attribute Influence to Personal and Political
Enemies to Compensate for Threats to Control Journal of Personality and
Social Psychology," 98. 3 (Mar 2010): 434-449, Proquest,
JS)]{.underline}

On the basis of Becker's (1969) existential theorizing, we have proposed
**[that [perceiving the self as having powerful enemies serves a
psychological function]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the individual **[[by
compensating for threatened perceptions of control over one's
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Specifically, enemies serve as
psychological focal points for what are otherwise diffuse threats to
one's life and well-being that are impossible to fully anticipate or
control. This analysis suggests that **[[people]{.mark} will [imbue
enemy figures with exaggerated influence]{.mark} and power [when
feelings of control are threatened]{.mark} and that perceiving powerful
enemies capable of perpetrating diffuse misdeeds will bolster feelings
of personal control by reducing perceptions of chaotic risks in one's
environment.]{.underline}** The current studies provide the first
empirical tests of these claims. Study 1 showed that when people were
reminded of the prevalence of chaotic hazard in their environment, those
individuals characterized by dispositionally low feelings of personal
control were more likely to view a personal enemy as having influence
over their lives, but this effect did not extend to perceptions of a
generically aversive other. Study 2 provided a conceptual replication of
this effect on perceptions of a political enemy in a more ecologically
valid context, with an experimental manipulation of perceived control
over chaotic hazards. In accord with predictions, situationally reduced
feelings of personal control increased participants' belief that a
public enemy figure---the opponent of their chosen candidate in the 2008
U.S. presidential election---was wielding power to surreptitiously
manipulate the election. This study furthermore showed that the
hypothesized effect was not simply due to an increase in generalized
suspiciousness, concern with unwanted election outcomes, or generally
negative evaluations of the enemy candidate. Supplementing Becker's
(1969) analysis with M. Douglas's (1966) account of cultural differences
in enemyship, we hypothesized that **[[enemyship will be]{.mark} an
[especially attractive]{.mark} means of compensating for control threats
[when the broader social system is perceived as disordered]{.mark} and
incapable of providing protection from harm]{.underline}**, whereas
bolstering the perceived strength of the system will be the preferred
response when the system appears ordered and secure. The results of
Study 3 supported this hypothesis: Participants led to view the
prevailing system as disordered responded to a control threat by viewing
a personal enemy as responsible for negative occurrences in their lives
and by denying the influence of random forces on negative occurrences.
However, these participants were no more likely to attribute positive
life events to a friend's influence. In contrast, and in line with Kay
et al.'s (2008) findings, participants led to view the system as ordered
responded to control threats by bolstering their belief in the system's
order and strength. Study 4 tested whether perceiving an enemy capable
of causing diffuse harms would actually decrease perceived risk in the
world and thereby bolster feelings of personal control. As predicted,
control-threatened participants who were exposed to an ambiguously
powerful enemy (but not one whose powers were explicitly known or who
was weak) showed reduced perceptions of chaotic risk, which in turn
bolstered perceptions of personal control. Taken together, **[[the
current studies are the first to]{.mark} systematically [examine the
psychological function served by perceiving powerful enemies in the
world]{.mark},]{.underline}** while additionally providing evidence of
the psychological process by which enemies serve a controlrestorative
function, **[[and the situational conditions under which people are more
likely to exaggerate an enemy's power and influence as a means of
compensating for personal control concerns.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### 2NC Fear Politics DA

#### Apocalyptic rhetoric makes it ever-present

[**Coviello 2k** \[Peter, assistant professor of English at Bowdoin
College, Apocalypse From Now On\]]{.underline}

Perhaps. But to claim that American culture is at present decisively
postnuclear is not to say that the world we inhabit is in any way
post-apocalyptic. Apocalypse, as I began by saying, changed -- it did
not go away. And here I want to hazard my second assertion: if, in the
nuclear age of yesteryear, apocalypse signified an event threatening
everyone and everything with (in Jacques Derrida's suitably menacing
phrase) "remainderless and a-symbolic destruction," then in the
postnuclear world apocalypse is an affair whose parameters are
definitively local. In shape and in substance, apocalypse is defined now
by the affliction it brings somewhere else, always to an "other" people
whose very presence might then be written as a kind of dangerous
contagion, threatening the safety and prosperity of a cherished "general
population." This fact seems to me to stand behind Susan Sontag's
incisive observation, from 1989, that, "Apocalypse is now a long running
serial: not 'Apocalypse Now' but 'Apocalypse from Now On.'" The decisive
point here in the perpetuation of the threat of apocalypse (the point
Sontag goes on, at length, to miss) is that [the [apocalypse is ever
present because]{.mark}, as an element in a vast economy of power, [it
is ever useful]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is, [[though]{.mark} the
[perpetual threat of destruction]{.mark}]{.underline} -- through the
constant reproduction of the figure of the apocalypse -- the
[[agencies]{.mark} of power [ensure their authority]{.mark} to act on
and through the bodies of a particular population.]{.underline} No one
turns this point more persuasively than Michel Foucault, who in the
final chapter of his first volume of *The History of Sexuality*
addresses himself to the problem of a power that is less repressive than
productive, less life-threatening than, in his words,
["life-administering." Power,]{.underline} he contends, ["exerts a
positive influence on life]{.underline} ... [\[and\] endeavors to
administer, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls
and comprehensive regulations."]{.underline} In his brief comments on
what he calls "the atomic situation," however, Foucault insists as well
that the [productiveness of modern power must not be mistaken for a
uniform repudiation of violent or even lethal means.]{.underline} For
[[as "managers of life and survival]{.mark}, of bodies and the race,"
agencies of [modern power]{.mark} presume to [act "on the behalf of the
existence of everyone." Whatsoever might be construed as a
threat]{.mark} to life and survival in this way [serves to authorize any
expression of force]{.mark}, no matter how invasive, or, indeed,
potentially annihilating.]{.underline} "If [[genocide is]{.mark} indeed
[the dream of modern power]{.mark},"]{.underline} Foucault writes, "this
is not because of a recent return to the ancient right to kill' it is
[because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the
species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of
population."]{.underline} For [a state that would arm
itself]{.underline} not with the power to kill its population, but
[with]{.underline} a more [comprehensive power]{.underline} over the
patters and functioning of its collective life, [[the threat of]{.mark}
an [apocalyptic demise]{.mark}, nuclear or otherwise, seems a civic
initiative that [can scarcely be done without]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Turns us into 'pure warriors' who endlessly rehearse our own deaths---leaves us unable to confront cruelty in our everyday lives

Paul **[Virilio and]{.underline}** Sylvere **[Lotringer\'s concept of
\"pure war\" refers to the potential of a culture to destroy itself
completely]{.underline}** (12). 2 **[We as psychoanalysts can---and
increasingly must---explore the impact of this concept on our
practice]{.underline}**, and on the growing number of patients who live
with the inability to repress or dissociate their experience and
awareness of the pure war condition. The realization of a patient\'s
worst fears in actual catastrophic events has always been a profound
enough psychotherapeutic challenge. [T**hese days, however,
[catastrophic events]{.mark} not only threaten friends, family, and
neighbors; they also [become]{.mark} the stuff of [endless
repetitions]{.mark} and dramatizations**]{.underline} on radio,
television, and Internet. 3 **[Such continual reminders of death and
destruction affect us all]{.underline}**. What is the role of the
analyst treating patients who live with an ever-threatening sense of the
pure war lying just below the surface of our cultural veneer? At the end
of the First World War, the first \"total war,\" Walter Benjamin
observed that \"nothing \[after the war\] remained unchanged but the
clouds, and beneath these clouds, in a field of force of destructive
torrents and explosions, was the tiny, fragile human body\"(84).
**[Julia Kristeva makes a similar note about our contemporary situation,
\"The recourse to atomic weapons seems to prove that horror\...can rage
absolutely]{.underline}**\" (232). And, as if he too were acknowledging
this same fragility and uncontainability, the French politician Georges
Clemenceau commented in the context of World War I that \"war is too
serious to be confined to the military\" (qtd. in Virilio and Lotringer
15). **[Virilio and Lotringer gave the name \"[pure war]{.mark}\" to
[the]{.mark} psychological [condition that results when people
know]{.mark} that [they live in a world where the possibility for
absolute destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}(e.g., nuclear
holocaust) **[[exists]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[As Virilio and
Lotringer see it, [it is not the technological capacity]{.mark} for
destruction]{.underline}** (**[that is, for example, the existence [of
nuclear armaments]{.mark}]{.underline}**[) **[that
imposes]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[the [dread characteristic]{.mark} of a
pure war psychology [but the belief systems]{.mark} that [this capacity
sets up]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Psychological survival requires that
a way be found]{.underline}**]{.mark} (at least unconsciously) [[to
**escape inevitable destruction**]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[it requires
a way out---[but]{.mark} this enforces an irresolvable
paradox]{.underline}**, **[because [the definition of pure war]{.mark}
culture [is that there is no escape]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Once
people believe in the external possibility]{.underline}**---at least
those people whose defenses cannot handle the weight of the dread that
pure war imposes---**[[pure war becomes an internal condition, a
perpetual state of preparation for absolute destruction and for
personal, social, and cultural death.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The tragedy
at the World Trade Center in New York City has given us a bitter but
important opportunity to study the effects of the pure war condition on
individuals. It allows us to look at how this all-encompassing state
appears in psychoanalytic treatment and to observe its influence through
the analysis of transference/countertransference dynamics. The pure war
condition has been brought grimly to consciousness. In this paper, I
will explore how it manifests itself in society, in character, and most
specifically in the psychoanalytic treatment of one patient whose
dynamics highlight significant aspects of the pure war state. How does
treatment happen when, at some level, we perceive ourselves as already
dead? Whatever our individual differences, our visions of the
psychoanalytic endeavor arise out of the social defense of the culture
within which we live and work (I have referred to this as \"community
character,\" cf. Borg 350). **[And whatever our individual differences,
in a pure war situation the primary task is simply to sustain the dream
of psychic survival.]{.underline}** The case of Joyce, who saw the first
explosion at the World Trade Center as she rode down Fifth Avenue in a
bus after her session with me, exemplifies this task. \[End Page 57\]
The Pure Warrior **[T]{.underline}**h**[e philosophy (or practice) of
\"pure warriors,\" that is, of people who are preoccupied with the pure
war condition of their society, is based on the perpetual
failure]{.underline}** within them of the dissociation and repression
th**[at allow others to function in a situation that is otherwise
completely overwhelming.]{.underline}** Joyce was one of those who lived
on the border of life and death; she could not escape awareness of that
dread dichotomy that most of us are at great pains to dissociate**[. She
manifested the state of perpetual preparation that is the hallmark of
pure war culture]{.underline}** **[and of the insufficiently defended
pure warrior,]{.underline}** **[and also a constant awareness of the
nearness of death in all its various forms]{.underline}**. She
understood quite well, for instance, that **[when people are
institutionalize]{.underline}**d (as she had been on numerous
occasions), \"**[society is defining them as socially
dead]{.underline}**, \[a**[nd that at that point\] the essential task to
be carried out is to help inmates to make their transition from social
death to physical death\"]{.underline}** (Miller and Gwynne 74).
**[Against this backdrop, Joyce sought psychoanalysis as a \"new
world,\" the place where she would break free from the deathly
institutionalized aspects of her self, and begin her life
anew.]{.underline}** **[Her search for a \"new world\" included the
possibility of a world that was not a pure war world]{.underline}**---a
prelapsarian Eden. **[Virilio and Lotringer state that \"war exists in
its preparation\"]{.underline}** (53). And Sun Tsu, who wrote over 2400
years ago and yet is often considered the originator of modern warfare,
said in The Art of War, \"Preparation everywhere means lack everywhere\"
(44). **[This means that when the members of a culture must be on guard
on all fronts, the resources of that culture are necessarily scattered
and taxed]{.underline}**. **[The more defenses are induced and enacted,
the more psychologically impoverished a culture]{.underline}** (**[or a
person) will be]{.underline}**. In war-torn nations, resources like
food, clothing, and materials for shelter may be scarce in the general
population because they are shunted off to the military. **[Similarly,
the hoarding of psychological resources and the constant alert status of
the defense system are outcomes of existence in a pure war
culture]{.underline}**. We can see this scattering and scarcity of
resources occurring already in the United States as billions of dollars
are shunted from social services to war efforts and homeland security.
**[[In pure war cultures]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[that is, in
cultures that enact a perpetual preparation for
war]{.underline}**---**[the notion of [peace is]{.mark} itself
[a]{.mark} defensive [fantasy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[although to
survive psychically we distract ourselves from such frightening
stimuli]{.underline}** as widespread terrorist activities and other
events that demonstrate our pure war status. **[[Pure war obliterates
the distinction between soldier and citizen]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[We have all been drafted.]{.underline}** According to Virilio and
Lotringer, \"**[All of us are already civilian soldiers, without knowing
it\...[War happens everywhere, but we no longer have the means of
recognizing it]{.mark}\"]{.underline}** (42).

socially self-instituting future. Foremost [among]{.underline} the
possible [distortions of farsightedness is **alarmism, the manufacturing

operate as **Trojan horses advancing political agendas**]{.mark} or
commercial interests that would otherwise be susceptible to public
scrutiny and opposition[. Instances of this kind of manipulation]{.mark}
of the dystopian imaginary are plentiful: the invasion of Iraq in the
name of fighting terrorism and an imminent threat of use of 'weapons of
mass destruction']{.underline}; the severe curtailing of American civil
liberties amidst fears of a collapse of 'homeland security'; the
neoliberal dismantling of the welfare state as the only remedy for an

so forth. **[[Alarmism constructs and codes the future in particular

## Cyber Security

### Link---Cyber Security---1NC

#### The discourse of cyber security [creates a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline} and undermines effective responses---their impact claims are also presumptively [false.]{.underline} 

[**Barnard-Wills and Ashenden '12** (David, Research Fellow in the
Department of Informatics and Systems Engineering, Cranfield University,
UK and Debi, senior research fellow in information assurance at the
Royal Military College of Science, Cranfield University, U.K., "Securing
Virtual Space: Cyber War, Cyber Terror, and Risk," Space and Culture
XX(X), JS)]{.underline}

This article has developed an overview of the dominant cyber security
discourse, drawing on governmentality theory and discourse analysis. It
identified a particular way of constructing the "problem of cyberspace"
that focused on threat, risk, and vulnerability arising from
technological sources and the nature of virtual space. Discourses
attempt to suture the political space. For Laclau, this is the operation
of ideology (a term he strips of some of its pejorative connotations).
[All discourses contain ideological elements, and there could not be a
society without an ideological dimension]{.underline}. We attempted to
show that [cyber security discourse]{.underline}, [which is currently
serving as a basis for cyber security policy in the]{.underline} United
Kingdom and [United States]{.underline}, and perhaps elsewhere, [is but
one way of understanding and conceptualizing virtual space]{.underline}.
[There are a number of implications that arise from this
discourse]{.underline}. First, **[[cyber security discourse supports the
militarization of online space]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Haggerty argues
that [[information war]{.underline}]{.mark}, understood as an ongoing
feature of the contemporary international environment, [**[means that
war]{.mark}** essentially **[becomes permanent]{.mark}**, part of the
"ongoing military gamesmanship of cyberspace"]{.underline} (Haggerty,
2006b, p. 252). [[Constructing cyberspace as a source of national
security threat encourages the application of security practices from
other environments]{.mark} that may be inappropriate or actively harmful
to online activity. [The language of attack and defense]{.mark} and of
"cyber war" [risks pushing out the needs of the civil sector]{.mark} and
individual Internet users, [reducing openness and increasing
surveillance. Security discourses risk shutting down discussion about
Internet policy]{.mark}, moving it from relatively open areas of
government to the closed world of national security decision making.
This risks [excluding an important range of actors]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Furthermore, **[[constructing cyberspace as a]{.mark} site of risk and
[threat poses the potential of a self-fulfilling
prophecy]{.mark}]{.underline}** as that space is increasingly
militarized by various parties. Nations do not operate in a vacuum and
**[[there is the]{.mark} [possibility ]{.mark}]{.underline}[([although
not the necessity) of a cyberspace security
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}**[[. Governmental assemblages can make
political accountability and transparency of decision making diffused
through amorphous partnerships.]{.mark}]{.underline} Lessig (1999)
argues that indirect regulation misdirects responsibility. When
government uses other structures of constraint to affect a constraint it
could impose directly, it muddies the responsibility for the constraint,
thus undermining political accountability. [Burying policy choices in
complex networks of actors potentially blurs the link between regulation
and its consequences]{.underline} (Lessig, 1999). Care should be taken
that cyber security relationships between the public sector and private
sector should be transparent and democratically accountable.
[[Focusing]{.mark} purely [on]{.mark} technological capabilities and
[vulnerabilities,]{.mark} wielded or exploited by faceless hostile
actors**, p[ushes out a consideration of the wider political]{.mark},
legal, and normative [structure that surrounds these.]{.mark}
[Presenting technologically advanced societies as highly
vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline} is to invert a much deeper structural
asymmetry between developed and developing countries and between states
and individuals. **[It also [confuses risk calculations,]{.mark} [driven
by possibility rather than probability or
intention.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Focusing purely on technological
possibilities exaggerates the impact of "asymmetric" actors and ignores
other resources of states. A greater attention needs be paid to the
political and international dimensions surrounding cyber security.
Finally, [[the]{.mark} perpetually deferred threat and [assumption of
vulnerability arises from limited]{.mark} quantitative and qualitative
[data in the public domain]{.mark}. [This allows]{.mark} a [cyber
security discourse to operate from a position of power derived from
"expertise]{.mark}" and makes it hard to debate the claims made by
industry]{.underline} for the prevalence of serious cyber threats.
[[This leads to policymaking dominated by possibility and technological
capability excluding the broader social]{.underline}]{.mark},
political[, and international [complex that surrounds and contextualizes
cyber security.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Cyber-terrorism is a constructed threat propagated by the media---their threat discourse [turns the case]{.underline} and empirically has allowed for events like 9/11 to happen.

Finally, what were some of the effects of the cyberterror threat image
as constructed in the US media and described in the foregoing?
[[While]{.mark} so-called '[cyberpanics' may have imaginary
origins]{.mark}, [they **can** ]{.mark}**also [have very real
consequences]{.mark}** (Sandwell 2006: 46). [The risk of a massive
conventional terrorist attack on the US was emphasized by a small number
of academics]{.mark} and others [before]{.mark} the events of [11
September]{.mark} 2001, [but was dismissed by the
media]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Nacos 2002: 1f.), [[which chose to focus
on cyberterrorism]{.underline}]{.mark} instead[. [Key decision-makers
were]{.mark} therefore [much more attuned to the latter threat than the
former.]{.mark}]{.underline} Marcus Sachs,14 who served in the White
House Office of Cyberspace Security and was a staff member of the
President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, had this to say in
2003 about the convergence of policymakers' fear of technology with
their fear of terrorism: We were very shocked in the federal government
that the attack didn't come from cyberspace \[...\] Based on what we
knew at the time, the most likely scenario was an attack from
cyberspace, not airliners slamming into buildings \[...\] We had spent a
lot of time preparing for a cyber attack, not a physical attack.
(Poulsen 2003) [People's sense of what issues are of political relevance
is always an ongoing process, which requires an emphasis on how threat
images are discursively constructed, maintained, and altered. This
points to why particular emphasis needs to be placed upon the processes
whereby (national) security issues communicatively emerge, and the
central role of the media in such emergences. [The political
communication/threat image environment shapes both the information
available and the way]{.mark}s]{.underline} in which not just ordinary
people, but also political [[elites]{.underline}, [use it in thinking
about politics]{.underline}]{.mark} [and national security.]{.underline}
Demonstrating the effects of the media's influence on publics and
decision-makers is always difficult due to the indirect and complex
dynamics involved; clearly, however[, **[the US media has been highly
successful in 'speaking' cyberterrorism into
existence]{.underline}**]{.mark}[**.** Their reliance on]{.underline}
'(hyper-)reality-producing dramas' (Debrix 2001: 153), Pearl Harbor
analogies, [[comparisons of the effects of cyberterrorism with those of
WMD,]{.mark} portrayal of hackers as a menace to national security, and
general widening of the concept of cyberterrorism, in conjunction with
the policy window opened by the events of 11 September 2001]{.underline}
and, consequently, the ability to cast Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida as
certain future cyberterrorists [[has resulted in the hyping of an
(imagined) fatal connection between virtual networks and critical
infrastructures that]{.underline}]{.mark}, to date, **[[has]{.mark} very
[little real form or substance]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} This
conclusion may not be quite as disturbing as it might first appear,
however, for François Debrix suggests that [[all of the]{.mark} various
[apocalyptic scenarios]{.mark}, televised simulations, and musings as to
the greater lethality of virtual over nuclear attacks
[have]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in fact, [[ensured that a virtual
Pearl Harbor will never materialize]{.underline}]{.mark}. The reason is
that the fear of cyberterrorism has been spread so widely and with such
success that **[[should a 'real' attack ever occur, it couldn't match
expectations]{.underline}]{.mark}**: '[Being conditioned to such a
degree of generalised panic, [any real cyberterrorist attack that does
not follow the simulated scenario]{.mark} and produce the anticipated
amount of casualties [will fall short of being worthy of people's
attention and worry']{.mark}]{.underline} (Debrix 2001: 156).

[[The empirical evidence]{.mark} provided to us from historians and

### 2NC Cyber---Militarized Framing DA 

#### Their disaster/ war framing of cyber attacks [turns the case]{.underline}---it causes the same type of governmental paternalism on display during hurricane Katrina and prevents a broader response to potential threats.

Next, [[a disaster framing portends cybersecurity planning dominated by
the same "command and control]{.underline}]{.mark} \[C2\] [[model"
rooted in]{.mark} [flawed assumptions of]{.mark} inevitable
"[panic]{.mark}" [and]{.mark} "[social collapse]{.mark}" that has
increasingly dominated official U.S. disaster planning]{.underline}
(Quarantelli, 2008: 897). [[The result has been]{.mark} ever [more
centralized, hierarchical, and bureaucratic disaster responses
that]{.mark} increasingly [rely upon the military to restore
order]{.mark} and official control]{.underline} first and foremost
(Quarantelli, 2008: 895--896; Alexander, 2006; Lakoff, 2006). [[The
result can be a form of "government paternalism]{.mark}" [in which
officials panic]{.mark} about the possibility of panic **[and then take
actions that exacerbate the situation]{.mark}** by]{.underline} [not
only failing to provide victims with the help they need, but also
preventing them from effectively helping themselves]{.underline} (Dynes,
2006; Clarke & Chess, 2009: 999--1001). [[This phenomenon was on display
in]{.mark} the official response to Hurricane
[Katrina]{.mark}]{.underline} (Clarke & Chess, 2009: 1003--1004). [In
the realm of cybersecurity, there are already provisions for the
military's USCYBERCOM to provide assistance to the Department of
Homeland Security in the event of a domestic cyber
emergency]{.underline} (Ackerman, 2010). Reminiscent of self-imposed
blackouts during WWII, [Senator Joseph Lieberman's proposal for
a]{.underline} so-called "[Internet kill switch,"]{.underline} which
would give the president the authority to cut U.S. Internet connections
to the rest of the world in the event of a large-scale cyberattack,5 [is
[the]{.mark} **[ultimate expression]{.mark}** [of the desire to regain
control by developing the means to destroy that which we fear to
lose]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The war/disaster framing]{.mark} at the
heart of cyber-doom scenarios and much of contemporary U.S.
cybersecurity discourse [risks focusing policy on]{.mark} [the narrowest
and]{.mark} [least likely portion of the overall cybersecurity
challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}---i.e. acts of "cyberwar" [leading to
economic, social, or civilizational collapse---[while]{.mark}
potentially [diverting attention and resources away from]{.mark} [making
preparations to prevent or mitigate the effects]{.mark} [of more
realistic]{.mark} but perhaps less dramatic
[scenarios]{.mark}.]{.underline} But, there are a number of principles
that can guide the formulation and evaluation of cybersecurity policy
that can help us to avoid these pitfalls.

#### Their militarized framing of cyber attacks allows the government to militarize and manage the body politic of the internet---it also [independently turns the case]{.underline}.

[[The language that we use to frame problems opens up some avenues for
response while closing off others]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[In cyber-doom
scenarios]{.underline}, [cybersecurity is framed primarily in terms of
"war"]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, with the use of
terms like "cyber-9/11" and "cyber-Katrina," in terms of [large-scale
"[disaster]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[This]{.mark} war/disaster
[framing]{.mark} can [lead to a militarist]{.mark}, command and control
[mindset that is]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately
**[[counter-productive]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[A war framing implies
the need for **military solutions**]{.mark} to cybersecurity challenges,
[even though most of what gets lumped under]{.mark} the term
"[cyberwar]{.mark}" [are]{.mark} really [acts of crime]{.mark},
espionage, or political protest]{.underline}, and even though it is not
at all clear that a military response is either appropriate or effective
(Lewis, 2010). Nonetheless, [[the establishment of]{.mark} the
military's U.S. Cyber Command ([USCYBERCOM]{.mark}) has been the most
significant U.S. response yet to perceived cyber-threats. Such a
response **[is fraught with danger]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First,
[[the]{.mark} very [existence of USCYBERCOM]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
has both an offensive and defensive mission, [[could undermine]{.mark}
the [U.S. policy of promoting a free and open Internet worldwide]{.mark}
[by encouraging]{.mark} greater Internet [censorship and
filtering]{.mark}, [as well as]{.mark} more rapid [militarization of
cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cavelty, 2007: 143). For example, [some
have already called for USCYBERCOM to launch strikes on
WikiLeaks]{.underline}, which leaked hundreds of thousands of classified
U.S. documents about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (McCullagh, 2010b;
Whitton, 2010; Thiessen, 2010). [Such a response would only serve to
create a "say-do gap"]{.underline} (Mullen, 2009) [that potential
adversaries could use to justify their own development and use of
offensive cyber weapons and efforts to thwart whatever possibility there
is for international cooperation on cybersecurity.]{.underline} Second,
[[there is the danger of "blow back]{.underline}]{.mark}." In a highly
interconnected world, [[there is no guarantee that an offensive
cyberattack]{.mark} launched [by the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates against another country [would not result in]{.mark}
[serious collateral damage]{.mark} [to]{.mark} noncombatants or even end
up causing harm to [the United States]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cavelty,
2007: 143). [Such "blow back" may have occurred in a recent case where
the United States military took down a Jihadist discussion
forum]{.underline}, [causing collateral damage to noncombatant computers
and websites, as well as undermining an ongoing U.S. intelligence
gathering operation]{.underline} (Nakashima, 2010). [Third, [there is
the risk of conflict escalation from cyberattack to physical
attack]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the United States launched a cyberattack
against a state or non-state actor lacking the capability to respond in
kind, [that actor might chose to respond with physical
attacks]{.underline} (Clarke, 2009). There have even been calls for the
United States to respond with conventional military force to
cyberattacks that amounted to little more than vandalism (Zetter, 2009;
Dunn, 2010). [Finally, [a]{.mark} 2009 [review of]{.mark} U.S. [military
strategy documents]{.mark}, combined with statements from officials,

JS)]{.underline}

But we have not seen anything close to the kinds of scenarios outlined
by Yoran, Ergma, Toffler, and others. [[Terrorists did not use
cyberattack against the]{.mark} [World Trade Center]{.mark}; they used
hijacked aircraft]{.underline}. [[And the attack]{.mark} of 9/[11 did
not lead to the long-term collapse of the U.S.
economy]{.mark};]{.underline} we would have to wait for the impacts of
years of bad mortgages for a financial meltdown. [[Nor did the
cyberattacks on Estonia approximate what happened on 9/11]{.mark} as
Yoran has claimed]{.underline}, [**[and certainly not nuclear
warfare]{.mark}** as Ergma has claimed]{.underline}. In fact, a
scientist at the NATO Co-operative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence,
which was established in Tallinn, Estonia in response to the 2007
cyberattacks, has written that the immediate impacts of those attacks
were "minimal" or "nonexistent," and that the "no critical services were
permanently affected" (Ottis, 2010: 72). Nonetheless, [many
cybersecurity proponents continue to offer up cyber-doom scenarios that
not only make analogies to weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}
(WMDs[) and the terrorist attacks of 9/11, but also hold out economic,
social, and even civilizational collapse as possible impacts of
cyberattacks]{.underline}. A report from the Hoover Institution has
warned of so-called "eWMDs" (Kelly & Almann, 2008); the FBI has warned
that a cyberattack could have the same impact as a "wellplaced bomb"
(FOXNews.com, 2010b); and official DoD documents refer to "weapons of
mass disruption," implying that cyberattacks might have impacts
comparable to the use of WMD (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
2004, 2006). John Arquilla, one of the first to theorize cyberwar in the
1990s (Arquilla & Ronfeldt, 1997), has spoken of "a grave and growing
capacity for crippling our tech-dependent society" and has said that a
"cyber 9/11" is a matter of if, not when (Arquilla, 2009). Mike
McConnell, who has claimed that we are already in an ongoing cyberwar
(McConnell, 2010), has even predicted that a cyberattack could surpass
the impacts of 9/11 "by an order of magnitude" (The Atlantic, 2010).
Finally, some have even compared the impacts of prospective cyberattacks
to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed roughly a quarter million
people and caused widespread physical destruction in five countries
(Meyer, 2010); suggested that cyberattack could pose an "existential
threat" to the United States (FOXNews.com 2010b); and offered the
possibility that cyberattack threatens not only the continued existence
of the United States, but all of "global civilization" (Adhikari, 2009).
In response, critics have noted that not only has the story about who
threatens what, how, and with what potential impact shifted over time,
but it has done so with very little evidence provided to support the
claims being made (Bendrath, 2001, 2003; Walt, 2010). Others have noted
that [the [cyber-doom scenarios]{.mark} offered for years by

they are possible at all]{.mark}]{.underline} (Stohl, 2007). Some have
also questioned the motives of cybersecurity proponents. [Various [think

## Russia

### Link---Russia---1NC 

#### Their framing of Russia is based on a discourse of danger and uncertainty---fear is constructed to stabilize sovereign identity and draw a delineation between the Russian and American body politic---the 1AC is a chain of equivalence which locks in a violent securitized ideology of Russia 

[**Jæger 2k** (Øyvind, Professor at the Norwegian Institute of
International Affairs and the Copenhagen Peace Research Institute,
November 2000, "Securitizing Russia: Discursive Practices of the Baltic
States," Peace and Conflict Studies, Vol. 7, No. 2, JS)]{.underline}

Security, to be sure, is about the sovereignty and survival of the state
as such--the state as an independent political unit. That does not,
however, necessarily imply a privileging of the military sector of the
state as is the case with classical security. Following Ole Wæver
(1997a; 1995; 1994), what pertains to [security should be looked at as
the speech-act of politics the discursive practice of doing by
saying]{.underline} which is at work when states, not least the Baltic
ones, are seeking to secure state formations. What is an issue of
security, and what not, is delineated through speech-acts in a
performative discursive practice coined by Ole Wæver (1997a; 1995; 1994)
as securitisation, making security issues of what is spoken of as
security: One speaks security, and therefore it is a matter of security.
As with sovereignty (cf. Walker 1993), [[security has no ontological
basis outside of discourse]{.underline}.]{.mark} An army is not a threat
in and of itself--it is merely an army--but becomes one when denoted in
terms of danger. Conceiving of security as a speech-act, Wæver argues
that [security is not something]{.underline}\" out there\" [with an
objective existence and a priori ontology]{.underline}, something that
one should strive to acquire as much of as one possibly can. On the
contrary, [security is an act that comes into play by]{.underline} the
very [**u[tterance]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the word security. Security
is a field of practice into which subject matters can be inserted as
well as exempted. Security is a code for going about a particular
business in very particular ways. [By labelling an issue]{.underline} a
security issue, that is, [a threat to security, **one [legitimises the
employment of extraordinary measures to counter the
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}, because it threatens security. In other
words, **[[security is a self-referential
practice]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that carries its own legitimisation and
justification]{.underline}. Security issues are allotted priority above
everything else because everything else is irrelevant if sovereignty is
lost, the state loses independence and ceases to exist. This makes for
the point that it is not security as an objective or a state of affairs
that is the crux of understanding security, but rather the typical
operations and modalities by which security comes into play, Wæver
(1995) notes. 15 The typical operations are speech-acts and the modality
threat- defence sequences. That is, perceiving and conveying threats and
calling upon defence hold back the alleged threat. This is also a
self-referential practice with the dynamic of a security dilemma:
[[Defensive measures taken with reference to a perceived threat **cause
increased sense of insecurity and new calls for
defence**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and so forth. Wæver's argument is that
this logic is at work also in other fields than those busying themselves
with military defence of sovereignty. Moreover, [[viewing security as a
speech act]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[makes it possible
to]{.mark}]{.underline} include different sectors in a study of
security, and thus **[[open up the concept]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It
also clears the way [**[for resolving security concerns by
desecuritising issues]{.underline}**]{.mark} which through
securitisation have raised the concern [[**in the first place**. Knowing
the logic of securitisation and pinning it down when it is at work
carries the possibility of **reversing the
process**]{.underline}]{.mark} by advocating other modalities for
dealing with a given issue unluckily cast as a matter of security. What
is perceived as a threat and therefore invoking defence, triggering the
spiral, might be perceived of otherwise, namely as a matter of political
discord to be resolved by means of ordinary political conduct,(ie not by
rallying in defence of sovereignty). **[A call for more security will
not eliminate threats and dangers]{.underline}**. It is a call for more
insecurity as **[[it will reproduce threats and perpetuate a security
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Wæver (1994: 8) 16 puts it:\"
Transcending a security problem, politicizing a problem can therefore
not happen through thematization in terms of security, only away from
it.\" That is what de-securitisation is about. David Campbell (1992) has
taken the discursive approach to security one step further. He
demonstrates that security is pretty much the business of (state)
identity. His argument is developed from the claim that foreign policy
is a discourse of danger that came to replace Christianity's evangelism
of fear in the wake of the Westphalian peace. But the effects of a\"
**[[evangelism of fear]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" and a discourse of
danger are similar--namely to **[[produce]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
certitude [of **[identity by depicting difference as
otherness]{.underline}**]{.mark}. As the Peace of Westphalia signified
the replacement of church by state, faith by reason, religion by
science, intuition by experience and tradition by modernity, the
religious identity of salvation by othering evil (\" think continually
about death in order to avoid sin, because sin plus death will land you
in hell\" 17--so better beware of Jews, heretics, witches and
temptations of the flesh) was replaced by a hidden ambiguity of the
state. Since modernity's privileging of reason erased the possibility of
grounding social organisation in faith, it had to be propped up by
reason and the sovereign state as a anthropomorphic representation of
sovereign Man was offered as a resolution. But state identity cannot
easily be produced by reason alone. The problem was, however, that once
the \" death of God\" had been proclaimed, the link between the world,\"
man\" and certitude had been broken (Campbell 1992: 53). Thus ambiguity
prevailed in the modernist imperative that every presumption grounded in
faith be revealed by reason, and on the other hand, that the privileging
of modernity, the state, and reason itself is not possible without an
element of faith. In Campbell's (1992: 54) words: In this context of
incipient ambiguity brought upon by an insistence that can no longer be
grounded, securing identity in the form of the state requires an
emphasis on the unfinished and endangered nature of the world. In other
words, discourses of\" danger\" are central to the discourses of the\"
state\" and the discourses of\" man\". In place of the spiritual
certitude that provided the vertical intensity to support the horizontal
extenciveness of Christendom, the state requires discourses of\"
danger\" to provide a new theology of truth about who and what \" we\"
are by highlighting who and what\" we\" are not, and what\" we\" have to
fear. The mode through which the Campbellian discourse of danger is
employed in foreign (and security) policy, can then be seen as practices
of Wæverian securitisation. Securitisation is the mode of discourse and
the discourse is a\" discourse of danger\" identifying and naming
threats, thereby delineating Self from Other and thus making it clear
what it is\" we\" are protecting,(ie what is\" us\", what is our
identity and therefore--as representation--what is state identity). This
is done by pointing out danger, threats and enemies, internal and
external alike, and--by linking the two (Campbell 1992: 239): For the
state, identity can be understood as the outcome of exclusionary
practices in which resistant elements to a secure identity on the\"
inside\" are linked through a discourse of danger (such as Foreign
Policy) with threats identified and located on the\" outside\". [To
speak security is]{.underline} then to employ a discourse of danger
[inter-subjectively depicting that which is different from Self as an
existential threat]{.underline}--and therefore as Other to Self.
Securitisation is about the identity of that which is securitised on
behalf of, a discursive practice to (re) produce the identity of the
state. Securitising implies\" othering\" difference--making difference
the Other in a binary opposition constituting Self (Neumann 1996b: 167).
Turning to the Baltic Sea Region, one cannot help noting the rather
loose fitting between the undeniable--indeed underscored--state focus in
the works of both David Campbell and the Copenhagen School on the one
hand, and the somewhat wishful speculations of regionality beyond the
state--transcending sovereignty--on the other. Coupling the two is not
necessarily an analytical problem. It only makes a rather weak case for
regionality. But exactly that becomes a theoretical problem in
undermining the very theoretical substance, and by
implication--empirical viability--of regionality. There are of course
indications that the role of states are relativised in late modern (or
post- modern) politics. And there is reason to expect current
developments in the security problematique of the Baltic states--firmly
connected to the dynamic of NATO's enlargement--to exert an impact on
regional co-operation in the Baltic Sea Region, possibly even on
regionality. NATO moving east, engaging Russia and carrying elements of
the post-modernist security agenda with it in the process, is likely to
narrow the gap between the two agendas. Moreover, since the Baltic
states are not included in a first round of expansion, they might in
this very fact (failure, some would say) find an incentive for shifting
focus from international to regional levels. Involving Poland and
engaging Russia, the enlargement of NATO will in fact bring the Alliance
as such (not only individual NATO countries as the case has been) to
bear increasingly on the regional setting as well as on regional
activity. That might add significance to the regional level. It does
not, however, necessarily imply that the state as actor and state
centric approaches will succumb to regionality. Neither does it do away
with the state as the prime referent for, and producer of, collective
identity, so central to the approaches of both Wæver and Campbell. But
it might spur a parallel to sovereignty. A way out of this theoretical
impasse would then be not to stress the either or of
regionality/sovereignty, but to see the two as organising principles at
work side by side, complementing each other in parallelity rather than
excluding one another in contrariety. The Discourse of Danger. The
Russian war on Chechnya is one event that was widely interpreted in the
Baltic as a ominous sign of what Russia has in store for the Baltic
states (see Rebas 1996: 27; Nekrasas 1996: 58; Tarand 1996: 24; cf. Haab
1997). The constitutional ban in all three states on any kind of
association with post-Soviet political structures is indicative of a
**[[threat perception]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [confuses Soviet and
post- Soviet**, [conflating Russia with the USSR]{.mark}** and casting
everything Russian as **a t[hreat]{.mark}** through]{.underline} what
Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe (1985) call **[[a discursive\" chain
of equivalence]{.underline}]{.mark}**\". In this [the value of one side
in a binary opposition is [**reiterated** in other denotations of the
same binary opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [the value\" Russia\"
in a Russia/Europe-opposition is also denoted by\" instability\",\"
Asia\",\" invasion\", \" chaos\",\" incitement of ethnic minorities\",\"
unpredictability\",\" imperialism\",\" slander campaign\", \"
migration\", and so forth. [The **opposite value** of these
markers]{.mark}]{.underline} (\" stability\",\" Europe\",\" defence\",\"
order\", and so on) [[woul]{.mark}d]{.underline} then [**[denote the
Self and thus conjure up an identit]{.mark}y**. When identity is
precarious**, [this discursive practice intensifies by shifting onto a
security mode]{.mark}**, treating the oppositions as if they were
**questions [of political existence, sovereignty, and
survival]{.mark}**. Identity is (re) produced **more effectively** when
the oppositions are employed in a discourse of insecurity and
danger]{.underline}, that is, [made into questions of national security
and thus **securitised**]{.underline} in the Wæverian sense. Continues.
Reading Baltic literatures on security, one is not left in much doubt
that Russia is the organised political power,(ie the representation of
an anthropomorphic collective will). The Russian state is the danger to
the Baltic. [The danger of Russia is primarily seen as one of
encroachment--be it by ways of political or economic subversion, or by
downright military aggression--]{.underline}on their state sovereignty.
Conflating state and nation, everything Estonian, Latvian or Lithuanian
is thereby also threatened. [[The sheer size and might of Russia, and
the asymmetric power relations between Russia and the Baltic states
itself is **inscribed with danger**]{.mark}. The prevalent economic and
political instability in [Russia is **denoted as a threat in terms of
uncertainty and unpredictability**]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is,
**[in[stalled as one link in a discursive chain of equivalence casting
Russia as anarchy, the binary opposition to state
sovereignt]{.mark}y]{.underline}**. Baltic [state sovereignty is thus
[**underpinned by a discourse of danger** securitising culture]{.mark},
crime, diseases, alleged smear campaigns and possible invasions alike.
In this discourse of danger, [the current]{.mark} thaw and [policy
of]{.mark} liberal [reform in Russia is interpreted as a]{.mark} **mere
[parenthesis]{.mark}** in a brutal history of Russian imperialism, her
true nature, as it were. It is widely held]{.underline} among the Balts
[that [the imperial traditions in Russian foreign policy **might
resuscitate at any time**]{.mark} **and imminently pose a
threat**]{.underline} to the Baltic states. The bottom line of Baltic
threat perception and assessment is one of Russian coercive aggression.

Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, "What You See Is (Not) What You Get? The
Taiwan Question, Geo-economic Realities, and the "China Threat"
Imaginary," Antipode Journal, Wiley Online Library, JS)]{.underline}

[**[The identification of national-level threats]{.mark} is never
straightforward; it [is]{.mark} often [effected on emotional rather than
evidential grounds]{.mark}. Within the US, ["Japan bashing" emerged
during the]{.mark} 19[80s]{.mark} [vis-\`a-vis domestic fears of]{.mark}
the [waning economic competitivenes]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the US and its seeming inability to confront a "flexible" postFordist
future. More recently, [**the US decision in 2003 to attack
Iraq**]{.underline} on the premise that it possessed weapons of mass
destruction **[proved ultimately groundless: no such weapons were found,
while Iraq slipped into anarchy and arguably became a hotbed of
terrorist activities only since]{.underline}** (see Fallows 2006;
Gregory 2004; ´O Tuathail 2004). Mandel (2008:40) thus rightly cautions
how "\[[**t\]he political manipulation of enemy images by both
government officials and members of the mass public clouds over the
stark realities surrounding any international enemy
predicament**.]{.underline} Together, [**these patterns create** **both
ambiguity and confusion in dealing with the enemy component of global
threat**]{.underline}". In the context of this paper, the critical
question is whether a "China threat" imaginary is actually produced by
forces beyond China; whether what you see is indeed what you get.
[**Even though the US formally recognized the**]{.underline} People's
Republic of China ([**PRC) as a state**]{.underline} in 1979, [**the
recognition was**]{.underline} arguably **[conditioned by latent
suspicions]{.underline}**. As Feldman (2007:np) puts it, the Reagan
administration continued to "put little trust in Chinese promises to
adhere to a peaceful solution" regarding Taiwan even as it prepared to
sign the 1982 communiqu´e2 with China. **[This "little
trust",]{.underline}** Feldman (2007) adds, [**explains why Reagan gave
Taiwan "Six Assurances" and also inserted a secret memo in the National
Security Files noting that Taiwan's defensive capabilities must be
maintained at a level relative to China's.** **[Reagan's legacy of
"little trust]{.mark}" [seems to have permeated subsequent policy
considerations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 1999, the Pentagon presented
several scenarios in its "Asia 2025" study that portrayed China as the
most significant threat to American interests in the Asia-Pacific by
2025. A decade on, the US [**Defense Secretary Robert [Gates
offers]{.mark} this analysis of China:**]{.underline} In fact, when
considering the military-modernization programs of countries like China,
[**[we should be concerned]{.mark}**]{.underline} less with their
potential ability to challenge the US symmetrically---fighter to fighter
or ship to ship---and **[more [with their]{.mark} ability to disrupt our
freedom of movement and narrow our strategic options . . . [Investments
in cyber and anti-satellite warfare]{.mark}, anti-air and anti-ship
weaponry, and ballisticmissiles could threaten America's primary way to
project power and help allies in the Pacific]{.underline}**---in
particular our forward air bases and carrier strike groups (US
Department of Defense 16 September 2009)[. **Gates' geographical
imagination of China**]{.underline} in this speech **[is predicated on
two inter-related assumptions that exemplify a political realist "way of
seeing]{.underline}**". First, **[China is not recognized as an "ally"
of the US, although it is clear that the US is the key driver of such
politics of recognition in the first place.]{.underline}** Furthermore,
**[it appears that US military "protection" is a precondition to qualify
as an "ally", a logic which automatically casts states without such
"protection" as suspect]{.underline}**. Second, **[[China's
military-modernization process is ostensibly a "threat" because such
efforts could]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in Gates' terms, "[**[disrupt" the
"strategic options" of the US]{.mark}**]{.underline} in East Asia[,
**[even when it is entirely plausible that increased defense spending is
to fulfil other valid purposes,]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[such as
replacing obsolete military equipment to address new threats by
terrorists and maritime pirates, and enhancing remuneration packages for
soldiers.]{.underline}** Third, [**[America wants to "project power" on
its own terms]{.mark}, which is why it becomes "concerned" when
so-called non-allies upgrade their defence technologies. [This]{.mark}**
**point [is]{.mark} further [reaffirmed in the]{.mark} Pentagon's 2010**
**[Q]{.mark}**]{.underline}uadrennial **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**eview: "[**[lack of transparency and the
nature of China's military development]{.mark} [and decisionmaking
processes raise legitimate questions about its future conduct and
intention]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}]{.underline} within Asia and beyond"
(Pentagon 2010:60). However, [[the extent to which the questions are
"legitimate" is clearly a unilateral legal-discursive construction of
the US that reflects the enduring effect of political realism in US
security thought]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**[These assumptions]{.mark}
collectively [constitute]{.mark}**]{.underline} what Bialasiewicz et al
(2007; see also Lott 2004) call **[[America's "performative" security
strategy, through which perceived insecurities are constructed as
ontological facts so that "mitigation" measures could be
justified]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A critical assessment of the
motivations behind China's military modernization policies is thus
necessary before it can be ascertained whether a "China threat" exists.
First, while [**China**]{.underline} is not recognized as a US "ally",
it [**does not justify its defense modernization programs through
anti-US rhetoric.**]{.underline} For Chinese policymakers, it does
appear that the critical issue is protection and consolidation of its
existing territories (more on this in the third section). According to
Luo Yuan, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) and senior researcher with the Academy of Military
Sciences, "China is the only permanent member of the UN Security Council
that has not achieved territorial integrity . . . We need to think more
on how to preserve national integrity. We have no intention of
challenging the US" (China Daily 4 March 2010). **[In terms of defense
budget, China's increased 2010 budget, at around US\$78 billion, pales
in comparison to the proposed expenditure of the US of US\$700
billion.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[[the request for China to be
"transparent" in its defense policies is a double-standard]{.mark}s
practice [which undermines the sovereign right of a country]{.mark} to
devise its own policies, since the Pentagon is not the most
"transparent" or accountable where its own policies--- especially the
supposed "right" to launch pre-emptive strikes---are
concerned.]{.underline}** If anything, then**[, the massive "power gap"
between China and the US should suffice to allay concerns about the
former's so-called "threat]{.underline}**" (cf Al-Rodhan 2007). Second,
it is interesting that whilst not "allies" in name, **[the US and
Chinese economies are inextricably intertwined as the Chinese government
currently generates effective demand for US Treasury financial
instruments and holds significant US dollar reserves]{.underline}**. In
addition, [**[China's growing geo-economic influence worldwide is
contingent on a strategic investment]{.mark} of its foreign reserves,
[which means it has every economic incentive to ensure stability in the
global monetary system]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see discussion in Lim
2010). Within the US, however, [**[it is]{.mark}**]{.underline} possibly
**[[this]{.mark}]{.underline}** very geo-economic
[**[integration]{.mark}**]{.underline} with China (especially the US
Treasury's increasing dependence on Chinese financial capital and
China's importance as an offshore outsourcing destination for US
transnational corporations) [**[which triggers suspicions of China's
"intentions" and]{.mark} which then [generate certain reactive measures
to deflect attention from the US economy's deep-seated
problems]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In an insightful analysis, Cohen and
DeLong (2010:12--13) argue that the US has had a wonderful opportunity
to create new "sectors of the future" because of the willingness of
developing countries like China to lend it money; what was created,
however, was a finance sector that almost bankrupted the economy and
deepened the need for foreign backing to support its "quantitative
easing" monetary solution. **[Because the need to borrow more money from
abroad]{.underline}**---and China is so far the biggest
creditor---**[could lead to the end of the global politico-economic
influence of the US, it is perhaps unsurprising that some political
actors choose to politicize this phenomenon.]{.underline}** As Waltz
(2000:15) puts it, "With zero interdependence, neither conflict nor war
is possible. With integration, international becomes national politics".
Then again, [[**if China has no plausible economic motivation to engage
in military conflict with the US, the potential for conflict could be
attributed to the unilateral and sustained willingness of the US to
accede to Taiwan's arms purchase requests**,]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
knowledge that China views such arms sales as a clear show of support
for what it considers its own province. Intriguingly, the US framing of
its relations with Taiwan could actually be due to an implicit distrust
of putative allies in the East Asian region. Cha (2010:158) theorizes
post-World War II US geopolitical alliances with South Korea, Taiwan and
Japan as a form of bilateral "powerplay" designed to suppress not only
the Soviet threat, but also: to constrain anticommunist allies in the
region that might engage in aggressive behavior against adversaries that
could entrap the United States in an unwanted larger war. Underscoring
the U.S. desire to avoid such an outcome was a belief in the domino
theory---that the fall of one small country in Asia could trigger a
chain of countries falling to communism. This strategy arguably applies
in the present day, despite the demise of the Soviet Union and China's
peaceful integration into the global political economy. For instance,
Christensen (1999:50) sees [**US military presence in East Asia as
resolving a "security dilemma" triggered by a tendency for one country,
affected profoundly by "historically based mistrust",**]{.underline} to
overreact to another country's acquisition of ostensibly defensive
military equipment. What Christensen (1999) does not emphasize, however,
is that the US is also a major exporter of such equipment, which makes
the "powerplay" logic a doublethink ratiocination. This echoes Cowen and
Smith's (2009:42) **[[the geopolitical calculations of the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}**---exemplified through the unilaterally crafted
TRA and sustained arms sales to
Taiwan---**[[could]{.mark}]{.underline}** indirectly **[[destabilize the
"China region" and]{.mark} possibly even [Sino-US]{.mark} [geo-economic
formations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** aforementioned caveat that
"geopolitical calculation is always available when deemed necessary".
Even though the Cold War is officially over, Johnson's analysis (2005,
in Asia Times Online) strongly suggests that the "powerplay" approach
remains in full swing: **[Since the end of the Cold War in 1991, the
United States has repeatedly pressured Japan to revise Article 9 of its
constitution]{.underline}** (renouncing the use of force except as a
matter of self-defense) **[and become what US officials call a "normal
nation" . . . America's intention is to turn Japan into what Washington
neo-conservatives like to call the "Britain of the Far
East]{.underline}**"---and then use it as a proxy in checkmating North
Korea and balancing China.

when it comes to assessing "national" security threats, because threat
identification presupposes the "nation", as a collective group of
disparate citizens, would somehow be affected by such threats. This is
not easy, because addressing one "national" threat (eg state-to-state
military threat) may not correspond to the needs for other forms of
security (eg access to healthcare services, gainful employment etc**[).
[Erroneous threat imaginations could generate a self-fulfilling
prophecy]{.mark}---the supposed "threats which never were" might
actually turn real. [The challenge for accurate threat identifications
grows]{.mark} even [harder when]{.mark} [variegated]{.mark} doses of
[capitalist realism permeate foreign policymaking]{.mark} and lead to
the creation of transnational geo-economic configurations involving
putative geopolitical rivals.]{.underline}** In this paper, I have
illustrated how geopolitical calculations remain significant and might
be incommensurable with geo-economic conceptions of security that view
integrated, cross-border spaces of/for capital accumulation as a primary
precondition of political and social stability. [[**From China's foreign
policies over the past decade, it is evident that** **Chinese leaders
prefer carving**]{.mark} **open [space for economic development
to]{.mark} armed [conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The development of
East Asia into a dynamic and fast-growing region within the global
system of capitalism is significantly contingent on the Chinese
government's peace-oriented foreign and trade policies towards
neighboring countries. Since its politico-economic liberalization in
1979, **[China---]{.underline}**a distinct Cold War "enemy", together
with the nowdefunct Soviet Union---**[has demonstrated no ideological or
military hostility towards its regional neighbors and the US for the
past three decades]{.underline}**; tout au contraire, relations between
these nation-states have strengthened after the Cold War. More
significantly, **[China's stance towards North Korea's military
provocations]{.underline}**---notably its alleged sinking of a South
Korean warship and shelling of a South Korean island in March and
November 2010 respectively---[**have mutated from overt acceptance to
tacit tolerance, which reflects its importance as a strategic partner in
preventing violence**]{.underline} (especially nuclear warfare) on the
Korean peninsula. [**The emergence of new geo-economic formations
further complicates the picture**:]{.underline} both the US and Taiwan
are involved in geo-economic configurations with China, and all three
economies are experimenting with different forms of regulatory
structures that frees up economic space for flows of capital,
commodities and people. This corresponds with Cowen and Smith's
(2009:43) observation that "\[t\]he rise of geoeconomics does not
necessarily mean that boundaries and territories become less important,
but their strict national articulation may". On this evidence, [[**it

[**that [any assessment of a "threat]{.mark}"**]{.underline} from China

atomic bomb that leveled Hiroshima. n41 American nuclear submarines are
even more devastating. A single \[\*118\] submarine launched into
service in 1990, the Trident II Mk-5, can carry twenty-four submarine
launched ballistic missiles (\"SLBM\"), each of which contains eight
nuclear 475-kiloton warheads; one submarine can launch ninety-one
megatons worth of destruction, amounting to 341 times the punch packed
by Little Boy. n42 To put this in perspective, all of the explosives
used by all countries in World War II amounted to five megatons. n43 How
powerful is a one megaton blast that could be achieved by targeting all
three Minuteman III warheads on a single city? A one megaton blast over
London could be expected to kill 1.6 million people and to injure
another 3.2 million. n44 Another commentator estimates that a single
megaton nuclear bomb detonated one mile above a city would flatten
virtually every structure within a radius of four miles, and it would
heavily damage buildings within a radius of eight miles. . . . The
fireball . . . would produce at least third-degree burns on the body of
any person out in the open and within a radius of nine miles from the
center of the blast. Those closer to it would be incinerated if they
were not otherwise killed by the force of the explosion, the ensuing
winds, and the falling structures. n45 \$ Q In short, these weapons are
designed to be city killers. n46 At the peak of the Cold War, the United
States and the Soviet Union had thousands of such city killers aimed at
each other. n47 France and the United Kingdom had their own nuclear
arsenals, also aimed at the Soviet Union (and they were also targeted by
the Soviet Union). n48 Today, things look much different. The Soviet
Union has broken apart, and our former adversary, Russia, may well be

To be sure, there are historical grounds for scepticisms towards China's
recent military modernization. During the Cold War era, China (as the
PRC) was involved in several military conflicts with other states. The
three most significant wars fought by the PRC's military all occurred
then: namely, the Korean War from 1950 to 1953 (to assist its
beleaguered North Korean ally); the Sino-Indian war in 1962 (over two
disputed territories, Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh); and the
Sino-Vietnamese war in 1979 (as a response to Vietnam's invasion of
PRC-backed Cambodia). **[[For the past three decades]{.mark}, however,
[China has abstained from warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While the
Korean War is technically unresolved today and China still trades with
and provides aid to North Korea, analysts have noticed recent signs that
**[[Chinese support]{.mark} for [the]{.mark} cantankerous and capricious
[North Korean regime]{.mark}, based on former Cold War alliances, [is
increasingly conditional on the latter's commitment to peaceful
negotiations]{.mark} and renunciation of any warfare]{.underline}**
(Glaser 2009; Medeiros and Fravel 2003; Moore 2008). **[Diplomatic and
economic [relations between South Korea and China improved
significantly]{.mark} following the establishment of formal diplomatic
relations]{.underline}** in 1992, **[which adds further impetus to a
peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict. Similarly, [China's
relations with India, all Southeast Asian
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** (including its former warring foe
Vietnam**[) [and even Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}** (its former colonial
aggressor) **[[remain cordial]{.mark} in spite of their long-lasting
territorial disputes]{.underline}**.3 To Hyer (1995:42), **[[China's
contemporary reluctance to resort to military force is tied to its
growing connections with other states]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Despite
the fact that irredentist views are common among China's elite, **[[the
dynamics of the international system have forced the PRC to adopt
realistic policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** toward particular territorial
disputes . . . Although China has demonstrated that it considers
military force an option, in most cases **[[China has proved to be very
pragmatic]{.mark},]{.underline}** willing to compromise to establish
legitimate boundaries through peaceful negotiations. In other words,
**[[military warfare is]{.mark} arguably [a tool of last resort for
China]{.mark} when it comes to conflict resolution]{.underline}**; the
primary policy focus within China appears to be sustaining economic
development. Interestingly, then, much attention in media, policy and
academic circles has shifted focus to a "war" that China never
fought---a "war" across the Taiwan Strait.

## Deterrence

[The apotheosis of simulation:]{.underline} [The nuclear]{.underline}.
However, the balance of terror is never anything but the spectacular
slope of a system of deterrence that has inulated itself from the inside
into all the cracks of daily life. Nuclear suspension only serves to
seal [the]{.underline} trivialized [system of
**[deterrence]{.mark}**,]{.underline} that **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
at the heart of the media, of the violence without consequences that
reigns throughout the world, of the aleatory apparatus of all the
choices that are made for us. The most insignificant of our behaviors is
regulated by neutralized, indifferent, equivalent signs, by zero-sum
signs like those that regulate the "Strategy of games" (but the true
equation is elsewhere, and the unknown is precisely that variable of
simulation which makes of the atomic arsenal itself a hyperreal form, a
simulacrum that dominates everything and reduces all "ground-level"
events to being nothing but ephemeral scenarios, [**[transforming the

policy: into a policy **[that]{.mark}** already **[has no
value]{.mark}**. It is not the direct threat of atomic destruction that
paralyzes our lives, it is deterrence that gives them leukemia. And this
deterrence comes from that fact that even the real atomic clash is
precluded---precluded like the eventuality of the real in a system of
signs. The whole world pretends to believe in the reality of this threat
(this is understandable on the part of the military, the gravity of
their exercise and the discourse of their "strategy" are at stake), but
it is precisely at this level that there are no strategic stakes. **The
whole originality of the situation lies in the improbability of
destruction**. Deterrence precludes war\-\--the archaic violence of
expanding systems. **[Deterrence]{.mark} itself [is the neutral,
implosive violence]{.mark}** of metastable systems or systems in
involution. **[There is no longer a subject of deterrence]{.mark}**, nor
an adversary nor a strategy---**[it is a planetary structure of the
annihilation of stakes]{.mark}**. [Atomic war,]{.mark} like the Trojan
War, [will not take place.]{.mark} **[The risk of nuclear annihilation
only serves as a pretext]{.mark},** through the sophistication of
weapons (a sophistication that surpasses any possible objective to such
an extent that it is itself a system of nullity), **[for
installing]{.mark} a [universal security]{.mark}** system, a universal
**lockup and control [system, whose deterrent effect is]{.mark}**
[**not**]{.mark} at all **[aimed at an atomic clash]{.mark}** (which was
never in question, except without a doubt in the very initial stages of
the cold war, when one still confused the nuclear apparatus with
conventional war) but, rather,]{.underline} at the much greater
probability of any real event, of anything that would be an event in the
general system and upset its balance[. The balance of terror is the
terror of balance. Deterrence is not a strategy, it circulates and is
exchanged between nuclear protagonists exactly as is international
capital in the orbital zone of monetary speculation whose fluctuations
suffice to control all global exchanges. Thus, the money of destruction
without reference to real destruction, any more than floating capital
has a real referent of production) that circulates in nuclear orbit
suffices to control all the violence and potential conflicts around the
world. **[What is hatched]{.mark}** in the shadow of this mechanism with
the pretext of a maximal, "objective" threat, and thanks to Damocles'
nuclear sword, **[is the perfection of the best system of
control]{.mark}** that has ever existed. And the progressive
satellization **[of the whole planet]{.mark}** through this hypermodel
of security. The same goes for peaceful nuclear power stations.
[Pacification does not distinguish between the civil and the
military]{.mark}: everywhere where irreversible apparatuses of control
are elaborated, everywhere where the notion of security becomes
omnipotent, everywhere where the norm replaces the old arsenal of laws
and violence (including war), it is the system of deterrence that grows,
and around it grows the historical, social, and political desert. A
gigantic involution that makes every conflict, every finality, every
confrontation contract in proportion to this blackmail that interrupts,
neutralizes, freezes them all. No longer can any revolt, any story be
deployed according to its own logic because it risks annihilation. No
strategy is possible any longer, and escalation is only a puerile game
given over to the military. **[The political stake is dead, only
simulacra of conflicts and carefully circumscribed stakes
remain.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[**Massumi '2** (Brian, Associate Professor of Communications at the
Université de Montréal; Everywhere You Want to Be: An Introduction to
Fear; http://www.textz.com)]{.underline}

There is a kind of nonexclusive triage of bodies. Bodies are selected,
on the basis of certain socially-valorized distinctions, for priority
access to a certain kind of apparatus. African-American men, for
example, are favored for prison and the army on the basis of their skin
color. Women of all races are favored for biopower on the basis of
gender: the medicalization of child-birth and social engineering of the
child-rearing responsibilities women still disproportionately bear.
Priority access to one apparatus of actualization does not necessarily
exclude a body\'s selection by another. The same body can, inevitably
is, selected for different apparatuses successively and simultaneously.
Prison follows school follows family. Each of these disciplinary
institutions is penetrated by varying modes of biopower and testing. A
black woman\'s bodily functions are medicalized and at the same time
prioritized for disciplinary institutions. Generic identity is the
coincidence of functions that may in practice prove mutually exclusive
(capitalist and worker, producer and consumer, criminal and
banker)\--but then again may not. Specific identity involves a
separation of functions in their passage into practice, sometimes but
not necessarily with a view to exclusivity, often for mixing and
matching. The result is a complex weave of shifting social boundaries.
The boundaries are not barriers; they are not impermeable. They are more
like filters than walls. A black from the South Bronx may become a
big-time capitalist. But the chances are slim. Boundary-setting\--or the
separation/combination of social functions through a triage of bodies
based on valorized distinctions\--works less by simple exclusion than by
probability. The apparatuses of actualization governing this process are
power mechanisms. Power is not a form. It is not abstract. It is the
movement of form into the content outside of which it is a void of
potential function, of the abstract into the particular it cannot be or
do without. It is the translation of generic identity into the specific
identities outside whose actualization it does not exist, of humanity
into the selves comprising it. Not a form, but a mechanism of formation;
not a being, but a coming to being; a becoming. Neither generic nor
specific. Power is as ever-present as the subject-form and as infinitely
variable as its selves. It is neither one nor the other, and
nevertheless not indeterminate. It has definable modes, like the three
just mentioned, which are distinguished by the kinds of functions they
separate out for actualization in a given body (by the kind of socially
recognizable content they give a life). Power mechanisms can also be
defined, perhaps more fundamentally, by the temporal mode in which they
operate. They may seize upon the futurity of the future-past, in which
case they can be characterized as strategies of surveillance: on the
look-out for the event. Or they may seize upon its dimension of
anteriority, in which case they are statistical and probabilistic:
analyze and quantify the event as it happened. The past tense in the
Timex ad went along with a fixation on numbers: 85-foot fall, 2,500-foot
altitude, inches from the runway, 25-minute flight before landing, aged
52, 160-pound sled, 27 days and 345 miles, three blizzards \...
Mechanisms of surveillance and of statistical probabilization buckle
into prediction. [A power word for prediction is deterrence.
[**Deterrence is**]{.mark} the perpetual co-functioning of the past and
future of power: [**the empty present of watching and weighing**]{.mark}
with an eye to avert. [**It is the avoidance of**]{.mark} the
[**accident**]{.mark} on the basis of its past occurrence]{.underline}.
It is power turned toward the event: in other words, as it approaches
the subject-form, the virtual. Power under late capitalism is a
two-sided coin. One side of it faces the subject-form. On that side, it
is deterrence. [[**Deterrence**]{.mark} by nature [**determines nothing
(but**]{.mark} potential: [**the potential for the**]{.mark} multiform
[**disaster of**]{.mark} human **[existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}). On
the other side, power is determining. There, discipline,
**[[biopower]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and testing give disaster a face.
They [**[bring specificity to the general condition of possibility of
deterrence by applying it to a particular found body]{.mark}**. They
give a life-form content.]{.underline} A self is selected (produced and
consumed). The in-between of the subject-form and the self, of the
generic identity and specific identity\--the come and go between
deterrence and discipline/biopower/testing, between the virtual and the
actual\--is the same intensive and extensive terrain saturated by the
capitalist relation. Power is coincident with capital as social
selection and probabilistic control (Deleuze 1990). Power is
capitalization expressed as a destiny. [[**But in this postequilibrium
world of deterrence in which the accident is always about to happen and
already has, disorder is the motor of control. And destiny**]{.mark} in
the final analysis [**is only**]{.mark} the necessity of chance: [**the

### 2NC Deterrence---D-Rule

#### Nuclear deterrence is a commitment to pure revenge---moral obligation to vote negative 

[**Yin '3** (Tung, Professor at the University of Iowa College of Law,
Fall 2003, "Disposable Deontology: The Death Penalty and Nuclear
Deterrence," 55 Ala. L. Rev. 111, Lexis)]{.underline}

**[[The death penalty]{.mark} cannot be justified]{.underline}**, even
on the grounds claimed by some hon. Members. But it is also wrong in
principle. [It [is a response to evil that is **evil itself**]{.mark}.
[It is to act]{.mark}]{.underline}, as a society, [not in justice
but]{.underline} in [**anger**; not in reason but]{.underline} [**[for
revenge]{.mark}**. No matter how clothed it is in the legal process and
however much it is attended by all the trappings of the law, it cannot
disguise its real nature, which is **cruel and barbaric. [We do not
uphold the sanctity of human life by taking it]{.mark}**[, or]{.mark}
underline its precious nature by snuffing it out]{.underline}. In
essence, it appears that these nations believe that
**[[killing]{.underline}]{.mark}** someone **[[as
punishment]{.underline}]{.mark}** for that person\'s misdeeds, no matter
how heinous, **[[is a violation of \"human
dignity]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" This view is perhaps best illustrated
by the French government\'s protests concerning alleged \"20th
hijacker\" Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen who has been indicted
for \"conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism, to commit aircraft piracy,
to destroy aircraft, to use weapons of mass destruction, to murder U.S.
employees and to destroy property\" as part of the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks. n13 The French government has protested the fact that
Moussaoui could get the death penalty if convicted, but this protest is
not based on the belief that Moussaoui is innocent, that he will not get
a fair trial in the United States, or even that mitigating circumstances
might ultimately show that he does not deserve the death penalty even if
convicted. A spokesperson for the French Embassy stated: \"We\'re
confident the Americans will provide for a fair trial. But we oppose the
death penalty\--as do all the other countries of the European
Union\--whether it\'s against Mr. Moussaoui or anyone else. That\'s just
a general principle.\" n14 Or, as Danielle Mitterrand of France
explained, \[\*114\] \"Whatever the crime, believing in the abolition of
the death penalty is a philosophy of the mind and spirit. It can\'t
change depending on the circumstances.\" n15 Translating the position of
the other Western nations into traditional criminal law theory is not a
simple task; however, their opposition appears deontological, in the
sense of being based not on practical or consequentialist (i.e.,
utilitarian) rationales. n16 That is, they remain opposed, [even if one
could show that the death penalty served some utilitarian purpose (such
as deterrence).]{.underline} That [opposition]{.underline}, however,
[is]{.underline} flatly [**inconsistent** with]{.underline} the theory
of [nuclear deterrence]{.underline}, which these same countries rely on,
either directly, in the case of France and the United Kingdom (which are
armed with nuclear weapons), or indirectly, in the case of other U.S.
allies (who rely upon our nuclear umbrella). Sometimes known as \"mutual
assured destruction,\" [nuclear deterrence rests on the threat that a
country must retaliate against another country\'s civilian population in
response to a first strike. The idea]{.underline} of nuclear deterrence
[is that no one will]{.underline} launch a nuclear [attack because the
price of]{.underline} that attack\--[nuclear
retaliation]{.underline}\--[is too high to bear. The morally
questionable practice of targeting civilian populations is justified due
to the positive outcome of such a practice: the avoidance of nuclear
war]{.underline}. But [anyone accepting]{.underline} this [deterrence
theory must be]{.underline} open to [accepting capital
punishment]{.underline} if it were shown to have a positive outcome.
Moreover, [once deterrence fails, the act of retaliation cannot serve
any useful purpose: it cannot stop the first strike and,]{.underline}
thus, [cannot protect the target country]{.underline}. Therefore, [**any
country subscribing to [the theory of nuclear deterrence must be
prepared to retaliate for a first strike]{.mark}, [knowing that doing so
achieves no purpose other than retribution]{.mark}.** Retaliation cannot
stop the incoming missiles]{.underline}. Thus, **[any country willing to
accept the benefits of nuclear deterrence holds a moral framework that
is incompatible with an opposition to the death penalty.]{.underline}**
It may be that foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
Certainly, there is a danger in extolling consistency as its own
paramount value to the exclusion of what exactly it is that one is being
consistent about. n18 But if being consistent can be defined as
\"harmony, regularity, or steady continuity throughout,\" n19 and
consistency can be defined as \"harmony of conduct \[\*115\] or practice
with profession,\" n20 then it seems reasonable to put the burden on
those who are inconsistent to demonstrate that consistency would be
foolish. This is especially true in the specific comparison at issue
here, where the other Western nations are criticizing the United States
based on a rigid, morality-based principle. I do not argue, however,
that other Western nations possessing nuclear weapons (or relying upon
them) are obligated to use capital punishment. There are a number of
nondeontological reasons to abolish the death penalty, including the
fact that it costs more to try to impose a death sentence than to
imprison someone for life. And certainly other countries are free to be
inconsistent in governing themselves. But these nondeontological reasons
do not justify failure to cooperate in extraditing death-eligible
suspects to a country that retains the death penalty. I. Credible
Nuclear Deterrence The theory of nuclear war that developed during the
Cold War was known by its apt acronym \"MAD,\" which stood for \"mutual
assured destruction.\" n21 The idea behind MAD was that two nuclear
superpowers could maintain an uneasy and wary peace by promising to
respond to a nuclear attack with a massive retaliatory strike aimed at
annihilating the attacker\--especially its civilian population. n22 This
\"eye for an eye\" approach has a conceptual ease to it, and the fact
that the Cold War lasted for over forty years without an actual nuclear
incident between the United States and the former Soviet Union suggests
that it was effective. A. Mutual Assured Destruction and the Arms Race
MAD, however, did not come into being at the same time as the nuclear
bomb. Just after World War II, U.S. military plans called for the use of
nuclear weapons for what might have been considered non-retaliatory
purposes. n23 Because the former Soviet Union and its allies had
military forces \[\*116\] that greatly outnumbered those of the United
States and its allies in Europe, \"it was thought, reasonably enough,
that the only way to halt an invasion of Western Europe was to destroy
the Soviet armies before they could overrun the continent.\" n24 In
other words, the United States was prepared to drop nuclear bombs on the
Soviet army if it tried to invade Western Europe. Thus, in 1948, when
the United States had about fifty nuclear bombs and the Soviet Union had
none, the nuclear weapons were aimed at military, industrial, or
transportation targets; civilian casualties were expected but not
intended. n25 Even in 1950, when the United States had somewhere between
292 and 688 atomic bombs, the explosive yield of such bombs was small
enough and the delivery mechanism\--basically the same as was used in
World War II (bombers)\--was uncertain enough that the United States
could not even be sure of destroying Moscow, much less the whole of the
Soviet Union. n26 This policy began to mutate in 1954, when Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles declared that the United States would respond
to Soviet provocation by launching \"massive retaliation,\" which
everyone understood to mean \"a full-scale nuclear attack.\" n27 The
critical catalyst for this policy change was the development of the
hydrogen bomb in 1952. n28 The hydrogen bomb packs about a hundred to a
thousand times the destructive power of the atomic bomb. n29 Once the
United States perfected the hydrogen bomb, it solved the problem of not
being able to ensure the destruction of Moscow\--and much more. Of
course, the Soviet Union did not lag behind for long, and it built a
hydrogen bomb in 1955. n30 By the 1960s, the United States and the
Soviet Union had both developed intercontinental ballistic missiles
(\"ICBMs\"), which could be launched from one side of the world and hit
a target on the other side. n31 And as technology improved and more
potent weapons were developed, the amount of warning time a superpower
could expect to have shrunk to only a few minutes. n32 Submarines, for
example, could park just outside an enemy country\'s \[\*117\] waters
and lob nuclear missiles with virtually no warning at all. n33 To be
able to implement MAD under these conditions, a superpower needed to
have enough of its own nuclear weapons such that even if it were
devastated by a nuclear strike, it would still be able to strike back.
This became known as \"second strike capability,\" which drove the
United States and the former Soviet Union to build more and more nuclear
weapons. n34 In 1962, for example, the United States\' nuclear strategy,
embodied in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (\"SIOP\"), called
for the launching of all American nuclear weapons in the event of a
nuclear war started by the Soviet Union. n35 An estimated 360 million to
525 million Russians and Chinese (who were also targeted) would die. n36
The image of a mushroom-shaped cloud rising above a devastated city is
familiar to just about everyone today. The image, however, fails to
convey the awesomely destructive potential of nuclear weapons. A nuclear
blast similar in size to the one at Hiroshima would kill or injure
people and destroy buildings due to (1) the incredible heat of the
fireball, which would melt or vaporize everything close to it, (2) the
overwhelming blast wave, which would strike \"as a sudden and shattering
blow, immediately followed by a hurricane-force wind directed outwards
from the explosion,\" n37 and (3) neutron and gamma rays that would
induce fatal radiation sickness at distances up to three-quarters of a
mile or more. n38 That qualification (a Hiroshima-sized bomb) is crucial
to understanding how destructive today\'s nuclear weapons can be. The
atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima had an explosive yield of 13.5
kilotons, or the equivalent of 13,500 tons of TNT. n39 By contrast, a
United States\' Minuteman III Mk-12A ICBM in service today carries three
nuclear warheads, n40 each with an explosive yield of 335 kilotons,
meaning that a single ICBM packs approximately 17.4 times the
destructive power of the atomic bomb that leveled Hiroshima. n41
American nuclear submarines are even more devastating. A single
\[\*118\] submarine launched into service in 1990, the Trident II Mk-5,
can carry twenty-four submarine launched ballistic missiles (\"SLBM\"),
each of which contains eight nuclear 475-kiloton warheads; one submarine
can launch ninety-one megatons worth of destruction, amounting to 341
times the punch packed by Little Boy. n42 To put this in perspective,
all of the explosives used by all countries in World War II amounted to
five megatons. n43 How powerful is a one megaton blast that could be
achieved by targeting all three Minuteman III warheads on a single city?
A one megaton blast over London could be expected to kill 1.6 million
people and to injure another 3.2 million. n44 Another commentator
estimates that a single megaton nuclear bomb detonated one mile above a
city would flatten virtually every structure within a radius of four
miles, and it would heavily damage buildings within a radius of eight
miles. . . . The fireball . . . would produce at least third-degree
burns on the body of any person out in the open and within a radius of
nine miles from the center of the blast. Those closer to it would be
incinerated if they were not otherwise killed by the force of the
explosion, the ensuing winds, and the falling structures. n45 \$ Q In
short, these weapons are designed to be city killers. n46 At the peak of
the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union had thousands of
such city killers aimed at each other. n47 France and the United Kingdom
had their own nuclear arsenals, also aimed at the Soviet Union (and they
were also targeted by the Soviet Union). n48 Today, things look much
different. The Soviet Union has broken apart, and our former adversary,
Russia, may well be invited to join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (\"NATO\")\--the organization whose very existence was
predicated on a joint alliance against the Soviet Union. n49 \[\*119\]
One can legitimately ask whether MAD is still appropriate now that the
Cold War has ended. As the current \"war on terrorism\" demonstrates,
our greatest threat may come from non-state terrorist groups such as Al
Qaeda, rather than another nation-state. If we do not need to worry
about preemptive nuclear strikes from other countries, do we still need
MAD? A large scale nuclear weapon such as an ICBM, which has the purpose
of destroying entire cities, is generally too unwieldy to use against
non-state actors. n50 Perhaps MAD can be relegated to the trashbin of
ideas that once seemed good but that have outlived their usefulness,
like Niels Bohr\'s model of the hydrogen atom. But countries such as
Iran, North Korea, and any others seeking to join the nuclear weapons
club are probably still deterred by MAD. n51 Some believe that Saddam
Hussein opted not to use any weapons of mass destruction in the Gulf War
in 1991 because the United States had warned \"Iraq\'s foreign minister
that any use of nonconventional weapons would seal Iraq\'s
destruction.\" n52 North Korea\'s recent decision to withdraw from the
Nonproliferation Treaty and to reactivate its nuclear weapons program
further demonstrates the continued need for nuclear deterrence, n53
especially as North Korea\'s defection may tempt other rogue nations to
follow suit. n54 If the world is due for an increase in nuclear
proliferation, particularly among the least stable countries (and
perhaps the ones most likely to use nuclear weapons to blackmail the
world into acceding to their demands), we may be forced to continue to
rely on MAD (or at least, assured destruction) in the future. n55 B.
Moral Implications of MAD There are two very disturbing implications
about MAD. First, [[MAD is predicated upon the concept of countries\'
**holding each other\'s civilian populations
hostage**]{.underline}.]{.mark} The [fact that MAD appears to have
kept]{.underline} the [peace]{.underline} for over fifty years, one
commentator asserts, \"**[blinds us to the fact that [our method for
preventing nuclear war]{.mark} [rests on]{.mark} a form of warfare
universally condemned since the Dark Ages\--[the mass killing of
hostages]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\" In other words, one can plausibly
argue that [even if a nuclear power has no real intention of retaliating
against an adversary with a nuclear strike**, [simply threatening the
innocent civilians]{.mark} of the adversarial nation [is
immoral.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

## Hegemony

### Link---Hegemony---1NC 

#### Hegemony is a paranoid fantasy---this fantasy of omnipotence sees threats to empire everywhere, which necessitates constant violence---you have an obligation to place the structural violence that hegemony invisibilizes at the core of your decision calculus

[By now it is fair to say that **[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has come to be dominated by]{.mark} [two]{.mark}**
grand and [dangerous hallucinations]{.mark}**: [the promise of]{.mark}
benign US [globalization]{.mark} [and the]{.mark} permanent [threat of
the "war on terror]{.mark}."** I have come to feel that **we cannot
understand the extravagance of the violence to which the US government
has committed itself after 9/11**---two countries invaded, thousands of
innocent people imprisoned, killed, and tortured---**unless we grasp a
defining feature of our moment,** that is, **a deep and disturbing
doubleness with respect to power. [Taking shape]{.mark},** as it now
does, **[around fantasies of global omnipotence]{.mark}** (Operation
Infinite Justice, the War to End All Evil) coinciding with nightmares of
impending attack, **[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has
entered the domain of ]{.mark}**paranoia: **[dream world and
catastrophe]{.mark}**. **For** [it is only in paranoia]{.mark} **[that
one finds]{.mark} [simultaneously]{.mark} and in such condensed form
[both deliriums of absolute power and]{.mark} forebodings of [perpetual
threat]{.mark}.** Hence the spectral and nightmarish quality of the "war
on terror," a limitless war against a limitless threat, a war vaunted by
the US administration to encompass all of space and persisting without
end. But the war on terror is not a real war, for "terror" is not an
identifiable enemy nor a strategic, real-world target. **[The war on
terror]{.mark} [is]{.mark} what William Gibson calls elsewhere "[a
consensual hallucination]{.mark},"4 and [the US]{.mark} government [can
fling its military might against]{.mark} [ghostly apparitions and
hallucinate]{.mark} [a victory over all evil]{.mark} only** [at the cost
of]{.mark} [catastrophic self-delusion]{.mark} [and the infliction of
great calamities elsewhere]{.mark}**.** I have come to feel that **[we
urgently need to make visible]{.mark}** (the better politically to
challenge) **those established but [concealed circuits of imperial
violence]{.mark} that now animate the war on terror**. **[We
need]{.mark}**, as urgently, **[to illuminate the continuities that
connect those circuits of imperial violence abroad with the vast,
internal shadowlands of prisons and supermaxe]{.mark}s**---the modern
"slave-ships on the middle passage to nowhere"---[**that have come to
characterize the United States as a super-carceral state**.]{.mark}5 Can
we, the uneasy heirs of empire, now speak only of national things? If a
long-established but primarily covert US imperialism has, since 9/11,
manifested itself more aggressively as an overt empire, does the terrain
and object of intellectual inquiry, as well as the claims of political
responsibility, not also extend beyond that useful fiction of the
"exceptional nation" to embrace the shadowlands of empire? If so, how
can we theorize the phantasmagoric, imperial violence that has come so
dreadfully to constitute our kinship with the ordinary, but which also
at the same moment renders extraordinary the ordinary bodies of ordinary
people, an imperial violence which in collusion with a complicit
corporate media would render itself invisible, casting states of
emergency into fitful shadow and fleshly bodies into specters? **[For
imperialism is not something that happens elsewhere,]{.mark} an offshore
fact to be deplored but as easily ignored. Rather, [the force of empire
comes to reconfigure]{.mark}**, from within, **[the nature and violence
of the nation-state itself]{.mark}**, giving rise to perplexing
questions: Who under an empire are "we," the people? And who are the
ghosted, ordinary people beyond the nation-state who, in turn,
constitute "us"? **[We now inhabit a crisis of violence and the
visible]{.mark}**. How do we insist on seeing the violence that the
imperial state attempts to render invisible, while also seeing the
ordinary people afflicted by that violence? For **[to allow the
spectral]{.mark}**, **disfigured people** (especially those under
torture) **obliged to inhabit the haunted no-places and penumbra of
empire [to be made visible]{.mark} as ordinary people [is to forfeit
the]{.mark} long-held US [claim of]{.mark} moral and cultural
[exceptionalism]{.mark}, the traditional self-identity of the United
States as the uniquely superior, universal standard-bearer of moral
authority, a tenacious, national mythology of originary innocence** now
in tatters. The deeper question, however, is not only how to see but
also how to theorize and oppose the violence without becoming beguiled
by the seductions of spectacle alone.6 Perhaps in [the labyrinths of
torture we must also find a way to speak with ghosts]{.mark}, for
specters disturb the authority of vision [and the hauntings of popular
memory disrupt the great forgettings of official history]{.mark}. Why
paranoia? Can we fully understand the proliferating circuits of imperial
violence---the very eclipsing of which gives to our moment its uncanny,
phantasmagoric cast---without understanding the pervasive presence of
the paranoia that has come, quite violently, to manifest itself across
the political and cultural spectrum as a defining feature of our time?
By paranoia, I mean not simply Hofstadter's famous identification of the
US state's tendency toward conspiracy theories.7 Rather, **[I conceive
of paranoia as]{.mark} an inherent contradiction with respect to power:
[a double-sided phantasm]{.mark} [that oscillates precariously]{.mark}
[between deliriums]{.mark} of grandeur and nightmares of perpetual
threat, a deep and dangerous doubleness with respect to power [that is
held in unstable tension]{.mark}**, **but which, [if suddenly
destabilized]{.mark}** (as after 9/11), [can produce pyrotechnic]{.mark}
displays of [violence.]{.mark} The pertinence of understanding paranoia,
I argue, lies in its peculiarly intimate and peculiarly dangerous
relation to violence.8 Let me be clear: I do not see paranoia as a
primary, structural cause of US imperialism nor as its structuring
identity. Nor do I see the US war on terror as animated by some
collective, psychic agency, submerged mind, or Hegelian "cunning of
reason," nor by what Susan Faludi calls a national "terror dream."9 Nor
am I interested in evoking paranoia as a kind of psychological diagnosis
of the imperial nation-state. Nations do not have "psyches" or an
"unconscious"; only people do. Rather, a social entity such as an
organization, state, or empire can be spoken of as "paranoid" if the
dominant powers governing that entity cohere as a collective community
around contradictory cultural narratives, self-mythologies, practices,
and identities that oscillate between delusions of inherent superiority
and omnipotence, and phantasms of threat and engulfment. The term
paranoia is analytically useful here, then, not as a description of a
collective national psyche, nor as a description of a universal
pathology, but rather as an analytically strategic concept, a way of
seeing and being attentive to contradictions within power, a way of
making visible (the better politically to oppose) the contradictory
flashpoints of violence that the state tries to conceal. Paranoia is in
this sense what I call a hinge phenomenon, articulated between the
ordinary person and society, between psychodynamics and socio-political
history. **Paranoia is in that sense dialectical rather than binary, for
its violence erupts from the force of its multiple, cascading
contradictions:** the intimate memories of wounds, defeats, and
humiliations condensing with cultural fantasies of aggrandizement and
revenge, in such a way as to be productive at times of unspeakable
violence. For how else can we understand such debauches of cruelty? A
critical question still remains: does not something terrible have to
happen to ordinary people (military police, soldiers, interrogators) to
instill in them, as ordinary people, in the most intimate, fleshly ways,
a paranoid cast that enables them to act compliantly with, and in
obedience to, the paranoid visions of a paranoid state? Perhaps **we
need to take a long, hard look at the simultaneously humiliating and
aggrandizing rituals of militarized institutions, whereby individuals
are first broken down, then reintegrated** (incorporated) **into the
larger corps as a unified, obedient fighting body, the methods by which
schools, the military, training camps**--- not to mention the paranoid
image-worlds of the corporate media---**[instill paranoia in ordinary
people and fatally conjure up collective but unstable fantasies of
omnipotence]{.mark}**.10 In what follows, I want to trace the
flashpoints of imperial paranoia into the labyrinths of torture in order
to illuminate three crises that animate our moment: the crisis of
violence and the visible, the crisis of imperial legitimacy, and what I
call "the enemy deficit." I explore these flashpoints of imperial
paranoia as they emerge in the torture at Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib. I
argue that Guantánamo is the territorializing of paranoia and that
torture itself is paranoia incarnate, in order to make visible, in
keeping with Hazel Carby's brilliant work, those contradictory sites
where imperial racism, sexuality, and gender catastrophically collide.11
C. P. Cavafy wrote "Waiting for the Barbarians" in 1927, but the poem
haunts the aftermath of 9/11 with the force of an uncanny and prescient
déjà vu. To what dilemma are the "barbarians a kind of solution?
**[Every modern empire faces an abiding crisis of legitimacy in that it
flings its power over territories and peoples who have not consented to
that power]{.mark}.** Cavafy's insight is that **[an imperial state
claims legitimacy]{.mark}** [only]{.mark} **[by evoking the threat
of]{.mark} the [barbarians]{.mark}**. It is only the threat of the
barbarians that constitutes the silhouette of the empire's borders in
the first place. On the other hand[, **the hallucination of the
barbarians disturbs the empire with perpetual nightmares of impending
attack**]{.mark}. **The enemy is the abject of empire: the rejected from
which we cannot part**. And **[without]{.mark} the [barbarians]{.mark}
the [legitimacy]{.mark} of empire [vanishes]{.mark} like a disappearing
phantom**. Those people were a kind of solution. **[With the collapse of
the Soviet Union]{.mark}** in December 1991, **[the grand antagonism of
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and the USSR
[evaporated]{.mark} like a quickly fading nightmare**. **The [cold war
rhetoric]{.mark} of totalitarianism, Finlandization, present danger,
fifth columnist, and infiltration [vanished]{.mark}.** Where were the
enemies now to justify the continuing escalation of the military
colossus? "And now what shall become of us without any barbarians?" By
rights, [**the thawing of the cold war should have prompted** an
immediate downsizing of the military]{.mark}**; any plausible external
threat had simply ceased to exist**. Prior to 9/11, **[General]{.mark}**
Peter **[Schoomake]{.mark}**]{.underline}[r]{.mark}[, head of the US
Army, **bemoaned the enemy deficit: ["It's no use having an army that
did nothing but train]{.mark}," he said[. "There's got to be a certain
appetite for what the hell we exist for.]{.mark}"** Dick Cheney likewise
complained: **["The threats have become so remote. So remote that they
are difficult to ascertain."]{.mark}** Colin Powell agreed: **["Though
we can still plausibly identify specific threats]{.mark}**---North
Korea, Iran, Iraq, something like that---[the real threat is the
unknown**, the uncertain.**]{.mark}" Before becoming president, George
W. Bush likewise fretted over the post--cold war dearth of a visible
enemy: "We do not know who the enemy is, but we know they are out
there." It is now well established that the invasion of Iraq had been a
long-standing goal of the US administration, but there was no clear
rationale with which to sell such an invasion. In 1997 a group of
neocons at the Project for the New American Century produced a
remarkable report in which they stated that to make such an invasion
palatable would require "a catastrophic and catalyzing event---like a
new Pearl Harbor."12 **[The 9/11 attacks]{.mark} [came as a dazzling
solution]{.mark}, both [to the enemy deficit and the problem of
legitimacy, offering the Bush administration]{.mark} what they would
claim as [a political casus belli and the military unimaginable license
to expand its reach]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} General Peter Schoomaker would
publicly admit that the attacks were an immense boon: "There is a huge
silver lining in this cloud. . . . **War is a tremendous focus**. . . .
**Now we have this focusing opportunity, and we have the fact that
(terrorists) have actually attacked our homeland,** which gives it some
oomph." In his book Against All Enemies, Richard Clarke recalls thinking
during the attack, "Now we can perhaps attack Osama Bin Laden." After
the invasion of Afghanistan, Secretary of State **Colin Powell noted,
"[America will have a continuing interest and presence in Central Asia
of a kind we could not have dreamed of before]{.mark}**." Charles
Krauthammer, for one, called for a declaration of total war. "We no
longer have to search for a name for the post-Cold War era," he
declared. "It will henceforth be known as the age of
terrorism."13]{.underline}

All these years, **[we've been launching wars and pursuing a "global war
on terror]{.underline}**." **[We've poured money into national security
as if there were no tomorrow.]{.underline}** From our police to our
borders, we've up-armored everywhere**[[. We constantly hear about
"threats" to us and to the "homeland]{.mark}." [And
yet]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[when you knock on the door marked
"Enemy," there's seldom anyone home]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Few in this
country have found this striking. **[[Few seem to notice any disjuncture
between the enemy-ridden,]{.mark} threatening, and deeply dangerous
[world we have been preparing]{.mark} ourselves
[for]{.mark}]{.underline}** (and fighting in) this last decade-plus
**[[and the world as it actually is]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[even
those who lived through significant parts of the last
anxiety-producing]{.underline}**, bloody **[century]{.underline}**. You
know that feeling when you wake up and realize you've had the same
recurrent nightmare yet again? Sometimes, there's an equivalent in
waking life, and here's mine: every now and then, as I read about the
next move in the spreading war on terror, the next drone assassination,
the next ratcheting up of the surveillance game, the next expansion of
the secrecy that envelops our government, the next set of expensive
actions taken to guard us --- all of this justified by the enormous
threats and dangers that we face --- I think to myself: **[[Where's the
enemy?]{.underline}]{.mark}** And then I wonder[: **[Just what kind of a
dream is this that we're dreaming?]{.underline}**]{.mark} A Door Marked
"Enemy" and No One Home Let's admit it: **[[enemies can have their
uses]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And let's admit as well **[[that it's in
the interest of some in our country that we be seen as surrounded
by]{.mark} constant and imminent dangers on [an enemy-filled
planet]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Let's also admit that **[the world is and
always will be a dangerous place in all sorts of ways.]{.underline}**
Still, in American terms**[, the bloodlettings, [the devastations of
this new century and the last years of the previous one have been
remarkably minimal or distan]{.mark}]{.underline}**[t]{.mark}; some of
**[the worst, as in [the multi-country war over the Congo with its more
than five million dead have passed us by
entirely]{.mark}]{.underline}**; some, **[even when we launched them,
have essentially been imperial frontier conflicts,]{.underline}** as in
Iraq and Afghanistan**[, or interventions of little cost]{.underline}**
**[(to us)]{.underline}** as in Libya, or frontier patrolling operations
as in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and Northern Africa. (It was no mistake
that, when Washington launched its special operations raid on
Abbottabad, Pakistan, to get Osama bin Laden, it was given the code name
"Geronimo" and the message from the SEAL team recording his death was
"Geronimo-E KIA" or "enemy killed in action.") And let's admit as well
that, in **[the [wake of those wars and operations, Americans now have
more enemies,]{.mark}]{.underline}** more angry, embittered people who
would like to do us harm than on September 10, 2001. Let's accept that
somewhere out **[[there are people who]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as George
W. Bush once liked to say, "**[[hate us"]{.underline}]{.mark}** and what
we stand for. (I leave just what we actually stand for to you, for the
moment.) So let's consider those enemies briefly. **[[Is there a major
state]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for instance, **[[that falls into this
category]{.mark},]{.underline}** like any of the great warring imperial
European powers from the sixteenth century on, or Nazi Germany and
Imperial Japan in World War II, or the Soviet Union of the Cold War era?
**[[Of course not.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There was admittedly a period
when, in order to pump up what we faced in the world, analogies to World
War II and the Cold War were rife. There was, for instance, George W.
**[Bush's famed rhetorical construct, the Axis of Evil]{.underline}**
(Iraq, Iran, and North Korea**[), patterned by his speechwriter on the
German-Italian-Japanese "axis" of World War II. It was]{.underline}**,
of course, **[a joke construct, if reality was your
yardstick]{.underline}**. **[Iraq and Iran were then
enemies]{.underline}**. (Only **[in the wake of the U.S. invasion and
occupation of Iraq have they become friends]{.underline}** and allies.)
**[And North Korea had nothing whatsoever to do with either of
them]{.underline}**. Similarly, **[the American occupation of Iraq was
once regularly compared to the U.S. occupations of Germany and
Japan]{.underline}**, just as Saddam Hussein had long been presented as
a modern Hitler. In addition, **[al-Qaeda-style Islamists were regularly
referred to as Islamofascists]{.underline}**, **[while certain military
and neocon types with a desire to turn the war on terror into a
successor to the Cold War took to calling it "the long
war,"]{.underline}** or even "World War IV." But all of this was so
wildly out of whack that it simply faded away. As for who's behind that
door marked "Enemy," if you opened it, what would you find? As a start,
**[scattered hundreds]{.underline}** or, as the years have gone by,
thousands **[of jihadis, mostly in the poorest backlands of the planet
and with little ability to do anything to the United
States]{.underline}**. Next, t**[here were a few minority
insurgencies,]{.underline}** including the Taliban and allied forces in
Afghanistan and separate Sunni and Shia ones in Iraq. **[There also have
been tiny numbers of wannabe Islamic terrorists in the
U.S.]{.underline}** (once you take away the string of FBI sting
operations that have regularly turned hopeless slackers and lost
teenagers into the most dangerous of fantasy Muslim plotters). **[And
then]{.underline}**, of course, **[there are those two relatively
hapless regional powers, Iran and North Korea, whose bark far exceeds
their potential bite.]{.underline}** The Wizard of Oz on 9/11 **[The
U.S.]{.underline}**, in other words, **[is [probably in less danger from
external enemies than at any moment in the last
century]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[There is no other imperial power on
the planet capable of]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** or
desirous [of, **[taking on American power directly, including
China.]{.underline}**]{.mark} It's true that, on September 11, 2001, 19
hijackers with box cutters produced a remarkable, apocalyptic, and
devastating TV show in which almost 3,000 people died. When those giant
towers in downtown New York collapsed, it certainly had the look of
nuclear disaster (and in those first days, the media was filled was
nuclear-style references), but it wasn't actually an apocalyptic event.
The enemy was still nearly nonexistent. The act cost bin Laden only an
estimated \$400,000-\$500,000, though it would lead to a series of
trillion-dollar wars**[. It was a nightmarish event that had a malign
Wizard of Oz quality to it: a tiny man producing giant effects. It in no
way endangered the state.]{.underline}** In fact, it would actually
strengthen many of its powers. It put a hit on the economy, but a
passing one. It was a spectacular and spectacularly gruesome act of
terror by a small, murderous organization then capable of mounting a
major operation somewhere on Earth only once every couple of years. It
was meant to spread fear, but nothing more. When the towers came down
and you could suddenly see to the horizon, it was still, in historical
terms, remarkably enemy-less. And yet 9/11 was experienced here as a
Pearl Harbor moment --- a sneak attack by a terrifying enemy meant to
disable the country. The next day, newspaper headlines were filled with
variations on "A Pearl Harbor of the Twenty-First Century." If it was a
repeat of December 7, 1941, however, it lacked an imperial Japan or any
other state to declare war on, although one of the weakest partial
states on the planet, the Taliban's Afghanistan, would end up filling
the bill adequately enough for Americans. **[To put this in perspective,
consider two obvious major dangers in U.S. life: suicide by gun and
death by car.]{.underline}** In 2010, more than 19,000 Americans killed
themselves using guns. (In the same year, there were "only" 11,000
homicides nationwide.) In 2011, 32,000 Americans died in traffic
accidents (the lowest figure in 60 years, though it was again on the
rise in the first six months of 2012). In other words, [**[Americans
accept without blinking the equivalent yearly of more than six 9/11s in
suicides-by-gun and more than 10 when it comes to vehicular
death]{.underline}**s]{.mark}. Similarly, had the underwear bomber,
**[to take one post-9/11 example of terrorism, succeeded in downing
Flight 253 and murdering its 290 passengers, it would have been a
horrific act of terror; but he and his compatriots would have had to
bring down 65 planes to reach the annual level of weaponized suicides
and more than 110 planes for vehicular deaths.]{.underline}** And
**[[yet no one has declared war on either the car or the
gun]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or the companies that make them or the
people who sell them). **[No one has built a massive, nearly
trillion-dollar car-and-gun-security-complex to deal with
them.]{.underline}** **[In the case of guns]{.underline}**, quite **[the
opposite is true, as the post-Newtown debate over gun control has made
all too clear.]{.underline}** On both scores, **[[Americans have decided
to live with perfectly real dangers and the staggering carnage that
accompanies them]{.mark},]{.underline}** constraining them on occasion
or sometimes not at all. Despite the carnage of 9/11, terrorism has been
a small-scale American danger in the years since, worse than shark
attacks, but not much else. Like a wizard, however, what Osama bin Laden
and his suicide bombers did that day was create an instant sense of an
enemy so big, so powerful, that Americans found "war" a reasonable
response; big enough for those who wanted an international police action
against al-Qaeda to be laughed out of the room; big enough to launch an
invasion of revenge against Iraq, a country unrelated to al-Qaeda; big
enough, in fact, to essentially declare war on the world. It took next
to no time for top administration officials to begin talking about
targeting 60 countries, and as journalist Ron Suskind has reported,
within six days of the attack, the CIA had topped that figure,
presenting President Bush with a "Worldwide Attack Matrix," a plan that
targeted terrorists in 80 countries. What's remarkable is how little the
disjuncture between the scope and scale of the global war that was
almost instantly launched and the actual enemy at hand was ever noted
here. You could certainly make a reasonable argument that, in these
years, Washington has largely fought no one --- and lost. **[Everywhere
it went, it created enemies who had, previously, hardly existed and the
process is ongoing.]{.underline}** Had you been able to time-travel back
to the Cold War era to inform Americans that, in the future, our major
enemies would be in Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Mali, Libya, and so on,
they would surely have thought you mad (or lucky indeed). Creating an
Enemy-Industrial Complex **[[Without an enemy of commensurate size and
threat]{.mark}, so much that was done in Washington in these years might
have been unattainable]{.underline}**. The **[vast national security
building and spending spree ---]{.underline}** stretching from the
Virginia suburbs of Washington, where the National
Geospatial-Intelligence Agency erected its new \$1.8 billion
headquarters, to Bluffdale, Utah, where the National Security Agency is
still constructing a \$2 billion, one-million-square-foot data center
for storing the world's intercepted communications --- **[would have
been unlikely.]{.underline}** **[Without the fear of an enemy capable of
doing anything, money at ever escalating levels would never have poured
into homeland security, or the Pentagon, or a growing complex of crony
corporations associated with our weaponized safety.]{.underline}**
[**[The exponential growth of the national security complex, as well as
of the powers of the executive branch when it comes to national security
matters,]{.underline}** **[would have far been less
likely]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[Without 9/11 and the perpetual
"wartime" that followed, along with the heavily promoted threat of
terrorists ready to strike and potentially capable of wielding
biological, chemical, or even nuclear weapons, we would have no
Department of Homeland Security nor the lucrative mini-homeland-security
complex]{.underline}** that surrounds it; the 17-outfit U.S.
Intelligence Community with its massive \$75 billion official budget
would have been far less impressive; **[[our endless drone wars and the
"drone lobby" that goes with them might never have developed]{.mark};
[and the U.S. military would not have an ever growing secret military,

[C]{.mark}ommand, gestating inside it --- [effectively the president's
private army]{.mark},]{.underline}** air force, and navy --- [**[and
already conducting largely secret operations across much of the planet.
For all of this to happen]{.underline}**, **[there had to be an
enemy-industrial complex]{.underline}**]{.mark} as well, [**[a network
of crucial figures and institutions ready to pump up the threat we faced

liberty, and privacy were small things to sacrifice for American
safet]{.underline}**y]{.mark}. In short, any number of interests from
Bush administration figures eager to "sweep it all up" and do whatever
they wanted in the world to weapons makers, lobbyists, surveillance
outfits, think tanks, military intellectuals, assorted pundits... well,
the whole national and homeland security racket and its various
hangers-on had an interest in beefing up the enemy. For them, it was
important in the post-9/11 era that threats would never again lack a
capital "T" or a hefty dollar sign. And don't forget **[[a media that
was ready to pound the drums of war and emphasize what dangerous enemies
lurked in our world with remarkably few second
thoughts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Post-9/11**[, major media outlets were
generally prepared to take the enemy-industrial complex's word for it
and play every new terrorist incident as if it were potentially the end
of the world.]{.underline}** Increasingly as the years went on, jobs,
livelihoods, [**[an expanding world of "security" depended on the
continuance of all this]{.underline}**,]{.mark} depended, in short,
**[[on the injection of regular doses of fear into the body
politic.]{.mark}]{.underline}** That was the "favor" Osama bin Laden did
for Washington's national security apparatus and the Bush administration
on that fateful September morning. He engraved an argument in the
American brain that would live on indelibly for years, possibly decades,
calling for eternal vigilance at any cost and on a previously unknown
scale. As the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), that neocon
think-tank-cum-shadow-government, so fatefully put it in "Rebuilding
America's Defenses" a year before the 9/11 attacks: "Further, the
process of transformation \[of the military\], even if it brings
revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some
catastrophic and catalyzing event --- like a new Pearl Harbor." So when
the new Pearl Harbor arrived out of the blue, with many PNAC members
(from Vice President Dick Cheney on down) already in office, they
naturally saw their chance. They created an al-Qaeda on steroids and
launched their "global war" to establish a Pax Americana, in the Middle
East and then perhaps globally. They were aware that they lacked
opponents of the stature of those of the previous century and, in their
documents, they made it clear that they were planning to ensure no
future great-power-style enemy or bloc of enemy-like nations would
arise. Ever. For this, [**[they needed an American public anxious,
frightened, and ready to pay.]{.underline}** **[It
was]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** in other words, **[[in
their interest to manipulate us]{.mark}.]{.underline}** And if that were
all there were to it, our world would be a grim, but simple enough
place. As it happens, it's not. **[[Ruling elites]{.mark}, no matter
what power they have, don't work that way. Before they manipulate us,
they [almost invariably manipulate themselves.]{.mark}]{.underline}** I
was convinced of this years ago by a friend who had spent a lot of time
reading early Cold War documents from the National Security Council ---
from, that is, a small group of powerful governmental figures writing to
and for each other in the utmost secrecy. As he told me then and wrote
in Washington's China, the smart book he did on the early U.S. response
to the establishment of the People's Republic of China, what struck him
in the documents was the crudely anti-communist language those men used
in private with each other. It was the sort of anti-communism you might
otherwise have assumed Washington's ruling elite would only have wielded
to manipulate ordinary Americans with fears of Communist subversion, the
"enemy within," and Soviet plans to take over the world. (In fact, they
and others like them would use just such language to inject fear into
the body politic in those early Cold War years, that era of
McCarthyism.) They were indeed manipulative men, but before they
influenced other Americans they assumedly underwent something like a
process of collective auto-hypnotism in which they convinced one another
of the dangers they needed the American people to believe in. There is
evidence that a similar process took place in the aftermath of 9/11.
From the flustered look on George W. Bush's face as his plane took him
not toward but away from Washington on September 11, 2001, to the image
of Dick Cheney, in those early months, being chauffeured around
Washington in an armored motorcade with a "gas mask and a biochemical
survival suit" in the backseat, you could sense that the enemy loomed
large and omnipresent for them. They were, that is, genuinely scared,
even if they were also ready to make use of that fear for their own
ends. Or consider the issue of Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass
destruction, that excuse for the invasion of Iraq. Critics of the
invasion are generally quick to point out how that bogus issue was used
by the top officials of the Bush administration to gain public support
for a course that they had already chosen. After all, **[Cheney and his
men]{.underline}** cherry-picked the evidence to make their case, even
formed their own secret intel outfit to give them what they needed, and
ignored facts at hand that brought their version of events into
question. They publicly claimed in an orchestrated way that Saddam had
active nuclear and WMD programs. They **[spoke in the most open ways of
potential mushroom clouds from (nonexistent) Iraqi nuclear weapons
rising over American]{.underline}** cities, **[or of those same cities
being sprayed with (nonexistent) chemical or biological weapons from
(nonexistent) Iraqi drones.]{.underline}** They certainly had to know
that some of this information was useful but bogus. Still, **[they had
clearly also convinced themselves tha]{.underline}**t, on taking Iraq,
**[they would indeed find some Iraqi WMD to justify their
claims]{.underline}**. In his soon-to-be-published book, Dirty Wars,
Jeremy Scahill cites the conservative journalist Rowan Scarborough on
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's growing post-invasion irritation
over the search for Iraqi WMD sites. "Each morning," wrote Scarborough,
"the crisis action team had to report that another location was a bust.
Rumsfeld grew angrier and angrier. One officer quoted him as saying,
'They must be there!' At one briefing, he picked up the briefing slides
and tossed them back at the briefers." In other words**[, those top
officials hustling us into their global war and their long-desired
invasion of Iraq had also hustled themselves into the same world with a
similar set of fears]{.underline}**. This may seem odd, but given the
workings of the human mind, its ability to comfortably hold potentially
contradictory thoughts most of the time without disturbing itself
greatly, it's not. A similar phenomenon undoubtedly took place in the
larger national security establishment where self-interest combined
easily enough with fear. After all, in the post-9/11 era, they were
promising us one thing: something close to 100% "safety" when it came to
one small danger in our world --- terrorism. The fear that the next
underwear bomber might get through surely had the American public ---
but also the American security state --- in its grips. After all, who
loses the most if another shoe bomber strikes, another ambassador goes
down, another 9/11 actually happens? Whose job, whose world, will be at
stake then? **[They may indeed be a crew of Machiavellis]{.underline}**,
but **[[they are]{.mark} also [acolytes in the cult of terror and global
wa]{.mark}r. They live in the Cathedral of the Enemy. They were the
first believers and they will undoubtedly be the last ones as well.
[They are invested in the importance of the enemy. It's their religion.
They are]{.mark}]{.underline}**, after all[, **[the enemy-industrial
complex and if we are in their grip, so are they.]{.underline}**]{.mark}
The comic strip character Pogo once famously declared: "**[[We have met
the enemy and he is us."]{.mark}]{.underline}** How true. We just don't
know it yet.

JS)]{.underline}

This paper suggests this **[focus on war and violence has to be read
against rapidly shifting geographies and the recent general trend of
reduced violence in human affairs]{.underline}**. Whether this is the
promise of the liberal peace, a transitory imperial pax, something more
fundamental in human affairs, or a temporary historical blip remains to
be seen, **[but substantial [empirical analyses]{.mark} do [suggest that
violence is declining]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Human Security Report
2011**[). [This stands in stark contrast to realist assertions of war as
the human condition]{.mark} as well as to repeated warnings about the
supposed dangers to international order of rising Asian
powers]{.underline}**. Likewise [**the remilitarization of Anglo-Saxon
culture since 9/11 has suggested that warring is a routine part of
modern life**.]{.underline} But **[[the nature of war has
changed]{.mark} in some important ways [even if contemporary imperial
adventures]{.mark} in peripheral places [look all too familiar]{.mark}
to historians. [Peace]{.mark},]{.underline}** all this crucially
implies, **[is a matter of social processes, not a final
Telos,]{.underline}** a resolution of the tensions of human life, nor a
utopia that will arrive sometime. In Christian terms the aspirational
"Kingdom of God" is a work in progress. Nick Megoran (2011) in
particular has suggested [**that the geography discipline needs to think
much more carefully about peace making and the possibilities of
non-violence as modes of political action.**]{.underline} The key
question is focused on in the Megoran's pointed refusal to accept the
simplistic dismissal of the efficacy of non-violence given the obvious
prevalence of violence. The point of his argument is that
**[non-violence is a political strategy in part to respond to violence,
to initiate political actions in ways that are not hostage to the use of
force]{.underline}**. In doing so, especially in his discussion of
resistance to Nazi policies in Germany during the war, Megoran (2011)
underplays the important points about legitimacy as part of politics,
and likewise hints at the important contrast between non-violence as a
strategic mode of political action. Implied here is that while war may
be politics by other means, to gloss the classic Clausewitzian
formulation, non-violence is politics too. But politics plays in the
larger geopolitical context, and this must not be forgotten in
deliberations concerning the possible new initiatives geographers might
take in thinking carefully about disciplinary contributions to peace
research and practice. Contemporary social theory might point to Michel
Foucault, and the argument drawn from his writings that politics is the
extension of war rather than the other way round. Given the interest in
biopolitics and geogovernance within the discipline these matters are
obviously relevant but the connection to peace needs to be thought
carefully beyond formulations that simply assume it as the opposite of
wars (Morrissey 2011). This is especially the case given the changing
modes of contemporary warfare and the advocacy of violence as an
appropriate policy in present circumstances. [**The modes of warfare at
the heart of liberalism suggest that the [security of]{.mark} what Reid
and Dillon**]{.underline} (2009**[) call [the biohuman,]{.mark} the
liberal consuming subject, [involves a violent series of practices
designed to pacify the world by the elimination of political
alternatives]{.mark}. [The tension]{.mark} here [suggests]{.mark} an
imperial peace, [a forceful imposition of]{.mark} [a state of
non-war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In George W. Bush's terms justifying the
war on terror, a long struggle to eliminate tyranny (Dalby 2009a).
**[Peace is]{.underline}**, in this geopolitical understanding[**, what
comes after the elimination of opposition**.]{.underline} In late 2011
such formulations dominated discussions of the death of Colonel Gadaffi
in Libya. The dramatic transformation of human affairs in the last
couple of generations do require that would-be peaceful geographers look
both to the importance of non-violence and simultaneously to how global
transformations are changing the landscape of violence and social
change, all of it still under the threat of nuclear devastation should
major inter-state war occur once again. The re-emergence of non-violence
as an explicit political strategy, and in particular the use of Gene
Sharp's (1973) ideas of non-violent direct action in recent events pose
these questions very pointedly. Geographers have much to offer in such
re-thinking that may yet play their part in a more global understanding
of how interconnected our fates are becoming and how inappropriate
national state boundaries are as the premise for political action in a
rapidly changing biosphere. But to do so some hard thinking is needed on
geopolitics, and on how it works as well as how peace-full scholarship
might foster that which it desires. **[[Linking]{.mark} the practical
actions of [non-violence from Tahrir Square to]{.mark} those of the
[Occupy Wall Street]{.mark} actions,]{.underline}** underway as the
first draft of this paper was keyboarded, [**re[quires that we think
very carefully about the practices that now are designated]{.mark} in
terms of globalization.**]{.underline} Not all this is novel[**, but
[the geopolitical scene is shifting in ways that need to be incorporated
into the new thinking]{.mark} within geography [about war]{.mark},
peace, violence and what the discipline might have to say about, and
contribute to, non-violence as well as to contestations of contemporary
lawfare**]{.underline} (Gregory 2006[**). [Whether the delegitimization
of violence as a mode of rule will be extended]{.mark} further [in
coming decades]{.mark} [is one of the big questions facing peace
researchers]{.mark}. [The American reaction to 9/11 set things back
dramatically]{.mark},**]{.underline} an opportunity to respond in terms
of response to a crime and diplomacy was squandered, but [**[the]{.mark}
[wider social refusal to accept repression]{.mark} [and violence]{.mark}
as appropriate modes of rule** **[has]{.mark} interesting [potential to
constrain the use of military force]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
professionalization of many high technology militaries also reduces
their inclination to involve themselves in repressing social movements,
although here Mikhail Gorbachev's refusal to use the Red Army against
dissidents in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s remains emblematic of the
changes norms of acceptable rule that have been extended in the last few
generations. A geography discipline seriously interested in peace needs
to link the social processes on the relatively small scale such as the
non-violent protests Megoran (2011) highlights, and the peaceful
accompaniment actions that Koopman (2011) documents, to the larger
geopolitical transformations of our times, to make the eminently
geographical point that peace activities vary widely from place to
place, but now are an important part of larger contemporary geopolitical
transformations. GEOPOLITICS IN HISTORY **[Geopolitics has mostly been
about rivalries between great powers and their contestations of power on
the large scale]{.underline}**. These specifications of the political
world focus on states and the perpetuation of threats mapped as external
dangers to supposedly pacific polities. **[Much [geopolitical discourse
specifies the world as a dangerous place]{.mark}]{.underline}**, hence
[**precisely because of these mappings, one supposedly necessitating
violence in what passes for a realist interpretation of great powers as
the prime movers of history**]{.underline} (Mearsheimer 2001).
Geopolitical thinking is about order and order is in part a cartographic
notion. Juliet Fall (2010) once again emphasizes the importance of taken
for granted boundaries as the ontological given of contemporary
politics. Politics is about the cartographic control of territories, as
Megoran (2011) too ponders regarding the first half of the twentieth
century, but it also about much more than this**[, despite the
fascination that so many commentators have with the ideal form of the
supposedly national territorial state.]{.underline}** Part of what
geographers bring to the discussion of peace is a more nuanced
geographical imagination than that found in so much of international
studies (Dalby 2011a). On the other hand much **[of [the discussion of
peace sees war as the problem, peace as the
solution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Implied in that is geopolitics as the
problem**[, mapping dangers turns out to be a dangerous enterprise
insofar as it facilitates the perpetuation of violence by representing
other places as threats to which our place is
susceptible]{.underline}**. But [**this only matters if this is related
to the realist assumptions of the inevitability of
rivalry,**]{.underline} the eternal search for power as key to
humanity's self-organisation and the assumption that organized violence
is the ultimate arbiter (Dalby 2010). Critical geopolitics is about
challenging such contextualizations, and as such its relationships to
peace would seem to be obvious, albeit as Megoran (2011) notes mostly by
way of a focus on what Galtung (1969, 1971) calls negative peace.
[**Given the repeated reinvention of colonial tropes in contemporary
Western political discourse such critique remains an essential part of a
political geography that grants peoples "the courtesy of political
geography"**]{.underline} (Mitchell and Smith 1991). Undercutting the
moral logics of violence, so frequently relying on simplistic
invocations of geographical inevitability, to structure their
apologetics, remains a crucial contribution. Both the practical matters
of recent history and the scholarly contributions by geographers do not
allow simple binary distinctions of peace and war to be used as the
premise of either scholarship or political practice. [**[History and
scholarship]{.mark} suggest rather that [peace is what comes after war;
the relationship is temporal]{.mark},**]{.underline} stages in matters
of violence, geography and reorganizing facts on the ground.
Historically in the era of European warfare, coincident with the rise of
modernity, that [**many people hope is now near its end, peace was that
which was imposed by the victors, who in turn were the most powerful in
whatever contest was followed by a "peace"**.]{.underline} Much recent
geographical scholarship suggests that post conflict re-construction is
a mode of peace building literally (Kirsch and Flint 2011). But those of
us who would challenge war as a human institution, or think about
non-violence as a strategy for a better world, will not be satisfied
with a geography that is concerned only to pick up the pieces and
reconfigure them after they have been shattered by the latest round of
organized violence. The key points are that reconstruction is a violent
transformation of society, a world where frequently neo-liberal
globalization is seen as the imposition of social forms that will not
resist its logics. Hence peace is what victors impose, an imperial peace
that may eventually be quite welcome to those who benefit from the new
arrangements. Is peace then post-war? Perhaps it can be understood in
these terms. But **[the corollary is the equally important point that
peace is also frequently what comes before the next war]{.underline}**.
The normal human situation these days is a matter of non-war, but it is
far from clear where security is enforced that this is more than a
limited form of negative peace. [**[Without]{.mark} large-scale
[de-militarization]{.mark} then [peace is just what happens between
wars]{.mark}.**]{.underline} But given this then one additional key
point that geographers interested in war need to pay attention to is the
matter of how peace fails, how conflict escalates and how geography
matters in these processes (Flint et al 2009). Peacekeeping is
frequently about geographical separation as the Orwellian names for
contemporary walls in terms of lines of peace have it. But there is much
more geographical thinking to be done about these matters and the scales
of interactions across supposedly peaceful borders, not least where what
matters most is state security and its ordering principles rather than
local interactions across frontiers. This is so not least because of the
marked current trend to build fences around states as the supposed
solution to numerous security challenges (Jones 2011). Putting matters
into historical context also suggests that war is not what it used to
be, at least not after the events of the 1940s. Negative peace is about
preventing conflict; non-violence is about political strategies to
delegitimise violence, to challenge the human norms of behavior that
allow cultures of violence. It is important to link this to the issues
of what are now called lawfare (Morrissey 2011), the use of law as power
and coercion to set the rules of social and political life too. This has
been a key part of the US strategy for a long time; shaping institutions
to the benefit of the US economy as been what much of international
relations has been about, but the larger benefits of constraining
conflict are part of the larger process that international law struggles
to legitimize. Rules of conduct matter in the international system and
the wide-scale repudiation of the American invasion of Iraq in 2003
demonstrated this point clearly. [**The United Nations effectively made
war illegal although the number of ways round that formal restriction
has been considerable. War departments were renamed defence departments
the world over**,]{.underline} and policing, surveillance, spying as
well as military action became increasingly reconfigured in terms of
security. **[The United Nations executive committee however was named
the Security Council not the Peace Council, and [the rhetoric]{.mark}
ever since [has suggested that peace has to be conjoined with
security]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with the latter not the former
paramount. Apparently peace without security isn't worth bothering
about. It\'s peace and security. Which suggests that war is perhaps the
opposite of security as well as of peace. But perhaps security is to be
contrasted to violence instead? All of which requires careful conceptual
thinking about the current geopolitical borders. Crucial, but unremarked
upon by many political geographers, is the simple fact that there is now
widespread agreement that borders between states are fixed finally
(Zacher 2001). Demarcation disputes, and no doubt some very interesting
arguments about changing coastal boundaries as sea levels rise in coming
decades will continue, but the territorial fixity assumption has changed
one fundamental facet of warfare between states. Given the importance of
territorial disputes historically as a cause of wars this point is
important. So too is the finding that it matters greatly how these
disputes are handled. Treated as "realist" matters of power politics
territorial matters are more likely to lead to war than if diplomacy and
conflict resolution are taken seriously (Vasquez and Henehan 2011). The
exceptions here do seem to prove the rule: **[Palestine and Kashmir are
two flashpoints where attempts to move borders]{.underline}**, or at
least the refusal to accept their imposition, [**are key to continued
violence**.]{.underline} Fixing geographical borders removes one major
historical cause of interstate warfare. Territorial aggrandizement is
now mostly a thing of the past, as the reconstruction of Bosnia and the
refusal to change antecedent boundaries illustrates, albeit very
painfully. The title of Gearoid O'Tuathail and Carl Dahlman's (2011)
book is Bosnia Remade, not Bosnia Removed, and that matters in terms of
how politics is now literally mapped. This norm matters greatly and the
importance of agreement on frontiers and their delimitation tragically
continues in the southern areas of what until recently was the singular
state of Sudan in particular. CONTEMPORARY GEOPOLITICAL CHANGES While
there is optimism over the territorial covenant on both the small scale
and the very large scale the fixity of boundaries has not prevented
either the violence of what Mary Kaldor (2006) called the new wars after
the cold war, nor imperial adventures by the United States, the United
Kingdom, Canada and other metropolitan states. Indeed looking at the
macro-scale patterns of imperial power the question is whether current
Middle East warring is but the latest phase of "Anglosphere" imperial
violence (Megoran 2009). Robert Fisk\'s (2006) subtitle to his huge book
on the region is blunt in posing the matter as the conquest of the
Middle East. Understanding the United States and the United Kingdom,
with various settler colonies as extensions of an Anglosphere suggests
only that [**[the patterns of conquest, and indirect but violent rule
have shifted]{.mark}**]{.underline} to another region of the planet,
from North America in the eighteenth century to South Asia and then
Africa in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, finally now the
pattern is extended to the Middle East in the latter part of the
twentieth and early twenty-first century. This shifting pattern of
Anglosphere violence is the updated logic of Kevin Phillips (1997)
argument about the Cousin\'s Wars as key to the rise of British and
subsequently American power. Thus focusing on the specific geographies
of the war on terror is a useful antidote to the hugely exaggerated
claims of Islamic threats as a global phenomenon invoking the need for
an American lead world war (Podhoretz 2007). But elsewhere violence has
followed resources, at least to the sources of valuable ones and oil in
particular (Le Billon and Cervantes 2009). Mary Kaldor's (2006) analysis
of the new wars suggests both that globalization matters in terms of the
patterns of connection that fuel and fund violence, and also in that the
role of [**[political violence is often about control of population and
economic assets rather than a matter of territorial
control]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Militias and gangs, as well as would be
micro-nationalists are not the warring entities of nation states in
violent competition invading each other's territories; they are more
diffuse arrangements, something more analogous to medieval geographies
rather than the violent interactions of discrete clearly demarcated
modern states. This is not unrelated to the imposition of the
cartography of the territorial covenant, even if it has generated whole
new categories of geopolitics, of ungoverned areas and regional
peripheral regions where violence persists, and drones, interventions
and mercenaries are commonplace. Over the last few decades the potential
for major power warfare seems to have lessened, whatever about great
power interventions in peripheral places[. **[The global economy
has,]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of late[, required much greater
cooperation between political elites]{.mark}. [The looming crises of
climate change that make unilateral action less efficacious, suggest the
possibilities of less confrontational assumptions as the premise in
geopolitics.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While resource wars get
headlines[**, much of environmental politics is about cooperation and
treaty-making rather than warfare**]{.underline} (Dinar 2011). Much of
the contemporary violence that grabs the attention of headline writers
is matters of conflict, competition and rivalry but it is not the
classical war Clausewitz pointed to as the contest between two
autonomous combatants in a struggle of wills fought until one forces the
other to concede. Much of this might fit into his categories of small
wars, but that in itself is significant if **[[it supports the
contention that great powers have given up the use of major war]{.mark},
if not police actions, [as policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### 2NC Hegemony---Epistemology Indict/ AT Empirics

#### Relative propensity for conflict is much higher in a unipolar system

[How well, then, **does the argument that unipolar systems are peaceful
account for the first two decades of unipolarity since the end of the
Cold War?** Table 1 presents a list of great powers divided into three
periods: 1816 to 1945, multipolarity; 1946 to 1989, bipolarity; and
since 1990, unipolarity.46 Table 2 presents summary data about the
incidence of war during each of these periods. [Unipolarity is the most
conflict prone]{.mark} of all the systems**, according to at least two
important criteria: the percentage of years that great powers spend at
war and the incidence of war involving great powers**. **[In
multipolarity, 18 percent of great power years were spent at
war]{.mark}. [In bipolarity, the ratio is 16 percent]{.mark}. [In
unipolarity]{.mark}, however, [a]{.mark} remarkable [59 percent of great
power years until now were spent at war]{.mark}. This is by far the
highest percentage in all three systems**. Furthermore, **[during
periods of multipolarity and bipolarity, the probability that war
involving a great power would break out]{.mark} in any given year
[was]{.mark}**, respectively, **[4.2 percent and 3.4 percent]{.mark}**.
**[Under unipolarity, it is 18.2 percent]{.mark}**---or more than four
times higher.47 **These figures provide no evidence that unipolarity is
peaceful.**48 In sum, **the argument that unipolarity makes for peace is
heavily weighted toward interactions among the most powerful states in
the system**. This should come as no surprise given thatWohlforth makes
a structural argument: peace flows from the unipolar structure of
international politics, not from any particular characteristic of the
unipole.49 Structural analyses of the international system are usually
centered on interactions between great powers.50 As Waltz writes, "The
theory, like the story, of international politics is written in terms of
the great powers of an era."51 In the sections that follow, however, I
show that in the case of unipolarity, an investigation of its
peacefulness must consider potential causes of conºict beyond
interactions between the most important states in the
system.]{.underline}

When the war ended eight horrendous years later, mainstream opinion was

the critics, to whom it was "a mistake" that proved too costly. By 1977,
President Carter aroused little notice when he explained that we owe
Vietnam "no debt" because "the destruction was mutual." **[There are

When the single question received the wrong answer, government rhetoric

American Decline With such lessons in mind, **[[it is useful to look at
what is highlighted in the major journals of policy and opinion
today]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Let us keep to the most prestigious of the
establishment journals, **[Foreign Affairs.]{.underline}** The headline
blaring on the cover of the December 2011 issue reads in bold face: "Is
America Over?" The **[title article calls for "retrenchment" in the
"humanitarian missions" abroad that are consuming the country's wealth,
so as to arrest the American decline that is a major theme of
international affairs discourse, usually accompanied by the corollary
that power is shifting to the East, to China and]{.underline}** (maybe)
**[India.]{.underline}** The lead articles are on Israel-Palestine. The
first, by two high Israeli officials, is entitled "The Problem is
Palestinian Rejection": the conflict cannot be resolved because
Palestinians refuse to recognize Israel as a Jewish state --- thereby
conforming to standard diplomatic practice: states are recognized, but
not privileged sectors within them. The demand is hardly more than a new
device to deter the threat of political settlement that would undermine
Israel's expansionist goals. The opposing position, defended by an
American professor, is entitled "The Problem Is the Occupation." The
subtitle reads "How the Occupation is Destroying the Nation." Which
nation? Israel, of course. The paired articles appear under the heading
"Israel under Siege." **[The January 2012 issue features yet another
call to bomb Iran now, before it is too late]{.underline}**. Warning of
"the dangers of deterrence," the author suggests that "skeptics of
military action fail to appreciate the true danger that a nuclear-armed
Iran would pose to U.S. interests in the Middle East and beyond. And
their grim forecasts assume that the cure would be worse than the
disease --- that is, that the consequences of a U.S. assault on Iran
would be as bad as or worse than those of Iran achieving its nuclear
ambitions. But that is a faulty assumption. The truth is that a military
strike intended to destroy Iran's nuclear program, if managed carefully,
could spare the region and the world a very real threat and dramatically
improve the long-term national security of the United States." Others
argue that the costs would be too high, and at the extremes some even
point out that an attack would violate international law --- as does the
stand of the moderates, who regularly deliver threats of violence, in
violation of the U.N. Charter. Let us review these dominant concerns in
turn. **[[American decline is real, though the apocalyptic vision
reflects the familiar ruling class perception that anything short of
total control amounts to total disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[Despite the piteous laments, [the U.S. remains the world dominant
power by a large margin, and no competitor is in
sight]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} not only in the military
dimension, in which of course the U.S. reigns supreme. China and India
have recorded rapid (though highly inegalitarian) growth, but remain
very poor countries, with enormous internal problems not faced by the
West. China is the world's major manufacturing center, but largely as an
assembly plant for the advanced industrial powers on its periphery and
for western multinationals. That is likely to change over time.
Manufacturing regularly provides the basis for innovation, often
breakthroughs, as is now sometimes happening in China. One example that
has impressed western specialists is China's takeover of the growing
global solar panel market, not on the basis of cheap labor but by
coordinated planning and, increasingly, innovation. But the problems
China faces are serious. Some are demographic, reviewed in Science, the
leading U.S. science weekly. The study shows that mortality sharply
decreased in China during the Maoist years, "mainly a result of economic
development and improvements in education and health services,
especially the public hygiene movement that resulted in a sharp drop in
mortality from infectious diseases." This progress ended with the
initiation of the capitalist reforms 30 years ago, and the death rate
has since increased. Furthermore, China's recent economic growth has
relied substantially on a "demographic bonus," a very large working-age
population. "But the window for harvesting this bonus may close soon,"
with a "profound impact on development": "Excess cheap labor supply,
which is one of the major factors driving China's economic miracle, will
no longer be available." Demography is only one of many serious problems
ahead. For India, the problems are far more severe. Not all prominent
voices foresee American decline. Among international media, there is
none more serious and responsible than the London Financial Times. It
recently devoted a full page to the optimistic expectation that new
technology for extracting North American fossil fuels might allow the
U.S. to become energy independent, hence to retain its global hegemony
for a century. There is no mention of the kind of world the U.S. would
rule in this happy event, but not for lack of evidence. At about the
same time, the International Energy Agency reported that, with rapidly
increasing carbon emissions from fossil fuel use, the limit of safety
will be reached by 2017 if the world continues on its present course.
"The door is closing," the IEA chief economist said, and very soon it
"will be closed forever." Shortly before the U.S. Department of Energy
reported the most recent carbon dioxide emissions figures, which "jumped
by the biggest amount on record" to a level higher than the worst-case
scenario anticipated by the International Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). That came as no surprise to many scientists, including the MIT
program on climate change, which for years has warned that the IPCC
predictions are too conservative. Such critics of the IPCC predictions
receive virtually no public attention, unlike the fringe of denialists
who are supported by the corporate sector, along with huge propaganda
campaigns that have driven Americans off the international spectrum in
dismissal of the threats. Business support also translates directly to
political power. Denialism is part of the catechism that must be intoned
by Republican candidates in the farcical election campaign now in
progress, and in Congress they are powerful enough to abort even efforts
to inquire into the effects of global warming, let alone do anything
serious about it. In brief, **[[American decline can]{.mark} perhaps [be
stemmed if we abandon hope for decent survival]{.mark}, prospects that
are all too real given the balance of forces in the
world.]{.underline}** "Losing" China and Vietnam Putting such unpleasant
thoughts aside, a close look at American decline shows that China indeed
plays a large role, as it has for 60 years. The decline that now elicits
such concern is not a recent phenomenon. It traces back to the end of
World War II, when the U.S. had half the world's wealth and incomparable
security and global reach. Planners were naturally well aware of the
enormous disparity of power, and intended to keep it that way. The basic
viewpoint was outlined with admirable frankness in a major state paper
of 1948 (PPS 23). The author was one of the architects of the New World
Order of the day, the chair of the State Department Policy Planning
Staff, the respected statesman and scholar George Kennan, a moderate
dove within the planning spectrum. He observed that the central policy
goal was to maintain the "position of disparity" that separated our
enormous wealth from the poverty of others. To achieve that goal, he
advised, "We should cease to talk about vague and... unreal objectives
such as human rights, the raising of the living standards, and
democratization," and must "deal in straight power concepts," not
"hampered by idealistic slogans" about "altruism and world-benefaction."
Kennan was referring specifically to Asia, but the observations
generalize, with exceptions, for participants in the U.S.-run global
system. It was well understood that the "idealistic slogans" were to be
displayed prominently when addressing others, including the intellectual
classes, who were expected to promulgate them. The plans that Kennan
helped formulate and implement took for granted that the U.S. would
control the Western Hemisphere, the Far East, the former British empire
(including the incomparable energy resources of the Middle East), and as
much of Eurasia as possible, crucially its commercial and industrial
centers. These were not unrealistic objectives, given the distribution
of power. But decline set in at once. In 1949, China declared
independence, an event known in Western discourse as "the loss of China"
--- in the U.S., with bitter recriminations and conflict over who was
responsible for that loss. The terminology is revealing. It is only
possible to lose something that one owns. The tacit assumption was that
the U.S. owned China, by right, along with most of the rest of the
world, much as postwar planners assumed. The "loss of China" was the
first major step in "America's decline." It had major policy
consequences. One was the immediate decision to support France's effort
to reconquer its former colony of Indochina, so that it, too, would not
be "lost." Indochina itself was not a major concern, despite claims
about its rich resources by President Eisenhower and others. Rather, the
concern was the "domino theory," which is often ridiculed when dominoes
don't fall, but remains a leading principle of policy because it is
quite rational. To adopt Henry Kissinger's version, a region that falls
out of control can become a "virus" that will "spread contagion,"
inducing others to follow the same path. In the case of Vietnam, the
concern was that the virus of independent development might infect
Indonesia, which really does have rich resources. And that might lead
Japan --- the "superdomino" as it was called by the prominent Asia
historian John Dower --- to "accommodate" to an independent Asia as its
technological and industrial center in a system that would escape the
reach of U.S. power. That would mean, in effect, that the U.S. had lost
the Pacific phase of World War II, fought to prevent Japan's attempt to
establish such a New Order in Asia. The way to deal with such a problem
is clear: destroy the virus and "inoculate" those who might be infected.
In the Vietnam case, the rational choice was to destroy any hope of
successful independent development and to impose brutal dictatorships in
the surrounding regions. Those tasks were successfully carried out ---
though history has its own cunning, and something similar to what was
feared has since been developing in East Asia, much to Washington's
dismay. The most important victory of the Indochina wars was in 1965,
when a U.S.-backed military coup in Indonesia led by General Suharto
carried out massive crimes that were compared by the CIA to those of
Hitler, Stalin and Mao. The "staggering mass slaughter," as the New York
Times described it, was reported accurately across the mainstream, and
with unrestrained euphoria. It was "a gleam of light in Asia," as the
noted liberal commentator James Reston wrote in the Times. The coup
ended the threat of democracy by demolishing the mass-based political
party of the poor, established a dictatorship that went on to compile
one of the worst human rights records in the world, and threw the riches
of the country open to western investors. Small wonder that, after many
other horrors, including the near-genocidal invasion of East Timor,
Suharto was welcomed by the Clinton administration in 1995 as "our kind
of guy." Years after the great events of 1965, Kennedy-Johnson National
Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy reflected that it would have been wise
to end the Vietnam war at that time, with the "virus" virtually
destroyed and the primary domino solidly in place, buttressed by other
U.S.-backed dictatorships throughout the region. Similar procedures have
been routinely followed elsewhere. Kissinger was referring specifically
to the threat of socialist democracy in Chile. That threat was ended on
another forgotten date, what Latin Americans call "the first 9/11,"
which in violence and bitter effects far exceeded the 9/11 commemorated
in the West. A vicious dictatorship was imposed in Chile, one part of a
plague of brutal repression that spread through Latin America, reaching
Central America under Reagan. Viruses have aroused deep concern
elsewhere as well, including the Middle East, where the threat of
secular nationalism has often concerned British and U.S. planners,
inducing them to support radical Islamic fundamentalism to counter it.
The Concentration of Wealth and American Decline Despite such victories,
American decline continued. By 1970, U.S. share of world wealth had
dropped to about 25 percent, roughly where it remains, still colossal
but far below the end of World War II. By then, the industrial world was
"tripolar": US-based North America, German-based Europe and East Asia,
already the most dynamic industrial region, at the time Japan-based, but
by now including the former Japanese colonies Taiwan and South Korea,
and more recently China. At about that time, **[[American decline

declin]{.mark}e]{.underline}**. From the 1970s, **[[there has been a
significant change in the U.S. economy, as planners,]{.mark} private and
state, [shifted it toward financialization and the offshoring of

to the level of farce, the Democrats (now largely the former "moderate
Republicans") not far behind.

## Soft Power

studies at Oklahoma State University, "Real War News, Real War Games:
The Hekmati Case and the Problems of Soft Power," American Quarterly

**[When]{.underline}** Barack **[Obama was elected]{.underline}** to the
presidency in 2008, he **[promised to implement a "smarter" foreign
policy strategy that balanced the use of hard and soft power assets on a
situational basis]{.underline}**. As if to affirm the demotion of hard
power, he jettisoned the name "Global War on Terror" and adopted
"Overseas Contingency Operation."1 To speak of "visual culture and the
war on terrorism," then, is something of an anachronism. Yet, arguably,
visual media play an even more important role now that soft power has
been embraced as a complement to war. And, make no mistake, **[[Obama's
"smart power" strategy is not a campaign to end war or replace it with
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As former CIA chief Michael Hayden
recently declared, **[Obama's [foreign policy is the same as Bush's,
"but with more killing]{.mark}.]{.underline}**"2 Like its forerunners[,
**[the]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[Obama [administration seeks to
perpetuate American power and influence; it is just willing to do so by
any means necessary.]{.mark} [Thus smart power is less a departure from
hard power than an extension of it into new
realms]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The case of Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, a US
citizen recently arrested in Iran, convicted of spying for the CIA, and
condemned to death, all for his association with the online gaming
company Kuma Games, provides some insight into the shifting terrain of
geopolitics in the information age. Specifically, it illustrates a
change in the conceptions of hard and soft power, such that the two have
become virtually indistinguishable. This change both derives from and
perpetuates a broader move toward the militarization of the social
field, which has important consequences for our capacity to imagine a
condition of peace. Popular media have certainly played a role in this
process by glorifying military institutions and exploits and celebrating
soldier-subjects and their behaviors. As I argued in Terrorism TV,
films, video games, and television shows have helped position militarism
at the center of public policy and social life in the United States, and
this process has been going on for decades.3 Kuma Games, which makes the
online gaming series Kuma/War, figured prominently in that discussion.
Following Roger Stahl, I argued that such games work like \[End Page
177\] advertisements for the military lifestyle, interpellating players
into a military mind-set and turning them into "virtual
citizen-soldiers," ready to accept the legitimacy of hard power and
willing to apply it to virtually any social problem. What I failed to
ask at the time was **[how militarization might affect other
populations: as a tool of soft power, how might such games help shape
the field of geopolitical engagement? How might the militarization of
social life, pursued in and through US popular culture, influence others
in the global mediascape?]{.underline}** The Hekmati case brings such
questions to the fore and begs us to think more deeply about the nature
of soft power in the contemporary context. Hekmati's arrest should be
situated in relation to two recent and troubling trends in US foreign
policy. The first is the militarization of public diplomacy under the
aegis of the war on terror. As State Department budgets have atrophied,
military budgets have exploded, leaving the military as the only
government entity with the operational capacity to engage foreign
populations on behalf of the state. But military information operations
tend to be short-term and highly instrumental, targeting populations to
achieve a strategic advantage. **[[Militarized public diplomacy treats
information as a weapon and]{.underline}]{.mark}**, thus, **[[makes
cross-cultural dialogue hard to sustain]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
second trend multiplies and extends the first, for the privatization of
militarism enables all sorts of independent actors to carry the banner
for the US Armed Forces. Video games are an important example of this
trend, for the most popular games are still the military-themed
first-person shooters, which reduce geopolitics to a conflict structure
and invite players to duke it out for supremacy**[. [Diplomacy and
compromise are not even options]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Together these
trends raise the following questions: What **[happens [when soft power
resources are used like weapons, "to create, strengthen, or preserve
conditions favorable for the advancement of]{.mark}]{.underline}** USG
\[**[[US government\] interests, policies, and
objectives]{.mark}?"]{.underline}**4 **[Will the United States be able
to wield influence if its communications and diplomacy operations look
and feel like psychological operations?]{.underline}** **[And what will
happen to international relations if hard power logics are placed at the
center of cross-cultural exchange?]{.underline}** If the military story
becomes the only story US culture is interested in telling or selling,
where does that leave non-Americans? The case of Amir Hekmati embodies
this collapse of public and private, hard and soft power assets and thus
can illuminate the likely outcome of the United States' decision to
privilege power over communication and exchange in the information age.
Netwar on Iran Iran has been an early testing ground for the use of soft
power to achieve instrumental, hard power goals. Since the 1979
revolution, the United States \[End Page 178\] has not had formal
diplomatic relations with the Iranian regime. As a result, contacts have
been irregular and informal, and all of them "have been used, either
overtly or covertly, to promote regime change."5 In 2006 the Bush
administration established an Office of Iranian Affairs inside the State
Department to coordinate its "transformational diplomacy" operations.
The office received \$66 million from Congress to "promote freedom and
human rights in Iran." Some of that money was used to establish
Persian-language radio and TV operations under the Voice of America
banner; the rest went "to support the efforts of civil-society groups"
and dissidents operating inside Iran to promote democracy and effect
regime change.6 Such overt attempts at public diplomacy were
supplemented by an expansion of covert military and intelligence
operations in the country. In 2007 President George W. Bush signed a
presidential finding authorizing an increase in reconnaissance
expeditions to "\[gather\] information \[and\] \[enlist\] support" for
regime change efforts in the country. Congress provided \$400 million to
support these efforts, much of which went to fund attacks on Iranian
security forces by extremist groups like Jundullah (a group the US State
Department has labeled a terrorist organization).7 US Special Forces in
Iraq, meanwhile, stepped up cross-border raids into Iran with the aim of
kidnapping or killing high-ranking members of the Iranian Revolutionary
Guard.8 The Obama administration came to power promising to reestablish
formal diplomatic ties with Iran, but was forced by circumstances to
embrace an equally informal combination of public diplomacy and covert
military adventurism. Obama did eliminate the so-called Democracy Fund
and has toned down the "regime change" rhetoric, but US funding for both
overt and covert operations in the region has actually increased under
his watch.9 He has authorized a "broad expansion of clandestine military
activity" in the Middle East, including operations to gather
"reconnaissance that could pave the way for possible military strikes .
. . if tensions over \[Iran's\] nuclear ambitions escalate."10 In 2011
he helped the Israelis unleash a computer virus that wiped out up to
one-fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges, and he has authorized the
target killing of Iranian nuclear scientists.11 Is it any wonder, then,
that Iran has replied to these provocations with its own militarized
campaign to counter and contain US influence in the region? When the
United States began funneling money to prodemocracy groups inside Iran,
the Ahmadinejad regime responded with a coordinated propaganda campaign
to tar all such groups as CIA stooges.12 It instituted a crackdown on
activists, teachers, intellectuals, women's rights groups, and labor
leaders, accusing them of receiving support from the United States and
thus of committing treason. When the US Congress responded by
appropriating \[End Page 179\] \$30 million to document and publicize
human rights abuses inside Iran, the Iranian authorities countered with
their own \$20 million program to expose human rights violations in the
United States.13 Since then, Iran has banned or blocked access to cable,
Internet, and cell phone transmissions during periods of strife and,
under the guise of the "Iranian Cyber Army," redirected Twitter and
Facebook traffic to websites carrying anti-American slogans. The Iranian
authorities have imposed stringent Internet filters and firewalls to
preempt political speech in cyberspace and launched their own
cyberattacks on sensitive computer systems in Israel and the United
States. The Hekmati case must be placed squarely within this context of
low-intensity conflict, or netwar. According to John Arquilla and David
Ronfeldt, netwar is "a comprehensive information-oriented approach to
social conflict," which extends the field of battle into civil society
and blurs once-distinct boundaries between offense and defense, soldiers
and civilians, combat operations and diplomatic endeavors.14 The concept
is designed to account for the entry of nonstate actors into the fields
of war and diplomacy and to describe how information works as a weapon
within this extensive field of combat. On the one hand, information
technologies can be used to create deep coalitions predicated on shared
values or interests. Al-Qaeda's use of the Internet to recruit soldiers
and financial supporters is a model for this aspect of netwar. On the
other hand, information can also be used as a weapon to confuse the
enemy and preemptively deprive it of support. Tiziana Terranova has
argued that the US response to the 1979 Iranian revolution was an early
example of this strategy. US media outlets portrayed the revolutionaries
as irrational zealots and the US hostages as sympathetic civilians in
need of rescue. The resulting images bombarded viewers' senses,
provoking affective responses (revulsion, pity, anger) that
short-circuited any attempt at rational argument or political dialogue.
By "focus\[ing\] all public attention on building up a wave of
resentment against the Iranians," the State Department ensured the
United States would assume the moral high ground.15 It was a technique
for producing, rather than speaking to, a public. Thus it was not
propaganda but information warfare. The truth or falsity of the
representations mattered less than their capacity to mobilize a pro-US
public. Arguably, this is the role that **[[public
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** serves in the contemporary era. It
**[is no longer about communicating values, exchanging information, or
enlightening foreign publics; it [is about "stirring people up" and
controlling the battle space.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The Iranian
authorities seem to understand this quite well, which is why they have
made popular culture into a prominent battleground in their
low-intensity conflict with the United States. Viewing US entertainment
\[End Page 180\] media as Trojan horses, they have banned American
music, censored Hollywood films, prohibited the use of satellite dishes,
shut down Facebook, and, most recently, pulled Barbie from store shelves
for promoting "destructive" cultural and social habits. In one sense,
Hekmati's arrest is just an extension of such cultural warfare. In
another sense, however, it is a deepening of that conflict, for it
acknowledges the role of privatized commercial culture in the
militarization of the social field. Like the state, Kuma/War and other
such militarized video games frame politics in warlike terms. They
produce a conflict structure that attracts others and ends up trapping
the United States in its own nets/netwars. Militarized Gaming as
Information Warfare In a videotaped "confession" aired on Iranian state
TV, Hekmati admitted to receiving military intelligence training and
working for Kuma Games, which he portrayed as a CIA front operation. The
real aim of Kuma Games is not to entertain, he said, but "to convince
the people of the world and Iraq that what the US does in Iraq and other
countries is good and acceptable."16 Among other things, Hekmati worked
on game modules for the online series Kuma/ War, which the website
describes as "an interactive chronicle of the War on Terror."17 Each
ten- to fifteen-minute "episode" allowed subscribers to replay military
engagements from the recent past, using logistical material supplied by
a team of military advisers. Popular episodes included "Operation
Anaconda," "Fallujah: Operation Al Fajr," and "The Death of Osama Bin
Laden." Three episodes have focused on Iran and likely raised the
hackles of Hekmati's captors: a two-part series called "Iran Hostage
Rescue Mission," focused on "Operation Eagle Claw," the aborted Delta
Force mission to rescue US hostages held in the US Embassy in Tehran
during the 1979 revolution, and the speculative fiction "Assault on
Iran," which is described as "the most plausible scenario \[for\]
delaying or destroying Iran's nuclear arms capabilities." More so than
other episodes, these give a good sense of what Kuma/War is really
about: chronicling US conflict so that players can invent or remake
history as it suits them. Like other military-themed video games,
Kuma/War places players in the shoes of the US military and asks them
work through logistical information to achieve a mission. To enhance the
realism, each episode is framed by a range of documentary intertexts,
from faux news reports to logistical data, satellite imagery, and
interviews with military experts and actual participants in the events.
For example, the "Iran Hostage Rescue Mission" modules are framed by
interviews with "the CIA's former 'Master of Disguise,' Antonio Mendez"
(he of the caper at the heart of the new film Argo). The series' motto
is "Real War \[End Page 181\] News. Real War Games," but the ads for the
site invite players to "re-create the news" and "remake history."18 And,
as the Iran modules demonstrate, there is plenty of room to make history
up as you go. "Iran Hostage Rescue Mission," for example, is predicated
on the understanding that you will succeed where US Delta Forces
originally failed, and "Assault on Iran" invites players to live history
before it happens. Likewise, Jennifer Terry reports that Kuma/War's
gamed version of the 2004 Marine assault on Fallujah ("Fallujah:
Operation Al Fajr") transforms US soldiers into protectors of Iraqi
civilians trapped inside the battle zone. Though in reality it was the
US military cordon that trapped the civilians in the first place and the
US soldiers who constituted the gravest threat to their survival, in
Kuma's version, you get to be the defender, not the aggressor.18 As
these examples illustrate, there is nothing subtle about Kuma/War's
biases. If it really was a CIA propaganda operation, one wonders why
Kuma Games would bother making it seem like a private corporation.20
More likely, Iran's attempt to draw attention to the games is not about
the content or ownership but about the way video games, in general, have
come to direct and modulate global attention. Games like Army of Two,
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and the Battlefield series all share an
orientalist imaginary, which identifies Arabs and Muslims as enemies of
the United States and constructs US heroism through their extermination.
As propaganda, they are fairly ham-fisted, but as weapons in an
information war over how to frame contemporary conflicts, they
effectively mobilize enmity against Middle Eastern populations and
produce publics willing to support US militarism as a solution to the
problem. The Iranian authorities know full well that games like these
are not state propaganda. However, they are also unwilling to let them
stand unchallenged as a historical framework. By identifying Kuma Games
as a CIA front operation, I think they mean to reframe the US story
about its endeavors in the Middle East, thereby depriving the United
States of "its attractiveness and legitimacy" in the eyes of others. In
other words, the Hekmati arrest is an information operation designed to
"\[create\] a disabling environment" for the delivery of US messaging.21
Iran and its allies are also taking their case against such games to the
players themselves. In response to Kuma/War's "Assault on Iran," for
example, the Association of Islamic Unions of Students in Iran designed
its own game called Special Operation 85: Hostage Rescue. It is a
first-person shooter game in which players work to free two Iranian
nuclear scientists kidnapped by the United States. The Central
Intelligence Bureau of Hezbollah has also created two first-person
shooters (Special Force 1 and 2) that allow players to replay key
battles from the conflicts between Lebanon and Israel in the 1980s and
\[End Page 182\] 2006. Here, the Israelis are the enemy, and Hezbollah
are the heroic underdogs from whose perspective the battles are
fought.22 Kuma CEO Keith Halper describes these game design wars as a
new form of political debate. "We have made a point," he says, "they
have responded."23 Yet both Eastern and Western war-themed games tend to
use a "shoot-and-destroy mechanic" that promotes a faith in militarism
as the solution to all sorts of social problems. As a message about
geopolitics, these games privilege a conflict-structure that is
appealing in its simplicity and satisfying in its emotional charge. They
are the video game equivalents of President Bush's framing of the US
response to 9/11 as a "war" on terror. Such phrasing may have been
designed to empower and reassure distraught Americans, but the
administration failed to take into the account the problem of multiple
audiences. Al-Qaeda was attracted by this framing. It, too, prefers to
see the world in warlike terms and has been more than happy to adopt the
slogan for its own recruiting efforts. Indeed, a case can be made that
the war frame helped Al-Qaeda more than it inspired the United States
and its allies. Certainly it has fueled resentment against the United
States and fostered a generation of angry young men who see guns and

Members of the Bush Administration are fond of drawing analogies between
the America of the early cold war and the America of the present,
especially to emphasize the material preponderance of the United States
at both historical moments and to underline the special responsibility
that the nation bore and continues to bear in the execution of its
power.65 Yet, [**even as the [U.S. government promotes the assumption
that "public diplomacy helped win the cold war, and it has the potential
to win the war on terror,"]{.mark} it has established a framework for
the waging of the contemporary battle that is very different from that
promoted fifty years ago**.]{.underline}66 In both instances, **[a "war
of ideas" is evoked to frame a bipolar clash of civilizations and
promote a national ideal of liberal democracy, yet [the combination of
value and security in each instance is shaped by]{.mark} different
geostrategic frameworks of "[national security]{.mark}." During the cold
war the (publicly stated) regulatory paradigm was that of "containment,"
which functioned to segment publics and information; in the war on
terror the leading paradigm is "integration," which seeks to draw
publics into an American designed "zone of peace."]{.underline}** The
National Strategy for Combating Terrorism states that "ridding the world
of terrorism is essential to a broader purpose. We strive to build an
international order where more countries and peoples are integrated into
a world consistent with the interests and values we share with our
partners."67 Both paradigms, however, conceal strategic tensions. **[For
many inside and outside U.S. administrations in the 1950s, containment
pointed toward coexistence with the Soviet bloc and its captive peoples,
precluding the extension of freedom through "liberation." For many
inside and outside the current administration, "[integration" does not
provide a solution for long-term war with rogue states and
tyrants]{.mark}, a war that has to be waged by and for a U.S.
"preponderance of power." It is our contention that political warfare
tries to bridge, if not resolve, these tensions.]{.underline}** In 1950,
NSC 68 concluded with the mandate not only to "strengthen the
orientation toward the United States of the non-Soviet nations" but also
"to encourage and promote the gradual retraction of undue Russian power
and influence from the present perimeter areas around traditional
Russian boundaries and the emergence of the satellite countries as
entities independent of the USSR."68 A half-century later Richard
**[Haass,]{.underline}** Director of Policy Planning in the State
Department (and far from an acolyte of the "neoconservative" movement),
**[easily moved from describing the goal of post-- cold war U.S. foreign
policy as "a process of integration in which the United States works
with others to promote ends that benefit everyone" to acknowledging [it

#### Violence is a social construction---The epistemology of inevitability and rationality create a self-fulfilling prophecy

I was motivated to begin the larger project from which this essay
derives by a number of concerns. I felt [that the available critical,
interpretive or performative languages of war]{.underline} \-- realist
and liberal international relations theories, just war theories, and
various Clausewitzian derivations of strategy \-- [failed us, because
they either perform or refuse to place under suspicion the underlying
political ontologies]{.underline} that I have sought to unmask and
question here. [Many [realists have]{.mark} quite [nuanced]{.mark} and
critical [attitudes]{.mark} to the use of force, [but ultimately affirm
strategic thought]{.mark}]{.underline} and remain embedded within the
existential framework of the nation-state. Both liberal internationalist
and just war doctrines seek mainly to improve the accountability of
decision-making in security affairs and to limit some of the worst moral
enormities of war, but (apart from the more radical versions of
cosmopolitanism) they fail to question the ontological claims of
political community or strategic theory. In the case of a theorist like
Jean Bethke Elshtain, just war doctrine is in fact allied to a softer,
liberalised form of the Hegelian-Schmittian ontology. She dismisses
Kant\'s Perpetual Peace as \'a fantasy of at-oneness\...a world in which
differences have all been rubbed off\' and in which \'politics, which is
the way human beings have devised for dealing with their differences,
gets eliminated.\'83 She remains a committed liberal democrat and
espouses a moral community that stretches beyond the nation-state, which
strongly contrasts with Schmitt\'s hostility to liberalism and his
claustrophobic distinction between friend and enemy. However her image
of politics \-- which at its limits, she implies, requires the resort to
war as the only existentially satisfying way of resolving deep-seated
conflicts \-- reflects much of Schmitt\'s idea of the political and
Hegel\'s ontology of a fundamentally alienated world of nation-states,
in which war is a performance of being. She categorically states that
any effort to dismantle security dilemmas \'also requires the
dismantling of human beings as we know them\'.84 Whilst this would not
be true of all just war advocates, I suspect that even as they are so
concerned with the ought, moral theories of violence grant too much
unquestioned power to the is. The problem here lies with the confidence
in being \-- of \'human beings as we know them\' \-- which ultimately
fails to escape a Schmittian architecture and thus eternally exacerbates
(indeed reifies) antagonisms. Yet we know from the work of Deleuze and
especially William Connolly that [exchanging an ontology of being for
one of becoming, where the boundaries and nature of the self contain new
possibilities through agonistic relation to others, provides **a less
destructive and violent way of acknowledging and dealing with conflict
and difference**]{.underline}**.**85 My argument here, whilst
normatively sympathetic to Kant\'s moral demand for the eventual
abolition of war, militates against excessive optimism.86 Even as I am
arguing that [**[war]{.mark} is not an enduring historical or
anthropological feature, or a neutral and rational instrument of
policy**]{.underline} \-- that [**it is** rather **[the product of
hegemonic forms of knowledge about political action and
community]{.mark}**]{.underline} \-- my analysis does suggest some
sobering conclusions about its power as an idea and formation. Neither
the progressive flow of history nor the pacific tendencies of an
international society of republican states will save us. The violent
ontologies I have described here in fact dominate the conceptual and
policy frameworks of modern republican states and have come, against
everything Kant hoped for, to stand in for progress, modernity and
reason. Indeed what Heidegger argues, I think with some credibility, is
that [the enframing world view has come to stand in for being
itself.]{.underline} Enframing, argues Heidegger, \'does not simply
endanger man in his relationship to himself and to everything that
is\...it drives out every other possibility of revealing\...the rule of
Enframing threatens man with the possibility that it could be denied to
him to enter into a more original revealing and hence to experience the
call of a more primal truth.\'87What I take from Heidegger\'s argument
\-- one that I have sought to extend by analysing the militaristic power
of modern ontologies of political existence and security \-- is a view
that the challenge is posed not merely by a few varieties of weapon,
government, technology or policy, but by an overarching system of
thinking and understanding that lays claim to our entire space of truth
and existence. [[Many of the most destructive features of contemporary
modernity]{.mark} \-- militarism, repression, coercive diplomacy, covert
intervention, geopolitics, economic exploitation and ecological
destruction \-- [derive]{.mark} not merely from particular choices by
policymakers based on their particular interests, but [from
calculative]{.mark}, [\'empirical\' discourses of scientific and
political truth]{.mark} rooted in powerful enlightenment images of
being. [Confined within such an epistemological]{.mark} and cultural
[universe, policymakers\' choices become necessities]{.mark}, [their
actions become inevitabilities, and humans suffer and die]{.mark}.
Viewed in this light, **[\'rationality\' is the name we give the chain
of reasoning which builds one structure of truth on another until a
course of action, however violent]{.mark} or dangerous, [becomes
preordained]{.mark} through that reasoning\'s very operation and
existence**. [It creates]{.mark} both [discursive constraints -]{.mark}-
available choices may simply not be seen as credible or legitimate \--
[and material constraints]{.mark} that derive from the mutually
reinforcing cascade of discourses and events [which]{.mark} then
**[preordain militarism and violence as necessary policy
responses,]{.mark} however ineffective, dysfunctional or
chaotic**.]{.underline}

### 2NC Diplomacy---AT Liberal IR Theory/Treaty Works

#### Conflict is inherent within diplomacy -- verbal texts like treaties refer to latent military power that makes them credible, and military power gains its credibility through signaling of intentions -- their transformation of the question into yes/no peace depoliticizes the fundamental question of types and trajectories of struggle and interpretation

[**McCanles '84** (Michael, Prof. of English @ Marquette, Machiavelli
and the Paradoxes of Deterrence, Diacritics, Vol. 14, No. 2, Nuclear
Criticism, (Summer, 1984), pp. 12-19, JSTOR)]{.underline}

On the one hand, **[the verbal texts of]{.underline}** dispatches,
**[diplomatic missions]{.underline}**, treaties, **[and
ultimatums]{.underline}** are, and have always been, understood as
tissues of verbal signifiers **[refer]{.underline}**ring **[beyond
themselves to the "real" power that gives these whatever force they
claim.]{.underline}** Diplomatic discourse in this perspective is a set
of signifiers that are empty unless they point toward a transverbal
military signified. **[But]{.underline}** on the other hand, Machiavelli
saw that **[military maneuver]{.underline}**---the deployment of men and
*materiel*, the palpably visible pageant of cavalry, infantry,
artillery, and impedimenta moving across the countryside, usurping the
roads, routing peasants and poultry, approaching the watchtowers of city
walls---**[is also a discourse]{.underline}**, a set of signifiers. And
as a set of signifiers **[such [gestures]{.mark}]{.underline}** can
[**[find]{.underline}** t]{.mark}heir signifieds, [**[their
meanings]{.underline}**, **[only in the discourses they evoke in the
minds]{.underline}**]{.mark} and mouths **[[of those perceiving
them.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[The deployment of armies
remains]{.underline}** a **[mute]{.underline}** language, void of
meaning and therefore impotent, **[until]{.underline}** they are
**[transcoded into discourse, and]{.underline}** thereby
**[given]{.underline}** both a meaning and **[the power to
threaten.]{.underline}** The full significance of Machiavelli's treating
the reciprocity between military capability and verbal threats as a
continual circulation of signs and interpretations of signs, can only be
appreciated in the context of his experience as diplomat and head of the
Florentine Second Chancellery (concerned with foreign affairs).
Governing Florentine diplomacy's strategies was, as Felix Gilbert has
shown \[*Machiavelli and Guicciardini: Politics and History in
Sixteenth*-*Century Florence* (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1965),
pp. 37ff\], the assumption that men\'s political and military behavior
is within certain margins predictable because all men can reasonably be
expected to do what will best serve their interests. Machiavelli\'s own
voluminous legations, his diplomatic reports to the Second Chancellery,
show that for him **[[the diplomat\'s function as]{.underline}]{.mark}**
listener, **[[observer of gestures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and gatherer
of information **[made him one terminus of a semiotic
circuit]{.underline}**, the other end of which was the committee of the
Ten of War, whose business it was to interpret the many bits of
information thus delivered to it. Since all men\'s modes of reasoning
are essentially identical one could on this basis reconstruct the
thinking and therefore the intentions of one\'s allies and enemies. All
of this meant that **[[the continual]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
week-by-[week **[confrontation between centers of
military]{.underline}**]{.mark} and political **[[power took
place]{.mark} rarely on the battlefield, and most often [in the
exchanges of texts between diplomats]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Military
maneuver was itself only an extension of diplomatic display, just as
diplomatic display was an extension of the aggrandizement embodied at
its most extreme in military maneuver[. **[Events]{.underline}**]{.mark}
themselves **[[only became meaningful as]{.mark}]{.underline}** either
**[the [consequences of previous text]{.mark}s or the causes
of]{.underline}** still **[further interpretive texts.]{.underline}**
**[Any intelligible account of events had to include the]{.underline}**
reasoning and **[intentions of the persons who initiated
them]{.underline}**, carried them out, **[and reacted to
them.]{.underline}** For Machiavelli writing the history of events meant
reconstructing the texts by which events were generated and interpreted
\[Michael McCanles, The Discourse of \"II Principe\'\" Humana Civitas
Series No. 8, The Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, UCLA
(Malibu: Undena Publications, 1983)\]. Seen in this light,
Machiavelli\'s various exhortations in Chapters Fifteen and following in
II Principe, regarding the ways in which the successful prince must
always prepare to project various false appearances, do not add up
merely to the counsel to lie and lie mightily. Machiavelli is addressing
the fact that the power to coerce others lies not alone in the personal
and collective virtb of the Machiavellian prince and his army, but in
another form of virtb, that invested in the prince\'s understanding that
what coerces others is the power to threaten. All this means, however,
something more than the obvious fact that others can always, up to a
point, be persuaded as much by what one says as by what one does. It
requires in addition understanding the first of four paradoxes of
deterrence I shall develop in this paper, because only the prince who
understands the intrinsic instability of deterrence will be able to use
it without becoming subject to this instability in turn. To understand
this paradox, and to prepare the way for my main subject, namely the
paradoxes of deterrence as they arise from the world\'s present
desperate situation of nuclear deterrence, one must first examine the
nature of threats in general. In order **[[for the prince to threaten
successfully he must live in a political world which assumes that all
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**, embodied in the texts of oaths,
treaties, diplomatic orations, and dispatches, **[refer]{.underline}**
in fact **[beyond themselves to]{.underline}** a transtextual domain of
**[actual military power[. People]{.mark}]{.underline}** will
**[[respond to the power]{.mark}]{.underline}** textualized **[[in
discourse]{.mark} only as long as they]{.underline}** believe that such
an entity as power distinct from discourse really exists, and **[remain
ignorant that the prince]{.underline}**, being always an emperor with no
clothes on, **[becomes powerful only when they dress him in that
power.]{.underline}** In this connection the second half of II Principe
calls the prince to recognize **[the profound equivocation that
undergirds the threat]{.underline}**ening textualization
**[of]{.underline}** political and **[military maneuver]{.underline}**.
This equivocation **[is the circular validation of text by force and of
force by text]{.underline}**, a validation **[that asserts a \"real\"
origin for a power that]{.underline}** in fact **[only achieves the
power to threaten posterior to textualization itself.]{.underline}** The
prince in order to use and not be used by the circulation of texts he
participates in must recognize discourse\'s capacity to create what
Roland Barthes calls the \"illusion of the referent\" \[Roland Barthes,
\"Le discours de I\'histoire,\" Social Science Information 6, No. 4
(1967), pp. 65-75\]. To remain blind to this illusion is to remain blind
to the semiotic circulation binding texts and military force, and
ultimately to the ways in which **[[texts]{.mark}]{.underline}** may
**[[posit]{.mark}]{.underline}** a source and **[[origin for themselves
in a transtextual reality of military force that]{.mark}]{.underline}**
in fact **[[does not come into existence as a threat until the text
posits it.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

## Prolif/Arms Control

#### The NPT and anti-prolif discourse treat Third World nations as unique threats- the logic of their plan assumes fundamental cultural differences between the West and its others that can be used as basis for making racist political divisions- you should be suspicious of their truth claims because they're self-serving and polarizing

[**Gusterson '99,** (Hugh, Anthropologist @ MIT, Nuclear Weapons and the
Other in the Western Imagination, Cultural Anthropology Vol. 14, No. 1
Feb. 1999 pp. 111-143, JSTOR)]{.underline}

According to the literature on risk in anthropology, shared fears often
reveal as much about the identities and solidarities of the fearful as
about the actual dangers that are feared (Douglas and Wildavsky 1982;
Lindenbaum 1974). The [immoderate reactions]{.underline} in the West [to
the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan]{.underline}, and to
Iraq\'s nuclear weapons program earlier, [are examples of an entrenched
discourse on nuclear proliferation that has played an important role in
structuring the Third World, and our relation to it]{.underline}, in the
Western imagination. This discourse, dividing the world into nations
that can be trusted with nuclear weapons and those that cannot, dates
back, at least, to the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970. [[The
N]{.underline}]{.mark}on-[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}roliferation
[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}reaty [[embodied a bargain between the five
countries that had nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1970 [[and
those]{.underline}]{.mark} countries [[that did
not]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to the bargain, the five official
nuclear states (the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom,
France, and China)(FN3) promised to assist other signatories to the
treaty in acquiring nuclear energy technology as long as they did not
use that technology to produce nuclear weapons, submitting to
international inspections when necessary to prove their compliance.
Further, in Article 6 of the treaty, the five nuclear powers agreed to
\"pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to
cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear
disarmament\" (Blacker and Duffy 1976:395). One hundred eighty-seven
countries have signed the treaty, but **[Israel, India, and Pakistan
have refused, saying it enshrines a system of global \"nuclear
apartheid.\"]{.underline}** Although the Non-Proliferation Treaty
divided the countries of the world into nuclear and nonnuclear by means
of a purely temporal metric (FN4)\--designating only those who had
tested nuclear weapons by 1970 as nuclear powers\--[[the treaty has
become the]{.mark} [legal anchor for a global nuclear regime that is
increasingly legitimated]{.mark} in Western public discourse [in
racialized terms]{.mark}.]{.underline} In view of recent developments in
global politics\--the collapse of the Soviet threat and the recent war
against Iraq, a nuclear-threshold nation in the Third World\--[the
importance of this discourse in organizing Western geopolitical
understandings is only growing.]{.underline} [[It has become an
increasingly important way of legitimating U.S. military
programs]{.underline}]{.mark} in the post-Cold War world **[since the
early 1990s, when U.S. military leaders introduced the term rogue
states]{.underline}** into the American lexicon of fear, identifying a
new source of danger just as the Soviet threat was declining (Klare
1995).     Thus in Western discourse [[nuclear weapons are represented
so that \"theirs\" are a problem whereas \"ours\" are
not]{.mark}.]{.underline} During the Cold War the Western discourse on
the dangers of \"[nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}\" defined
the term in such a way as to sever the two senses of the word
proliferation. This usage [[split off the \"vertical\"]{.mark}
proliferation of the superpower]{.underline} arsenals (the development
of new and improved weapons designs and the numerical expansion of the
stockpiles) [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the [\"[horizontal\"
proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline} of nuclear weapons to other
countries, [[presenting only the latter as]{.mark} the \"proliferation
[problem]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} Following the end of the Cold War, the
American and Russian arsenals are being cut to a few thousand weapons on
each side.(FN5) However, the United States and Russia have turned back
appeals from various nonaligned nations, especially India, for the
nuclear powers to open discussions on a global convention abolishing
nuclear weapons. Article 6 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty
notwithstanding, the Clinton administration has declared that nuclear
weapons will play a role in the defense of the United States for the
indefinite future. Meanwhile, in a controversial move, the Clinton
administration has broken with the policy of previous administrations in
basically formalizing a policy of using nuclear weapons against
nonnuclear states to deter chemical and biological weapons (Panofsky
1998; Sloyan 1998). [[The dominant discourse that stabilizes this system
of]{.mark} nuclear [apartheid]{.mark}]{.underline} in Western ideology
[[is a]{.underline}]{.mark} specialized variant within a broader
[[system of colonial]{.underline}]{.mark} and postcolonial
[[discourse]{.mark} that takes as its essentialist premise a profound
Otherness separating Third World from Western
countries.]{.underline}(FN6) This inscription of Third World (especially
Asian and Middle Eastern) nations as ineradicably different from our own
has, in a different context, been labeled \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said
(1978). Said argues that [[orientalist discourse constructs the world in
terms of a series of binary oppositions]{.mark} that produce the Orient
as the mirror image of the West]{.underline}: [where \"[we\" are
rational]{.mark}]{.underline} and disciplined, [\"[they\" are
impulsive]{.mark}]{.underline} and emotional; where \"we\" are modern
and flexible, \"they\" are slaves to ancient passions and routines;
where \"we\" are honest and compassionate, \"they\" are treacherous and
uncultivated. While the blatantly racist orientalism of the high
colonial period has softened, more subtle orientalist ideologies endure
in contemporary politics. They can be found, as Akhil Gupta (1998) has
argued, in discourses of economic development that represent Third World
nations as child nations lagging behind Western nations in a uniform
cycle of development or, as Lutz and Collins (1993) suggest, in the
imagery of popular magazines, such as National Geographic. I want to
suggest here that another variant of contemporary orientalist ideology
is also to be found in U.S. national security discourse.

#### The idea that other countries lack the technical maturity to safely own weapons is how we quell in our anxiety over our own arsenals. It is our nuclear amnesia which has legitimized a history of preparation for nuclear war and makes miscalculation inevitable.

[The third argument against horizontal proliferation is that Third World
nations may lack the technical maturity to be trusted with nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. The Washington Post quotes an unnamed Western
diplomat stationed in Pakistan, who, worrying that India and Pakistan
lack the technology to detect an incoming attack on their weapons, said
[the United States has "expensive space-based surveillance that could
pick up the launches, but Pakistan and India have no warning systems. I
don't know what their doctrine will be. Launch when the wind

[training tape led personnel]{.mark} in the strategic command apparatus
[to think a Soviet **attack was underway**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
American interceptor planes were scrambled and air traffic controllers
were told to bring down commercial planes before U.S. military
commanders detected the error. [As for the American safety record in
transporting and handling nuclear weapons, there is more cause for
relief than for complacency. [There have]{.mark}]{.underline}, for
example, [[been at least twenty-four occasions when]{.underline}]{.mark}
American [[aircraft]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[accidentally released
nuclear weapons and]{.underline}]{.mark} at least [[eight incidents
where]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[nuclear weapons were involved in plane
crashes]{.mark} or fires]{.underline}.14 In other words[, **[the U.S.
nuclear arsenal has its own safety problems]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[related to its dependence on highly computerized warning]{.mark} and
detection [systems,]{.mark} the cold war practice of patrolling oceans
and skies with live nuclear weapons, and large stockpile size. Even
where U.S. scientists have developed special safety technologies, they
have not always been used. [The presumption that Third World countries
lack the technical competence]{.mark} to be trusted with nuclear weapons
fits our stereotypes about those countries' backwardness**, but it
[distracts us from asking whether we ourselves have the technical
infallibility the weapons]{.mark} ideally [require.]{.mark}** The
discourse on proliferation assumes that the superpowers' massive
arsenals of highly accurate, MIRVed missiles deployed on hair-trigger
alert were stable and that the small, elemental arsenals of new nuclear
nations would be unstable, but one could quite plausibly argue the
reverse**. This leaves one wondering whether prejudices about the
weapons' owners are not masquerading as technical concerns about weapons
configurations and safety protocols.**]{.underline}

### Link---Arms Control---1NC 

#### The rhetoric of arms control is nothing more than power politics---their construction of reality embraces a view of international relations manufactured by rigid forms of thinking that colonizes all resistance---ultimate conventional and nuclear escalation is the inevitable result of the Affirmative's ontological violence because their praxis makes insecurity an ever-present condition of the world. The permutation colonizes resistance and brackets our alternative. 

[**Walker 84** \[RBJ, Professor of Political Science at the University
of Victoria, 1984, "Culture, Ideology, and World Order," pg.
312-316\]]{.underline}

The most immediately pressing aspects of contemporary militarism are
undoubtedly those arising from the nuclear confrontation between the
superpowers. It is certainly this particular issue, rather than the
broader spread of militaristic tendencies, that has become the focus of
public concern. [Those who have been motivated primarily in universalist
moral terms have come to be familiar with the arcane language of
deterrence theory, to appreciate the difference between first and second
strikes and the significance of counterforce technology.]{.underline}
Similarly, socioeconomically oriented radicals have come to accept the
need to make accommodation with advocates of minimum deterrence, and to
assert the immediate priority of reversing and stabilizing the current
arms race. 3 [Despite the theoretical priority of universalist
perspectives, in practice short-run survival comes first]{.underline}.
[This position]{.underline} is hardly surprising, but it [involves a
number of problems. [Although the]{.mark} critique of contemporary
militarism that arises from the [strategic]{.mark} geopolitical
[argument does show]{.mark} very clearly the [dangers]{.mark} that are
intrinsic [to nuclear deterrence, this]{.mark} same critique also
[accepts all the assumptions]{.mark} about the nature of world politics
that are **[rooted in]{.mark} the [dominant discourse about
international politics]{.mark}**. To attempt to develop any
counter-hegemonic discourse at this level is to operate on terms
**already set out by the dominant discourse**]{.underline}. These terms
are not obviously the most productive starting point for developing a
more coherent vision of world order or more appropriate modes of peace
and security. [The strategic-geopolitical critique begins with the
**destabilization of the contemporary structures of nuclear
deterrence**. It dwells on two main difficulties in particular: the move
toward counterforce doctrines and missile vulnerability at the level of
strategic deterrence forces, and the difficulties created by
technologies of extended deterrence or flexible response]{.underline} in
Europe. [[The]{.mark} overall [drift]{.mark} is [from]{.mark} a strategy
of [war prevention to]{.mark} one of [war fighting]{.mark}**. The
prescription [involves]{.mark} some form of [arms control]{.mark}**.
Some versions can be quite sweeping in their
recommendations:]{.underline} **[[hence]{.mark} proposals for nuclear
free zones, [pledges of no first use]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
comprehensive **[test bans, [deep cuts]{.mark}, the [substitution of
conventional for]{.mark} some [nuclear forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
and so on. [Most advocates of this way of thinking would like to restore
some kind of minimum deterrence.]{.underline} And on the whole such
prescriptions seem inherently sensible\--until we ask what happens next.
[Beyond minimum deterrence lie suggestions for denuclearization, for the
[delegitimization of nuclear weapons in]{.mark} the resolution of
international [disputes]{.mark}**. These suggestions always
[introduce]{.mark} the [increased risk of conflict escalation]{.mark}
associated [with conventional weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which
nuclear deterrence policies have to some extent been able to restrain.
In any case, **[[to see the problem]{.mark} of contemporary militarism
[only in]{.mark} terms of [nuclear weapons is to be aware of only the
tip of a large iceberg]{.mark}.]{.underline}** So beyond
denuclearization lies a more general demilitarization and the
development of alternative forms of civilian defense and global
peacekeeping. Yet in the conventional view, such things seem very, very
far away, as they may well be. [It is]{.underline} thus [necessary to
ask whether the conventional view of things is the appropriate one to
take, and at this point the issues get much more difficult. They take us
into a vortex of complicated theoretical and]{.underline}, indeed,
[philosophical problems with the main traditions of international
political analysis.]{.underline} One of the most obvious but least noted
aspects of Western theories of world politics\--and I am thinking here
primarily in terms of \"the American science of international
relations\"\--is that like all sociopolitical theories, they can be
understood both as \"theory\" and as \"ideology.\" They function both as
systematic attempts to understand and explicate phenomena and,
simultaneously, as ways of obscuring the phenomena. Attempts to analyse
the nature of international relations theory as ideology have been few
and far between, certainly when compared with other socioscientific
disciplines. Yet there can be little doubt that [**[the dominant
discourse about i]{.mark}**nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations **has
served to [legitimize]{.mark} as well as to explain [the
prevailing]{.mark} international [order]{.mark}.**]{.underline} To
pursue this theme it is necessary to emphasize the way in which
[[the]{.mark} prevailing [discourse]{.mark} about international politics
**[embodies a particular ontology]{.mark}, a particular conception of
the nature of international \"reality.\"**]{.underline} Some aspects of
this have already been noted in passing. Against those who think in
universalist moral terms, it is argued that the international realm is
essentially pluralistic and amoral. It is a matter of the continuous
collision of particular states mitigated only by fragile and temporary
structures of diplomacy and rules of accommodation. Against those who
think in socioeconomic terms, it is argued that the state, the most
fundamental form of pluralist fragmentation, is to a very large degree
autonomous as a result of the \"security dilemma.\" Yet it makes very
little philosophical sense to speak of any notion of pluralism without
also invoking its universalist polarity. Historically, the fragmented
international political system seems to have developed as part of an
increasingly integrated economic system. Thus in both cases, it can be
argued that [the predominant tradition of international relations theory
has, at best [operated with]{.mark} a **highly [selective]{.mark} vision
of \"[reality]{.mark}.\"**]{.underline} **[The problem goes
deeper]{.underline}**. Philosophically, traditions of pluralism are
associated with those of historicism. [The idea that the world is
\"one\" is opposed by the idea that it is \"many.\" The idea that the
\"one\" is unchanging is opposed by the idea that the world is
constantly changing.]{.underline} [If the world is one and unchanging
then it is possible to have a certain and unchanging knowledge of it; if
not, then knowledge can only be relative to the time at which it is
grasped]{.underline}. The problem goes back a long way. It is the
pluralist and relativist challenge of Thrasymachus the Sophist in the
Republic that sets Western political theory off in its most
characteristic quest. It is Machiavelli\'s pluralist and historicist
challenge to the universalist claims of Christianity that articulated
the setting for modern secular political thought in general and for
international political theory in particular. Where the political theory
of civil society has subsequently managed to develop a more
universalistic basis for political life, starting with the
secularization of natural law and the development of social contract
theory, international political theory has remained preoccupied by the
problems of pluralism, relativism, and historicism. Ultimately it is on
this philosophical basis that the claims of the dominant discourse of
international politics over those who think in universalist moral or
socioeconomic terms have been made. 4 And as a critical weapon against
universalistic pretensions, relativism can be deadly. Ultimately, of
course, it is self-defeating: if everything is relative, then the
statement itself is contradictory. Even so, there are important
philosophical issues here, issues that certainly do not justify the
general disrepute into which pluralism, historicism, and relativism have
fallen. Unfortunately, this old philosophical puzzle is not all there is
to it. By the time the claims of historicism, pluralism, and relativism
became dressed up in the garb of modern international relations theory,
they became distorted in several important ways. 5 First, they became
absolutized, either in terms of some concept of an unchanging human
nature derived from Hobbes, ethology, or Protestant theology, or in
terms of some notion of the eternal verities of power politics.
Secondly, the claims of universalism and pluralism, the \"one\" and the
\"many,\" came to be reified into a mutually exclusive opposition rather
than as moments of a dialectic. Thus on the one hand we have seen the
development of a \"science\" of international politics to legitimize its
claims to objectivity; and on the other we have seen all the rhetorical
devices of relativism being deployed against any position that bases
itself on some claim to universalism. The theoretical issues that arise
from this are of great complexity. Considered in terms of ideology,
however, the consequences are much simpler. over a long period of
historical development, one way of thinking about international
politics\--what in its more \"authentic\" forms can be called pluralism
or historicism, but now in a degenerate ahistorical form are known as
\"realism\"\--has come to dominate all others. And it has done so not
because its conception of \"reality\" is more accurate, but because its
partial grasp of that \"reality\" has been legitimized through some
deeply rooted intellectual trickery. Consequently other forms of
discourse have been delegitimized. And the discourses that have suffered
most in this way are precisely those that give rise to the socioeconomic
and universalist moral critiques of contemporary militarism. The
discourse of dissent to contemporary militarism can therefore be
dissected in two ways. It is possible to categorize the different forms
of critique and to understand their characteristic impact in the
political sphere. It is also possible to understand the internal
dynamics of critique when considered as a totality. We then have two
different ways of addressing the same basic issue of the extent to which
the critique of contemporary militarism is able to undermine the
hegemonic discourse of international politics. [Although there is a
clear convergence toward a common [indictment]{.mark} of militarism from
a number of different theoretical traditions**, they [are in danger of
being channeled]{.mark} in ways determined [by]{.mark} the dominant
discourse**]{.underline}. In effect, [**they all confront [a hegemonic
discourse]{.mark} that is [able to define]{.mark} the kind of
[opposition it can tolerate]{.mark}.** Once the critique of contemporary
militarism is **[trapped in this]{.mark} discourse** it becomes
vulnerable to a wide range of difficulties]{.underline}. Most obviously
[**[it is subject to delegitimation]{.mark} by being labeled as utopian
or subversive**. Such labeling is not simply a political ploy. It is
**rooted in the hegemonic discourse of international relations theory
itself**]{.underline}. Less obviously, **[the pluralistic [ontological
assumptions of]{.mark} this hegemonic discourse necessarily pose
[the]{.mark} \"[problem]{.mark} of the [other]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\"
or what has more recently come to be known as orientalism. The pluralist
assumptions of the discourse [**[are constantly re-enforced by]{.mark}
the [stereotyping]{.mark} of some other state [in ways that justify
aggression]{.mark}**[. The appeal to \"realism\" and]{.mark} the appeal
to [some]{.mark} \"great [enemy\" constitute **a self-justifying and
self-perpetuating system** ]{.mark}**of assumptions**. Critiques of
militarism can then be dismissed not only in terms of being utopian or
subversive in general, but utopian and subversive with respect to some
specific and historically constituted enemy]{.underline}. One is then
not merely naive, but is a dupe of some devil personified. **[Not only
is the hegemonic discourse of international politics self-justifying and
self-perpetuating, but to the extent that it recognizes its own
limitations, [it]{.mark} also [circumscribes the solutions]{.mark} that
are [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More specifically, [it undermines
the idea of a possible progression from nuclear deterrence [to]{.mark}
demilitarization and **prescribes only the [stabiliz]{.mark}ation of
[the status quo]{.mark}. The \"realities\" are said to indicate [that
nuclear deterrence]{.mark} of some sort [will always be
necessary]{.mark}, and that arms control is all that is possible, even
if it is an arms control that can allow for some quite drastic
reductions in the level of armaments.**]{.underline} **[And in this way
[it is always possible to hide behind]{.mark} a [rhetoric of arms
control while continuing]{.mark} to play [the game of bargaining chips
and supremacy.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### 2NC Arms Control---Turns Case

#### Arms control merely legitimizes and secures the US arsenal---this reinforces status quo nuclear institutions, locking an a statist understanding of IR and propelling a global drive towards nuclearization

[**Kaldor '9** (Mary, professor of global governance at the London
School of Economics, Dismantling the global nuclear infrastructure,
8/11/09,
http://www.opendemocracy.net/article/dismantling-the-global-nuclear-infrastructure)]{.underline}

But how would such a summit be climbed? Most of these proposals have
their origins in the period when the new anti-nuclear activists were
politicians and when their main concern was to reduce the risks of the
nuclear arms race while preserving the capabilities of existing nuclear
powers. This was the essence of what were then known as 'arms control\'
rather than disarmament measures. Reductions of American and Russian
nuclear warheads will still leave both countries with enough nuclear
capacity to destroy the world several times over. [[The **NPT**
and]{.mark} the [**CTBT** are designed to constrain the]{.mark}
[development of nuclear weapons by new powers but]{.mark}]{.underline},
in effect, [[**legitimise** existing]{.mark}
[arsenals.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, it could even be argued that
[[by]{.mark} implicitly [endorsing the nuclear status of great
powers]{.mark}, [they represent an **incentive**]{.mark} [for emerging
powers]{.mark} like Iran or North Korea [to acquire]{.mark} nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The proposals for **securing** and
**limiting** **nuclear stockpiles** are]{.underline} likewise [designed
to prevent nuclear capacity getting into the wrong hands while
protecting the stockpiles of existing nuclear powers.]{.underline} But
they cannot, of themselves, prevent the manufacture of weapons grade
materials by Iran, say, or, a further example, the export of nuclear
know-how by rogue elements in Pakistan. [[Arms control proposals are
based on a geo-political statist understanding of the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline} The possession and implicit threat to use
nuclear weapons is associated with an absolutist view of state
sovereignty. [The possession of nuclear weapons implies an absolutist
prerogative on the part of states to risk the lives of its own citizens
on a massive scale not to mention citizens in other
countries]{.underline} [without any prior **public debate**]{.underline}
or discussion. The use of nuclear weapons would constitute an
unimaginable violation of human rights and hence the implication of
their possession is that states have the right to inflict such an
unimaginable violation. In Europe, where most nuclear weapons are still
American, it is not even European states that have this absolutist
character, it is the American President alone who is allowed to risk the
lives of European citizens. [[The problem with arms control
proposals]{.mark} [is that they]{.mark} treat nuclear weapons as thought
they were part of the normal armoury of states - they [**naturalise**
nuclear weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline} And yet [[we cannot ascend to the
top of the mountain]{.underline}]{.mark} without changing those
fundamental assumptions and [[without rethinking the implications of
possessing nuclear weapons]{.mark} in to-day\'s globalised
world.]{.underline}

### 2NC---Epistemology Indict

#### The aff's arms control policy locks in a liberal ideological framework for viewing nuclear weapons---this epistemology is riddled with myth and makes their reading of IR suspect- only a prior interrogation of their method can challenge the flaws in their perspective

[**Krause '7,** (Joachim, Professor for International Relations at the
Christian-Albrechts-University at Kiel, Enlightenment and Nuclear Order,
International Affairs 83: 3 (2007) 483--499)]{.underline}

Today's processes of [[global governance]{.mark} and international
regime-building [are]{.mark}]{.underline} to an increasing degree
[[shaped by]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called **[[epistemic
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [some]{.underline} of these
[have devised]{.underline} systems of beliefs and attitudes which, at
least, raise the question whether they are working on the basis of
[**ideologies** that make them immune to contradictory
evidence.]{.underline} Epistemic communities are usually valued as
important forces of progress, since they often invest energy into global
governance purposes. However, as John G. Ruggie has subtly pointed out,
there might be a problem: ['[epistemic communities]{.underline}]{.mark}
. . . may be said to consist of interrelated roles that group up around
an episteme: they [[delimit for their members]{.underline}]{.mark} the
"proper" construction of social reality'. Ruggie defines the term
episteme---which he borrowed from Michel Foucault---as [[a 'dominant way
of looking at social reality]{.mark}, a set of shared symbols and
references, mutual expectations and a mutual predictability of
intention'.]{.underline}9 It is no secret that the political agenda of
arms control and, in particular, of nuclear non-proliferation has been
influenced over the past four decades by [[the school of **liberal arms
control**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This epistemic community [[has defined
the basic tenets of international arms control]{.mark} and
non-prolif]{.underline}eration [[politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} It
encompasses not only scholars and researchers, but also a large number
of diplomats, politicians, bureaucrats and journalists. Members of this
school have shaped US arms control policy since the 1960s, many experts
from that community having served various US administrations. But the
group has also found adherents outside the United States. International
arms control diplomacy has been to a great extent the result of diligent
and devoted efforts by liberal arms controllers from several parts of
the world. Without this epistemic community, international arms control
and non- proliferation efforts would not have been so successful. [[This
epistemic community]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, is not immune to the
disease of ideology. In fact, over the years it [[has devised an
ideological belief system of common tenets and attitudes that has led to
a growing divide between reality]{.mark} [and what members]{.mark} [of
that group think]{.mark} and believe.]{.underline} [The most relevant
indicator for the existence of such an ideology is that its [members
cling to historical 'facts' that turn out to be
myths]{.mark}]{.underline} as soon as one puts them to simple empirical
tests. [The article by]{.underline} William [Walker is itself an example
of how ideological tenets have taken over today's liberal arms control
school]{.underline}---with possibly negative political consequences.
What makes things difficult is that there is today a competing
ideological school: the several variants of assertive conservatism that
have shaped the Bush administration's policies. This assertive
conservatism (mainly misnamed neo-conservatism, although
neo-conservatism is just one strand) was promoted as an attempt to do
away with the ideologies of the liberal arms control school.
Unfortunately, what we have witnessed is the replacement of one ideology
by another one. So much has been written on the ideologies and errors of
the Bush administration that it would be futile even to list all these
analyses. But [the mere existence of an opposing conservative ideology
is no excuse for failing to analyse critically the ideology of liberal
arms control, since it is those ideological tenets that still dominate
in the global arms control and non-prolif]{.underline}eration
[community, and]{.underline} most [likely will become more powerful
again.]{.underline} This is where enlightenment comes in: first of all,
it means [**[to expose and debunk myths]{.mark}**. Only on the basis of
such an operation [can]{.mark} one [initiate an enlightened
debate.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2NC---Epistemology/ Reps 1^st^ 

#### The aff's framing of proliferation is not neutral- the 1ac is a series of interpretive acts that *constitute* both the subjects and objects of analysis- their choice to respond to proliferation with liberal international regimes relies on a series of problematic assumptions

[**Mutimer 2K,** (David, Associate Professor, Political Science @ York
University and Deputy Director @ Center for International and Security
Studies, The Weapons State: Proliferation and the Framing of Security,
pgs. 11-17)]{.underline}

**The prevailing view of the weapons proliferation problem** sees Iraq
as the harbinger of a wider security problem in the twenty-first
century, a problem produced by the proliferation of weapons and related
technologies. That view looks on the actions I outlined in Chapter 1 as
the sensible response of an international community to a threat it has
recognized only just in time, if not a little late. It **is** a view
neatly **presaged by** Charles **Krauthammer** in the same article in
which he introduced the weapon state: The post--Cold War era is thus
perhaps better called the era of weapons of mass destruction. The
**prolif**eration **of w**eapons of **m**ass **d**estruction and their
means of delivery **will constitute the greatest single threat to world
security for the rest of our lives. That is what makes a new**
[international order]{.underline} not an imperial dream or a Wilsonian
fantasy but **a matter of the sheerest prudence. It is slowly dawning on
the West that there is a need to establish some new**
[regime]{.underline} **to police these weapons and those who brandish
them.** [1](http://www.questia.com/read/105847239) I want to draw
attention to **several aspects of this quotation**, because they
**reveal the assumptions on which** it, and **the proliferation agenda**
more broadly, **are based.** The first key aspect of this short text is
Krauthammer\'s claim **that weapons proliferation will constitute the
greatest single threat to world security** for the rest of our lives. I
do not want to contest or qualify the claim but instead to ask what it
means---and perhaps as important, what is necessary for the claim to be
meaningful. It would seem initially that the meaning of the sentence in
question is self-evident: the process of weapons proliferation, of the
spread of weapons of mass destruction to more countries in more parts of
the world, threatens the world\'s security. Indeed, the meaning seems so
apparent that explanation of its meaning are more difficult to read than
the sentence itself. But is the meaning indeed so simple or, more to the
point, so unproblematic? First, [[Krauthammer\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}
claim [[**assumes a** single, identifiable phenomenon **that
is**]{.mark} **"the [prolif]{.mark}eration of weapons of mass
destruction and their means of delivery**.]{.underline} " The way in
which the weapons proliferation agenda was advanced following the Gulf
War seems to suggest that this has not always been the case. As I will
show in more detail in Chapter 3, for much of the Cold War period,
issues related to weapons of mass destruction and their means of
delivery were not commonly assumed to be part of a problem known as
proliferation. [[Krauthammer\'s claim also rests on the assumption that
there is]{.mark} an unproblematic whole known as [**world security**
that can be threatened.]{.mark}]{.underline} He assumes, that is, that
at some level the security of the world (whatever that may mean) is
indivisible. But what of the last sentence of the quotation? Krauthammer
argues that "it is slowly dawning on the West that there is a need to
establish some new regime to police these weapons and those who brandish
them. " [Within the space of a few lines, the "world security" with
which Krauthammer appeared to be concerned has become a problem
confronting "**the West**. "]{.underline} [Who are "those who brandish"
these weapons after proliferation?]{.underline} They are not individuals
or even groups of organized criminals, as his use of "police" might seem
to suggest. Rather, [it is "what might be called the \'**Weapon
State\'**"]{.underline} [2](http://www.questia.com/read/105847239) that
is holding and brandishing these weapons. Weapon states are members of
the international community--- Krauthammer cited Iraq, North Korea, and
Libya but suggested that it is possible for Argentina, Pakistan, Iran,
and South Africa to achieve this status. World security is perhaps less
universal than first imagined. It is also worth considering the
implications of Krauthammer\'s suggestion [that [the problem of
prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}eration, and the attendant growth of weapon
states, [[is "slowly dawning" on the West]{.mark}.]{.underline} For this
assertion [[to be meaningful]{.underline}, [there must be a
problem]{.underline}]{.mark} in the world somewhere (or in many places
at once) [[that]{.underline},]{.mark} for whatever reason, [[is hidden
from the view of "the West.]{.underline}]{.mark} " [There
must]{.underline}, in other words, [be a **rigid separation**
between]{.underline} the object in question---in this case, [the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}---[and the
viewing subject]{.underline}---in this case, [the West.]{.underline}
What is more, there must also be a clear, unproblematic subject. The
West is taken as a subject that can view, on which something can "dawn.
" Phrased in this way, perhaps the meaning of Krauthammer\'s short
quotation is less obvious. Although we conventionally speak of something
called "the West, " it is not readily apparent that it is sufficiently
singular for problems to "dawn" on it. What ties much of this together,
what makes the passage coherent, is suggested by Krauthammer\'s use of
prudence, the watchword of the traditional study and practice of
international security, a study founded on political realism. In his
classic statement of the principles of political realism, Hans
Morgenthau writes, "Realism, then, considers prudence ... to be the
supreme virtue in politics. " [3](http://www.questia.com/read/105847239)
Realism has been increasingly criticized in recent years in ways that
resonate with the questions I have posed regarding Krauthammer\'s
quotation. Realism, particularly the security study that forms a central
element of its view of international relations, has been accused of
serving Western---particularly U. S. ---policy in the name of the
international. What allows this political effect to pass unnoticed has
been realism\'s claim to objectivity---to the separation of subject and
object. Again, as Morgenthau puts it so succinctly, "Political realism
believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by
objective laws that have their root in human nature. "
[4](http://www.questia.com/read/105847239) If international politics is
governed by objective laws, then security is a neutral state of affairs
rather than politically biased. This objectivity also requires that both
the objects of study and the subjects who study or who view those
objects are also objectively knowable. Realism takes the objects of
social life and the subjects of social action to be constituted prior to
their entry into that action. Charles Krauthammer\'s short summation of
the problem of weapons proliferation is much richer in its meaning than
it might first appear. His quotation is founded on a series of
assumptions, which seem at least problematic once exposed to view.
Michel [Foucault has written that "practicing criticism is the art of
making facile gestures difficult.]{.underline} "
[5](http://www.questia.com/read/105847239) By making difficult what
seems at first blush so simple, not just in Krauthammer\'s formulations
but in the general understanding of the agenda of proliferation control,
I am joining a growing body of scholars who aim to practice criticism on
questions of security. [[This scholarship begins by suspending]{.mark}
what is commonly taken as given: [the objects of international
security]{.mark}]{.underline} (and security policy), [[the identities of
the subjects]{.mark} of international actions, [and]{.mark} even [the
interests these actors pursue]{.mark}. Each of these]{.underline}---the
objects, identities, and interests---[is assumed to be self-evident in
Krauthammer\'s quotation]{.underline}, as in security studies in
general. In the rest of this chapter I will question their self-evidence
and suggest a way of thinking about how the formation of the objects,
identities, and interests of weapons proliferation can be investigated
rather than assumed. Proliferation and Security Studies Ken Booth has
characterized the traditional study of security as follows: The
dominating security questions were: Is the Soviet threat growing? What
is the strategic balance? And would the deployment of a particular
weapon help stability? In that period of looking at world politics
through a missile-tube and gun-sight, weapons provided most of the
questions, and they provided most of the answers---whatever the weapon,
whatever the context, and whatever the cost.
[6](http://www.questia.com/read/105847239) Security concerned the
disposition of weapons and the use of those weapons to protect the
state---in particular the United States and, somewhat more generally,
its (European) allies but at root the state as an institution and an
actor in international relations. [[With security
considered]{.underline}]{.mark} in this way, [[through the missile tube,
the development of a **proliferation control
agenda**]{.underline}]{.mark} following the breakup of the Soviet Union
[[is not]{.mark} overly [surprising.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Soviet
threat was no longer an issue, but weapons still exist. Krauthammer\'s
suggestion that the weapon state might supplant the Soviet state as the
source of threat is a direct response to this change within the context
of security as traditionally conceived. Nevertheless, the idea that
security is provided through the acquisition of weaponry, that security
is what is achieved when you look at world politics through a missile
tube or a gun sight, has come in for sustained criticism in recent
years. This criticism was originally motivated by a recognition that it
was more than just the potential for interstate violence that rendered
people insecure---even during the Cold War with its ever-present
possibility of nuclear annihilation. The edifice of traditional
security, or strategic, studies proves much less stable than it might
have appeared at its Cold War height. [Once questions were asked about
the adequacy of an exclusive focus on weapons as a source of security,
[the very foundations of that building needed to be
reformed]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[7](http://www.questia.com/read/105847239) As with any conceptual
building, security study rested on a set of foundational assumptions,
which were usually unstated and unremarked. Once you probe a little into
the sources of threat, you run into these assumptions, and it becomes
difficult to the point of impossible to leave them unexamined. When you
look a little more closely, they turn out to be the same set of
assumptions I revealed in discussing the short passage from Krauthammer.
Strategic studies has taken as given a number of important aspects of
its field of study, of which the nature of the subject---the military
nature of security---is first and foremost. Strategic studies also takes
as given the referent object of that security and the subjects of
security practice, which turn out to be one and the same. It is states
that are to be secured through the deployment of particular weapons (or
through their elimination, or some other alteration in the general
disposition of the arsenal). It is also states that are to do the
securing through the "threat or use of military force. "
[8](http://www.questia.com/read/105847239) At the deepest and least
examined level, strategic studies takes as given the interests pursued
by states in seeking security. It is generally recognized, even by those
who adhere to a traditional understanding of security, that problems
other than military problems exist in international relations---they are
just not to be considered problems of security.
[9](http://www.questia.com/read/105847239) Similarly, most would accept
that there are actors other than the state and even that the reason for
providing security for the state is ultimately to provide security for
those who live in that state. Interests, however, are sacrosanct. These
crucial aspects of the study of security can be restated using the same
formulation I adopted earlier. Traditional approaches to security take
as given the objects, the identities of those who act, and the interests
they have. The critique of security studies began with the first of
these, suggesting that the object of study in security was, at the
least, too narrow. Once that was opened to question, however, identities
of the actors could no longer be assumed. If, for example, as Ken Booth
has argued, security is emancipation, then thinking of identities
defined solely in terms of the state is nonsensical.
[10](http://www.questia.com/read/105847240) Similarly, although perhaps
less obvious, the nature of interests is also changed as the object at
issue and the identities of the actors involved change---a point to
which I return in some detail later. The critique of traditional
security studies has therefore opened to question the objects of
security study---and, by extension, the practices through which security
is sought---as well as the identities of those who act to secure and,
finally, the interests these actors pursue. In doing so, critical
security studies connects with currents of critique that have been
developing in the discipline of international relations and, more
broadly, within social theory generally. Critique and Interpretation To
say that strategic studies and the political realism from which it grows
take aspects of their study as given means they are assumed to exist in
an unproblematic fashion and that they are accessible to study and
manipulation: there are states, they have interests, these interests are
threatened. [[The goal of security studies is to identify **threats**
and]{.mark} to develop [means by which states can safeguard their
**interests**]{.mark} in the face of those threats.]{.underline} This is
true of the academic study of security and of the study that takes place
within the apparatuses of states with a view to formulating security
policy. Indeed, in many instances and particularly in the mainstream of
security studies in the United States, these two activities are
inextricably related. [11](http://www.questia.com/read/105847240) The
trouble is that [as solid as they may appear, states and interests,
[threats and problems are not unproblematically presented to the
scholar\'s or]{.mark} even the [policymaker\'s
gaze]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the beginning of Writing Security, David
Campbell made this point in reference to the Gulf conflict, which plays
so central a role in the present story: On August 2, 1990, [Iraq became
a **danger** to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [For many,
this was obvious]{.underline}---nothing could be more real and less
disputable than an invasion of one country by another....
[Yet]{.underline}, without denying the brutality of such an action, the
unproblematic status with which this episode is endowed deserves
analysis. After all, [an event of this kind]{.underline} (particularly
one so distant from America) [does not in and of itself constitute a
danger]{.underline}, risk or threat.... Indeed, there have been any
number of examples in which similar "facts" were met with a very
different American reaction: only a decade earlier, [the Iraqi invasion
of Iran]{.underline} (an oil-producing state like Kuwait) [brought no
apocalyptic denunciations]{.underline} or calls to action---let alone a
military response---from the United States. [Danger is not an objective
condition.]{.underline} It is not a thing which exists independently of
those to whom it may become a threat.
[[^12^]{.underline}](http://www.questia.com/read/105847240) Campbell\'s
point is that [[danger]{.underline},]{.mark} threat, this central
concept in the study of security does not slowly dawn on those who are
threatened but rather [[is created through]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[**interpretive acts**.]{.underline}]{.mark} A further point is to be
made concerning Campbell\'s work. The focus of *Writing Security* is
not, in fact, on the way in which danger is interpreted---the manner by
which the interpretation of risk and the consequent creation of threat
occur. Rather, Campbell\'s argument shows the way in which [the
**interpreting subject**]{.underline}---in this instance the United
States---[is itself created by those acts of identifying
danger.]{.underline} If we can accept that both the threats and the
subjects of international security are created in acts of
interpretation, it should be clear that [the interests those subjects
pursue are also consequences of these same acts. It would be difficult
to argue that interests remain fixed when the bearer of those interests
does not.]{.underline} Jutta Weldes has made the case with respect to
interests: In contrast to the realist conception of "national interests"
as objects that have merely to be observed or discovered, then, my
argument is that national interests are social constructions created as
meaningful objects out of the intersubjective and culturally established
meanings with which the world, particularly the international system and
the place of the state in it, is understood. More specifically,
[[national interests emerge out of]{.mark} the [representations]{.mark}
... through which state officials and others make sense of the world
around them.]{.underline}
[[^13^]{.underline}](http://www.questia.com/read/105847240) These
"representations through which state officials and others make sense of
the world around them" are central to my argument in this book. Rather
than take the objects of study as given, I ask questions about the
construction of a particular object, a particular set of identities and
interests, and the specific practices through which proliferation is
confronted. [[The key to answering these questions is to
identify]{.underline}]{.mark} the way in which the problem is
represented or, to use the language I deploy [later, [the image that is
used to frame the issue in question]{.underline}]{.mark}[. This image
serves to construct the object of analysis or policy, to identify the
actors, and to define their interests. [It is]{.mark} therefore [the
image that enables the practices through which]{.mark} these [actors
respond to]{.mark} the problem of [prolif]{.mark}eration.]{.underline}

## Bioweapons

### Link---Bioweapons---1NC 

#### The affirmative's reactionary response to the bioweapon threat is an attempt to manage populations---their displacement of responsibility and politics makes the impact [inevitable.]{.underline}

University of California, Berkeley. His primary research is on the
design and implementation of new technologies of public health
surveillance, "From Chaos to Controlled Disorder": Syndromic

JS)]{.underline}

[[The enlistment of syndromic]{.underline}
[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark} [as a technology of vigilance
[against bioweapons]{.mark}]{.underline} dramatically [[refigures the
structures of security]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the circuits of warfare,
technologies of vigilance are sentinels, mechanisms that ensure the
enemy is visible and can therefore be repelled. As such, the boundaries
of their vision are also the boundaries of the defendable, of the
secure. As Manuel Delanda argues, the boundaries of security produce the
interiority that is the civil, political domain. When radar was first
developed, for example, its vigilance was technologically limited to the
territorial perimeter of the state. Later, however, the United States
expanded the radar curtain to enclose the entire continent and
ultimately, through the development of the nuclear umbrella, "enlarged
its 'walls' to global proportions.118 The enemy (and in particular
nuclear armaments) had nowhere to hide. The assumptions and vigilance
capacity of syndromic surveillance are far different than the integrated
radar system, characterized by uncertainty rather than global vision.
Even vigilance over the territory is considered impossible: [Because of
the incubation delays, [no nation can protect itself
]{.mark}]{.underline}[([from biological attack]{.underline}]{.mark}[)
simply by screening travelers at its borders]{.underline}. [[Nor can a
country such as the United States hope to inspect more than a fraction
of the food it imports daily]{.mark}.]{.underline} As agricultural
markets become increasingly global, the potential vulnerability of
nations to food-borne natural or intentional disease will continue to
increase.119 Rather than the territory of the state, [the [boundaries
of]{.mark} [syndromic vigilance run through the]{.mark} living bodies of
the [population]{.mark}.]{.underline} Only days after a bioweapon has
been released, when the sick begin to appear at emergency rooms and
hospitals, will any sign of the enemy's presence emerge. Rather than
looking for invasions across protected space (as radar does, for
example), syndromic surveillance monitors fluctuations in syndrome
levels over time. At stake is an assumed inability to prevent or defend
against bioweapons attacks. As Dr. William Roper narrated, while "the
public's expectations, not surprisingly, called for 100% protection with
no risks," the "goal of public health is to minimize risks." In this
context, the task of syndromic surveillance is to "shorten the time from
absolute chaos to controlled disorder."120 [Giorgio Agamben glosses
Foucault's concept of security in order to articulate the shifts in
contemporary geopolitical rationality]{.underline}. He writes: [While
disciplinary power isolates and closes off territories, measures of
security lead to an opening and globalisation]{.underline}; while the
law wants to prevent and prescribe, security wants to intervene in
ongoing processes to direct them. In a word, discipline wants to produce
order, while security wants to guide disorder.121 [[Biodefense]{.mark}
disease [surveillance]{.mark} guides and [manages the "controlled
disorder]{.mark}" of the microbehuman ecology in an increasingly
contagious world.]{.underline} One can perhaps imagine then a secured
population spreading beyond the confines of the national territory. The
future of war in an \'asymmetric\' age certainly does not appear to be
one that emphasizes the defense of borders. Rather, [specific
populations are watched and managed to ensure that the "controlled
disorder" of global flows of goods, people, microbes do not develop into
the chaos of epidemic.]{.underline} To conclude, I want to meditate on
the temporality of syndromic observation and, subsequently, my own
ethnographic observation. The objects and problems posed by these two
modes of inquiry (technological and anthropological) are quite distinct.
Yet both share the temporal space of the contemporary and the aspiration
of understanding our time. In important ways, the semantics of
temporality are in crisis. The history of progress that defined the
modern imagination has begun to fade. The destructive consequences of
so-called progress are ever more visible, particularly in ecological
damage but also in global poverty and violence. At the same time, dreams
of a perfectible future are ever more difficult to hold. [From
assymetric warfare to emerging infectious diseases, [the future is
increasingly presented as uncertain but]{.mark} potentially
[catastrophic]{.mark}. The rise of apocalyptic eschatologies is one
social response to present uncertainty. The logic is not foreign to the
bioterrorism discourse]{.underline}. Monica Schoch-Spana, for one, [has
demonstrated that bioterrorism scenarios used to imagine possible
futures have an apocalyptic character.]{.underline}122 In these texts,
computer games, or role-playing drills the threat of bioterrorism is
assumed at the outset to be inevitable: in Schoch-Spana's words, not a
matter of if, but when. In turn, [the inevitable threat is narrated in
catastrophic terms.]{.underline} In the response-game Dark Winter, for
example, smallpox quickly spread beyond the control of the role-playing
government, infecting tens of thousands and quickly reaching pandemic
scale. Or as Admiral Stansfield Turner sums up, biological weapons (like
none other than nuclear) have the capacity to bring the US past the
"point of non-recovery."123 An alternative ethical approach to the late
modern condition is characterized by the calculus of risk. Understanding
the contemporary in terms of risk means acknowledging that decisions in
the present shape an uncertain future with possible costs, though in
uncertain ways. Yet this uncertain future is not wholly unknowable in
the sense of an imminent danger. Risk "we construct between ourselves
\[while\] danger is 'out there,'" the way a map transforms land into a
cultural and political medium.124 As Francois Ewald writes of insurance
technologies, "for an event to be a risk, it must be possible to
evaluate its probability."125 Essential to the concept of risk is the
moral imperative to act in the present to reduce risks. The future is
not understood as an inevitable disaster that comes from somewhere 'out
there'. Rather, it is understood as uncertain and dangerous but
ultimately our responsibility. I have argued that [syndromic
surveillance]{.underline} utilizes a statistics of risk, but unlike
insurance technologies does not do so in order to discipline the future.
In essence, it [assumes the incomprehensibility of the future: the
appearance of the epidemic from somewhere 'out there]{.underline}.'
Rather than attempting to calculate the probability of a biological
weapons attack, [syndromic surveillance claims only to be able to
identify (but not define) the improbable when it occurs]{.underline}.
Syndromic surveillance refuses to understand the present in terms of
risk-based decision making. [All action is displaced into the
future]{.underline} where it is formulated in terms of response rather
than risk. If risks are eminently political, than syndromic surveillance
is a sort of anti-politics machine. [By displacing decisions into the
future, the space of politics in which decisions are debated **is also
displaced**]{.underline}. The system is designed to ensure that
disasters are visible when they occur so that they can be ameliorated:
so that "absolute chaos" can be turned to "controlled disorder". In
other words, syndromic technology ensures what Robert Paine calls the
"no-risk thesis": the refusal to turn a danger into a calculable risk.
By defining the future as incalculable but controllable, [syndromic
observation avoids confronting the influence present actions may have on
the future]{.underline}. By focusing on surveillance and response as the
primary method of dealing with the bioterrorism threat, [[the United
States displaces an understanding of how history has shaped the
contemporary threat.]{.underline} **[At stake]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[for the United States [is]{.mark} a denial of responsibility in the
production of global insecurity and therefore [the likelihood that
present actions will continue to exacerbate risky
circumstances.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Giorgio Agamben presents the
political dilemma: Maybe the time has come to work towards the
prevention of disorder and catastrophe, and not merely towards their
control. Today, there are plans for all kinds of emergencies
(ecological, medical, military), but there is no politics to prevent
them. . [. **[It is the task of democratic politics to prevent the
development of conditions which lead to]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[hatred, terror, and destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}**--**[and not
to reduce itself to attempts to control them once they
occur.]{.underline}**126 The approach to emerging infectious diseases is
revealing. The comparison is not random. Like the bioweapon, the future
emergence and character of novel infectious diseases has been defined as
highly uncertain. Proponents of syndromic surveillance argue that the
system is technologically capable of detecting unexpected natural
epidemics as well as deliberate ones. In short, if syndromic
surveillance works, then an unexpected natural epidemic (like a
bioweapons attack) becomes a controllable danger. Displaced by this
logic, however, is the way present actions are responsible for producing
infectious disease risks. [[The emergence of]{.mark} nearly every one of
these [new diseases has been ascribed to human
actions:]{.mark}]{.underline} Responsible factors include ecological
changes, such as those due to agricultural or economic development or to
anomalies in the climate; human demographic changes and behavior; travel
and commerce; technology and industry; microbial adaptation and change;
and breakdown of public health measures.127 Even [microbial
adaptation]{.underline} (increased pathogenicity or drug resistance)
[has been largely fueled by human interventions such as the
over-prescription of pharmaceuticals]{.underline}. And as Paul Farmer
suggests, [much of the contours and destructiveness of epidemics
generally can be attributed to social inequality]{.underline}.128
[[Pouring funding into]{.mark} improved surveillance [measures may be
able to control]{.mark} or ameliorate [an epidemic]{.mark} through early
detection ([although this,]{.mark} too, [is **highly
speculative**]{.mark}). However, the fundamental causes are displaced
and the unequally distributed costs are ignored.
[Controlled]{.mark}]{.underline} [[disorder may be secure for those
within the wealthy bastions of the world]{.mark}, where medical response
and intervention is readily available. [Yet]{.mark} as Farmer points
out, [while disease easily crosses borders]{.mark}, [biomedical
technologies]{.mark} and expertise [are]{.mark} typically [held up at
customs.]{.mark}129]{.underline} The circuits of war and politics enmesh
the bioweapon even more tightly than the emerging infection. Bioweapons
would often be artificially manufactured, altered through genesplicing,
or dispersed through aerosols; they would always be deliberately
released. This problematic hybrid of human intentions and natural
properties cannot be dealt with in either exclusively scientific or
political terms. Syndromic surveillance is built in response to the
failure of both science and diplomacy to solve the bioterrorism problem.
Yet [[instead of addressing the failing]{.mark} modern [division of
science from politics]{.mark}, [syndromic surveillance **displaces the
problem altogether**]{.mark}**.** The controlled disorder of syndromic
observation makes no claim to a scientific cure for the bioweapon (such
as rapid vaccine development); nor does it claim to a political cure
(such as nonproliferation). It offers no cure at all, displacing all
action to a future response and (all hopes to a controlled
disorder.)]{.underline} The anthrax mailings of October 2001 offer a
prime example of how response displaces responsibility. Leaving aside
the fact that syndromic surveillance could not have detected such a
small attack, the point is that a focus on emergency response displaced
the historical origins of the event. Rather than an unknowable danger
coming from 'out there', the roots of the anthrax attacks were fully
internal to the United States. The attacker has yet to be identified.
However, genetic investigations have determined that the bioweapon was
the rare and particularly virulent Ames strain of anthrax. Military labs
in the U.S. developed the Ames strains, either as an offensive weapon
during the 1960s or for ostensibly defensive research after the global
ban in 1972. The main custodian for the material is the U.S. Army lab at
Fort Detrick, who had loaned the material to other labs for research
purposes.130 [[By understanding attacks like these exclusively in terms
of]{.mark} disaster [response]{.mark}, **[the responsibility of the U.S.
military]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and in particular its biological
weapons programs) **[[is]{.mark} displaced and [forgotten. The costs are
clear.]{.mark} [Secret research on bioweapons]{.mark} [within military
institutions f]{.mark}or allegedly defensive purposes [continues and the
probability of]{.mark}]{.underline}** a pathological future, **[[a
future in which epidemic disorder becomes uncontrollable,
increases.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Their notion of protecting the people from a biological weapon is nothing more than an attempt to solidify state control over the population. Attempts to control biological weapons simply re-create a zone of indistinction by furthering state control over the lives and deaths of the population 

[**Pease '3** (Donald, Foundation Chair of the Humanities at Dartmouth,
"The Global Homeland State" boundary 2 30.3 (2003) 1-18, MUSE,

As we have seen, **[the Homeland enacted into law by the Homeland
Security Act did not have reference to an enclosed
territory]{.underline}**. And it was not exactly a political order. The
Homeland Security Act was the political instrument on whose authority
the state transformed a temporary suspension of order erected on the
basis of factual danger into a quasi-permanent biopolitical arrangement
that as such remained outside the normal order. After the passage of the
Homeland Security Act, **[the state of exception no longer referred to
an external state of factual danger and was instead identified with the
juridical-political order itself. This juridical-political apparatus
thereafter authorized a biopolitical settlement that inscribed the body
of the people into an order of state power that endowed the state with
power over the life and death of the population. 5 This biopolitical
sphere emerged with the state\'s decision to construe \[End Page 11\]
the populations it governed as indistinguishable from unprotected
biological life. Insofar as the Homeland State\'s biopolitical
imperative to regulate the life and death of the population that it
governed was irreducible to the denizens of the
nation-state,]{.underline}** the Homeland State\'s biopolitical regime
became potentially global in its extensibility[. **The body of the
people as a free and equal citizenry**]{.underline} endowed with the
capacity to reconstitute itself through recourse to historically
venerated social significations **[was replaced by a biological
population that the state protected from biological
terrorism.]{.underline}** The biopolitical sphere constructed by the
provisions of the Homeland Security Act first subtracted the population
from the forms of civic and political life through which they recognized
themselves as a national people and then positioned these life
forms---the people, their way of life---into nonsynchronous zones of
protection with the promise that their future synchronization would
resuscitate the nation-state. 6 In undergoing a generalized dislocation
from the national imaginary through which their everyday life practices
become recognizably \"American,\" the National Peoples underwent a mass
denationalization and were reconstituted as biological life forms. As
vulnerable biological life under the state\'s protection, the
biopoliticized population also could play no active political role in
the Homeland State\'s reordering of things. [**The Homeland State
thereafter represented the population as an unprotected biological
formation whose collective vitality must be administered and safeguarded
against weapons of biological terrorism.** **The state\'s description of
the weapons that endanger the aggregated population as \"biological\" in
part authorized the state\'s biopolitical settlement**]{.underline}.
**[In representing its biopolitical imperatives in terms of a defense
against weapons of biological destruction, the state also produced an
indistinction between politics and the war against
terrorism]{.underline}**. This redescription produced two interrelated
effects: [**it transformed the population\'s political and civil
liberties into life forms that were to be safeguarded by the state
rather than acted on by the citizenry; more importantly, it turned
political opponents of this biopolitical settlement into potential
enemies of the ways of life that the state safeguards.**]{.underline}

## Disease

Of course, *Rx* was made for popular audiences in the U.S. and so in its
populist format, some may argue, it is more likely to reproduce these
kinds of stereotypes than other more professional or expert discourses.
This does not mean, however, that other medical discourses are devoid of
these problematic \"othering\" stereotypes. [All [discourses]{.mark}

observes, the conflation of foreigners and \"immigrants\" with germs has
been apparent since the emergence of \"[[germ
theory]{.mark}\"]{.underline} in the late 1800s: a theory which was
compounded by the emergence of immunology and virology in the twentieth
century.^36^ This theory, and its more modern incarnations,
[[represents]{.mark} germs---or]{.underline}, more belatedly,
[[viruses]{.underline}---**[as \"foreign,\" \"dangerous,\"
\"contagious,\" and a threat to the \"pristine,]{.underline}**

itself is commonly figured as \"the \'virgin\' land of the new
world]{.underline}.\"^37^ [Scientific discourses associated with
HIV/AIDS]{.underline}---such as immunology and epidemiology---[offer
recent examples of the way these constructions continue to be
reproduced. Immunologic discourses frequently deploy a language of
**\"foreignness and invasion\"**]{.underline} in their accounts of HIV
infection.^38^ Emily Martin cites one popular textbook that describes
the process of \"foreign antigen recognition\" as the \"human body\'s
police force\" being \"programmed to distinguish between *bona fide*

Haitians or sub-Saharan Africans---[as \"risk groups]{.mark}.\" The near
consensus among AIDS immunologists and epidemiologists that Africa is
the primary site of HIV also **powerfully reinstalls the link** between
foreignness and contagion]{.underline}. Whether latent or manifest,
[[**such exclusionary \"othering\" and racist stereotypes keep being

Although I like the implications of Haraway\'s and Martin\'s analyses,
an examination of immune system discourses is incomplete without a
complementary appraisal of the immune system\'s most formidable
non-self: the virus. The self/non-self dichotomy has been so extensively
explored by historians and mined of its last glitter of insight by
theoreticians that we might easily be tempted to dismiss its continued
operation in our everyday lives as the tailings from an abandoned
excavation. Such dismissal would be a mistake. Society still deploys
binarisms in blatant disregard of decades of sound, decisive
scholarship. Debates about national and personal boundaries are
unfolding within our anxious apprehensions of an approaching viral
pandemic. [The virus emerges as a dangerous foreign being]{.underline}:

[unknowable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [native]{.underline} lurking in that
dark, unknowable continent, [**[waiting to erode our identity and leave
us degenerated]{.mark}** or reborn]{.underline}. Marlow or Tarzan, the
Westerner who makes contact with the indefinable essence of Africa has
always emerged a transformed soul. The only postmodern element of virus
discourse is that now the African transformative being has become a
global passenger with no need for a green card. [**[Virus
discourse]{.mark}** is **[retell]{.mark}**ing old **[imperialist
nightmares that]{.mark}**, neutralized under cover of medical common
sense, seem to **[justify exclusionary practices, surveillance,
and]{.mark}** general **[prejudice]{.mark}** that we would otherwise
find inexcusable as well as politically untenable.]{.underline} Like the
Soviets in the 1980s, **[[viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the 1990s
[[**have** **become**]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [reliable
**[villains]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some now credit them as the cause of
an impressive array of hitherto orphaned ailments, from cancer to
dementia. 12 [The most striking evidence of viruses\' current sway over
some people\'s imagination appears in the attenuation of the perceived
menace from global warming, nuclear holocaust, starvation,
disease]{.underline}, and so forth[, and the growing perception of viral
epidemics as the only source of danger.]{.underline} This is a striking
change from as recently as 1977, when officials in Close Encounters of
the Third Kind, brainstorming for a convincing lie to frighten all the
locals out of the Devil\'s Tower area, reject an apocryphal virus
epidemic in favor of a chemical spill. Simultaneously, the field of
potential victims shrinks to humanity alone. This frequently occurs in
virology articles, at the levels of both syntax and concept. For the
syntax, notice how Richard Krause, senior scientific advisor at the
Fogarty International Center, NIH, slips between \"viruses\" and
\"microbes\": \"The light of science must be focused on those forces
that propel the emergence and migration of virus diseases. These events
stem from attributes of microbes.\" 13 There are many types of microbes,
of which viruses are only one. In the same essay, Krause uses the term
emerging viruses interchangeably with epidemics and plagues, even though
much of his discussion focuses on bacterial diseases. Stephen Morse
makes the same shift: \"Officials of all kinds . . . need to be aware of
the infectious-disease implications of ecological and demographic
changes. These are \'signals\' for viral traffic.\" 14 Robert Shope and
Alfred Evans, epidemiologists at Yale, similarly alternate in an
unspecified manner between \"host\" and \"human\" in their discussion of
viral evolution; at some points they are clearly discussing other animal
hosts, but that use continually bleeds into a \"host\" that means only
\"human host.\" 15 Joshua Lederberg offers a conceptual example of the
same narrowed focus: \"[A few vermin aside, Homo sapiens has undisputed
dominion \--and we could]{.underline}, where we choose, even [eradicate
rodent and insect pests]{.underline}\" (although he allows that we might
suffer a bit from the pesticides); \"[bacterial and protozoan
parasites\" will soon be eliminated]{.underline}, too\--thus, \"[our
only real competitors remain the viruses]{.underline}.\" 16 Lederberg
has exterminated every single living threat from the global playing
field. [This anticipates the eradication of all our pests]{.underline}
more than prematurely\--even assuming that such eradication were a
sensible goal\--[and]{.underline} entirely [elides the hazard that our
species poses to itself]{.underline}. More ominously, notice how
Lederberg has framed the relationship between humans and other organic
beings to include only predator-prey interactions; [anything that we
cannot kill is ipso facto a competitor]{.underline}.

#### Their advantage is an imperialist construction used to legitimize colonization under the mantle of economic liberalism

[**Lipschutz '95** \[Professor of Politics at UC Santa Cruz, On
Security, pg 15-17)]{.underline}

Consider, then, [the consequences of the intersection of security policy
and economics during and after the Cold War. [In order to establish a
"secure" global system, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[advocated]{.mark}, and put into place, a global system of [economic
liberalism]{.mark}. It then underwrote, with dollars and other aid, the
growth of this system.4]{.underline}~3~ One consequence, of this project
was the globalizations of a particular mode of production and
accumulation, which relied on the re-creation, throughout the world, of
the domestic political and economic environment and preferences of the
United States. [That such a project cannot be accomplished under
conditions of really-existing capitalism is not important: the idea was
that economic and political [liberalism would reproduce the American
self around the world]{.mark}.44 [This would make the world safe]{.mark}
and secure for the Untited States inasmuch as it would all be the self,
so to speak.]{.underline} The joker in this particular deck was that
efforts to reproduce some version of American society abroad, [in order
[to make the world]{.mark} more [secure]{.mark} for Americans, [came to
threaten the cultures and societies]{.mark} of the countries [being
transformed]{.mark}, making their citizens less secure. [The
process]{.mark} thereby [transformed them into the very enemies we
feared]{.mark} so greatly]{.underline}. In Iran, for example, the Shah's
efforts to create a Westernized society engendered so much domestic
resistance that not only did it bring down his empire but so, for a
time, seemed to pose a mortal threat to the American Empire based on
Persian Gulf oil. Islamic "fundamentalism," now characterized by some as
the enemy that will replace Communism, seems to be U.S. policymakers'
worst nightmares made real,~45~ although without the United States to
interfere in the Middle East and elsewhere, the Islamic movements might
never have acquired the domestic power they now have in those countries
and regions that seem so essential to American "security." [[The ways in
which the framing of threats is influenced by a changing global economy
is seen nowhere more clearly than in recent debates over competitiveness
and "economic security]{.underline}.]{.mark}" What does it mean to be
competitive? Is a national industrial policy consistent with global
economic liberalization? [How is the security component]{.underline} of
this issue [socially constructed]{.underline}? Beverly Crawford (Chapter
6: "Hawks, Doves, but no Owls: The New Security Dilemma Under
International Economic Interdependence") shows how strategic economic
interdependence -- a consequence of the growing liberalization of the
global economic system, the increasing availability of advanced
technologies through commercial markets, and the ever-increasing
velocity of the product cycle -- undermines the ability of states to
control those technologies that, it is often argued, are critical to
economic strength and military might. Not only can others acquire these
technologies, they might also seek to restrict access to them. Both
contingencies could be threatening. (Note, however, that by and large
the only such restrictions that *have* been imposed in recent years have
all come at the behest of the United States, which is most fearful of
its supposed vulnerability in this respect.) What, then, is the solution
to this "new security dilemma," as Crawford has stylzed it? [How can a
state generate the conditions for legitimizing various forms of
intervention into this process?]{.underline} Clearly, it is not enough
to invoke the mantra of "competitiveness"; competition *with* someone is
also critical. In Europe, notwithstanding budgetary stringencies, state
sponsorship of cutting-edge technological R&D retains a certain, albeit
declining, legitimacy in the United States, absent a persuasive threat,
this is much less the case (although the discourse of the Clinton
Administration suggests that such ideological restraints could be
broken). Thus, [[it is the hyperrealism]{.underline}]{.mark} of Clyde
Prestowitz, Karel Van Wolferen, and Michael Crichton, [[imagining a
Japan resurgent]{.mark} and [bent]{.mark} anew [on
]{.mark}]{.underline}(non) Pacific [[conquest, that provides the
cultural materials for new]{.mark} economic [policies. Can new]{.mark}
industrialized [enemies be conjured into existence]{.mark} so as [to
justify new cold wars and the remobilization of capital, under state
direction,]{.mark} that must follow]{.underline}? Or has the world
changed too much for this to happen again?

#### Securitized economic predictions result in violent interventionism---this pre-emptionary logic has empirically has killed tens of millions of people in the name of capital accumulation. 

[**Neocleous '8** (Mark, Prof. of Government at Brunel, Critique of
Security, AM)]{.underline}

In other words, the new international order moved very quickly to
reassert the connection between economic and national security: the
commitment to the former was simultaneously a commitment to the latter,
and vice versa. [As the doctrine of national security was being born,
the major player on the international stage would aim to use perhaps its
most important power of all -- its economic strength -- in order to
re-order the world]{.underline}. And this [[re-ordering was conducted
through the idea of 'economic security']{.underline}]{.mark}.99 Despite
the fact that 'econ omic security' would never be formally deﬁned beyond
'economic order' or 'economic well-being',100 [[the]{.mark}]{.underline}
signiﬁcant [conceptual [consistency between economic security and
liberal order-building also had a strategic ideological role]{.mark}.
[By playing on notions of '**economic well-being'**]{.mark}, [economic
security seemed to emphasise]{.mark} economic and thus '[human' needs
over military ones]{.mark}. [The]{.mark} reshaping of global capital,
international order and the [exercise of]{.mark} state [power
could]{.mark} thus [look]{.mark} decidedly [liberal and
'humanitarian']{.mark}. [This appearance]{.mark} **[helped co-opt
the]{.mark} liberal [Left into the process]{.mark}** and]{.underline},
of course, [played on individual desire for personal security by using
notions such as 'personal freedom' and'social equality']{.underline}.101
Marx and Engels once highlighted the historical role of the bour geoisie
in shaping the world according to its own interests. The need of a
constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over
the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle
everywhere, establish connections everywhere . . . It compels all
nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of
production; it compels them . . . to become bourgeois in themselves. In
one word, it creates a world after its own image.102 In the second half
of the twentieth century this ability to 'batter down all Chinese walls'
would still rest heavily on the logic of capital, but would also come
about in part under the guise of security. [The whole world became a
garden to be cultivated]{.underline} -- [to be recast according to the
logic of security.]{.underline} In the space of ﬁfteen years [the
concept '[economic security' had moved from]{.mark} connoting [insurance
policies]{.mark} for working people [**to** **the desire to shape the
world**]{.mark} in a capitalist fashion]{.underline} -- and back again.
In fact, it has constantly shifted between these registers ever since,
being used for the constant reshaping of world order and resulting in a
comprehensive level of intervention and policing all over the globe.
[Global order has come to be fabricated and administered according to a
security doctrine underpinned by the logic of capital
accumulation]{.underline} and a bourgeois conception of order. By
incorporating within it a particular vision of economic order, the
concept of national security implies the interrelatedness of so many
different social, econ omic, political and military factors that more or
less any development anywhere can be said to impact on liberal order in
general and America's core interests in particular. Not only could
bourgeois Europe be recast around the regime of capital, but so too
could the whole international order as capital not only nestled, settled
and established connections, but also'secured' everywhere. [[Security
politics]{.mark} thereby [became the basis of]{.mark} a distinctly
liberal philosophy [of global 'intervention']{.mark}, [fusing]{.mark}
global issues of [economic management with]{.mark} [domestic policy
formations]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [an ambitious and]{.mark} frequently
**[violent strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Here lies the Janus-faced
character of American foreign policy.103 [One face is the 'good]{.mark}
liberal [cop':]{.mark} friendly, prosperous and democratic, sending
money and help around the globe when problems emerge]{.underline}, so
that the world's nations are shown how they can alleviate their misery
and perhaps even enjoy some prosperity[. [The]{.mark} [other]{.mark}
face [is the 'bad]{.mark} liberal [cop']{.mark}: should one of these
nations decide]{.underline}, either through parliamentary procedure,
demands for self-determination or violent revolution [to address its own
social problems in ways that conﬂict with the interests of capital and
the bourgeois concept of liberty, then]{.underline} the authoritarian
dimension of liberalism shows its face; **[[the 'liberal moment' becomes
the moment of violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This Janus-faced
character has meant that through the mandate of security the US, as [the
national security state par excellence, has seen ﬁt to either overtly or
covertly re-order the affairs of myriads of nations -- those 'rogue' or
'outlaw' states on the 'wrong side of history']{.underline}.104
'Extrapolating the ﬁgures as best we can', [[one CIA agent
commented]{.mark} in 1991,'[there have been about 3,000 major covert
operations]{.mark} and over 10,000 minor operations]{.underline} --
[[all]{.mark} illegal, and all designed to disrupt, destabilize, or
modify the activities of other countries']{.underline}, adding that
'**[every covert operation has been [rationalized in terms of]{.mark}
U.S. national [security']{.mark}]{.underline}**.105 These would include
'interventions' in Greece, Italy, France, Turkey, Macedonia, the
Ukraine, Cambodia, Indonesia, China, Korea, Burma, Vietnam, Thailand,
Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Cuba, the
Dominican Republic, Uruguay, Bolivia, Grenada, Paraguay, Nicaragua, El
Salvador, the Philippines, Honduras, Haiti, Venezuela, Panama, Angola,
Ghana, Congo, South Africa, Albania, Lebanon, Grenada, Libya, Somalia,
Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and many more, and many of these more
than once. Next up are the '60 or more' countries identiﬁed as the bases
of 'terror cells' by Bush in a speech on 1 June 2002.106 The methods
used have varied: most popular has been the favoured technique of
liberal security -- 'making the economy scream' via controls,
interventions and the imposition of neo-liberal regulations. But a wide
range of other techniques have been used: terror bombing; subversion;
rigging elections; the use of the CIA's 'Health Alteration Committee'
whose mandate was to 'incapacitate' foreign ofﬁcials;
drug-trafﬁcking;107 and the sponsorship of terror groups,
counterinsurgency agencies, death squads. Unsurprisingly, some plain old
fascist groups and parties have been co-opted into the project, from the
attempt at reviving the remnants of the Nazi collaborationist Vlasov
Army for use against the USSR to the use of fascist forces to undermine
democratically elected governments, such as in Chile; indeed, [one of
the reasons fascism ﬂowed into Latin America was because of the ideology
of national security]{.underline}.108 Concomitantly, '[national
security' has meant a policy of non-intervention where satisfactory
'security partnerships' could be established with certain authoritarian
and military regimes:]{.underline} Spain under Franco, the Greek junta,
Chile, Iraq, Iran, Korea, Indonesia, Cambodia, Taiwan, South Vietnam,
the Philippines, Turkey, the ﬁve Central Asian republics that emerged
with the break-up of the USSR, and China. Either way, [[the whole world
was to be included in the new'secure']{.mark} [global liberal order.
**The result has been the slaughter of** ]{.mark}**untold
numbers.**]{.underline} John Stock well, who was part of [a CIA project
in Angola which led to the deaths of over 20,000 people]{.underline},
puts it like this: [Coming to grips with these U.S./CIA activities in
broad numbers and ﬁguring out how many people have been killed in the
jungles of Laos or the hills of Nicaragua is very difﬁcult]{.underline}.
[But, adding them up as best we can, we come up with a ﬁgure **of [six
million people]{.mark} killed**]{.underline} -- **[[and this is a
minimum ﬁgure]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Included are: one million killed
in the Korean War, two million killed in the Vietnam War, 800,000 killed
in Indonesia, one million in Cambodia, 20,000 killed in Angola -- the
operation I was part of -- and 22,000 killed in Nicaragua.109 [Note that
the six million is a minimum ﬁgure, that he omits to mention rather a
lot of other interventions, and that he was writing in
1991]{.underline}. This is security as the slaughter bench of history.
All of this has been more than conﬁrmed by events in the twentyﬁrst
century: in a speech on 1 June 2002, which became the basis of the
ofﬁcial National Security Strategy of the United Statesin September of
that year, President Bush reiterated that the US has a unilateral right
to overthrow any government in the world, and launched a new round of
slaughtering to prove it. While much has been made about the supposedly
'new' doctrine of preemption in the early twenty-ﬁrst century, [the
policy of preemption has a long history as part of national security
doctrine]{.underline}. The United States has long maintained the option
of pre-emptive actions to counter a sufﬁcient threat to our national
security. [The greater the threat, the greater is the risk of
inaction]{.underline} -- and the more compelling the case for taking
anticipatory action to defend ourselves . . . To forestall or prevent
such hostile acts by our adver saries, the United States will, if
necessary, act pre emptively.110 In other words, [**[the security policy
of the world's only superpower]{.mark}**]{.underline} in its current
'war on terror' [**[is]{.mark}** still **[underpinned]{.mark} [by a
notion of liberal order-building based on]{.mark} a certain vision of
'[economic order']{.mark}.**]{.underline} The National Security Strategy
concerns itself with a 'single sustainable model for national success'
based on 'political and economic liberty', with whole sections devoted
to the security beneﬁts of 'economic liberty', and the beneﬁts to
liberty of the security strategy proposed.111 [[Economic
security]{.mark}]{.underline} (that is, 'capitalist accumulation') [in
the guise of 'national security' [is now used as the justiﬁcation for
all kinds of 'intervention',]{.mark}]{.underline} still conducted where
necessary in alliance with fascists, gangsters and drug cartels, and the
proliferation of 'national security' type regimes has been the result.
So while the national security state was in one sense a structural
bi-product of the US's place in global capitalism, it was also vital to
the fabrication of an international order founded on the power of
capital. National security, in effect, became the perfect strategic tool
for landscaping the human garden.112 This was to also have huge domestic
consequences, as the idea of con tainment would also come to reshape the
American social order, helping fabricate a security apparatus intimately
bound up with national identity and thus the politics of loyalty.

### 2NC Economy---Epistemology Indict

#### Economics as a science fails---their predictions are useless

[**Bergmann '5** (Barbara, Professor Emerita of Economics at Maryland

[**More than two hundred years have passed since the publication of The
Wealth of Nations, yet [we are]{.mark} still** [far from **having a
science**]{.mark} **[we can rely on to prevent major malfunctions of the
economy]{.mark} or to treat them when they do occur. A nation\'s econ
omy is a difficult entity to study. Yet the inherent difficulty of the
subject matter is not the only problem. [The study of the economy has
not developed as have other sciences]{.mark}, in which direct
observation and data collection by the scientists them selves play a
large part.** [Most members of the economics profession study and cre
ate economic theory that is neither inspired nor validated by
observation]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is little direct engagement by
economists with people, businesses, banks, markets; little inquiry as to
who does what and why; little observing at firsthand of any actual
economic functioning.1 There are exceptions: a relatively small segment
of the profession is doing hands-on research on the way people behave
when faced with eco nomic decisions. However, they are only in the
earliest stages of developing a body of knowledge that could inform
economic policy making. And only a handful have yet ventured out of the
laboratory, where observations are made on students play ing the part of
the economic actors, to go into the field, where the behavior of real
economic actors going about their business is to be seen[**. [One
indication]{.mark} of the poor state of development of economics [is
the]{.mark} well-known and much ridiculed [lack of agreement]{.mark}
[among]{.mark} professional [economists]{.mark} [on policy with regard
to]{.mark} such vital [issues as unemployment, budget deficits, taxes,
inflation]{.mark}, international [trade]{.mark}, the promotion of
[growth, and]{.mark} the government [regulation]{.mark} of business.
What is even more disturbing than the lack of agreement is the fact that
[political ideology]{.mark} quite** obviously [determines]{.mark}
**[which side of any controversy about economic theory]{.mark} or
economic policy [any]{.mark} particular [economist is likely to
take]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The invasion of scientific argument by
nonscientific considerations?sympa thies for particular groups,
attachment to certain extrascientific beliefs or value judgments?is not
totally unheard of in the physical sciences, but there its effect,
unlike the situation in economics, is minor. A few professional
biologists of some eminence are fundamentalist Christians who reject the
theory of evolution. But the factual evidence for evolution is so
overwhelming that their numbers remain tiny, and their influence on
ongoing research and theorizing among biologists is nil. In economics,
on the other hand, [**[evidence that has]{.mark} so far [been
collected]{.mark} [on]{.mark} most of [the important issues is
scarce]{.mark}, indirect, difficult to interpret, and not well suited to
provide answers that would settle the controversies.** [This is
particularly true]{.mark} [in macroeconomics]{.mark}, **[which deals
with]{.mark} such issues as [unemployment, inflation, and foreign
trade]{.mark}. As a result, evidence is seldom decisive in winning
adherents to a particular view of any economic issue.**]{.underline} The
failure of appeals to evidence to settle controversies decisively and
the pervasive influence of ideology combine to allow great freedom to
the formulators of economic theory. Without fear of contradiction, at
least from the faction to which they belong, economists can and do
purvey far-fetched notions to considerable acclaim, some of which are
referred to below. Material gain and career advancement also come into
play Any particular eco nomic policy holds the possibility of adding to
the income and wealth of some peo ple and subtracting from the income
and wealth of others**[. [Politicians]{.mark} beholden to particular
groups in the population [can pick and choose among economists. This
gives an incentive for economists to divide themselves]{.mark} into two
camps, so that whichever party comes to power will have a ready-made
corps of economists will ing and ready [to recommend policies congenial
to the party\'s constituency]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Again, the effect
of material interests on views of natural scientists is not unheard of.
Measures to fight global warming are expensive, and the industries
affected by such measures and the politicians they support will find
scientists who will help them to resist. Yet scientists are assiduous
collectors of facts in a way that economists so far have not been, so
that in the natural sciences factual evidence is more plentiful, more
directly applicable to the issues, and clearer. Eventually, it is
evidence that determines the outcome of any controversy.
