As NATO members meet in Madrid, there [are two main challenges that
alliance members will have to contend with]{.underline}. [The first is
continued isolationism and retrenchment in the U.S.]{.underline} amongst
both Democrat and Republican lawmakers, including former President
Trump. Washington is increasingly keen to pivot its resources to the
Indo-Pacific and its strategic competition with China. As such, the U.S.
is eager to see European member states spend more on their own defence
to be able to rapidly respond to their security threats should U.S.
leadership be absent or directed elsewhere. Defence spending amongst
alliance members is increasing, and while Germany's Zeitenwende or
'turning point' marks a notable shift in German defence policy, there is
the risk of it being a cosmetic rather than a practical watershed, with
tangible results likely years away. Support for an increase in German
defence spending remains stubbornly low, with notable resistance coming
from Chancellor Scholz's own Social Democrats as well as other coalition
members.

In addition, [the cost-of-living crisis, economic, and energy security
factors are likely to test European member states' support for Ukraine
as the autumn and winter loom. This has already divided NATO member
states between those who wish to see a full Russian
withdrawal]{.underline} and for Ukraine to regain control of the
entirety of its territory, [versus those who think Kyiv should accept a
peace settlement]{.underline} with Russia to avert further bloodshed and
economic pain in Europe. Poland, the Baltic states, the US, and the UK
fall into the first camp, whilst France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and
several others fall into the second. [The alliance may now be formally
united in recognizing the scale of the threat from Russia, but it is not
united as to the degree that that threat should trump individual member
states' economic and security needs. 'Ukraine fatigue' is already
setting in]{.underline} and it looks likely to increase as the months
drag on, something that Moscow is all too eager to exploit.

### No impact uniqueness - China Low Priority

#### China low on the priority list -- Strategic Concept clearly makes it a low priority

**Pavel 22** \[Barry, Senior Vice President and Director, Scowcroft
Center for Strategy and Security, "Scowcroft strategy scorecard: NATO's
Strategic Concept clear on threats, but will require sustained
commitment from Alliance," 07/07/22,
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/scorecard/scowcroft-strategy-scorecard-natos-strategic-concept/>,
accessed 07/12/22, GDI-JCR\]

[The new Strategic Concept]{.underline} contains a bit more continuity
in many of its elements with the 2010 version than had been expected.
While accounting for the dramatically different security
environment---and, for example, pointing to an enhanced force posture to
address it---there was not really a clear theme, concept, or label. The
strategic context section [is solid, capturing the Russian threat very
well]{.underline} ("the Euro-Atlantic area is not at peace") [and the
"systemic challenges" posed by China]{.underline}, for example.
[However, I was startled that the China section was so low on the
priority list, coming after humanitarian and other challenges, and that
the threat of terrorism was so high]{.underline} (coming immediately
after Russia). It also would have been good to have seen a bit of
foresight applied, with some projections of where the security
environment might be headed.

### No implementation -- funding 

#### The Strategic Concept success or failure depends on implementation -- and lack of sustained budget support cannot support its massive vision

**Scheunemann 22** \[Leah, Deputy Director, Transatlantic Security
Initiative at the Atlantic Council, "Scowcroft strategy scorecard:
NATO's Strategic Concept clear on threats, but will require sustained
commitment from Alliance," 07/07/22,
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/scorecard/scowcroft-strategy-scorecard-natos-strategic-concept/>,
accessed 07/12/22, GDI-JCR\]

Again, [one has to view the Strategic Concept as a top-level
strategy]{.underline} that paves the way for continued adaptation at all
levels of the Alliance. I do think the [Strategic Concept will provide
the top cover needed for leaders in key areas to advance necessary
adaptations, specifically on deterrence and defense,]{.underline} where
there is a need for NATO to accelerate its good steps taken since the
Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. [The devil will really be in the
details of implementation, only some of which we have seen so far with
the vague announcements of the new force model and new regional
plans]{.underline} discussed at the summit that would require thousands
of more ready troops assigned to NATO [without an articulation of how
readiness will be bolstered]{.underline} especially [without all
countries meeting a defense spending minimum, let alone going above and
beyond the notorious 2 percent metric.]{.underline} Realistic
implementation guidelines Is it feasible to implement this strategy? Are
there resources available to sustain it? [NATO has agreed to a historic
new strategy]{.underline} at a time of war on the European continent [at
a scale not seen since World War II.]{.underline} I have great
confidence in the many leaders at NATO and throughout the Alliance's
member states to continue to advance and accelerate the changes the
Alliance has made since 2014 to address the renewed threat of a
revisionist Russia, while also tackling new challenges that exacerbate
global insecurity with greater vigor. What [I am]{.underline} more
[pessimistic about]{.underline} is [NATO's ability to sustain upward
pressure on defense budgets to implement this very expensive vision and
continue to safeguard collective security.]{.underline}

### No Tradeoff -- China

#### No tradeoff between bolstering security cooperation in Europe and NATO's strategic recognition of China

**Geist & Donfried 22** \[Radovan, Publisher of Euractiv.sk & HEMA
enthusiast, Karen, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and
Eurasian Affairs, "US official: No trade-off between European and
Indo-Pacific security," 07/11/22,
<https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence-and-security/interview/us-official-no-trade-off-between-european-and-indo-pacific-security/>,
accessed 07/12/22, GDI-JCR\]

[NATO's new strategy is not about the alliance shifting its attention
toward the Indo-Pacific, but instead that there is a need to acknowledge
and address China's increased strategic influence in
Europe]{.underline}, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and
Eurasian Affairs, Karen Donfried told EURACTIV Slovakia in an interview.
Karen Donfried is US Assistant Secretary of State for European and
Eurasian Affairs in the Biden administration. Before her current
position, she served as president of the German Marshall Fund (GMF) of
the United States. [The United States announced at the NATO Madrid
Summit in June that they are strengthening its military presence in
Europe. Does it mean they will have to revise their plans
for]{.underline} extended presence in [the Indo-Pacific? I don't think
there's a trade-off between security in Europe and security in the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} In fact, one of the striking aspects of the
NATO summit in Madrid was that not only did the thirty NATO allies come
together, but also, for the first time, we had four leaders from the
Asia-Pacific attending the summit. [The message was not about NATO going
to Indo-Pacific, but that China has in many ways come to
Europe]{.underline} through Belt and Road by buying strategic
infrastructure in Europe, [so NATO needs to have a holistic view of this
situation.]{.underline} And it was very beneficial to have those four
leaders there and help us in the alliance better understand China's
challenge.

### Impact Turn - China Pivot Leads to War

#### US provocations over Taiwan will only be possible with NATO pivot to Asia -- leads to nuclear war

**Haiphong 22** \[Danny, independent journalist & weekly contributor to
the Black Agenda Report, "Taiwan and the making of an 'Asian' NATO,"
<https://mronline.org/2022/07/09/taiwan-and-the-making-of-an-asian-nato/>,
accessed 07/13/22, GDI-JCR\]

Still, [NATO's decision to shift attention on the Pacific is a clear and
present threat to world peace.]{.underline} Even the Washington
Post-owned Foreign Policy magazine has warned of a "Global Cold War"
arising out of NATO's interest in China. The U.S. government, Northrup
Grumman-funded Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has
admitted that [NATO is returning to a "Cold War posture."]{.underline} A
better term for the strategy is full-spectrum dominance. [The alliances
that the U.S. is attempting to build in the Pacific are nothing more
than an extension of a decade-long militaristic posture toward China
which has brought more than half of the U.S.'s military arsenal to the
region.]{.underline} This brings the question of Taiwan into view. It's
clear to anyone paying attention that the U.S. views Taiwan as the
single most important flashpoint for its military strategy against
China. U.S. President Joe Biden has already approved four different
weapons transfers to Taiwan over the course of eighteen months. Biden
has also verbalized on three different occasions that his administration
is committed to defending the island from a so-called invasion from
China. These moves are dangerous violations of the status quo on the
Taiwan question established during the tumultuous latter stages of the
Cold War. The recognition of the People's Republic of China by the
United Nations in 1971 and the normalization of relations between the
U.S. and China in 1979 affirmed Taiwan as a Chinese province under the
One-China principle. However, the United States under successive
administrations has moved away from the status quo by providing clear
political support to separatist forces in legislation such as the Taipei
Act which advocates for Taiwan's participation within prominent
international bodies. Furthermore, the United States has increased arm
sales to Taiwan in violation of Article 6 of the 1982 Joint Communiqué
between China and the U.S. which states: Having in mind the foregoing
statements of both sides, the United States Government states that it
does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan,
that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or
in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since
the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and
China, and that it intends gradually to reduce its sale of arms to
Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution. To get a
picture of just how much the U.S. has violated this clause, the U.S.
maintains a backlog of weapons transfers to Taiwan worth \$14 billion
and this number is only set to grow with the announcement of \$120
million more in assistance to Taiwan's naval forces earlier this month.
Taiwan is intimately connected to the U.S.'s overall strategy of
developing a NATO-like infrastructure in the Pacific. U.S. military
strategists and talking heads have become obsessed with likening Ukraine
to Taiwan. Their argument is that Russia's special military operation in
Ukraine means that the U.S. must escalate in Taiwan to protect the
island from China. The problem with this formulation is two-fold.
Ukraine is a sovereign country. Taiwan is a province of China. Where the
parallel truly resides is that similar to Ukraine being used as a pawn
to forward the NATO encirclement of Russia, Taiwan is being used as a
chip in the U.S.'s plans to militarily encircle China. A key country to
watch following the NATO summit is Japan. Japan's former Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe pre-empted the NATO summit by stating that China should be
forced to "give up seizing Taiwan." Japan currently stations more than
120 U.S. military bases and has already made a commitment to increase
military spending in a show of loyalty to the U.S.'s anti-China
geopolitical strategy. With South Korea's election of a new pro-U.S.
president and Australia's adoption of a hostile policy toward China, the
U.S. will likely seek firmer commitments from its so-called allies on
the question of Taiwan. [The U.S. sees in the Taiwan question both a
profitable venture for its defense industry and an opportunity to build
the case for war with China.]{.underline} But [the U.S.'s legitimacy is
on the decline and China's prestige in Asia, the Pacific, and the rest
of the world is on the rise. The U.S. doesn't merely seek alliances; it
needs them. Military encirclement and the host of aggressive policies
that the U.S. employs against China cannot succeed in isolation, if they
can succeed at all.]{.underline} The U.S. understands that any conflict
with China over Taiwan would require a level of support in the region
similar to the servitude demonstrated by Europe against Russia. Such a
pursuit is incredibly reckless for a host of reasons. First, China
presents no tangible military threat and in fact makes peace a
fundamental priority in the international arena. China has only a single
military base abroad and has not participated in a military conflict in
more than four decades. Furthermore, [while China seeks peaceful
resolution to the issue of reunification with Taiwan, it will not
tolerate any attempt by the U.S. to engineer independence or
separatism.]{.underline} So-called [Taiwan "independence" is China's
red-line]{.underline}, just as Russia's red-line was NATO expansion into
Ukraine and beyond. [The U.S.'s provocations in Taiwan thus risk a hot
war with China that would inevitably lead to nuclear exchange. A hot war
with China would destroy whatever stability exists around the world and
create]{.underline} an [economic and human catastrophe]{.underline} far
greater than what has occurred over the course of Russia's special
military operation in Ukraine. [Those who dismiss these real and
legitimate threats to humanity]{.underline} in favor of Sinophobia,
Yellow Peril, and New Cold War talking points [are walking in lock-step
with the U.S. empire. It is critical that we]{.underline} resist this
reactionary defeatism, [oppose any and all attempts of the U.S. to form
a NATO-like infrastructure in the Pacific]{.underline}, and align
ourselves with all global forces, including China, standing on the side
of self-determination and peace.
