Cyber analysts are pushing the Department of Homeland Security to ramp
up cyber protections for [satellites and other space-based
systems]{.underline}, which they say [are far too vulnerable to hacks
that could upend large parts of the economy.]{.underline} For example:
[A hack that disrupted satellite-assisted navigation could jam up things
from shipping and trucking to farms that rely on precision navigation
tools, wreaking havoc on the economy. "Almost every critical function
\... is dependent on space,"]{.underline} said Sam Visner, a technical
fellow at the MITRE Corp., speaking on a panel focused on cyberthreats
to space that I moderated at the Aspen Security Forum. "[Other countries
see this as an advantage for themselves. ... They see our
vulnerabilities in space and space systems as a way of gaining an
advantage over us amid great power competition." The danger has
escalated as the number of space systems has proliferated]{.underline}
and as more of it is being run by private companies such as Elon Musk's
SpaceX and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin. (Bezos owns The Washington Post).
The IT that run most space systems is complex and requires specialized
knowledge that few hackers have. But those [back-end systems are
increasingly linked]{.underline} (sometimes intentionally) with
commercial front-end systems that hackers are expert at cracking into.
Such [hacks could be launched by criminal gangs that demand a ransom to
unlock them or by adversary nations looking to damage the U.S.
economy.]{.underline} A worst case scenario: [Hackers might disrupt the
command and control of satellites themselves, forcing them to crash into
each other with ripple effects across industry sectors.]{.underline}
