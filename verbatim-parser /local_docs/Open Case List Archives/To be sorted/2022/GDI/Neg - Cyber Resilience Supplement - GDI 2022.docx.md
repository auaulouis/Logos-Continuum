The Alliance's Achievements in Cyber So Far Over the past fifteen years,
[NATO's approach to cyber issues has evolved from addressing cyber
defense in primarily technical terms to viewing it as essen- tial to the
alliance's strategic context]{.underline}. The need to "strengthen
capabilities and to defend against cyber- attacks" was first
acknowledged by allied leaders at their 2002 summit meetings in
Prague.19 However, after Estonia's digital infrastructure was hit by
cyber- attacks in 2007, NATO admitted that a confrontation between
states might involve a cyber dimension, and at the Bucharest Summit in
2008 adopted its first cyber-defense policy. The 2008 conflict between
Russia and Georgia demonstrated that cyberattacks have the potential to
become a major component of conventional warfare. In parallel, the [NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) was accredited
as a NATO Centre of Excellence in 2008.]{.underline} Since then, it has
grown into a strong, international knowledge hub for cyber defense,
bringing together top cyber experts across fields---government,
military, industry, and academia---from 29 nations for interdisciplinary
research, training, and exercises in four focus areas: technology,
strategy, operations, and law. The [center connects]{.underline} a
trusted community of like-minded [states who wish to share information
and expertise in cyber security]{.underline}. CCDCOE's best-known
[projects are Locked Shields]{.underline}, one of the world's largest
and most comprehensive cyber-defense exercises; the [annual cyber
conference CyCon]{.underline}; [and the Tallinn Manual]{.underline},
which looks at cyber operations within the context of international law.
At the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago, allied leaders reaffirmed their
commitment to improving the alliance's cyber defenses by bringing all of
NATO's networks under centralized protection. At the 2014 Wales summit,
NATO recognized that international law applies in cyberspace and
declared that, since the impact of a cyberattack could be as harmful to
modern societies as a conventional attack, cyber defense is a part of
NATO's collective defense mandate. Thus, NATO acknowledged that
cyberspace is an operational domain for potential adversaries. NATO's
2016 Warsaw summit resulted in a decla- ration recognizing that
cyberspace has evolved into a separate domain of military operations, in
which the alliance "must defend itself as effectively as it does in the
air, on land, and at sea." The subsequent roadmap included the drafting
of a NATO cyber operations doctrine, as well as the development of
military cyber capabilities. In January 2020, the Allied Joint Doctrine
for Cyberspace Operations was published "to plan, execute, and assess
cyberspace operations in the context of allied joint operations."20 At
the Warsaw summit, NATO heads of state and government signed a Cyber
Defence Pledge, in which they outlined how nations protect their cyber
networks. NATO developed detailed questionnaires and metrics related to
the pledge and uses them to regularly report on how each nation delivers
on its cyber commitments. Allies also discussed how to strengthen the
cyber component of NATO's Command Structure. [The Command Structure is
the military backbone of the alliance; it is what makes NATO unique.
NATO has continuously adapted its Command Structure over the past
decades to take account of a changing secrity environment.]{.underline}
In February 2018, NATO defense ministers established the Cyberspace
Operations Centre (CyOC) as part of NATO's SHAPE Command Structure, with
the aim of integrating the allies' cyber capabilities into NATO
military-operations planning. [CyOC is the first cyber-dedicated entity
within the Command Structure.]{.underline} The "eyes and ears" of the
respective commanders in cyberspace, [CyOC aims at enhancing situational
awareness in cyberspace and helping integrate cyber into NATO's planning
and operations at all levels. While CyOC operates within the existing
NATO frameworks, its main aim is to equip the Supreme Allied Commander
Europe with any necessary tools to operate in cyberspace]{.underline}.21
As CyOC moves toward initial then final operating capacity, [it will be
critical that it is staffed with suffi- cient---and sufficiently
expert---personnel]{.underline}.22 During NATO's July 2018 summit, the
allies affirmed, for the first time, their determination "to employ the
full range of capabilities, including cyber, to deter, defend against,
and counter the full spec- trum of cyber threats," shifting away from
securing cyberspace with defensive measures only. [The "full range" of
cyber capabilities means that both defensive and offensive capabilities
can be deployed by NATO, in line with its defensive mandate and in
accordance with international law. As NATO will not develop or acquire
any offensive capabilities, it will rely, like in other operational
domains, on the voluntary contribu- tions of allies.]{.underline} In
late 2020, a team of experts appointed by NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg and chaired by Thomas de Maiziere of Germany and Wes
Mitchell of the United States gave their recommendations on how NATO
could enhance its political role and better coor- dinate military tasks
and political strategies among its members. In 2021, Stoltenberg's NATO
2030 included eight of those recommendations to guide the revision of
NATO's Strategic Concept.23 At the Brussels summit in 2021, the allies
endorsed a [new Comprehensive Cyber Defense Policy high- lighting
collaboration as necessary to strong cyber defense, which recognized
that "the impact of signif- icant malicious cumulative cyber activities
might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed
attack.]{.underline}24 A [key feature of the new policy is the prominent
role of offensive cyber operations]{.underline}.25 In Brussels, [member
states committed to "employ the full range of capabilities at all times
to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of
cyber threats."26 In other words, the alliance declared it could respond
to malicious cyber activities below the threshold of use of force
causing significant harm with, among other things, conventional military
or offensive cyberspace operations.]{.underline} NATO has committed to
develop its next Strategic Concept for the 2022 summit. The alliance's
current Strategic Concept dates back to the Lisbon summit in 2010. It is
clearly out of date, having been conceived when terrorism and energy
cut-offs were the major threats and the alliance's primary mission was
to culti- vate partnerships with non-member states rather than to face
aggressive great-power rivals.

### SQuo solves -- international partnerships

#### Squo solves -- US engaged in cyber partnerships under persistent engagement and defend forward

Implications for the Alliance and Intelligence Collection" [Intelligence
and National Security]{.underline} vol 35, 2020 -- Issue 3, Taylor and
Francis Online accessed 7/5/2022 GDI-TM\]

Benefits and the creation of partnerships

[The strategy of persistent engagement and defend forward can help less
capable cyber actors defend themselves against adversaries]{.underline}.
[Both the U.S. Cyber Command vision and the DoD cyber strategy stress
the importance of working closely with international and private sector
partners to successfully operate in cyberspace]{.underline}.xxix The DoD
strategy states the following: "Our strategic approach is based on
mutually reinforcing lines of effort to build a more lethal force;
compete and deter in cyberspace; expand alliances and partnerships;
reform the Department; and cultivate talent."xxx [On international
partnerships, it more explicitly states: "]{.underline}Many of the
United States' [allies and partners possess advanced cyber capabilities
that complement our own.]{.underline} The Department will [work to
strengthen the capacity of these allies and partners and increase DoD's
ability to leverage its partners' unique skills, resources,
capabilities, and perspectives. Information-sharing relationships with
allies and partners will increase the effectiveness of combined
cyberspace operations and enhance our collective cybersecurity
posture.]{.underline}"xxxi

[The United States has also signed several memoranda of understanding
and over the years addressed cyber cooperation in some way, shape or
form. In]{.underline} 2008, a MoU was signed between the Department of
Defense and the German Federal Ministry of Defence about computer
network defense and information assurance.xxxii A year later, a similar
MoU on computer network defense was signed with South-Korea. xxxiii

More recently, the [Cyber Command worked alongside Montenegrin cyber
defenders with as aim "to increase interoperability,]{.underline} build
partner capability, and deter malign influence on the democratic
processes of our allies, partners and the U.S."xxxiv [It was reported
that U.S. Cyber Command personnel operated in the networks of Ukraine
and Macedonia as well to help those countries defend against malicious
cyber activity.]{.underline}xxxv At the 2019 Cyber Command symposium,
specific examples were discussed on how cooperation can also help in not
just detecting or deterring adversaries but also cause friction in their
operational activity.xxxvi For example, the U.S. might upload foreign
APT malware samples on VirusTotal, an online malware repository and file
scanning service, forcing adversaries to go back to the drawing broad
and adapt.xxxvii [One can think of several other scenarios how
international partnerships (also with the private sector) can help to
ensure more coordinated take down of adversarial operations - actions
beneficial to both the US and its partners.]{.underline}

## Cyber 

### Threats overblown -- minor impact 

#### Cyber threats are overblown -- attacks often minor and manageable threats 

**Mueller, 2022**

\[John, Political Scientist at Ohio State University and a Senior Fellow
at the Cato Institute, "The Cyber-Delusion: Digital Threats Are
Manageable, Not Existential", Foreign Affairs, 3/22/22,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-03-22/cyber-delusion,
accessed 7/4/22, GDI-cc\]

[When Russian forces launched their invasion of Ukraine last month,
governments and experts worldwide warned about the danger of
catastrophic cyberattacks]{.underline}. Indeed, in the days leading up
to Moscow's invasion, hackers defaced Ukrainian websites, unleashed
malware on government systems, and targeted the country's banking
system---albeit with limited effect. [Although no cyber-Armageddon has
materialized, officials increasingly fear that Russia might eventually
step up its efforts and even target the United States.]{.underline}

Russia's invasion is no doubt catastrophic[. But in reacting to it and
preparing for what comes next, leaders]{.underline} in Washington and
elsewhere [should eschew the alarmism that has]{.underline} long [warped
cybersecurity policy.]{.underline} Mike Mullen, then chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, claimed in 2011 that "the single biggest
existential threat out there, I think, is cyber." The following year,
his successor, Martin Dempsey, noted that "a cyberattack could stop our
society in its tracks." Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta sternly
warned in 2012 of an impending "digital Pearl Harbor." Nicole Perlroth,
a cybersecurity reporter at The New York Times, has routinely asked
insiders when "a cyber-enabled cataclysmic boom will take us down" and
has always been told "18 to 24 months." She began her survey well over
100 months ago.

[This contemporary approach to cyberthreats resembles the aftermath of
9/11, when almost all experts believed an even larger terrorist attack
would soon take place. Then, as now, the threat is
overblown.]{.underline} Although occasionally dramatic[, cyberattacks
have turned out]{.underline} to be a [comparatively minor and manageable
threat. Far too much discussion around the issue focuses on worst-case
scenarios]{.underline}, [fails to contextualize the problem, and
neglects to weigh the costs of cyberattacks against the enormous value
of the Internet and artificial intelligenc]{.underline}e. [Most
commentary,]{.underline} moreover, [does not fully appreciate the
ability of the business sector]{.underline}---by far the most tempting
of targets for malevolent hackers---[to develop effective
countermeasures.]{.underline}

### Threats overblown -- fixes 

#### Cyber alarmists do not assess longer term impact effectively -- fixes to viruses and hacks

[The achievements of cyber-sabotage]{.underline} have also been quite
[modest.]{.underline} The United States and Israel famously
[used]{.underline} a computer [virus]{.underline} known as
[Stuxnet]{.underline} to [hamper Iran's progress toward developing a
nuclear weapon.]{.underline} Although observers hailed the operation as
a dangerous new development in modern conflict[, the damage proved
temporary]{.underline}. Iran quickly rebuilt its centrifuges, and [the
attack actually proved counterproductive]{.underline}, as it encouraged
Tehran to accelerate its nuclear program. There have also been efforts
by the United States to physically interfere with missile development in
[North Korea.]{.underline} Yet, much like the Iranians, Pyongyang
[eventually solved whatever the problem was, and the attacks had little
long-term effect on their program.]{.underline}

[Cyber-alarmists have also warned about hackers disabling major
infrastructure such as power grids---]{.underline}potentially crippling
entire countries[. Grids do go down occasionally, but the culprits are
typically squirrels and lightning. Regardless of the source, such
disruptions are usually brief and bearable, and engineers are
increasingly designing systems that are resilient to such
threats.]{.underline} Estonia, for instance, the victim of a major and
oft-discussed cyberattack in 2007, is now the home of NATO's Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.

### Threats overblown -- no cyber terrorism

#### Cyberterrorist threats overstated -- no terrorist group has ever launched a successful cyberattack and standard warfare more effective 

**Mueller, 2022**

\[John, Political Scientist at Ohio State University and a Senior Fellow
at the Cato Institute, "The Cyber-Delusion: Digital Threats Are
Manageable, Not Existential", Foreign Affairs, 3/22/22,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-03-22/cyber-delusion,
accessed 7/4/22, GDI-cc\]

[Fears that terrorist groups could inflict damage through cyberspace
have been around for many years. And although cyber played no direct
role in the execution of the 9/11 terrorist, the event stirred anxiety
about the issue.]{.underline} In 2002, for instance, The Washington Post
published a lengthy front-page article conveying the views of
"government experts" that "terrorists are at the threshold of using the
Internet as a direct instrument of bloodshed."

[To date, however, no terrorist group has launched a successful
cyberattack. And even if it becomes possible for hackers to shed blood,
shootings and bombings are likely to accomplish the same goal far more
reliably]{.underline}. Still, cyber has undoubtedly proved to be a
relatively convenient method for terrorist groups to recruit and
communicate. Rather than creating a paradigm shift, however, this
technique has simply replaced or embellished older methods. [Even
comparatively savvy groups such as the Islamic State]{.underline} (also
known as ISIS) [tend to comically fail when using the Internet to stir
up violence and instruct potential sympathizers.]{.underline} In one
case, an ISIS handler connected his eager American charge to a
prospective collaborator who happened to be an FBI operative.

[For the most part, any virtual terrorist army in the United States has,
as terrorism expert Brian Jenkins puts it, remained exactly that:
virtual. "Talking about jihad, boasting of what one will do, and
offering diabolical schemes egging each other on is usually as far as it
goes,"]{.underline} he noted. Indeed, the foolish willingness of
would-be terrorists to describe their aspirations and often-childish
fantasies on the Internet has often helped police seeking to track them
down.

### Threats overblown -- limited cyber crime impact 

#### Cybercrimes are exaggerated -- attacks are remarkably small compared to other forms of illegal activity and businesses are adapting to these threats

**Mueller, 2022**

\[John, Political Scientist at Ohio State University and a Senior Fellow
at the Cato Institute, "The Cyber-Delusion: Digital Threats Are
Manageable, Not Existential", Foreign Affairs, 3/22/22,

accessed 7/4/22, GDI-cc\]

Despite the overheated rhetoric about war, terrorism, election
interference, and critical infrastructure, [most cyberattacks target the
private sector]{.underline}, seeking to steal or extort money from
businesses and their customers. The record here, however, is rather
encouraging, and it likely has broader relevance. To be sure,
cybercriminals have stolen and extorted billions of dollars from
businesses and individuals, but [firms have done well at limiting the
damage by closing software holes, maintaining backups, and safeguarding
sensitive material.]{.underline}

[A central issue for potential hackers is the profitability of their
enterprise.]{.underline} A report by the cybersecurity firm Symantec
estimates that 978 million people were affected by cybercrime in 2017,
losing \$172 billion in total. [That number---regardless of how hackers
divvy up the profits---is actually remarkably small compared to losses
from other forms of illegal activity.]{.underline} Personal and property
crimes in 2017, for instance, cost Americans \$2.6 trillion.

[Businesses are also learning to adapt]{.underline}. Andrew Odlyzko,
former head of the University of Minnesota's Digital Technology Center,
points out that [many firms have realized they can readily mitigate the
most damaging effects of cybercrime through minor and incremental
alterations to their business practices.]{.underline} Banks, for
instance, increasingly require customers to verify large or suspicious
transactions through voice calls or texts. And even though criminals
routinely capture millions of credit card numbers through compromised
databases[, the overall damage is limited and often dominated by the
cost of providing replacement cards.]{.underline} Businesses have also
made it easy for consumers to recover from fraud.

## Deterrence

#### Deterrence failure in Ukraine demonstrates the complexity of deterrence -- multiple actions required to shore up deterrence

GDI-TM\]

[The fact that Russia followed through with its threatened invasion of
Ukraine demonstrates that NATO and the wider West's deterrence strategy
was no longer fit for purpose]{.underline}. Looking ahead, [deterrence
must be approached more comprehensively, with policymakers recognizing
that it extends far beyond the battlefield.]{.underline}

BRUSSELS -- As NATO military chiefs meet in Brussels to discuss the war
in Ukraine, the other issue on their minds is the alliance's forthcoming
Strategic Concept, which will shape its priorities for years to come.
And here, [Russia's behavior has demonstrated that re-establishing
deterrence must play a central role.]{.underline}

When Russia began amassing troops on Ukraine's border late last year, it
embarked on a path of aggression against not just Ukraine but also what
it calls the "collective West," particularly the European Union and
NATO[. Russia was seeking to deter Ukraine and the West from increased
collaboration, while the West was seeking to deter Russia from
aggression. The subsequent invasion stems from a massive failure of
deterrence.]{.underline}

The Ukrainians have marshalled an impressive defense, and the EU, NATO,
and other Western partners and allies have continued to tighten economic
and financial sanctions and provide aid. But we are in a dangerous cycle
of escalation. [The situation demands credible deterrence that goes far
beyond the traditional "nuclear umbrella."]{.underline}

After all, [deterrence is not only about nuclear warfare]{.underline}.
It is relevant to all forms of confrontation -- whether in business or
on the battlefield. [Many of these dynamics are present in the current
conflict. Russia and Europe's codependent energy relationship had been
deemed a strong deterrent on both sides; but it patently
failed.]{.underline}

[Deterrence is about convincing an opponent that not doing something is
in its best interests]{.underline}. Russia first attempted to deter
Ukraine and the West by deploying its troops along Ukraine's borders.
But as it did, the [United States and its NATO allies released daily
intelligence and data]{.underline} revealing Russian troop movements,
demonstrating clearly to the Kremlin that they knew what it was doing.
[Such signaling is the first element of deterrence.]{.underline}

[Another core element of deterrence is the belief that an adversary has
both the will and the capability to escalate measures if the other side
does not change course.]{.underline} When Russia issued a litany of
demands designed to highlight Ukraine and NATO's vulnerabilities -- from
Ukraine's status as a state to the overall European security
architecture -- its audience didn't find its threats to be credible.

[With the exception of the US, few believed that Russia would launch a
full-scale invasion or persist with its threats against NATO and neutral
states. Yet Russia did invade and has since issued veiled nuclear
threats and even tested a new supersonic missile.]{.underline}

Similarly, Russian President Vladimir Putin did not take seriously
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and
other Western leaders when they expressed their intentions to support
Ukraine. The Kremlin heard these statements, but it also heard several
other leaders, including US President Joe Biden, say that they would not
send troops to defend a non-NATO country. Russia thus decided to invade,
only to be surprised by the scope and intensity of the West's response.

For its part, [Ukraine's deterrence strategy was essentially to project
an image of itself as a country that already belonged to the
West.]{.underline} And though the Kremlin was unpersuaded, [Russia
clearly underestimated Ukrainian unity and the capability and competence
of its army]{.underline}, even though it had been fighting Ukrainian
forces since its incursions into the country in 2014.

Ukraine's heroic self-defense reminds us that beyond the battlefield and
business, beyond sanctions and institutions, there are ordinary people:
the war is taking place among them, and they will decide its ultimate
outcome. Though Ukrainians' will to defend their lives, homes, and
ideals has not yet deterred Russia's leadership, there is strong
evidence that it has deterred many Russian soldiers from fighting.

Looking ahead, [Western deterrence must become a primary strategic
objective and thus more comprehensive, including all the elements that
matter]{.underline}. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd [Austin took a step
in this direction by announcing that one of America's goals now is to
"see Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things
that it has done in invading Ukraine]{.underline}." And the \$33 billion
lend-lease bill that Biden signed on May 9 will further advance this
goal.

But it's not enough. [Deterrence must be a popular aim that commands
widespread public support. It also must be backed by other countries,
because international cooperation is crucial for ensuring the security
of smaller, vulnerable states.]{.underline} Achieving such broad-based
support requires effective, inspirational leadership of the kind that
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has demonstrated. He has rallied
not only the Ukrainian people but the entire Western world. Other
leaders would do well to follow his example.

[Finally, it is important to remember where deterrence fits in the
broader context of globalization. Russia was emboldened by the economic
interdependencies that it has cultivated, and it was empowered by its
status as a permanent, veto-wielding member of the United Nations
Security Council. Deterrence must include measures either to neutralize
or contain both factors.]{.underline}

The war in Ukraine is the result of insufficient deterrence. Ultimately,
there will be no peace without it.

## Hybrid War 

### AT: hybrid war bad 

#### Hybrid war obsession overblown -- and cyber limited impact on hybrid war -- small impact on warfighting and disinformation 

**Mueller, 2022**

\[John, Political Scientist at Ohio State University and a Senior Fellow
at the Cato Institute, "The Cyber-Delusion: Digital Threats Are
Manageable, Not Existential", Foreign Affairs, 3/22/22,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-03-22/cyber-delusion,
accessed 7/4/22, GDI-cc\]

Over the past decade, [the global obsession with digital
threats]{.underline} has taken various forms, with a particular [focus
on the potential military implications of emerging
cyber-capabilities.]{.underline} To be sure, the [military
needs]{.underline} to worry about keeping [its communications and
command and control operations secure]{.underline} from hostile
attackers. [Any disruptions, however, are more likely to be instrumental
or tactical than strategic.]{.underline}

Despite statements to the contrary, the U.S. military itself seems to
have recognized this reality. When Panetta proclaimed in 2013 that cyber
was "without question, the battlefield for the future," political
scientist Micah Zenko observed at the time that the Pentagon was
spending less than one percent of its budget on cybersecurity, and an
assessment from 2019 suggests it may be more like one-tenth of one
percent. If those funds prove adequate for the challenge, it would be
something of a bargain.

[Cyber]{.underline} also [supposedly enhances a state's ability to carry
out such ancient endeavors as espionage, propaganda dissemination, and
sabotage. Analysts have even coined a new term, "hybrid
warfare]{.underline}," that usually includes these three
enterprises---a[lthough, since the term does not include direct armed
conflict]{.underline}, it might [more plausibly be called "denatured
warfare]{.underline}." **[Cyber's contribution to these three
areas]{.underline}**, however, **[is relatively limited.]{.underline}**

[Should invading hackers engage in digital espionage against the United
States, for instance, they are likely to find that most of what they
come across is already well known]{.underline}, and that much of the
rest is not worth knowing in the first place. [Wikileaks']{.underline}
2010 publication of thousands of classified U.S. government documents
[demonstrated]{.underline} the degree to which [governments]{.underline}
worldwide [have fallen victim to over-classification. When]{.underline}
Bill Keller, the editor in charge of poring over the documents at The
[New York Times, was asked whether]{.underline} the reporting team
[found anything they didn't already know]{.underline}, he [responded
"no" without hesitation.]{.underline}

[Much the same holds for concerns over]{.underline} the [theft of
intellectual property]{.underline}. Not only is this practice centuries
old, but [systematic stealing has often proved unwise because it
distracts governments from homegrown innovation. Cyber-propaganda
efforts]{.underline}, in turn, are more likely to [increase
the]{.underline} overall a[mount of]{.underline} available information
and [disinformation]{.underline}---an age-old problem in warfare[---than
to provide a decisive advantage.]{.underline}

leap opens the door to doubling deployments.]{.underline} The current
battle groups are made up of between 1,000 and 1,600 soldiers. A brigade
could be at least twice that number. The Norwegian added that [the heads
of state and government will agree to increase NATO\'s rapid response
force in case of conflict to \"more than 300,000″ soldiers,]{.underline}
i.e. more than eight times its current number. \"[The goal is to send

#### SQ solves -- NATO increasing troop presence to demonstrate preparation to protect from Russia

[There is little more palpable evidence of what the invasion of Ukraine
has meant in the geostrategic sphere]{.underline} - and its prolegomenon
of the annexation of Crimea in 2014 - [than the Strategic
Concept]{.underline} that NATO approved 12 years ago. In that document,
which sets out the alliance\'s strategy for the next decade, Russia
appeared as a \"partner\" of the Alliance. In the one to be [approved in
Madrid, the aggressive neighbor to the far east of Europe will be
defined as \"the most significant and direct threat to
security,\"]{.underline} Stoltenberg explained.

[To deal with that threat, the organization, with strong U.S.
leadership, is prepared to take steps unthinkable]{.underline} last
January, just weeks [before Putin\'s war in Ukraine began.]{.underline}
[Now the organization has deployed in the eastern countries]{.underline}
(Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and
Bulgaria) most of the 40,000 troops it has under its command, some
25,000 soldiers, according to its own figures. [And Stoltenberg has
announced that this deployment will go further by announcing this move
from battalions to brigades.]{.underline}

\"The increased presence from battalions to brigades will be in some
countries. This does not apply to all. There are different needs for
each country,\" the secretary general clarified, after pointing out that
between February and now, [NATO has already doubled the number of
battalions in the east, from four to eight.]{.underline}

[Most of Stoltenberg\'s appearance was aimed at putting on the table the
effort that NATO is prepared to make to protect itself from the former
partner that has now become an enemy]{.underline}. And that effort
involves putting more money on the table. Because the war and its
preparations, even if it is only to scare it away, require many millions
of dollars and euros. Here he has warned that the commitment remains
that reached in 2014 at the Wales Summit: to raise to 2% of GDP the
spending of the 30 allied States: \"It is a floor, not a ceiling\". In
other words, it is the minimum spending required by the organization.

### Squo solves cyber -- Ukraine proves 

#### Russia ineptness and Ukraine resiliency undermine effective cyber -- multiple examples

So far, [experts who have watched the Russian cyber assaults have been
confused at their lack of success]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline}
the [lower]{.underline} [tempo]{.underline}, [intensity and
sophistication of what Russian-government hackers are known to be
capable of]{.underline}.

[Ukrainian defences have proved resilient]{.underline}, [said one
European official]{.underline} who was briefed this week by the
Americans at a Nato meeting, [and Russian offences have proved
mediocre]{.underline}. He said the reason was that, so far, [Russia has
held back its elite corps in the cyber arena]{.underline}, [much as it
has on the battlefield]{.underline}, [perhaps by underestimating the
Ukrainians]{.underline}.

[One example]{.underline}, he said, [was]{.underline} the fact that
[instead of communicating solely through encrypted military-grade
phones]{.underline}, [Russian]{.underline} [commanders are sometimes
piggybacking on Ukrainian cell phone networks to
communicate]{.underline}, at times simply by using their Russian cell
phones.

"The Ukrainians love it --- there is so much data in simply watching
these phones, whether or not they are using encrypted apps," he said.

The [Ukrainians then block Russian phones from their local networks at
key moments]{.underline}, further [jamming their
communications]{.underline}. "Then you suddenly see Russian soldiers
grabbing cell phones off Ukrainians on the street, raiding repair shops
for sims," he said. "[This is not sophisticated stuff. It's quite
puzzling]{.underline}."

During his decade and a half at the Pentagon, Christopher [Skaluba

falter]{.underline} for months, he has a new message for defense
planners: "[Every single one of those assessments]{.underline} that I've

[Across NATO, defense planners are reassessing Moscow's military
might]{.underline} in their contingency plans in the unlikely event of a
conventional war between the alliance and Russia, according to multiple
current and former U.S. and European defense officials. The
reassessments come after Moscow's embarrassing military setbacks in
Ukraine, as well as the Kremlin's willingness to launch a full-fledged
military invasion in the first place.

There are [two major assumptions]{.underline} that [defense planners
in]{.underline} major [NATO capitals got wrong for years,]{.underline}
former NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in an interview
with Foreign Policy. First, Rasmussen said, "we have [overestimated the
strength of the Russian military.]{.underline}

[Despite huge investments in military equipment and the reopening of old
Soviet bases, we have seen a very weak Russian military." "The other
miscalculation is we have underestimated the brutality and the ambitions
of]{.underline} President \[Vladimir\] [Putin]{.underline}," Rasmussen
added.

Now, in capitals in Europe and North America, [wonks in defense
ministries]{.underline} are [dusting off years-old assessments of the
Russian military's fighting prowess and starting to question long-held
assumptions]{.underline} on what a conventional war between NATO members
and Russia would look like.

preparedness]{.underline}, there's a [bunch of factors]{.underline} that
[have added up to something that you just wouldn't expect to see from an
advanced military,"]{.underline} Skaluba said of the Russian forces,

# Solvency Answers 

## Arms Control -- Cyber 

### 1NC -- International cyber arms control fails 

#### Cyber arms control agreement fail -- laundry list 

**Benincasa, 2021**

\[Eugenio, WSD-Handa Resident Fellow at Pacific Forum in Honolulu, \"The
Case for Cyber 'Disarmament' in the European Union\", Italian Journal of
International Affairs, Vol. 56, Issue 1, 2021, LexisNexis, accessed
7/2/22, GDI-cc\]

The last two decades of [multilateral dialogue]{.underline} on state
behaviour in cyberspace have thus  been [unable to establish clear rules
and standards for cyber operations, raising concern  about an arms race
in cyberspace.]{.underline} Influential experts such as Richard Clarke,
former  Special Advisor on cybersecurity to President George W. Bush,
have explicitly called for  creation of a cyber arms control regime
(Bronk and Wallach 2013). In 2015, The  New York Times (2015) supported
the idea of an arms control treaty in cyberspace,  stating that "the
best way forward is to accelerate international efforts to negotiate
limits on the cyber arms race, akin to the arms-control treaties of the
Cold War". Nonetheless,  this possibility will have to be assessed in
light of the inherently unique nature of the  cyber domain.

[Most of the multilateral arms control agreements]{.underline} were
negotiated with the aim of  limiting specific type of arms and their
geographical proliferation, in some cases leading  to their total and
effective ban. After the end of the Cold War and the waning of the 
bipolar system, it soon became clear that arms control had to be
implemented in other  areas besides nuclear power, such as biological
and chemical weapons. To establish  universal frameworks to reduce such
threats, [consensus among major global players  was deemed essential. In
the context of cyberspace, today's global players differ not only  in
their strategic interests, but also in their conceptual frameworks of
what constitutes  cyberspace. While there is no universal definition of
a cyber weapon,]{.underline} it can be described  as a computer program
designed to compromise the integrity or availability of data in an 
enemy's ICT system for military purposes (Perkovich and Levite 2017).
Importantly,  weaponry and non-weaponry malicious software look very
similar in terms of their  technical components. They require both an
'exploit' and a 'payload' in order to function.  An exploit is a program
or a piece of code that, while not malicious in itself, takes  advantage
of a security flaw in an application or system -- a so-called
'vulnerability' -- that  allows an intruder to access a network remotely
(Herr 2014). A software vulnerability  that is previously unknown is
called 'zero day', due to the fact that the vendor has literally  zero
days to fix it. The payload contains the actual attack component, that
is, the  malicious code targeting and tailored to a specific ICT system
with the aim of causing  damage. The effects of the payload can range
from surveillance and data exfiltration to  actual physical damage. Zero
days can be thought of as the 'ammunition' of cyber  weapons and the
payload as their 'trigger'.

[Bringing all relevant parties together -- including non-state actors --
to agree on a shared conceptual framework of cyberspace for the purpose
of arms control does not seem to be a realistic or sustainable objective
for the time being.]{.underline} Additionally, even if the
above-mentioned conceptual disparities were to be solved, a [cyber arms
control regime based on traditional arms control treaties would be hard
to enforce because of some inherent characteristics of cyberspace and
their implications]{.underline} for the purposes of arms control. More
specifically:

● [Assessing relative strength: In order to negotiate an agreement that
can promote stability by effectively imposing restrictions upon the
development, production, stockpiling and usage of certain types of
weapons, states need to have an under- standing of each other's relative
strength]{.underline}. As explained by Erica Borghard and Shawn Lonergan
(2018), "for conventional munitions, nuclear weapons, or even chemical
ordinances, warheads or pounds of a virulent gas that a state possesses
can be counted, allowing others to assess comparative strength. The same
cannot be said for assessing relative strength in cyberspace". [Virtual
weapons cannot be counted and, once produced, can be easily duplicated
and transmitted to other locations at no cost via different
means]{.underline}, such as email, websites, instant messaging,
peer-to-peer sharing, etc (Denning 2001). "To copy a cyber weapon, all
you have to do is see it, because the weapon itself is made of
information" (Hitchens 2019[). These circum- stances make cyber strength
assessment unfeasible.]{.underline} In contrast, the technical skills of
cyber threat actors may be easier to measure than virtual weapons
(Borghard and Lonergan 2018), but [negotiating and enforcing an
agreement imposing skill-based restrictions would add other
complexities. Barring the skills used to craft cyber weapons would be
equivalent to prohibiting "how-to" information, or "making advanced
mathematics illegal]{.underline}" (Libicki 2009, 199[): in other words,
impossible.]{.underline} The impact of such an approach would not be
desirable either, [given that the skills needed to craft offensive cyber
tools are also used by law-abiding actors to build defences]{.underline}
and by [intelligence agencies to conduct cyber espionage]{.underline},
an activity in which everyone has a stake (Ibid.).

● [Verification of compliance: The mutual verification mechanisms needed
to ensure that all parties abide by the agreed terms is quite an
intrusive process]{.underline}, and [states are wary of sharing
sensitive national security information with external actors --
especially adver- saries]{.underline}. [Within a cyber arms control
framework, compliance verification would require states to have access
to each other's networks]{.underline} -- public, private and classified
-- and scan them to find potential threats (Denning 2001). [This is an
unimaginable scenario for several reasons.]{.underline} Not only would
"such access \[. . .\] provide an external party with critical
information about vulnerabilities and potential exploits, and
potentially violate the agreement it is attempting to enforce", it would
also raise questions about the inherent differences between a monitoring
compliance process and espionage activity (Borghard and Lonergan 2018).
[China and Russia have already dismissed the possibility of accepting
the more limited level of intrusion proposed by the Budapest Convention
for cybercrime cooperation. It is therefore unthinkable that they, or
any other state, would agree to the systematic and routine level of
intrusion into their systems that would be required by a potential cyber
arms control regime.]{.underline} In addition, even if states were to
agree to a similar approach, unearthing hidden virtual threats would be
an onerous task due to the vastness and complexity of network systems,
and to the fact that cyber weapons can be duplicated instantaneously and
sent to other locations at no cost (Denning 2001).

● [Enforcement: Charging states with violating arms control treaty
obligations can be a challenging endeavour in the cyber
domain]{.underline}. In the aftermath of a cyberattack, offenders are
often difficult to identify and prosecute due to the problem of
attribution and the lack of unfettered access to individual state
jurisdictions in order to investigate transnational cyber offences.
States' disagreement over [the reach and scope of extra- territorial
searches into their networks for investigative purposes]{.underline} was
one of the main objections to the cybercrime cooperation model put
forward by the Budapest Convention, and its [perceived violation of the
principle of state sovereignty]{.underline} remains one of the main
ideological differences among major global players. [As for attribution,
research has shown that the lack of effective attribution can contribute
to freeing parties of their responsibilities if they think they cannot
be caught, thus not deterring non-compliance]{.underline} (Barbieri et
al. 2018[). In fact, even if technical attribution]{.underline} -- the
identification and localisation of the source node which initiated the
attack -- [can be achieved, human attribution -- the identification of
the actual actor responsible for the cyberattack]{.underline} -- can be
much harder, given the complexity of a group's affiliation or
involvement in cyber operations. In addition, attribution has to be
communicated effectively to convince the other parties to the treaty
that a violation has actually taken place, but states are often
reluctant to show proof for fear of disclosing classified forensic
methods and sources (Nye 2016/17). Last but not least, [these tasks have
to be carried out in a timely manner after a cyberattack.]{.underline}
Yet, especially in the case of attacks involving corruption as opposed
to disruption, "there may be a significant time lag between when a
derogation occurs and when it is actually observed. Thus, the deterrent
effect of a response is likely to be diluted by the simple passage of
time" (Borghard and Lonergan 2018).

● [Trust: Arms control treaties can be helpful in slowing down a
dangerous arms race between adversaries and building the foundations for
enhanced trust]{.underline}. Nevertheless, US relations with China and
Russia are at an all-time low, and are characterised by deep mistrust
and rising tensions that are unlikely to abate in the foreseeable
future. Moscow's interference in the 2016 and 2020 US presidential
elections (Goldman et al. 2020), as well as the annexation of Crimea in
2014 and its involvement in Syria and Venezuela in stark opposition to
US interests have shaped adversarial dynamics between the two countries
(US Department of State 2020). The US-China relationship has
deteriorated even more dramatically as the two states have been
dismantling decades of political, economic and social cooperation,
heading towards a new era of confrontation driven by Beijing's
increasing ambition to become the next hegemonic power (Wong and Myers
2020). [In the context of cyberspace, these geopolitical knots translate
into the different ideologies and strategic interests analysed
previously, making cooperation and the building of trust increasingly
less likely.]{.underline}

### Extension -- no international agreement 

#### No cyber arms control agreement -- too many obstacles 

**Benincasa, 2021**

Case for Cyber 'Disarmament' in the European Union\", Italian Journal of

[The entanglement of geopolitical and technical difficulties makes it
hard to believe that a cyber arms control agreement will be achieved in
the foreseeable future]{.underline}. This does not mean that it will
never happen: states may eventually reconcile their differences, and
technical problems related to attribution may finally be solved.
Relevant organisations such as RAND, the Atlantic Council and the
Microsoft Corporation have proposed different models for the creation of
an international attribution organisation to meet these challenges
(Mueller 2017). However[, no sweeping change in cybersecurity global
governance should be expected to take place any time soon, including the
negotiation of a cyber arms control agreement.]{.underline}
Nevertheless, while the concept of arms control itself should not be
abandoned, it could be looked at from a different perspective, stepping
out of the box created by Cold War frame- works. In addressing this
issue, Martin Libicki (2009, 199) has asserted that "a good deal depends
on what one means by arms control. If the model were to be something
like the treaties signed between the United States-NATO and the Soviet
Union-Warsaw Pact, which limited certain classes of weapons and banned
others, there is little basis for hope".

\*ev also says to maintain advantage of cyber arsenal needs labor
foundation highly trained

accessed 7/1/22, GDI-cc\]

The abovementioned incidents have led cyber-conflict scholars to point
to [several technical and practical difficulties in the operational
integration of cyber effects.]{.underline}29 In the interviews and
background conversations that contributed to this study[, three of these
difficulties were continuously reiterated when discussing successful
integration of cyber effects into NATO operational planning: the
temporal dimen- sion of developing exploits; the assessment of battle
damage; and the problem of confliction.]{.underline}

Developing exploits---a matter of time

[One of the characteristics of cyber attacks that receives most
attention is the fact that they hit suddenly and without
warning]{.underline}.30 While this is often the case, [the central
question for operational integration is not the speed at which they hit
their target, but the speed with which the tools and techniques that
exploit IT vulnerabilities in order to deliver cyber effects can be
developed.]{.underline} Like conven- tional weapons, [the cyber
tools---the exploits or cyber weapons---take time to
develop.]{.underline} However[, an exploit is often harder to reuse than
a conventional weapon, as it is more dependent on a meticulous analysis
and target preparation---in this case, specifically, the target's IT
infrastructure]{.underline}. [Without knowing the adversary's IT systems
and its vulnerabilities better than the adversary itself, meaningful
cyber weapons are impossible to develop.]{.underline}

[The fact that knowledge about the target is linked not only to the
deployment of a weapon but also to its development influences the extent
to which it can be used and reused]{.underline}. Stuxnet, for example,
required years of development, testing and perfecting before it could
deliver the intended effect on the Iranian centrifuges. Despite the
techniques used in the Stuxnet malware having been found in other
malware,31 Stuxnet lost its ability to destroy the centrifuges when it
was discov- ered and the IT vulnerabilities that enabled it were
patched. Importantly, part of the complexity of Stuxnet relates to the
US--Israeli intention to keep the effect secret[. In a hot conflict,
secrecy in terms of the effect is often less important, and thus the
development and deployment of cyber effects do not necessarily have to
be as complex and time-consuming.]{.underline}

This observation does not necessarily change the fact that the
[development of exploits often has to precede the military confrontation
in which they are intended to be used.]{.underline} [NATO states that
want to deliver cyber effects in NATO operations must try to gain access
to Russia's or other potential adversaries' critical military networks
to identify and exploit IT vulnerabilities.]{.underline} As several
informants empha- sized, if states wait for a conflict to escalate
before they begin the development of exploits, it is most likely to be
already too late.32

The [alternative to penetrating adversary networks in peacetime is for
states to rely on the exploitation of vulnerabilities in as many
commercial off-the-shelf products as possible. This can be
done]{.underline}, for example, [by purchasing exploits from private
companies offering this service, in the hope that it will then be
possible to quickly create an overview of the enemy's IT infrastructure
and adapt the exploits to this environment when a conflict
escalates.]{.underline} [The latter approach is more likely to succeed
against adversaries with low network security, which does not apply in
the case of Russia, or in contexts where less sophisticated and less
closely targeted cyber effects are required.]{.underline}

[Whether member states develop sophisticated exploits for future
targeted effects or stockpile well-known exploits to cause more minor
effects, they cannot]{.underline}---as several informants
indicated---[be certain that they will be able to deliver the cyber
effect at the specific time it is requested by CYOC]{.underline}. [This
is because the IT vulnerabilities upon which exploits depend might not
exist for ever.]{.underline} Cyberspace is a dynamic environment:
vulnerabilities are patched, systems are updated or replaced and bad IT
security practices are identified and improved. This means that
[exploits are temporary in nature and cannot be stored for later
use.]{.underline}33 [States must constantly ensure that the exploits
still work, which requires minor adjust- ments when updates take
place]{.underline}. As a consequence, [the larger the military 'cyber
arsenal', the more technically skilled human resources are needed for
its mainte- nance. In the current labour market, where recruitment and
retention of a cyber workforce is difficult, extensive investment is
required for states to be able to stand ready with cyber effects
available when requested.]{.underline}

In short**[, if a state is to offer a cyber effect in a NATO operation,
then the state is likely to have to be able, first, to predict what
Russian IT systems it is going to target months or years in advance, and
second, to marshal the necessary resources to develop and maintain a
large array of exploits that can be used against these systems. Even if
this is successfully done, the state still faces difficulty in ensuring
that an effect is delivered as promised.]{.underline}**

[NATO's founding purpose was to maintain a sufficient military strength
to deter aggression and attempts at coercion, to prepare for the
eventuality of deterrence failing, and to ensure stability]{.underline}
among European powers.51 During the Cold War, the debates over NATO
deterrence posture largely centred on the role of nuclear weapons, and
specifically whether the United States would retaliate with these
weapons in the event of a Soviet conventional attack against allied
states.52 In short, NATO deterrence was about credibly extending the US
nuclear (as well as conventional force) deterrence to allies to
discourage a Soviet military offensive into eastern Europe.

[While NATO and its member states adapted to the new security environ-
ment]{.underline} after the end of the Cold War by scaling down the
military investments and presence in eastern Europe and by focusing more
on crisis management,53 [much of the]{.underline} Cold War [deterrence
language returned]{.underline} when the Russian--Ukrai- nian conflict
broke out [in 2014]{.underline}.54 [What needs to be deterred today,
much of the literature agrees, is not only a full-scale military
invasion but to a larger extent the use and support of pro-Russian
militant separatists who are willing to apply insurgency
tactics]{.underline} in NATO's post-Soviet member states.55 As a
result[, the allies' military investments have been increasing
agai]{.underline}n,56 a number of initiatives such as the Enhanced
Forward Presence in the Baltic States and Poland have been introduced,57
and the discussions---and disagreements---on the nuclear deterrence (of
non-nuclear threats) have re-emerged.[58 Such responses are often
presented as a renewed attempt by NATO to reassert its deterrence and
assurance posture by signalling strength, preparedness and willingness
to punish 'bad' behaviour.]{.underline}59 [At first sight, the
introduction of CYOC seems to add to these deterrence
efforts]{.underline}. [NATO added an offensive cyber option to reinforce
its ability to impose costs sufficient to dissuade adversaries from
acting aggressively. On closer exami- nation, however, it is not
self-evident that requesting member states' delivery of offensive cyber
effects in NATO operations constitutes a necessary or even a substantial
addition to credibly signalling the ability and willingness to punish an
adversary.]{.underline} NATO's conventional capabilities are clearly
already far superior to Russia's---with or without fully integrated
cyber effects. Thus[, a deterrence failure, resulting for example in a
scenario in one of the Baltic states similar to that which occurred in
eastern Ukraine, will not be the result of NATO's lack of available
cyber tools in its military toolbox; rather, if the Russian leadership
were to consider it in its interest to pursue such a scenario, it would
mean that Russia's decision-makers did not believe in the credibility of
NATO's article 5 or in NATO's ability to mobilize its forces. **The
capacity to integrate cyber effects would do nothing to change
that.**]{.underline}

This section has pointed to [three characteristics about cyberspace that
limit the integration of cyber effects in NATO operations.]{.underline}
[In a complex and constantly changing cyberspace, it continues to be
difficult to develop and maintain sophis- ticated exploits for targeted
cyber effects.]{.underline} This is [especially]{.underline} the case
[if the cyber effects are requested for a specific time and
place]{.underline} in order [to guarantee operational]{.underline}
[success]{.underline}, [and if they simultaneously have to be verifiable
and conform to interna- tional legal principles.]{.underline} [Neither
the member states]{.underline}, which face an internal dilemma between
attack, intelligence collection and defence in cyberspace, [nor the NATO
commander]{.underline}, who will prefer to control the capabilities
used, are [likely to feel suffi- ciently confident about the targeted or
highly integrated cyber effects to choose that option if other
capabilities are available.]{.underline}

#### Multiple incentives for NATO states to resist request based model to contribute to cyber effects

Confliction---the issue of secrecy

The [third challenge to the integration of cyber effects in NATO
operations relates to a well-known military concept,
deconfliction]{.underline}. [The coordination by allies and military
units of their efforts to avoid confliction]{.underline}, between for
example an air operation and a special forces operation in the same
area, is a central element in every military campaign. [Deconfliction is
all about openness and communica- tion between allied partners. But in
cyberspace, deconfliction comes with several difficulties]{.underline}.
At the core of these difficulties is the fact that **[the tools and
techniques that produce cyber effects---which are often also used and
heavily depended on for intelligence collection---are developed in
secret and must stay secret until the effect is achieved.]{.underline}**
[If the IT vulnerabilities and exploits are known]{.underline}, vendors
or adversaries [can fix or replace]{.underline} the software and thereby
[render the effect impossible to achieve]{.underline}.39 **[In an
alliance not known for sufficient mutual trust among members to share
intelligence,40 there is little indication that allies will become more
open about the cyber tools and techniques they currently have at their
disposal.]{.underline}** **[The request-based model is the result of
that lack of trust]{.underline}**. **[And the unwillingness to share
cyber intelligence seriously challenges NATO's ambition to use CYOC to
facilitate information-sharing to increase situational awareness and
thereby achieve the 'cyber readiness' and 'cyber resiliency' that NATO
Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoană hopes to attain]{.underline}**.41

Furthermore, [lack of coordination and discussion about the use of
military cyber capabilities, both internally in each state and among
allies, can have negative implications for intelligence activities and
general network security.]{.underline} A conventional military decision
to deliver cyber effects is rarely concerned with maintaining access and
staying secret after an effect is achieved. [Even though it is customary
to try to obscure the vulnerabilities that are being exploited, it is
difficult to ensure that those operating the targeted system or
third-party network analysts do not identify and fix the vulnerabilities
in, for example, commercial products used all over the
world.]{.underline} [Thus, military plans to engage other state entities
need to weigh the benefit of delivering cyber effects against the risk
of losing intel- ligence capacity, as well as the risk that other
actors]{.underline} (allies, corporations, adver- saries, criminals,
etc.) [will use the same exploits against oneself. In other words, there
is a conflict of interest between attack, intelligence collection and
internal defence in each NATO member state.42]{.underline} The desire of
the US Cyber Command to become more independent from the National
Security Agency (NSA) is precisely an attempt to gain a stronger voice
when the US government assesses whether a vulnerability should be
disclosed to vendors, retained for intelligence purposes or used to
deliver 'loud' cyber effects.43

The risk of [confliction among allies]{.underline} [arises]{.underline}
from the fact that a [similar assessment procedure does not exist across
NATO.]{.underline} [As conversations with several national
representatives at the CDC reveal, such a procedure is unlikely to be
agreed upon owing to the different perspectives on offence, defence and
espionage in cyberspace currently prevailing among member
states]{.underline}.44 [If the Netherlands, for example, offers to
deliver a 'loud' cyber effect in a NATO operation, British or American
intelligence operations could end up being disturbed because they rely
on the same vulnerabilities which---when used in military
operations---risk being exposed and subsequently fixed]{.underline}.45
[When deploying 'loud' cyber effects, malicious actors]{.underline} such
as criminals are also [given the opportunity to identify and exploit the
same vulnerabilities in unpatched systems in allied
countries.]{.underline} The ransomware incidents known as WannaCry and
NotPetya are examples of the damage that can emerge from government
exploits becoming publicly available---even though the specific
vulnerabilities were already patched by Microsoft and updates released
to supported systems.46

[In short, there is a dilemma both internally, between intelligence
agencies and the military, and externally, between allies. While it is
difficult to do much about the latter, the internal power dynamics in
most states, with the intelligence agencies as the primary cyber actors,
are likely to limit the willingness of most states to deliver military
cyber effects---whether offensive or defensive---when CYOC makes
requests. They also limit the willingness to share cyber threat infor-
mation across the alliance through CYOC.]{.underline}

#### NATO country cyber effects limited effectiveness -- laundry list of reasons undermines effectiveness versus Russia 

**Jacobsen, 2022**

\[Jeppe, PhD candidate Danish Institute for International Studies and
the University of Southern Denmark and former coordinator of Denmark's
cyber diplomacy in European Union and NATO, \"Cyber Offense in NATO:
challenges and opportunities\", International Affairs, Vol. 97, Issue 3,
May 2021, https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/97/3/703/6205395,
accessed 7/1/22, GDI-cc\]

[How likely is it that the requested cyber effect will be delivered? The
answer to this question is not clear, in respect of either its
preparation or its execution. This is not only because IT
vulnerabilities are constantly discovered and patched; it is also
because of the difficulty of assessing the effects and possible
side-effects of an exploit when navigating and analysing complex IT
infrastructures]{.underline}. In other words, [reconnaissance is
difficult in cyberspace, and so is the containment of
effects]{.underline}. The Russian attempt to use ransomware aimed at
disrupting critical Ukrainian infrastructure in 2017, for example,
succeeded---but simultaneously encrypted computers globally, causing
substantial economic damage to multina- tional businesses such as Maersk
and FedEx.34

[Collateral damage and unintended consequences are serious issues for
NATO.]{.underline} The alliance takes pride in its adherence to the
principles laid out in international law, such as proportionality and
discrimination, as former NATO Deputy Assis- tant Secretary-General
Jamie Shea has emphasized.35 Thus, [disruptions of servers with huge
negative implications for civilians, or the use of generic cyber tools
that risk spreading their effects far and wide, are most likely not
going to be considered for use in NATO operations. I]{.underline}ndeed,
one of the main challenges to US efforts to disrupt servers in working
against ISIS was finding ways to ensure that civilians were not hit by
their cyber effects.36

[Another aspect of the difficulty of assessing the cyber effect relates
to adver- saries' cyber defence efforts. For the more sophisticated
players in cyberspace, cyber defence has developed into more than simply
patching, clearing and updating systems]{.underline}. [Cyber defence is
also increasingly about following an intruder's activity in one's own
network and creating 'honeypots' or 'honeynets'; or about following data
traffic back to the intruder's network.]{.underline} In short, [cyber
defence is also about deception and active defence.3]{.underline}7 This
approach to cyber defence offers valuable insights into the intruder's
techniques and strategies; but the [mere knowledge that deception is
becoming a predominant defensive strategy also introduces doubts into
the intruder's assessment of possible effects.]{.underline}

[Consequently, as Russia is considered a peer competitor with
considerable cyber-defensive capacities, one informant expressed
scepticism about the extent to which smaller member states are confident
in their ability to deliver a cyber effect when it is requested by
NATO]{.underline}.38 This is especially the case if operational success
depends on a specific effect. [Even if a state has developed the
appropriate exploit, it must also be able to verify that the effect is
achieved and ensure that the effect is contained to minimize collateral
damage.]{.underline} [And even if a state is confident about its current
ability to contain and verify an effect, it must also be confident that
it can deliver, verify and contain the effect at the specific time in
the future when CYOC requests it.]{.underline}

[The process of integration is further complicated by the fact that NATO
must be willing to hand over to contributing states the responsibility
for making battle damage assessments and collateral damage
estimations.]{.underline} As the following subsec- tion shows[, states
are generally unwilling to share classified information about exploits.
Hence, the delegated NATO commander is unlikely to receive much useful
information about how cyber effects are delivered before a decision
about their deployment must be taken. As commanders would prefer to have
control over the capabilities used, member-state cyber effects are
likely choices of method only if alternative, conventional effects are
unavailable.]{.underline}

[The challenges associated with assessing cyber effects are naturally
most signifi- cant in relation to those effects that enable other
kinetic effects that are necessary to achieve operational
success]{.underline}. For [cyber effects that seek to maintain a
persistent annoyance of Russian networks, these challenges are less of
an issue. If the aim is to create confusion and drain resources by
targeting networks and operations that are otherwise difficult and
expensive to disrupt using conventional means, then cyber effects can
support strategic goals without causing irreversible damage to
civilians]{.underline}. As I will conclude at the end of this section,
such [a change demands an adaptation of the way in which CYOC
operates]{.underline}.

### Request based model fails 

#### No internal link -- no consensus definition of cyber weapon and offense in context of NATO even with request based model of cooperation 

**Jacobsen, 2022**

\[Jeppe, PhD candidate Danish Institute for International Studies and
the University of Southern Denmark and former coordinator of Denmark's
cyber diplomacy in European Union and NATO, \"Cyber Offense in NATO:
challenges and opportunities\", International Affairs, Vol. 97, Issue 3,
May 2021, https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/97/3/703/6205395,

During the past decade and a half [there has been a rapid increase
in]{.underline} the scholarly [attentio]{.underline}n [paid
to]{.underline} various aspects of [cyber conflict]{.underline}. [Many
debates have centred on the legally and strategically important task of
providing more clarity to what we mean when we use concepts such as
cyberspace, cyberwar, cyber warfare and cyber attack]{.underline}s[.
Despite the fact that most scholars now agree that it is unproduc- tive
to characterize every cyber intrusion---large or small---as a
cyberwar]{.underline}, [acts of cyber warfare or cyber attacks,10 these
concepts continue to be used in popular and academic discourse to
describe a wide range of phenomena]{.underline}.11 Scholars have there-
fore tried to define and nuance the cyber terminology by adding more
concepts, such as 'cyber weapons' and 'offensive cyber operations' to
focus attention on more military matters.12 Even these attempts have
faced difficulties, however. [There is as yet]{.underline}, for
example[, no consensus on what type of disruption or destruction
(physical, digital or cognitive) a cyber weapon needs to be capable of
creating to count as a weapon]{.underline}.13 [And using the term
'offensive' has just spurred more debate on the blurred distinctions
between offence and (active) defence]{.underline}.1

[The latest suggestion for the appropriate terminology to use when
speaking about the more aggressive military use of cyberspace is
'military cyber effects'---a term that has become especially popular in
the context of NATO operations]{.underline}. Here, [the only way for
NATO to move beyond simply protecting its own networks in its military
operations has been to ask states to deliver cyber effects]{.underline}.
As several conversations with both national and NATO representatives
revealed, [NATO's request-based model is a compromise;]{.underline} [it
is the only possible solution to the fact that member states are
reluctant to hand over specific knowledge about the cyber tools and
techniques they use when delivering cyber effects to an allied
commander]{.underline}.15 Conceptually, [the term 'cyber effects' is
sufficiently vague to encompass all the activities that aim to disrupt,
deny, deceive or destroy an adversary's IT systems]{.underline}. At the
same time, the key reference points in the literature on cyber warfare
offer several good examples of how future cyber effects are currently
imagined. In the rest of this section, I suggest placing these examples
into four categories, thereby laying the foundation for reflection on
the opportunities and challenges associated with integrating these
effects in NATO operations.

## Cyber Operations Centre 

### CYOC Fails 

#### CYOC ineffective -- structural constraints in alliance and CYOC means only info sharing not cyber defense -- deterrence posture invites attacks 

**Jacobsen, 2022**

\[Jeppe, PhD candidate Danish Institute for International Studies and
the University of Southern Denmark and former coordinator of Denmark's
cyber diplomacy in European Union and NATO, \"Cyber Offense in NATO:

accessed 7/1/22, GDI-cc\]

Furthermore[, if the establishment of CYOC is an attempt to signal
defen- sive strength and unity in cyberspace, it remains difficult to
imagine that such signalling would dissuade adversaries from trying to
penetrate NATO and allied systems]{.underline}. [CYOC does not change
the fact that NATO is not tasked to govern and secure national IT
systems.]{.underline} [In an operational setting, states might connect
to each other through so-called federated mission networking;60 but
there is no tradition of ceding control of the deployed national
networks to NATO during military opera- tions]{.underline}. Hence, [CYOC
can only realistically seek to become a hub for cyber-threat
information-sharing and to support states' coordination and
synchronization of various national responses to these
threats]{.underline}. In other words, [CYOC is unlikely to become an
active defender in cyberspace that causes doubt in the adversary's
evaluation of its own cyber capabilities]{.underline}. This also means
that [even if CYOC's coordination and information-sharing efforts manage
to contribute to the denial of intrusions into allied systems, an
adversary's military is unlikely to be deterred from trying to hack
these systems.]{.underline} In fact, **[actively articulating that CYOC
is supposed to deter (through denial) a perceived adversary such as
Russia from hacking NATO and allied operational systems creates an
incentive to do just that and thereby show that the alliance is
incapable of doing what it says it seeks to do]{.underline}**. However,
the renewed [concern about Russia's intentions]{.underline} [in NATO
member states]{.underline} since 2014 is not confined to the need to
deter hostile military invasions or paramilitary activity. It also
[encompasses a range of subversive, non-military activities]{.underline}
that have become available [and]{.underline} are often considered part
of a [broader Russian strategy of 'hybrid warfare']{.underline}.61 Can
CYOC and the integration of cyber effects deter the non-military hybrid
activities that have become possible with the new information and
communication technologies?

#### CYOC fails -- current request based model lack coordination and flexible communication 

**Jacobsen, 2022**

\[Jeppe, PhD candidate Danish Institute for International Studies and
the University of Southern Denmark and former coordinator of Denmark's
cyber diplomacy in European Union and NATO, \"Cyber Offense in NATO:
challenges and opportunities\", International Affairs, Vol. 97, Issue 3,
May 2021, https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/97/3/703/6205395,
accessed 7/1/22, GDI-cc\]

While these challenges are likely to persist[, the cyber effects that
constantly cause temporary annoyances hold a largely unappreciated
potential in military opera- tions.]{.underline} [Even though each of
these effects is unlikely to have a measurable strategic effect on its
own, they stay true to the dynamic cyber environment while being able to
drain resources and cause confusion and doubt]{.underline}. To embrace
this poten- tial fully, [CYOC needs to adopt a more flexible and
open-ended approach when requesting cyber effects]{.underline}. A focus
on highly targeted effects requested at a specific time needs to be
supplemented by more attention to requests that give member states the
freedom to contribute with a variety of (offensive and actively
defensive) effects when they become available. This means, for example,
a willingness from NATO to accept member states' reluctance to share
cyber intelligence and to give up exclusive control over deciding on
potential targets. [To make SCEPVA work, there must be a constant line
of communication between the national cyber units, CYOC and the NATO
commanders to ensure rapid decision-making on whether to use cyber
effects when they become available]{.underline}.

**[If NATO displays this willingness and maintains this line of
communication, the integration of cyber effects will become as effective
as possible for an organiza- tion without close intelligence
cooperation. CYOC, however,---even in its more flexible versions---is
not likely to fulfil NATO's stated ambition to strengthen its broader
deterrence by integrating offensive cyber effects in its
operations.]{.underline}**47 The next section explains why.

## Cyber signaling - nuclear 

### Cyber signaling -- escalation nuclear use 

#### **Ambiguous cyber signaling in nuclear crisis context increases risk of misperception -- even if in conventional conflicts cyber signaling effective** 

**Lonergan and Yarhi-Milo, 2022**

\[Erica, assistant professor in the Army Cyber Institute at West Point,
and Keren, director of the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace
Studies at Columbia University, \"CYBER SIGNALING AND NUCLEAR
DETERRENCE: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE UKRAINE CRISIS\", War on the Rocks,

https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/cyber-signaling-and-nuclear-deterrence-implications-for-the-ukraine-crisis/,
accessed 7/4/22, GDI-cc\]

What are the implications of this for the current Ukraine crisis? Thus
far, [while cyber operations have been used on both sides of the
conflict, they have not played a decisive role on the
battlefield]{.underline}. So far, [the United States has been focused on
providing cyber defense support to Ukraine and NATO,]{.underline}
reportedly to include dispatching Cyber Command's cyber mission teams to
Eastern Europe, as well as seeking to deter potential Russian cyber
retaliation in response to U.S. and Western sanctions, especially
attacks on U.S. critical infrastructure.

[However, if the nuclear dimension of the crisis becomes more acute,
policymakers may be tempted to turn to cyber operations to signal
resolve to deter Russia in the nuclear domain]{.underline}. [Such an
approach could be seen as particularly appealing precisely because cyber
operations are not kinetic and, therefore, less dangerous than other
military moves. But this could have the inverse effect of making nuclear
escalation, rather than deterrence, more likely, for the following
reasons]{.underline}.

In 2020, [Russia clarified its nuclear declaratory policy]{.underline}
to state that Russia [reserves the right to use nuclear
weapons]{.underline} under a range of contingencies, including an
adversary attack against "critical governmental or military sites of the
Russian Federation, disruption of which would undermine nuclear forces'
response actions." Cynthia Roberts has suggested that this particular
scenario ["likely include\[s\] cyber attacks against command and control
infrastructure and/or attempted leadership decapitation]{.underline}."
Similarly, Dmitry Stefanovich wrote that "\[t\]here is a [wide consensus
within the Russian expert community that this also includes possible
cyber threats as well as other non-nuclear dangers]{.underline}."
Interestingly, Russia's declaratory policy contains parallels to the
implicit link between cyber attacks and nuclear use contained in the
2018 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review. That document notes that the United
States would consider using nuclear weapons under "extreme
circumstances," including "significant non-nuclear strategic attacks ...
\[such as\] attacks on U.S. or allied nuclear forces, their command and
control, or warning and attack assessment capabilities."

Therefore, a [hypothetical attempt by the United States to conduct a
cyber operation against Russian nuclear command, control, and
communication systems for signaling purposes, such as to demonstrate
resolve or convey a desire to deter the use of nuclear weapons could in
practice make their use more likely. Unlike most cyber operations, which
rely on secrecy, signals are meant to be seen]{.underline}. And to be
sufficiently credible, [this kind of cyber operation would have to
demonstrate an ability to cause a meaningful effect against Russia's
nuclear systems]{.underline}, rather than a low-cost, unsophisticated
cyber operation. [Therefore, assuming such an attack were feasible, the
chances are greater in this scenario that Russia could interpret U.S.
cyber signals as an attack against its critical military
systems.]{.underline}

[The problem is that, more often than not, cyber operations are
ambiguous signals. There is evidence that states can use cyber
operations under some (narrow) conditions to signal a desire to
de-escalate international crises]{.underline}. But **[these findings do
not extend well to nuclear crises where clarity, rather than
uncertainty, is important for stability]{.underline}**. [The use of
cyber operations to defuse crises have involved cyber signaling short of
war, not during an ongoing conventional conflict involving nuclear
powers]{.underline}. And [they have not involved cyber operations
targeting a state's nuclear command and control where states, like
Russia, have already staked out declaratory policies.]{.underline}
Moreover, states are still at a nascent stage in developing shared
indices to inform assessments of intent in cyberspace, especially when
it comes to cyber operations in nuclear crises.

Therefore, [even if Russia would not take the cataclysmic step of
escalating to the first use of nuclear weapons in response to a U.S.
cyber operation, it could misinterpret U.S. signaling efforts and take
measures to make nuclear use easier]{.underline} (such as making
warheads operational, dispersing forces, pre-delegating authority, or
increasing automaticity). **[These readiness measures could increase the
chances of inadvertent or even accidental escalation.]{.underline}**

### Cyber signaling bad -- risks escalation 

#### Cyber operations for deterrent purposes risks escalation

accessed 7/4/22, GDI-cc\]

So far, the Biden administration has attempted to dismiss Russia's
announcement as irresponsible saber-rattling. But [as Putin continues
issuing nuclear threats, policymakers are likely to feel growing
pressure to respond]{.underline}. In particular, [they may be tempted to
find ways to signal to Russia to deter the use of nuclear weapons. One
way this might be done is through cyber operations.]{.underline} In
fact, [some cyber experts]{.underline} are already calling for the
United States to consider cyber attacks for signaling purposes. For
example, writing in the Washington Post, Dmitri Alperovitch and Samuel
Charap call on the Biden administration to consider a cyber
"shock-and-awe demonstration" in response to a major Russian cyber
attack against the West. They [claim]{.underline} that [such a response,
which could include disrupting the Internet throughout Russia, would
signal U.S. resolve and help prevent further escalation]{.underline}
that they fear "could result in nuclear war."

[However, conducting cyber operations to signal deterrence would,
paradoxically, increase risks of escalation. This risk is not just
hypothetical,]{.underline} [especially in light of Russia's updated
declaratory policy for the first use of nuclear weapons, which may
include responses to cyber attacks]{.underline}. Russia has reinforced
this message during the war in Ukraine. In early March, a hacking group
affiliated with Anonymous claimed that it had shut down the control
center of Russia's space agency. While denying that the attack took
place, [Russia nevertheless warned that a cyber attack against its
satellites would be a justification for war.]{.underline}

The [Biden administration should clearly communicate that cyber
operations for nuclear signaling are out of bounds]{.underline}, just as
it declared restraint in other aspects of this conflict, like the
deployment of American troops to Ukraine.

### Cyber signaling bad -- nuclear use 

#### Cyber operations implicate nuclear command and control in a limited way -- but ambiguity of cyber operations risks use it or lose it mentality that increases risks of escalation to nuclear weapons use 

**Lonergan and Yarhi-Milo, 2022**

[Policymakers and academics are attuned to the cyber risks to nuclear
command and control]{.underline}. The practitioner community has largely
focused on U.S. vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them. Scholars, in
turn, worry about how [cyber operations could have unintended escalatory
consequences]{.underline}. But less attention has been paid to another
likely scenario: [the use of cyber operations for signaling purposes
(operations with visible effects that aim to convey a message to another
state) in a nuclear context]{.underline}. [The ambiguity of cyber
operations can sometimes be useful for signaling --- but the same
ambiguity can be dangerous during a nuclear crisis. The problem is that
civilian leaders in particular]{.underline}, distinct from the military,
[are inclined to see cyber attacks as effective signaling
tools.]{.underline}

[Cyber operations could have nuclear implications, especially because
modern nuclear command and control systems, like those in Russia and the
United States, are becoming increasingly dependent on digital
infrastructure]{.underline}. [Nuclear command, control, and
communications systems]{.underline}, which include early warning,
information collection, and communications capabilities, [alert
decision-makers to impending nuclear strikes and also enable leaders to
control decisions about nuclear use (or non-use]{.underline}). But
[their digital dependencies are creating opportunities for exploitation
using cyber means. I]{.underline}n a 2020 report, the Nuclear Threat
Initiative found that "almost 9 out of 10 planned nuclear modernization
programs involve at least some new digital components or upgrades."

[Vulnerabilities inherent in the digital infrastructure that undergird
modern nuclear systems]{.underline} [provide opportunities]{.underline}
for actors to engage in [cyber espionage]{.underline} --- gaining access
to a network or system to steal information --- [or even conduct cyber
attacks]{.underline}. Hypothetically, a cyber power like Russia could
conduct a cyber attack against a U.S. early warning satellite to degrade
its functionality. This has become an urgent concern for practitioners.
U.S. Strategic Command, for instance, is currently working to
"operationally harden NC3 systems against cyber threats." Congress has
also gotten involved, requiring the Defense Department to evaluate the
cybersecurity of major weapon systems. And the Government Accountability
Office has published multiple reports decrying the state of
cybersecurity and scope of vulnerabilities of weapon systems, including
elements of the nuclear triad.

From an academic perspective, [scholars have investigated how cyber
operations targeting nuclear systems could exacerbate escalation
risks]{.underline}. Focusing on nuclear forces, early research, such as
work by Martin Libicki, was skeptical of the dangers posed by cyber
operations. [Nuclear forces were seen as being largely immune from
digital attacks because they were "air gapped," meaning that they were
separated from information technology systems.]{.underline}

[However, as nuclear systems have become increasingly intertwined with
the digital environment]{.underline} --- not to mention the dual-use
nature of many elements of nuclear command, control, and communications
systems (like early warning or position, navigation, and timing
satellites) --- [the protection offered by being segregated from the
internet is less robust]{.underline}. Jacquelyn Schneider, Benjamin
Schechter, and Rachael Schaffer, for instance, [ran a series of wargames
demonstrating that decision-makers in hypothetical crises are likely to
use their cyber exploits against an adversary's nuclear
systems]{.underline}. They [found that this could have negative effects
on states' respective nuclear strategies,]{.underline} [especially
decisions to pre-delegate nuclear launch authority or automate nuclear
responses]{.underline}. Erik Gartzke and Jon Lindsay argue that the
clandestine nature of cyber operations means that one state could
secretly gain access to an adversary's nuclear command, control, and
communications systems, giving the former an information advantage or
[even creating an incentive for the latter to use its nuclear weapons
out of the fear that it may lose them]{.underline}. James Acton notes
that the [difficulties of distinguishing between cyber espionage and
attack could lead a state to misperceive the intent behind a cyber
operation, generating a similar "use it or lose it"
calculus]{.underline}.

### Cyber signaling -- misuse increases risk 

#### Cyber signaling ineffective because of difficulties -- but use by civilian leadership increases risk of escalation that outweigh benefits

But [all of this focus on cyber operations causing nuclear escalation
may be misplaced and, more importantly]{.underline}, [distract
policymakers from the dangers of a more plausible scenario: the use of
ambiguous cyber signals during nuclear crises]{.underline}.
Specifically, [the nature of cyber operations reduces their inherent
escalatory potential,]{.underline} particularly when compared to other
ways a state could attack an adversary's nuclear forces or command,
control, and communications systems, like a direct counterforce strike
or employing anti-satellite weapons. [But their misuse as a signaling
tool could do more harm than good.]{.underline}

First[, successfully conducting cyber operations against strategic
targets, like nuclear systems, is harder than the conventional wisdom
might suggest]{.underline}. It requires a means of gaining access to a
particular system and developing an exploit to cause a desired effect
--- and then maintaining persistent (and stealthy) access to be able to
conduct an offensive operation at the desired time. Moreover, [the
overall outcome may be unpredictable and net less-than-desirable
results.]{.underline}

Second, [even if a state is able to conduct these kinds of operations,
they typically prefer to do so in secret]{.underline} --- and this
mitigates some escalation concerns. That's because, to cause an
escalatory response, a state like Russia would have to uncover a cyber
operation during a particular time period --- such as while the Ukraine
conflict is unfolding. For example, [Russia would have to detect a cyber
operation against a nuclear command and control system to cause Putin to
perceive a "window of vulnerability," perhaps assessing that it is part
of a U.S. or NATO counterforce strategy to disable Russia's ability to
retaliate with nuclear weapons.]{.underline} But [the likelihood of
these circumstances arising is low because]{.underline} --- unless a
state is trying to signal with a cyber capability --- [it will try to
keep these kinds of sensitive operations secret. Therefore, the chances
of such an operation being discovered at a particular time period are
relatively small.]{.underline}

Finally, even if, hypothetically, Russia was to discover a cyber
operation taking place, [the likelihood of it leading to escalation is
low. This is due to the virtual nature of cyber "weapons]{.underline}"
--- [they rarely cause destruction in the physical world, let alone
permanent damage.]{.underline} For example, even Russia's 2015 cyber
attack against Ukraine's power grid, an important example of a strategic
cyber attack against civilian critical infrastructure, only resulted in
service disruptions for a few hours. [During the current conflict,
Russia-linked actors have so far been stymied in using cyber operations
for strategic impact]{.underline}, such as the failed cyber attack by
the group Sandworm against Ukraine's power grid.

[Taken together, this reasoning suggests that, in practice, cyber
operations may not rise to a level that would cause a state like Russia
to actually fear the integrity of its nuclear command, control, and
communications systems, creating few reasons to escalate to the level of
nuclear employment.]{.underline}

Civil-Military Relations and the Risks of Cyber Signaling in Nuclear
Crises

[Differences in how civilian and military leaders see the use of
military power are likely to be even more salient in
cyberspace]{.underline}, for three reasons. First, [cyberspace is a
highly technical environment where civilians typically lack subject
matter expertise.]{.underline} Practitioners are likely to have far more
up-to-date operational experience and, therefore, fluency with the
technical issues and constraints posed by cyber operations than civilian
leaders (even those with prior and, potentially, outmoded experience).
[Cyberspace is also a [highly
classified](https://mwi.usma.edu/overclassification-and-its-impact-on-cyber-conflict-and-democracy/) environment]{.underline}
--- one in which information is highly segmented and only accessible to
a select group of individuals. Therefore, some civilian officials may
not be privy to all of the details surrounding cyber operations.
Finally, [unlike other technical and secretive environments, cyberspace
has an additional element that makes it even more difficult for
non-experts to grasp its nature. Specifically, cyberspace is also an
esoteric environment; cyber operations and their effects are not easily
visible in a way that other types of military capabilities are, making
it difficult to conceptualize their utility in a tangible
manner.]{.underline}

[There is evidence supporting this idea. For instance, senior civilian
leaders across multiple U.S. administrations, as well as in Congress,
typically describe cyber operations as useful for signaling deterrence
and resolve]{.underline}. Chris Inglis, the Biden administration's
inaugural National Cyber
Director, [described](https://www.afcea.org/content/national-cyber-leader-ponders-response-vectors-cyber-adversaries) how
he'd "like to change the decision calculus of those who transgress in
this space," and contemplated that "\[p\]erhaps our actions should be
felt by an adversary. They should know that they have just felt the hand
of whomever." Similarly, Senator Angus
King, [discussing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/30/cybersecurity-202-angus-king-says-its-time-get-tougher-russian-hackers/) the
threat of Russian-linked ransomware attacks in the summer of 2021, noted
that he wants "somebody ... in the Politburo to say, 'Gee, boss, I'm not
sure we ought to do this because we're liable to get whacked in some way
by those Americans.'"

John [Bolton]{.underline}, former national security advisor, in multiple
public statements, has [depicted the purpose of U.S. cyber operations
--- especially offensive ones --- as a means of influencing adversary
perception.]{.underline}
He [described](https://news.grabien.com/making-transcript-white-house-press-briefing-national-cyber-strateg) how
[the employment of offensive cyber power creates "structures of
deterrence, so that it's publicly known," and that "it is important that
our adversaries know \[that\] ...we have authorized offensive cyber
operations to ... demonstrate to our adversaries that the costs of
engaging in operations against us is higher than they want to
bear."]{.underline} Michael [Daniel,]{.underline} the Obama
administration's cyber
czar,[ [depict](https://www.yahoo.com/news/obama-cyber-chief-confirms-stand-order-russian-cyberattacks-summer-2016-204935758.html?guccounter=1)ed the
purpose of imposing costs on Russia]{.underline} in response to its 2016
election interference as ["to openly demonstrate that we could do it as
a deterrent and also clandestinely disrupt their operations as
well."]{.underline}

In contrast, [while some military leaders do talk about cyber
deterrence, the language they employ is anchored in tactical and
operational objectives, rather than aiming to influence adversary
perception and decision-making]{.underline}. This is evident in how both
civilian and military leaders use the language of "imposing costs."
Military leaders tend to describe cost-imposition as supporting the
disruption, degradation, denial, or destruction of adversary offensive
capabilities and operations. For instance, in December 2021, Gen. Paul
Nakasone, commander of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National
Security Agency (NSA), described "imposing costs" against Russian-linked
ransomware groups as the goal in itself. The month prior, at the
November 2021 Aspen Security Forum, he argued for the United States to
impose costs in cyberspace, but stated that a traditional deterrence
strategy "does not comport to cyberspace." In another example, in 2019,
Lt. Gen. Stephen Fogarty, commander of Army Cyber Command, voiced
skepticism about cyber deterrence in remarks about defending the 2020
elections against cyber interference, noting that "I don't know of a
single thing we could do that would prevent \[adversaries\] from
competing, but I want to impose as much cost on them as possible."

## Military to military exercises -- general 

### Military to military exercises -- general 

#### Military to military cyber exercises like Locked Shield fail -- multiple warrants

It is May 2019 and a conference room of the Nordic Hotel in Tallinn is
once again transformed into a situation room. There is a large
scoreboard and map on the wall, and several tables, each with multiple
screens set up. The conference room is filled with people wearing
different color shirts and lanyards that indicate their team and role. A
government delegation is being given a tour from an exercise organizer
wearing green. This is the scene of the largest international technical
cyber exercise in the world, Locked Shields, run by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of
Excellence (CCDCOE)

CCDCOE started organizing Locked Shields in 2012--preceded by the Baltic
Cyber Shield, a one-off exercise in 2010. [In 2021, Locked Shields had
over two thousand participants. Thirty countries have participated so
far, including a NATO alliance team and non-NATO member states Australia
and Japan.]{.underline} Over the past decade, [military exercises have
increasingly focused on cyber-related scenarios, which present unique
opportunities and challenges for military planners.]{.underline} [The
main opportunities of military cyber exercises lie in the collection and
analysis of data and the signaling of operational
capability]{.underline}. The challenges to military cyber exercises stem
from difficulties defining an appropriate ruleset and the resources
required to create a realistic training environment with realistic
timeframes and dynamics.

[Military cyber exercises come in various shapes and forms]{.underline}:
from specific, nationally oriented exercises such as Operation Eligible
Receiver, organized by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1997, to more
general, internationally oriented exercises like Cyber Coalition,
organized annually by NATO. Some exercises are more offense-oriented,
such as Crossed Swords, while other games lay the emphasis on defense,
like Locked Shields.

[Military cyber exercises are generally run in a virtual environment.
The benefit of which is the organizer's ability to collect data as the
activities of different teams can be more easily recorded. Whilst
traffic logs and other data are not always easy to digest, it often
creates the opportunity for more granular analyses of moves ex post
facto.]{.underline}

S[ignaling cyber capability is notoriously difficult.]{.underline}
However, [military cyber exercises can be used as a means of signaling
capability and willingness to conduct or respond to cyber
operations]{.underline}. "You cannot parade computer code on the streets
of Moscow", but you can create a scenario in which you successfully
mitigate simulated malicious code in Moscow's transportation
infrastructure.

But [military cyber exercises also come with their own challenges. It is
difficult to create a realistic exercise without a realistic
battleground.]{.underline} [Setting up an environment for military cyber
exercises is not cheap; an extreme case is the U.S. Department of
Defense's plans for a new global cyber training environment, which is
expected to cost roughly \$1 billion]{.underline}.

Second, [military cyber exercises hardly ever stretch longer than a few
days. This may set misleading expectations about the nature of cyber
operations]{.underline}. We know that [unique decision-making dynamics
in cyber operations stem from their timeframe]{.underline}. Preparation
of more advanced cyber operations takes time, a reality which may have
affected the ability of Russian hackers to attack Ukrainian systems.
[Also, it often takes considerable time to move from initial access to
fulfilling strategic objectives in a cyber operation. The installation
of a backdoor in one phase may lead to the dropping of malware only many
months later.]{.underline}

[The short duration of military cyber exercises can also negatively
impact officials' conception of the strategic potential of this
space]{.underline}. Military cyber exercises generally revolve around a
set of highly disruptive or destructive cyberattacks for a relatively
short period--a typical scenario is an attack on critical infrastructure
by an adversarial state. However[, much of what we have been observing
in cyberspace are multi-year campaigns comprised of linked cyber
operations, with the objective of achieving strategic outcomes without
the need of armed attack]{.underline}. Incorporating this understanding
of the multifaceted and simultaneous nature of cyber activity is
challenging under such time restrictions.

Also, [in the case of Locked Shields, it is hard to promote NATO's
principles of collective defense]{.underline}. Inter-team cooperation
and collaboration between the countries' blue teams in tackling cyber
incidents has been a goal since Locked Shields' beginnings. In early
versions of the exercise, teams could score extra points for cooperation
with other teams. However, it proved difficult to measure cooperation in
a meaningful way during Locked Shields and reconcile it with the
competition element of the exercise.

Finally, [one inevitable aspect of military exercises is that they come
to an end. And while it is hard to predict the cyber future, one thing
we can be certain about is that cyber operations are not ending any time
soon]{.underline}. At the conclusion of the three days, Locked Shields
crowns a winning defending blue team based on their performance under
attack and a score they receive. [Victory in cyberspace will never be
this clear.]{.underline}

## Memo of Understanding 

#### MOU won't work to solve issues with the allies' coordination on offensive cyber operations

**Smeets,** ETH Zurich, Center for Security Studies, **2020**

\[Max "U.S. Cyber Strategy of Persistent Engagement & Defend Forward:
Implications for the Alliance and Intelligence Collection" [Intelligence
and National Security]{.underline} vol 35, 2020 -- Issue 3, Taylor and
Francis Online accessed 7/5/2022 GDI-TM\]

Conclusion and Discussion

The purpose of this paper was to provide a benefit-risk assessment of US
strategy for its allies and intelligence collection. [Whilst the U.S.
government's mission to persistently engage with adversaries may have
benefits for allied states, the paper identified several avenues how the
strategy leads to negative implications for the alliance.]{.underline}
To conclude, it is therefore worth considering how these risks can be
mitigated.

First, the [principles of persistent engagement and defend forward are
often jointly discussed. How the two principles relate to each other,
however, remains unclear]{.underline}. According to some, [persistent
engagement is an 'operationalization' of the defend forward
concept.]{.underline} Others believe there is a difference between the
two concepts. If the latter is the case, it is important to assess to
what degree a strategy of persistent engagement necessitates 'defending
forward' and contesting adversaries wherever they are. In other words,
the question is whether sufficient friction can be created without
causing disruption in allied networks. Second, terminology about terrain
in cyberspace is frequently confused by policymakers and experts. The
U.S. government needs to (re)assess how its terminology of terrain in
the physical domains applies to cyberspace.

Last, [NATO allies should consider establishing memoranda of
understanding on offensive cyber effects operations in systems or
networks based in allied territory]{.underline}.xlvii [The goal of the
proposed memorandum would be to reduce discord among the allies; enhance
trust, transparency and confidence between allies; and improve the
effectiveness of disrupting and deterring adversaries' operations in
cyberspace.]{.underline} The [scope of the memorandum would
include]{.underline}: i) [developing a common notification equity
framework for out-of-networks operations which seek to achieve cyber
effects in allied systems or networks]{.underline}; ii) [identifying
procedures for communicating]{.underline} the consideration and [conduct
of offensive cyber effects]{.underline} [operations]{.underline} between
states against systems or networks in allied territory; and iii)
[identifying technical solutions and administrative documentation
required for the continuous exchange of information on offensive cyber
operations.]{.underline} In writing the memorandum, states first and
foremost should agree on the equities involved in permitting signatories
to conduct cyber effect operations in each other's networks---and the
relative weight of those equities. Equities that should be considered
include: i) the ability of an actor to take action to negate known
threats on or to the other parties' networks and systems; ii) the
likelihood that an action will negate known threats; iii) the imminence
and scale of the threat; iv) the risk of collateral damage; v) whether
the computer system or network is government-owned or privately owned;
and vi) the certainty that the system or network will be used to achieve
strategic effects by the adversary.xlviii Finally, [though the
memorandum of understanding may help in promoting stability and
enhancing confidence amongst allies, it is not a silver
bullet.]{.underline} It can only reduce allied concerns rather than
mitigate them. Military cyber organizations may still conduct
effect-based operations in allied territory without consent, leading
allies to assert that their sovereignty has been violated. Furthermore,
there is another crucial player involved. As Gen. Nakasone noted in the
Joint Force Quarterly article, cyberspace is owned largely by the
private sector. They deserve a seat at the table as well.xlix

Introduction

[For decades, few NATO members, predominantly the US, could conduct
offensive cyberspace operations]{.underline} (OCO). Hence, [there was
little requirement for coordination with allies.]{.underline} [This has
changed: the economical threshold to acquire offensive cyberspace
operations capabilities (]{.underline}OCOC) [has fallen to a level where
more than half of NATO's members now claim to have these
means]{.underline}. These developments have made NATO adjust.

Historically, [NATO's planning and coordination has been based on shared
knowledge of the members' military capabilities, to a degree even their
nuclear capabilities]{.underline}. [In the cyber domain, the principle
has evolved to include the allies' emerging defensive cyber
capabilities]{.underline}. [NATO's approach to OCOC]{.underline},
however, [deviates radically]{.underline}: [NATO's doctrine merely
integrate offensive cyber effects]{.underline}, that is, [allow members
to offer them in operations without sharing information with allies on
what OCOC are available or how the effects are delivered]{.underline}.
[NATO is a well-established mechanism to coordinate the members'
military means.]{.underline} This core function is the bedrock of
military strategy for some small members, for example, Denmark. Hence,
[NATO's and the individual members' notable divergence from historical
practice when it comes to OCOCs presents a puzzle.]{.underline}

[The technical and tactical characteristics particular to OCOCs differ
significantly from conventional military means. Among the particular
characteristics are the extraordinarily strong incentives to keep any
aspect of OCOCs secret, even from other allies. This creates new and
unique dilemmas for allies and inhibit OCOCs' use in military
alliances]{.underline}. [Either the allies providing OCO's effects risk
sharing sensitive information on the OCOCs or the allies, who depend on
the provided effects, must accept the proposed effects without
sufficient knowledge of the deployed OCOCs to assess their efficacy,
legality, or impact on own offensive or defensive cyberspace
operations]{.underline}.

The constraints on NATO's ability to coordinate OCOCs will likely remain
insur- mountable for years to come. This may explain why NATO developed
the Sovereign Cyber Effects, Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA)
concept which allows the allies to circumvent some of the challenges
associated with coordination (NATO 2020, 5,16). [The SCEPVA-construct
enable integration of OCOCs in operations while sharing little or no
information on the deployed means]{.underline}. [SCEPVA's are in NATO's
own words not the most effective way to fully utilize the allies'
combined OCO potential]{.underline} (NATO 2020, 26). However, [the
construct provides a pragmatic doctrinal framework for NATO to train and
develop procedures and eventually integrate the effects of OCO in
operations.]{.underline}

#### Allies can't solve -- their institutional capacity to limited

Implications for the Alliance and Intelligence Collection" [Intelligence
and National Security]{.underline} vol 35, 2020 -- Issue 3, Taylor and
Francis Online accessed 7/5/2022 GDI-TM\]

Last year the NATO alliance reached a landmark that went largely
unnoticed: there are now more NATO member states that have publicly
declared they are seeking to establish an institutional capacity within
the military forces to conduct cyber effects operations than there are
member states that have remained publicly silent on this issue.xliv
Yet[, most NATO members are still at the early stages of organizational
development - and pour relatively few resources into their military
cyber organizations to conduct cyber effects operations]{.underline}.xlv
[Their operational capacity is limited]{.underline}. France and Germany
stand out for the extent of resources officially allocated to their
military cyber organizations (beyond the Five-Eyes) - but public
statements about these figures are generally hard to interpret and
compare given distinct institutional design across military cyber
organizations of states.xlvi [This risk is therefore less significant
for the short term, but is likely to grow in the medium to long
term.]{.underline}

### SQuo -- NATO lacks offensive coordination

#### NATO lacks effective coordination of offensive cyber capabilities outside of warfighting context, results in failure to deter most significant threats to NATO in cyber grey zone

[NATO members are in the midst of a crisis]{.underline}. With Russia
massing troops along its border with Ukraine and moving additional
forces to Belarus ostensibly to conduct joint military exercises,
policymakers fear that Russia is on the precipice of invading Ukraine
and taking additional territory by force---similar to Russia's
annexation of Crimea in 2014. But, even if Russian President Vladimir
Putin ultimately chooses not to launch a direct, conventional invasion
of Ukraine, it is highly likely that he will continue to pursue Russian
strategic objectives in the gray zone short of war. [The crisis over
Ukraine underscores the challenges NATO faces in competing with Russia
in the gray zone---especially in cyberspace.]{.underline}

[Russia has no such limitations in the gray zone. In addition to
traditional forms of irregular warfare, such as the use of plausibly
deniable proxy forces]{.underline} (Putin's "little green men["), Russia
has long relied on cyber operations to subvert and undermine rival
governments]{.underline} while [avoiding actions]{.underline} that would
cross a threshold [prompting]{.underline} an overwhelming
[retaliation]{.underline}. Indeed, in tandem with Russia's conventional
military buildup, Ukrainian government agencies were struck with a spate
of website defacements. Microsoft also revealed that it had discovered
destructive malware in some Ukrainian government systems, which
Ukrainian officials have linked to the Belarusian group GhostWriter.
Belarus has close ties to Russia, and observers have speculated that
Belarus may have been operating in cyberspace on Russia's behalf.

While Ukraine is not a NATO member, [the current situation underscores
the enduring strategic challenge the alliance faces in addressing the
cyber threat posed by Russia and other actors.]{.underline} In
particular[, because cost imposition is an integral part of any
deterrence strategy]{.underline} (and has been part of NATO's
conventional deterrence strategy), the [alliance has begun to explore
how it could incorporate offensive cyber operations as a component of
its cyber deterrence posture]{.underline}. But, while NATO took
important steps to address cyber defense, it took nearly a decade after
Russia's 2007 cyberattack against Estonia to begin to seriously address
the issue of offensive cyber operations. Moreover, [NATO cyber policy
has traditionally focused on cyber operations in a warfighting
contex]{.underline}t---[a focus that comes at the expense of considering
cyber operations below the level of warfare.]{.underline} As the recent
cyberattacks against Ukraine illustrate, [the gray zone just beneath the
threshold of armed conflict is where NATO faces its most significant
cyber threats]{.underline}. With NATO in the middle of conducting a
comprehensive initiative, NATO 2030, to strengthen the alliance, it
should incorporate an assessment of the role of cyber operations in
routine competition.

#### Squo recognition of need for offensive cyber too limited and fails respond to the cyber threat environment NATO faces outside of active warfighting

Offensive Cyber Operations in NATO Strategy Above and Below the Level of
Warfare

Historically, [NATO's cyber posture has largely focused on defense and
resilience---and this continues to form the bulk of NATO's
approach.]{.underline} The alliance maintains that its "main focus in
cyber defence is to protect its own networks (including operations and
missions) and enhance resilience." At the 2014 Wales summit, NATO
endorsed the Enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, which affirmed that cyber
defense is part of collective defense and that the alliance would
incorporate cyber defense into its planning and operations. In 2016,
NATO members pledged to improve their cyber defenses through training,
education, exercises, and information sharing.

But the seeds were also planted in [2016]{.underline} for NATO to
consider a potential role for offensive cyber operations. That year,
[the alliance recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations,
comparable to land, sea, and air]{.underline}. At the 2018 Brussels
summit, NATO began to more seriously consider offensive cyber
operations. Specifically, [NATO created the Cyberspace Operations Centre
to coordinate requests for member states to provide offensive cyber
effects through the Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by
Allies process.]{.underline} Following the 2018 summit, then-Secretary
of Defense James Mattis stated in a press conference that five
states---the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, the
Netherlands, and Estonia---were contributing cyber forces to "help NATO
fight in this important domain." More recently, in June 2021,
[NATO]{.underline} convened in Brussels and committed to a
[Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy.]{.underline} A [key
feature]{.underline} of the new policy [is the prominent role of
offensive cyber operations.]{.underline} In Brussels, member states
committed to "employ the full range of capabilities at all times to
actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of cyber
threats."

[NATO's shift to incorporating offensive cyber operations into existing
strategy and policy has focused on integrating offensive effects into
conventional military plans and operations in the context of a
conflict.]{.underline} [While]{.underline} NATO's updated strategy is [a
positive development, its limited focus on conflict scenarios for
employing cyber power fails to accurately account for the cyber threat
environment NATO faces---particularly the mismatch between the
alliance's clear distinction between wartime and peacetime and the
approach of adversaries like Russia, who adopt a competition-conflict
continuum]{.underline}. Additionally, [the focus on employing offensive
cyber during a high-end conventional fight is also not consistent with
how several NATO members are already engaged in gray zone offensive
cyber operations.]{.underline}

[NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction teams are already equipped to conduct
defensive cyber operations in support of member states if called
upon]{.underline}. [A mandate of cyber defence and security implies,
however, that NATO also starts to engage in active military measures to
deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, or destroy an adversary's offensive
cyber capabilities. This requires the development of not only offensive
cyber A2/AD capabilities by Allies, but also the restructuring of the
NATO command structures, policies, processes (procurement, intelligence,
operations, etc.) and engagements needed to integrate them by the
Alliance.]{.underline} NATO coordination with both national and regional
entities charged with cyber security aspects will, in particular, need
to be enhanced. Many agreements already exist in the realm of defensive
cyber at national and regional levels (as seen with the 2016 NATO-EU
Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defence), but [political consensus among
Allies is missing on whether they should be expanded to incorporate the
collective use of offensive cyber A2/AD capabilities.]{.underline}

\*OCO - offensive cyberspace operations

\*OCOC - offensive cyberspace operations capabilities

This article fills a gap in the strategic literature by investigating
some effects of OCOCs and OCO's on alliances. [NATO is a relevant
empirical case study: it is by far the world's largest collective
defense arrangement and at least 16 members already claim to have or
strive to get OCOCs.]{.underline} [At least nine of these have pledged
to make them available in support of NATO operations]{.underline} (Vavra
2019). Furthermore, NATO provide some empirical evidence to the
analysis, having worked with the challenges of integrating member
states' emerging offensive cyber capabilities since at least 2016 when
the alliance acknowledged cyberspace as an operational domain (Ablon et
al. 2019, 1). [This has produced both academic debate and concrete
outcomes, that is, organizational adaptations and doctrine like the
Cyberspace Operations Center (CyOC) and the AJP-3.20,]{.underline}
Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations (Brent 2019; NATO 2020).

After this introduction follows a presentation of definitions,
methodology and a short review of current strategic literature on this
topic. Then, the article describes NATO's current approach to the
allies' OCOCs and including OCO's effects in operations and compares
with NATO's approaches to conventional weapons, nuclear weapons, and
defensive cyber means to identify differences. The initial conclusion is
[that NATO's approach to coordination of allies' OCOCs is indeed
different and much more restricted than to the other three
categories.]{.underline}

The second part of the article present the main argument: [five
technical and tactical characteristics of OCOCs cause special dilemmas
that make their coordinated use in alliances more difficult than
conventional military means]{.underline}. Based on the identified chal-
lenges to coordination of OCOCs, the article concludes that [NATO's
ambition will likely remain limited to their inclusion rather than
coordination.]{.underline} The article suggests that this situation may
change [if the nations providing OCO effects differentiate more between
"mundane" OCOCs based on standard tools that are sharable, and advanced,
tailored OCOCs based on sensitive information that will likely remain
outside the scope of full coordination between allies.]{.underline}
Also, a sufficiently significant crisis and the need to respond will
likely induce NATO members to overcome some of the concerns that
inhibits coordination between allies, especially if information exchange
can be limited to a minimum of member states.

The limited literature on offensive cyber, alliances, and strategy

[Most academic literature on offensive cyber strategy is written from a
great power perspective and does not consider its use in
alliances]{.underline}. Instead, [the literature focuses on the
first-order effects of a state's actions against its opponents. For a
small state, the second-order effect on its allies of its military
actions may be far more important than the first-order effect on its
opponent]{.underline} (Jakobsen et al. 2016, 10--12).

Smeets (Smeets 2018b) and Fasana (Fasana 2018) discuss the values and
risks of integration of OCOs in military operations, but do not analyze
their use in coalitions. Hughes and Colarik (Hughes and Colarik 2016)
encompass both small states, alli- ances and OCOCs by identifying the
theoretical advantages and risks, which they expect New Zealand would
incur by developing OCOCs and investigating how these could be deployed
within New Zealand's military cooperation with, for example, Australia
or the U.S. Hughes and Colarik assume that New Zealand can coordinate
use of OCOs in a military coalition with the U.S. or the other Five-Eyes
intelligence sharing community, Australia, Canada, and United Kingdom,
on a par with conven- tional means (Hughes and Colarik 2016, 173;
Tossini 2017). New Zealand is not currently in any military alliance but
retains very close relations with the U.S. (State Department 2020).

In a theoretical coalition involving the U.S., New +Zealand, and other
Five-Eyes- members, [coordination of OCOs would likely be less
challenging than between NATO's 30 members due to fewer members and the
well-established Five-Eyes framework for sharing classified
information.]{.underline} Still, this article challenges Hughes and
Colarik's assump- tion of information [sharing-based coordination of
OCOs]{.underline} between close allies by demon- strating why this is
[likely to involve difficult dilemmas in any alliance regardless how
small and close-knit it might be.]{.underline}

### OCOCs coordination fail -- advanced 

#### The more advanced the OCO, the less likely member states sharing occurs

\*OCOC - offensive cyberspace operations capabilities

Offensive cyberspace operations, capabilities, and strategy

NATO defines cyberspace as "The global domain consisting of all
interconnected com- munication, information technology, and other
electronic systems, networks and their data, including those which are
separated or independent, which process, store or transmit data." [OCO
are defined as "Actions in or through cyberspace that project power to
create effects, which achieve military objectives]{.underline}" (NATO
2020, 4). To facilitate the present analysis, the [non-doctrinal term
"Offensive Cyberspace Operation Capabilities" (OCOC) is introduced to
cover the capabilities, or example, technology, trained personnel,
command and control, etc., necessary to enable states to conduct
military OCO.]{.underline}

**[NATO's definitions of OCO follow the definitions of current US
doctrines]{.underline}** -- but it's very broad. To focus the analysis,
this article harks back to older US doctrines that distinguish between
two different categories of OCO as shown in figure 1 below: Computer
Network Attacks (CNA) and Computer Network Exploitation (CNE). While no
longer officially in use, CNE and CNA are analytically very helpful
categories (NIST n.d.). CNA are OCOs to disrupt, deny, degrade, or
destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the
computers and networks themselves (Joint Chiefs of Staff 1998, GL-5).
The older US doctrine's definitions of CNA effects vary slightly from,
but are all covered by, the effects listed in the NATO doctrine (NATO
2020, 18). CNA's effects are not limited to data and the associated
IT-hardware, but may be inflicted on any physical hardware connected to
the cyber-affected systems directly or indirectly as second or higher
order effect. In the Russian 2015 "Black Energy"-attack that resulted in
power outages for nearly 225,000 people in Western Ukraine, CNAs
directly targeted substations' hardware on the Ukrainian electricity
distribution grid (Colatin 2021). The dramatic impact of the 2021 CNA on
Colonial Pipeline, where criminals hijacked a US fuel distribution com-
pany's data, may have been second-order effects resulting from to the
company's attempts to limit the impact of the initial attack.
Regardless, the CNA halted operations for days, caused a 45% drop in
fuel distribution and made 17 states on the US east coast declare a
state of emergency (Turton and Mehrota 2021; Panettieri 2021).

[This analysis distinguishes between advanced and un-advanced OCOCs. In
this regard, "advanced" does not refer to the technical complexity of
the code employed, but to the degree that the offensive cyber capability
is tailored to a specific target and/or dependent on comprehensive
intelligence collection for its design]{.underline}. It is a distinction
between "a small number of weapons or targeted actions and a very large
number of more indiscriminate tools" (Taillat 2019, 372). [Advanced
OCOCs are based on intelli- gence collected clandestinely which means
sharing information on the OCOCs may jeopardize intelligence assets,
means, and methods. Thus, un-advanced OCOCs are relatively common and
mundane means for OCO, perhaps similar to, or copies of, means used by
cyber criminals.]{.underline}

CNE is qualitatively distinctly different from CNA: CNE is cyber-enabled
espionage, "enabling operations and intelligence collection capabilities
conducted through the use of computer networks to gather data from
target or adversary information systems or networks" (Department of the
Army 2003, 2--11). that is, CNE is an OCO that conducts "seeing without
touching" whereas CNA is an OCO intended to inflict some degree of
damage.

This analysis does not include CNE or other cyber-enabled offensive
operations, for example, misinformation distributed on social media and
targeted by algorithms. Why? Because like CNA, CNE and cyber enabled or
enhanced propaganda and misinformation can have significant strategic
offensive effects (Lin 2019; Rogin 2012). However, neither CNE nor
misinformation represent new qualitatively new means for states to wield
coercive power. Thus, their effects on alliances, including NATO, are
not new either. Admittedly, cyber brings new nuances, for example, by
increasing the potential speed, scope, and scale of such operations by
orders of magnitude compared to the analog past (Søilen 2016).
Furthermore, CNE is arguably relevant to the present analysis due to the
potential strategic side effects of alliance members' individual
tactical CNE: because CNE often is a necessary precursor to CNA, the
line between CNE and CNA is blurred (Smeets 2018b, 9). Thus, it can be
difficult from a victim's perspective to assess whether CNE is "just"
cyber espionage or preparations for CNA. In addition, [attribution may
be uncer- tain, and misinterpretations could lead an opponent to
undertake unintended escalatory actions, perhaps against the entire
alliance.]{.underline} Hence, from a theoretical perspective, ideally
even CNE should be a coordinated effort in alliances. Even so, CNE is
excluded from the analysis because intelligence collection always has
been a prerogative of the individual NATO members and is highly likely
to remain so.

Strategy is interpreted according to Yarger et al: "Strategy is all
about how (way or concept) leadership will use the power (means or
resources) available to the state to exercise control over sets of
circumstances and geographic locations to achieve objec- tives (ends)
that support state interests." (Yarger and Boone Bartholomees 2012, 45).
In this analysis, [OCOCs are means that statesin this case,
NATO-members, use for raisons d'état. The analysis is based on the
assumption that NATO's members are rational, self- interested states, an
assumption that is admittedly over-simplifying.]{.underline} For
example, [different types of OCOCs should in principle present different
levels of challenges to coordinate, as the difficulties arise from the
states' inclination to keep these means secret. This inclination should
increase along with the risk they pose to, for example, sensitive
intelligence assets --]{.underline} and fall if this risk was low.
Hence, in theory, obstacles to CNA coordination should vary from trivial
to insurmountable if NATO members were pragmatic about their use and
classified OCOCs according to risk. However, the very limited empirical
evidence suggests that most OCOCs are highly classified and "national
eyes only," leaving them in or around the insurmountable category.
Still, the assumption of rational self-interested states will provide a
baseline of insights in the alliance-related dilemmas emerging along
with the NATO members' increasing OCOCs.

On that note, and emphasized throughout the article, the entire topic of
military OCOCs is shrouded in secrecy. This limits the analysis to
available information from reputable public sources, combined with
generally accepted characteristics of OCOCs as presented in the
scholarly literature. To keep the analysis relevant and to stay away
from hyperbolic conclusions, I am grateful to have had the opportunity
to calibrate my findings through discussions with actual operators in
the realm, not least former US Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, General James S. Cartwright.

### OCOCs coordination fail -- lack of information

Military nuclear capabilities

[Due to their enormous destructiveness, nuclear weapons are on many
levels a special category.]{.underline} As such, [NATO treats them
differently. Nuclear weapons and the decision process regarding their
use are strictly national]{.underline} for the three nuclear wielding
NATO- members, the US, UK, and France.

[Nevertheless, general information on nuclear capabilities are
relatively accessible even from unclassified sources]{.underline}
(Kristensen and Korda 2019b, 2019a; Ministry of Defence n.d.). The
potential effects of the weapons and the way their means of delivery
work are also relatively well known. This includes other allies'
relevant capabilities, for example, the German Tornado bombers'
capability to deliver nuclear weapons (Freedman 2013, 15). This allows
NATO to integrate the weapons' potential effects in the planning of the
alliance's military defense and deterrence. The Nuclear Planning Group,
founded in 1966, is the main forum to discuss nuclear issues within NATO
(NATO 2022b).

As Table 1 shows, OCOCs is in a category to itself regarding NATO's
members' will and ability (or rather lack of it) to coordinate these
means through NATO.

[While NATO in principle can handle defensive cyber on par with
conventional means, OCOCs are even less coordinated than nuclear
weapons. Contrary to the other capabil- ities, NATO as an organization
likely has no knowledge of its members' OCOCs, their effects and means
of delivering it. Furthermore, NATO does not coordinate or standar- dize
allies' OCOC development or acquisition or to coordinate their
use]{.underline}, except for the option of providing SCEPVAs through
CyOC.

#### OCOCs require knowledge and prior assessment of assets -- not available under NATO structures

Cyber: a young domain for offensive NATO operations

[While NATO has de facto been involved in defending its member states in
the cyber domain for nearly two decades, it was not until 2016 that NATO
acknowledged cyber as a domain for military operations.]{.underline}
[More than half of NATO's members had publicly declared their intent to
develop offensive cyber means before NATO agreed to develop a capability
to integrate such effects and began to implement a Cyberspace Operations
Center, the CyOC,]{.underline} in October 2018 (Brent 2019; Freedberg
2018; MacKenzie 2017; Smeets 2019).

[NATO's decision to establish the CyOC to integrate offensive cyber
effects in NATO led operations, is a significant and less ambitious
divergence from NATO's normal approach, which would be to coordinate
offensive cyber]{.underline} (Rizwan and Ricks 2017). [Outside the realm
of OCOCs, coordination of military means in NATO operations normally
involves a prior common understanding between allies of the available
cap- abilities for planning purposes.]{.underline} At the strategic
level, NATO must know which means are available to plan the ways the
alliance can achieve the desired ends. At the operational and tactical
level, coordination requires some level of shared command and control as
well as shared information about, e.g., which weapons are used, the
intended targets and the timing of the attacks in order to de-conflict
with other forces engaged in the operation.

[For OCOCs, however, NATO's ambition only amounts to allow their
potential inclusion in an operation, should an ally volunteer
CNA-effects]{.underline}. [No prior knowledge or assessment of available
assets is collected, and no command and control exercised, except for
the permission from NATO to the effect-delivering member state to
execute the CNA]{.underline} (NATO 2020, 21).

[The practical outcome is, which prior to an operation, in principle
NATO staffs at the strategic and operational level will have no
knowledge of what OCOCs are available to base their planning
on.]{.underline} Broadly speaking, [NATO-members will volunteer CNA-
effects as they identify opportunities to support operations during the
operational planning process and as operations are ongoing at the
tactical level.]{.underline} In principle, except for the nation that
delivers the CNA-effect, alliance partners will remain ignorant of, for
example, which software is used, which targets are struck and when the
attacks occur. [Even the efficacy of the CNAs may remain known only to
the member that delivers the effect.]{.underline}

Unclassified information on the internal negotiations in NATO on OCOCs
and the CyOC is not available, but it has probably been difficult to
find common ground between the 29 members NATO had at the time. The
elaborate wording used by the alliance to discuss the topic could
indicate that OCOs were a controversial topic. While Denmark in 2018
pledged willing to provide "cyber weapons" and "offensive cyber effects"
to NATO (Danish Ministry of Defence 2018), NATO has avoided these terms.
Instead NATO have compromised on the rather ungainly term "sovereign
cyber effects, provided voluntarily by Allies," or SCEPVA (Goździewicz
2019).

[Adding to the diplomatic delicateness of the matter to the alliance,
difficulties are exacerbated at the legal level: All NATO-members agree
that international law]{.underline} and the rules of armed conflict
[apply to offensive cyber capabilities and their effects]{.underline}
(NATO 2020, 21). [However, there is no well-established NATO, let alone
international, consensus on interpretation of this in
practice]{.underline} (Taillat 2019, 33; Smeets 2021).

NATO's different approaches to coordination of military means

[A brief comparison of NATO's approach to integrate the effects of OCOs
vis--a-vis conventional military means, nuclear weapons, and defensive
cyber, gives an indication of how the four categories of military means
pose different levels of challenges to their coordination by the
alliance.]{.underline}

Conventional military means

Coordination of the use and deployment of conventional military means
has long been an essential function for NATO, sometimes even influencing
individual member states' acquisitioning or discontinuation of specific
military capabilities. Coordination within NATO allow nations to focus
their military investments on capabilities relevant to the alliance's
plans for defense and deterrence. Hence, during the Cold War when the
main threat was a Soviet invasion, European partners stood up the main
part of NATO's ground forces while the US delivered most of the
strategic power projection capabilities (Shaver and Newland 1989, 12).
Coordinated force development has only increased in importance with the
diminishing emphasis on static territorial defense that followed the
fall of the Soviet Union as members have discontinued entire
capabilities (Ek 2006, 2). A prime example is how Denmark in 2004 gave
up its mobilization based territorial defense, submarines and land-based
air defense -- key capacities for national defense -- in order to focus
on deployable out-of-area capabilities for missions such as the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan
(Forligspartierne 2004, 9,11). On its own website, NATO elevates the
role of "setting goals for national or collective development of
capabilities; and facilitating national, multinational and col- lective
capability development and innovation," done through the NATO Defense
Planning Process, to be a key element in the alliance's two pillars:
Interoperability and modern weapons. Coordination at this level requires
that NATO has a relatively detailed understanding of its members'
military capabilities, especially the capabilities members pledge to
NATO operations, readiness- or response forces. These are evaluated by
NATO to assess whether they fulfil the set requirements ('NATO -- Topic:
NATO's Capabilities' 2020; 'NATO -- Topic: Troop Contributions' 2020).

NATO-coordination of acquisition, deployment of conventional means,
etc., is of course an ideal that has never been fully realized, as
demonstrated, for example, by the Turkish procurement of the Russian
S-400 air defense system in 2019 or the sudden declaration by the United
States in June 2020 that 9.500 troops would be withdrawn from Germany
(Bennhold 2020; Marcus 2019). [However, the strong reactions that
followed these deviations from inter-allied coordination demonstrates
that they are exactly that: deviations from an ingrained policy that
NATO allies have learned to expect from each other over decades of close
cooperation]{.underline} (Oltermann 2020; Pamuk 2019).

Defensive cyber capabilities

[Regarding defensive cyber, most NATO members stood up such
capabilities]{.underline} at the tail end of the 20th century [in
response to the threats]{.underline} that emerged along with the
internet. NATO began considering coordination of defensive cyber
capabilities almost two dec- ades ago in 2002 and demonstrated its
ability to do so during the cyber-attack campaign against Estonia in
2007 (Caton n.d., xi; Tikk et al. 2010, 24). [Acquisition of defensive
cyber capabilities have been uncontroversial for individual members and
NATO alike, both strategically and legally. Today, NATO has developed
both doctrines and organiza- tions to develop a defensive stance in the
cyber domain, with an emphasis on resilience to attain deterrence by
denial rather than punishment]{.underline} (Burton 2015, 309). Within
NATO, [vital elements of defensive cyber such as response teams and
threat information are shared routinely between member
states]{.underline} (NATO 2020). [Standing multilateral organiza- tions
such as NATO's Communications and Information Agency (]{.underline}NCIA)
[and NATO's Computer Incident Response Capability]{.underline} (NCIRC)
work every day [in defense of NATO's own systems]{.underline} (Ali 2014,
33). Thus, [sharing of defensive cyber capabilities and information is
demonstrably possible within the alliance.]{.underline}

### OCOCs fail -- info sharing 

#### OCOCs secrecy required for success effects -- means no info sharing

Five characteristics of offensive cyber that inhibit coordination

[The remaining article will demonstrate why this, for good reasons, is a
particular policy for OCOCs by going through inherent characteristics of
this emerging military capabil- ity. The factors are arguably all
subsets of characteristic #1: they arise from the individual
NATO-members' inclination to keep OCOCs secret at the "National Eyes
Only" level.]{.underline} However, treating characteristic #2--5
individually provides better insights into how they affect NATO. The
identified inhibiting factors are in this analysis taken to their
theore- tical extreme in order to illustrate the argument. Of course,
contextual factors may mitigate the degree to which these
characteristics inhibit coordination. It is likely that the less
advanced and revealing of own capabilities the OCOC in question is, and
the more existential the threat the OCOC is to be deployed against is,
the more likely it is that decision makers will overcome the identified
inhabitations on coordinated use. Also, [the informal but very real
hierarchical relationship between allies, particularly between the US
and the other NATO members, will likely induce individual allies to
share the necessary information in some cases (]{.underline}Walsh 2010,
134--37).

[Characteristic #1: secrecy is a precondition for effect]{.underline}

A conventional weapon can, in principle, be forced through an opponent's
defenses by increasing the amount of attacking platforms and/or the
caliber of the weapon systems deployed if the attacker is willing to
incur the costs. In contrast, [many advanced OCOCs depend on secrecy to
achieve their effect: they can only penetrate an oppo- nent's defense if
it has a flaw of which he is unaware]{.underline} (Libicki 2009, xiii,
18). To slip through an opponent's defenses OCOCs need a technical,
organizational, or procedural vulnerability that the opponent is unaware
of, for example, zero-day vulnerabilities in his software or an item
with internet access installed on the opponents' system with a low
security setting. It could also be physical access to his system that
allows electronic or physical tampering or simply an employee in the
opponent's organization that has been identified as liable to click on
phishing mails of a particular design (Taillat 2019, 370).

Regardless of the nature of the vulnerability, should the opponent
become aware of it, he will be able to address it with relative ease and
at a comparatively low cost. For example, by updating and patching
software or hardware, limiting physical access to systems, changing
passwords on electronic items on the network and training or elim-
inating the above-mentioned careless employee. [Therefore, OCOCs require
a very high degree of operational security to retain their potential
effect, as the slightest hint of their modus of deployment or their
specific targets can render them impotent]{.underline} (Shane et al.
2017; Smith 2013, 83). The fewer who knows -- the better.

[While strict operational security is undoubtedly beneficial to the
deployment of conventional weapons, it is, unlike advanced OCOCs, not a
precondition for their ability to deliver their effect. Hence, due to
the lesser risks from operational security, there is a lower threshold
for sharing knowledge of conventional capabilities between allies, than
for OCOCs.]{.underline}

The limited available information suggests that sharing even non-cyber
related classi- fied information within NATO has been a longstanding
challenge (Atkeson 1984; Binnendijk and Priebe 2019, 50; de Graaff 2017;
Dempsey 2017; G. K. Gramer 1999, ii, 7; Seagle 2015, 565,570).

[While the individual members and their national intelligence services
have long histories of intelligence collection and its use, NATO does
not have a lot of institu- tional experience]{.underline} (Seagle 2015,
565,571). NATO has had a special committee for sharing intelligence
since 1952 but the organization depends on voluntary intelligence
contributions from the members. There was no NATO organization for
intelligence fusing until 2006, when the NATO Intelligence Fusion Center
(NIFC) was stood up. Until then, members could only provide information
by making national assessments releasable to NATO (Gordon 2017; Lefebvre
2003, 531). In 2017, NATO created a second institution, the Joint
Intelligence and Security Division (JISD), for common intelligence
analysis based on voluntary national contributions and open sources to
improve the alliance's common situational awareness (von Loringhoven
2017). Except for a few ground surveillance capabilities and airborne
radars, [NATO has no internal intelligence collection
capabilities]{.underline} (von Loringhoven 2019). NATO is also unrelated
to the Five-eyes, Nine-eyes or Fourteen-eyes communities that allegedly
is the US National Security Agency's unofficial designations for
multilateral agreements of intel- ligence sharing with particularly
trusted partners. With the Five-eyes (US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New
Zealand) being the closest partners, the communities allegedly all
include non-NATO members (MacAskill and Ball 2013; Reveron 2006, 460).

[US concerns of allies' ability to handle sensitive information,
particularly in the cyber domain, was accentuated over NATO members'
potential inclusion of Chinese providers]{.underline}, for example,
Huawei, in their emerging 5 G-networks. US representatives suggested
that inclusion of Chinese information technology in critical
infrastructure would inhibit future intelligence sharing, not only in
NATO but even within the Five-Eyes community (Elmer 2019; R. Gramer and
Seligman 2020; Satariano 2019).

[It is important to realize that states must overcome even more
constraints to share relevant information on advanced OCOCs with allies
than inhibit the delicate business of sharing classified
intelligence]{.underline}. When allies share intelligence, they can do
so in a manner that does not disclose the sources and means by which the
intelligence was developed. An ally can share the information that "the
enemy ship will sail at midnight" without any indication of how this
information was acquired and assessed as valid. Should the ally indicate
the source, this may be a deceptive fabrication to deflect
investigations in the true source. A famous example is how the British
during WW II shared intelligence gathered by breaking the German Enigma
codes, by leading allies to believe that the information had been
collected through networks of spies in Germany (Cox 2014). Even with
these limitations[, sharing of intelligence is a delicate matter between
states and allegedly rarely takes place at a significant level in
multinational organizations such as NATO]{.underline} (Walsh 2010, 14).

As demonstrated above, and further exploited in the following
characteristics below[: In order to give allies a full understanding of
the effects of the use of an OCOC]{.underline} -- both to the enemy and
to themselves -- it is not enough to disclose the desired effect, the
SCEPVA (roughly comparable to the information "The ship will sail at
midnight"). [Allies will need to know technical details regarding the
SCEPVA in order to assess its efficacy, legality, and potential effects
on own OCO.]{.underline}

[Yet not all OCOCs need to be secret at the national eyes
only-level]{.underline}. While STUXNET was a means that reportedly
required sensitive national resources to develop and deploy, some OCOCs
are likely relatively unsophisticated versions of commercially available
malware or conversions from, for example, criminal sources on the dark
web (Falco 2012, 20). In principle, [such mundane OCOCs could be fully
shared and coordinated between allies, as they pose little risk to
sensitive resources and are based on standard tools rather than highly
vulnerable identified flaws in the opponent's systems.]{.underline}
However, [the limited available empirical unclassified
evidence]{.underline}, for example, from U.S. OCOs during Operation
Inherent Resolve against ISIS [suggests that even coordination of
"trivial" OCOCs poses very significant challenges in coalitions due to
high- and perhaps over-classification]{.underline} (Martelle 2020).

[A culture of secrecy, ingrained over centuries in national intelligence
services, may be a contributing factor to over-classification of even
mundane, un-advanced OCOCs]{.underline} (Cartwright 2018). Cyber-enabled
intelligence collection and means for CNA emerged naturally as a task
for intelligence organizations as they expanded their activities from
the electromagnetic spectrum to the Internet. In Britain, the signals
intelligence service, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), is
responsible for OCOCs and has taken credit for OCOs against ISIS
(Flemming 2018). In Denmark, the task of developing OCOCs and conducting
OCOs lies with the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (Forsvarets
Efterretningstjeneste n.d.).

There are excellent reasons for organizational co-location of CNE and
CNA- capabilities[. Besides target selection and identification of
opponents' vulnerabilities, it provides opportunities for synergy within
recruitment, training, and sustainment of the human
resources]{.underline} (Cartwright 2018[). Even when separated, OCOCs
often remain closely linked to the intelligence world: The US Cyber
Command still shares its commanding officer with the National Security
Agency (NSA)]{.underline} -- often jokingly referred to as "No Such
Agency" in reference to its reputation for secrecy (Pomerleau 2018).
[Also legal and constitutional concerns may keep the OCOs closely tied
to the intelligence services, especially when using CNA below the
threshold of armed conflict]{.underline} (Chesney 2019).

Regardless of causes, [mundane OCOCs appear to be generally surrounded
by the same secrecy as advanced or otherwise sensitive
OCOCs]{.underline}. As the young cyber domain matures[, unadvanced OCOCs
may eventually be transferred from national intelligence organiza- tions
to regular military forces and become an everyday part of military
operations on a par with other means (Breuer 2020). The potential
restraining cultural impact of national intelligence organizations on
NATO's ability to share information is, however, a topic for another
article.]{.underline}

Characteristic #2: uncertainty of effects

[OCOCs have several characteristics that make their effects more
uncertain than those of conventional weapons]{.underline}. [This is true
for both their immediate tactical effect and their strategic effect as a
means for conflict management]{.underline}. The effects of conventional
weapons on specific objectives depend on the laws of physics and the
characteristics of the weapon and the target. They are thus well known,
or can be tested in theory or practice by engineers on mathematical
models or physical mock-ups. Also, physical targets change
characteristics slowly over time, and there are often physical
indicators that can be observed from afar -- that is, if an opponent's
command and control bunker gets an additional layer of concrete or new
anti-aircraft weapons are deployed around it.

This is not the case with [advanced OCOCs' effect on their intended
objective]{.underline}s. The specific targets [are unique combinations
of software and hardware that are run by specific operational
procedures]{.underline}. As described above, [any change in software,
hardware, or procedures (e.g. passwords) may render impotent an OCOC
designed to overcome the prior combinations and their identified
vulnerabilities]{.underline}. In addition, changes may not be obviously
apparent to an external observer, who thus will have no warning about
the change. [An attacker can only design his OCOC based on the latest
and best intelligence, until its actual use.]{.underline}

Therefore, [there will always remain a level uncertainty about to which
degree the OCOC will deliver its desired effect,]{.underline} if at all.
[Thus allies, whose conventional military operations may depend on the
successful execution of an ally's CNA]{.underline} (e.g. to temporarily
render air defenses inoperable in order to allow friendly aircraft to
operate in the opponent's airspace) [face a dilemma whether or not to
accept a risk.]{.underline} To assess whether the level of uncertainty
to their planes is acceptable, the allies need comprehensive knowledge
on how the enabling CNA is to be conducted, as well as the available
information on the enemy systems on which the CNA is based (Cartwright
2018). However, as discussed above[, the ally providing the CNA has a
strong incentive not to share this information. This leaves the
CNA-dependant allies either to take the CNA-providing ally's word for
the CNA's efficacy against the enemy's air defenses]{.underline} -- or
to find alternative means to ensure the effect, e.g. a conventional
attack. The likelihood of the latter outcome likely increases with the
potential consequences of failure to the allies depending on the CNA's
effect (Cartwright 2018).

#### Even if some incentives emerge to use OCOCs within NATO, coordination obstacles will continue

The [findings raise the question of how useful OCOCs are to NATO
members]{.underline} -- primarily the smaller members -- [if OCOC's use
within the framework of the alliance potentially requires them to share
more sensitive information with allies than they are comfortable
with]{.underline}. The discussion has so far avoided the obvious fact
that NATO's individual members have different characteristics --
particularly stra- tegic wherewithal -- that influences the level to
which they can expect other members to accept their volunteering of
SCEPVAs. Likewise, [to which degree NATO-members will have to disclose
sensitive information in order to be allowed to provide
SCEPVAs]{.underline}, or can expect forgiveness from other members
should they "go rouge" and conduct CNA without NATO's knowledge or
consent.

[The US has a dominant status within the alliance]{.underline} (Jakobsen
2014, 61; Lake 1999, 171). [This likely raises US expectations of not
having to ask before using SCEPVAs on behalf of NATO or be forgiven if
they do. At the opposite end of the power scale, a small member such as
Denmark would likely hesitate to use OCOCs unilaterally, historically
preferring only to wield military power in coalitions]{.underline}. If
asked formally or informally by the US whether in NATO or indeed in any
coalition of the willing with the US, Denmark would likely also find it
problematic to refuse to disclose sensitive information regarding a
suggested SCEPVA. Not least because the primary effect of the SCEPVA for
Denmark would rarely be the first-order effect on an enemy, but rather
the second-order effect to gain prestige with the US to strengthen the
transatlantic relationship and military guarantee for Denmark's security
(Jakobsen et al. 2016). Such disclosure would be painful though, and
small NATO-members would probably attempt to limit them to the bilateral
level -- likely with the US as the second party.

[However, while NATO's individual members may be expected to generally
try to accommodate US' preferences, there is no automatic
causality]{.underline}. [Choices will vary from case to case based on
the individual member's understanding of risks and
benefits]{.underline}. In the cyber domain, for example Germany's, UK's
and Denmark's initial reluctance to deny Huawei access to their
telecommunication infrastructure are examples of NATO-allies that weigh
other issues higher than US requests (Barnes and Satariano n.d.; R.
Gramer and Seligman 2020; Mouritzen 2020; D.E. Sanger et al. 2020).

Conclusion: the SCEPVA-doctrine is a pragmatic mitigation of OCOCs'
dilemmas

This article has explored the question of the degree to which the
outlined char- acteristics of OCOCs inhibit NATO's ability to coordinate
them.

Today, [most NATO members consider integration of OCOCs in their
military operations]{.underline}. As demonstrated[, NATO's members have
legitimate national interests in shrouding these capabilities in
secrecy. Apparently, this currently makes sharing and coordination of
OCOCs an insurmountable challenge for NATO.]{.underline}

However, this analysis has taken the outlined difficulties of
coordinating OCOCs to their theoretical extremes. To invoke Clausewitz,
war -- including CNA -- is never an isolated act and extremes are
moderated by external factors (Clausewitz 1918, 27). Hence, real-world
inhibitions to share information will likely be moderated by several
factors.

[The threshold for willingness to share information on CNA or accept
risks from allies' offered SCEPVAs may remain constant, but the
incentive to overcome it likely varies with the external threats to the
alliance.]{.underline} All other things being equal, NATO members'
willingness to share information will likely rise with the severity of a
crisis at hand, facilitating the use of SCEPVAs and perhaps paving the
way for more ambitious coordination. Prior to 2022, the external
pressure on NATO was relatively low. The Russian attack on Ukraine in
February 2022 demonstrably infused NATO's members with a renewed sense
of urgency and set in motion alliance-strengthening initiatives, such as
increased military spending and forward deployments of troops and
materiel (Shapiro 2020; Detsch and Gramer 2022). Possibly, the same
sense of urgency has increased the willingness to share infor- mation or
accept risks if NATO should request the members to provide effects
through CNA.

Also, as the cyber domain matures, the willingness to share could become
more dependent on the level of intelligence assets and cyber
capabilities at risk -- that is, dependant on how advanced and
specifically tailored the OCOCs in question are. As stated above some
means are very sensitive, some are more mundane. However, currently most
OCOCs appear to be highly classified regardless of their actual
sensitivity, meaning that the NATO-members' willingness to share is
lower than the actual means themselves justify. As military use of OCOCs
matures over time in the sense that it becomes more ingrained in
everyday operations and moves partly out of its current realm of top
secret, national eyes only-classification, may NATO become able to
coordinate some of its member's OCOCs.

[Regardless, due to the inherent characteristics of cyber weaponry, the
member states' advanced OCOCs means will likely remain outside NATO
coordination. At some point, some NATO members will likely conduct CNAs
without coordination with allies or perhaps limit the coordination to
bilateral consultations between the CNA-conducting ally and NATO's
dominant member, the US.]{.underline}

Added to the resulting insecurity and ambiguity comes the lack of human
experience at the present point in history. [The general strategic
effect of offensive cyber capabilities on the international system in
peace, crisis and war is presently only beginning to be
understood]{.underline}. Hence, [their use as a means for controlling
escalation in crisis and war is to a large degree a question of
assumptions and educated guesses on behalf of a potential
attacker.]{.underline} [This makes the use of OCOCs as signals to an
opponent in a crisis even more uncertain than signaling with tradi-
tional military means and hence escalation harder to
control]{.underline} (Cavaiola et al. 2015, 89; Nye and Joseph 2016,
49). Again[, these factors are exacerbated by the incentive to keep OCOs
secret from allies and the uncertainty of the actual effect of a
CNA.]{.underline} While the effects following from characteristic #2 --
uncertainty of efficacy and unintended effects caused by the secrecy
surrounding allies' OCOCs -- is not an argument against collaboration
amongst allies[, it is a strong incentive for NATO-allies to prefer
conventional alternatives to SCEPVAs in NATO operations.]{.underline}

#### Risk of escalation creates obstacles to allies' participation -- and international legal uncertainty decreases participation because NATO members differ in their interp of legal use of OCOCs

In addition to the uncertainty on whether contributed CNAs will have
less than the desired effect, [there will sometimes be uncertainty
whether the CNA will have more than the desired effect, either directly
or as collateral damage]{.underline}. [The CNA may have undesirable
effects, perhaps by effecting third parties, by being unintentionally
escalatory or by delivering effects that are debatable according to
international law.]{.underline} Again, [allies to a state that conducts
CNAs must have knowledge of the deployed OCOCs and the targets to assess
its effects]{.underline}. [Their alternative is to take their ally's
word that they will not be participating in operations involving legally
questionable or plainly counterproduc- tive OCO]{.underline}.

[Legal issues is]{.underline} a more [pronounced problem with
CNAs]{.underline} than with conventional means, [as there are no
internationally agreed upon interpretation on what constitutes the legal
use of CNAs]{.underline} in international conflict, [not even within
NATO]{.underline}. As stated above, [SCEPVAs need to be legal according
to the delivering ally's interpretation of International
Law]{.underline} (NATO 2020, 21) -- [but this may differ from other
NATO-members', opening up an assortment of legal problems in case NATO
decides to use CNAs]{.underline} (Taillat 2019, 373; Jacobsen and Jeppe
2017, 7; Smeets 2021, 3). [Even though disputable legal effects of a
SCEPVA will formally be the responsibility of the executing member,
other members of NATO may be held responsible at the political and
strategic level.]{.underline} Having noted [this very serious
inhibition]{.underline}, legal aspects of coordinated use of OCOCs in
NATO will not be developed further here.

Characteristic #3: conflicting priorities between offensive cyber
effects and cyber espionage

[The vulnerabilities exploited when conducting CNA may well be the same
vulnerabilities that are used to conduct CNE.]{.underline} Successful
and continuous intelligence collection depends on discretion and the
target of the collection being unaware of the vulnerability exploited.
[A CNA conducted via such a vulnerability will likely draw the
opponents' attention and eventually result in its discovery and
elimination. This will render future intelligence collection from that
venue impossible]{.underline}. Thus[, there can be a conflict of
interest between "cyber spies" and "cyber warriors" that has to be
de-conflicted before a CNA is carried out.]{.underline} This inherent
need to decide which is more important, immediate CNA-effects or future
intelligence collection opportunities, is probably one of the reasons
why the US Command for Military Cyber Operations, and NSA, the
intelligence service responsible for technical collection, still have a
common commanding officer after years of con- templation of separating
the two institutions (DoD n.d.). By having the same person in charge of
both CNA and CNE, the competing priorities can be decided within the
same organizational framework with full knowledge of the technical and
tactical details required to make a full assessment of the effects and
risks involved. Even so, the [limited available information on
historical OCO suggests that inter-organizational de-confliction just
within the US is problematic]{.underline} (Loleski 2019, 123; USCYBERCOM
2016).

[It is reasonable to assume that the added layer of complexity of
de-conflicting use of identified flaws in the opponent's systems with
allies is even more problematic than sharing other SCEPVA-related
information.]{.underline} Such [de-confliction may include detailed
disclosures of highly sensitive means]{.underline}, methods and
operations regarding both CNA and CNE [capabilities]{.underline}.
Hence[, this will be very difficult to carry out on a bilateral basis,
let alone in a multilateral alliance.]{.underline} [To de-conflict
SCEPVAs, allies may have to disclose highly sensitive information to
other alliance members -- which they will have a strong inclination
agains]{.underline}t. NATO has, as mentioned earlier, reportedly had
challenges sharing intelligence. [This suggests that the more likely
outcome is that de-confliction will be omitted, and NATO allies will
have to accept the risk that a SCEPVA could shut down some of their
intelligence collection sources.]{.underline} Intelligence collection
means, technical and otherwise, are the crown jewels of intelligence
services, and while the collected informa- tion or intelligence-based
thereon occasionally is shared, means are kept secret from friends as
well as foes. As is the case with the other inhibitions to coordination
derived from over-classification of mundane OCOCs along with the actual
tailored means, this hindrance could be lessened if NATO members
distinguished between the two sorts and treated them differently
(Cartwright 2018).

### OCOCs -- burning OCOCs disincentive 

#### Limited investment in OCOCs -- no incentive to prioritize sharing effects that burn ococs for future use

Characteristic #4: competing priorities for the use of an offensive
cyber capability

[Once developed, conventional weapons,]{.underline} e.g. bombs, of the
same model [can be used again]{.underline} and again [until they become
obsolete.]{.underline} In contrast, [advanced OCOCs can only achieve
effects until the vulnerability they exploit is eliminated,]{.underline}
which, as described above, [is likely to happen shortly after it is
exposed]{.underline} (Smeets 2018a, 16). Hence, [advanced OCOCs are in
some sense not re-usable or at least highly ephemeral, once
deployed.]{.underline}

[Bearing this characteristic in mind, consider that allies, who possess
OCOCs utilizing the same identified vulnerability, may have different
priorities regarding which targets to use the capability
against.]{.underline} As was the case with de-confliction of
intelligence collection versus CNA, [de-confliction in alliances of
target priorities when "burning" OCOCs and disclosing the opponent's
vulnerabilities with CNAs will require sharing highly sensitive
information]{.underline}. [This will very likely inhibit the
de-confliction process.]{.underline} Alternatively, [allies must accept
the use of OCOCs without this knowledge]{.underline}, [accepting the
risk of some of their own arsenal of OCOCs becoming obsolete, as the
capabilities will likely become impotent shortly after their first
use.]{.underline}

### OCOCs bad -- reuse against US and allies

#### OCOCs once used and info about effects shared risk reuse by adversaries and criminals against allies -- decreases incentives to share cyber effects and OCOCs

Characteristic #5: Risk of offensive cyber means being used against
allies and third parties

However[, OCOCs are re-useable in ways that conventional munitions are
not.]{.underline} [After a bomb dropped on an opponent detonates, the
opponent]{.underline} can't pick it up, perhaps re- engineer it, [copy
the bomb or its new versions endlessly and then use it against the
original attacker, his allies or third parties]{.underline} -- or sell
it to criminals at the dark web. [With some OCOCs, you can.
In]{.underline} some cases, [a victim of a CNA will be able to find,
extract and re- engineer the malware and potentially use it
against]{.underline}, for example[, the original attacker, its allies,
or third parties outside the current conflic]{.underline}t (Taillat
2019, 375). To give a famous example, the US and Israel allegedly
deployed STUXNET in 2009--10 as a CNA to sabotage of Iranian
centrifuges. By September 2010 elements of the software had already been
adapted by criminals and used to attack third parties (Falco 2012,
33--34). The same is the case when OCOCs are lost or stolen. Sometime
[in or before 2013, a number of OCOCs]{.underline} [developed by the
NSA's]{.underline} hacking group, Tailored Access Operations, was lost
(Shane et al. 2017). Regardless whether this was due to external state
sponsored CNE or an insider attack along the lines of the
2013-Snowden-breach, the lost OCOCs have since been [used against
targets in the US, NATO allies, and third parties]{.underline}, for
example, Ukraine in different guises. Russia conducted the 2017 NotPetya
CNA on critical economical infrastructure in Ukraine based on flaws
identified in the tools lost by NSA. It spread uncontrollably to other
countries and caused damage to civilian companies in the west for more
than 800 million USD (UK NCSC 2018). Prior to that, in 2016, North Korea
used them for extortion attempts in the Wannacry CNA that infamously
paralyzed several British hospitals for days and caused costly
disruptions in many other countries (Shane et al. 2017). Iran has also
been identified as a likely user of the lost OCOCs (Symantec 2018).
Lately, criminals have used the tools to disrupt and degrade entire
cities' informational infrastructure and holding municipalities for
ransom, for example, in Baltimore, which suffered the effects of such an
attack for months in 2019 (Perlroth and Shane 2019).

Hence, by conducting a CNA[, an alliance member will let loose an OCOC
on the Internet for all to eventually find and examine.]{.underline}
[This may eventually add the means or redesigned versions of it to
opponents' cyber arsenals,]{.underline} as well as the arsenals of
capable non-state actors, such as criminals (Robinson et al. 2015, 81).
Thus[, as part of the alliance's coordination efforts the CNA-providing
ally should consider warning allies and perhaps even third parties, for
example, about which means have been used or which vulnerabilities have
been exploited]{.underline} (Baram 2018). [However, again the tactical
value of keeping details about OCOCs and identified flaws in software
classified will provide a strong incentive against such
coordination.]{.underline} For example US authorities waited years to
warn US entities in 2017 and 2019, respectively, of security flaws that
were left vulnerable after the CIA lost control of a number of OCOCs in
2016 (Wyden 2020).

[The uncertainties regarding the potential technical and tactical
efficacy of SCEPVAs are increased by the fact that collection of
intelligence on potential targets has to be done in a discreet,
preferably clandestine, manner.]{.underline} This is in order not to
alert the opponent and cause him to take actions, for example, implement
technical changes that may render the CNA under preparation impotent
(Cavaiola et al. 2015, 87). [The necessary collection of intelligence to
prepare tailored CNA may involve highly classified national means,
methods, and capabilities]{.underline}. [These could be jeopar- dized by
sharing information on the intended OCOCs or CNA-targets with
allies]{.underline}. Along with the need for operational security and
secrecy described above, [this risk to intelligence capabilities further
constrains an ally's incentive to share information on OCOCs with
alliance partners.]{.underline}

As a strategic means, [OCOCs are in some regards more challenging as
means of escalation control and crisis management for alliances than
conventional means. One major difference is the ambiguous nature of
CNA.]{.underline} Unlike conventional weapons, [CNA will always leave
the victim of the attack in some level of uncertainty regarding attribu-
tion, and whether it has realized all the ways in which it has been
attacked]{.underline} (Libicki 2009, 92; Rid and Buchanan 2015, 11). The
US initial reactions to the Solar Winds attack, attributed tentatively
to Russian intelligence, provide ample evidence of the insecurity that
follows the discovery of a deep penetration of critical systems (Fireye
2020; David E. Sanger and Perlroth 2020).

Executive Summary

• [As sectors continue to grow more dependent on data flows,
cybersecurity threats are becoming a bigger priority for the United
States and the European Union (EU]{.underline}). Preventing
cybersecurity breaches is becoming increasingly important to critical
sectors and critical functions across the transatlantic.

• [Data governance frameworks between the United States and the EU
diverge significantly, with fundamental differences in approaches to
data architecture, data protection, law enforcement data sharing, cyber
interventions, and cybersecurity frameworks]{.underline}.

• [Differences in data governance lead to growing cybersecurity risks in
the transatlantic, caused by different cybersecurity risk assessments,
cybersecurity incident reporting standards, and information sharing
networks]{.underline}.

• [The Baltic approach ensures that all cybersecurity information
funnels through a forum]{.underline} of all relevant public, private,
military, and civilian sector stakeholders.

• [By establishing an international cybersecurity council for critical
functions, the United States and the EU set a shared scope for threat
collection, and a forum for sharing threats]{.underline}.

• [Cybersecurity coordination should be advanced as a priority under the
U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council working]{.underline} groups.

• [Civilian and military cybersecurity expertise and capacity should be
conflated. The EU proposal for a Joint Cyber Unit would establish a unit
that can become a European representative to the United
States.]{.underline}

This article has pointed to [several challenges to the integration of
military cyber effects in NATO operations, and has argued that even if
the integration is successful, it will not add to the alliance's
deterrence posture.]{.underline} Importantly, [the fact that CYOC does
not send a strong signal to adversaries such as Russia does not mean
that it is a waste of time]{.underline}. Far from it. [As both
conventional militaries and paramilitary groups are increasingly
dependent on civilian networked technolo- gies, the ability of NATO to
disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy enemy networks through sovereign cyber
effects---even if these amount only to temporary annoy- ances---will
become more relevant in the years to come]{.underline}. This, of course,
does not mean that conventional kinetic or electromagnetic capabilities
will become redun- dant. Rather, [cyber effects offer a substitute in
case the intended target cannot be reached with conventional
capabilities, and a supplement that works alongside conventional
operations as persistent annoyances of enemy networked
devices]{.underline}. [The latter, however, demands an agile CYOC that
provides member states with broad initial mandates and facilitates quick
decision-making and rapid approval when member states stand ready to
deliver even minor cyber annoyances.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the article has argued that [NATO and its CYOC should not
seek to coordinate additional offensive cyber efforts to deter hybrid
activities below the threshold of armed conflict]{.underline}. [If an
organization that is perceived by its main adversary primarily as a
military organization engages in active cyber-defence measures and
persistent cyber engagements outside of military confrontation, then the
risk of escalation increases]{.underline}. [This is because every
potential NATO-initi- ated cyber activity in foreign networks is likely
to be perceived through a military lens and thus to be (mis-)interpreted
as an attack in the making]{.underline}. In fact, active cyber-defence
measures in foreign networks and use of cyber means below the threshold
of armed conflict to pursue political interests internationally are part
of our current reality. Intelligence agencies know this to be a fact,
and they live by it every day.

#### NATO ineffective cyber deterrent and increased focus on cyberspace undermines intelligence norms necessary for de-escalation

Deterring cyber activity below the threshold of collective defence

['Hybrid' has become a popular concept when describing the current
threat environm]{.underline}ent. While discussions over the definition,
novelty and usefulness of the concept continue, there seems to be
[agreement that, when used to qualify 'threat' or 'warfare', 'hybrid'
refers to the blurring of the distinction between military and civilian,
often in relation to the mixture of instruments used to obtain political
objectives.]{.underline}62 NATO's attempt to deter military and
paramilitary instruments from being deployed has already been touched
upon above. [As a primarily military alliance, however, NATO is facing
difficulty in addressing the instruments that are used deliberately to
stay below the threshold of collective defence.]{.underline}

[NATO has not been able to deter the perpetration of random ransomware
incidents, election interference and targeted propaganda campaigns
through hacks and leaks, or industrial cyber espionage and intrusion
into critical infrastructures. The alliance's conventional capabilities
are not credible (proportional) responses to such malicious cyber
activity]{.underline}. Thus, [it has responded only by 'naming and
shaming]{.underline}', and by expressing [encouragemen]{.underline}t to
[member states to enhance the resil- ience]{.underline} of their
networks.63 These [responses, however, have yet to prove effective in
halting the malicious cyber activity conducted below the threshold of
collec- tive defence]{.underline}.64 And the introduction of SCEPVA is
not likely to change that; [the integration of cyber effects is tied to
NATO military operations only]{.underline}. While NATO member states are
already compelled to maintain a level of cooperation in collective
defence (article 3), and to consult together whenever any of them feels
that its territorial integrity, political independence or security is
threatened (article 4), [NATO---with or without integrated cyber
effects---is not an alliance designed to deal with non-military threats
from a peer competitor]{.underline}.

The question then arises: does the lack of capacity to deter
non-military hybrid cyber activities suggest that it is time for NATO to
renegotiate the scope and substance of its collective defence clause?65
When it comes to cyberspace, the next section expresses scepticism about
expanding NATO's role. It addresses the escala- tion risk associated
with having NATO, an organization that has refocused its attention on a
more traditional military threat, become a more active player below the
threshold of collective defence. [It argues that a more active stance
outside military confrontation risks undermining the intelligence norm
that currently dominates in cyberspace---a norm whereby state activity
in foreign networks is not considered escalatory.]{.underline}

### Escalation net benefit - NATO cyber offense specific 

#### NATO integration of offensive cyber doesn't solve deterrence and increases risk of escalation

\*SCEPVA -- sovereign cyber effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies

\* CYOC - Cyberspace Operation Centre

The article makes three arguments in support of the overall argument
that [NATO will (and should) continue to play only a limited offensive
role in cyber- space]{.underline}. First, it [identifies four distinct
cyber effects]{.underline} [from the current debates on major cyber
incidents]{.underline} presented in the cyber-conflict literature. This
is done in order [to assess the operational challenges and possibilities
for successful integra- tion of sovereign cyber effects in NATO
operations]{.underline}, also known as SCEPVA.8 [As cyber effects are
often costly in time and resources to develop, difficult to predict and
verify, and involve a risk of confliction, it is argued that the types
of offensive cyber operations that are highly destructive and
specialized]{.underline}, [with a view to enabling other (kinetic)
military effects, are the most difficult to integrate]{.underline}. In
contrast, less complex disruptions used to persistently annoy and
confuse adversaries hold more promise. [In order to work in NATO, these
effects require more flexibility in the way CYOC sends requests to and
interacts with the member states.]{.underline}

Second, in the light of the renewed scholarly attention being given to
NATO's capacity to deter Russia, the [article unpacks and
assesses]{.underline} the [suggestion]{.underline} [that a centre for
integrating offensive cyber effects contributes to NATO's deterrence
posture]{.underline}.9 It assesses the [addition of cyber effects to
NATO's operational toolbox]{.underline} in the light of the (hybrid)
threat environment which is currently being articulated in NATO, and
argues that such integration [adds little to the existing deterrence
posture.]{.underline} [NATO's superior conventional capabilities---with
or without cyber effects---already threaten punishment to adversaries
who may consider invading allied countries.]{.underline} Yet [CYOC and
the alliance as a whole do not deter the more frequent (hybrid) cyber
activity against member states that does not reach the threshold of
armed conflict.]{.underline}

To elaborate on this argument, the article addresses, thirdly, the
question of misinterpretation and escalation in cyberspace. Despite
being potentially counter- intuitive to those scholars who advocate a
stronger NATO deterrence posture, [the limited offensive role of NATO in
cyberspace and the alliance's inability to deter the majority of
malicious cyber activity against member states is not necessarily a
problem.]{.underline} In fact, the article argues that [the reason why
we have yet to experi- ence serious misinterpretation in cyberspace is
that most states' cyber activities seem implicitly to accept an
intelligence norm in cyberspace that embraces acting in legal grey zones
and staying under the threshold of armed conflict.]{.underline} [This
norm has offered an additional option on the escalation ladder below
armed attack, but its continuation is contingent on an intelligence
logic]{.underline}---and not a military logic---[being the dominant way
of thinking in cyberspace]{.underline}. As the current strategic
adaptation represents a return to a more conventional military way of
thinking, [NATO's move to present a dominant military force in
cyberspace risks under- mining the status quo---which, so far, has
avoided rapid escalation.]{.underline}

IN IT TOGETHER

[It may be easy, and perhaps natural, for the would-be architects of the
new system to organize it around Washington]{.underline}. [But that
would be a mistake]{.underline}. The [enemies of this new
order]{.underline}, [united by their resentment of the United States,
will seek to discredit it]{.underline} as just another effort to
dominate global affairs. For this new order to be viable, it must be
conceived in such a way that the charge is false.

[The new order must also be decentralized to be effective; the resources
and wisdom needed to solve many vexing problems are not concentrated in
the United States]{.underline}. For instance, [on the enormous issue of
defining rules for a digitized world, Washington has been confused and
passive, despite---or perhaps because of---its dominance in such
commerce]{.underline}. It is [the European Union that has
led]{.underline} the way. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation,
its Digital Services Act, and its Digital Markets Act created the
standards that influence most of the world, including the Americas.
[Decentralized leadership has also proved critical to responding to
Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The nucleus of the emerging pro-Ukraine
coalition]{.underline}, for instance, [is not just the United States but
the entire G-7]{.underline}, including the European Commission. South
Korea and Australia should be invited to join this coalition as well.

## US unilateral/Cyber Command

[The large overlap between intelligence collection and attack in
cyberspace makes it difficult to send clear signals to adversaries, in
terms of either capabilities or intentions.]{.underline} When a foreign
entity is moving around in a network, is it then about to start a
military operation? Is the activity part of a reconnaissance mission? Is
it political or economic espionage? Is it active defence? The difficulty
of answering these questions has created much nervousness among
cyber-conflict experts. Ben Buchanan, for example, has shown how
[defensive hacking or intelligence-gather-ing in cyberspace is easily
misinterpreted as aggressive behaviour.]{.underline}66 [Why, then, have
we not experienced serious misinterpretation and escalation in
cyberspace?]{.underline}

[One way to explain this is through the existence and dominance of a
largely unspoken but widely accepted norm]{.underline}. For decades,
[the predominant actors in cyberspace have been intelligence
agencies]{.underline}; and the [norms that characterize inter- actions
between intelligence agencies are not primarily concerned with military
concepts such as conflict escalation and deterrence]{.underline}.67 In
the world of intelligence agencies, [success is not about keeping a
distance between oneself and the adversary by signalling one's
intentions and capabilities]{.underline}. It is about being able to
outma- noeuvre adversaries in a space of constant contact.68 There are
always risks, and the [work usually takes place in legal grey zones
where a clear distinction between war and peace is not the guiding
principle.]{.underline} [This is an arena where the opportunity to
annoy, cheat and delay opponents is taken when it arises. **In short,
espionage and counter-espionage do not fit well with the thorough
military operational planning that characterizes NATO
operations**]{.underline}. [Intelligence operations, on the other hand,
fit perfectly with a dynamic cyberspace where anonymity is easy to
achieve and uncertainty a constant condition]{.underline}.69 [The states
that embrace cyber- space as a domain where the intelligence norm
dominates are able to use a broader array of tools to pursue or respond
to various foreign political objectives than only those that relate to
military operations.]{.underline}

In its 2018 'vision', the [US Cyber Command built implicitly on the
dominant intelligence norm]{.underline}. Here, [the objective is to
become more agile and act as close to the adversary as possible ('defend
forward').]{.underline}70 The United States considers 'constant contact'
and 'persistent engagement' as the necessary guiding principles to
achieve superiority in cyberspace and to take full advantage of the
broader potential for pursuing its political objectives through
cyberspace[. During the 2018 US midterm elections, for example, the US
Cyber Command worked closely with the NSA to disrupt servers operated by
the Russian Internet Research Agency]{.underline} aiming to spread fake
news and stir up tension in the United States.71 More recently, the US
Cyber Command responded with various cyber effects against Iran after
the Iranian Revolutionary Guards apparently placed mines on ships in the
Strait of Hormuz.72 [These practices illustrate that, for the United
States, cyber effects provide political options when one does not want
to escalate existing tensions into military confrontation]{.underline}.
[Defensive coordination between allies through CYOC supports such
defensive use of cyber effects, increasing the possibility that US Cyber
Command will be allowed to 'defend forward' and work persistently
through allied networks]{.underline}.[73 A more cyber-active NATO,
however, risks being counterproductive to the ambition to 'defend
forward' through allied networks]{.underline}.

[Unintended conflict escalation from ongoing cyber activity is mainly a
risk if military analysts]{.underline}---in a strategic environment with
heightened attention to military confrontation---[ignore the dominant
intelligence norm. If that happens, it becomes more likely that
'persistent engagement' and active cyber defence will be misinterpreted
as military preparation, armament or the initial phase of an attack**.
If NATO, an organization that has publicly returned to its original
raison d'être of deterrence and collective defence, becomes the entity
that coordinates cyber effects below the threshold of armed conflict,
then the likelihood increases that Russia misinterprets these effects as
escalatory and acts accordingly. In other words, a more active NATO in
the current strategic environment increases the risk that the existing
intelligence norm will be undermined and replaced by a more militarized
norm.**]{.underline}

This does not mean that states that face hostile hybrid activities below
the threshold of armed conflict will be left alone[. Intelligence
cooperation between allied countries does exist, and threat information
is occasionally shared]{.underline}. [In addition to the current
political collaboration facilitated by NATO to improve network security
and resilience, the EU is engaging in similar civilian activities, as
well as developing and implementing a cyber-diplomatic toolbox to create
a common basis for responding to a variety of malicious activities
against member states]{.underline}. [Further strengthening the political
partnership between the EU and NATO is thus the most appropriate way
forward to avoid further militarization of cyber- space.]{.underline}

[Sustaining the intelligence norm as the dominant norm is not without
potential problems]{.underline}. Openly embracing the fact that
cyberspace is a domain in which intel- ligence agencies are constrained
only by domestic laws, and where takedowns of servers in foreign
countries are not necessarily perceived as serious breaches of
sovereignty, is likely to lead to an increase in the exploitation of IT
vulnerabili- ties in commercial software used in both enemy and allied
networks. For smaller states, this could increase the risk of
retaliation by larger adversaries, and it c[ould increase the risk of
divisions between allies---divisions that are not aligned with the
United States' political ambition to use cyber coordination in NATO as
part of its attempt to 'defend forward'.]{.underline}74 [More
exploitation could also ultimately make cyberspace less free, less open
and less secure, rendering civilian populations more susceptible to
cybercrime, surveillance and disruptions of everyday
services.]{.underline}75 This is why [some states, NGOs and private
corporations such as Microsoft continue to promote norms that emphasize
restraint on the part of states' intelligence agencies and militaries in
cyberspace, and why other states promote more sovereign control of
cyberspac]{.underline}e.76

Finally, there are also policy implications for the United States. [In
gen- eral, policymakers should more systematically consider how to
incorporate cyber operations into crisis-management plans and strategy,
and further improve communication channels and infrastructure regarding
cyber con- tingencies]{.underline}. Establishing or strengthening
bilateral confidence-building meas- ures with rival states (especially
lines of communication) could enable leaders to privately communicate
about cyber operations, enhancing the US government's ability to send
clearer signals and couple action with direct, private messages.139 For
example, in 2013 the United States and Russia agreed that the hotline
established during the Cold War to communicate about nuclear crises, the
Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, could also be used for cyber
contingencies.140 During Russia's interference in the 2016 US elec-
tions, President Obama used the hotline to communicate with Moscow,
reportedly to deter Russia from directly interfering in the election
out- come.141 [The United States lacks a comparable hotline with China
to com- municate about cyber or other incidents;]{.underline} as of this
writing, [the US military held its first talks with Chinese counterparts
on this topic during the Biden administration.142 US policymakers should
continue to pursue efforts to establish formal lines of communication
or, at a minimum, points of con- tact to facilitate communication around
cyber incidents during crises.]{.underline}

Additionally[, in 2018 US military posture in cyberspace shifted toward
a more active operational presence, epitomized in the Department of
Defense and Cyber Command concepts of "defend forward" and "persistent
engagement," respectively]{.underline}.143 However, [it is unclear
whether policymakers have systematically assessed how US cyber
operations, particularly during times of crisis, map onto a broader
signaling strategy.]{.underline} For instance, during the 2018 effort to
protect the US midterm elections from cyber interfer- ence, it was
reported that US cyber operations were coupled with private
communications to Russia, including US Cyber Command sending direct
(private) messages to Russian operatives.144 [Especially in a context in
which approval for cyber operations may be delegated down the chain of
com- mand,145 there is a risk that operational activity may be
mismatched with broader strategic objectives, raising concerns about
strategic disintegration or the various arms of government operating at
cross-purposes. Therefore, policymakers should take a more deliberate
approach to cyber operations' different uses for signaling purposes and
build more institutionalized mech- anisms for communicating with
adversaries during times of crisis---espe- cially for accommodative
purposes or to ratchet down tensions---so that signals are neither lost
in the noise nor misinterpreted.]{.underline}

The Biden administration has been commendable in clearly and
consistently communicating to Russia, and other audiences, what the
United States will not do in the Ukraine crisis --- like sending
American forces to Ukraine or establishing a no-fly zone. In addition,
the administration should be equally clear about what is off the table
in cyberspace --- what Jacquelyn Schneider has termed a "strategic
no-first-use" policy in cyberspace. Specifically, the United States
should unequivocally convey to Russia that it will refrain from taking
actions in cyberspace during this crisis that would undermine nuclear
stability, such as conducting disruptive cyber-attacks against early
warning satellites. This is different --- the opposite, in fact --- from
drawing "red lines" in cyberspace, which are meant to deter unwanted
behavior but can often backfire. Instead, the United States should
communicate where it will exhibit restraint in cyber operations --- a
form of confidence-building. This could be conveyed publicly through
statements by administration officials, similar to statements that Biden
has made about other aspects of America's role in Ukraine. It could also
be privately communicated through ongoing backchannels taking place
between U.S. allies, like France, and Russia.

There are also policy implications beyond the Ukraine conflict,
especially in an environment in which the United States confronts
potential future crises with other nuclear powers. In particular, senior
national security officials have repeatedly emphasized that China
represents a "pacing challenge" for the United States, including across
the nuclear and cyber realms. In fact, Gen. Nakasone recently announced
the creation of a China Outcomes Group under Cyber Command and the NSA.
And researchers have identified how hypothetical crises involving the
United States and China could escalate along dangerous trajectories,
including to the use of nuclear weapons. The consequences of
misunderstanding the utility of cyber signaling in this area are
significant. Therefore, policymakers must consider how to improve
civil-military coordination and cohesion so that the employment of
military cyber power --- especially when used against sensitive
adversary systems, particularly nuclear ones, during delicate periods
--- is not out of sync with strategic objectives. The United States
should also develop a more robust effort to clarify to adversaries,
including China, how it will constrain its own behavior in cyberspace
specifically during nuclear crises. The potential implications of
misperceptions surrounding cyber operations targeting nuclear systems
during a future crisis with a nuclear-armed adversary are simply too
significant.

countries in Europe and deliverable by dual-capable aircraft. [The
United States and NATO can enhance their impact by changing the Nuclear
Posture Review and the Deterrence and Defence Posture Review to stress
that they reserve the ability to use nuclear weapons first]{.underline}.
In addition, [the aircraft units assigned to carry NATO's nuclear
weapons can hold more exercises to emphasize the operational readiness
of those forces]{.underline}. [If an attack by Russia looks imminent,
the United States, in consultation with NATO allies, can put those
forces on alert]{.underline}. [The goal of these steps by the United
States and NATO would be to emphasize to Russia the nuclear implications
of an attack on a NATO country without taking steps that could cross a
Russian "red line" and provoke it.]{.underline}

What is important here is not making sure that NATO has more tactical
nuclear warheads than Russia or that they are able to stop a Russian
advance on their own. [NATO's nuclear weapons would primarily have a
political effect: threatening a breach of the nuclear
threshold.]{.underline} [The current arsenal of around 130 tactical
nuclear weapons should be sufficient for that task.]{.underline}

Such an asymmetric escalation strategy is not ideal and carries great
risks, but it is a product of past decisions to expand NATO without
first developing real plans for the defense of new members. [NATO
expansion came at a time when policymakers assumed that the risk of war
in Europe was low and thus did not have to think about the dynamics of
great power war or escalation.]{.underline} Putin has disabused Western
leaders of their naïveté and in the process shown himself to be
aggressive and risk-acceptant in the pursuit of ambitious goals.

technologies ([EDTs]{.underline}). [Each receives their due in the
strategic concept]{.underline}: after Russia, they are the first

[The most eye-catching may be cyber and hybrid threats, which "could
lead the North Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5." The commitment to
resilience is also pertinent]{.underline}. On EDTs, NATO announced a new
innovation fund to complement the "DIANA" initiative launched in April.
The concept language on climate change was also ambitious: "NATO should
become the leading international organisation when it comes to
understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on security."

[During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for more security in the digital
world has  heightened]{.underline}. Because of the increased online
presence, requested to preserve human social and  professional
relations, new opportunities emerged for cybercriminals who targeted the
online  commerce and financial tools, as well as the healthcare
system.  

The EU High Representative Josep Borrell, in April and the NAC, on 3
June 2020,  condemned the destabilizing and malicious cyber activities
performed in the context of the  coronavirus pandemic (Statement by the
North Atlantic Council concerning malicious cyber activities  2020).
[NATO statement expressed the solidarity and mutual support for those
affected by malicious  cyber activities, including healthcare services,
hospitals and research institutes. The statement also  requested the
respect for international law and norms of responsible state behavior in
cyberspace  after disinformation campaigns conducted from China or
Russia flooded Western media]{.underline} and social  networks. 

The [limited military cyberspace resources have to be employed
carefully, only in the  necessary areas otherwise the Internet could
easily absorb entire cyber capabilities. The military  activities have
to remain limited in the cyberspace, targeting only specific areas of
interests]{.underline}. The  largest part of cyber activities is
performed and controlled by private entities in both EU and US, and 
[all allied operations and missions have some degree of reliance on
civilian government or private  industry, mainly in the field of
communications infrastructure, logistics, equipment, or host nation 
critical national infrastructure]{.underline}. 

[Alexander Glenn, senior research for NATO and Cyber policy, identified
four major  cyberspace activities related to the military: intelligence,
information, crime and military operations]{.underline}:  "militaries
participate in intelligence operations, conduct information operations,
conduct and support  conventional and special operations, and respond to
a limited subset of crime. Together these four  areas make up the
military cyber domain (Crowther 2017)."

A NATO strategic plan is now needed

[The other issue for NATO is to develop a **single theatre-wide
strategic plan** managed by the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe
(SACEUR) and the NATO command structure]{.underline}. In reinforcing the
alliance's eastern flank, allies have sent forces to wherever they like
and largely under national command, but this would not work in a real
war.

[NATO must revise its exercises to prepare and train for the new threat
level, ensuring its forward deployed forces are fully integrated with
local force]{.underline}s and the police and border guards to anticipate
[and respond to any Russian hybrid war tactics]{.underline}. It also
needs to step up its joint planning and interoperability with Sweden and
Finland and bring their territories into its standing defence plans.

One thing NATO has done well in this crisis is its political messaging.
[As Russia has become more threatening and reckless, it has been
essential for NATO to be consistent and predictable. Re-affirming its
core defensive purpose,]{.underline} calmly rejecting Putin's nuclear
posturing, [and refusing to put NATO forces in Ukraine may be
frustrating for some but it is vital not to play into Putin's playbook
regarding an 'aggressive NATO]{.underline}' or give him the sense he is
being pushed into a corner. However[, NATO strategic ambiguity can be
useful when considering how to respond to a Russian escalation in
Ukraine itself]{.underline}, such as using chemical weapons.

NATO is revived and refocused [Although the Russian invasion of Ukraine
is a catastrophe for Ukraine and Europe more generally, the multilateral
system has discovered a new energy and sense of purpose as NATO has been
revived and refocused on its core mission. The EU and the US have pulled
together with daily coordination of their policies and actions, and the
EU is also facing up to its geo-political role,]{.underline} as
recognizing the EU aspirations of Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia as well
as the countries of the western Balkans shows its responsibility for the
security and economic integration of the whole of Europe. The G7 has
also taken on a more day-to-day operational role and the democracies of
the Atlantic and the Pacific have united with only a few exceptions,
such as Israel which is attempting to play a mediating role. The United
Nations (UN) has also been reasonably robust with the General Assembly
finding a new lease of life. Elsewhere, the World Health Organisation
(WHO) is highlighting Russia's destruction of hospitals, the Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) is stepping up to handle the fallout from
reduced Ukrainian and Russian grain exports, the International Maritime
Organisation (IMO) is intervening in the shipping crisis, and the
International Criminal Court (ICC) is swinging into action to
investigate and -- hopefully -- prosecute Russian war crimes. [The
narrative of a 21st century contest between the democracies and the
authoritarians has been validated, even if it is too simple to explain
all the complexities and nuances of the 21st century world. There is an
opportunity for the transatlantic community to better defend itself and
to build a more effective and values-based multilateral order able to
react more systematically to rule-breaking and aggression]{.underline}
-- the question now is whether it will have the wisdom and skill to do
so.

[Yet a revised system of world order shouldn't be limited to the United
States and its traditional allies]{.underline}. It must be open to any
countries that can and will help attain its common objectives. India
should have a place at any symbolic high table, for example, as a
permanent member of the UN Security Council. But India's leaders are
still making their choices about their will and capacity to work on
common problems. [Even China should be welcome at the
table.]{.underline} After much internal debate in the early 1990s,
China's leaders chose to play a major and often constructive role in the
global commonwealth system that emerged after the end of the Cold War.
In 2005, [Zoellick famously urged Beijing to become a "responsible
stakeholder."]{.underline} As late as 2017, Kurt Campbell, who now leads
Asia policy for the Biden White House, thought this invitation was a
wise move.

[But Zoellick's words were a challenge, one that Beijing is failing to
meet.]{.underline} [China's partnership with Putin]{.underline}---whom
Xi described to the Russian press as "my best and bosom friend"---[is
the opposite of responsible.]{.underline} [Instead, it shows that China
and Russia lead a primarily Eurasian grouping of dangerous states,
including the likes of Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan. Their loose
confederation has its cross-purposes and is united mainly by hostility
toward the United States. But it is building tighter links, better
divisions of labor, and more effective coordination]{.underline} than
existed among the Axis powers before or during World War II.

For these and other reasons, pessimists believe China is irredeemably
hostile. They argue that China has written off the United States as a
country determined to resist China's rise and that Chinese leaders may
feel they have little to lose by embracing confrontation[. In this
pessimistic view, China is trying to shift from the post--Cold War era's
emphasis on global interdependence toward a Chinese grand strategy of
Eurasian dominance and growing national self-sufficiency]{.underline}.
China's leaders are now using the pandemic to keep a chokehold on
international travel and strengthen domestic surveillance.

[That does seem to be China's current plan. But it is unclear whether
this plan will work. It rests on unproven social, political, and
economic premises that are starting to deeply disturb parts of Chinese
society essential to its past and future success]{.underline}---such as
the many residents of Shanghai who have been trapped during the city's
draconian recent lockdown.

[Chinese leaders may also have noticed that, in backing the Putin
regime, they have tethered themselves to an adventurist Russian
government]{.underline} that, for 30 years, has treated its neighbors
much as Japan treated China between 1915 and 1945. For instance, Putin
insists that Russia is not invading Ukraine. There is no war, he
declared; there is only a "special military operation." Many Chinese
people will recall that, from 1937 to 1941, Japan insisted that it, too,
was not invading China. There was no war, the Japanese said; there was
merely a "China incident."

Throughout the years of Japanese aggression, the United States defended
China's territorial integrity. Even amid times of misjudgment and
weakness, Washington maintained that stance, refusing in November 1941
to make a deal with Japan at China's expense. Ten days later, Japan went
to war against the United States. [As they watch what is happening in
2022, Chinese leaders can still reflect on this past and consider what
decisions to make.]{.underline}

[If Beijing charts a new course, it would not be the first time it has
chosen to change. But if China does rejoin a system of world order, it
should be a new one. The old system has fractured and must be
remade.]{.underline} [Facing tragic realities, the citizens of the free
world must rebuild a global order that is practical enough to address
the most vital common problems, even if it cannot and does not promise
progress on all the values and concerns people face.]{.underline} [This
system will be far more effective if the world's most populous country
joins it, and China faces another time of choosing.]{.underline}
Regardless of China's participation, responsible actors must begin the
hard, substantive work of protecting the planet from war, climate,
economic, and health risks. The time for rhetoric and posturing is over.
