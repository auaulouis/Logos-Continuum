#### The discourse of the 1AC normalizes the NATO security apparatus through which Empire is made to look moral and just. The 1AC is the foot soldier extending hegemonic power through educational networks like this debate round.

NATO enlargement involves a two-fold legitimation. It rests firstly on
making NATO everyday and unremarkable, and secondly on making it morally
good. [The]{.underline} effect is one of [simultaneous banalization and
glorification of NATO]{.underline}. The alliance [is]{.underline} on the
one hand [made so common sense as to be boring---below political
debate.]{.underline} It is on the other hand made existential and
essential---above debate. The first side of this coin of
legitimation---that of banalization---is a key feature of geopolitical
discourses. These discourses rely not as much on formal arguments about
science and strategy as on the notion of common sense (O'Tuathail and
Agnew 1992:193). [Their political success stems not from their deep
meaning, but from their dailiness and banality. The militarization of
political debate and everyday life is made possible in significant
measure by domesticating military power as everyday]{.underline} (Cohn
1987; Lutz 2001). [The military--industrial complex]{.underline}, or the
military--industrial--media--entertainment network in Der Derian's
(2001) more precise terminology, [is made to appear both virtual and
virtuous, both clean and good. Its material infrastructure and material
effects are thereby erased from political debate. This is clearly the
case with NATO.]{.underline} Military terminology is all but absent from
discussions of the world's most powerful military alliance (Sidaway
2001:602). It has thus become acceptable and indeed common to speak of
war--- such as the one in Kosovo in 1999---as an "operation" concerned
with "building civil society" (see also Feldman 2003; Sidaway 2003). Yet
as Arendt (1964:288) famously pointed out over 40 years ago, banal is
not synonymous with benign. Evil can arise not from sinister intent but
from unthinking adherence to the taken-for-granted (see also Billig
1995; Gregory 2004). To speak of the banality of the
military--industrial complex, then, is not to imply triviality, but to
specify its mechanisms of operation and legitimation. It is to
underscore the "set of [silent ethical assertions]{.underline} that
[pre-organize explicit ethicopolitical discourses"]{.underline} (Shapiro
1997:16)---in this case [the assertions]{.underline} that [enable
discussions of NATO to revolve around the notions of right, peace,
culture, and values.]{.underline} As Enloe (2004:220) points out, most
of the militarization of social life, a process in which social
practices gain value and legitimacy by being associated with military
force, occurs in peacetime. To understand the dynamics of this process,
then, we need to look at the mundane rather than the spectacular, the
civilian rather than the military. The second aspect of the legitimation
of NATO---the constitution of military power as good---is a key part of
what Hardt and Negri (2000:9) call the new inscription of authority.
[Today's global power relations]{.underline}, they argue, [are based not
on force itself, but on the capacity to present force as being in the
service of right and peace.]{.underline} These relations rely on an
"ethico-political dynamic", which envelops the entire space of what it
considers civilization---a boundless, universal space (ibid.:11). [This
ethico-political dynamic lays the foundation for a renewed notion of
just war: no longer an activity of defense or resistance, but one that
is justified in itself, by the appeal to essential values and
justice.]{.underline} This just war combines two elements: first, the
legitimacy of the military apparatus insofar as it is ethically
grounded, and second, the effectiveness of military action to achieve
the desired order and peace. [The Empire's powers of intervention do not
begin directly with its weapons of lethal force but rather with its
moral instruments]{.underline} (Hardt and Negri 2000:35). They are based
on the production of the normative space of imperial right. Intervention
becomes juridically legitimate only when it is inserted into existing
international consensuses. [The first task of the Empire is "to enlarge
the realm of the consensuses that support its own power"]{.underline}
(ibid.:15).2 [The military complex becomes a key part of the production
of moral good]{.underline} (see also Flint and Falah 2004 for an
in-depth discussion of the concept of just war). Hardt and Negri
conceptualize this new notion of right as a substantively new
phenomenon. In the earlier disciplinary society, they argue, social
power was effected through administrative apparatuses that produce and
regulate customs and habits. In today's society of control, in contrast,
mechanisms of command become ever more "democratic", ever more immanent
in the social field. [The normalizing apparatuses of disciplinary
power]{.underline} do not simply intensify. In addition, and in contrast
to disciplinary society, social control today [extends well outside the
structured sites of social institutions through flexible and fluctuating
networks]{.underline} (Hardt and Negri 2000:23). Power has become
biopolitical in that [it extends throughout the depths of the
consciousnesses and bodies of the population.]{.underline} The new
notion of right, then, is not simply imposed on localities and subjects
from the outside. It is rather part and parcel of the very production of
locality and subjectivity (Hardt and Negri 2000:30). According to Hardt
and Negri (2004:13), [security]{.underline} is a form of biopower in the
sense that it [is aimed not only at controlling a population but
producing and reproducing all aspects of social life.]{.underline}3 It
is effective if it is an integral vital function of individuals. The
movement from defense to security represents a shift from a reactive and
conservative attitude to an active and constructive one (Agamben 2002).
[The normative space of imperial right is produced by a variety of
bodies in the civil society]{.underline}, including the news media and
especially non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Because these
institutions are not run by governments, they are easily presented as
acting on the basis of moral or ethical imperatives (ibid.:36). This
dynamic is especially visible in the current "war on terror", which
popular legitimation centers on the concepts of identity and universal
moral values (Dalby 2005). It is made possible by constructing military
solutions as morally just (Flint and Falah 2004). Al Quaeda's motives
are identified as cultural and moral and so are the "western" or US
responses.4 As such [bundling up of security, culture, and moral values
has moved to the centre stage of political legitimation]{.underline}
since the terrorist attacks of September 2001, we need to closely
investigate how the process works (Agamben 2002). Hardt and Negri
overemphasize the novelty of imperial subjectmaking. They downplay the
much longer processes of the construction of geographical and
geopolitical knowledge, in which the notion of universal values has
occupied a central position at least since the Age of Exploration (see
Agnew 1998; Mignolo 1995). They also under-estimate the spatiality of
power by conceptualizing imperial right as essentially a non-territorial
universalizing process that encompasses the whole globe regardless of
the current spatial configurations.5 Their argument's utility for the
present analysis stems from its focus on a key mechanism by which
[hegemonic power works]{.underline} today: [not against but through the
creative efforts of individuals.]{.underline} NATO enlargement
exemplifies this mechanism. Whereas national security discourses still
invoke the negative notion of threat, however "soft" and however
indirect, NATO enlargement discourse invokes only positive
categories---values, democracy, openness. [NATO, like Empire, is a
"machine for universal integration. It does not fortify its boundaries
to push others away, but rather pulls them within its pacific
order"]{.underline} (Hardt and Negri 2000:198). [NATO is central to the
institutional structure through which military intervention is organized
and legitimized today, and it is continually bolstering its technical
capabilities to operate globally. Its]{.underline} enlargement
[discourse is moralistic, affective, and adamantly non-territorial, as
it emphasizes not territories but universal values.]{.underline} NATO
enlargement can therefore illuminate in rich empirical detail how [the
production of imperial right and the militarization of social life work
on a daily basis.]{.underline}

#### The alternative critiques NATO operations within their constitutive historical context. IR's isolation of analysis from the past naturalizes the present and obscures the unconscious operations of power. The alt is the only way to come to grips with NATO's referents of security.

According to John Hobson, contemporary [IR is
"historophobic"]{.underline}, in that [it "\[v\]iews historical analysis
as superfluous]{.underline} or exogenous to the subject matter of the
discipline" (2002: 5). To Hobson, [IR scholars have mostly adopted an
instrumentalist]{.underline} and exogenous [view of history, in order to
support and confirm theories of the present. Instead]{.underline} of
that, Hobson suggests, [we should employ a]{.underline} temporally
relativist or [constitutive reading of history, as a means to rethink
theories and problematise the analysis of the present, thus
reconfiguring the IR research agenda]{.underline} (ibid). However, it
has not always been like that. At the time of its emergence as an
academic discipline, in 1919, IR comprised a body of knowledge, which
included history among other various disciplines, such as economics,
sociology, law and moral philosophy (Hobden, 2002). But with the
behaviourist revolution in the 1950's and 1960's, IR started privileging
structure and space over time and context in analyses of world politics
(Walker, 1989 cit. in Vaughan-Williams, 2005). This resulted in
mainstream IR being reconstructed along asociological and ahistorical
lines (Hobden, 2002). To Richard Ashley (1989: 263), [the consequence of
not dealing with]{.underline} what he considers to be [the "problem of
history"]{.underline} -- i.e., the impossibility of getting historical
interpretation completely right -- [is that IR prefers to impose a
representation that closes ambiguity and controls the proliferation of
meaning]{.underline}, instead of projecting the uncertainty of
historical meaning onto its object of study. Hence, the idea that time
is regular, as meanings remain stationary independently of the time they
represent. More importantly, as a result of this aversion, insouciance
or superficiality towards history, two "illusions" arise. On the one
hand, [the "reification illusion" consists in isolating the present from
the past, making it appear as static]{.underline}, self-constituting,
[and autonomous]{.underline}; in other words, the present is represented
as a reified entity, [thereby obscuring its socio-temporal
context]{.underline} (Hobson, 2002: 6). On the other hand, there is also
a "naturalism illusion", meaning that [the present is naturalised on the
basis that it emerged spontaneously in accordance with natural human
imperatives]{.underline}, thereby [obscuring the historical processes of
social power]{.underline}, identity/social exclusion [and norms that
constitute the present]{.underline} (Hobson, 2002: 6). Clearly, both
these illusions may be verified in the treatment of the object of this
study. As suggested earlier, civilisation appears as a reified product
in NATO literature, and normative evolutions such as the
Individualisation of Security are naturalised without further
questioning how and why they surged. Furthermore, according to historian
Fernand Braudel (1958), social duration is an aspect of history that is
often ignored and misconceived by the social sciences in general.
Therefore, Braudel (1958: 726) defends the importance and usefulness of
history in terms of its underlying dialectic of time. To him, the
ability to perceive the antagonism between the instantaneous moment and
the slowness of long time passing by -- the "plurality of time" -- is
essential to understanding social reality.7 The problem of time is
crucial for this research. It assumes that IR's approach of temporality
and of the meanings associated to it has been rather rigid, which has
too often limited our reflection of international phenomena to short
duration terms. In turn, [this shortness of sight has hidden the
importance of unconscious meanings and their perpetuation in history,
which is why phenomena ultimately have appeared in naturalised and
unquestioned ways.]{.underline} Likewise, analyses on NATO have
primarily focused on short and medium term changes, without referring to
any longer-term pattern, such as the implicaitons of civilisational
defence. Therefore, it is a matter of reflecting on how a recent
duration trend such as the Individualisation of Security fits into a
longer-term objective -- the civilisational heritage of the people in
the NATO area. This work precisely attempts to address this gap in the
literature on NATO in two interrelated ways. One consists in embracing
time through a "long duration" framework -- longue durée (Braudel,
1958). Once again, to Braudel (1979 apud Cox, 2002b), different segments
of social and human life have different tempos or timings. Economic
change operates at a different pace from art, architecture, or law, for
example. Even though these changes may be related to each other, they
are not synchronous. Consequently, [the history of how mentalities
evolve moves at a different pace from the history of material
life]{.underline}, even if they both interact (ibid.). Under Braudel,
these different histories and tempos contain three levels of time: (1)
the level of immediacy, that is, the simple duration of events --
l'histoire événementielle; it has no explanation, for it needs to be
framed within the spatial and temporal context in which it occurs. (2)
Conjunctures -- conjonctures -- represent an intermediary temporality,
such as a protracted economic cycle, a persisting configuration of
social forces, such as Fordism, social democracy, a scientific paradigm.
(3) Long duration -- longue durée -- is a historical structure created
by collective human activity throughout a large period of time; examples
are language, moral code, and state system (ibid.). Consequently, it may
be presumed that, within NATO, short-term changes such as the move
towards out-of-area interventions (as in Afghanistan and Libya) have
coexisted with medium term changes (such as the adoption of new
strategic concepts), and with long-term patterns such as the
civilisational defence of the North Atlantic.8 Temporality thus helps to
establish a relation between the two referent objects of security that
are at the core of this investigation -- civilisation and individuals.
On the one hand, the Individualisation of Security represents a medium
term normative change, as a conjunctural paradigm of international
security defined by [NATO's different military
interventions]{.underline}. On the other hand, the Individualisation of
Security [needs to be related to the Alliance's long duration objectives
such as the civilisation of its people.]{.underline} Ultimately, [by
considering these]{.underline} three [levels of temporality when
analysing NATO, it will be possible to highlight how its historical
evolution]{.underline} as an organisation [occurred along with the
evolution of mentalities, and perceptions of the world.]{.underline}
Taken together, [these perspectives will help reconstituting a much more
complete and comprehensive analysis of NATO's referents of
security.]{.underline}

**NATO is aimed at the subversion and control of the forces of
decolonization -- it is a mechanism of the informal empire of racial
globalization**

**Fraser 13 **(Cary, Former President of the University of Belize in
Central America & current Associate Professor of Political Science,
Decolonization and the Cold War, Oxford Handbook of the Cold War,
1/2013, https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/345084571.pdf, accessed

[Decolonization was]{.underline} thus both [a response to the
globalization of European influence and]{.underline} a process of
globalization that [paved the way for the dismantling of the North
Atlantic centered international system. It was driven simultaneously by
imperatives of imperial deconstruction and the
constitution/reconstruction of sovereignty in the former
colonies.]{.underline} However, scholars also need to give greater
thought to the ways in which decolonization was both reflective of the
rise of nationalist sentiment and a process that was larger than the
relationship between the imperial powers and their respective colonies.
Future scholarship will need to be attentive to the international and
transnational dimensions of decolonization as a global process. There is
much to be said about the ways in which the diplomatic initiatives of
new nations such as India, Indonesia, and Egypt that emerged after 1945
helped to mobilize resources and develop strategies to accelerate and
expand the opportunities for the decolonization process by way of the
United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Commonwealth Group of
Nations linking the former British colonies, and other multilateral
fora. Similarly, the role of the Soviet Union, the People\'s Republic of
China, and Cuba in providing military supplies, military advisors, and,
on occasion, combat units to nationalist movements challenging the
colonial powers helped to accelerate the decolonization process after
1945. Decolonization was part of the shifting terrain of international
relations and a factor in the calculus of the global balance of power.
In addition[, the decolonization process helped to create avenues of
political mobilization within the imperial centers which opened
opportunities for coalitions supportive of decolonization to engage and
influence policy at home and in the wider international
system.]{.underline} In Britain, the Labour Party became a major factor
in pushing the process of decolonization, while the Communist and
Socialist parties played similar roles in France. The rise of the
American civil rights movement, which challenged the domestic racial
regime, had a catalytic effect upon the national liberation struggles in
various African countries. In turn, the rise of independent states in
Africa forced American policymakers to recognize the paradox of its
claim to "leadership of the Free World." As a consequence, the American
racial regime became a casualty of the cold war and decolonization after
1945. This interactive effect between the struggle for national
liberation in colonies across the international system and the impetus
for social and political change in other societies is, perhaps, best
represented in the ways in which Gandhi\'s advocacy of nonviolence to
challenge both South African race policies and British colonial rule in
India helped to frame the civil rights struggle in the United States.
The transnational activism that shaped the decolonization process had a
"domino effect" that required new avenues of collaboration among the
colonial powers for policies aimed at preventing, slowing, and/or
defining the process of decolonization during the cold war. [The North
Atlantic Treaty Organization was not simply about a mutual security pact
that provided an American commitment to the defense of Western
Europe---it was also a mechanism used to develop coordinated strategies
for dealing with the decolonization process in the non-European
world.]{.underline} In the 1950s, [America helped France contain the
communist insurgency in Vietnam as a way to maintain a French commitment
to the containment of the Soviet Union in Europe.]{.underline}
Similarly, [America premised its support for the Portuguese colonies in
Southern Africa on the need to maintain access to military bases in the
Azores for American military oper- ations within the NATO
alliance]{.underline}. [NATO represented an alliance of the European
colonial powers with the United States that influenced the process of
decolonization after 1945.]{.underline} As a consequence
[NATO]{.underline}, as one of the major alliance systems in the cold
war, [became a vehicle for the expansion of America\'s "informal empire"
on the global stage and symbolized the Western Alliance\'s commitment to
maintaining the politics of racial supremacy that had underpinned the
pre-1945 global order.]{.underline}

Ikenberry's benign interpretation of the US-led order is read back into
the activities between 1939 and 1945 of elite planners of the postwar
order. Developing the 'Grand Area' concept, [planners in]{.underline}
the [State Department and the Council on Foreign Relations]{.underline}
(CFR) [identified the world zones the United States 'required' in order
to avoid having to radically reform its economy]{.underline}---[zones
that]{.underline} together [encompassed]{.underline} practically [the
whole world]{.underline}.56 The key point elided is that [it was to
cohere]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [imperial 'Grand Area' that so
much of the institutional architecture of western power was
built]{.underline}---[the IMF and World Bank, the UN,]{.underline} the
Marshall Plan, GATT [and NATO.]{.underline}57 [The interrelations
between]{.underline} the Grand Area's [regions were never envisaged as
being]{.underline} in any sense [equal]{.underline}---[raw materials
would flow towards western reconstruction and social peace,]{.underline}
and finished industrial goods in the other direction. [The postwar
settlement at home that coalesced]{.underline}, as Hogan argues,58
[around high-technology capital-intensive industries]{.underline},
[international finance and organized skilled labour, was located within
an international settlement that secured broad corporate interests under
the auspices of an interventionist state]{.underline}. And, in that
respect, [America's military capacity to police flows of goods across
the world was at the very least a part of the reason why the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [acquired]{.underline}
'[forward bases in Asia and Europe']{.underline}.59 As policy-makers
such as Henry Stimson and John J. McCloy noted, [American and western
well-being relied on '"open markets, access to raw materials, and the
rehabilitation of]{.underline} much---if not [all---of Eurasia along
liberal capitalist lines]{.underline}"'.60 [CFR and State Department
wartime planning was]{.underline} therefore [driven above all by a
vision of global]{.underline}--[imperial leadership exercised by US
elites,]{.underline} [strongly supported by Britain's]{.underline}
[ruling elites]{.underline}, [via an international order of
organizations and relationships]{.underline}.61 [The aim
was,]{.underline} acting in concert with Britain's elites, [to resurrect
European Great Powers by]{.underline} [means including the restoration
of shattered colonial trading and economic and financial
linkages]{.underline}. [The Marshall Plan viewed European reconstruction
in just that global context.]{.underline}62 [The UN was envisaged as a
key international agency for American imperial internationalism, at
least in its earliest days6]{.underline}3---[and, as its role in the
making of South Korea shows, it remains the official basis of America's
role in that country today]{.underline}. And, as I will show below, the
building of a hegemonic multilateral order indicates the significance of
a Gramsci--Kautsky synthesis.

[It is nearly a truism that US wars of regime change have rarely served
America's security needs.]{.underline} [Even when the wars succeed in
overthrowing a government]{.underline}, as in the case of the Taliban in
Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and Moammar Khadafy in Libya, the
result is rarely a stable government, and is more often a civil war. [A
"successful" regime change often lights a long fuse leading to a future
explosion,]{.underline} such as the 1953 overthrow of Iran's
democratically elected government and installation of the autocratic
Shah of Iran, which was followed by the Iranian Revolution of 1979. In
many other cases, such as the US attempts (with Saudi Arabia and Turkey)
to overthrow Syria's Bashar al-Assad, the result is a bloodbath and
military standoff rather than an overthrow of the government.. .  [WHAT
IS THE DEEP motivation for these profligate wars]{.underline} and for
the far-flung military bases that support them? [From 1950 to 1990, the
superficial answer would have been the Cold War. Yet America's imperial
behavior overseas predates the Cold War by half a century]{.underline}
(back to the Spanish American War, in 1898) [and has outlasted it by
another quarter century. America's overseas imperial adventures began
after the Civil War and the final conquests of the Native American
nations. At that point, US political and business leaders sought to join
the European empires]{.underline} --- especially Britain, France,
Russia, and the newly emergent Germany --- [in overseas
conquests]{.underline}. In short order, [America grabbed the
Philippines, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Panama, and Hawaii, and joined the
European imperial powers in knocking on the doors of China. As of the
1890s, the United States was by far the world's largest economy, but
until World War II, it took a back seat to the British Empire in global
naval power, imperial reach, and geopolitical dominance. The British
were the unrivaled masters of regime change]{.underline} --- for
example, in carving up the corpse of the Ottoman Empire after World War
I. Yet the exhaustion from two world wars and the Great Depression ended
the British and French empires [after World War II and thrust the United
States and Russia into the forefront as the two main global
empires.]{.underline} The Cold War had begun. The economic underpinning
of America's global reach was unprecedented. As of 1950, US output
constituted a remarkable 27 percent of global output, with the Soviet
Union roughly a third of that, around 10 percent. [The Cold War fed two
fundamental ideas that would shape American foreign policy till now. The
first was that the United States was in a struggle for survival against
the Soviet empire. The second was that every country,]{.underline} no
matter how remote, [was a battlefield in that global war.]{.underline}
While [the United States]{.underline} and the Soviet Union would avoid a
direct confrontation, they [flexed their muscles in hot wars around the
world that served as proxies for the superpower
competition]{.underline}. Over the course of nearly a half century,
[Cuba, Congo, Ghana, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Iran, Namibia, Mozambique, Chile, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and
even tiny Granada, among many others, were interpreted by US strategists
as battlegrounds with the Soviet empire.]{.underline} Often, far more
prosaic interests were involved. Private companies like United Fruit
International and ITT convinced friends in high places (most famously
the Dulles brothers, Secretary of State John Foster and CIA director
Allen) that land reforms or threatened expropriations of corporate
assets were dire threats to US interests, and therefore in need of USled
regime change. Oil interests in the Middle East were another repeated
cause of war, as had been the case for the British Empire from the
1920s. These wars destabilized and impoverished the countries involved
rather than settling the politics in America's favor. The wars of regime
change were, with few exceptions, a litany of foreign policy failure.
They were also extraordinarily costly for the United States itself. The
Vietnam War was of course the greatest of the debacles, so expensive, so
bloody, and so controversial that it crowded out Lyndon Johnson's other,
far more important and promising war, the War on Poverty, in the United
States. The end of the Cold War, in 1991, should have been the occasion
for a fundamental reorientation of US guns-versus-butter policies. The
occasion offered the United States and the world a "peace dividend," the
opportunity to reorient the world and US economy from war footing to
sustainable development. Indeed, the Rio Earth Summit, in 1992,
established sustainable development as the centerpiece of global
cooperation, or so it seemed. The far smarter approach will be to
maintain America's defensive capabilities but end its imperial
pretensions. Alas, the blinders and arrogance of American imperial
thinking prevented the United States from settling down to a new era of
peace. As the Cold War was ending, the United States was beginning a new
era of wars, this time in the Middle East. The United States would sweep
away the Soviet-backed regimes in the Middle East and establish
unrivalled US political dominance. Or at least that was the plan.. . .
[THE QUARTER CENTURY since 1991 has therefore been marked by a perpetual
US war in the Middle East]{.underline}, one that has destabilized the
region, massively diverted resources away from civilian needs toward the
military, and helped to create mass budget deficits and the buildup of
public debt. [The imperial thinking has led to wars of regime change in
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, and Syria, across four
presidencies:]{.underline} George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W.
Bush, and Barack Obama. [**The same thinking has induced the United
States to expand NATO to Russia's borders,** despite the fact that
NATO's supposed purpose was to defend against an adversary --- the
Soviet Union --- that no longer exists.]{.underline} Former Soviet
president Mikhail [Gorbachev has emphasized that eastward NATO expansion
"was certainly a violation of the spirit of those declarations and
assurances that we were given in 1990,"]{.underline} regarding the
future of East-West security. There is a major economic difference,
however, between now and 1991, much less 1950. At the start of the Cold
War, in 1950, the United States produced around 27 percent of world
output. As of 1991, when the Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz dreams of US
dominance were taking shape, the United States accounted for around 22
percent of world production. By now, according to IMF estimates, the US
share is 16 percent, while China has surpassed the United States, at
around 18 percent. By 2021, according to projections by the
International Monetary Fund, the United States will produce roughly 15
percent of global output compared with China's 20 percent. The United
States is incurring massive public debt and cutting back on urgent
public investments at home in order to sustain a dysfunctional,
militarized, and costly foreign policy. Thus comes a fundamental choice.
The United States can vainly continue the neoconservative project of
unipolar dominance, even as the recent failures in the Middle East and
America's declining economic preeminence guarantee the ultimate failure
of this imperial vision. If, as some neoconservatives support, the
United States now engages in an arms race with China, we are bound to
come up short in a decade or two, if not sooner. The costly wars in the
Middle East --- even if continued much less enlarged in a Hillary
Clinton presidency --- could easily end any realistic hopes for a new
era of scaled-up federal investments in education, workforce training,
infrastructure, science and technology, and the environment. The far
smarter approach will be to maintain America's defensive capabilities
but end its imperial pretensions. This, in practice, means cutting back
on the far-flung network of military bases, ending wars of regime
change, avoiding a new arms race (especially in next-generation nuclear
weapons), and engaging China, India, Russia, and other regional powers
in stepped-up diplomacy through the United Nations, especially through
shared actions on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, including
climate change, disease control, and global education. Many American
conservatives will sneer at the very thought that the United States'
room for maneuver should be limited in the slightest by the UN. But
think how much better off the United States would be today had it heeded
the UN Security Council's wise opposition to the wars of regime change
in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Many conservatives will point to Vladimir
Putin's actions in Crimea as proof that diplomacy with Russia is
useless, without recognizing that it was NATO's expansion to the Baltics
and its 2008 invitation to Ukraine to join NATO, that was a primary
trigger of Putin's response. In the end, the Soviet Union bankrupted
itself through costly foreign adventures such as the 1979 invasion of
Afghanistan and its vast over-investment in the military. Today the
United States has similarly over-invested in the military, and could
follow a similar path to decline if it continues the wars in the Middle
East and invites an arms race with China. [It's time to abandon the
reveries, burdens, and self-deceptions of empire and to invest in
sustainable development at home and in partnership with the rest of the
world. ]{.underline}

### Link---NATO Security

#### NATO's conception of "security" is unconsciously structured by a racialized drive to secure the future for the civilizational identify of North Atlantic people.

**da Mota**, PhD in IR at University of Coimbra, **2016** (Sarah
Carreira, \"NATO: upholding Civilisation, protecting Individuals. The
unconscious dimension of international security,\" University of
Coimbra, September 2016, google scholar, accessed 7/6/2022, gdi-tmur)

Heidrun Friese (2006: 298) has referred to three complex dimensions
composing the notion of "cultural identiy": (1) the unchangeable
structure of things, that which is seen to constitute the nature, or the
essence, of things across time and historical transformations; (2) the
relations human beings have with themselves and others, involving their
intentions, actions, experiences, dreams and memories, although
"'selfhood' might have been cast throughout history; (3) [the historical
references to shifting relations between human beings, to concepts of
belonging, and a common and shared (symbolic) world]{.underline}, values
and language, an inclusive 'We' differing from an exclusive 'Them'. Put
in other words, the civilisational identity as defined by O'Hagan (2002)
and the civilisational sense of history as conceived by Gress (1998) are
cultural, as they display the same basic feature of a transcendent sense
of naturality across time, defining both Selfhood and Otherness around a
core of metaphysical elements. Globally, these considerations on the
West do not bring much tangibility to the matter. More importantly, they
[reinforce the need to question the presence of an unconscious dimension
in the perception of the West as a civilisation.]{.underline} To what
extent does [this unconscious dimension of knowledge, with its latent
and invisible meanings, influence the]{.underline} contemporary [sense
of international security as conveyed by NATO]{.underline}? First, NATO
is a political and military alliance, whose chief goals consist of the
collective defence of its members. In the preamble NATO's founding
treaty, it is thus established that the Parties \[a\]re determined to
safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their
peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and
the rule of law (NATO, 1949). In this statement, [the referent object of
the Alliance's action -- what is to be secured -- is clearly collective,
and united by a shared representation of history and
civilisation.]{.underline} Ab origine and formally, [NATO's raison
d'être does not]{.underline} seem to [depend on a conceptual category
such as the individual. "Individual liberty" is]{.underline} indeed
[mentioned, but it still appears as a valuing principle of a collective
referent. "Civilisation" surges as the primordial referent of the
defensive and protective mission that the new alliance was committing
to]{.underline} (NATO, 1949). As in any other international
organisation, NATO's mission and identity from then on would depend on
the strength of the concepts, ideas and norms used to formulate its
existence. Throughout sixty years of existence, NATO has crossed two
distinct ideological eras, each one with a different influence on the
geopolitical division of the world. It also had to respond and adapt to
deep questioning periods from the international community (Barany and
Rauchhause, 2011; Kay, 1998; Zorgbibe, 2002). Again, NATO is a political
and military organisation that primarily exists to promote the defence
and security of the "civilisation of its people". It is noteworthy that
[NATO was not proposing to safeguard the existence of its people, but
rather their very attributes]{.underline}, which it identifies as
"liberty", a "common heritage", and "civilisation". If, to NATO, these
very attributes precede the importance of the people's very existence,
then the existence of the people ultimately depends on the safeguard of
those attributes. Therefore, if the people of the North Atlantic Treaty
see themselves deprived of their liberty, and if their common heritage
and civilisation are somehow destroyed, will they cease to exist? The
physical integrity of a human collective may tragically subsist, even
though it does not enjoy liberty. Transcontinental slavery is an example
that marks the history of many Western countries between the sixteenth
and nineteenth centuries. Besides, can a human collective endure if its
common heritage, or civilisation, disappears? As the extinction of
ancient civilisations shows, individual elements may survive physically,
but not the idea, the identity of the collective they belong to, with
all its specific anthropological characteristics -- social organisation,
natural and food resources management, relational dynamics, etc.
Extinguished ancient civilisations subsist today mainly in historical
memory and material remains. Therefore, one may assume that [NATO's
primordial referent of security, that is, what was decisive for the
organisation to emerge, and what it aims at defending and protecting,
consists of the attributes it identifies as being vital. NATO's referent
of security consists of a metaphysical entity]{.underline} that
overcomes all institutional models, boundaries, specific historical
temporalities, because it refers to such a broad idea as civilisation.
[It refers in fact to a "civilisational identity"]{.underline} (O'Hagan,
2002). Although [specific values]{.underline} such as democracy,
individual liberty and the rule of law are evoked, they do [emerge in a
position that is subordinated to that of civilisation as its foundation,
as guiding norms for the execution of civilisational
defence.]{.underline} Therefore, and in the light of the premise that
security has become a metaphysical field (Burgess, 2011), characterising
most of interinstitutional and interpersonal relations of the twentieth
century, NATO constitutes an object of study of excellence. [It is thus
a product of the West, declaredly oriented at protecting the
civilisation of the North-Atlantic people]{.underline} (NATO, 1949).

#### NATO security policies are premised on the universalization and preservation a static and ahistorical notion of Western culture, increasing militarism and re-securitization of international politics

**da Mota**, PhD in IR at University of Coimbra, **2016** (Sarah
Carreira, \"NATO: upholding Civilisation, protecting Individuals. The
unconscious dimension of international security,\" University of
Coimbra, September 2016, google scholar, accessed 7/6/2022, gdi-tmur)

Michael C. Williams (2007) has demonstrated how, [after the Cold War,
there was a return of culture, in an appeal to the triumph of Western
culture, of the universality of its liberal values, ideals and
institutions.]{.underline} To Williams[, cultural practices have been
central in the transformations of the USA's and EU's security policies,
as well as in NATO's evolution. The cultural dimension of security
revealed]{.underline} as a new strategy, [a new basis for a new set of
power relations]{.underline}: [By defining security in terms of forms of
culture, itself a generative product of the habitus prevailing in
Western security institutions, the field of security was transformed
into one where cultural and symbolic forms of capital became vital --
and one in which these forms of capital were dominantly possessed by
Western states, societies, and security organizations]{.underline}
(Williams, 2007: 40). To Stefano Guzzini, the post-Cold War debate about
the "West" is rather connected to the revival of geopolitical thought.
As Guzzini argues, that revival should not be understood as a "normal"
consequence of the end of the Cold War, but rather as "\[a\]n answer to,
or an easy fix for, the sense of dis-orientation and foreign policy
identity crises which followed 1989" (2015: 5). In Guzzini's argument,
not only are "re-identification" and politics of representation at the
centre of the revitalisation of the "West", as [they have negatively
contributed to increased militarism and to the re-securitisation of
international politics, and ultimately, to a "\[v\]ision of an
exclusionary Fortress West"]{.underline} (ibid.). So, Lippmann's (1941)
apprehensions during WWII that Western civilisation was failing in
making its values endure, and the resurgence of the West in the 1990's,
tell us that periods of war and political instability, or uncertainty,
may have a determining effect on the reappearance of the fear that
civilisation, or civilisational world order, might be under threat.
However, the possibility of viewing time differently as a sequence of
historical moments and evolutive trends was replaced by the predominance
of cultural concerns or, at the other extreme, by cultural coverture and
fortification. This is why [references to Western civilisation in
literature on NATO generally focus on the post-Cold War period only,
which results in a static, stable and self-reproducing view of
civilisation, conceptualised as being independent of any structural
context, thus reinforcing culturalist representations.]{.underline} This
can be seen, for example, in Peter Van Ham's assessment of "whether the
cultural glue ostensibly keeping 'the West' together remains strong
enough to endure post-Cold War transatlantic tensions" (2001: 394),
which takes Huntington's concept of civilisation as a conceptual basis.
Likewise, the possible outcomes of civilisation on NATO's security
policies -- just as the Individualisation of Security, for instance --
have not been equated either.

### Link---NATO Humanitarianism

#### Constructions of NATO within a humanitarian frame normalizes militarism through the individualization of security. It decentralizes violence throughout the globe.

**da Mota**, PhD in IR at University of Coimbra, **2016** (Sarah
Carreira, \"NATO: upholding Civilisation, protecting Individuals. The
unconscious dimension of international security,\" University of
Coimbra, September 2016, google scholar, accessed 7/6/2022, gdi-tmur)

[Civilisation is both a conscious and unconscious
phenomenon]{.underline}, as it lies in complex ways between the
self-conscious representation of a particular entity such as the West,
and the unconscious knowledge, or interiorisation, of timeless values
and perceptions. Hence, [when NATO]{.underline} (1949) [evoked the
defence and permanence of a civilisation in its founding
treaty]{.underline}, it was not only referring to the safeguard of a
shared historical past, of a series of political achievements, of a
mentality, a specific vision of the world, a cultural and identity
bound, as it was also referring to a normative acquis. In turn, this
acquis is the contemporary result of a gradual evolution of persons and
ideas, from the past to the moment of NATO's emergence as an
organisation. By doing this primordial and defining reference to
civilisation, [NATO correlated another fundamental idea]{.underline},
that is, [security]{.underline} (Coker, 2002). NATO's relation to
civilisation is thus simultaneously one of representation, in that it
embodies the civilisation of one region of the world, and also a
relation of operationalisation, as a tool of and for civilisational
defence. In this study, NATO's primordial relation to civilisation is
confronted to the most decisive and influential normative trend in
post-Cold War international security, which I term the
"[Individualisation of Security]{.underline}". The expression
"Individualisation of Security" per se should not be interpreted as a
naïve or simplistic apology of the individual; it [is]{.underline}
rather used to describe [the political process of transformative
discourses and practices using individualistic valuations of human
societies in relation to the state]{.underline}. As it will be seen, the
[Individualisation of Security consists of the new visibility given by
political actors to a referent object of security other than the
state]{.underline}, i.e., [the individual]{.underline}. Progressively,
the Individualisation of Security has re-oriented security policies and
their related discourses and rationales from the state to the
individual. Furthermore, [it]{.underline} also [expresses a tangible
security practice, from the moment it determines how security policies
are directed, involving not only its referent object, as its subject of
security as well]{.underline} (Booth, 2005; Walker, 1997). 4
Conceptually, this trend emerging after the Cold War was associated to
the notions of "human security", "humanitarianism", and "human
development", because of the actions undertaken by international
organisations such as the United Nations (UN) and the European Union
(EU). These [entities gradually internalised in their discourses and
policies the idea that protecting individual lives should come first, or
before the state]{.underline} (Kaldor et al., 2004; UNDP, 1994). [Those
notions were indeed very well received and adopted in the codes of
conduct of many]{.underline} international [organisations]{.underline},
NGO's, [and]{.underline} foreign policies of some [states]{.underline}
such as Canada, Norway and Japan -- in particular human security (Ramel,
2003; Suhrke, 1999). Along this line, in 2001, the principle of
Responsibility to Protect (R2P) was also formulated in the reports of
the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty
(ICISS, 2001), and endorsed as a doctrine at the UN World Summit in 2005
by UN member states. R2P has offered a more institutional expression to
some unanimous yet non-binding premises articulated around the
responsibility to protect the populations from top four inhumane crimes:
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity.
This overall movement thus followed the norm "life cycle" (Finnemore and
Sikkink, 1998), as we may verify the emergence of the norm, its
acceptance and internalisation. 5 [Security was]{.underline} therefore
[individualised through a normative change in the way of thinking and
practising security, by focusing on the argument in favour of protecting
the individual in contexts of violence, repression, or persecution by a
state]{.underline}. Within NATO, the Individualisation of Security was
put into practice since its military participation in Bosnia-Herzegovina
(BH) between 1992 and 1995, and opened a precedent for ulterior
humanitarian interventions. This normative transformation was
significant to the Alliance, and served the purpose of its institutional
reinvention after the Cold War. With its intervention in Kosovo in 1999,
NATO definitely reinforced the importance of individual security in its
discourses, as well as human security and human rights. This represents
a move from the idea of collective defence that prevailed in the
strategic conception of NATO operations during the Cold War to global
security (ICISS, 2001; Whitman, 2000). More recently, NATO's
intervention in Libya was justified by a reiterated concern over
deterring the attacks of Muammar Gadhafi's regime on civilians (NATO,
2011), legally drawing on the United Nations Security Council's (UNSC)
Resolutions 1970, 1973 and 2009. In this context, the numerous
references to "the protection of civilians" showed and reaffirmed the
Alliance's penchant towards humanitarian interventions, guided by
ethical and moral purposes, and a specific mandate to that end (NATO,
2011). More broadly, the [Individualisation of Security]{.underline}
suggests the rising of a cosmopolitan consciousness, in which the
realisation of human interdependence, or interconnectedness, [leads
states to act in territories other than their own, in a sort of
decentralising process of the original monopolistic state]{.underline}.
In theory, a new norm does not necessarily imply that it is
automatically opted, for it must compete with pre-existing norms, in a
political process in which forms of power and coalitions intertwine
(Jepperson et al., 1996). However, the life cycle of the
Individualisation of Security indicates that there has been a
transformation of behaviour in both individuals and international
society, whereby [humanitarian reasoning seems to have taken
predominance in the decade following the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}. Indeed, in the period between the end of the Cold War
and the international military presence in Afghanistan after 9/11, the
[Individualisation of Security has produced a general discourse of
discipline and normalisation]{.underline}, [according to which a
political-military conduct respective of individuals was progressively
assumed to be natural for all states]{.underline}.

### Link---NATO Enlargement

#### NATO enlargement relies itself on promotion of pervasive liberal democratic norms and values to enable enlightenment

**Kuus 2007** (Merje, political geographer studying epistemology of
institutions, \"\'Love, Peace and Nato\': Imperial Subject-Making in
Central Europe,\" Antipode, Vol. 39, Issue 2, pg. 269-290, March 2007,
google scholar, accessed 7/6/2022, gdi-tmur)

[NATO has been legitimized on the basis of "values" since its
inception]{.underline}. Created as a defense alliance against Soviet
communism, NATO was traditionally linked to the notions of democracy and
freedom. In the post-Cold War era, as arguments about Soviet threat were
no longer sufficient, [values became]{.underline} the [discursive pillar
of NATO's existence and enlargement]{.underline}.6 The remarks of US
Secretary of State Powell (2004), spoken when welcoming new members to
the Alliance, are instructive of the shift:

> My friends, for most of its existence, NATO has been concerned mainly
> with the defense of common territory. NATO is now transformed, as only
> a league of democracies can be, into an alliance concerned mainly with
> the defense of common values and common ideas.
>
> NATO was determined, above all, to prevent aggression. Now it is
> determined, above all, to promote freedom, to extend the reach of
> liberty, and to deepen the peace.

NATO's Secretary General de Hoop Scheffer echoed this point at NATO's
Istanbul summit that same year: 

> We're defending values \... And I think they should be defended every
> single day and every single hour. We see examples of that everywhere
> around that NATO is---it's about values, has always been about values,
> and it's still about values (The White House 2004).

It is a clich´e now that NATO's post-Cold War enlargements were
motivated by the desire in both East and West to make Europe "whole and
free", to reunite and secure the continent as a community of common
identity or values. In both the member and the applicant states, [it
became common sense and indeed obligatory to say that NATO]{.underline}
has contributed to "expanding liberal--democratic norms and values" in
Central Europe. NATO was cast as a tool for an array of civilian issues
such as inter-state relations ("democracies do not fight"), democracy
("NATO stabilizes domestic politics") economic growth ("NATO membership
improves a country's investment rating") or minority rights (NATO
membership "assures" the majority of its secure position in the state
and simultaneously "encourages" the minority to integrate) (see Moore
2003; Schimmelfennig 2000). Garton Ash (2002) indeed remarks that EU and
NATO [enlargements were]{.underline} "[the driving forces]{.underline}"
[in]{.underline} the [democratization]{.underline} and pacification of
"the other half of Europe". A veritable cottage industry now documents
NATO's "good deeds" in Europe. Central European countries certainly
carefully consider NATO positions on issues like minority rights and
civil--military relations, and NATO certainly has contributed to
stabilizing conflict zones such as parts of the former Yugoslavia
(Dahlman and O'Tuathail 2005). [The point here is]{.underline} not to
deny this influence, but [to expose and problematize a particular
inscription of morality and causality: the presumption that it was
obviously because of NATO's good moral influence that we do not hear of
widespread regional instability or human rights abuses in]{.underline}
Central [Europe. The value-based framing of NATO was important in
enabling enlargement]{.underline}. [With NATO as wholesome and good
as]{.underline} "[motherhood and apple pie]{.underline}" (Grudzinski and
van Ham 1999), [it became difficult for any group or state to oppose
enlargement]{.underline}---[lest it be cast as an outsider
to]{.underline} "[European values]{.underline}" (Williams and Neumann
2000).7

This [narrative of NATO enlightened and good is especially pervasive
in]{.underline} Central [Europe]{.underline}, [where it enframes
virtually all utterances of security, defense, and foreign policy more
broadly]{.underline} (Oas 2005). Across the region and throughout the
integration process, NATO [membership was cast in dramatic and
existential terms as integral parts of the region's return to its
European home]{.underline}. The pro-[NATO]{.underline} lobby did not
imply a threat to NATO's member or candidate states. It [conceived of
membership]{.underline} not as an answer to strategic issues but [as a
reward for and a marker of]{.underline} "[sameness]{.underline}"
[with]{.underline} the [west on the basis of]{.underline}
"[values]{.underline}" (Popescu 2005:461). As Polish Foreign Minister
Geremek put it in 1997: "We have spared no effort to return to the roots
of our culture and statehood \... to join the Euro-Atlantic family of
democratic nations. This is the essence of our aspirations to join
NATO". The alliance, he continued, "has managed to pit its immense
military might in services of fundamental values and principles that we
share. NATO can make Europe safe for democracy. No other organization
can make Europe safe for democracy" (quoted in Moore 2003:64). Estonia's
Foreign Minister Ilves (1996) likewise stressed that [NATO membership
would codify]{.underline} "[common values]{.underline}---[peace,
freedom, democracy and welfare]{.underline}---which Estonia values above
all". He indeed explicitly distanced NATO aspirations from the notion of
threat, declaring a year later that "Estonia does not want to join the
NATO of the Cold War. In both location and spirit Estonia is a part of
the new Europe and we feel entitled to be constructively involved in the
formation of the new European defence arrangement" (Ilves 1997). Czech
President Havel (2002a) argued that NATO has a cultural "valuebased" and
"civilizational" identity alongside its geographic and strategic
identity because the alliance was designed to defend certain values,
such as political order, human rights, the rule of law, market economy,
freedom of expression, and so on. Bulgaria's President Stoyanov stressed
in 1998 that his country's NATO aspirations represented a
"civilizational choice". "For us", Stoyanov said, "it is a strongly
motivated choice, a cultural choice, a choice of civilization" (quoted
in Todorova 2003:230). That country's next President Parvanov (2004)
echoes this claim, emphasizing that NATO membership was important not
only as a security guarantee but also, and "more importantly", as a
recognition that Bulgaria subscribes to the values of democracy.8 The
narrative is a productive one. [Linking NATO membership to acceptance
by]{.underline}, and agency in, [the international system]{.underline},
[it constitutes that membership as an essential attribute of political
subjectivity]{.underline}.

#### Enlargement relies on integration of NATO in individual social life -- enables twin processes of militarization and imperial rights production

**Kuus 2007** (Merje, political geographer studying epistemology of
institutions, \"\'Love, Peace and Nato\': Imperial Subject-Making in
Central Europe,\" Antipode, Vol. 39, Issue 2, pg. 269-290, March 2007,
google scholar, accessed 7/6/2022, gdi-tmur)

Beyond Central Europe, the paper illuminates [the twin processes of
militarization and the production of imperial right]{.underline}. [Both
processes are]{.underline} at their core [concerned with
subject-making]{.underline}. [NATO enlargement]{.underline}, I argue,
[was based not merely on ignoring the public]{.underline}. [It was
also]{.underline} [based on making NATO into an unremarkable and
integral part of social life]{.underline}. [Accession was
effected]{.underline} not though negative categories of threat but
[through positive narratives of fully fledged politically active western
subjects]{.underline}. [It locates geopolitics at the scale of
individual action and individual identity]{.underline}. The [accession
discourse produces NATO membership as a state's precondition for
being]{.underline}---as [a requirement for being recognized as a modern,
mature western subject]{.underline}. [It constitutes NATO]{.underline}
[not just in terms of state action, but also in terms of individual
responsibility and individual emotions]{.underline}. [It constitutes the
military--industrial--media-- entertainment complex]{.underline} not
simply as necessary or inevitable but also [as morally
good]{.underline}. Within it, [accession is]{.underline} not something
that happens to people, that is [imposed on the electorate
for]{.underline} "[reasons of the state]{.underline}". [It is a
constructive process that emphasizes]{.underline} the [participation of
individuals and social groups]{.underline}. Recall the Birth-Day dance
in the Prague Castle, the references to responsible and reliable
subjects, the proclamations on a new beginning, freedom, and openness,
the calls for a proactive participation and emotional involvement in
security, and the emphasis on children and youth. [The
process]{.underline} is not concerned merely with putting individuals
into the service of power. It rather [seeks to integrate individuals
into its very functioning]{.underline}. [It works by enlarging the
unremarkable realms of consensus that underpin the normative space of
imperial right]{.underline}.

### 2NC NATO---History Structures Implementation

#### Hegemonic forms of knowledge unconsciously shape NATO's perceptions of collective security. The good intentions of the Aff cannot change the ways the plan would be implemented.

**da Mota**, PhD in IR at University of Coimbra, **2016** (Sarah
Carreira, \"NATO: upholding Civilisation, protecting Individuals. The
unconscious dimension of international security,\" University of
Coimbra, September 2016, google scholar, accessed 7/6/2022, gdi-tmur)

The above-quoted historian Fernand Braudel (1958) speaks of the
"unconscious history" -- l'histoire inconsciente -- that is, the
[history]{.underline} that [overcomes]{.underline} [the duration of a
single event in the most transcendent ways]{.underline}, [and carries
with it some imperceptible meanings that travel across
time]{.underline}. This [invisible and latent form of history suggests
that we have an unconscious perception of who we are, and of what we are
doing, independently of our specific temporal location]{.underline}.
However, this [unconsciousness mostly relates to the perspective of
short duration]{.underline}, i.e., of "micro-time" (Braudel, 1958: 739),
as short-term insights may veil our awareness in perceiving history more
widely. [This implies]{.underline}, on the contrary, that [when we think
of history in macro-time]{.underline}, or longer duration, [the
perception we have of it is rather conscious]{.underline}. Or, as
suggested by Reinhart Koselleck (2004) in Futures Past: on the semantics
of historical time: There certainly are also structures which are so
enduring that they remain for contemporaries part of the unconscious or
the unknown, or whose transformation is so slow that it escapes their
awareness. In these cases, only social science or history as a science
of the past can provide information that goes beyond the perceptible
experience of given generations (Koselleck, 2004: 108). The present
research arises from a fundamental concern over how [hegemonic forms of
knowledge have shaped not only collective perceptions and
representations of the world and its history in a way that dismisses the
importance of this unconscious history,]{.underline} [but also how they
have influenced their very becoming]{.underline}. More specifically,
[this concern is related to the direct impact those forms of knowledge
may have on]{.underline} the [prevailing readings and practices of
contemporary international security]{.underline}. The work undertaken in
[this research]{.underline} [focuses]{.underline} on the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation ([NATO]{.underline}) [as an object of
study]{.underline}, [in which the unconscious dimension of history is
fundamentally questioned and searched for in relation to international
security]{.underline}. The [pertinence of NATO to this]{.underline}
endeavour [draws upon the fact that alliances use to be temporary and
last only as long there is a specific threat to combat]{.underline}
(Wendt, 1994). Yet, [that is not NATO's case]{.underline}, [for it has
evolved from an alliance into a community]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [also from focusing on one specific threat to
unspecific risks]{.underline} (Adler, 2008; Coker, 2002; Mozaffari,
2002: 30; NATO, 1991). In fact, it has managed to overcome its original
compromise towards the safeguard of the civilisation of its people
(NATO, 1949), up until the more contemporary point of committing to
protecting individuals outside its original area of intervention (NATO,
2011). Therefore, [this study interrogates to what extent the seemingly
natural evolution of NATO's referent object of security]{.underline} --
[what it aims at securing]{.underline} -- [may be framed by unconscious
processes]{.underline}.2 The overall objective is to understand in more
depth the dynamics composing the still underexplored relationship within
security studies, and more broadly within International Relations (IR),
between the idea of civilisation and the place of individuality in it. 3
This will be done by making visible how [the security of civilisation
and the Individualisation of Security have been]{.underline}
(interrelatedly) [conceptualised and practiced throughout NATO's
evolution]{.underline}. The goal of this conceptual and practical
confrontation is to display an interdisciplinary interpretation -- IR,
political science, sociology, security studies, history, philosophy,
psychology -- of the actual importance of the individual to the becoming
of human societies, as well as the importance of structural action upon
this very becoming.

#### Liberal internationalism is a racialized and class-based ideological system that fails to accurately describe the world and is aimed at justifying Western global imperialism. Its defenders refuse to acknowledge studies that refute its core underlying assumptions.

As an IR theory, the key pillars of liberalism, as embodied in liberal

cooperation in addressing global crises and problems, and the broad
promotion of general welfare. Emerging historically from the era of
rising anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism, with the United States and
Britain in the lead, [the US-led order laid claims to being opposed to
colonial rule, and in favour of national and human rights, within a
system of international power undergirded by rules binding hegemon and
others alike.]{.underline} It was promoted not as a continuation of
empire by other means, but as a new system based on universalistic
principles applicable to all regardless of race, colour or history. For
my immediate purposes, it is unnecessary to disentangle the positive
from the normative, the theoretical from the practical, because this
framework of thought emerges both from deep principles and also as a set
of solutions to international problems, especially world wars. Hence,
liberal internationalism is frequently referred to as Wilsonianism,
after the internationalist programme promulgated by US President Woodrow
Wilson after the First World War that included the formation of the
League of Nations, the forerunner of the longer-lasting post-1945 United
Nations system. I argue here that, [as a theory, it operates as
ideological legitimation even when its proponents offer reform; it
justifies the status quo.]{.underline} In that regard it differs little
overall from other theories like Marxism, for example, or realism. But
because it is the principal system of ideas and practices, and ideals,
that are used to explain, implement and defend the present international
status quo, I would suggest that [it elides too much to be fully
validated beyond the circle of its proponents.]{.underline} Of course,
it explains aspects of the world's functioning; but its interpretation
tends to be benign: crises and challenges are explained as resolvable
within the system's governing principles through socialization,
integration and assimilation. I use the term liberal internationalism,
then, as an amalgam to suggest that, while it is all of the above, upon
reflection it serves within academia and in IR as a positive theory of
how things actually are---that is, as the opposite of an ideology. [It
purports to be able to explain the world]{.underline}, at the same time
as its adherents are normative supporters of the theory. I show that [it
is actually ideological, because it elides key factors of how the
liberal world order actually works, and that other theories suggest
better ways of explaining the world.]{.underline} In the next section of
the article, I analyse liberal internationalist ideas and claims in more
depth and more critically, with a view to identifying key elements of a
more viable framework to explain the LIO---a critical theory influenced
by the work of Antonio Gramsci and to some extent synthesized with the
work of Karl Kautsky. The principal aim of this article is to identify
the weaknesses of liberal internationalism in practice with the purpose
of opening space for subsequent theorizing. In sum, what appears to be
[missing from liberal internationalism is any recognition of domestic
power inequalities---such as those based on class and race---its broad
attachment to (democratic) elitism, and its hierarchical approach to
other powers, especially in the global South.]{.underline} While
[Wilsonian liberal internationalism is widely recognized as privileging
a belief in the free movement of people, capital, goods and services,
less attention has been given to its origins in a time when
'international relations' was overtly understood as 'race relations',
and its consequent implication in managing overtly racialized imperial
power after the First World War.]{.underline}14 The Wilson
administration's role in racially segregating the US federal government
had its foreign policy counterpart in a belief in an eventual, but far
distant, self-government of the colonies and opposition to a Japanese
proposal for a racial equality clause in the charter of the fledgling
League of Nations.15 [The development of liberal
internationalism]{.underline}, then, [was symbiotically bound to
Wilson's conviction that US intervention in world affairs was
essential]{.underline}, and to what were effectively parastatal
organizations created both by the federal executive and by private
foundations---the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, among
others. Wilsonian 'theory' was practical, idealistic and ideological
from the very beginning. It is also the case that, [long after overt
racial discourses became politically damaging, subliminal racial
thinking remained---and (unconsciously) remains---a significant element
of liberal internationalism, affecting its analyses of the politics of
domestic and global demographic power shifts]{.underline}.16
Nevertheless, liberal internationalists are cosmopolitans---opposed to
narrow nationalism and trade protectionism, within a US-led
international system. But its core ideas---rule of law, superiority of
the western idea (however lightly worn), a rules-based institutional
order open to all, in principle---are deeply embedded in US
political-intellectual elite think-tanks, university public policy
schools, corporate media and the leaderships of both main political
parties,17 the core of the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant establishment.18
Importantly, however, there are influential voices in the emerging
powers and regions that support the liberal international order by
calling for internal reform to take account of the changing distribution
of global power away from the West and towards the 'rest'.19 The upshot
is a broad consensus around certain core ideas: that the post-1945
rules-based world order, whatever its weaknesses, serves the world well
by spreading prosperity and maintaining peace; and that, although it
cannot continue unreformed[, the US-led system draws on deep
resources---economic, military, systemic and 'soft'---that bestow upon
it continuing strengths to contain, engage, manage and socialize
emerging powers.]{.underline} Charles Kupchan lists a range of problems
requiring US leadership, even if only within a suitably reformed
international system reflecting 'the real distribution of power'.20 John
Ikenberry of Princeton University, the leading proponent of this school
of thought, makes significant claims as well as several unquestioned
assumptions, undeveloped allusions to core powers' violent and other
connections with the periphery, and a number of significant silences. He
claims, for example, that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[is a fully functioning democracy, yet fails to acknowledge evidence of
the power of racialized, class-based elites]{.underline}. For critical
theorists, such as Robert Cox, Stephen Gill and Craig Murphy,21 [the
international relations of elites across states and societies operate to
reproduce extant patterns of power and manage or engineer change to the
benefit of elites in a generally zero-sum game in which broad masses and
lower classes lose out]{.underline}. This is clearly a far cry from
liberal internationalist claims associated with the benefits of
globalization, notwithstanding proposed ameliorative remedies against
the harshest effects. Likewise[, claims about the centrality of the rule
of law occlude consideration of significant violations in
practice]{.underline}. The question of imperial power is hardly
addressed, and [there is a general Eurocentric neglect of the
significance of global areas beyond the core to the 'welfare' and
cohesion of the core itself.]{.underline} There is a clear link between
Ikenberry's overt theory of American democracy and its liberal-hegemonic
world role. The United States, and the western order it built, is
characterized as a pluralistic liberal market democracy that is broadly
inclusive and tolerant of ethnic diversity. The US-built security
community exhibits its leading state's internal character as a plural
one and, very significantly, one in which the United States is bound by
rules.22 Yet **[liberal internationalists' underlying assumptions
effectively deny the findings of numerous well-researched studies
challenging American democracy's principal claims]{.underline}**.23 As
far as Ikenberry and Deudney (and many others) are concerned, the
'western idea' is a significant part of the strength of the US-led
order.24 The West, a spectacularly successful 'civilizational heritage',
was underpinned by America's New Deal liberalism, and extended globally
via Bretton Woods, the Marshall Plan and NATO. In effect, this vision
and programme aimed to defuse domestic class conflict and the threat of
war through 'activist government, political democracy, and international
alliance'. That system is in principle capable of assimilating emerging
powers, given the universalism of its values and its tolerance of ethnic
differences, although others joining this privileged grouping are
expected to conform to its rules and accept US leadership. [Western
order is exclusive]{.underline} also [because special rules apply within
its zone of peace. Beyond it]{.underline}, conversely, [other rules
apply---cruder, neo-imperial and violent, although the implications of
this contrast are left unaddressed.2]{.underline}5 By drawing a line
around the West, Ikenberry cuts off the rest of the world while
addressing questions about the sources of world order which,
empirically, lie in a symbiotic relationship between core and periphery.
Yet, even within the 'greater' West, Japan and South Korea were not
accorded the same treatment as western Europe.26 [The LIO]{.underline}
really [was conceived and developed as a system of the West and the
rest, in a zero-sum game]{.underline}. As Donald Tusk, President of the
European Council, noted on Twitter in May 2017, [the whole point of
'Euro-Atlanticism' was to 'prevent post-West world
order']{.underline}.27 [Yet the claim persists that this is no empire,
despite America's privileged place at the top of the 'hierarchical
political order', because its hegemony is built on 'consent' and bounded
by law.]{.underline} Power, which was necessary at the creation, faded
away as consensual hegemony developed. [This
interpretation]{.underline}, of course, [elides America's overwhelming
military superiority, including in and over Europe. Beyond
Europe]{.underline}, however, Ikenberry concedes that [American hegemony
remained hierarchical, 'with much fainter liberal
characteristics]{.underline}',28 [again closing off an avenue of
analytical and empirical analysis that might threaten the intellectual
edifice of the LIO.]{.underline} The (unconsciously) racialized
world-view of Ikenberry's Eurocentrism is subtly buttressed by Walter
Russell Mead's exploration of the significance of superior Anglo-Saxons
who win wars, build world structures, and govern efficiently owing to
ethno-cultural, not biological, characteristics.29 Mead's interpretation
of Anglo-Saxonism makes it appear benign, assimilative and universal---
a scaffolding to support Ikenberry's more overtly institutional
analysis. Assimilating minorities, however, is not embracing
diversity---learning from other cultures and creating something new; it
is maintaining conformity to the cultures of the powerful, dominant
group.30 Looking to the future, [as new global powers
emerge]{.underline}, Mead advises [America]{.underline} to both [embrace
and contain them]{.underline}, [retaining military superiority should
'rising' powers become 'opponents']{.underline}.31 Mead complements the
prescriptions of other liberal-realist internationalists, all seeking to
incorporate, assimilate and mobilize emerging powers to absorb
difference and produce conformity. The liberal view is challenged by
scholars who argue that the New Deal order effectively represented a
political compromise, made in order to attain class peace and greater
productivity, that mainly benefited major corporations while
incorporating organized labour and thereby drawing its teeth. The
postwar settlement was a narrow one---excluding racial minorities,
unskilled and unorganized labour, and women---and relied on war and a
heavily militarized economy that arose with the war in Korea and led
directly to that in Vietnam.32 [Liberal internationalists' accounts
elide]{.underline} the [class, gendered and racial bases of the order,
both at home and abroad]{.underline}. Ikenberry paints an appealing
picture of a liberal order that delivered material benefits and security
to all, while also raising some doubts about the operation of the
system, especially with regard to the inequality of rewards generated by
globalization and its potential political consequences. Those
consequences are regarded by Ikenberry as posing the greatest threats to
the stability of the liberal order, laying bare [a central mechanism and
dynamic of the system itself: market-driven class inequality,
exacerbated in a society in which racialized class politics is
salient.]{.underline}33 Yet Ikenberry never mentions class, race or
gender---an omission central to critical theories of the making of the
LIO.34 The other key omission is the role played in building the order
by violence and outright war---not just the Second World War but also
the Korean War, the 'hot' war at the birth of the order that propelled
the formation of NATO, the rearmament of Germany, the security alliance
with Japan and indeed the US military-- industrial complex.35
Accordingly, a key focus of consideration here is wartime planning for a
new world order and the manner of its foundation as a direct result of
military violence that violated the UN Charter, international law, the
lessons of the Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes trials, and the 1949
Geneva Conventions. Wars 'out there' secured the core 'over here'.36
And, of course, what is referred to as benign '[**liberal
internationalism' is**]{.underline} what Mark Mazower refers to as
'[**imperial internationalism'---trying to maintain a global hierarchy
established by centuries of colonial and semi-colonial rule over what is
now called the global South.37**]{.underline} Finally, the construction
of the postwar western order was constitutive of a political, social,
economic and ideological 'vital center', as Schlesinger terms
it38---opposed to both right-wing nationalists and left-wing
anti-imperialists. This entailed the acceptance by core forces of the
'New Deal order' that [the price of class harmony, stability and
mobility at home was the export and continuation of inequality,39 and
therefore military violence, on the periphery; and that the removal of
vast quantities of raw materials required a global military basing
strategy, both to protect allied trade and to deny it to
adversaries.]{.underline}40 [Ikenberry]{.underline} accurately notes
that the internal character of the leading state in the liberal order
has an impact on the international system it built; but I diverge from
his presentation of this impact as the externalization of a democratic
regime. He [elides the racial, class and gendered character of American
historical, economic and political development---including that of
Wilsonianism itself.]{.underline}41 His conclusion, however, is
accurate, even if he fails to recognize its significance in the building
and maintenance of the liberal order: '[Access to resources and markets,
socioeconomic stability, political pluralism, and American security
interests---all were inextricably linked.]{.underline}'42

[The foundational values, interests and institutions of the]{.underline}
(Anglo-)[US liberal international order]{.underline}, with due respect
for important but not fundamental recalibrations and corrections along
the way[, are the sources of its current crises]{.underline} or at least
challenges. [The mentalities and power structures of the
LIO]{.underline}'s leaders [are constructed by hierarchical, imperial
and racial--civilizational ways of thinking]{.underline}, albeit in most
cases subliminally [embedded to the point of being unconscious deep
structures]{.underline} themselves.117 The American white Anglo-Saxon
Protestant (Wasp) establishment built and maintained the liberal order
in a 'competitively cooperative' alliance with their British
counterparts,118 whose own imperial and racial mentalities were hardly
in conflict with those of their American cousins.119 Whatever changes
occurred or were forced on US elites over time, those [underlying and
mainly subliminal values have remained significant in decision-making,
including when nurturing new states and powers such as South Korea and
China.]{.underline} As a result, [liberal internationalism as a 'theory'
or approach to world order, eliding and skirting matters of hierarchy,
race and class]{.underline} just as it does in its outline
understandings of American democracy, [misses a critical part of the
picture---of the dynamics of international power as well as the dynamics
of domestic power]{.underline}. Because of that elision, that failure to
see, I suggest [it is a]{.underline} [legitimating ideology of the
American ruling elite]{.underline}. I have argued above that [the LIO is
better understood as a system of hierarchy and inequality, and
as]{.underline} what Persaud calls [a 'racio-civilizational'
phenomenon]{.underline}. What does that mean? It means that [this system
and its leaders cannot yet comprehend an order that encompasses on the
basis of something approaching equality the broad mass of
people---citizens---at home, let alone the non-western peoples of the
global South, or even their elites]{.underline}. The tweet from Donald
Tusk quoted above is revealing and instructive because it was addressed
to President Trump in simple and stark terms, worth repeating here:
'Euro-Atlanticism means the free world cooperating to prevent post-West
world order'---so, please 'do not touch'. [International alliances of
elites, including]{.underline} those of the [emerging powers such as
China, are in large part attempts to manage and channel change to
prevent radical power shifts, to sustain a world order that serves
elites and masses, in West and East, in starkly unequal
ways]{.underline}. A Gramscian--Kautskyian synthesis combines
consideration of domestic and international class-based imperial
hegemonies and offers a good explanation of the existing order. However,
it also offers a way out, in theory, and provides ways to assess the
likelihood of avenues towards egalitarianism being taken by ruling
elites. The prognosis is not positive at present, although the bases of
ways forward appear to be coming into view as political strife and
electoral shocks challenge the status quo.120

It is widely agreed that [the US-led liberal international
order]{.underline} (LIO) [is]{.underline} at the very least [in
transition, if not in crisis.]{.underline}1 This article raises
[a]{.underline} number of [significant question]{.underline}s with the
aim of clarifying the current conjuncture in the US-led LIO, with
particular attention to the academic 'theory' (liberal internationalism)
that underpins the system. Above all, it [asks: is liberal
internationalism a legitimating ideology more than it is a description
or theoretical explanation of the existing system?]{.underline} I
explore this question by considering several specific sub-questions, the
cumulative effect of which is to provide pathways to address the main
issue: How did we get here? Who built the order? What were the
foundational principles in theory and practice? How has the
international order's leadership managed change within it since 1945? I
address these questions by considering detailed examples of actual
practice by US and allied elite leadership groups at key moments: first,
in conceptualizing and building the order, both during and immediately
after the Second World War, by exploring the creation of the South
Korean state; and second, in looking at the management of change and
challenges---in particular, the (re-)emergence of China as a Great
Power. Both cases are claimed by leading liberal internationalists as
primary examples of the successes of the LIO: hence, examining these
cases in some detail allows us to compare liberal internationalist
rationales---and the stated aims of policy-makers---with historical and
contemporary evidence. The overall finding is that [liberal
internationalist thinking/theory is]{.underline}, in effect (albeit
unconsciously on the part of its proponents), [a legitimating ideology
rather than an effective explanatory frame for understanding the way in
which the LIO actually works. That]{.underline} conclusion is reached,
in part, by suggesting the applicability of a rather different
perspective on the operations of the LIO and US power: specifically, a
synthesized Gramscian--Kautskyian framework, explained below. The key
point is that [the LIO is a class-based, elitist hegemony---strongly
imbued with explicit and implicit racial and colonial/imperial
assumptions---in both US domestic and foreign relations.]{.underline} At
home, [this analysis helps to explain in part the phenomenon of the
'left behind' white working/middle class, including the affluent but
economically anxious voters whose salience on the right has transformed
US politics]{.underline} since the Reagan revolution of the 1980s.2
Responding to the (minorities') rights revolution of the 1960s, and the
loss of economic opportunity and decline in living standards due to
technological change and the global redistribution of industry,3 white
working- and middle-class voters drifted towards the Republicans as the
party of low taxes and fiscal conservatism.4 This delivered little in
material terms, however; and, [as inequality increased with market
freedom and real wages stagnated, workers in the 'rust belt' and other
areas grew increasingly dissatisfied with the status quo of
establishment politics, their frustration exacerbated by anxieties about
ethno-racial diversity and American identity as the United States moves
towards a society in which whites are a minority.]{.underline}5 The
result was the election as president in 2016 of Donald Trump on an
overtly anti-conservative and barely concealed white identity platform
at home and a programme of protectionism and
non-interventionism---America First---abroad.6 [Yet political
dissatisfaction or disaffection was not confined to the political
right.]{.underline}7 'Occupy Wall Street' and other movements and groups
vented their anger at the inequalities of power, wealth and income,
particularly in the wake of the Iraq War and the 2008 financial crisis.8
In external policy, [the analysis helps to explain]{.underline} the
difficulty, perhaps [the impossibility, of the US readily embracing a
more diverse international order]{.underline}, as well as the character
of that very embrace.9 [Accepting nations of the global South on an
equal footing]{.underline} may become a strategic necessity, but the
process [remains problematic given the racialized discourses of western
power over the past several centuries, fortified in the United
States]{.underline} by the experience of the slave trade, slavery, the
'Jim Crow' era, Orientalist views of Asians, and other factors.10 [Class
power helps to explain the strategic embrace of foreign elites as the
sources of change and the agents of American influence,]{.underline}
however diluted it may have been due to target states' national interest
considerations. [Those at the apex of America's hierarchies sought to
forge alliances with and incorporate their foreign elite
counterparts]{.underline}--- with their full cooperation---in South
Korea and China.11 Hence, [the liberal internationalist
'successes']{.underline} in the cases of South Korea and China [must be
qualified by considering the repercussions of developing market-oriented
societies marked by economic inequality, rising social unrest and
varying degrees of political repression.]{.underline} In 'successful'
China and South Korea, as in India and other emerging powers, [there
remain major challenges underpinned by profound inequalities in power,
wealth and income, associated with a politics that is frequently
class-based but also heavily racialized and xenophobic.]{.underline}12
Why choose South Korea and China as key cases? Although these are two
very different states, varying in global significance, and analysed at
different periods of historical time, they do allow us to test out
important claims made by liberal internationalists. South Korea is
considered as a key test at the very birth of the US-led order---at a
time when we might expect the new principles embodied in the UN, such as
the rule of law, the lessons of the Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes
trials, the Geneva Conventions and the rights of civilians in combat
zones, to be pursued with some determination if not fully achieved.
Given the fervour of anti-colonialism at the time, and US claims to
champion that cause, we might also expect the behaviour of the
international system's leading power to differ sharply from that of
colonial rulers in what became known as the Third World. The case of
South Korea tells us a great deal about the practical application of a
new international system developed by US power within an international
system of rules, applicable to hegemon and others alike, a key liberal
internationalist claim. [China's integration into the US-led
international system]{.underline} from the late 1970s also [tells us a
great deal about the character of the international order]{.underline},
especially about [how significant change is managed within it and what
the embrace of diversity means in practical terms.]{.underline} By the
1970s, the US-led order was facing challenges, of course---from West
Germany and Japan, for example, and the oil-producing states---not to
mention demands from the G77 for a New International Economic Order
(NIEO), and was also recovering from defeat in Vietnam and the
legitimacy crisis following the Watergate scandal. For liberal
internationalists, the integration of China is claimed as a success
story both for the liberal order and for China. Yet, without denying the
country's dramatic increase in economic power, I question the character
of China's success, given the [high levels of internal turmoil and the
extremes of inequality that are giving rise to major political and
economic instability.]{.underline} China, then, is a test of the claim
that the liberal order rewards societies as a whole; a
Gramscian--Kautskyian counter-argument would suggest that [it is largely
the]{.underline} Chinese [ruling elite and its business
allies]{.underline}, not the mass of ordinary Chinese, [who have been
accommodated in the US-led international system.]{.underline}

The article draws in part from the work of David Campbell who suggests
that [**dangers in the international realm are invariably threats to
understandings about the self**. 'The mere existence of an alternative
mode of being',]{.underline} argues Campbell, '[the presence of which
exemplifies that different identities are possible . . . is sometimes
enough to produce the understanding of a threat.']{.underline}19 As a
result[, interpretations of global danger can be traced to the processes
by which states are made foreign from one another through discourses of
separation and difference]{.underline}.20 In this analysis it is
demonstrated that particular [American discourses have historically made
the US foreign from China]{.underline}. Case study one for example
demonstrates that **[nineteenth century racial discourses of non-white
immigrant Chinese separated China from a United States largely defined
by its presumed Caucasian foundations]{.underline}**. In case study two
we see that [Cold War ideological discourses of communism distanced the
PRC from the democratic-capitalist US]{.underline}. These types of
discourses are shown to have constituted a 'specific sort of boundary
producing political performance'.21 Across the history of Sino-US
relations then when ['dangers' from China]{.underline} have emerged,
they [have always been perceived through the lens of American
identity]{.underline}. In consequence, they have always existed as
dangers to that identity. In this analysis it is argued that [a key
purpose of depicting China as a threat has been to protect components of
American identity (primarily racial and ideological) deemed most
fundamental to its being]{.underline}. As such, **[representations of a
threatening China have]{.underline}** most commonly [been advanced by,
and served the interests of, those who support actions to defend that
identity]{.underline}. The case study analyses which follow reveal that
this has included [politicians and policymaking circles]{.underline},
such as those within the administration of President Harry Truman which
[implemented]{.underline} the [Cold War containment]{.underline} of the
PRC. It also exposes the complicity of [other societal individuals and
institutions]{.underline} including elements of the late
nineteenth-century American media which [supported restrictions against
Chinese immigration to the western United States.]{.underline} It is
demonstrated that, twice before, this discursive process of separating
China from the United States has resulted in a crisis of American
identity. [Crises of identity occur when the existing order is
considered in danger of rupture. The prevailing authority is seen to be
weakened and rhetoric over how to reassert the 'natural' identity
intensifies]{.underline}.22 Case studies one and two expose how such
crises have previously emerged. [These moments were characterised by
perceived attacks upon **core assumptions about what the United States
was understood to be: fundamentally white in the late nineteenth
century** and democratic-capitalist in the early Cold War]{.underline}.
Case study three shows that while today's China 'threat' to US security
is yet to generate such a crisis, we must learn from those of the past
to help avoid the types of consequences they have previously
facilitated.

In March 2011 US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper
informed the American Senate that, of all sovereign nations, China
represented the most imminent 'mortal threat' to the United States.
While China's intentions were not necessarily malicious, he argued, it
had the capacity to present such a danger. Russia was also cited but
quickly dismissed as Clapper observed that China's 'strategic nuclear
weapons' arsenal in particular made it an issue of the foremost
concern.1 China's nuclear weapons stockpile is estimated at around 240
warheads. Russia's stands at around 12,000.2 Yet, and despite the clear
superiority of the latter's nuclear armament, Clapper repeatedly
emphasised that it was China's capabilities and not its intent which
were central in its elevation to such an extreme category of threat.
Director Clapper's assertions are reflective of **[the so-called China
Threat Theory]{.underline}** which now **[attracts considerable Western
attention, especially within the United States]{.underline}**. In the
[International Relations (IR) literature]{.underline} authors including
John Mearsheimer examine US policy options towards a real or potential
China threat. Mearsheimer [argues that China's growth will almost
inevitably cause tensions with the United States]{.underline},
presenting a 'considerable potential for war'.3 Warren Cohen predicts
[that China will continue to 'brutaliz\[e\] the weak', and follow great
powers of the past by seeking regional dominance before expanding its
influence further]{.underline}.4 Certainly, much of the recent
literature is less foreboding of China's 'rise' and authors question the
extent to which it endangers international security. Gordon Chang, for
example, argues that China's economic model -- and hence its capacity to
become a true global superpower -- is flawed.5 Brown et al. are broadly
positive about China's development, with engagement rather than
containment the preferred US policy response.6 Others reject the
conflation of a 'rising' China with a 'dangerous' China.7 What
protagonists of both sides of the argument demonstrate in equal measure,
however, is the tendency to assume that a single physical reality about
China can be determined. [This aim of classifying China as a
threat]{.underline} (or indeed a non-threat) [is a legacy of the
historical dominance within IR of the overtly positivist neorealist and
neoliberal schools]{.underline}.8 Positivist approaches to the
discipline rely upon testable theory and empirical analysis with the
expectation that the world can be definitively understood. The
traditional influence of these approaches has precluded a more
widespread appreciation of how, in fact, a single authoritative
understanding about China is unachievable. The inherent contestability
and subjectivity of judgments about that country was once noted by John
King Fairbank who argued that '\[a\]t any given time the ''truth'' about
China is in our heads'.9 From this understanding [**the existence (or
absence) of a China threat** cannot be satisfactorily explained with
reference to material forces alone. The 'threat']{.underline} described
by Director Clapper **[can never be dispassionately observed through
assessments of an external world,]{.underline}** as he seemingly claimed
to be able to do. The purpose of this article is not to speculate as to
whether China 'is' or 'is not' a threat to the United States. It does
not concern itself with China's nuclear arsenal nor dispute the
existence and expansion of its capabilities, or the possibility of there
being a cause of future violence. It argues that **[while the material
realities of China are important, the nature and extent of their
importance is, and has always been, regulated by ideas]{.underline}**.
Of course, the understanding that international affairs are guided by
more than the distribution of state capabilities is not original; it has
long been a primary contestation of the 'critical', or post-positivist,
IR movement that the world is mutually constitutive of material and
ideational forces.10 Moreover, authors including Evelyn Goh emphasise
the centrality of ideas within Sino-US relations and to the formulation
of US China policy at key moments.11 Chengxin Pan specifically examines
[the China 'threat' as a discursive construction]{.underline} and its
importance to Washington's relations with Beijing.12 Beyond these
important works the discipline remains relatively quiet on **[the
salience of ideational forces in producing a fantasised China 'threat'
and in enabling US policies in response]{.underline}**.13 It also
broadly fails to explain how [those policies themselves reinforce the
understandings which make them possible in the first place.]{.underline}
This is the arena of enquiry towards which the article is directed. It
contributes to a small but growing literature which challenges the
contours of the modern day China Threat Theory, exposing it as
fundamentally flawed and even potentially dangerous. It does this by
demonstrating that, [**in many respects, today's China 'threat' to US
security conforms to those which have emerged before**.]{.underline} It
shows how, [across the duration of Sino-US relations, China 'threats'
have always emerged in part from representation and interpretation and
thus how fears about that country today continue to be manufactured and
engineered in a way not unique from those of the (sometimes distant)
past]{.underline}. In late 2011 [the]{.underline} [Obama
administration]{.underline} shifted its foreign policy focus from
Afghanistan and Iraq to the [Asia Pacific]{.underline}.14 To a
significant extent this '[pivot']{.underline}, as it is commonly
described[, is motivated by the growth of China]{.underline}.
Accordingly, [as increasing concentrations of US political, economic,
and military recourses are diverted to the Asian region, American
perceptions of China and their significance to the enactment of
Washington's foreign policies there have once more become increasingly
pertinent.]{.underline}

#### China threat discourses are inherently socially constructed -- they justify demands for action and create self-fulfilling prophecies

[The modern day China 'threat' to the United States is not an
unproblematic, neutrally verifiable phenomenon. It is an imagined
construction of]{.underline} American design and the product of
[societal representations which]{.underline}, to a significant extent,
[have established the truth that a 'rising' China endangers US
security.]{.underline} This is an increasingly acknowledged, but still
relatively under-developed, concept within the literature.121 The
purpose of this article has been to expose how 'threats' from China
towards the United States have always been contingent upon subjective
interpretation. The three case studies chosen represent those moments
across the lifetime of Sino-US relations at which China has been
perceived as most threatening to American security. The 'threats'
emerged in highly contrasting eras. The nature of each was very
different and they emerged from varying sources (broadly speaking, from
immigration in the nineteenth century and from 'great power' rivalry in
the twentieth and twenty-first centuries). Yet in this way they most
effectively demonstrate how China 'threats' have repeatedly existed as
socially constructed phenomenon. Collectively **[they reveal the
consistent centrality of understandings about the United States in
perceptions of external danger.]{.underline}** They demonstrate that,
[regardless of China's ability to assert material force or of the manner
in which it has been seen to impose itself upon the United States, the
reality of danger can be manufactured and made real]{.underline}. China
'threats' have always been threats to American identity so that the
individual sources of 'danger' -- whether a nuclear capability or an
influx of (relatively few) foreign immigrants -- have never been the
sole determining factors. As James Der Derian notes, [danger can be
ascribed to otherness wherever it may be found]{.underline}.122 During
the mid-to-late nineteenth century and throughout the early Cold War,
perceptions of China 'threats' provoked crises of American identity. The
twenty-first-century China 'threat' is yet to be understood in this way
but it remains inexplicable in simple material terms. As ever, the
physical realities of China are important but they are interpreted in
such a way to make them threatening, regardless of Beijing's intentions.
Most importantly, this article has shown how [processes of
representation have been complicit at every stage of the formulation,
enactment, and justification of US China policy]{.underline}. Their
**[primary purpose has been to dislocate China's identity from that of
the United States and introduce opportunities for action]{.underline}**.
Further, [those policies themselves have reaffirmed]{.underline} the
[discourses of separation and difference]{.underline} which make China
foreign from the United States, protecting American identity from the
imagined threat. Ultimately, this analysis has sought to expose the
inadequacy of approaches to the study of US China policy which privilege
and centralise material forces to the extent that ideas are subordinated
or even excluded. Joseph Nye argues that [the China Threat Theory has
the potential to become a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}. Based
upon a crude hypothetical assumption that there exists a 50 per cent
chance of China becoming aggressive and a 50 per cent chance of it not,
Nye explains, to treat China as an enemy now effectively discounts 50
per cent of the future.123 In such way he emphasises [the ideational
constitution of material forces and the power of discourse]{.underline}
to [create selected truths about the world so that certain courses of
action are enabled while others are precluded]{.underline}. Assessments
such as those of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in
March 2011 should therefore not only be considered misguided, but also
potentially dangerous. For while they appear to represent authoritative
statements of fact they actually rely upon subjective assumptions about
China and the material capabilities he describes. In late 2010 President
Obama informed Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao that 'the American people
\[want\] to continue to build a growing friendship and strong
relationship between the peoples of China and the United States'.124 The
hope, of course, is that a peaceful and cooperative future can be
secured. Following the announcement that the Asia Pacific is to
constitute the primary focus of Washington's early twenty-first-century
foreign policy strategy, American interpretations of China must be
acknowledged as a central force within an increasingly pertinent
relationship. The basis of their relations will always be fundamentally
constituted by ideas and history informs us that particular American
discourses of China have repeatedly served to construct vivid and
sometimes regrettable realities about that country and its people.
Crucially, it tells us that they have always been inextricable from the
potentialities of US China policy. As Sino-US relations become
increasingly consequential [the intention must be for American
representations of the PRC -- and indeed Chinese representations of the
United States -- to become the focus of more concerted scholarly
attention. Only in this way can the contours of those relations be more
satisfactorily understood, so that the types of historical episodes
explored in this analysis might somehow be avoided in the
future.]{.underline}

### Link---China Rise

#### Representations of a "rising China" are a socially constructed narrative of dramatic great power tensions

**Turner 2013** \[Oliver, Research Associate at the Brooks World Poverty
Institute at the University of Manchester, "'Threatening' China and US
security: the international politics of identity," *Review of
International Studies* 39.4, https://bit.ly/3ofH5TD, accessed 07/11/22,
GDI-ATN\]

China's military and economic strengths are far greater today than at
any point in the history of Sino-US relations. Yet, the 'threat' it
presents to American security is no less a social construction than in
the past. **[The modern day proliferation of]{.underline}** popular and
academic '**[China threat' literatures]{.underline}** in particular
**[is reflective of the increasingly widespread conviction that a
'rising' China inevitably constitutes a real or potential
danger.]{.underline}**97 Robert [Kaplan explains that 'the American
military contest with China in the Pacific will define the twenty first
century']{.underline}.98 He **[does not question if or even when China
might become a threat. He emphasises its inevitability.]{.underline}**
Babbin and Timperlake [provide a fictional **narrative of future
Sino-American tensions**]{.underline} in which, among other things,
China uses cyber warfare to shut down American defence systems. [The
hostile scenario they present, it is argued, 'could easily become fact .
. . The Verdict: China means war.']{.underline}99 Certainly, and as has
been the case throughout history, China is not uniformly perceived in
these terms. Among a significant proportion of the American population,
however, the China 'threat' is an accepted and relatively unproblematic
phenomenon. [China now has the world's largest population, the fastest
growing economy, the largest army, the largest middle class, a permanent
seat on the UN Security Council, a manned space program and a nuclear
arsenal.100 Yet, all of these things do not necessarily make China a
threat]{.underline}. [Countries which share variations of these,
notably]{.underline} the possession of [nuclear weapons, a permanent
presence in the Security Council and significant standing armies are not
perceived in this way]{.underline}. Indeed, and as Director Clapper
revealed in the Senate in early 2011, [states like Russia with far
greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons and significant additional
military hardware can be viewed in less threatening terms]{.underline},
even when capability is cited as the critical factor.101 Furthermore,
the PRC has had a large population and a substantial army since its
founding in 1949, nuclear weapons since 1964 and a seat on the Security
Council since 1971 without consistently being interpreted as a threat.
Accordingly, [forces additional to those of China's capabilities must
still be implicated in understandings about the dangers it is said to
present]{.underline}.

### Link---China Cyber

#### Depictions of Chinese cyber attacks invoke an orientalist narrative that hypocritically casts China as a "threat to civilization" 

**Ooi 2009** \[Su-Mei, associate Professor of Political Science at
Butler University, \"The Transnational Protection Regime and Taiwan\'s
Democratization,\" *Journal of East Asian Studies*, 9.1, ebscohost,
GDI-ATN\]

The construction of China as potential enemy Other takes on an
additional hue when we look at the depictions of China's cyber
activities---China moves from cheat to a more malicious cousin, the
thief. The United States first focused on issues of "cyber warfare" in
the mid-2000s to late 2000s, but at the time, the trope associated with
China was not necessarily that of thief. In the mass news media, [a
militaristic lens framed much of the discussion, depicting China as a
rule breaker flouting international norms and thus posing a security
threat]{.underline}. For example, a Los Angeles Times article
highlighted that "China in the last year has developed ways to
infiltrate and manipulate computer networks around the world in what
U.S. defense officials conclude is a new and potentially dangerous
military capability, according to a Pentagon report" (Barnes, 2008).
[China is even placed in relation to al-Qaeda: "Cyber-attacks and
cyber-espionage pose a greater potential danger to U.S. national
security than Al Qaeda and other militants that have dominated America's
global focus since Sept. 11, 2001]{.underline}, the nation's top
intelligence officials said Tuesday" (Dilanian, 2013).
[This]{.underline} juxtaposition with al-Qaeda [only served to heighten
the military valence of China's cyber activities]{.underline}, and a
push to prepare for such a threat. Indeed, in the words of Senator Bill
Nelson (D-FL): "The threat, to be sure, is real---and, we cannot allow
ourselves to grow complacent ..." (Nelson 2008). [Snowden's revelations
of US spying on China in June of 2013 drastically changed the shape of
the discussion however]{.underline}. Snowden demonstrated that the NSA
(1) had two data centers in China from which it had been inserting spy
software into vulnerable computers; (2) targeted the Chinese University
of Hong Kong, public officials, businesses, and students; (3) hacked
mobile phones; and (4) in 2009, hacked the Pacnet headquarters in Hong
Kong, which runs one of the biggest regional fibre-optic networks. In
response to Snowden's revelations, a spate of articles compared the
United States' and China's hacking, displaying a range of attitudes from
journalists---[some espoused that both countries demonstrate equivalent
transgressive behavior, while others argued that China has crossed the
line into more aggressive hacking that goes beyond the United States'
more benign "preemptive" hacking. **The latter attitude indicates the
resilience of tropes of the Yellow and Red Perils, a China whose
inherent ideological and cultural differences with the West makes it a
threat.**]{.underline} The different lenses through which journalists
and pundits viewed China's spying in comparison with that of the United
States further invoke this Orientalist demarcation. An article in The
Washington Post thus contrasts China's behavior against that of the
United States, which merely seeks "to examine huge amounts of
communication metadata around the world to look for trends" and "to
preempt some threat against the U.S." China's spying is described,
however, as "infiltrating almost every powerful institution in
Washington, D.C.," "breaking into major news organizations," "stealing
sensitive military technology," and "stealing so much intellectual
property that China's hacking has been [called the 'greatest transfer of
wealth in history'" (Fisher, 2013). Drawing]{.underline} in particular
on incendiary words like "stealing" and "infiltrating," this article
distinguishes China as a sneaky thief. US journalists and pundits, in
charging China with stealing economic resources, have further solidified
the demarcation of China as an inferior and dangerous Other. A
well-circulated quote by national security pundit Adam Segal stated,
"The problem is we're not talking about the same things ... We're trying
to make a distinction between cyber economic espionage and normal
political- military espionage. The Chinese don't make that same
distinction" (Bengali & Dilanian, 2015). **[By portraying China as
unable to grasp the fundamental distinction between economics and
national security, Segal suggests China's thievery is connected to a
more fundamental character flaw]{.underline}**---China is unable to
grasp proper civilized norms. Similarly, [US official response has been
that China's view of data collection as a sovereign right has rendered
them essentially different from the United States and by implication,
the civilized world.]{.underline} That Chinese governmental espionage
involves the collection of economic intelligence that is shared with
Chinese companies further departs from civilized norms. Michael Rogers,
Director of the National Security Agency thus explained that "they
clearly don't have the same lines in the sand, if you will, with that
regard" (Bennett, 2015). Historically, US depictions of China as
uncivilized have occurred whenever China has gained power or threatened
US interests. [The narrative of China as a sort of child]{.underline}
following in the United States' footsteps on the path to modernity has
proven exceedingly popular since World War II and **[frames the US
approach to China as a potential ally and resource who at the same time
may never be civilizable]{.underline}** (Kim, 2010; Vukovich, 2012). In
**[this Orientalist narrative, China's journey to modernity is always
understood as precarious and, moreover, subject to US
vigilance]{.underline}** as to whether it meets the appropriate
benchmarks. The title of an editorial in The Washington Post epitomizes
current iterations of this sentiment and the ease with which Orientalist
imagery can be invoked to portray China's path to modernity as needing
US guidance when China falls out of line: "The US Needs to Tame the
Cyber-Dragon: Stronger Measures are Need\[ed\] to Block China's Economic
Espionage \[emphasis mine\]" ("The U.S. Needs to Tame," 2013). In
reality, [US vigilance can be attributed to the concern since the end of
the Cold War, that a "sleeping giant" able to challenge US global
hegemony is awakening]{.underline} (Kim, 2010). Thus, [the cultural work
done by portrayals of China as unable to adhere to civilized norms serve
to bolster the image of China as perpetually unprepared to be a
responsible member of the international community]{.underline}. In fact,
this narrative of China's thievery serves to persuade the American
public that China is a threat to the international community. One Wall
Street Journal journalist perfectly echoes this sentiment: A China that
leads the world in the theft of intellectual property, computer hacking
and resource nationalism will prove extremely destabilizing. If it
continues on this course, Beijing should not be surprised if other
countries begin to band together to collectively counter some of the
more harmful implications of China's rise. A better outcome for all will
be for China to embrace its responsibilities to help lead the world ...
(Metzl, 2011) [This]{.underline} article, [although hopeful that China
may at some future point become a responsible global actor, even leader,
ultimately reifies the notion that an increase in China's global power
is always suspect.]{.underline}

### Link---SCS & ECS Scenarios

#### ECS and SCS scenario construction relies on tropes of a lawless China -- justifies US aggression and manifest destiny

China as lawless bully: maritime disputes To cheat and thief, [we can
layer the trope of lawlessness, readily employed in media
representations and political rhetoric over maritime territorial
and]{.underline} EEZ [disputes involving China and its neighbors in the
Western Pacific]{.underline}. China's territorial claims in the South
China Sea are largely historical in nature and do encroach on the 200
nautical miles EEZ of neighboring countries such as the Philippines and
Vietnam. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
does not expressly prohibit land reclamation in the sea as long as due
notice is given to other concerned states and due regard to the rights
of other states (Art. 60.3, 56.2, and 56.3) is taken into account, while
the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment is
observed (Art. 192). Parties to a dispute are also obligated to refrain
from acting in a manner that would jeopardize or hamper a final
agreement resolving the dispute (Art. 74.3 and 83.3). The frantic
building of artificial islands to enhance the legality of China's
claims, unilateral installations, and skirmishes in the disputed areas
are thus amenable to interpretation as lawless bullying. An editorial in
the Wall Street Journal titled "Calling Out China's Lawlessness; The US
Points Out that Beijing's Claims to the South China Sea Don't Stand Up,"
describes the "sketchy legality of its \[Beijing's\] actions" and claims
that "China is changing the status quo in the South China Sea with force
and the threat of force" ("Calling Out," 2014). This characterization in
the media is consistent with political rhetoric. US Secretary of State
John Kerry was reported to have said in May 2014 that China's
"introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters
disputed with Vietnam was provocative" (Ives & Fuller, 2014). Eliot
Engel of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee framed
China's actions in skirmishes with Vietnam as "needless provocations"
(Engel, 2014). At the same time, media representations and political
rhetoric have tended to obscure the fact that China's regional neighbors
all built airstrips and outposts on the claimed islands long before
China ever did. China also displays inconsistent behavior in that it has
reached agreements with Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin and South Korea in
the Yellow Sea to divide fisheries equally and carry out joint
enforcement patrols in keeping with international law.3 Indeed, China
has in land disputes signed "fair and balanced" treaties with 13 out of
14 neighbors in keeping with international legal principles (Kraska,
2015). These instances have not, however, drawn any significant media
attention. Instead, [the emphasis on China's non-compliance with
international law in the South China Sea disputes has served to
recapitulate China in Orientalist terms as uncivilized and, moreover, as
a fully awakened "sleeping giant" that bullies its
neighbors]{.underline} and is unsuited to replace the US as regional
leader. [US political rhetoric and media representation has also
obscured the vagueness of international law when applied to the East
China Sea dispute as it would be inconsistent with the image of China as
a lawless bully in the South China Sea]{.underline}. The UNCLOS appears
to have a straightforward framework that gives states maritime
jurisdiction over resources 200 nautical miles from their coastal
baseline, but it says nothing about how overlapping maritime
jurisdictions are to be resolved. In the case of the East China Sea, the
area of dispute is only 360 miles across at its widest point. [At the
heart of the territorial dispute between China and Japan is the
"territorial acquisition" of the Senkaku/Diaoyutai islands, but there is
no convention on how states acquire sovereignty over disputed
territories]{.underline}.4 The flexibility of applicable principles in
international customary law have instead allowed both China and Japan to
invoke the law to justify their claims to sovereignty (Ramos-Mrosovsky,
2008). China's refusal to have the dispute adjudicated by an
international body reflects the unpredictability of outcomes and not
necessarily China's lawlessness, especially when viewed, in light of a
similar disinterest on the part of the Japanese. **[The essentialization
of China as lawless, despite the malleability of international law and
dissimilar behavior in other disputes, has the potential to drive a
wedge between China and her neighbors, thus "containing" China's growing
influence in the region]{.underline}**. Indeed, [the depiction of China
as a lawless bully plays up the insecurities of its
immediate]{.underline}---and in many cases, much weaker--- [neighbors,
whose heavy reliance on international law to constrain hegemonic
behavior is palpable.]{.underline} The breaking of norms has been
identified as a crucial signal that heightens threat perception
(Farnham, 2003). In the context of long-standing maritime territorial
disputes, **[playing up an image of China as a lawless bully also
suggests that the United States continues to be a necessary power broker
in the region.]{.underline}** The notion [that]{.underline} there is an
overbearing bully in the neighborhood that could care less about the
rules of the game [returns the United States to the role of protector in
the post-- Cold War period---its ostensible "manifest
destiny."]{.underline} Since the late 1990s, titles such as "Spratly
Spat Heats up over Chinese 'Bullying'" (Lamb, 1998) or "Asian Nations
Support US Silently" (Wiseman, 2001) demonstrate how constructing China
as a lawless bully serves to reinforce this purpose. Indeed, a recent
editorial in The Wall Street Journal makes this link explicit in the
text: Washington's hesitant response has allowed controversy to build
around freedom-of-navigation missions that should be routine. Beijing's
strategy in the South China Sea is to bully its neighbors and achieve
regional hegemony through coercive means short of war. Turning peaceful
naval patrols into diplomatic hot potatoes is exactly the sort of change
Beijing seeks. ("A 12-Mile," 2015) Here, China's behavior is portrayed
as incorrigibly belligerent, in distinct contrast to genteel US
diplomacy. One Wall Street Journal article makes this point clear in its
title alone: "Chinese Diplomacy Off Course; By Overreaching in the South
China Sea, Beijing has Drawn the US Irrevocably into the Debate" (Wain,
2000). This article embodies **[the dominant narrative]{.underline}**
that **[assumes implicitly the rightful role of the United States to
dole out proper diplomacy and take on any transgressors to maintain
world peace.]{.underline}** A Wall Street Journal article describing
China's "increasingly powerful---but highly opaque---military and its
more assertive stance \[towards the South China Sea\]" emphasize China's
military as an inherent threat to world order but construct the US
military according to a different standard, again assuming the
righteousness of US military intervention (Page, 2011). In this regard,
it is important to note that US grand strategy consists of preventing
the development of any regional power capable of obstructing US access
to Eurasia---where most of the world's resources and economic activity
are located. This long-term security goal has informed the Obama
administration's much-touted Pacific Pivot policy, which many have
viewed as a "China containment policy." A Congressional Report notes
that although U.S. policymakers have not often stated this key national
strategic goal explicitly in public, U.S. military (and diplomatic)
operations in recent decades---both wartime operations and day-to-day
operations---can be viewed as having been carried out in no small part
in support of this key goal. (O'Rourke, 2014) China's territorial claims
in the South China Sea cover about 90% of the area that could
potentially allow China to deny the United States such access. As China
continues with the modernization of its naval and air capabilities, US
apprehension has increased that the disputed land features in the South
China Sea are being used to bolster military and coast guard forces that
can monitor and respond to the activities of US allies, deny the US navy
access to these waters, and ultimately check US naval dominance in the
region. It is for this reason that the **[United States has insisted on
freedom of navigation and innocent passage---protected by
UNCLOS---through these contested waters, although tensions with China
have ratcheted up considerably as a result.]{.underline}** [As direct
conflict between the United States and China has become a real
possibility]{.underline}, and as the United States has not ratified the
UNCLOS, the [United States has attempted to base its actions on firm
legal principles, and in turn, to frame China's behavior in the region
as lawlessness.]{.underline} Through US portrayals of China as a lawless
bully, [China incurs reputational costs in the global and regional
community that have the potential to exert pressure on China to stand
down.]{.underline} The guided-missile destroyer USS Lassen was thus sent
in October 2015 on a "freedom of navigation" patrol within 12 nautical
miles of islands artificially built by China in the Spratly chain, which
the United States insists is in compliance with international law.5 The
United States revealed this aim in another dispute on whether China has
an international legal right to regulate foreign military actors
operating within China's 200-nautical-mile EEZ. The United States' view,
which China disagrees with, is that China has a right to restrict
military and surveillance activities only within 12 nautical miles of
its territorial waters. Tensions reached new heights when China
announced in November 2013 an East China Sea Air Defense Identification
Zone (ADIZ) that not only covered her territorial waters but extended
into its EEZ and thus, the contested areas in the East China Sea. US
Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel responded in a press statement that "We
view this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo
in the region. [This unilateral action increases the risk of
misunderstanding and miscalculations," yet the United States followed
shortly by flying two B-52 bombers through the zone]{.underline}
(Harlan, 2013).

### Link---Ukraine Reps---1NC

#### The Aff's moralizing over Ukraine does nothing and costs them nothing --their moral blackmail to take sides for NATO is depoliticizing and eliminates space for critical interrogation.

**Chandler 22** \[David, Professor of International Relations at the
University of Westminster, "Opinion -- Political Positionality and the
War in the Ukraine," *E-International Relations*, 03/25/22,
<https://www.e-ir.info/2022/03/25/opinion-political-positionality-and-the-war-in-the-ukraine/>,
accessed 07/22/22, GDI-JCR\]

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine seems to have caught the political
zeitgeist as a moral cause capable of reinvigorating failing political
leaders]{.underline}, parties, and ideologies whether radical or
conservative. Demonstrating support for the Ukraine appears to be
practically mandatory in workplaces and public spaces the same way as
wearing masks and socially distancing was during the earlier days of the
pandemic. In the face of the moralising, widespread across the political
spectrum, possibilities arise for critical approaches which start from a
different political positionality. Support for Ukraine appears to have
helped political actors, international institutions and civil society
groupings in their search for legitimacy and moral purpose. However,
[there is a certain hollowness to this 'support']{.underline} which is
more a matter of declaration than any willingness to go to war for the
sake of the Ukraine let alone ease the path of EU accession. [Supporting
Ukraine involves little personal cost or commitment. People feel morally
good about supporting Ukraine]{.underline} in a way that they would not
about declaring any support for political parties or individuals. In a
world where people appear to be alienated from political parties and
formal political projects, politics can easily become a matter of moral
or ethical declaration rather than political engagement in building
constituencies and relations. For this reason, political issues can
easily become moralised; taken out of strategic relations and presented
as existential questions. Carl Schmitt makes this point in Theory of the
Partisan, in distinguishing telluric and non-telluric struggles.
Non-telluric struggles, no longer grounded in a specific context, tend
towards existentialist extremes, lacking a concrete audience and goals.
Western responses to the war highlight how [moralisation has displaced
practices of politicisation. The goal of politicisation is to clarify
political stakes in the process of building a social and political
movement of transformation. Moralisation]{.underline} is a poor
substitute for this approach to community building as it [abstracts
individual political questions and issues from the contexts from which
they derive.]{.underline} More importantly, moralisation leads to
solipsism where what were previously political questions become
statements of personal or group identity. [In the absence of political
and organisational alternatives, reducing politics to demonstrating
moral virtue leaves only limited room for political manoeuvre. The fact
that doing 'politics' means expressing a 'position' has meant that those
on the left have been forced into choosing between the rearmament of
NATO powers and defending Putin's regime, choosing between bad
imperialists and even worse imperialists.]{.underline} For some this
limit has been spun into a positive, for example with Spiked magazine
giving full backing to NATO, bemoaning the 'moral defeatism of the West'
and wondering 'Is nothing worth a war?' Our current context challenges
the traditional understanding of political positionality. In the past a
critical political response to international conflict may well have been
oriented to the 'enemy at home', flagging up the double standards of
Western moral and militarist claims (the 'whataboutism' discussed by
Lorenzo Kamel). The political positionality of being a Western observer
rather than a participant would have potentially restrained militarist
demands to intervene because these calls for war could only empower
ruling elites and institutions with extensive problematic records of
their own. Today, the framework which enabled this form of political
positionality appears to have dissipated. This change is reflected in
the fact that the moral consensus over the Ukraine is very different to
the moralised political discourse of previous international conflict
situations, where there was also the mobilisation of moral outrage, for
example, the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq. The level of consensus is
particularly striking considering that Western powers are (as yet) not
directly involved. In fact, it is not so much even a political question
of taking sides, more one of whether and how to demonstrate support.
Today[, in the face of the moral displacement of politics it seems that
a new understanding of political positionality may be
necessary.]{.underline} One that recognises that traditional political
frameworks no longer shape responses to events in the international
sphere. From an anti- or ante- political positionality it seems clear
that [we should refuse the moral blackmail of taking sides and choosing
a political position. It would be nice to pretend that we still lived in
a modernist world of meaningful political choices, where 'taking sides'
was part of a broader grand narrative of struggle and progress. However,
we do not live in a world of left and right but in its moralised
afterlife]{.underline}. From a political positionality that recognises
this shift, [we should refuse the lure of the political and the moral
pressure to declare our support for Ukraine. We should refuse the demand
to moralise war and conflict. We should de-moralise the afterlife of
politics and the world that enables it.]{.underline} Rather than
exaggerating and bemoaning the 'moral defeatism' of the West we should
rather be pushing it further. Is nothing worth a war? Perhaps as Aimé
Césaire and Frantz Fanon recognised, the only war worth starting is one
to end the world (and its political afterlife) rather than to salvage
it.

#### The moralizing frame around support for Ukraine is rooted in racialized and militaristic constructions of international civil society. These moral binaries prompt further violence and crush critical dissent.

With the ongoing war in the Ukraine, international politicians and
campaign organisations are continually inviting us to express support
for the solidarity actions of international civil society.
[International civil society is increasingly seen to be key in
pressurising the Russian regime and mobilizing public
opinion]{.underline} behind the defence of the Ukraine. Who wouldn't
want to be part of international civil society? Who wouldn't want to
take the opportunity to show that they belong to international civil
society, even to show that they take their membership responsibilities
seriously? [Against this growing moral consensus, it is important to
flag up the unpleasant paradox at the heart of international civil
society.]{.underline} The paradox is that [international civil society
is]{.underline} in essence [neither particularly international nor
inclusive, nor particularly civil and peace-loving, but rather works
upon divisive moral binaries which can easily become highly racializing
and dangerously militaristic.]{.underline} Firstly, ['international
civil society' is not very international. Whilst the rhetoric of
solidarity with the Ukraine is couched in universalizing
terms]{.underline} of 'global', 'world-wide' or 'international' moral
outrage, [the states of the Global South have been notably absent from
moral grandstanding.]{.underline} This has led some commentators to
suggest the possibility of a new non-aligned movement, which rejects the
Western demands of war and rearmament for 'peace'. However, the problem
of 'international civil society' rhetoric is not merely that it is
exclusive and selective on a factual level. It is deeply divisive
because '[international civil society' can only come into existence on
the basis of a moral binary which provides its ethical identity. If
there is no construction of an existential threat there is no
international civil society.]{.underline} Thus, the demand for
solidarity with 'international civil society' is necessarily morally
divisive. It is necessarily against someone or something morally to be
excluded, as not just 'uncivil' but an entity that in its 'uncivility'
is a threat or an offense to 'international civil society'. [The
performance or construction of 'international civil society' thereby is
indistinguishable from demands for denouncing/ sanctioning/ cancelling/
withdrawing from/ banning/ whoever is constructed as a threat to or
'outside' international civil society.]{.underline} Because
'international civil society' is constructed as a moral or ethical
identity, [the binary division easily becomes a totalizing one. There
can be no grey areas, no room for ambiguity.]{.underline} Paradoxically
this not only makes 'international civil society' lacking in its very
internationalism, in terms of its need for division and exclusion, it is
also not very civil. There is very little protection afforded those on
the wrong side of the moral divide, while those with the moral high
ground have little to constrain them. To illustrate the second paradox,
the lack of civility, a good example of what happens when you end up on
the wrong side of 'international civil society' has been the media and
institutional treatment of the Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak who attached
a 'Z' symbol to his leotard, at a recent World Cup event, showing
support for the Russian forces. He is alleged to have 'provoked global
anger'; the International Gymnastics Federation immediately condemned
his "shocking behaviour" and he now faces the prospect of losing his
medal and a lengthy ban from the sport. Of course, international civil
society is not all about bans and restrictions on free speech. Hate
speech restrictions are being lifted to allow Facebook and Instagram
users in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus to call for the deaths of
Russians and Russian soldiers. The parent company of Facebook and
Instagram, Meta, is also to allow praise of the Ukrainian far-right Azov
battalion, which is normally prohibited. A spokesperson stating the
company was "for the time being, making a narrow exception for praise of
the Azov regiment strictly in the context of defending Ukraine, or in
their role as part of the Ukraine National Guard". Of course, we have
been here before, when 'international civil society' was regularly
relied upon to legitimise taking sides in another conflict on Europe's
margins, during the late 90's and the wars of Yugoslavia's
disintegration. Here, too, there was international moral outrage,
embedded media reporting bringing the horrors of war into every living
room and the illegal bombing of European capital cities. Perhaps the
lesson to be learned is that US and European-led 'international civil
society' easily went from moral outrage calling for humanitarian aid for
besieged European capital Sarajevo to support for the 'illegal but
legitimate' bombing of European capital Belgrade. [We should say no to
international civil society because totalizing moral binaries are
particularly dangerous in the sphere of international
relations]{.underline}, where international law lacks universal
mechanisms of enforcement. Readers might think it's unproblematic to
implement selective rules for political symbolism in sports or for hate
speech on social media depending on what side of the moral divide of
'international civil society' individuals are on. However, [it is clear
that moralizing the international order]{.underline}, in the 'paradigm
shift' called for by UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, [can only further
cohere existing international inequalities and postcolonial
hierarchies.]{.underline}

#### Only a critical historical methodology can liberate knowledge from the epistemological hegemony underlying NATO conceptions of security. The Aff's call to action is a totalitarian orientation toward time that masks unconscious Eurocentric interests and assumptions.

Carreira, \"NATO: upholding Civilisation, protecting Individuals. The
unconscious dimension of international security,\" University of
Coimbra, September 2016, google scholar, accessed 7/6/2022, gdi-tmur)

The suggestion of [embracing time more critically has to do with
adopting a view that is no longer focused on the immediacy of change, on
recent institutional developments, but that rather espouses longer
processes of change more focused on meaning and perception formation and
their diffusion in time.]{.underline} This is a way of accompanying the
evolution of ideas, and understanding how the temporal distance of
original contexts may be eroded and dispersed through hegemonic
knowledge, thus turning into an unconscious, accepted and naturalised
knowledge. In order to justify such an approach, this dissertation will
proceed by exposing the intellectual zeitgeist and the core theoretical
corpus that support my view. After that, it will be possible to
elaborate on the key argument of this research, that is, [NATO's
particular endorsement of]{.underline} the Individualisation of
[Security has acted as a transformative process of post-Cold War
international security, through which Western civilisation is actually
upheld and continued]{.underline} in the field of international
security. In accordance with the epistemological concerns and challenges
exposed so far, and drawing on the suggestion of embracing time more
critically in order to uncover the processes of knowledge establishment,
this study is largely set within Critical Theory and other "alternative
approaches", to quote Richard Wyn Jones (2001: 3), like
poststructuralism and postmodernism. [Questioning the prevailing
forms]{.underline} we have [of perceiving and knowing both the concept
of civilisation and]{.underline} the emergence of certain normative
patterns such as the Individualisation of Security in [international
security]{.underline}, remits to one fundamental concern of Critical
Theory, that is, the relationship between knowledge and values and, more
broadly, between knowledge and society (Devetak, 1995). Put as such,
this dissertation embraces Critical Theory as more than a conceptual
toolkit; not only [is]{.underline} it a philosophical and methodological
positioning, as [an essential social commitment towards the liberation
of knowledge]{.underline} as well. Originally, Critical Theory is
derived from various strands of Western social, political and
philosophical thought. The reference to the "Frankfurt School" is used
interchangeably with "Critical theory" usually to refer to a group of
thinkers from the Institut für Sozialforschung (Institute of Social
Research) first established in Frankfurt in 1923, including Theodor
Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse, and others more "loosely
affiliated thinkers" like Walter Benjamin and Eric Fromm (Peoples, 2009:
8). The Frankfurt School is inspired by the thinking of Immanuel Kant,
Georg Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Sigmund
Freud, in a synthesis of various traditions of modern theory, including
German Idealism, Historical Materialism, Modernism and Psychoanalysis
(Roach, 2008). Given the diversity of the intellectual background of
those thinkers -- philosophy, sociology, musicology, and psychoanalysis
-- this school has a "self-consciously inter-disciplinary nature" that
provides its analysis of social change with a deeper understanding of
society (Peoples, 2009: 8-9). Yet, it can be said that the common thread
unifying them is basically a Marxian tradition of [producing "an
analysis of society that aims \[...\] to support a process of
emancipatory social transformation"]{.underline} (Wyn Jones, 2001: 6).
In very significant ways, the emergence of Critical Theory actually
[challenges the dominating social model in the West]{.underline} in the
aftermath of WWI, which is quite revealing of an overall Western crisis
at the time -- social, ideological, intellectual, political. The first
enunciation of "Critical Theory" as such appeared in 1937 in an essay of
Max Horkheimer, to describe his own research programme under the
auspices of the Frankfurt School. In his critique of what he termed
"Traditional Theory", Horkheimer denounced scientific positivism and
those forms of social science that tried to imitate the objectivity of
the natural sciences. Thinking the theorist could somehow be detached
from the social world was an illusion, so he deemed. In opposition to
that, Horkheimer defined his theory as self-critical, in that it
acknowledged its own function within society (Horkheimer, 2002;
Müller-Doohm, 2006: 171). This is clearly inspired by Georg Friedrich
Hegel's (1977), who was the first concerned with bringing into
visibility the internal contradictions, tensions, distortions -- in
Hegel's term the "negative" -- of the categories of mind constitutive of
knowledge. Also, according to Adorno and Horkheimer (1997), [scientific
rationality evolves according to a latently totalitarian logic of
domination]{.underline}, so it is [bound up with ideological systems,
which ultimately is an attempt at domesticating]{.underline} nature and
enslaving [humanity.]{.underline} This is central to conceive the
potential for contribution of Critical Theory in this dissertation
regarding the problems raised since the beginning of this introduction.
In particular, it highlights how [hegemonic knowledge shapes the
perceptions and representations of the world in a way that makes certain
ideas persist in detriment of others]{.underline}, which makes human
mind to stagnate, [and prevents it from progressing towards new
meanings, and from achieving genuine social change.]{.underline} Indeed,
critical thinkers are particularly aware of the non-exempt relationship
existing between knowledge and society, and invariably probed forms of
hegemonic knowledge. That is why Critical Theory generally stands for
the non-acceptance of the prevailing order, on the basis that the order
we know is "\[b\]y no means natural, necessary or historically
invariable" (Devetak, 2005a: 143). This awareness further implies that
critical thinking also "\[r\]eflects the process of learning to do
theory in the sense of becoming aware of one's changing ties to
(identity with) society" (Roach, 2008: xvi). The complex relationship
between knowledge claims, politics and power is specifically approached
by postmodernism, whose definition is fairly disputed. Many authors
considered as such do not even use the term -- like Michel Foucault, for
example -- and sometimes prefer "post-structuralism" or "deconstruction"
(Devetak, 2005b: 161). In the field of social philosophy, postmodernism
expresses an "ex-Leftist exhaustion and disillusion", having as a key
figure the French philosopher Jean-François Lyotard, a disillusioned
former militant of the far-left grouplet Socialisme ou Barbarie
(Therborn, 2006: 186). It is interesting to note that both this
reference to the opposition between socialism and barbarism, and
Horkheimer's concern with the abandonment of all culture and barbarism
(Müller-Doohm, 2006: 172) basically posit the idea of civilisation as
the value centrally at stake within Critical Theory, for they enounce
barbarism as the negative side of Traditional Theory. In The Postmodern
condition: a report on knowledge (1984), Lyotard focused on the status
of science and technology, technocracy and the control of knowledge and
information. In it, he highlighted the ethical dimension underlying the
legitimation of knowledge, which should not be about denotative
utterances, but rather about normative prescriptions: \[t\]he only role
positive knowledge can play is to inform the practical subject about the
reality within which the execution of the prescription is to be
inscribed. \[...\] It is one thing for an undertaking to be possible and
another for it to be just. Knowledge is no longer the subject, but in
the service of the subject: its only legitimacy (though it is
formidable) is the fact that it allows morality to become reality
(Lyotard, 1984: 36). Postmodernism has strived to denaturalise the
epistemological dispositions inherent to the Modern paradigms of
political, economic and social organisation, including the prevailing
identity formations that appear as normal, as social conventions or
dogmas (Devetak, 2005b: 166). Indeed, as its name indicates, the
postmodern school of thought essentially confronts the grand narratives
of Modernity. The "project" of Modernity, as Jürgen Habermas (1983)
calls it, emerged during the eighteenth century. It was an intellectual
and secular effort undertaken by Enlightenment thinkers to develop human
rationality, through objective science, universal morality and law, with
the ultimate goal of liberating individuals from the irrationalities of
religion, myths, superstition, and from the arbitrary use of power
(Harvey, 1996: 12-13). As a concept, Modernity was first developed by
Hegel, who used it in historical contexts to describe a precise epoch.
Around 1800, the reference to the "modern times" -- in English, and
temps modernes in French -- depicted the three centuries just preceding
(Habermas, 1998: 5). Postmodernism was never intended to be a social
theory as such; it began as a movement within architecture and the arts,
primarily literature, expressing a revolt against the rigid formalism of
modernism, without being a rejection of, or a movement against,
Modernity per se (Delanty, 2006b: 270-271). The postmodern critique
towards Modernity often discloses its problematic relationship with
time. Modernity essentially embraced the idea of progress in a way that
obliterates the past, the old, the traditional, only to look into a
reachable future where modern man, society, civilisation have only one
direction, that is, forward (Therborn, 2006: 187). In the artistic
field, for instance, a modern artist was considered to be someone with
the capacity to extract the fleeting qualities of society and
individuals, and freeze them in time to make them universal and eternal
(Harvey, 1996: 20- 21). Postmodernists perceive far more nuance and
shadow, and see history as "\[a\] series of dominations replacing other
dominations, and the knowledgeable subject as the site for the interplay
between these dominations rather than the vehicle for their
transcendence" (Smith, 1997: 334). Postmodernism enhances the influence
of temporality upon the fixation of meanings within society, because
Modernity as a socio-historical construct erects seemingly timeless
meanings, thus creating illusions of knowledge. This is precisely
related to [the epistemological illusions]{.underline} Hobson (2002)
identifies [in IR]{.underline}, as exposed above. Modernity thereby
[implies a form of exclusionary knowledge that leaves many social
meanings and alternatives aside.]{.underline} In fact, at the time of
Enlightenment, history was viewed as a uniform process that generates
problems. [Time became experienced as a pressure over the need to master
the problems that arose]{.underline}, and the new modern world would be
privileged over the old by the fact that "\[i\]t opens itself to the
future, the epochal new beginning is rendered constant with each moment
that gives birth to the new" (Habermas, 1998: 6). Therefore, Modernity
narrates the past as a time reigned by ignorance, superstition,
oppression, poverty, disease, stagnation, imitation, and depicts the
project of an emancipating future, one that liberates from the misery of
the past towards a rational, individualised, ever-growing, developed,
creative and progressive society (Therborn, 2006: 187). In such a
context, where the past is constantly revised, and the present redeemed
by the potentialities of the future, [time becomes naturalised in a
predictable order of events and expectations, and the new problems
arising are silenced by this pressure of time.]{.underline} The meaning
of time is rarely debated, as we tend to take it for granted in our
common-sense attributions, around which we organise our daily routines
(Harvey, 1996: 201). The critique of the treatment of time is a topic
that Walter Benjamin persistently engaged with, namely through his
critique of historicism, which he considered a way to tell history as a
"sequence of events like the beads of a rosary" (Benjamin, 1973: 263).
Benjamin rejected this Modern conception of time as linear progress, and
urged for rethinking the idea that the future is the natural
continuation of present and past. The past, according to Benjamin, can
only be seized in an image occurring at a specific moment that is not to
be repeatable. As a consequence, the present is only a transition, an
interruptive force that seizes an image of the past. The past, which
Benjamin calls "tradition", is always in danger of being appropriated
for political purposes. That is why Benjamin saw documents of culture as
documents of barbarism, in that the victors endowed with the legitimacy
to write history determine what the past means (Benjamin, 1973: 257;
Ferris, 2008: 132-133). In turn, the future was seen to offer something
other than the extension of the same forms of social and political life
(Stephens, 2009: 79). Benjamin thus rejoined Critical Theory by
providing the future with a transformative potential, that is, with
emancipation from temporality. Benjamin allows transitioning to
post-structuralism's contribution. Like postmodernism,
post-structuralism is not anti-modern, nor against the project of
Modernity or Enlightenment. Rather, it refuses to accept it as a
pre-packaged set of ideas that can be applied linearly like a tradition,
and does not take it as "temporal or spatial field of uniform content"
with definite boundaries (Ashley, 1989: 260). Accordingly, the project
of Modernity must develop a critical historical account of how we came
to be what we are, a reflection of the self-formative processes
(Devetak, 1995). Post-structuralism offers a more specific contribution
in its formulation against the totalisation of knowledge and in the
search for its deconstruction, by proposing methodological tools that
address the epistemological challenges identified so far. Richard
Ashley's piece "Living on border lines: Man, Poststructuralism, and war"
(1989) is central in conceiving the epistemological challenges inherent
to Western culture. Ashley (1989: 261) exposes the influence of
Logocentrism as the hegemonic system of expressions of duality, such as
core/periphery, continuity/change, literal/figural, nature/culture,
individual/collective, domestic/international, etc. He further explains
that this logocentric tradition under Modernity tends to impose
hierarchy, whereby one side of interpretation becomes sovereign for the
participant, while the other is defined solely in relation to the
former. Logocentric discourse thereby privileges one term only of the
opposition (ibid.). While the privileged term is held as the source of
truth and as a priority, the second is conceived as a deviation,
complication, deterioration, accident (Ashley, 1989: 262). Ashley
resorts to literary theory to claim that a "narrative structure is
imposed upon history" (Ashley, 1989: 282), implying that \[a\] narrative
reasserts closure by imposing a central ordering principle whose
categories and standards of interpretation are taken to express the
essential and timeless truth integrating all of the historical times and
places among which it discriminates. It constructs a story in which all
time, all space, all difference, and all discontinuity are cast as part
of a universal project in which the ordering principle is itself
redeemed as necessarily, timelessly, and universally true (Ashley, 1989:
264). This seemingly goes in Lyotard's sense (1984), who deemed there is
a resurgence of narrative knowledge in the West as a way of solving the
problem of legitimating the new authorities. From this, one may assume
that the conceptual and theoretical limitations of IR in dealing with
the West, which were identified above, are clearly the focus of many
strands of Critical Theory. The exclusionary essence of Western mental
structures and sense of time appears to have impacted upon the very
creation of scientific knowledge itself. In this sense, IR would be the
victim of Modernity too, hence the challenge of scientific emancipation.
That is why Michel Foucault (1995: 31) attempted to "write the history
of the present". His intent was to ask how we have made the present seem
like a normal or natural condition, and what has been forgotten or
remembered in order to legitimise the present and its courses of action.
Put in other terms, he focuses on how societies arrive at particular
practices of inclusion and exclusion that not only allow forgetting or
remembering, as they also differentiate the Self from Otherness. Hence
the importance of a deeper reflection on the underlying spatial and
temporal context of actors, ideas and concepts that might allow
understanding how they have become an unconscious issue. Throughout his
work, Michel Foucault's philosophical approach sought to deconstruct and
denaturalise central concepts and visions of history that shape our
knowledge of the world. In order to do that, Foucault questioned how a
certain issue becomes a problem historically, i.e., how it was
problematised in history (Neal, 2009: 167). One central method he
advocates is the archaeological analysis, which insists on the
historicisation of discourses, techniques, and practices in respect of
their specific spatial and temporal circumstances (ibid.). To Foucault
(2003: 269), the predominant historicalpolitical discourse that
Modernity deals with is a discourse that inverts the traditional values
of intelligibility, and explains things in confuse, obscure, and
disorganised ways. The interpretive tools used within this tradition
have to do with the confusion and physical force of violence, passion,
hate, revenge, and a series of circumstances that are articulated in
terms of defeats and victories, confrontations among alliances, and
rebellions (ibid.). On the contrary, Foucault views history as a set of
declarations, documents, institutions, and notions that cumulate and
interact. Therefore, he rejects that all might be reduced to one grand
narrative supporting the states' and the West's sovereign presence as
being at the centre of world history (Neal, 2009: 165). As such, the
archaeological method privileges decentralisation, and the
historicisation of institutions together with their respective power
relations: Basically, I had been doing nothing except trying to retrace
how a certain number of institutions, beginning to function on behalf of
reason and normality, had brought their power to bear on groups of
individuals, in terms of behaviors, ways of being, acting, or speaking
that were constituted as abnormality, madness, illness, and so on. I had
done nothing else, really, but a history of power (Foucault, 2000: 283).
Power relations are essential, for they surface around a given problem
to include the web of individuals that constituted it as a problem,
acted to solve it, used particular forms of language, and made concepts
to emerge, as well as techniques, methods, and knowledge in order to
answer that problem (Neal, 2009: 167). This is in part a "genealogical"
exercise, in the sense that [we need to focus on "a form of history that
can account for the constitution of knowledges, discourses, domains of
objects"]{.underline} (Foucault, 2000: 118). Genealogies are therefore
not positivistic returns to a form of science that is more attentive or
more accurate. Genealogies are, quite specifically, antisciences.
\[...\] They are about the insurrection of knowledges. Not so much
against the contents, methods, or concepts of a science; this is above
all, primarily, an insurrection against the centralizing power-effects
that are bound up with the institutionalization and workings of any
scientific discourse organized in a society such as ours (Foucault,
2003: 9). As this theoretical section has insisted so far, [Critical
Theory provides different perspectives that]{.underline} all concur to
[give visibility and deconstruct the]{.underline} enslaving domino
effect of interrelated aspects of Western Modernity, namely, a [rigid
conception of temporality that encloses meanings within a stagnated
knowledge, and ultimately naturalises unquestioned behaviour and
identity, thereby excluding a whole world of epistemological and social
possibilities.]{.underline} In this context, Foucault provides very
pertinent tools to inquire on NATO's civilisational identity and
post-Cold War normative evolution around the Individualisation of
Security and simultaneously rejoin the aforementioned precepts of
Critical Theory. First, one may conceive the possibility that [a modern
narrative on Western civilisation, confined within a static linearity of
time and progress, has influenced the conscious knowledge we have of
NATO as the product of a normal evolution of a pre-existing
civilisational identity.]{.underline} In the sense of what Foucault
advises, [the spatial and temporal context of NATO's emergence should be
questioned in relation to how the past was appropriated, and through
what kind of practices of domination and relations of
power.]{.underline} Moreover, one may also assess to what extent NATO
may benefit from the West's cumulated capital of domination in order to
influence and control the field of international security. Therefore,
NATO may draw on the West as a civilisational entity to adopt new norms
without jeopardizing the representations we have of NATO, that is,
questioning what it essentially does, how and why. However, [by
uncovering what those practices of domination and power relations
consist of, and how they have produced hegemonic knowledge, an essential
unconscious dimension remains]{.underline} in the realm of what has been
subjugated, i.e., of what has been dominated in order to naturalise the
hegemonic content of knowledge. This phenomenon is in part illustrated
by André Barrinha and Marcos Rosa (2013: 110), who show that [security
meanings in the context of NATO or the EU are appropriated by their
members in such a way that they end up "translating a particular liberal
understanding of securit]{.underline}y that is in many cases completely
foreign" to their own security context. Put in other words, [the
naturalisation of knowledge implies that unconscious meanings have to be
conveyed and seized through the narratives on Western
civilisation.]{.underline}

#### A genealogy capable of challenging contemporary security structures must refuse the pull of easy "alternatives" -- this is key to new understandings and possibilities

Nietzsche, and Baudrillard," ed. Ronnie Lipschutz, *On Security*,

[We have inherited an ontotheology of security, that is, an a priori
argument that proves the existence and necessity of only one form of
security because there currently happens to be a widespread,
metaphysical belief in it.]{.underline} Indeed, [within the concept of
security lurks the entire history of western metaphysics]{.underline},
which was best described by Derrida \"as a series of substitutions of
center for center\" in a perpetual search for the \"transcendental
signified.\"1 From God to Rational Man, from Empire to Republic, from
King to the People\--and on occasion in the reverse direction as well,
for history is never so linear, never so neat as we would write it\--the
security of the center has been the shifting site from which the forces
of authority, order, and identity philosophically defined and physically
kept at bay anarchy, chaos, and difference. Yet the center, as modern
poets and postmodern critics tell us, no longer holds. The demise of a
bipolar system, the diffusion of power into new political, national, and
economic constellations, the decline of civil society and the rise of
the shopping mall, the acceleration of everything \--transportation,
capital and information flows, change itself\--have induced a new
anxiety. As George Bush repeatedly said\--that is, until the 1992
Presidential election went into full swing\--\"The enemy is
unpredictability. The enemy is instability.\"2 One immediate response,
[the unthinking reaction, is to master this anxiety and to resecure the
center by remapping the peripheral threats.]{.underline} In this vein,
the Pentagon prepares seven military scenarios for future conflict,
ranging from latino small-fry to an IdentiKit super-enemy that goes by
the generic acronym of REGT (\"Reemergent Global Threat\"). In the
heartlands of America, Toyota sledge-hammering returns as a popular
know-nothing distraction. And within the Washington beltway, rogue
powers such as North Korea, Iraq, and Libya take on the status of
pariah-state and potential video bomb-site for a permanently
electioneering elite. [There are also prodromal efforts to shore up the
center of the International Relations discipline.]{.underline} In a
newly instituted series in the International Studies Quarterly , the
state of [security studies is surveyed so as to refortify its
borders.]{.underline}3 After acknowledging that \"the boundaries of
intellectual disciplines are permeable,\" the author proceeds not only
to raise the drawbridge but also to caulk every chink in the moat.4
Recent attempts to broaden the concept of \"security\" to include such
issues as global environmental dangers, disease, and economic and
natural disasters endanger the field by threatening \"to destroy its
intellectual coherence and make it more difficult to devise solutions to
any of these important problems.\"5 The field is surveyed in the most
narrow and parochial way: out of 200-plus works cited, esteemed Third
World scholars of strategic studies receive no mention, British and
French scholars receive short shrift, and Soviet writers do not make it
into the Pantheon at all. The author of the essay, Stephen Walt, has
written one of the better books on alliance systems;6 here he seems
intent on constructing a new alliance within the discipline against
\"foreign\" others, with the \"postmodernist\" as arch-alien. The tactic
is familiar: like many of the neoconservatives who have launched the
recent attacks on \"political correctness,\" the \"liberals\" of
international relations make it a habit to base their criticisms on
secondary accounts of a category of thinking rather than on a primary
engagement with the specific (and often differing) views of the thinkers
themselves.7 In this case, Walt cites IR scholar Robert Keohane on the
hazards of \"reflectivism,\" to warn off anyone who by inclination or
error might wander into the foreign camp: \"As Robert Keohane has noted,
until these writers \`have delineated . . . a research program and shown
. . . that it can illuminate important issues in world politics, they
will remain on the margins of the field.\' \"8 By the end of the essay,
one is left with the suspicion that the rapid changes in world politics
have triggered a \"security crisis\" in security studies that requires
extensive theoretical damage control. What [if we leave the desire for
mastery to the insecure and instead imagine a new dialogue of
security]{.underline}, not in the pursuit of a utopian end but in
recognition of the world as it is, other than us ? What might such a
dialogue sound like? [Any attempt at an answer requires a genealogy: to
understand the discursive power of the concept, to remember its
forgotten meanings, to assess its economy of use in the present, to
reinterpret]{.underline}\--and possibly construct through the
reinterpretation\--[a late modern security]{.underline} comfortable with
a plurality of centers, multiple meanings, and fluid identities. The
steps I take here in this direction are tentative and preliminary. I
first undertake a brief history of the concept itself. Second, I present
the \"originary\" form of security that has so dominated our conception
of international relations, the Hobbesian episteme of realism. Third, I
consider the impact of two major challenges to the Hobbesian episteme,
that of Marx and Nietzsche. And finally, I suggest that Baudrillard
provides the best, if most nullifying, analysis of security in late
modernity. In short, [I retell the story of realism as an historic
encounter of fear and danger with power and order that
produced]{.underline} four realist [forms of security: epistemic,
social, interpretive, and hyperreal.]{.underline} To preempt a
predictable criticism, I wish to make it clear that I am not in search
of an \"alternative security.\" An easy defense is to invoke Heidegger,
who declared that \"questioning is the piety of thought.\"9 Foucault,
however, gives the more powerful reason for [a genealogy of
security]{.underline}: I am [not looking for an alternative; you can\'t
find the solution of a problem in the solution of another problem raised
at another moment by other people.]{.underline} You see, what I want to
do is not the history of solutions, and that\'s the reason why [I don\'t
accept the word alternative]{.underline} . My point is not that
everything is bad, but that everything is dangerous, then we always have
something to do.10 [The hope is that in the interpretation of the most
pressing dangers of late modernity we might be able to
construct]{.underline} a form of security based on the appreciation and
articulation rather than the normalization or extirpation of difference.
In traditional realist representations of world politics as the struggle
for power among states, the will to security is born out of a primal
fear, a natural estrangement and a condition of anarchy which diplomacy,
international law and the balance of power seek, yet ultimately fail, to
mediate.11 By considering some historical meanings of security that
exceed this prevailing view, I wish to suggest [\"new\" possibilities
and intelligibilities]{.underline} for security. Admittedly, this brief
genealogy is thin on analysis and thick on description. But my intention
is to provoke discussion, and to suggest that there is more than a
speculative basis for the acceptance of a concept of security that is
less coherent and dogmatic, and more [open to the historical complexity
and contingent nature of international relations.]{.underline}

### 2NC Alt---Discourse Key

#### Securitization is enacted through the everyday practices and speech acts of regular people, making discourse a key site of resistance

Security @ Swedish Defence University, "Opening Security: recovering
critical scholarship as political," *Critical Studies on Security*,

Opening security, as noted, is necessary because [the politics of
security are found in contestations over meanings of security in
particular enactments.]{.underline} Huysmans 'take on the Copenhagen
School's speech act approach is helpful here. As he points out, ['the
notion of "act" is central for understanding the political investment
made in moving towards studying security as a speech
act']{.underline}(Huysmans2011, 372). Rather than focusing on the
conditions of possibility for speaking security, Huysmans proposes that
it is the act that 'conditions the political critique of security
practice that is possible within this approach'(2011). He goes on to
note that [to act 'is neither arriving at a scene nor fleeing from it,
but actually engaging in its creation']{.underline}(Huysmans2011, 373,
quoting Isin 2008). What is more, 'an act actualized in a decision
introduces responsibility towards others. One cannot hide behind
necessity, routine, habits, in the act of security creation. [Speaking
security is a decision to rupture a situation with certain calculable
consequences for others']{.underline} (2011). Conceptualized in this
way, [security practices enacted in a particular moment are deeply
political.]{.underline} Studying the politics of security consequently
requires attention to these acts and their conditions of possibility.10
Huysmans pushes this idea further, suggesting that the creative speech
act which produces political consequences for which those involved in
the decision are accountable, also requires 'the affirmation of
undecidability, the radical openness and the creativity of being, the
possibility of the unexpected; actions that cannot be fully folded back
into calculability and instituted normativity' (Huysmans2011, 374). This
move, which chal-lenges epistemological conventions of IR, is key to an
opening of Security Studies. Husymans recognizes this when he proposes
that in a focus on the speechact, we canretain'a radical distance from
normative and causal orders: its politicality resides in its rupturing
quality'(2011). This is most obvious when we are talking about the
spectacular decisions that, as Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde (1998)
maintain, move security from the broader political realm to the
exception realm of national security as 'high politics'--but this is
also exactly what Huysmans criticizes: Speech acts of security enact a
sharp distinction between the exceptional and the banal, the political
and the everyday, the routine and creative. This implies an elitist
vision of politics. Securitizing analysis mostly focuses on leaders or
politicians--'statesmen'--who speak security with sufficient clout while
ordinary people continue their everyday lives (2011,375).11What about
[all those everyday 'security nothings' where there is 'less an
actualization of a critical decision and more a continuous process of
assembling objects, subjects and practices,]{.underline}' asks Huysmans
(2011, 377)? As he outlines, drawing on the work of Luise Amoore and
Marieke deGoede (2008), [the everyday practices of the gathering of data
through bureaucratic management practices, surveillance, and more needs
to be rendered political because it is used to profile, to distinguish,
to mark boundaries--essentially to securitize ever larger areas of
life.]{.underline} What is more, the decisions involved as well as those
involved in making them are not spectacular, and [the ruptures they
represent are dispersed and thus garner much less attention. However,
they are no less]{.underline} (and maybe more) [consequential for those
on the receiving end of official security
politics/policy]{.underline}--Booth's'voiceless'. The many bureaucrats
and security agents that decide on and imple-ment these endless security
acts 'are the "petty sovereigns" who enact the sovereign power to decide
arbitrarily' even while they would likely maintain that they are 'only
following the rules'(Huysmans2011, 380, quoting Butler 2004).12Indeed,
[part of the technocratic approach to the management of populations
involves leading so-called ordinary people to believe that real
political decisions are made only at the level of elite politics instead
of in the realm of everyday decision-making.]{.underline} I would argue
that [not only is attention to the everyday necessary because it is the
site where security practices are being dispersed]{.underline} and
produce effects, [but also because the everyday is]{.underline}, for
many, [a more realistic site of resistance. An opening of security,
which focuses on the everyday enactments of security, makes this
possible.]{.underline}13 [Recognizing that 'security nothings' are
indeed deeply political recalls the feminist slogan 'the personal is
political': it is only in attention to the particular of the everyday
that we can fully grasp the impact of security.]{.underline} Cynthia
Enloe's work has long exhibited this insight. Over 25 years ago, in her
widely acclaimed Bananas, Beaches & Bases, Enloe proposed that 'one of
the simplest and most disturbing feminist insights is that" the personal
is political"'(1990, 195). In the revised edition of this classic, she
clarifies:' Asserting that "the personal is political" is disturbing,
intentionally disturbing, because it means that relationships we once
imagined were (and many of our friends and colleagues still prefer to
think are) private or merely social are in fact infused with
power'(2014, 348). What is more, she urges us to consider that the
political is personal also, and that 'men who dominate public life in so
many countries \[\...\] have used their myriad forms of public power to
construct private relationships in ways that have bolstered their own
masculinized political control'(2014). Enloe's work, like much feminist
work in IR, points out that [security politics are to be found in the
everyday]{.underline}--and that paying attention to particular' security
nothings'--hearing and amplifying rather than becoming the voice of the
voiceless--profoundly challenges the stories we tell.

### 2NC Alt---Genealogy Key

#### Genealogical critique that attends to the knowledge production undergirding contemporary security practices is key to challenging global systems of oppression and structural violence

[Since contexts and our location within them shape, limit, and enable
our research, critical scholarship]{.underline} further [necessitates
tracing]{.underline} the [history]{.underline} of a genre
(Gattungsgeschichte) [through]{.underline} a [genealogy]{.underline} of
a concept, idea, or issue area. [Such a genealogical trace]{.underline},
Vivienne Jabri asserts, [must be performed in relation to the current
context because 'the lived experiences of past generations come to form
the memory traces of the present, \[they are\] constitutive of life in
the present']{.underline}(2004, 266). For example, in their discussion
of sexual violence as a weapon of war, Maria Eriksson Baaz and Maria
Stern (2013) start byq uerying the not just 'the dominant story of
sexual and gender-based violence (the "Gendered" Story, as we call
it)'(14) asking questions about its plot, character construc-tion, and
more (see also Wibben2011), but also by digging into its genealogy 'by
first exploring the main account that precedes and haunts it (the
"Sexed" Story)' (Eriksson Baaz and Stern2013, 14). [The current social
and political context is 'a reflection of a distinct and particular
articulation of the present, emergent from a particular and distinct
reading of history]{.underline}, a particular subjectivity'(Jabri2004,
266). [Security Studies is not a neutral field of study but an
articulation of a particular configuration of events--which can and must
be challenged]{.underline} as critical feminists, postcolonial scholars
and poststructur-alists all point out, albeit from different starting
points. [Excavating these genealogies makes past transformations visible
and reveals potential points for further opening security.]{.underline}
While a deepening and broadening allows for some transformation as well,
an opening directly addresses the politics of Security Studies notj ust
in the abstract, but also in specific enactments. [To open security we
need to ask: 'How in the present does power operate?' and pay attention
'to structures of domination that permeate these
transformations']{.underline}(Jabri2004, 267). Jabri suggests that 'it
is relations of power that ultimately reveal [the congealment of
hegemonic, institutionalized practices]{.underline} that [determine the
legitimate, the acceptable, and the remits of
politics']{.underline}(2004). [Critical approaches challenge us to trace
the genealogies of what security has come to mean in particular
spatio-temporal locations]{.underline} (see also Ciutǎ2009), [while
engaging in a social analysis of those locations to articulate an
embedded critique]{.underline}. Security Studies is deeply implicated in
justifying and upholding the current interna-tional system; a system
shaped, in large part, by European imperialism and colonialism. Its
[knowledge practices are part and parcel of the (epistemic) violence
embedded in IR--they are implicated in creating and maintaining the
insecurities and injustices that critical scholarship should aim to
transform. Opening security lays bare how IR's limits on what
constitutes an acceptable research agenda, with attendant notions of
objectivity and scientism, negates politics and thus denies the
political nature of all knowledge claims. It is imperative]{.underline},
therefore, [to carefully scrutinize the politics of thinking about
security]{.underline} indifferent ways and, conversely, their enactment.
Insisting on the politics of Security Studies requires greater focus on
the axis of opening, in addition to a broadening and deepening. [This
opening]{.underline}, a strand of critical research that has been
present all along but has not been explicitly named, [is necessary to
generate new security imaginaries.]{.underline} Opening security
necessarily calls the frame into question and reveals how 'the frame
never quite contained the scene it was meant to limit \[\...\] something
was already outside which made the very sense of the inside possible,
recognizable'(Butler2009, 9). Security Studies has been too narrowly
focused on particular forms of (state) violence directed mostly at other
states. [Opening security with a critical (feminist) approach implies
challenging epistemic, direct, and structural violence,]{.underline} as
manifested in varied sites of study.[16It also entails revealing how
Security Studies frameworks contribute to these violences by limiting
what can be seen and heard]{.underline}, an endeavor which feminist
scholarship has successfully taken on. A more rigorous use of curiosity
and imagination would also allow non-feminist scholars in IR to see
that, despite claims to the contrary, 'the frame never quite determined
what it is we see, think, recognize, apprehend' (Butler2009, 9) and that
Security Studies, to remain relevant, must be disrupted by attention to
particular enactments of security that have always exceeded these
frames. All the while critical scholars need to remain reflexive and
explore the limits of their own horizons: What is it that we do not yet
know? How can we write and produce knowledges in such a way that allow
for the next person to question and displace them, if necessary? How
might we incorporate ambiguity and uncertainty for a more accurate
account of security that can be un-made and re-made, again and again?
[Only by recogniz-ing security as made, examining how it is enacted in
multiple locations, can we challenge the politics of security along with
its (oft violent) ties to the capitalist state. If we are serious about
emancipatory knowledges, we must challenge the ways Security Studies
supports intersecting systems of oppression, from racism and sexism to
imperialism.]{.underline}

## AT Permutation

### 2NC AT Perm

#### The perm fails -- the call to "do both" only makes critical opposition subservient to the larger operation of the North Atlantic war machine. Appropriation of bits of critical rhetoric is precisely the mechanism by which discourses of war and racialization gain legitimacy.

**Chandler 22** \[David, Professor of International Relations at the
University of Westminster, "Opinion -- The Myth of Being Anti-Racist and
Anti-War in the Ukraine Conflict," *E-International Relations*,

accessed 07/22/22, GDI-JCR\]

It would be nice if the choices we are confronted with by the Russian
invasion of Ukraine were pure ones. However, [much of the anti-war
coverage of the conflict has been overladen with racial and colonial
stereotypes.]{.underline} This has been picked up on in a fair amount of
media coverage, with articles such as: 'Please, Stop Using Racist
Language To Talk About The Ukraine And Russia Conflict: If you find
yourself connecting more with this European war, ask yourself why';
'Arabs decry 'racist' double standard in Ukraine media commentary',
'Trevor Noah slams media for racist remarks on Ukraine: War 'was
Europe's entire thing', 'Coverage of Ukraine has exposed long-standing
racist biases in Western media'. What has been particularly picked up on
has been the media tropes of shock that war could take place in 'the
heart of Europe' with the bombing of major European cities and the
outrage that 'civilization' should be so rudely upset by Putin's
'medieval' thuggery. The Washington Post, provides a disturbing
snapshot: A commentator on a French news program said, "We're not
talking about Syrians fleeing bombs of the Syrian regime backed by
Putin; we're talking about Europeans leaving in cars that look like ours
to save their lives." On the BBC, a former deputy prosecutor general of
Ukraine declared, "It's very emotional for me because I see European
people with blue eyes and blond hair ... being killed every day." Even
an Al Jazeera anchor said, "These are not obviously refugees trying to
get away from areas in the Middle East," while an ITV News reporter
said, "Now the unthinkable has happened to them, and this is not a
developing, Third World nation; this is Europe." The political or
ethical purity of calling out the war and supporting the fight for
Ukrainian independence would seem potentially threatened or undermined
by the media double-standards of care and concern for white or European
victims of conflict. [Many people have been sensitised to the double
standards of Western care and concern with the high profile of Black
Lives Matter and Rhodes Must Fall campaigns.]{.underline} As students of
International Relations, we are no doubt aware of Aimé Césaire and
Frantz Fanon's powerful indictments of these double standards in concern
over slaughter in Europe when the violence of colonialism was
ignored.\[1\] [This is where the calls for, what can be called
'both/and', can seem compelling.]{.underline} I have noticed on the
social media feeds of some friends and colleagues that [there is a
concern to legitimate the position that one can be both for the Ukraine
and also make a stand against the racializing terms of the anti-war
discussion. The implication is that we can have a pure anti-war
discussion without a racializing element.]{.underline} It is this
assumption that I'd like to bring into question in this short piece. It
seems clear that [the relation between being anti-war and pro-war is one
of mutuality rather than opposition.]{.underline} Other friends of mine
who have been busy on social media with anti-war work seem to have no
hesitation in demonizing countries and populations already at the sharp
end of US and EU sanctions and intimidation. A good example is the
popular tweet 'Ukraine vs Russia: Who Does Europe Support' where the
whole of Europe is united with the exceptions of the isolated and
pro-Russian, Serbia and Belarus. [The moral opprobrium of being
pro-Russian of course is co-constitutive of the moral superiority of
being pro-European and pro-Ukrainian.]{.underline} When even the
contrarian commentator Brendan O'Neil is posting demands on social
media, like 'Fuck off, Belarus', the sense of manipulation and
desperation in the anti-war posturing seems too powerful to ignore. This
[anti-war posturing seems to be indistinguishable from pro-war
posturing. In this feverish climate it is little surprise that the
anti-warmongers are rewriting international political relations. Typical
is the pro-war/anti-war European Union which, on the back of the
conflict, has declared a "watershed moment" in its history.]{.underline}
The EU's treaties bar it from funding operations with military or
defence implications so €5 million is being found 'off-budget' in the
EU's first ever interference in a conflict to finance the purchase and
delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under
attack. Similarly Germany is making its own historic shift to return to
military intervention in Europe, sending 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500
Stinger anti-aircraft defence systems to the Ukraine. [It would be nice
if it was possible to make neat demarcations. It would be nice if it was
possible to distinguish an individual's personal ideals and desires from
the political and ideological context in which they are
expressed.]{.underline} Yet, what seems inescapable is the fact [that
anti-war political interventions in our contemporary times are
necessarily indistinguishable from pro-war ones. The 'anti-war' movement
that has politically mobilized nearly the entirety of international
society, from the UN, NATO and the EU down to UEFA]{.underline} and
International Olympic Committee, [not only is waging its own war
'against war' but is also retrospectively legitimating the Western-led
military interventions]{.underline} of the recent past. In staging this
ethical unity against Russia's invasion of the Ukraine, the lack of
legitimacy of any comparison to US-led and NATO bombing campaigns
against Belgrade, Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya is chilling. [The
possibility of a non-racializing or non-colonial anti-war discussion is
premised upon the promise of another type of war, one that is even more
morally pure.]{.underline} [To refuse the discourses of war and
racialization it is necessary to do more than place them in critical
relation to those of anti-war and anti-racialization.]{.underline}
Instead, [we should refuse to distinguish the two.]{.underline} It is
only in the relation, in the contra-positioning, that war gains its
moral grounding.\[2\] [War needs the legitimacy of anti-war campaigning,
racializing needs the legitimacy of anti-racialization]{.underline}, all
this can be seen, if we wish to see it, in discussions of the war in the
Ukraine. [The outcome of this war is that the international order is
secured rather than destabilized as pariah states are demoralized or
demonized further and leading international institutions are militarized
and relegitimized. This is a war that threatens us all.]{.underline}
