# Notes

### overview

The focus of this file -- because of arguments at the workshop, is on
biotech. We included AI as well to provide a model of what a file might
look like when you get back home for the season versus AI teams. Neither
of those sections reflect the full impact/impact turn debate in the lit
-- but does give you a sampling.

Remember that you can access terminal impact back up and defense in
other files if the cards in this file don't seem sufficient

### Why not cyber? 

Cyber is a bit trickier -- few people argue that cyber attacks are good
outside of a very specific context \[ie people do praise Ukrainian cyber
defenders who hacked Russia at start of invasion\].

There are cyber offense good in the cyber aff files; however, none of
them really say that defense trades off with offense -- but 1-2 cards to
this end would allow you to construct a cyber focus tradeoff argument,
with cyber offense as a net benefit

[The year 2020 was profoundly challenging for citizens, companies, and
governments around the world.]{.underline} As covid-19 spread, requiring
far-reaching health and safety restrictions, [artificial
intelligence]{.underline} (AI) [applications played a crucial role in
saving lives and fostering economic resilience. Research and development
(R&D) to enhance core AI capabilities, from autonomous driving and
natural language processing to quantum computing, continued
unabated]{.underline}. Baidu was at the forefront of many important AI
breakthroughs in 2020. This article outlines five significant advances
with implications for combating covid-19 as well as transforming the
future of our economies and society.

4\. Quantum computing The trend---and why it matters. [Quantum computing
made significant inroads]{.underline} in 2020, including the Jiuzhang
computer's achievement of quantum supremacy. [This carries significance
for AI, since quantum computing has the potential to supercharge AI
applications]{.underline} compared to binary-based classical computers.
For example, [quantum computing]{.underline} could be [used to run a
generative machine learning model through a larger dataset]{.underline}
than a classical computer can process[, thus making the model more
accurate and useful in real-world settings]{.underline}. [Advanced
technologies such as deep learning algorithms are also playing an
increasingly critical role in the development of quantum computing
research.]{.underline} Baidu's innovations. Baidu achieved a number of
technical breakthroughs in 2020 that promise to bridge AI and quantum
computing. In May, Baidu launched Paddle Quantum, a quantum machine
learning development toolkit that can help scientists and developers
quickly build and train quantum neural network models and provide
advanced quantum computing applications. The open-source toolkit both
supports developers building quantum AI applications, and helps deep
learning enthusiasts develop quantum computing. In September, Baidu
entered cloud-based quantum computing with the launch of Quantum Leaf,
which provides quantum development kits such as QCompute, and can
shorten the life cycle of quantum programming and help realize a
'closed-loop' quantum tool chain.

## AI investment now -- government investment 

### 1nc/2ac

#### Federal spending on AI up across agencies -- including those without scientific mission 

**Wiggers, writes about artificial intelligence for VentureBeat, 2021**

This week, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that it'll form a
committee to advise federal agencies on AI research and developments.
Called the [National Artificial Intelligence Advisory
Committee]{.underline} and supported by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology and the White House's National AI Initiative
Office, it'll [focus on a range of issues related to AI,]{.underline}
including the current state of U.S. competitiveness and how AI can
enhance opportunities for different geographic regions. [The committee's
formation comes as federal spending on AI technologies ramps up during
the pandemic.]{.underline} According to Deltek, [identifiable federal
spending on AI rose to nearly \$1 billion in 2020, making it one of the
fastest-growing emerging tech investment areas]{.underline}. While that
figure fell short of estimates --- Bloomberg Government [projected that
the U.S. would pour over \$6 billion in AI-related R&D projects in 2021
--- it's a sign of renewed enthusiasm from the government in backing
technologies that could yield \$13 trillion in economic benefits by
2030. Former Google CEO]{.underline} Eric Schmidt is [among those who've
urged lawmakers to bolster funding in the AI space while incentivizing
public-private partnerships]{.underline} to develop AI applications
across government agencies. The National Security Commission on
Artificial Intelligence estimates the U.S. needs to spend \$32 billion
over the next few years to win the AI race with China, among other
rivals. To achieve this, President Joe Biden has proposed spending 2% of
the U.S.'s total economic output --- or GDP --- on science, up from
around 0.7%. That would equate to roughly \$418 billion at last year's
GDP level, up from about \$146 billion. The report shows that the
federal government isn't close to approaching Biden's target. But it
reveals that [AI spending across agencies is on the rise generally, up
50% compared with 2018.]{.underline} Moreover, U.S. [AI spending is
growing at agencies even without a primarily scientific
mission]{.underline}, the report reveals --- such as the Departments of
Justice, Transportation, and State. And [AI capabilities including
robotic process automation are increasingly being used by the government
for research, surveillance, trend analysis, and vaccine
development.]{.underline}

over the three-year period.]{.underline} [R&D spending reached \$1.2
billion over the same 2018-to-2020 timeframe]{.underline}, despite the
fact that AI spend from the Department of Transportation, Department of
Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration decreased by a combined \$81 million.

[Agencies with substantial AI spending outside the top ten included the
Department of Veterans Affairs (\$38 million), the Department of
Commerce (\$37 million), the Department of Agriculture (\$28 million)
and the Social Security Administration (\$26 million). Spending on
autonomy across all agencies totaled \$520 million from 2018 to
2020,]{.underline} followed by intelligent systems (\$122 million),
machine learning (\$114 million), augmented reality (\$39 million), deep
learning (\$26 million), and virtual reality (\$24 million).

[Economic investment in artificial intelligence technology continues to
rise]{.underline}. A moneytransfers.com analysis shows [that private
investment in AI in 2021 was \$93.5 billion --- more than double what it
was in 2020]{.underline}.

[The total amount of funding raised by venture capitalists for
A]{.underline}I startups [has increased significantly]{.underline} since
2017. However, the number of companies qualifying for funding is
shrinking.

[The AI sector\'s value will exceed the \$135 billion mark in 2022,
growing at a combined annual growth rate of 38% between now and
2030]{.underline}, according to analysts. [This increase can be
attributed to improved performance by algorithms, increased use cases
for AI products and services and an influx of startups into the
market.]{.underline}

[The U.S and China lead in private investments in the field.
T]{.underline}hough the U.S. currently holds an upper hand, China has
been rapidly gaining ground following significant investments in AI. [By
the end of 2020, the U.S had invested over \$23 billion in private
investments in the sector]{.underline}. [That was more than twice the
\$9.9 billion that China did.]{.underline} However, [China has set its
sights on becoming the world\'s AI innovation hub, targeting to grow its
market share to \$150 billion.]{.underline}

5\. AI chips

The trend---and why it matters. [AI hardware continued to
develop]{.underline} in 2020, [with the launch of several AI chips
customized for specialized tasks]{.underline}. While an ordinary
processor is capable of supporting AI tasks, [AI-specific
processors]{.underline} are modified with particular systems that can
[optimize performance for tasks like deep learning]{.underline}. [As AI
applications become more widespread, any increase in performance or
reduction in cost can unlock more value for companies]{.underline} that
operate a wide network of data centers for commercial cloud services,
and can facilitate the company's internal operations.

Baidu's innovations. At Baidu World 2020, [the company offered a glimpse
into its next-generation AI processor, the Kunlun 2]{.underline}, which
it plans to put into mass production in early 2021. The chip

maximum computational capability is over three times that of the
previous generation]{.underline}, the Kunlun 1. [The Kunlun chips are
characterized by high performance, low cost, and high flexibility, which
can support a broad range of AI applications and scenarios, helping
foster greater AI adoption and reducing usage costs. More than 20,000
Kunlun 1 chips have now been deployed]{.underline} to support Baidu's
search engine and Baidu Cloud partners since they launched in 2018,
[empowering industrial manufacturing, smart cities, smart

# AI Good/not so bad -- Impact Debate

## AI Good -- Laundry list 

### 1nc/2ac

#### AI provides laundry list of benefits 

**CSU Global, 21**

\[\"Why is AI Important?\", CSU Global, 7/5/21,
https://csuglobal.edu/blog/why-ai-important, accessed 7/6/22, GDI-cc\]

[Artificial intelligence technology offers several critical
benefits]{.underline} that make it an excellent tool for virtually any
modern organization, [including:]{.underline}

[Automation - AI is able to automate a repetitive task that was
previously done manually]{.underline}, without feeling any fatigue or
having to take breaks like a human employee would need to do.

[Enhancement - AI can make products and services smarter and more
effective]{.underline}, improving experiences for end-users, via
capabilities like optimizing conversation bots or customer service
menus, and delivering better product recommendations.

[Analysis - AI can analyze data at a much faster rate than
humans]{.underline}, allowing it to find patterns much more quickly, and
it can also analyze much larger datasets than humans, allowing it to
uncover patterns humans would simply miss.

[Accuracy - AI can be trained to become more accurate than
humans]{.underline}, utilizingits ability to harvest and interpret data
to come up with better decisions for tasks like picking financial
investments or identifying cancerous growths on x-rays.

[ROI - AI maximizes the value of data since it's able to do a better job
analyzing complex, multi-variate relationships]{.underline}, without
having to take any breaks and with fewer mistakes, making it an
incredibly important technology for any business that relies on data and
operates at scale.

Simply put, [AI allows organizations to make better decisions, improving
core business processes by increasing both the speed and accuracy of
strategic decision-making processes]{.underline}.

The reason there's so much talk about how AI could revolutionize the
world and change the future is that [AI solutions are already being
applied in virtually every industry, with excellent
results.]{.underline}

[Here's]{.underline} just a handful of [specific applications where
artificial intelligence has proven to be incredibly
effective]{.underline}:

[Healthcare - AI applications are being used to deliver personalized
medicine]{.underline}, providing patients with reminders about when to
take their medicine, and suggestions about which specific exercises they
should perform.

[Retail - AI technology is applied in retail environments to handle
stock management]{.underline}, design more effective store layouts, and
provide personalized shopping recommendations via Amazon's "You May Also
Like" suggestions, as well as personalized viewing suggestions via
Netflix's machine learning-driven recommendation algorithm.

[Manufacturing - AI solutions are used to forecast load and demand for
factories]{.underline}, ensuring they're run as efficiently as possible
by helping to make better decisions about logistics and planning for
materials ordering, timetables to project completion, etc.

[Banking - AI systems are being used to review financial transactions to
detect fraudulent activity]{.underline}, assess credit scores with
greater accuracy, and automate tasks requiring manual data input and
data management.

[Life Sciences - AI technology is being applied to test new
medicines]{.underline}, allowing organizations to bring them to market
sooner, and to analyze large and complex data sets that help discover
new, more effective therapies and pharmaceutical drugs.

Clearly, AI has already been applied to a whole host of important
processes, but there are hundreds or even thousands of additional
applications for virtually every sector of the modern economy.

What makes AI such a game-changing technology? The fact that it can
perform similar tasks as human beings, but faster, and with fewer
mistakes.

## AI Good -- Clean Energy 

### 1nc/2ac

#### AI creates an effective energy transition -- intelligent coordination layer helps energy-system personnel identify patterns in data and improve energy systems over time

**Mehlum et al, 21**

\[Espen, Head of Energy, Materials & Infrastructure ath the World
Economic Forum, \"This is how AI will accelerate the energy
transition\", World Economic Forum, 9/1/21,
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/this-is-how-ai-will-accelerate-the-energy-transition/,
accessed 7/6/22, GDI-cc\]

[Three key trends are driving AI's potential to accelerate energy
transition]{.underline}:

[1. Energy-intensive sectors including power, transport, heavy industry
and buildings are at the beginning of historic decarbonization
processes, driven by growing government and consumer demand for rapid
reductions in CO2 emissions]{.underline}. The scale of these transitions
is huge: [BloombergNEF
estimates](https://about.bnef.com/new-energy-outlook/) that in the
energy sector alone, achieving net-zero emissions will require between
\$92 trillion and \$173 trillion of infrastructure investments by 2050.
Even small gains in flexibility, efficiency or capacity in clean energy
and low-carbon industry can therefore lead to trillions in value and
savings.

[2. As electricity supplies more sectors and applications, the power
sector is becoming the core pillar of the global energy supply. Ramping
up renewable energy deployment to decarbonize the globally expanding
power sector will mean more power is supplied by intermittent
sources]{.underline} (such as solar and wind), creating new demand for
forecasting, coordination, and flexible consumption to ensure that power
grids can be operated safely and reliably.

[3. The transition to low-carbon energy systems is driving the rapid
growth of distributed power generation]{.underline}, distributed storage
and advanced demand-response capabilities, which need to be orchestrated
and integrated through more networked, transactional power grids.

[Navigating these trends presents huge strategic and operational
challenges to the energy system and to energy-intensive industries. This
is where AI comes in: by creating an intelligent coordination layer
across the generation, transmission and use of energy, AI can help
energy-system stakeholders identify patterns and insights in data, learn
from experience and improve system performance over time, and predict
and model possible outcomes of complex, multivariate
situations.]{.underline}

[AI is already [proving its
value](https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/bd3a196d-a88f-45af-bbc6-e0b00790fba8/EMCompass_Note_81-05-web.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=n72pj5g) to
the energy transition in multiple domains, driving measurable
improvements in [renewable energy
forecasting](https://www.ey.com/en_us/power-utilities/why-artificial-intelligence-is-a-game-changer-for-renewable-energy), [grid
operations and
optimization](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/13/ai-powered-bidding-platform-for-australias-biggest-solar-farm/), [coordination
of distributed energy assets and demand-side
management](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Topics/Innovation-and-Technology/IRENA_Landscape_Solution_07.pdf?la=en&hash=57385C8E232455C58F845598879A9B8BFF55373B),
and [materials innovation and
discovery](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/12/f58/Moving%20Applications%20of%20AI%20and%20ML%20from%20Materials%20Design%20Discovery%20thru%20Process%20Design%20Development_B%20Valentine.pdf)]{.underline}.
But while AI's application in the energy sector has proven promising so
far, innovation and adoption remain limited. That presents a tremendous
opportunity to accelerate transition towards the zero-emission, highly
efficient and interconnected energy system we need tomorrow.

### Extensions - AI -- wind and solar reliability 

#### AI improves reliability of clean energy by analyzing data and making predictions to improve the energy transition solar and wind specific

accessed 7/7/22, GDI-cc\]

[Excess solar or wind power is stored during low-demand times and used
when energy demand is high. As a result, AI can improve reliability of
solar and wind power by analyzing enormous amounts of meteorological
data and using this information to make predictions and decisions about
when to gather, store, and distribute wind or solar power]{.underline}.
On the other hand, [AI is also used in smart grids to help balance the
grid. AI analyzes the grid before and after intermittent units are
absorbed and learns from this to help reduce congestion and renewable
energy curtailment.23]{.underline}

[AI is also gaining ground in Latin America. Argentina has embarked on a
modernization effort of its power grid infrastructure by investing in
automation of power distribution, remote reading of energy meters across
several cities, and the implementation of renewable energy
generators]{.underline}. In Baja California, IFC is helping CENACE
(Centro Nacional de Control de Energía) model the effect of cloud
coverage on solar generation to help balance the grid with batteries.
The AI algorithms developed help the ISO react in seconds to provide
primary regulation to stabilize the grid. In much of Sub-Saharan Africa,
access to home electricity remains a challenge. Africans spend as much
as \$17 billion a year on firewood and fuels such as kerosene to power
primitive generators.24

There are glimmers of hope, however. [Azuri Technologies developed a
pay-as-yougo smart-solar solution used in East Africa and Nigeria.
Azuri's HomeSmart solution is built on AI. It learns home energy needs
and adjusts power output accordingly---by automatically dimming lights,
battery charging, and slowing fans]{.underline}, for example---to match
the customer's typical daily requirements. The company recently secured
\$26 million in private equity investment to expand its solutions across
Africa.25

### Extensions AI -- smart grid 

#### AI-managed smart grids introduce new solutions for renewable energy -- they enable communication and precise data

**Makala and Bakovic, 20**

accessed 7/7/22, GDI-cc\]

[The power sector has a promising future with the advent of solutions
such as AI-managed smart grids. These are electrical grids that allow
two-way communication between utilities and consumers.2 Smart grids are
embedded with an information layer that allows communication between its
various components so they can better respond to quick changes in energy
demand or urgent situations. This information layer, created through
widespread installation of smart meters and sensors, allows for data
collection, storage, and analysis.]{.underline}3

Phasor measurement units ([PMUs]{.underline}), or synchrophasors, [are
another essential element of the modern smart grid. They enable
real-time measurement and alignment of data from multiple remote points
across the grid. This creates a current, precise, and integrated view of
the entire power system]{.underline}, facilitating better grid
management.

[Paired with powerful data analytics, these smart-grid elements have
helped improve the reliability, security, and efficiency of electricity
transmission and distribution networks.]{.underline}4,5 Given the large
volume and diverse structures of such data[, AI techniques such as
machine learning are best suited for their analysis and use.6 This data
analysis can be used for a variety of purposes, including fault
detection, predictive maintenance, power quality monitoring, and
renewable energy forecasting]{.underline}.7

[Innovation in information and communications technologies]{.underline}
(ICT), cloud computing, big-data analytics, and artificial intelligence
[have supported the proliferation of smart metering. The widespread use
of smart meters and advanced sensor technology has created huge amounts
of data that is generated rapidly]{.underline}. This data requires new
methods for storage, transfer, and analysis. For illustration sake, with
a sampling rate of four times per hour, one million smart meters
installed in a smart grid would generate over 35 billion records.8

## AI Good -- Carbon emissions 

### 1nc/2ac

#### AI provides specific data at low costs and generates insights to improve climate resilience, facilitating decrease in carbon emissions 

**Degot, 21**

\[Charlotte, managing director at BCG GAMMA, Boston\'s consulting
group\'s entity dedicaterd to data science, \"How AI\'s full power can
stimulate climate change action\", World Economic Forum, 9/8/21,
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/time-to-utilise-the-full-power-of-ai-to-accelerate-our-fight-against-climate-change-301cb3f9d4/,
accessed 7/6/22, GDI-cc\]

[AI can help measure and reduce emissions for any given
institution]{.underline}

For a company to master its climate impact, it needs to take three
steps: measure the baseline accurately, set targets, and act.

Too often, companies are blocked at the first step. The latest data from
the CDP shows that only 31% of companies, which publicly disclose their
emissions footprint, measure their impact exhaustively across all
relevant categories (e.g., including supply chain emissions). As a
result, companies struggle to move forward with meaningful targets and
successful action plans.

[Innovative AI-based solutions can enable companies to tackle the three
steps in the same tool, empowering the full organization to make the
best decisions regarding its climate impact.]{.underline} These kinds of
comprehensive solutions, such as [BCG's CO2
AI](https://www.bcg.com/en-cz/publications/2021/ai-to-reduce-carbon-emissions),
create a 30% reduction in emissions. [AI-based solutions are a clear
step-change versus conventional manual approaches, enabling quick,
reliable and granular baselining of the full emission footprint with
greater accuracy.]{.underline}

Beyond that, [powerful AI-based forecasts and simulations empower
leaders to take the right choices to reduce emissions at scale and
impactfully drive their climate journey]{.underline}. In the case of a
large retail company, insights generated by BCG's CO2 AI increased
confidence in the achievability of a net zero target and helped
accelerate the timeline to net zero by 10 years.

[Another good example for AI-powered decisions that reduce emissions at
scale is Google's partnership
with [electricityMap](https://www.electricitymap.org/map). By utilizing
electricityMap -- an AI-powered platform that shows in real-time how
clean electricity is around the world and provides past, current and
forecasted carbon footprint data for electricity by country]{.underline}
-- Google manages to align computing tasks with times of low-carbon
electricity supply in the grid and, thus, reduces CO2e emissions from
electricity consumption.

Finally, [AI-based optimisation of process parameters helps identify
untapped potentials to save both greenhouse gas emissions and
cost]{.underline}. In the case of a global steel company, 10% of CO2e
emissions and 1% of costs could be saved by employing state-of-the-art
AI models to streamline carbon-intensive industrial operations.

AI can enable innovative business models to help the climate

Over the past years, global research has made strong progress in the
development of innovative carbon abatement technologies, including: i)
lower carbon fuels, ii) engineered carbon capture and storage, and iii)
agricultural carbon sequestration.

Let's take a deeper look into agricultural carbon sequestration to
illustrate AI's great potential to help advance this technology and
deliver impact at scale.

First, [smart AI-based algorithms can help identify the best-suited
lands and soils in a very cost-efficient and scalable way]{.underline},
e.g., by learning from existing carbon sequestration action data and
analysing vast agricultural, meteorological, and geological databases.

Second, [AI can help perform large-scale carbon measurement in the soil
at a low cost]{.underline}. [Given the previously high cost of this
measurement, AI is a major enabler for the financial model behind
agricultural carbon sequestration.]{.underline}

Third, [AI can be used with satellite imagery, for instance, to ensure
that farmers comply with sowing practice changes committed to the people
investing in the process and expecting to sell the CO2 certificates
later]{.underline}. In total, AI will play an absolutely critical role
to scale and deploy carbon sequestration with agriculture around the
globe.

AI can improve resilience of our societies to climate hazards

[As this summer's weather catastrophes have proven across geographies,
adapting our societies to climate change action is a major challenge.
Again, AI can aid by helping manage the wide variety, diversity and
volumes of data, and generating life-saving insights to improve
resilience.]{.underline}

For instance, Google's ["Hydronet"
solution](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/09/the-technology-behind-our-recent.html) can
help identify the most critical vulnerabilities in the case of extreme
river floods with unprecedented lead times and accuracy. As such, it is
utilised to help improve flood forecasting in India and Bangladesh,
covering more than 250 million people at risk.

past decade across many medical subspecialties.[ ]{.underline}[Experts

[A recent [Nature
Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01614-0) article
discusses promising uses of artificial intelligence in medicine,
particularly in medical imaging and big data integration]{.underline},
and considers technical and ethical challenges for their applications in
improving human health. Here is a quick summary of the review and the
implications for population health.

Imaging at the Forefront of AI in Medicine

In the interpretation of medical images --- a niche where AI models have
made great strides --- the AI workflow starts with images that have been
read and annotated by human experts. [The AI model can analyze and
interpret images and compare its interpretation to that of human
experts. AI can then learn and refine its interpretation models over
time and after analyzing numerous images. AI tools have shown that they
can meet, or even exceed, experts' performance across medical
specialties that rely on human interpretation]{.underline} ---
namely, [radiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0447-x), [pathology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03512-4), [dermatology](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21056), [gastroenterology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16777-6),
and [ophthalmology](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2588763/).
For instance, [one
study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0583-3) used AI
methods to analyze whole-slide images and demonstrated that their model
was more accurate in predicting patient survival from malignant
mesothelioma, compared to current pathology practices. [Another
study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16777-6#Abs1) demonstrated
that an AI model for the optical diagnosis of colorectal cancer can
achieve precision comparable to that of skilled endoscopists. Such
advances have demonstrated how AI can refine diagnostic accuracy and
improve patient outcome predictions, while enabling a faster clinical
workflow and more efficient use of healthcare resources.

Many Promising Avenues for AI in Medicine

[In addition to AI for medical image analysis, the
review [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01614-0) presents
three promising avenues for AI. First, AI can learn from non-image data
sources, such as text and genome sequences, and can broaden the array of
possible datasets that can be used for medical insights and drug
discovery. AI methods have been used to predict outcomes from medical
signal data,]{.underline} such as electroencephalograms (EEG),
electrocardiograms, and audio data. For example, AI
was [recently](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31242361/) applied to EEG
signals from clinically unresponsive patients with brain injuries to
detect brain activity, an important predictor of long-term recovery.
 [AI can also integrate multiple sources of medical data for improved
medical diagnosis]{.underline}. For example,
one [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31167662/) for diagnosing
respiratory disorders took audio recordings of patients' coughs as well
as reports of their symptoms as input to enhance the diagnosis of
respiratory disorders. AI models have also been applied to more complex
inputs, such as electronic health records, with various data such as
vital signs, prescriptions, and laboratory results.

[Second, AI can learn from data without any labels or
annotations]{.underline} (e.g. image labelled with a known medical
diagnosis), [a process known as unsupervised learning]{.underline}.
Labeled data can often be costly and time-consuming to obtain. AI
advancements that can use poorly labeled data can widen the landscape of
applications in medicine. For example, clustering algorithms can
organize unlabeled data points by grouping similar data points together
have been applied to several conditions such
as [sepsis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104070/), [breast
cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31959985/),
and [endometriosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32596513/) to
identify clinically meaningful patient subgroups.

[Finally, AI systems that collaborate with human experts can enable a
symbiosis between AI and humans to harness the advantages of both and
achieve performance that surpasses that of AI or human experts
alone]{.underline}. For example, a
recent [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31714194/) found that
AI-assisted experts surpassed both humans and AI alone when detecting
malignancies on chest radiographs. The usefulness of human-AI
collaboration will likely depend on specific tasks and clinical
scenarios.

### Extension -- vaccine development 

#### AI can be used to rapidly develop vaccines -- COVID vaccine development proves

Internet-related services and products and artificial intelligence,

1\. AI and vaccine development The trend---and why it matters. [It
typically takes years]{.underline}, if not decades, [to develop a new
vaccine]{.underline}. But by March 2020, vaccine candidates to fight
covid-19 were already undergoing human tests, just three months after
the first reported cases. [The]{.underline} record [speed]{.underline}
of vaccine development [was partly thanks to AI]{.underline} [models
that helped researchers analyze vast amounts of data about
coronavirus.]{.underline} There are tens of thousands of subcomponents
to the outer proteins of a virus[. Machine learning models can sort
through this blizzard of data and predict which subcomponents are the
most immunogenic]{.underline}---i.e., capable of producing an immune
response---and thereby [guide]{.underline} researchers in designing
[targeted vaccines]{.underline}. The use of [AI in vaccine
development]{.underline} may [revolutionize the way all vaccines are
created in the future.]{.underline} Baidu's innovations. In February,
Baidu opened its LinearFold AI algorithm for scientific and medical
teams working to fight the virus. LinearFold predicts the secondary
structure of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence of a virus---and does
so significantly faster than traditional RNA folding algorithms.
LinearFold was able to predict the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2
RNA sequence in only 27 seconds, 120 times faster than other methods.
[This is significant, because the key breakthrough of covid-19 vaccines
has been the development of messenger RNA]{.underline} (mRNA)
[vaccines.]{.underline} Instead of conventional approaches, which insert
a small portion of a virus to trigger a human immune response, mRNA
teaches cells how to make a protein that can prompt an immune response,
which greatly shortens the time span involved in development and
approval. To support mRNA vaccine development, [Baidu later developed
and released an AI algorithm for optimizing mRNA sequence design called
LinearDesign]{.underline}, which aims to solve the problem of unstable
and unproductive mRNA sequences in candidate vaccines. In addition to
opening up access to LinearFold and LinearDesign for researchers around
the world, Baidu also formed a strategic partnership with the National
Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, part of the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Following an outbreak at
Beijing's Xinfadi market in June, [Baidu's AI technology allowed
authorities to complete genome sequencing of the coronavirus strain
within 10 hours, helping curb the outbreak.]{.underline} In December,
Baidu unveiled PaddleHelix, a machine learning-based bio-computing
framework aimed at facilitating the development of vaccine design, drug
discovery, and precision medicine.

### Extension - AI -- lung cancer

#### AI good for lung cancer innovations -- different algorithms offer unique learning abilities to solve this disease 

**Chiu, 22**

\[Hwa- Yen, doctor in the department of chest medicine at the Taipei
General Hospital, \"Application of Artificial Intelligence in Lung
Cancer\", MDPI, Vol. 14, Issue 6, 2022, ProQuest, accessed 7/6/22,
GDI-cc\]

In the 21st century, [human life]{.underline} has been largely
[integrated with AI,]{.underline} and this trend [also extends to the
medical field. The heterogeneity of lung cancer makes it the best field
for AI application]{.underline}. A large number of studies have reported
the application in lung nodule detection, diagnostic application in
histopathology, disease risk stratification, drug development, and even
prognosis prediction. [In this article, we present a narrative review
of AI applications in lung cancer by introducing AI models first and
then reported applications according to the clinical workflow:
screening, diagnosis, decision making, and prognosis
prediction.]{.underline} Table 1 listed the potential AI application
fields in lung cancer.

2. AI Models

[Numerous AI models are constructed with different algorithms are
published]{.underline} nowadays. Generally, the AI models can be divided
into: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised
learning \[9\], and reinforcement learning (Figure 2).

2.1. Supervised Learning

[In supervised learning, researchers need to prepare the labeled dataset
with both inputs and desired outputs]{.underline} (answers[) to train
the algorithm. It is suitable to solve prediction problems, such as
classification and regression.]{.underline} The architecture of the
algorithms varies. Researchers can use multiple binary nodes to create
DTs as a classifier, or find a plane in a multidimensional space as a
SVM classifier. Bayesian classifiers used input data to calculate the
probability of correct classification. With the probability calculated
from the above-mentioned algorithm, researchers can turn the answer into
a continuous variable to solve regression problems and vice versa.
Most AI applications predicting survival \[13,59\], cancer risk
\[34,35,36,37,38,39\], nodule detection \[22,23\], and nodule
characteristics \[33\] are based on supervised learning.

2.2. Unsupervised Learning

[In unsupervised learning, the algorithm divides the samples according
to the inputs by itself. Labeled data are not necessary. It is suitable
to do clustering, to find associations between samples, and to do
dimensionality reduction. For example, cluster analysis was used to find
oncogenes in lung cancer]{.underline} \[67,68\].

2.3. Semi-Supervised Learning

[Though supervised learning provides a more accurate
algorithm]{.underline}, the labeled data are relatively rare, and the
labeling process is labor intensive. Unsupervised learning can adopt
unlabeled data but the algorithm is less accurate. Therefore,
[semi-supervised learning could have both of the advantages when using
supervised learning to generate a labeling tool and use supervised
learning to generate a large scaled labeled dataset for further
training]{.underline} \[52\].

2.4. Reinforcement Learning

[Reinforcement learning is a reward-based system]{.underline}. The
algorithm evolves as it interacts with the environment (dataset). A
reward function is used to adjust the algorithm or the network. This
type of AI is famous for playing chess, shogi, and Go through self-play
\[69\] or generating data with GANs \[70\]. [With this technique,
researchers can develop a self-evolving AI for nodule hunting on CT
images and achieve better accuracy]{.underline} \[15,71,72\].

## AI Good -- Manufacturing 

### 1nc/2ac

#### AI good for manufacturing -- data processing allows for multiple significant improvements and maintenance

[Using AI in a manufacturing context means using data to make actionable
decisions faster and more accurately than a human can do]{.underline}.
There are two specific areas where [this makes]{.underline} a lot of
[sense: for forecasting and for understanding anomalies or
outliers]{.underline}. [There are parts of the manufacturing process
where forecasting can drive value.]{.underline} If you have enough
historic data and context about the decisions and process around the
data, there's a good chance that you can develop
predictions[.]{.underline} Why do the same inputs on the same machines
sometimes have different outcomes? Is there an occasional manufacturing
scenario that you want to understand? [The data off one machine can be
overwhelming to a human analyst, so that's where AI can
help]{.underline}. In addition, [manufacturing systems are holistic and
one metric in part of the process relates to another part of the same
process]{.underline}. If you're only looking at one area, how do you
know what's going on in another? [AI can be the solution]{.underline}.

[There are five areas where AI creates a significant financial
impact]{.underline}.

[1. Predictive maintenance]{.underline}. By taking historic data from
maintenance logs, you can predict how a machine will behave under a
future payload, whether you'll need to fix it, when, why and how --
based on what fixed that problem in the past. [This can reduce downtime
significantly]{.underline}.

[2. Predictive quality]{.underline}. Predicting and reducing failures
[can yield significant cost savings]{.underline}.

[3. Scrap reduction.]{.underline} Using metrics to predict behavior
across product specifications [can minimize scrap and maximize product
quality]{.underline}.

[4. Increasing yield/thruput]{.underline}. Predicting if and when a
machine or process will no longer meet given specifications enables you
to proactively do what's needed to bring it back into specification,
reducing quality passes.

[5. Demand and inventory forecasting]{.underline}. With a thorough
understanding of plant operations and the data behind production, [it's
possible to forecast the demand and movement of critical parts,
resulting in significant inventory savings.]{.underline}

[Manufacturers face increasingly unpredictable demand]{.underline},
rising consumer expectations [and a significant labor
shortage]{.underline}. [The rise of Industry 4.0 technology is helping
companies navigate these challenges by improving product quality and
streamlining factory workflows]{.underline}. [Artificial intelligence
and robots are helping to improve quality and efficiency in
manufacturing.]{.underline} This is how AI and robotics are transforming
the sector right now. These technologies are likely to have a long-term
impact. AI-ENABLED PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS HELP IMPROVE MANUFACTURING
QUALITY AND STREAMLINE MAINTENANCE [The pattern-finding abilities
of]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline}) [make it a
good tool for manufacturers wanting to more effectively navigate
existing market conditions and boost productivity. Artificial
intelligence is primarily used to improve maintenance operations by
reducing downtime and enabling more flexible manufacturing
workflows]{.underline}.

### Extension Predictive maintenance 

#### AI systems lower costs and downtime of machines, results in increased productivity

**Rapp, writer/editor for NIST\'s Manufacturing Extension Partnership,
2022**

\[Katie, "Artificial Intelligence in Manufacturing: Real World Success
Stories and Lessons Learned", NIST, January 7, 2022,
<https://www.nist.gov/blogs/manufacturing-innovation-blog/artificial-intelligence-manufacturing-real-world-success-stories>,
accessed July 6, 2022, GDI-LL\]

These [AI systems are typically enabled by another Industry 4.0
technology]{.underline}, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. They connect
to the internet to continuously send and receive data on machine
performance. [In addition to providing managers with a real-time picture
of equipment health and operation, they also provide the information
needed for a predictive maintenance scheme]{.underline}.

These sensors can track a wide range of operational parameters and
variables, including temperature, vibration, ultrasonic sound and even
lubrication. [This enables the AI system to uncover subtle correlations
between operations and machine failure, helping businesses see
mechanical issues coming before they become obvious.]{.underline}

[These AI systems can also take advantage of quality and product
information]{.underline}, [allowing them to draw connections between
manufacturing errors and operational parameters]{.underline}. In
practice, this could enable a business to automatically detect operating
conditions --- like too-high temperatures or extreme vibration --- that
could be causing defects.

[Key benefits of predictive maintenance systems include lower
maintenance costs, increased machine life span and lower downtime. All
this can reduce overall operating costs and boost site
productivity.]{.underline}

Research from McKinsey suggests that a [predictive maintenance scheme
can save businesses 18%-25% on costs and increase production line
availability by as much as 15%.]{.underline}

[Savings for businesses that currently rely on reactive maintenance will
be much higher]{.underline} than establishments with a preventive
maintenance scheme in place.

NEW ROBOTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY

[Robots are making existing processes more efficient]{.underline}. Some
of the novel versions fill a similar niche as existing robotics,
[automating package filling and sorting tasks and helping to reduce
overall labor needs.]{.underline}

[Many manufacturing robots also take advantage of AI and the cloud to
support workers directly involved in manufacturing. These machines do
not replace workers but instead help them to work more productively or
manage tasks that may be tedious or repetitive.]{.underline}

AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS CAN IMPROVE MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY

[Artificial intelligence has enabled highly autonomous robots. They
can]{.underline} pilot themselves around environments like factories and
[perform some tasks entirely on their own, with no need for human
oversight.]{.underline}

[Examples of these robots include autonomous mobile robots]{.underline}
(AMRs), [commonly used in warehouses to move goods and raw
materials]{.underline} around the facility. They are equipped with
cameras, sensors and a direct connection to the cloud that allows them
to use AI to navigate around obstacles and workers without a pilot.
[Built-in safety features like wireless e-stopping ensure the robots can
work safely near workers on the factory floor]{.underline}.

Like many modern robots, [they can typically be quickly programmed or
reprogrammed, meaning they can change functions depending on current
market conditions and manufacturing needs.]{.underline}

[These robots can help manufacturers increase productivity when hiring
additional workers isn't possible or practica]{.underline}l. In the
future, they may also enable lights-out factories, where the only
employees are technicians and managers who repair robots, coordinate
activities and make production decisions.

COLLABORATIVE ROBOTS CAN BOOST MANUFACTURING QUALITY

Another [key trend in robotics has been collaborative
robots]{.underline} (cobots). These are robots [built to work safely
with people]{.underline}. [Design features like force limiters, padded
edges and AI-powered machine vision make it possible for cobots to work
with fewer safety risks.]{.underline}

[These robots are used for various manufacturing tasks, including
machine tending, picking and packing, and quality
assurance.]{.underline} Many [cobots]{.underline} are built to handle
multiple tasks or slot easily into and out of manufacturing workflows[,
help]{.underline}ing [companies increase productivity without
sacrificing site flexibility]{.underline}.

[They can help make workers more productive, streamlining tedious tasks
and improving the efficiency of jobs that cannot be fully
automated.]{.underline}

NEW AI AND ROBOTICS TECHNOLOGY CAN STREAMLINE MANUFACTURING QUALITY

Manufacturers face a challenging market. [Tools and technology that help
businesses boost quality or efficiency are invaluable]{.underline} as a
result.

[New AI and robotics innovations can make manufacturing processes much
more efficien]{.underline}t[. Predictive maintenance and collaborative
robotics can significantly improve uptime, reduce maintenance costs and
streamline operations, even when labor or supply shortages make typical
workflows difficult to achieve. This boost in quality can put companies
at a competitive advantage and help them stay ahead in the
market.]{.underline}

"We aren't what we were in the '50s and '60s and '70s," former Secretary
of Defense Ash Carter recently reflected. "In those days, all technology
of consequence for protecting our people, and all technology of any
consequence at all, came from the United States and came from within the
walls of government. Those days are irrevocably lost." To get that
technology now, "I've got to go outside the Pentagon no matter what,"
Carter added. The former Pentagon chief may be overstating the case, but
when it comes to artificial intelligence, there's no doubt that the
private sector is in command. Around the world, nations and their
governments rely on private companies to build their AI software,
furnish their AI talent, and produce the AI advances that underpin
economic and military competitiveness. The United States is no
exception. [With Big Tech's titans and endless machine-learning startups
racing ahead on AI, it's easy to imagine that the public sector has
little to contribute. But the federal government's choices on R&D
policy,]{.underline} immigration, antitrust, [and government contracting
could spell the difference between growth and stagnation for America's
AI industry in the coming years]{.underline}. Meanwhile, as AI booms in
other countries, diplomacy and trade policy can help the United States
and its private sector take greatest advantage of advances abroad, and
protective measures against industrial espionage and unfair competition
can help keep America ahead of its adversaries.

# AI Bad/not so good -- Impact Debate

## AI Bad -- Laundry list 

### 1nc/2ac

#### AI generate multiple adverse consequences 

**Acemoğlu,** Professor of Applied Economics, MIT, **2021**

\[Daron "Dangers of unregulated artificial intelligence" Vox EU November

Artificial intelligence (AI) is often touted as the most exciting
technology of our age, promising to transform our economies, lives, and
capabilities. Some even see AI as making steady progress towards the
development of 'intelligence machines' that will soon surpass human
skills in most areas. [AI has indeed made rapid advances over the last
decade or so, especially owing to the application of modern statistical
and machine learning techniques to huge unstructured data
sets.]{.underline} It has already influenced almost all industries: [AI
algorithms are now used by all online platforms and in industries that
range from manufacturing to health, finance, wholesale, and retail.
Government agencies have also started relying on AI, particularly in the
criminal justice system and in customs and immigration
control.]{.underline}

In a recent paper (Acemoglu 2021), I argue that [current AI technologies
--- especially those based on the currently dominant paradigm relying on
statistical pattern recognition and big data --- are more likely to
generate various adverse social consequences, rather than the promised
gains.]{.underline}

[These harms can be seen in product markets and advertising, in terms of
inequality, wage suppression and job destruction in labour markets, and
in the broader societal effects of AI in the context of social
communication, political discourse, and democracy.]{.underline}

## AI Bad - AI arms racing 

### 1nc/2ac -- AI arms race escalatory war 

#### AI arms race risk triggering accidental war -- that escalates

The accelerating AI arms race [Work to incorporate AI into the military
is already far advanced]{.underline}. For example,
[militaries]{.underline} in the U.S., Russia, China, South Korea, the
United Kingdom, Australia, Israel, Brazil, and Iran are [developing
cybersecurity applications, combat simulations, drone swarms, and other
autonomous weapons]{.underline}. A recently completed ["global
information dominance exercise" by U.S. Northern Command]{.underline}
[pointed]{.underline} to the tremendous [advantages]{.underline} the
Defense Department can achieve by [applying machine learning and
artificial intelligence to all-domain information]{.underline}. The
exercise integrated information from all domains including space,
cyberspace, air, land, sea, and undersea, according to Air Force Gen.
Glen D. VanHerck. Gilman Louie, a commissioner on the NSCAI report, is
quoted in a news article saying: "I think it's a mistake to think of
this as an arms race" --- though he added, "We don't want to be second."
A dangerous pursuit West Point has started training cadets to consider
ethical issues when humans lose some control over the battlefield to
smart machines. Along with the ethical and political issues of an [AI
arms race are the increased risks of triggering an accidental
war]{.underline}. How [might]{.underline} this [happen]{.underline}?
[Any number of ways, from]{.underline} [a misinterpreted drone strike to
autonomous jet fighters with new algorithms.]{.underline} AI systems are
trained on data and reflect the quality of that data along with any
inherent biases and assumptions of those developing the algorithms.
Gartner predicts through 2023, up to [10% of AI training data will be
poisoned by]{.underline} benign or [malicious actors]{.underline}. That
is significant, especially considering the security vulnerability of
critical systems. [When it comes to bias, military applications of AI
are presumably no different, except that the stakes are much
higher]{.underline} than whether an applicant gets a good rate on car
insurance. Writing in War on the Rocks, Rafael Loss and Joseph Johnson
argue that [military deterrence is an "extremely complex" problem ---
one that any AI hampered by a lack of good data will not likely be able
to provide solutions for in the immediate future.]{.underline} How about
assumptions? In 1983, the world's superpowers drew near to accidental
nuclear war, largely because the Soviet Union relied on software to make
predictions that were based on false assumptions. Seemingly this could
happen again, especially as [AI increases the likelihood that humans
would be taken out of decision making]{.underline}. It is an open
question whether the risks of such a mistake are higher or lower with
greater use of AI, but Star Trek had a vision in 1967 for how this could
play out. [The risks of conflict had escalated to such a
degree]{.underline} in a "Taste of Armageddon" [that war was outsourced
to a computer simulation]{.underline} that decided who would perish.
[There is no putting the genie back in the bottle. The AI arms race is
well underway and leading militaries worldwide do not want to be in
second place or worse]{.underline}. Where this will lead is subject to

It's now a given that [countries worldwide are battling for AI
supremacy]{.underline}. To date, most of the public discussion
surrounding this competition has focused on commercial gains flowing
from the technology. But [the AI arms race for military applications is
racing ahead]{.underline} as well, [and]{.underline} concerned
[scientists, academics, and]{.underline} AI [industry leaders have been
sounding the alarm]{.underline}. Compared to existing military
capabilities[, AI-enabled technology can make decisions on the
battlefield with mathematical speed and accuracy and never get
tired.]{.underline} However, countries and organizations developing this
tech are only just beginning to articulate ideas about how ethics will
influence the wars of the near future. Clearly, the development of
[AI-enabled autonomous weapons systems will raise significant risks for
instability and conflict escalation.]{.underline} However, [calls to ban
these weapons are unlikely to succeed.]{.underline} In an era of rising
military tensions and risk, [leading militaries worldwide are moving
ahead with AI-enabled weapons and decision support, seeking leading-edge
battlefield and security applications]{.underline}. The military
potential of these weapons is substantial, but [ethical concerns are
largely being brushed aside]{.underline}. [Already they are in use to
guard ships against small boat attacks, search for terrorists, stand
sentry, and destroy adversary air defenses.]{.underline} For now, [the
AI arms race is a cold war, mostly between the U.S., China, and Russia,
but worries are it will become more than that]{.underline}. Driven by
fear of other countries gaining the upper hand, the world's military
powers have been competing by leveraging AI for years --- dating back at
least to 1983 --- to achieve an advantage in the balance of power. This
continues today. Famously, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the
nation that leads in AI will be the "ruler of the world."

### Uniqueness - Increase military investment 

#### AI investment by militaries seeking operational advantage -- increase funding military AI readiness

How policy lines up behind military AI use According to an article in
Salon, diverse and ideologically-distinct research organizations
including the Center for New American Security (CNAS), the Brookings
Institution, and the Heritage Foundation have argued that [America must
ratchet up spending on AI research and development]{.underline}. A
Foreign Affairs article argues that [nations who fail to embrace leading
technologies for the battlefield will lose their competitive
advantage]{.underline}. Speaking about AI, former U.S. Defense Secretary
Mark Esper said last year, "History informs us that those who are first
to harness once-in-a-generation technologies often have a decisive
advantage on the battlefield for years to come." Indeed, [leading
militaries are investing heavily in AI, motivated by a desire to secure
military operational advantages on the future battlefield]{.underline}.
Civilian oversight committees, as well as militaries, have adopted this
view. Last fall, a U.S. bipartisan congressional report called on the
Defense Department to get more serious about accelerating AI and
autonomous capabilities. Created by Congress, the National Security
Commission on AI ([NSCAI) recently urged an increase in AI R&D funding
over the next few years to ensure the U.S.]{.underline} [is able to
maintain its tactical edge over its adversaries and achieve "military AI
readiness" by 2025]{.underline}. In the future, [warfare will pit
"algorithm against algorithm,"]{.underline} claims the new NSCAI report.
Although militaries have continued to compete using weapon systems
similar to those of the 1980s, the NSCAI report claims: "the [sources of
battlefield advantage will shift from traditional factors]{.underline}
like force size and levels of [armaments to factors like superior data
collection and assimilation, connectivity, computing power, algorithms,
and system security]{.underline}." It is possible that new [AI-enabled
weapons would render conventional forces near obsolete]{.underline},
with rows of decaying Abrams tanks gathering dust in the desert in much
the same way as mothballed World War II ships lie off the coast of San
Francisco. Speaking to reporters recently, Robert O. Work, vice chair of
the NSCAI said of the international AI competition: "We have got ... to
take this competition seriously, and we need to win it."

Artificial intelligence (AI) may still hold the potential to solve some
of the world's most intractable problems and help fulfill the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but [when it comes to risks to
privacy and civil liberties, AI already has been a game changer in favor
of authoritarian states]{.underline}. [AI-enabled tools have
turbocharged every pre-existing form of repression including: mass and
targeted surveillance, censorship, and the spread of
propaganda.]{.underline} Contrary to the original expectation that it
would be impossible for repressive states to control the open internet,
[AI has facilitated a]{.underline} [whole new level of state control
over communications infrastructure and the information
realm]{.underline}. Its [technological advantages include scaled
capacity to scan for forbidden content and filter out dissenting
views.]{.underline} In the other direction --- the production of ideas
--- [autocrats have found new ability to control public narratives and
shape civic discourse with AI-generated and amplified
content]{.underline}. New s[ocial engineering tools, such as China's
social-credit system, mold citizens' motivations and
behaviors]{.underline}. Beyond violating privacy and civil liberties,
these [systems have the potential to destroy]{.underline}, in
significant part, [human agency and human dignity]{.underline}. The
larger threat posed by all these [AI-enabled technologies]{.underline}
is that they [are facilitating the spread of digital authoritarianism:
an]{.underline} encompassing techno-social system and [governance model
that involves control and security for the state as opposed to
liberty]{.underline} and security for citizens. Rather than view the
challenge as a series of discrete apps used for repression, [democracies
should see digital authoritarianism through the lens of system
rivalry]{.underline} and recognize that [they face competition from a
powerful, repressive governance model spreading around the
world.]{.underline} This [model is being propagated through]{.underline}
a variety of means. It certainly includes the [diffusion of
technology]{.underline}, but it also includes the diffusion of [values,
norms, and concepts]{.underline} related to appropriate uses of and
constraints on technology. [The authoritarian model is also spread
through propaganda]{.underline} and economic coercion, sometime referred
to as "sharp power," and even through concerted efforts to influence
tech standard-setting bodies, where repressive potential can be embedded
in tech protocols for the future. These elements generally come as a
package deal. China as Model of Digital Authoritarianism The [starkest
example of digital authoritarianism is China]{.underline}'s version,
which is manifesting global influence on multiple layers. First, [China
has become a role-model of AI-driven domestic repression, with highly
escalated surveillance capacities]{.underline} in their own "smart
cities" and panopticon-level control in regions deemed "security
threats," such as Xinjiang. They have [demonstrated stunningly effective
control over the domestic information realm and the ability to steers
citizens' behavior with powerful incentives built into their social
credit system]{.underline}. China also is advancing development of a
sovereign digital currency that will substantially enhance their
repressive powers at home. Second, [China is exporting these repressive
capacities and normalizing their use around the world.]{.underline}
Through broader economic trade and development initiatives, such as its
Belt and Road and Digital Silk Road, China has built entire
infrastructure systems through which it has gained leverage over fragile
states that will last for decades to come, as well as new sources of
data that can be sucked back to Beijing. Third, [China is shaping debate
in international normative arenas by flooding the zone of multilateral
tech-related diplomacy]{.underline}. Their advocacy has been very
effective within normative bodies like the UN Human Rights Council,
where [China has swayed the majority of delegations to support their
repressive uses of technology]{.underline} in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.
They also have demonstrated an ability to exert influence at tech
standard-setting bodies, like the International Telecommunications
Industry (ITU), where interoperability standards for the future are set.
Their aim has been to push China's preferred protocols as the global
default for Internet of things (IOT) and other emerging technologies.
Fourth, in the global marketplace of idea[s, China is spreading
propaganda about the weakness of democracy, using]{.underline} so-called
"Wolf Warrior" [diplomats who aggressively attack the competence of
democracies]{.underline}, particularly the United States, its only
superpower rival. China has also advanced internet governance concepts
like "cyber sovereignty," which is essentially an updated version of a
long-standing authoritarian position that repression within sovereign,
now cyber borders, should not be criticized by external actors based on
international human rights law and principles. Finally, we cannot ignore
the fact that China's growing global influence started with massive
strategic investment in emerging technology. China recognized very early
that dominance in technology would translate into power across other
realms -- military, economic, geopolitical, normative. [The Chinese
Communist Party publicly committed to win the AI-race against the US by
2030 and has made deep investments in]{.underline} other [emerging
technologies]{.underline}, such as quantum computing. Their current push
to be first in developing a sovereign digital currency is another
manifestation of their sophisticated understanding of the linkage
between technology prominence and global power. The bottom line: The
Chinese government is on a mission to remake the 21st century global
order in its own image and in accordance with its own repressive values.
Democratic governments and stakeholders need to recognize the
existential threat posed by this competing digital authoritarian model.

GENEVA (15 September 2021) [-- UN High Commissioner for Human
Rights]{.underline} Michelle Bachelet on Wednesday [stressed the urgent
need for a moratorium on]{.underline} the sale and use of [artificial
intelligenc]{.underline}e (AI) [systems that pose a serious risk to
human rights]{.underline} until adequate safeguards are put in place.
She also called for AI applications that cannot be used in compliance
with international human rights law to be banned. "Artificial
intelligence can be a force for good, helping societies overcome some of
the great challenges of our times. But [AI technologies can
hav]{.underline}e negative, even [catastrophic, effects if they are used
without sufficient regard to how they affect]{.underline} people's
[human rights]{.underline}," Bachelet said. As part of its work\* on
technology and human rights, the UN Human Rights Office has today
published a report that analyses how [AI -- including profiling,
automated decision-making and other machine-learning technologies --
affects people's right to privacy]{.underline} and other rights,
including the rights to health, education, freedom of movement, freedom
of peaceful assembly and association, and freedom of expression.
"Artificial intelligence now reaches into almost every corner of our
physical and mental lives and even emotional states. AI systems are used
to determine who gets public services, decide who has a chance to be
recruited for a job, and of course they affect what information people
see and can share online," the High Commissioner said. The report looks
at how States and businesses alike have often rushed to incorporate AI
applications, failing to carry out due diligence[.]{.underline} There
have already been numerous cases of people being treated unjustly
because of AI, such as being denied social security benefits because of
faulty AI tools or arrested because of flawed facial recognition. The
report details how [AI systems rely on large data sets, with information
about individuals collected, shared, merged and analysed in multiple and
often opaque ways.]{.underline} The [data]{.underline} used to inform
and guide AI [systems can be faulty, discriminatory, out of date or
irrelevant. Long-term storage of data also poses particular risks, as
data could in the future be exploited in as yet unknown
ways.]{.underline} "Given the rapid and continuous growth of AI, filling
the immense accountability gap in how data is collected, stored, shared
and used is one of the most urgent human rights questions we face,"
Bachelet said. [The inferences, predictions and monitoring performed by
AI tools, including seeking insights into patterns of human behaviour,
also raise serious questions.]{.underline} [The biased datasets relied
on by AI systems can lead to discriminatory decisions, and these risks
are most acute for already marginalized groups]{.underline}. "[The risk
of discrimination linked to AI-driven decisions -- decisions that can
change, define or damage human lives]{.underline} -- is all too real.
This is why there needs to be systematic assessment and monitoring of
the effects of AI systems to identify and mitigate human rights risks,"
Bachelet said. There also needs to be much greater transparency by
companies and States in how they are developing and using AI. "The
complexity of the data environment, algorithms and models underlying the
development and operation of AI systems, as well as [intentional secrecy
of government and private actors are factors undermining meaningful ways
for the public to understand the effects of AI systems on human rights
and society,"]{.underline} the report says. "We cannot afford to
continue playing catch-up regarding AI -- allowing its use with limited
or no boundaries or oversight, and dealing with the almost inevitable
human rights consequences after the fact. The power of AI to serve
people is undeniable, but so is [AI's ability to feed human rights
violations at an enormous scale with virtually no visibility. Action is
needed now to put human rights guardrails on the use of AI,]{.underline}
for the good of all of us," Bachelet stressed.

The implications of AI job automation Just two years ago, the idea of AI
automating jobs like creative roles was the stuff of science fiction or
at least relegated to a few early-adopting businesses. But now[, AI is
becoming table stakes for many businesses]{.underline}. [In other words,
if you're not using AI, you're at a disadvantage. The major reason for
this is that large language model,]{.underline} primarily OpenAI's
GPT-3[, have become much better at understanding natural
language.]{.underline} The examples given so far are just the tip of the
iceberg. [AI is automating jobs away in virtually every sector and
industry]{.underline}. While this might seem like cause for alarm, it's
actually long overdue news. The fact is, [we've been living in a world
where machines have been slowly replacing human workers for centuries.
What's new is the pace of this automation. Machines are now becoming
faster, better, and cheaper than humans at an alarming
rate]{.underline}. As a result, we're seeing a fundamental shift in the
economy where machines are starting to do the creative jobs of human
beings. Amidst the opportunity to automate away jobs, a new wave of
AI-focused startups has emerged, all seeking to cash in on the potential
of AI. This AI gold rush is evidenced by the billions of dollars in
venture funding that has flowed into AI startups in recent months. In
the third quarter of 2021 alone, nearly \$18 billion was invested in AI
companies, a record high. This influx of capital is a sign that
investors believe in the potential of AI, and they are betting that it
will eventually automate away many jobs, generating that value with
machines instead[. In the meantime, we should prepare ourselves for a
future in which AI is quietly eating up the world's
workforce.]{.underline}

decline. [New jobs have been created---including some that pay
wel]{.underline}l for highly educated analytical workers. [Others pay
much lower wages,]{.underline} such as those in the personal services

More broadly, [workers who can complement the new automation, and
perform tasks beyond the abilities of machines, often enjoy rising
compensation. However, workers performing similar tasks, for whom the

This trend is not limited to writing. [AI is]{.underline} also
[automating jobs in customer service, accounting, and a host of other

imperceptible to the customer, who doesn't know if they're speaking to a
biological intelligence or a machine. [The rise of AI-powered customer
service has big implications for the workforce.]{.underline} It's
estimated that 85 percent of customer interactions are already handled
without human interaction[.]{.underline}

AI.]{.underline} [When jobs like these are automated away, the question
is:]{.underline} [Where do the displaced workers go?]{.underline}

workers will be re-employed in other fields]{.underline}. But [it's also
possible that they will become unemployed, and that the economy will
struggle to absorb them.]{.underline} This is driving calls for a
universal basic income, in which the government provides all citizens
with a basic income to live on, to offset job losses due to automation.

This past fall, diplomats from around the globe gathered in Geneva to do
something about killer robots. In a result that surprised nobody, they
failed. The [formal debate over lethal autonomous weapons
systems---machines that can select and fire at targets on their
own]{.underline}---began in earnest about half a decade ago under the
Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the international
community's principal mechanism for banning systems and devices deemed
too hellish for use in war. But despite yearly meetings, the [CCW has
yet to agree what "lethal autonomous weapons" even are, let alone set a
blueprint for how to rein them in.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [the
technology is advancing ferociously]{.underline}; militaries aren't
going to wait for delegates to pin down the exact meaning of slippery
terms such as "meaningful human control" before sending advanced warbots
to battle. To be sure, that's a nightmarish prospect. U.N.
Secretary-General António Guterres, echoing a growing chorus of
governments, think tanks, academics, and technologists, has called such
weapons "politically unacceptable" and "morally repugnant." But this all
overlooks an equally urgent menace**[: autonomous systems that are not
in themselves lethal but rather act as a key accessory to human
violence]{.underline}**. Such tools---let's call them lethality-enabling
autonomous systems---might not sound as frightening as a swarm of
intelligent hunter drones. But they could be terrifying. [At best, they
will make conflict far more unpredictable and less accountable. At
worst, they could facilitate ghoulish atrocities]{.underline}. [Many
such technologies are already in use. Many more are right around the
corner.]{.underline} And because of our singular focus on
headline-grabbing killer robots, they have largely gone ignored.
Militaries and spy services have long been developing and deploying
software for autonomously finding "unknown unknowns"---potential targets
who would have otherwise slipped by unnoticed in the torrent of data
from their growing surveillance arsenals. One particularly spooky strand
of research seeks to build algorithms that tip human analysts off to
such targets by singling out cars driving suspiciously around a
surveilled city. [Other lethality-enabling technologies can translate
intercepted communications, synthesize intelligence reports, and predict
an adversary's next move]{.underline}---all of which are similarly
crucial steps in the lead-up to a strike. [Even many entry-level
surveillance devices on the market today,]{.underline} such as targeting
cameras, [come with standard features for automated tracking and
detection.]{.underline} For its part, the U.S. Department of Defense,
whose self-imposed rules for autonomous weapons specifically exempt
nonlethal systems, is allowing algorithms dangerously close to the
trigger. [The Army wants to equip tanks with computer vision that
identifies "objects of interest" (translation: potential targets) along
with recommendation algorithms---kind of like Amazon's---that advise
weapons operators whether to destroy those objects with a cannon or a
gun, or by calling in an airstrik]{.underline}e[**. All of these
technologies fall outside the scope of the international debate on
killer robots. But their effects could be just as
dangerous**.\]{.underline}

[The widespread use of sophisticated autonomous aids in war would be
fraught with unknown unknowns. .An algorithm with the power to suggest
whether a tank should use a small rocket or a fighter jet to take out an
enemy could mark the difference between life and death for anybody who
happens to be in the vicinity of the target]{.underline}. [But different
systems could perform that same calculation with widely diverging
results.]{.underline} [Even the reliability of a single given algorithm
could vary wildly depending on the quality of the data it ingests. It is
also difficult to know whether lethality-enabling artificial
intelligence---prone as computers are to bias---would contravene or
reinforce those human passions that all too often lead to erroneous or
illegal killings]{.underline}. [Nor is there any consensus as to how to
ensure that a human finger on the trigger can be counted on as a
reliable check against the fallibility of its algorithmic
enablers]{.underline}. As such[, in the absence of standards on such
matters]{.underline}, not to mention protocols for algorithmic
accountability, [there is no good way to assess whether a bad
algorithmically enabled killing came down to poor data, human error, or
a deliberate act of aggression against a protected group.]{.underline} A
well-intentioned military actor could be led astray by a deviant
algorithm and not know it; but just as easily, an actor with darker
motives might use algorithms as a convenient veil for an intentionally
insidious decisions[. If one system offers up a faulty conclusion, it
could be easy to catch the mistake before it does any harm. But these
algorithms won't act alone]{.underline}. A few months ago, the U.S. Navy
tested a network of three AI systems, mounted on a satellite and two
different airplanes, that collaboratively found an enemy ship and
decided which vessel in the Navy's fleet was best placed to destroy it,
as well as what missile it should use. The one human involved in this
kill chain was a commanding officer on the chosen destroyer, whose only
job was to give the order to fire. Eventually, the lead-up to a strike
may involve dozens or hundreds of separate algorithms, each with a
different job, passing findings not just to human overseers but also
from machine to machine[. Mistakes could accrue; human judgment and
machine estimations would be impossible to parse from one another; and
the results could be wildly unpredictable. T]{.underline}hese questions
are even more troubling when you consider how central such technologies
will become to all future military operations. [As the technology
proliferates, even morally upstanding militaries may have to rely on
autonomous assistance, in spite of its many risks, just to keep ahead of
their less scrupulous AI-enabled adversaries.]{.underline} [And once an
AI system can navigate complicated circumstances more intelligently than
any team of soldiers, the human will have no choice but to take its
advice on trust]{.underline}---or, as one thoughtful participant at a
recent U.S. Army symposium put it, targeting will become a matter of
simply pressing the "I-believe button." In such a context, assurances
from top brass that their machines will never make the ultimate lethal
decision seem a little beside the point. Most distressing of all,
[automation's vast potential to make humans more efficient extends to
the very human act of committing war crimes]{.underline}. In the wrong
hands, a multi-source analytics system could, say, identify every member
of a vulnerable ethnic group. China's Uighur population is already
routinely submitted to exactly this kind of digital despotism; state and
local authorities have deployed facial recognition tools capable of
picking out members of the predominantly Muslim minority in
closed-circuit TV footage, along with myriad other spying tools, to
chart their every move. Imagine what such a technology could achieve in
war. Militaries have long argued that AI will make conflict more
precise. But that argument has a dark flipside[: An algorithm designed
to minimize civilian casualties could just as easily be used to
calculate how civilian harm could be maximized.]{.underline} Governments
must broaden the debate on killer robots to include all algorithmic
links in the kill-chain. They need to consider how to align such systems
to the fundamental laws of war, and model the complex interactions
between disparate lethality-enabling systems so as to avoid nasty
surprises. Finally, [governments must develop inscrutable and
transparent mechanisms to audit algorithms that go bad, as well as those
humans who employ their algorithms badly.]{.underline} This could even
streamline the debate in Geneva, which has largely broken down over
disagreements as to what counts as a true lethal autonomous weapon. The
norm-building process would no longer have to navigate the
intellectually dubious distinction between warfighting AI and AI used by
warfighters. Instead, the same fundamental principles could be applied
equally to those algorithms that do the killing and those that are
adjacent to it. If, on the other hand, the debate among policymakers
remains narrowly focused on "killer robots," these issues will remain
unresolved until it's too late. That would be an unacceptable mistake.

### Extension -- unpredictability 

#### AI lethal autonomous weapons remain unpredictable and risk removing human intervention on conflict escalation

Earlier this month, a high-level, congressionally mandated commission
released its long-awaited recommendations for how the United States
should approach artificial intelligence (AI) for national security. The
recommendations were part of a nearly 800-page report from [the National
Security Commission on AI]{.underline} (NSCAI) that
[advocated]{.underline} for the use of AI but also highlighted important
conclusions on key [risks posed by AI-enabled and autonomous weapons,
particularly the dangers of unintended escalation of
conflict.]{.underline} The [commission identified these risks as
stemming from several factors, including system failures, unknown
interactions between these systems in armed conflict, challenges in
human-machine interaction, as well as an increasing speed of warfare
that reduces the time and space for de-escalatio]{.underline}n. These
same factors also contribute to the inherent unpredictability in
autonomous weapons, whether AI-enabled or not. From a humanitarian and
legal perspective, the NSCAI could have explored in more depth the risks
such unpredictability poses to civilians in conflict zones and to
international law. [Autonomous]{.underline} weapons are generally
understood, including by the United States and the ICRC, [as those that
select and strike targets without human intervention;]{.underline} in
other words, they fire themselves. This means the [user of an autonomous
weapon does not choose a specific target and so they do not know exactly
where (or when) a strike will occur, or even specifically who (or what)
will be killed]{.underline}, injured or destroyed. AI-enabled autonomous
weapons --- particularly those that would "learn" what to target ---
complicate matters even further[. Developers may not be able to predict,
understand, or explain what happens within the machine learning "black
box."]{.underline} So how would users of the weapon verify how it will
function in practice, or assess when it might not function as intended?
This challenge is not unique to the United States or the types of
technologies it is pursuing. It is a challenge fundamental to the
international debate on AI-enabled and autonomous weapons. From a
humanitarian perspective[, the potential risks that autonomous weapons
pose to civilians and civilian infrastructure in an armed conflict
setting become quite stark when one considers that autonomous targeting
functions could be a feature of]{.underline} (m)any of the expanding
array of [highly mobile armed drones]{.underline} -- in the air, on
land, or at sea. There are also serious legal issues to consider.
[Humans]{.underline}---not machines---[must apply the rules of
international humanitarian law]{.underline} (IHL, also known as the law
of war or the law of armed conflict) [and make context-specific
judgements in attacks to minimize risks for civilians and civilian
objects. The unpredictability of autonomous weapons undermines this
decision-making process at worst and complicates it at best, including
by potentially speeding up the process beyond human
control]{.underline}. The NSCAI recommends that the United States
excludes the use of autonomous nuclear weapons. Almost everyone agrees
on this, but the question remains: What other constraints on autonomous
weapons are needed to address humanitarian, legal, and ethical concerns?
Finding these answers is becoming urgent as autonomous weapons are being
rapidly developed and militaries are seeking to deploy them in armed
conflicts. The commission itself points out the need for greater
constraints, and heightened levels of human control in environments
where more civilians are present -- such as in urban areas. The ICRC,
including in a recent report with the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, has made some additional suggestions (submitted
during the NSCAI's consultations). Essentially, [strict limits are
needed on the types of autonomous weapons and the situations they are
used in]{.underline}, as well as requirements for humans to supervise,
intervene, and be able to switch them off. Some of these limits are
borne of fundamental ethical concerns for humanity (and not only law).
[Public opinion surveys suggest most individuals would tend to agree
that an algorithm should not "decide" whether someone lives or
dies]{.underline}. After all, inanimate objects -- software included --
have no moral (or legal) agency, and over-reliance on algorithms can
interfere with human agency. What this may mean is not that there would
be a "moral imperative" to pursue autonomous weapons to replace human
decision-makers, but rather that [there may be a moral imperative to
exclude autonomous weapons that target humans directly]{.underline}.
This approach has gathered some support among experts with often
opposing views on the risks, and is even reflected in concerns expressed
by a former U.S. defence secretary about the proliferation of autonomous
weapons. The commission also entered the debate on whether an
international agreement, such as a new legally binding treaty, is needed
to address autonomous weapons. It is clearly opposed, citing the
obstacle of overcoming the lack of an internationally agreed definition;
difficulty in verifying compliance; and concerns that U.S. adversaries
would not comply. On the other hand, the NSCAI expressed concerns that
adversaries might interpret existing legal obligations (and ethical
considerations) differently and recommended that the United States
"develop international standards of practice for the development,
testing, and use of AI-enabled and autonomous weapon systems." The ICRC
has, since 2015, called for internationally agreed limits on autonomous
weapons systems---whether new rules, policy standards or best practices;
and developments at the international level are somewhat encouraging in
this respect. There is increasing understanding among States about the
types of international limits on autonomous weapons needed to address
legal and ethical concerns. Such limits would have the dual advantage of
building confidence in mutually agreed legal and ethical
interpretations, while also managing the wider risks of conflict
escalation. These are not problems that are likely to be solved by
national approaches alone. None of the ICRC's suggested limits would
prevent countries from using AI to the extent it can support human
decision-making in warfare that better complies with IHL and minimizes
risks for civilians. But the unconstrained development and use of
autonomous weapons pulls in the wrong direction for legal compliance and
civilian protection

## AI Bad - policing 

#### AI policing replicates bias and reinforces inequality, without accountability 

**Reece 22 **

(Hope Reece, a journalist who writes for The New York Times, The
Atlantic, Vox, and other publications, "What Happens When Police Use AI
to Predict and Prevent Crime?" JSTOR Daily, February 23rd 2022,
https://daily.jstor.org/what-happens-when-police-use-ai-to-predict-and-prevent-crime/,
accessed 7/6/22, GDI- TMK)

Bias in law enforcement has long been a problem in America. The killing
of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by Minneapolis police officers in
May 2020 most recently brought attention to this fact---sparking waves
of protest across the country, and highlighting the ways in which those
who are meant to "serve and protect" us do not serve all members of
society equally. [With]{.underline} the dawn of [artificial
intelligence]{.underline} (AI), [a slew of new machine learning tools
promise to help protect us]{.underline}---quickly and precisely
[tracking those who may commit a crime before it happens---through
dat]{.underline}a[. Past information about crime can be used as material
for machine learning algorithms to make predictions about future crimes,
and police departments are allocating resources towards prevention based
on these predictions]{.underline}. The tools themselves, however,
present a problem: [The data being used to "teach" the software systems
is embedded with bias, and only serves to reinforce
inequality]{.underline}. Here's how: Black people are more likely than
white people to be reported for a crime---whether the reporter is white
or Black. This leads to [Black neighborhoods being marked as "high risk"
at a disproportionate rate]{.underline}. Using data as a tool for
policing is not new---it's been going on since the 1990s, in an effort
to help departments decide which communities are at "high risk." If they
know where the most crime happens, the thinking went, police could put
more resources into policing a given area. However[, the logic is
faulty: If more police are dispatched to a certain neighborhood, it
clearly follows that "more" crime will appear here]{.underline}.
Essentially[, it's a feedback loop, which provides a skewed version of
where crime is actually taking place]{.underline}. (Another issue at
hand is the allocation of police resources rather than social services.
There is much debate, for instance, about whether the role of police in
certain poor, Black neighborhoods also tends to create a "police state"
environment, in which citizens do not feel safe, and there are strong
arguments that more funding for mental health or other social services
would better serve these communities). [When machine learning algorithms
are fed this "data" to train their predictive systems, they replicate
this bias, reinforcing false ideas about which neighborhoods are more
"high risk."]{.underline} [Another problem]{.underline} with the
thinking [is that it relies on past information. While our past may give
us a clue into future behavior, it does not take into consideration the
concept of]{.underline} and potential [for rehabilitation, and has the
effect of reinforcing negative views, and continuing to punish those who
have already paid their debt]{.underline}. Police departments across the
globe are using these software programs to pinpoint crime. While there
are dozens of American tech companies selling this type of software to
law enforcement agencies, one particular startup, Voyager Labs, is
collecting social media information---including Facebook posts, emojis,
friends--and analyzing them to make connections, even cross-referencing
this information with private data, to create a "holistic" profile that
can be used to find people who pose "risks." Inaccuracy and Bias
Embedded in AI Systems [Automated-policing approaches are often
inaccurate]{.underline}. A 2018 trial conducted by the London
Metropolitan Police used facial recognition to identify 104 previously
unknown people who were suspected of committing crimes. Only 2 of the
104 were accurate. "From the [moment a police officer wrongly identifies
a suspect]{.underline} until the moment the officer realizes their
error, [significant coercive action can take place:]{.underline} the
suspect can be arrested, brought to a police station and detained. It
[can be terrifying, with irreversible consequences, including human
rights violations,]{.underline}" Edward Santow writes in The Australian
Quarterly. Additionally, [facial recognition systems have also
demonstrated bias against people of color.]{.underline} In an egregious
example, [Facebook's facial recognition algorithm labeled Black people
"primates]{.underline}"---which it recently told the BBC "was clearly an
unacceptable error." Lack of Human Oversight in Automated Processes
Automated systems remove human oversight. As law enforcement agencies
increasingly rely on these deep learning tools, the [tools themselves
take on an authority, and their predictions are often unquestioned. This
has resulted in]{.underline} what Kate Crawford and Jason Schultz, in
their report "AI Systems as State Actors" call [an "accountability
gap]{.underline}," which "[may result in both state and
privat]{.underline}e human [employees having less]{.underline} knowledge
or direct [involvement in the specific decisions that cause
harm."]{.underline} The tools themselves could come from various
sources---created "in-house" by government agencies, developed by
contractors, or even donated, Crawford and Schultz point out. And with
these various configurations, there is little information on who should
be accountable when the systems fail. A new project by Columbia
University, in tandem with the AI Now Institute and the New York
University School of Law's Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law, and
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, was recently begun "to conduct an
examination of current United States courtroom litigation where the use
of algorithms by government was central to the rights and liberties at
issue in the case." In this report, the researchers focused on cases in
which AI is currently being used in law enforcement: in the areas of
Medicaid and disability benefits, public teacher evaluations, and
criminal risk assessments. In these cases, the researchers looked at how
the AI systems were used by humans. The authors concluded: These [AI
systems were implemented without meaningful training, support, or
oversight, and without any specific protections for
recipients]{.underline}. This was due in part to the fact that they were
adopted to produce cost savings and standardization under a monolithic
technology-procurement model, which rarely takes constitutional
liability concerns into account[. The focus of the algorithms were
biased---in an effort to cut budgets, they targeted those who would be
more likely to need support]{.underline}. "Thus, an algorithmic system
itself, optimized to cut costs without consideration of legal or policy
concerns, created the core constitutional problems that ultimately
decided the lawsuits." Like "traveling sales representatives," the
authors remarked, these [automated tools would take information from one
location to another, applying it to new populations, increasing the
potential for bias to skew the results]{.underline}. "As AI systems rely
more on deep learning, potentially becoming more autonomous and
inscrutable, the accountability gap for constitutional violations
threatens to become broader and deeper." This raises the question: How
should we hold the software companies themselves accountable? When
automated systems are given free rein, and human oversight becomes
obsolete, should tech companies assume responsibility for how their
products are used? The law is still unclear on this issue. "When
challenged, many state governments have disclaimed any knowledge or
ability to understand, explain, or remedy problems created by AI systems
that they have procured from third parties," Crawford and Schultz argue.
"The general position has been "we cannot be responsible for something
we don't understand." This means that [algorithmic systems are
contributing to the process of government decision making without any
mechanisms of accountability or liability]{.underline}." A failure to
address this accountability gap should mean a halt in the use of these
tools

Timea Nagy wishes these tools had been available when she was

quick money in Canada. She thought she'd be working as a nanny, or at

forced into sex work and erotic dancing. Nagy only escaped by finding a
couple of people in the club and pointing to words like "scared" and
"help" in her Hungarian-English dictionary.Two of her perpetrators were
never caught and now, 21 years later, she still has nightmares about
running from them. By day she fights back, however, and her many years
of activism include advising Traffic Jam and now working with

the power of A.I.: technology is only as good as the people who use
it.]{.underline} "I think artificial intelligence is fantastic," she
adds. "[The new software is fantastic. But if it gets into the wrong

remark coming from the co-founder of a nonprofit, AnnieCannons, whose

that providing a solid path to legal employment changes the calculus
more than busting traffickers, which too often leaves victims out on the
streets vulnerable to the next predator. AnnieCannons graduates not only
get good jobs, but they are also designing tech solutions they'd like to
see, including a mobile app to help with restraining orders and a
platform to crowdsource anonymous sexual assault reports.

current geopolitical storm. Many biotech players have signed a pledge to
halt business activities with Russian companies and investors. According
to Paule, biotech companies can help the situation in Ukraine by
focusing on how to use their contacts and resources to bring medical
supplies to those in need, in addition to providing work to Ukrainians

biotechnology companies that produced the start of the biotechnology

often have led to spin-out biotech companies. Success of the science and
business of biotechnology in biopharma can be measured by the number and
the variety of products, many indications with disease mitigations,
companies (biotech and pharmaceutical), research & development, and
product sales.]{.underline} In overview, biotechnology has demonstrated
a substantial crescendo pattern of growth; first, with 518 products
being marketed world-wide in United States (USA), Europe and Japan by

#### New biotech regulations remove some regulations for biotech

With these goals of the 1992 CF Update, the 2017 Modernization of the
CF, and Executive Order 13874 in mind, [USDA recently revised its
biotechnology regulations]{.underline}, [now called the
SECURE]{.underline} (Sustainable, Ecological, Consistent, Uniform,
Responsible, Efficient) rule (15). The SECURE rule (15)

1\)

establishes exemptions for plants modified by genetic engineering
techniques where the modification could otherwise be achieved through
conventional breeding techniques, ensuring that such plants are treated
similarly to conventionally bred plants from a regulatory perspective,
consistent with Scope principle 1 from the 1992 CF Update;

2\)

uses a risk-based approach to determine whether an organism is
regulated, rather than relying on whether the organism was developed
using a plant pest consistent with Scope principle 2 in the 1992 CF
Update; and

3\)

provides a mechanism for a rapid initial review to efficiently
distinguish plants developed using genetic engineering that do not pose
plausible pathways to increased plant pest risk from those that do and
thus require further evaluation, consistent with Scope principle 2 in
the 1992 CF Update.

[In contrast, under the former regulations the determination to regulate
was based on whether a plant pest or plant pest sequence was used in the
engineering process]{.underline}. USDA did not evaluate the risk posed
by the modified plant or conduct a risk assessment of the product until
a petition was submitted by a developer several years after the plant
was subject to USDA oversight, thereby resulting in a substantial
regulatory burden from the outset. The plant pest trigger provided a
means of capturing most organisms developed using genetic engineering
under the regulation because Agrobacterium (a plant pest) was used as a
vector, or regulatory sequences from Agrobacterium or plant viruses were
commonly used in genetic engineering. Over time the agency has learned
that the presence of plant pest sequences or the use of a plant pest
vector to modify a plant is unrelated to the properties (and risk) of
the plant. Conversely, the plant pest trigger did not capture plants
transformed by biolistics and with DNA lacking plant pest sequences.
Thus, [the plant pest trigger created a situation where many lower-risk
plants developed using a plant pest were subject to regulation, while
potentially higher-risk plants created without using a plant pest were
not. By further harmonizing with the 1992 and 2017 CF Updates, the
SECURE rule will provide more appropriate risk-based oversight of plants
and other organisms developed using genetic engineering
techniques.]{.underline} This is expected to reduce regulatory barriers,
reduce regulatory costs, and stimulate innovation.

many large drug companies from antibiotic development. Yet these smaller

bankruptcies and cutbacks that further shrink the pool of new

\*MCM = medical countermeasures

[The emergence of new biotechnologies provides great promise for
biodefense, especially for key objectives of biosurveillance and early
warning, microbial forensics, risk and threat assessment, horizon
scanning in biotechnology, and MCM development, scale-up, and
delivery.]{.underline} Understanding and leveraging newly-developed
capabilities afforded by emerging biotechnologies require knowledge
about cutting-edge research and its real or proposed application(s) to
analogous needs[, the process through which biotechnologies
advance]{.underline}, and the educational and research infrastructure
that promotes multi-disciplinary science. [When combined with knowledge
about biodefense gaps that could be addressed through science and
technology, creative scientists, engineers, and decision-makers can
design research agendas or concepts based on the identified gaps and S&T
needs, and that leverage emerging biotechnologies]{.underline}.
Innovation in research and technology development are driven by
sector-specific needs and the convergence of the physical, chemical,
material, computer, engineering, and life sciences. [Biotechnologies
developed for other sectors could be applied to biodefense, especially
if the individuals involved are able to innovate in concept design and
development. Of all biodefense objectives, biosurveillance seems to have
reaped the most benefit from emerging biotechnologies, specifically the
integration and analysis of diverse clinical, biological, demographic,
and other relevant data.]{.underline} More recently, scientists have
begun applying synthetic biology, genomics, and microfluidics to
development of new products and platforms for MCMs. Unlike these
initiatives, investments in microbial forensics have been few, limiting
its ability to leverage biotechnology advances for collecting and
analyzing data. Looking to the future, emerging biotechnologies can
provide new opportunities for enhancing biodefense by addressing
capability gaps.

#### B -- Risk of bioterrorism growing due to technological advances---mass death without a cure and biodefense

[Technological progress since the Industrial Revolution has ultimately
increased the risk of the most extreme events, putting humanity's future
at stake through nuclear war or climate breakdown]{.underline}. One
technology that may pose the greatest threat this century is artificial
intelligence (AI) -- not the current crop of narrowly intelligent
networks, but more mature systems with a general intelligence that
surpasses our own. AI pioneers from Alan Turing to Stuart Russell have
argued that unless we develop the means to control such systems or to
align them with our values, we will find ourselves at their mercy.

By my estimation, [the chances of such a risk causing an existential
catastrophe in the next century are about one in six:]{.underline} like
Russian roulette. If I'm even roughly right about the scale of these
threats, then this is an unsustainable level of risk. We cannot survive
many centuries without transforming our resilience.

Th[e government's recent integrated review highlighted]{.underline} the
importance of these "catastrophic-impact threats", paying attention to
four of the most extreme risks; the threats from AI, global pandemics,
the climate crisis and nuclear annihilation. It rightly noted the
crucial role that AI systems will play in modern warfare, but was silent
about the need to ensure that the AI systems we deploy are developed
safely and aligned with human values. It underscored [the likelihood of
a successful biological attack in the coming years]{.underline}, [but
could have said more about the role science and technology can play in
protecting us]{.underline}. And although it mentioned the threat of
other countries increasing and diversifying their nuclear capabilities,
the decision to expand the UK's own nuclear arsenal is both
disappointing and counterproductive.

To really transform our resilience to extreme risks, we need to go
further. First, we must urgently address biosecurity. As well as the
possibility of a new pandemic spilling over from animals, [there is the
even worse prospect of an engineered pandemic]{.underline}, [designed by
foreign states or non-state actors]{.underline}, [with a]{.underline}
combination of [lethality, transmissibility, and vaccine resistance
beyond any natural pathogen]{.underline}. With the rapid improvements in
biotechnology, [the number of parties who could create]{.underline} such
[a weapon is]{.underline} only [growing]{.underline}.

## Extension -- Biodefense

### Biodefense -- vaccine development and advanced warnings

#### Investment in biotech creates biodefense -- produces vaccine development and provides an advanced warning of biothreats through data sharing 

**Berger, 19**

Security Policy at the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, \"Emerging and Enabling Technologies in Biodefense\", National

GDI-cc\]

[Biotechnologies provide critical capabilities in the defense
against]{.underline} natural and man-made [threats.]{.underline} In
health, new scientific discoveries and platforms contribute to the
development of vaccines and medicines against pathogens, such as
influenza A virus or Bacillus anthracis. [Researchers' ability to
understand the relationship between pathogens and their hosts provide
the information needed to create targeted vaccines and
medicines]{.underline}. Similarly, [scientists have begun applying
synthetic biology tools and concepts to vaccine
development,]{.underline} hoping to reduce the time involved in creating
a vaccine against an emerging infectious disease and enabling rapid
response efforts. More recently, investments in additive
[bio-manufacturing have provided new opportunities to print human
tissues and organs,]{.underline} which in some laboratories, are being
[used to study the effects of pharmaceutical candidates]{.underline}
before testing in animals or people. In addition, advances in knowledge
gained from [neuroscience and behavioral sciences provides new
opportunities to understand and identify clinical interventions to
prevent or treat various psychological disorders,]{.underline} such as
post-traumatic stress disorder after return from military conflict.

Beyond health efforts, [governments are looking to the life sciences and
biotechnology to assist in early warning of infectious disease events,
forensics, decontamination of materials, and many other uses. Efforts to
gain advanced warning of infectious disease events have leveraged new
data analysis technologies]{.underline} (e.g., natural language
processing, image analysis, and text analysis) [to evaluate a variety of
information]{.underline}, including environmental, ecological, genomic,
physiological, and other relevant data[. Efforts to promote longevity of
materials and equipment have leveraged advances in synthetic
biology.]{.underline} Efforts to enhance microbial forensics and
attribution have leveraged advances in microbiology and improved data
handing and sharing procedures between public health and law enforcement
communities[. Enabling this research and data sharing was a commitment
by the U.S. government and international organizations to seek solutions
for capability gaps]{.underline} in preventing, detecting, and
responding to natural and/or man-made infectious disease events of
international concern.

### Biodefense - surveillance and data 

#### Biotech produces methods of biodefense to preserve national security -- creates effective surveillance methods and flow of data 

**Berger, 19**

\[Kavita, Associate Director of the Center for Science, Technology, and
Security Policy at the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, \"Emerging and Enabling Technologies in Biodefense\", National

GDI-cc\]

[Despite concerns about how advances in biotechnology could be applied
to harm national security, these advances can enhance efforts to
prevent, prepare for, and respond to incidents involving chemical and
biological threats]{.underline}. For example, next generation sequencers
and data analysis software allow scientists to collect information about
host response following exposures to pathogens or hazardous chemicals,
the microbiome that supports normal growth and functioning of the human
body, the organisms in the environment, and many other molecules
associated with the normal state of the human body and potential risk
factors of exposure to chemical or biological hazards. [These data can
inform surveillance efforts to help determine whether and when a natural
or man-made incident has occurred, aiding both detection of potentially
harmful incidents and forensic analysis. In addition, the data may
inform the development of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tools against
chemical and biological agents]{.underline} \[called medical
countermeasures (MCMs)\]
\[[57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR57)--[61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR61)\].
[Another examples include the use of synthetic genomics, which is the
chemical synthesis of genomic DNA of organisms, as platform methods for
rapid development of vaccines against epidemic pathogens. Synthetic
biology is being used to create technology platforms for rapid MCM
development against pathogens and for synthesis of pharmaceutical
products. Similar technologies can be used to prevent, detect, and
respond to incidents involving contamination]{.underline} or infection
of animals and agriculturally-important plants. In addition, synthetic
biology is being used to develop biological systems that "eat" nerve
agent
\[[62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR62), [63](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR63)\],
clean up contaminated materials
\[[61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR61)\],
and exert biocontrol in the environment
\[[64](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR64), [65](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR65)\].
[These efforts are being aided by advances in genome editing, laboratory
automation, high-throughput experimental procedures, bioinformatics, and
other technologies that improve repeatability and reduce human error
during experimentation.]{.underline}

### Biodefense -- MCM development

#### Application of biotech into MCM development creates effective biodefense -- furthers scientific knowledge of threats and develops defense against pathogens

Security Policy at the American Association for the Advancement of

GDI-cc\]

\*\*MCM = medical countermeasure

Although the operational considerations for the MCM needs for the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and DoD differ, the early
research and development studies do not differ dramatically by
product end-use. Therefore, [the relevant HHS and DoD offices
established the Integrated Portfolio, poviding opportunities to
co-manage investments in MCM research and development of common
interest]{.underline}
\[[72](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR72), [75](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR75)\].

[These programs provide the structure within which new scientific
research and technologies can be funded and leveraged for medical
countermeasure development. Through a combination of funding programs
and technology watch efforts, program managers support innovation in
technology development and learn about existing biotechnologies that
could be applied to MCM development. For example, the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has created several programs to
generate the scientific knowledge needed to detect human infection from
any pathogen, develop new technologies to conduct field diagnostics with
little sample, and create platform methodologies for rapid development
of vaccines against outbreak pathogens]{.underline}
\[[76](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR76), [77](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR77)\].
Although the results of this research are expected to enhance military
force protection against biological threats, the scientific discoveries
and technologies may benefit development of MCMs for civilians.

[Recognizing potential funding opportunities for MCM development,
academic and industrial researchers have undertaken efforts to apply new
knowledge and scientific approaches to MCM]{.underline} development. For
example, in 2013, the J. Craig Venter Institute and Novartis described
the rapid creation of influenza vaccines within a cell-free system,
capitalizing on recent innovations in synthetic biology
\[[78](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR78)\].
More recently, [scientists have used synthetic genomics]{.underline}
(i.e., chemically-synthesized genomes) [to generate hard-to-obtain
pathogens]{.underline}, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus
\[[79](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR79), [80](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR80)\],
or to develop candidate vaccine vectors against biological agents such
as the recently-recreated horsepox virus
\[[81](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR81)\].
Still other scientists have conducted studies to develop research
animals and conditions that reflect pathogen infection and onset of
disease in humans
\[[70](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR70), [82](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR82)\]
or alternative approaches for studying product efficacy, such as the
"human on a chip"
\[[83](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123622/#CR83)\].

[Tools of agricultural biotechnology include modern breeding techniques,
genetic engineering and genome editing]{.underline}. They may offer
diverse, [science-driven approaches to simultaneously alleviate the
accelerating pace of both climate change and global food
insecurity]{.underline}, while building on decades of using these
products safely. [Farmers can adopt an integrated set of
tools]{.underline}, including biotech crops, [that are climate resilient
and can better withstand various stresses, including drought, heat and
flooding]{.underline}. In addition, researchers are designing many
traits with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving
water and land, while increasing yields (Figure 1). Ultimately, it is
not enough to have good products that work. Country regulatory
environments that allow these products to come to the market and public
acceptance are also essential to our efforts in Feed the Future.

[Agriculture is practiced in approximately 40 percent of the world's
landmass. By replacing natural ecosystems, it has become the largest
terrestrial biome on our planet.]{.underline} Most of the land used to
produce crops (\~96 percent) is farmed using conventional methods but
this trend is shifting. Since the first genetically modified (GM) plants
--- antibiotic resistant tobacco and petunia --- were successfully
created in the 1980s, [GM/biotech crops have been the fastest adopted
crop technology in the history of modern agriculture.]{.underline}

How GM crops benefit biodiversity

After so many years of production, there is ample scientific literature
that demonstrates how [GM crops have had a positive impact on
biodiversity]{.underline}. Some include:

PROTECTING FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY

There is a substantial body of literature addressing the potential
beneficial impacts of GM crops on the environment in the context of
farmland diversity. [GM crops preserve varietal diversity in many
crops.]{.underline} For example[, they can be engineered to resist
insect pests, reducing the use of synthetic insecticides and resulting
in higher insect biodiversity on farms when compared to planting similar
conventional varieties and using synthetic insecticides]{.underline}.

REDUCING PESTICIDE USE

Modern biotechnology can help [protect the environment from pesticide
use.]{.underline} [GM crops that are resistant to pests have
significantly contributed to the reduction of insecticide
sprays]{.underline} around the world. It is estimated [insect-resistant
crops reduced global pesticide use by 37 percent.]{.underline}

[REDUCING TOXIC LEVELS IN HERBICIDE USE]{.underline}

Many GM crops produced through modern biotechnology have helped
[decrease the use of herbicides with acute (or short-term) toxicity and
chronic (or long-term) toxicity]{.underline}.

[DECREASING CO2 EMISSIONS]{.underline}

The [use of some GM crops contributed to tens of millions of acres
transitioning to zero-tillage]{.underline}. The reduction in tillage has
produced a significant environmental benefit, resulting in 2.4 billion
kg fewer carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, the adoption of GM
technology in corn, soybean and cotton reduced agricultural land and
input use, saving 0.15 Gt of GHG emissions, [equivalent to roughly
one-eighth the emissions from automobiles in the US.]{.underline}

[AVOIDING FARMLAND EXPANSION]{.underline}

Modern [biotechnology]{.underline} can help [produce more with less
land. Higher yields on cultivated land could reduce the need for
additional cropland expansion, thus preserving natural
biodiversity]{.underline}. Without the productivity gains from GMOs
during recent years, around 25 million hectares of additional farmland
would have to be cultivated globally, in order to maintain current
agricultural production levels. Farmland expansion is an important
contributing factor to biodiversity loss and climate change.

ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE

[GM crops currently under development have produced evidence that if
adopted they could contribute to climate change mitigation and
adaptation]{.underline}. Drought-tolerant maize varieties have been
reported to perform better than conventional varieties across several
countries in eastern and southern Africa. Moreover, [GM crops have been
proposed as an important part of an integrated strategy to mitigate the
effects of climate change]{.underline}, such as drought and potential
damage of fall armyworm in Africa.

#### B - Pollution, biodiversity loss and anthropogenic climate change, are an existential threat and are rapidly accelerating

[Welcome to]{.underline} the age of humans\--[the
Anthropocene]{.underline}. Scientists, academics, public intellectuals,
and policymakers have been using this term to describe a new geological
epoch marking an unprecedented era of human impact on the natural
environment. [Beginning with the Industrial Revolution]{.underline} in
the late 18th century, [carrying through the development and testing of
nuclear weapons, and peaking in recent decades with rapid global warming
and the catastrophic depletion of the Earth\'s biodiversity, the
Anthropocene is]{.underline} often [framed as an existential threat to
the]{.underline} survival of the [human species]{.underline}. Like some
of the great environmental catastrophes of the past\--such as the mass
extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago\--the
footprint of human activity will be present in the geological record for
millions of years to come. Or so the reasoning goes.

[There is every reason to be alarmed about anthropogenic climate change,
pollution, and biodiversity loss, all of which have been accelerating in
recent decades and do pose existential threats.]{.underline}
[Warming]{.underline} trends [could cause the collapse of Arctic and
Antarctic ice sheets that would]{.underline} dramatically [increase sea
levels by dozens of feet by the end of this century]{.underline}. If
that happens, [say goodbye to N]{.underline}ew [Y]{.underline}ork
[C]{.underline}ity, [San Francisco, Seattle, Mumbai, London, Istanbul,
Dubai, St. Petersburg, Mumbai, and Beijing, to name just some of the
most populous cities that would be drowned.]{.underline} Left unchecked,
[climate change would also involve ocean acidification]{.underline} (as
the oceans absorb atmospheric carbon), [terrible droughts and heat
waves]{.underline} (with equatorial regions reaching unlivable
temperatures for much of the year), [air pollution at unbreathable
levels in many major cities, and mass extinctions of plants and animals
at levels not seen since]{.underline} some of the greatest geological
catastrophes in the Earth\'s history\--perhaps as severe as [the \"great
dying\" at the end of the Permian period]{.underline} some [250 million
years ago]{.underline}, [when]{.underline} as many as [96 percent of all
living species may have died out]{.underline}. [The resulting
Earth]{.underline} from this catastrophe [may become devoid not only of
humans but perhaps of most complex life on land and in the
seas.]{.underline}

invasive species, over-exploitation, pollution and climate change.
[Biodiversity conservation]{.underline} has become a global concern
[requiring a comprehensive and integrated approach]{.underline}. [There
are different methods and strategies to conserve biodiversity, and
biotechnology can play an important role in many of them.]{.underline}

[Some biotechnology]{.underline} related methods can be [applied
directly to species of interest]{.underline}, for example, [through

[Agricultural biotechnology is a crucial tool for transforming global
food systems]{.underline} [to meet]{.underline} the United Nation's goal
of ensuring [zero hunger]{.underline} by 2030, say some scientists,
academics and civil society representatives. Evidence abounds that
[biotechnology has had a positive overall impact on
agriculture]{.underline} in the areas where it has been employed, they
say. If adopted more widely across the globe, it could be instrumental
in meeting the UN's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, which aims to
end world hunger, boost nutrition and support agricultural
sustainability within the next nine years. "[GMO technology is working
for farmers]{.underline}," observed Arif Hossain, CEO of Farming Future
Bangladesh. He cited the [six-fold increase in income that farmers in
Bangladesh have earned as a result of growing]{.underline} Bt eggplant,
an important [food crop genetically modified to resist]{.underline} the
[destructive]{.underline} fruit and shoot borer [pest]{.underline}
without the application of insecticides. More
[opportunities]{.underline} [must be created for farmers to access crop
biotechnology if the world's food systems are to be transformed to meet
the challenge of feeding]{.underline} the more than 811 million [people
who suffer hunger across the globe]{.underline}, he said. "[The
nutritional content and the beneficial element of staple foods like rice
enriched with vitamins and minerals need to be emphasized and allowed to
be grown so smallholder farmers can have access to that,"]{.underline}
Hossain said. "We need to take immediate action and create enabling
environments for people to have access." It is high time for us all to
come forward and allow people to innovate and [use GM technology for
food security and sustainability,]{.underline} he added. Given the
world's high population growth, limited land for agricultural production
and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it will be more challenging to achieve
the SDG on hunger, Hossain said, adding that all options that can help
deal with food insecurity should be explored. Hossain made his comments
during a Food Systems Summit independent dialogue organized by the
Alliance for Science. The dialogue was one of thousands being held
across the world ahead of the UN's extraordinary global Food Systems
Summit in September, where the future of the world's food systems will
be deliberated. The meeting was deemed necessary because the world
currently is not on track to meet the zero-hunger target and other SDGs
by 2030 unless drastic actions are taken. Participants will deliberate
on and launch bold, new actions to help deliver progress on all 17 SDGs,
each of which relies to some degree on the goal of achieving zero
hunger. "[There is a big role ag biotech can play in food systems
transformation, especially]{.underline} the role of ag biotech in value
addition to be able to [get the best out of the crops]{.underline},"
Vitumbiko Chinoko, project manager of the Open Forum on Agricultural
Biotechnology (OFAB), told the dialogue. He urged governments to invest
more in the technology. "I'm looking at a future where we will invest
our own money as African governments into ag biotechnology so we can own
the technology," Chinoko said. Agricultural economist Dr. Graham
Brookes, director of PG Economics in the United Kingdom, told the
dialogue that the adoption of [GM crops]{.underline} between 1996 and
2018 [produced an additional 824 million tonnes of food,]{.underline}
feed and fiber worldwide. He said farmers earned an extra US\$225
billion in income by growing GM crops during that same period, [while
reducing the use of agricultural pesticides]{.underline} by 8.6 percent,
resulting in [a 19 percent cut]{.underline} in associated [environmental
impacts.]{.underline} [The technology also helped reduce carbon
emissions]{.underline} equal to taking 15.3 million cars off the road.
Because GM crops increase yields, if they had not been available during

#### b. Impact - Food insecurity leads to societal collapse---conflict and institutional breakdown, international spillover

Engineering at the University of Bath, and Professor of Engineering and

Walking through the CLD at a high-level, we can see how [population
growth and lifestyle emissions]{.underline}, influenced by
institutional/demographic factors (e.g. emission reduction incen-
tives), combine to directly drive climate change. Similarly, they
[indirectly drive climate change via consumer demand on food production,
which produces emissions directly]{.underline} (e.g. ruminant livestock)
[and indirectly via industrial capital/output]{.underline} (e.g.
processing factories). The environmental risk factors (e.g. extreme
weather events) of climate change may cause losses of food production
either directly (e.g. plant disease) or indirectly via agricultural
input availability (e.g. loss of water source for irrigation). A
country's food availability is influenced by domestic food production
and international food trade. Food accessibility is influenced by its
food price, which responds to domestic (e.g. cost of food production and
distribution) and international (e.g. international food price) markets,
and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. food subsidies). Food
utilization is influenced by infrastructure/services (e.g. education)
and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. cultural traditions). [Food
insecurity is underpinned by]{.underline} these three pillars of [food
availability, food accessibility and food utilization. For a given
country, food insecurity can drive natural mortality]{.underline} (i.e.
starvation), [conflict and migration, contributing to population loss,
as well as economic shocks and socio-political instability, contributing
to institutional breakdown, which exacerbates the risk of societal
collapse.]{.underline}∂ [Beyond a given country suffering increased
natural mortality, famines (i.e. food insecurity) can place pressure on
international humanitarian efforts]{.underline} (i.e. institutional risk
factors). [Conflict may occur domestically or internationally and can
feedback to exacerbate food insecurity and institutional
fragility]{.underline} (i.e. institutional risk factors). [Potential
mass emigration can increase pressure on food availability, natural
resources and infrastructure/services in the destination nation, which
can lead to socio-cultural tensions]{.underline} (i.e. institutional
risk factors) [that fuel conflict. Food insecurity can also directly
contribute to institutional risk factors such as social unrest,
political instability and economic inequality, which increase the risk
of societal collapse due to institutional breakdown, that may also
cascade internationally]{.underline}. While already fragile states are
expected to be hit the worst directly, these insights reveal the
indirect ramifications of climate change on our globalised society (Kemp
2020), with serious conse- quences for humanity's 'existential security'
(Sears 2020).

### Extensions -- nutrition 

#### Biotechnology can help create foods to solve global nutrition issues.

**Jamil, no date**

Solution to Hunger?" United Nation UN Chronicle, no date,

Nevertheless, the potential [advantages that biotechnology can confer
across a wide range of agricultural applications are in areas such as
livestock management, storage of agricultural products and sustaining
current crop yields, while reducing the use of fertilizers, herbicides
and pesticides.]{.underline} The real challenge is whether we are smart
enough to harness the benefits of biotechnological solutions. But what
are these solutions? [Biotechnology offers a very promising alternative
to synthetic foods and an improvement on conventional plant-breeding
technologies. Combined with other advanced agricultural technologies, it
offers an exciting and environmentally responsible way to meet consumer
demand for sustainable agricultur]{.underline}e. When the [benefits of
GM crops reach small and marginal farmers, more Green Revolutions may
become a reality.]{.underline} Combating Hunger and Malnutrition
Malnutrition is the related term in medicine for hunger. The most recent
estimate of the Food and Agriculture Organization says that 854 million
people worldwide are undernourished. This is 12.6 per cent of 6.6
billion people in the world. Many of the 854 million that are
undernourished, children being the most visible victims, live in
developing countries. [Undernutrition magnifies the impact of every
disease, including measles and malaria.]{.underline} One example tells
us how [biotechnology can contribute to combating global hunger and
malnutrition]{.underline}. Golden Rice Approximately 140 million
children in low-income groups in 118 countries, especially in Africa and
South-East Asia, are deficient in Vitamin A. This situation has
compounded into a public health challenge. The World Health Organization
reports that an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 Vitamin A-deficient
children become blind every year, half of them dying within 12 months of
losing their sight[. Golden Rice, created by researchers in Germany and
Switzerland, contains]{.underline} three new [genes]{.underline} \-- two
[from the daffodil and]{.underline} one from a bac[terium \-- that helps
it to produce provitamin A. This rice is available as a possible option
for mass distribution, in part due to the waiving of patent rights by
biotechnology companies. This is just one among the hundreds
of]{.underline} new [biotech products, which point to the contributions
of biotechnology to society.]{.underline}

Having a super soldier in the ranks is a tantalising prospect for
militaries - imagine a soldier who could withstand pain, extreme cold or
the need to sleep. But as American attempts to build \"Iron Man\" show,
technological restraint can drag ambition down to earth. A 2019 paper
from two US academics said that [China\'s military was \"actively
exploring\" such techniques as gene editing, exoskeletons and
human-machine collaboration]{.underline}. The report was based primarily
on comments from Chinese military strategists. One of the authors, Elsa
Kania, was sceptical about Mr Ratcliffe\'s comments. \"[It\'s important
to understand what the Chinese military is discussing and aspiring to
actualise, but also to recognise the distance between those ambitions to
the reality of where technology is at this moment,\"]{.underline} said
Ms Kania, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.
[\"Even though militaries around the world may have quite a lot of
interest in the possibility of super soldiers\... at the end of the day,
what is feasible within science does impose a constraint on on any actor
that is trying to try to push the frontiers.\"]{.underline}

researching gene drive, we're not only looking at the benefits (i.e.
what it could do that would be useful) but also we're trying to
understand the potentials risks involved, including the impacts they may
have on other species. [So could a gene drive organism lead to a
species' extinction?]{.underline} As I mentioned in the post Gene drive
myth-busting[: Gene drive will spread globally, gene drives can be
designed so that they will not spread through an entire
species]{.underline}. There are also regulations and guidance in place
to make sure gene drive organisms will be kept in laboratories and
tested thoroughly before they would be considered for use in the

that gene drive could crash an entire species.]{.underline} This is due
to [factors such as barriers to spatial spread, differences in fitness
of gene drive carrying individuals]{.underline} (compared to the wild
type[), and the eventual development of resistance]{.underline}. In the
case of malaria, a common misconception that I have heard is that we are
trying to eradicate mosquitoes. In fact, [we are able to target a gene
drive so that it only affects a few species of malaria carrying
mosquitoes]{.underline} (and leaves all the many other mosquito species
alone). The aim is to reduce their numbers to a low level so that the
disease transmission cycle is broken. [Eradicating malaria does not
require eradicating the mosquitoes that transmit it.]{.underline}

### Extensions -- disruption 

#### Ukraine war disrupting European biotech development -- multiple elements 

**Smith, 2022**

\[Jonathan, "European biotech industry braces as war erupts in Ukraine"
Labiotech, March 1, 2022
<https://www.labiotech.eu/trends-news/ukraine-war-europe-biotech/>
GDI-TM\]

[Europe]{.underline} has been blindsided by its biggest war in decades
with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Amid a raging humanitarian crisis,
the [biotech industry is preparing for increasing economic uncertainty,
cyber threats, and clinical trial disruptions.]{.underline} The invasion
of Ukraine by Russian forces last week caused a widespread outcry from
the European community. The geopolitical landscape has undergone a
historic shift and the tragic consequences of the event are rippling out
to the European biotech industry. "The conflict in Ukraine is above all
an enormous and deplorable shock to all of us," said Miguel Forte, CEO
of the Belgian regenerative medicine specialist Bone Therapeutics. "Our
thoughts should go for those people, both in Ukraine and Russia,
directly affected by reckless and irresponsible leadership." [The crisis
has many facets and the biotech industry in Europe is preparing itself
for challenges on a number of fronts.]{.underline} The human crisis The
human cost of the invasion is expected to be heavy, with deaths and
injuries from the conflict currently numbering in the hundreds, and a
growing number of refugees moving west. The supply of lifesaving
medications to and from the region are already being disrupted; the
World Health Organization recently reported an urgent shortage of oxygen
for use in healthcare in Ukraine. Another factor at play is the clamping
down on air travel and shipments to and from Russian companies. "The
primary and immediate consequences will be affecting Ukraine, but the
impact could also likely be felt in Russia and for the Russian
population," said Forte. He added that other countries could be hit
indirectly by the chaos. [For life science companies, the impact will be
strong in countries close to the epicenter of the conflict]{.underline},
including the Baltic states and Eastern European nations. These
countries are facing uncertainty from the neighboring crisis, and many
resident companies have employees and close contacts in Ukraine. [In the
Lithuanian life sciences industry, there are "companies that have
business units, collaborations, and clients in Ukraine, which now has
stopped]{.underline}," said Monika Paule, CEO of the Lithuanian gene
editing specialist CasZyme. "Companies are willing to relocate their
employees, move collaborations to other countries, but all hope to get
back to operations in Ukraine when the conflict is over." While
countries close to the conflict face large challenges, Paule sees life
science companies in these regions also playing a strong role in
alleviating the situation. "The sector is ready to help Ukraine by all
means during and after the conflict either with medical supplies or
bringing business activities back to the country," she said. Clinical
trials caught in the middle [European biotech companies now face delays
to clinical trials]{.underline} that are being run in Ukraine and
Russia. The two countries have increasingly contributed to international
studies over the last 10 years thanks to easy access to patient
populations; [Forte told me there are currently about 500 ongoing
studies in Ukraine and over three times more in Russia. The ability of
the sponsors, contract research organizations, and suppliers to keep
going during the invasion is limited.]{.underline} "We can expect
centers in Ukraine to shut down immediately to protect its staff and
patients," said Antoine Papiernik, Managing Partner of the investment
firm Sofinnova Partners. "[For Russian centers, the integrity of data
from those sites might be at stake, and trials that are reliant on those
sites will likely be affected."]{.underline}

#### War and sanctions impact biotech investment -- limited resources

GDI-TM\]

Financial consequences threaten biotech stocks In addition to the human
tragedy caused by the events in Ukraine, [financial aftershocks are
expected.]{.underline} Many European nations have launched a volley of
sanctions against Russia and its ally Belarus. These include bans on
investments flowing to Russia-based banking and oil industries in
addition to the removal of some Russian banks from SWIFT, the
international financial transactions system. [The current conflict and
resulting sanctions on Russia could have direct and psychological
repercussions on the overall business environment in Europe and scare
off already risk-averse investors from the biotech scene]{.underline}.
Forte sees less impact on early-stage private investment, but [bad news
for public biotech firms and life sciences companies at later stages of
drug development. This blow comes as biotech stocks are already in an
anemic situation due in part to inflation fears.]{.underline} "It was
already tough in Europe since the beginning of the year, and it might
worsen even more," said Bertrand Delsuc, founder of the business
intelligence firm Biotech Radar. "Cash is king, more than ever."
Nonetheless, Papiernik is confident that the biotech industry can pull
through. "Biotech has, in the past, demonstrated resilience compared to
many other industries," said Papiernik. "Protecting human lives in the
immediate term remains the priority, but I hope we can also preserve the
infrastructure enabling us to develop drugs that will help patients in
need over the long term."

Cyberthreats to life sciences grow Part of the modern military arsenal
is cyberattacks, and [cyber threats are growing as Europe and the US
slap economic sanctions on Russia.]{.underline} "Several cybersecurity
agencies and government bodies have warned about Russia's ability to
retaliate asymmetrically through cyber means," said Charles Fracchia,
CEO of the US firm BioBright. "[This means that any sectors of the EU,
NATO, and the US economy are likely to be targets, including critical
sectors such as banking, healthcare, and life sciences. In life
sciences, the threat is probably highest for critical operations such as
vaccine manufacturing, biomanufacturing more broadly, and large clinical
centers."]{.underline} [Life sciences companies have been caught in the
crossfire in the past]{.underline}; the US big pharma MSD lost over €1B
in 2017 when it was hit by malware known as 'notPetya,' designed by
Russia to target Ukraine. It took until January 2022 for MSD to claw
back damage payments from insurers. "The notPetya attack was ostensibly
not targeted at \[MSD\], and yet, it had this enormous effect, thousands
of miles away," said Fracchia. "\[MSD\] was big enough to withstand
this, but it is clear that our industry could not withstand a targeted
attack, to say nothing of the smaller biotech's ability to survive
altogether." [To endure pressing threats from cyberattacks, biotech
companies are advised to assess their security measures and keep them up
to date.]{.underline}

## Biotech Regulations -- limited now 

### Limited biotech regulation -- GMOs 

#### Relaxing regulations increase ability to modify plants without government oversigh 

**Stokstad, 2020**

[A major change to U.S. regulation of biotech will exempt some
gene-edited plants from government oversight]{.underline}. [The new
policy]{.underline}, published in the Federal Register today, also calls
for [automatic approval of variations of established kinds of
genetically modified (GM) crops, easing their path to
market.]{.underline} Industry groups are welcoming the new rule, whereas
opponents are decrying the reduction of government oversight. \"The main
good thing is that it will allow certain aspects of gene editing to move
forward,\" says Kent Bradford, a plant geneticist at the University of
California, Davis. [If researchers use gene editing to design a plant
that could have been bred conventionally, the new plant will be exempt
from regulation.]{.underline} But anything else---such as moving a gene
between species or rewiring metabolism---will still require a regulatory
review. [The gist of the shift]{.underline} is that the U.S. Department
of Agriculture\'s (USDA\'s) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) [will now focus on new traits themselves rather than the
technology used to create them]{.underline}, a change of approach that
plant scientists have long wanted. Several reviews by the National
Academy of Sciences have concluded that the risk that GM plants will
become weeds is generally low, and that [molecular tools typically
don\'t pose new risks compared with traditional plant breeding
techniques.]{.underline} The change to the USDA regulations began during
the Obama administration. The Trump administration released draft rules
in January 2017, then withdrew them 9 months later. (In its new rule,
USDA says it received comments that the previous version would be \"too
burdensome and had the potential to stifle innovation.\") Last summer,
USDA released a revised rule for public comment, which it has now
finalized. [An engineered plant won\'t be regulated if it contains minor
changes---a change to a pair of amino acid bases or a deletion of a
chunk of DNA---that would create a trait that could have been made
through traditional breeding.]{.underline} For example, molecular
biologists can snip disease resistance genes from various parts of a
plant\'s genome and gather them into one stretch of DNA, allowing
breeders to easily incorporate all the genes into one variety. [The end
product will be the same as what might be created by breeders, but gene
editing can save years of effort]{.underline}, Bradford says. \"This
makes everything hugely easier.\" But he\'s frustrated that the
exemption doesn\'t cover more substantive changes or moving genes
between closely related plants, such as peppers and tomatoes, which
can\'t be crossed with conventional breeding. Another change will make
it [easier to create minor variations of GM crops, such as tailoring
them for different climates. B]{.underline}efore, companies had to ask
APHIS to evaluate the risk of any new GM crop they wished to
commercialize, even if it had been altered in the same way as crops
already approved. Now, APHIS [won\'t regulate new varieties of an
already approved GM crop]{.underline}.

oversight,\"]{.underline} Gregory Jaffe of the Center for Science in the

# Biotech bad -- impact debate

## Accidental release -- viruses 

### 1nc/2ac

#### Expanded investment in biotech and DNA labs increase risk of virus release from lab 

**Piper, 2022**

\[Kelsay, "Why experts are terrified of a human-made pandemic --- and
what we can do to stop it" VOX, Apr 5, 2022,
<https://www.vox.com/22937531/virus-lab-safety-pandemic-prevention>
GDI-TM\]

Decades ago, when the world first agreed on the norms and guidelines in
the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), designing and producing
biological weapons was expensive and difficult. The Soviet Union had a
large program, which is suspected to have led to the accidental release
of at least one influenza virus that caused tens of thousands of deaths.
But the Soviets seem to have never finalized anything deadlier than what
nature came up with. Terrorist groups engaged in biological terrorism
--- like the Aum Shinrikyo cult, which launched a botched bioattack in
Japan in 1993 --- have so far largely been unable to improve on anthrax,
a naturally occurring pathogen that is deadly to those who inhale it but
isn't contagious and won't circulate the globe the way a pandemic
disease can. But [our ability to engineer viruses has grown by leaps and
bounds]{.underline} in recent years[, thanks in part to the rapidly
falling price of DNA sequencing and DNA synthesis
technologies.]{.underline} [Those advances have opened the door to
innovations in medicine, but they also present a challenge:]{.underline}
[Viruses as deadly and disruptive as Covid-19, or potentially much
worse, are going to be possible to produce in labs worldwide soon, if
not right now.]{.underline} To prevent pandemics that could be far worse
than Covid-19, the world has to dramatically change our approach to
managing global biological risks. "Amateur biologists can now accomplish
feats that would have been impossible until recently for even the
foremost experts in top-of-the-line laboratories," argued Barry Pavel, a
national security policy director at the Atlantic Council, and Atlantic
Council co-author Vikram Venkatram. [Avoiding a catastrophe in the
coming decades will require us to take the risks of human-caused
pandemics far more seriously, by doing everything from changing how we
do research to making it harder for people to "print" themselves a copy
of a deadly virus.]{.underline} Covid-19 was a warning shot for how fast
a pandemic disease can spread around the world, and how ill-equipped we
are to protect ourselves from a truly killer virus[. If the world takes
that warning shot seriously, we can insulate ourselves against the next
pandemic, be it naturally occurring or human-made. With the right steps,
we could even make ourselves "highly resistant if not immune to
human-targeted biological threats,"]{.underline} MIT biologist Kevin
Esvelt told me. [But if we ignore the threat, the consequences could be
devastating.]{.underline} Lab origins of pathogens, explained It isn't
known for certain whether the virus that caused Covid-19 was an
accidental release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which was
studying similar coronaviruses, or a far more common "zoonotic
spillover" from an animal in the wild. An analysis by the US
intelligence community found both possibilities plausible. A pair of
preprint studies published in 2022 pointed toward a live animal market
in Wuhan as the origin of the first outbreak. And recent reporting in
[Vanity Fair spotlighted risky and reckless research modifying
coronaviruses in the lab to study whether they would infect humans more
easily, and detailed how the scientists conducting such research closed
ranks to ensure their work was not blamed for the pandemic. The reality
is we may never know for sure. I]{.underline}t can take years to
conclusively trace back a zoonotic disease to its animal source, and
China has made it clear it won't cooperate with further investigations
that could clarify any role WIV research may have played in Covid's
origin, however inadvertently. Whatever chain of events caused Covid-19,
[we already know that infectious disease outbreaks can originate in a
lab.]{.underline} In 1978, a year after the final reported cases of
smallpox in the wild, a lab leak caused an outbreak in the UK.
Photographer Janet Parker died, while her mother got a mild case and
recovered; more than 500 people who'd been exposed were vaccinated.
(Smallpox vaccination can protect against smallpox even after an
exposure[.) Only that quick, large-scale response prevented what could
have been a full-blown recurrence of the once-extinct
disease.]{.underline} That's not our only close brush with the return of
smallpox, a disease that killed an estimated 300 million people in the
20th century alone. Six unsecured smallpox vials were discovered sitting
in a refrigerator in the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2014,
having been forgotten there for decades among 327 vials of various
diseases and other substances. One of the vials had been compromised,
the FDA found --- thankfully not one of the ones containing smallpox or
another deadly disease. [Other diseases have been at the center of
similar lab mishaps]{.underline}. In March 2014, a Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) researcher in Atlanta accidentally
contaminated a vial of a fairly harmless bird flu with a far deadlier
strain. The contaminated virus was then shipped to at least two
different agricultural labs. One noticed the mistake when their chickens
sickened and died, while the other was not notified for more than a
month. The mistake was communicated to CDC leadership only when the CDC
conducted an extensive investigation in the aftermath of a different
mistake --- the potential exposure of 75 federal employees to live
anthrax, after a lab that was supposed to inactivate the anthrax samples
accidentally prepared activated ones. After SARS emerged in 2003, there
were six separate incidents of SARS infections resulting from lab leaks.
Meanwhile, last December, a researcher in Taiwan caught Covid-19 at a
moment when the island had been successfully suppressing outbreaks,
going without a domestic case for more than a month. Retracing her
steps, Taiwan authorities suspected she'd caught the virus from a bite
by an infected mouse in a high-security biology lab. "[The fact is that
laboratory accidents are not rare in life sciences,"]{.underline} former
Sen. Joe Lieberman told the bipartisan Commission on Biodefense this
March. "[As countries throughout the world build additional laboratories
to conduct research on highly infectious and deadly pathogens, it's
clear that the pace of laboratory accidents will naturally
increase.]{.underline}

the possibility that they could either spread indefinitely or accidently
manipulate nontargeted species have raised concerns among
regulators.]{.underline}

[Similar experimental techniques, like sterilizing insects en masse,
have been conducted in the past]{.underline}. One technique involves the
mass sterilization of a targeted pest, such as fruit flies, using
irradiation. [Scientists advocating for gene drives argue that
irradiation can cause random mutations, which might also have
unintentional effects on the environment]{.underline}. [Such off-target
mutations can be avoided using gene drive technology that relies on
genomic information obtained through reliable DNA sequencing
tool]{.underline}s. Although the technology has immense beneficial
applications, it is important to update existing regulations and
initiate public discourse on the benefits and the risks of this emerging
technology

Recent advances in [synthetic biology,]{.underline} a technology that
can be used to artificially create organisms in labs, [carry the
foreboding potential to develop biological weapons. Moreover, the
emergence of the DIY community and the open-source nature of this
movement have sparked concerns that terrorists could easily acquire the
information needed to weaponize biotechnology]{.underline}, although
none of these DIY groups have exhibited any nefarious intentions.
[Nefarious actors who previously acquired pathogens from a lab or from
nature with the intention of developing a bioweapon can now either order
DNA fragments online and assemble them to create dangerous pathogens or
synthesize lethal pathogens from scratch using genomic information
available online.]{.underline} Moreover, such actors can leverage
vulnerabilities in the cyber defenses of labs and private companies to
gain access to sensitive information that is not publicly available
online. [To better understand the security threats emerging from recent
developments in biotechnology]{.underline}, it is worthwhile to return
to the aforementioned hypothetical Ebola scenario[. Imagine for a moment
that the researchers involved,]{.underline} in collaboration with an
editor at an esteemed journal, decided that they would publish a
redacted version of the methods and the results section of their
research due to security concerns. A month after the paper was
published, [the lab noticed unusual activity on their servers. The lab
immediately reported the incident]{.underline} to the university's
information technology department. [The department contacted local law
enforcement officials, and together they traced the hack to a suspected
terrorist organization. The group was trying to gain access to the
methodology that led to the accidental creation of a more virulent Ebola
strain so as to launch a deliberate biological attack.]{.underline} Law
enforcement put DNA synthesis companies on high alert for any orders
that closely aligned with research on the Ebola virus or other high-risk
pathogens. Thankfully, a company was able to flag an order and law
enforcement was able to cooperate with local officials to shut down the
unauthorized lab before it began creating and releasing harmful
products. [In reality, individuals have at times tried to acquire deadly
pathogens and other sensitive biological information]{.underline}. For
example, two Canadians were arrested in the city of Buffalo, New York in
1984 after they were suspected of illegally acquiring and smuggling
strains of botulism and tetanus to Canada. The Japanese cult Aum
Shinrikyo made unsuccessful attempts in 1995 to acquire strains of Ebola
from Central Africa to develop the group's biological weapons program.
More recently, two Chinese hackers were indicted in the United States
for seeking to obtain intellectual property related to coronavirus
treatments and vaccines. Similar incidents were reported in Spain;
allegedly Chinese hackers were trying to steal data from Spanish labs
conducting vaccine research. [In addition to strategically embedding
members into research organizations to acquire these deadly pathogens,
some terrorist organizations also have sought to rely on lab insiders to
either develop biological weapons or grant access to organisms or
sensitive information]{.underline}. For example, a Malaysian scientist
tried to develop anthrax weapons for Osama bin Laden, the founder of
al-Qaeda. While most countries have national guidelines for handling
safety and security threats[, the examples described above highlight the
global implications of such threats]{.underline}. It is therefore
important to evaluate global best practices, treaties, and conventions
that deal with such risks and devise strategies to update these
safeguards to govern dual-use applications of emerging biotechnologies.

#### b. Bioweapons use bad -- and independently, Biotech based attacks are an existential risk

Pandemics

The [misuse of biotechnology is another existential risk]{.underline}
that keeps researchers up at night. This is technology that harnesses
biology to make new products. One in particular concerns Cassidy Nelson:
[the abuse of biotechnology to engineer deadly, quick-spreading
pathogens]{.underline}. \"I worry about a whole range of different
pandemic scenarios. But I do think [the ones that could be man-made are
possibly the greatest threat we could have from biology this
century,\"]{.underline} she said.

As [acting co-lead of the biosecurity team at the Future of Humanity
Institute]{.underline} at the University of Oxford in the United
Kingdom, [Nelson researches biosecurity issues]{.underline} that face
humanity, [such as new infectious diseases, pandemics and biological
weapons.]{.underline} She recognizes that [a pathogen that\'s been
specifically engineered to be as contagious and deadly as possible could
be far more damaging than a natural pathogen, potentially dispatching
large swathes of Earth\'s population in limited time. \"Nature is
pretty]{.underline} phenomenal at coming up with pathogens through
natural selection. It\'s [terrible]{.underline} when it does. [But it
doesn\'t have this kind of direct \'intent,\'\"]{.underline} Nelson
explained. \"My concern would be if you had [a bad actor]{.underline}
who [intentionally tried to design a pathogen to have as much negative
impact as possible, through how contagious]{.underline} it was,
[and]{.underline} how [deadly it was."]{.underline}

[Alongside the near certainty that there will be more lab escapes in the
future, engineering the viruses that could conceivably cause a pandemic
if they escaped is getting cheaper and easier]{.underline}. [That means
it's now possible for a single lab or small group to conceivably cause
mass destruction across the whole world, either deliberately or by
accident.]{.underline}

"[Potential large-scale effects of attempted bioterrorism have been
mitigated in the past by terrorists' lack of expertise, and the inherent
challenge of using biotechnology to make and release dangerous
pathogens. Now, as people gain greater access to this technology and it
becomes easier to use, the challenge is easing]{.underline}," Pavel
argues. The result? ["Incidents of bioterrorism soon will become more
prevalent."]{.underline}

DNA synthesis and how it changes the bioweapons calculus "[Advances in
synthetic biology and biotechnology make it easier than ever before to
make pathogens more lethal and transmissible, and advances in the life
sciences are occurring at a pace that governments have been unable to
keep up with, which increases the risk of deliberate or accidental
releases of dangerous pathogens]{.underline}," Lieberman told the
bipartisan Commission on Biodefense in March. One of the most exciting
recent areas of progress in biology has been the increasing ease of DNA
synthesis --- the ability to "print" DNA (or RNA, which makes up the
genetic material of viruses like influenzas, coronaviruses, measles, or
polio) from a known sequence. [It used to be that creating a
specifically desired DNA sequence was incredibly expensive or
impossible; now, it is much more straightforward and relatively
cheap]{.underline}, with multiple companies in the business of providing
mail-order genes. While scientific skill is still very much required to
produce a virus, it is nowhere near as expensive as it used to be, and
can be done by a much smaller team. Thomas Ybert, co-founder and CEO of
biotech company DNA Script, works on the beta version of the world's
first benchtop DNA printer in August 2020, near Paris. In June 2021 DNA
Script announced the commercial launch of the "printer," which can
create synthetic DNA fragments that can be used by laboratories. Eric
Piermont/AFP via Getty Images This is great news; DNA synthesis enables
a great deal of important and valuable biology research. [But progress
in DNA synthesis has been so fast that coordination against dangerous
actors who might misuse it has lagged.]{.underline} Furthermore,
checking the sequence against a list of known dangerous sequences
requires researchers to maintain a list of known dangerous sequences ---
which is itself something bad actors could use to cause harm. [The
result is an "information hazard," what the existential risk scholar
Nick Bostrom defines as "risks that arise from the dissemination or the
potential dissemination of true information that may cause harm or
enable some agent to cause harm." "DNA is an inherently dual-use
technology,"]{.underline} James Diggans, who works on biosecurity at the
industry-leading synthetic DNA provider Twist Bioscience, told me in
2020. [What that means is DNA synthesis makes fundamental biology
research and lifesaving drug development go faster, but it can also be
used to do research that can be deadly for humanity.]{.underline}

### AT biodefense -- increases risk of virus escape

#### Biodefense and bioweapons overlap -- gain of function research proves and risk inadvertent spread

But the BWC is underfunded and little-prioritized despite the magnitude
of the threat biological weapons pose. It has just a few staff members
running its implementation support unit, compared to hundreds at the
Chemical Weapons Convention, and a budget smaller than that of the
average McDonald's franchise. The US could easily bolster the BWC
significantly with a relatively small funding commitment, and should
absolutely do so. And despite the treaty's broad aims, [much of the work
to identify dangerous pathogens that could potentially act as bioweapons
is still ongoing]{.underline} --- not as part of Cold War-era covert
programs deliberately designed to create pathogens for military
purposes, [but through well-intentioned programs to study and learn
about viruses that have the potential to cause the next
pandemic]{.underline}. That means the [Biological Weapons Convention
does little to constrain much of the research that now poses the
greatest risk of future biological weapons use, even if the release of
those viruses would be entirely inadvertent]{.underline}.**[One such
type of science is what's called "gain of function" research, in which
researchers make viruses more transmissible or more deadly in humans as
part of studying how those viruses might evolve in the
wild]{.underline}**. "I first heard about [gain of function
research]{.underline} in the 1990s, only then we [had a different
term]{.underline} for it: [biological weapons research and
development,"]{.underline} Andy Weber, former assistant secretary of
defense for nuclear, chemical, and biological defense programs in the
Obama administration and now a senior fellow at the Council on Strategic
Risks, told me. "[The intent is 180 degrees off]{.underline} --- [NIH is
trying to save the world from pandemics --- but the content is almost
entirely overlapping."]{.underline} The status of gain of function
research has been hotly contested over the last decade. In 2014, after
the series of scary lab safety and containment failures I outlined above
and after revelations of alarming gain of function work on bird flu, the
[NIH,]{.underline} which funds much of the cutting-edge biology research
worldwide[, imposed a moratorium on gain of function work]{.underline}
on pathogens with pandemic potential like influenza or SARS. [But in
2017, the moratorium was lifted without much explanation.]{.underline}
Right now, the [US is funding gain of function work at a few select
laboratories,]{.underline} despite the objections of many leading
biologists who argue that the limited benefits of this work aren't worth
the costs. In 2021, a bill was introduced to prohibit federal research
grants that fund gain of function research on SARS, MERS, and influenza
viruses.

#### Gain of function research increases risk of bioweapons research -- ending funding for this research that on balance doesn't help with pandemic 

**Piper, 2022**

\[Kelsay, "Why experts are terrified of a human-made pandemic --- and

<https://www.vox.com/22937531/virus-lab-safety-pandemic-prevention>
GDI-TM\]

[Beyond the risk that a virus strengthened through gain of function work
might accidentally escape and trigger a larger outbreak]{.underline} ---
which is one theory, albeit unproven, for how Covid-19 began --- [it can
be hard to differentiate legitimate, if risky, research from deliberate
efforts to create malign pathogens. "Because of our government support
for this risky gain of function research, we've created the perfect
cover for countries that want to do biological weapons
research,]{.underline}" Weber told me. [The No. 1 thing he'd recommend
to prevent the next pandemic? "Ending government funding for risky
research that plausibly could have caused this and future pandemics."
Another potentially risky area of virology research involves identifying
animal species that act as reservoirs of viruses that have the potential
to cross over into humans and cause a pandemic]{.underline}. Scientists
involved in this work go out to remote areas to take samples of those
pathogens with dangerous potential, bring them back to the lab, and
determine whether they might be able to infect human cells. This is
precisely what researchers at the WIV apparently did in the years
leading up to Covid-19 as they searched for the animal source of the
original SARS virus. [Such work was advertised as a way to prevent
pandemic-capable pathogens from crossing over into humans, but it was
largely useless when it came time to fight SARS-CoV-2,]{.underline}
Weber says. "After having done this work for 15 years, I think there's
little to show for it," Weber told me. That's not the only view within
the virology community, but it's not a rare one. Weber thinks Covid-19
should lead to a rethinking. "As the intelligence community concluded,
it's plausible that it actually caused this pandemic. It was of zero
help in preventing this pandemic or even predicting this pandemic."

### AT no non-state actor access to DNA

That's the conundrum that biosecurity researchers --- in industry, in
academia, and in the government --- are faced with today: trying to
figure out how to make DNA synthesis faster and cheaper for its many
beneficial uses while ensuring every printed sequence is screened and
hazards are appropriately handled. If that sounds like a challenging
problem now, it's only likely to get worse in the future. [As DNA
synthesis gets ever cheaper and easier, many researchers anticipate the
creation of tabletop synthesizers that would allow labs to simply print
their own DNA as needed for their research, no middleman
needed.]{.underline} [Something like a tabletop synthesizer could make
for awesome progress in biology --- and worsen the challenge of
preventing bad actors from printing out dangerous viruses. And as DNA
synthesis gets cheaper, screening for dangerous sequences becomes a
larger percentage of the cost, and so the financial advantage of cutting
corners on screening could become bigger, as companies that don't do
screening may be able to offer considerably lower prices.]{.underline}

## CRISPR bad -- mutations in not targeted cells

#### CRISPR tech risk mutations -- modifications risk cause mutations on non-targeted and targeted

There is little doubt that since it was created, the CRISPR-Cas9 gene
editing system has been revolutionary in the research lab. Since there
are some very small errors in the human genetic sequence that lead to
serious and deadly diseases, researchers have long been searching for
effective ways to repair those errors. But [altering the genome is
challenging, and comes with risks]{.underline}. In the
[CRISPR]{.underline} genome-editing technique, scientists can target a
specific, short sequence of DNA with an enzyme called [Cas9]{.underline}
that can cut genomic DNA. The tool [is meant to selectively
target]{.underline} the int[ended sequence, but the system is not
error-proof.]{.underline} Some [unintended cuts might
occur]{.underline}, and the likelihood may depend on several factors,
including what sequence is being taageted. There are also computational
tools that are meant to help researchers select sequences that will not
lead to off-target or unintended effects, or at least minimize that
chance. There are also some experimental techniques that can reduce the
risk. That specificity will be crucial if CRISPR-Cas9 is to be used
widely in the clinic with patients. However, [new research
reported]{.underline} in Nature Communications [has suggested that the
CRISPR-Cas9 tool may be less exclusive than desired, and that unintended
errors can be introduced which are then passed on to
offspring]{.underline}. CRISPR may be very useful to modify the genomes
of microbes, animals, or plants, but the study authors have suggested
that the [utmost caution should be used if CRISPR will be applied to
patients. There are]{.underline} a [few limited cases in which CRISPR
has been used to treat people.]{.underline} In the United States, a
small number of sickle-cell anemia patients who are adults have received
the treatment (as explained in the video below). From what we know so
far, it\'s been safe and effective. However, when a [scientist in China
claimed to have modified the genomes of human embryos]{.underline} who
were later delivered, it was done [under a veil of secrecy, and little
is known about the outcome]{.underline} of those experiments. In this
study, the researchers used a common research model, the zebrafish, to
study the impact of CRISPR-Cas9 over two generations. Because zebrafish
have many genes and biological processes in common with people, it\'s
thought that they mimic what might be seen in other organisms including
humans. The [investigators]{.underline} assessed the genomes of over
1,000 zebrafish from two generations, and [revealed unexpected
mutations. There were also different kinds of mutations]{.underline}. In
some cases, the [fragments of DNA that were edited were much bigger than
desired.]{.underline} In other instances, [genomic mutations popped up
in unintended places]{.underline}. These [errors were seen
in]{.underline} both the zebrafish that were treated with CRISPR and
their [offspring]{.underline}. \"Knowing these [unexpected mutations are
heritable]{.underline} is important, since [they can have long-term
consequences for future generations.]{.underline} But that can happen
only if you change the genome of embryos or germ cells,\" noted Ida
Höijer, Ph.D. of Uppsala University. In the case of the sickle-cell
patients, who are adults, their germ cells were not targeted and it
would be assumed that there is little to no chance they\'d be affected.
That would also be the case for other tissues that might be targeted in
adults with CRISPR. While these applications would theoretically pose no
risk to future generations, the researchers noted that caution is still
advisable.

## Designer babies 

### 1nc/2ac -- targeting people with disabilities 

#### Biotech use governed by societal assumptions about ability, disease -- used to unethically fix people

Slippery slopes and putting the person back into our conceptions of
disability and disease Several prominent academics argue that
[scientists]{.underline}, bioethicists and medical practitioners [should
not be the people solely informing ethical discussions about editing the
human germline]{.underline}. They say that [their ethical
frameworks]{.underline} relative to medical safety, beneficence and
informed consent [are too limited to consider the possibilities of such
editing appropriately]{.underline}. For example, Dr Sandy Sufian,
Professor of Disability and Human Development at the University of
Illinois, Chicago; and Dr John H. Evans, the Tata Chancellor's Professor
in Social Sciences and the co-director of the Institute of Public Ethics
at the University of California, San Diego, could not have a more
different view than Smith. Earlier this year, Sufian composed an op-ed
with collaborator Dr Rosemarie Garland Thompson for Scientific American
titled "The Dark Side of CRISPR," arguing that [the technology's
potential to "fix people" is a direct threat to the people society
regards as "biologically inferior".]{.underline} Their concern is also
with the [unreflective assumption that removing genetic disease through
technology is actually beneficial for sufferers and
societ]{.underline}y. "This is a technology that will be used with
people, affecting people, affecting the social world, in terms of who
inhabits the world," Sufian says. "[When you are conceptually detaching
a technology from the person, then you can claim that it is not against
people with disabilities per se, and you can make the argument that it
is a universal good]{.underline}." Sufian believes that most people
think germline editing technology is inherently beneficial and that this
applies even to the people with the genetic condition that could be
targeted for elimination. [This is because of the common perception that
disease is bad and should be avoided or eradicated.]{.underline} Yet
Sufian and Garland think that [people cannot be reduced to their disease
exclusively---it is a small portion of their human experience---and
instead of eliminating the disease, the priority should be maximising
the human potential of the affected person]{.underline}. Evans, for his
part, has applied a sociological '[slippery slope']{.underline} metaphor
[to describe the ethical implications of germline editing]{.underline}.
He argues that [CRISPR]{.underline} technologies, [coupled with a
reductionist medical ethical value system, have breached the ethical
limit between genetically targeting somatic disease and editing for
enhancemen]{.underline}t, a line that societies have traditionally used
to prevent unethical experimentation on humans. His 2020 book, The Human
Gene Editing Debate, describes this nondeterministic [slippery
slope]{.underline} as [having step A at the top]{.underline}, the most
meritorious action, [such as physician-assisted euthanasia]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} somatic [genetic editing for severe
disease]{.underline}, which is the least controversial, [to step D at
the bottom of the slope]{.underline}, the most maximally objectionable
action, [such as involuntary euthanasia or]{.underline} non-therapeutic
[genetic modification for enhancement in capabilities and traits such as
intelligence]{.underline}. Evans argues the descent down the slope is
encouraged by the social normalisation of interventions, which increases
the odds of accepting and legitimising more ethically controversial
interventions further down the line. This process occurs in many domains
and is arguably a key feature of how cultures change; a normative
process rather than an aberration. Evans offers the following
description of how descent down the slope could occur with genetic
editing: Everyone agrees that targeted gene editing for somatic sickle
cell disease is morally virtuous. So, let's get on the slope and do
that. There are people suffering. The problem is that you have now
changed the conditions for step B: I'm used to the idea of genetically
modifying humans now, so I guess \[I can consider step\] B where I'm not
modifying sickle cell but something like genetically caused deafness.
Well, it's kind of a disease, but it's also kind of not a disease, but
I'm kind of used to this, so I'll go there---so that becomes
normalised[\... At the bottom is]{.underline} the Brave New World or
Gattaca situation, which [is a society where people are designed for
particular genes for particular purposes.]{.underline}

### Extensions -- gene editing long term consequences

A [lab experiment aimed at fixing defective DNA in human embryos
shows]{.underline} [what can go wrong with this type of gene editing and
why leading scientists say it's too unsafe to try.]{.underline} In more
than half of the cases, the [editing caused unintended changes, such as
loss of an entire chromosome or big chunks of it.]{.underline} Columbia
University researchers describe their work Thursday in the journal Cell.
[They used CRISPR-cas9]{.underline}, the same chemical tool that a
Chinese scientist used on embryos in 2018 to help make the world's first
gene-edited babies, which landed him in prison and drew international
scorn. The tool lets scientists cut DNA in a precise spot and has
profound potential for good --- it's already used to raise better crops
and livestock, holds promise for treating diseases and earned its
discoverers a Nobel Prize earlier this month. But [using it on embryos,
sperm or eggs makes changes that can pass to future generations. Several
international panels of scientists and ethicists have said it's too soon
to know whether that can be done safely, and the new]{.underline}
Columbia [work shows the possible harm]{.underline}. "If our results had
been known two years ago, I doubt that anyone would have gone ahead" and
tried it on embryos intended for pregnancy, said biologist Dieter Egli,
who led the study. Researchers made 40 embryos with eggs from healthy
donors and sperm from a man with a gene mutation \-- a single letter
missing in the DNA alphabet \-- that causes blindness. [Editing was
aimed at adding the missing letter so the gene would work.]{.underline}
In some embryos, the editing was tried at fertilization, thought to be
the best time for such attempts. Other embryos were edited when they
contained two cells and were almost two days old. Cells then were
analyzed at various stages of development to see how many had the
mutation repaired. Surprisingly, it didn't work in any of the cells from
embryos edited at fertilization[. It only worked in three of the 45
cells]{.underline} from embryos edited at the later stage. In many of
the rest, "what we found is that [instead of the mutation being fixed,
the chromosome carrying the mutation is gone"]{.underline} [--- a
profound change that likely dooms the embryo]{.underline}, Egli said.
Many other cells showed changes in other chromosomes that also could do
harm. [Previous researchers who thought they had repaired a defect in
embryos may have been misled]{.underline} into thinking they had
succeeded because usual lab tests no longer detected the mutation[.
However, more extensive testing like what was done in this study shows
that other changes could have happened, such as an entire chromosome
being wiped out,]{.underline} Egli said. [The new work suggests that
gene editing might hold promise for correcting disorders caused by an
extra copy of a chromosome, such as Down syndrome. However, the danger
revealed in the new study "further affirms we are not ready, not even
close" to try this]{.underline}, Dr. Eric Topol wrote in an email. "This
takes the concerns that have already been expressed about human embryo
editing to another level," added Topol, who heads the Scripps Research
Translational Institute in San Diego and had no role in the new work. In
the U.S., federal funds can't be used for research on human embryos, so
the Columbia researchers used private money from two foundations.
Several of the scientists have ties to gene therapy or analysis
companies.

Needless to say, the enthusiasm is not universal[. Other environmental
groups worry that it will not prove possible to contain gene drives to a
single place]{.underline}, [and that species seen as invasive in one
place might end up decimated in other places]{.underline} [where they

engineered into species that play a pivotal but previously unappreciated
ecological role, or if they spread from a species of little ecological
consequence to a close relative that matters more, they could have

[Although allegations of playing God are two a penny in debates about
breakthrough technologies, with gene drives they do feel better-founded
than usual. The ability to remove species by fiat]{.underline}---in
effect, to get them to remove themselves---[is, like the prospect of
making new species from scratch, a power that goes beyond the past ambit
of humankind.]{.underline} Gene drives are, at heart, a particularly
selfish sort of gene. Most animals have two copies of most of their
genes, one on the set of chromosomes they got from their mother, one on
those from their father. But they put only one version of each
gene---either the maternal one or the paternal one, at random---into
each of their own gametes (sperm or eggs). Some genes, though, seek to
subvert this randomising in order to get into more than 50% of the
gametes, and thus more than 50% of the next generation. In 1960 George
Craig, an American entomologist, suggested that such subversive genes
might be a way of controlling the populations of disease-carrying
mosquitoes, for example by making them more likely to have male
offspring than female ones. In 2003 Austin Burt, at Imperial College,
described how a [gene drive that could cut a place for itself in a
chromosome and copy itself into the resulting gap could, in the right
circumstances, drive a species to extinction.]{.underline} A fascinating
idea, but one hard to put into practice---until, in 2012, a powerful new
gene-editing tool called crispr-Cas9 became available. Gene drives based
on crispr-Cas9 could easily be engineered to target specific bits of the
chromosome and insert themselves seamlessly into the gap, thus ensuring
that every gamete gets a copy (see diagram). By 2016, gene drives had
been created in yeast, fruitflies and two species of mosquito. In work
published in the journal Nature Biotechnology in September, Andrea
Crisanti, Mr Burt and colleagues at Imperial showed that one of their
gene drives could drive a small, caged population of the mosquito
Anopheles gambiae to extinction---the first time a gene drive had shown
itself capable of doing this. The next step is to try this in a larger
caged population.

In a report published in 2016, America's National Academies of Science
highlighted the possibility of drives introduced for agricultural
reasons damaging people's welfare. Excoriated as "pigweed" in the United
States, related species of the plant are cultivated for food in Mexico,
South America, India and China. American farmers might like a gene drive
to eradicate pigweed, which has become resistant to the herbicide
glyphosate, which is widely used in conjunction with today's genetically
modified crops. But they would not necessarily bear the risks, or
liability, of a release that went on to do damage to food crops in other
countries.

## Military applications

### Extensions - China expanding research -- military applications 

#### China increasing investment and experimentation into use of CRISPR

Universal Soldier and Captain America are just a few Hollywood movies
that have explored the concept of the super soldier. [Despite its sci-fi
nature, several countries are looking to explore the potential of such
prospects. Darpa intends to explore genetically editing soldiers to turn
them into "antibody factories", making them resistant to chemical or
biological attacks.]{.underline}

[In December 2020]{.underline}, the [then US director of national
intelligence]{.underline}, John Ratcliffe, said [there was evidence that
the Chinese military was conducting human experimentation in an attempt
to biologically boost soldiers.]{.underline} This followed a report by
the [Jamestown policy thinktank that highlighted reports suggesting that
Crispr would form a keystone technology in China to "boost troops'
combat effectiveness".]{.underline} No further details were given,
however.

#### China increased research into military applications of CRISPR

Last year, two American scholars wrote a paper examining [China\'s
ambitions to apply biotechnology to the battlefield, including what they
said were signs that China was interested in using gene-editing
technology to enhance human --- and perhaps soldier ---
performance]{.underline}. Specifically, the scholars explored [Chinese
research using the gene-editing tool CRISPR,]{.underline} short for
\"clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.\" CRISPR
has been used to treat genetic diseases and modify plants, but Western
scientists consider it unethical to seek to manipulate genes to boost
the performance of healthy people. \"[While the potential leveraging of
CRISPR to increase human capabilities on the future battlefield remains
only a hypothetical possibility at the present, there are indications
that Chinese military researchers are starting to explore its
potential,\"]{.underline} wrote the scholars, Elsa Kania, an expert on
Chinese defense technology at the Center for a New American Security,
and Wilson VornDick, a consultant on China matters and former Navy
officer. [\"Chinese military scientists and strategists have
consistently emphasized that biotechnology could become a \'new
strategic commanding heights of the future Revolution in Military
Affairs]{.underline},\'\" the scholars wrote, quoting a 2015 article in
a military newspaper.

### Extension -- military applications 

#### Multiple countries pursuing military application of CRISPR

The [UK government recently announced]{.underline} an £800 million,
taxpayer-funded Advanced Research and Invention Agency
([Aria]{.underline}). The brainchild of the British prime minister's
former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings and modelled on the US Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, Darpa, the organisation will focus
partly on genomic research. [Genome technology is becoming an
increasingly important part of military research.]{.underline} So given
that the UK boasts some of the best genomic research centres in the
world, how will its new agency affect the wider genome technology
warfare race? In 2019, [Darpa announced that it wishes to explore
genetically editing soldiers]{.underline}. It has also invested over
US\$65 million (£45 million) to improve the safety and accuracy of
genome-editing technologies. These include the famous Nobel
prize-winning [Crispr-Cas molecular scissor]{.underline} -- a tool that
can edit DNA by cutting and pasting sections of it. But [the ease of
accessibility and low cost of Crispr-based technologies has caused
concern around potential military genetic modification and weaponisation
of viruses or bacteria]{.underline}. These include smallpox or
tuberculosis, and [could be extremely destructive]{.underline}. [The US
is not alone in its military pursuit of genome technology. Russia and
China have either stated or been accused of using genomic technology to
enhance military capabilities.]{.underline}

### AT tech doesn't exist to make super soldiers 

#### Tech exists -- only thin barrier of whether scientist will choose to use 

**Poole, 2021**

\[Thom, "The myth and reality of the super soldier" BBC8 February 2021
<https://www.bbc.com/news/world-55905354> GDI-TM\]

Dr Helen O\'Neill, [a molecular geneticist]{.underline} from University
College London, [said the question was more about whether scientists
would be prepared to use this technology, rather than whether it was
possible. \"The technologies - of genome editing and its combination
with assisted reproduction - are becoming routine practices in
transgenics and agriculture, it\'s just the combination of the two for
human use that is seen as unethical at the moment.]{.underline}\"2
