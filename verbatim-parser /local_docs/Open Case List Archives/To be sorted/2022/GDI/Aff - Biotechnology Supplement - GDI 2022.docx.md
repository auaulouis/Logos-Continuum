### 1AC Plan (resilience)

**The United States federal government should substantially increase its
security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the
area of biotechnology by promoting and facilitating improved strategies
for biosecurity challenges based on the core concept of resilience,
emphasizing damage minimization and quick restoration of stability.**

### 1AC Solvency

#### Resilience-focused biotech cooperation with NATO spurs defensive and developmental advances

Jaclyn **Levy '21**, June 10, "Millennium Leadership Fellow at the
Atlantic Council and the director of public policy at the Infectious
Diseases Society of America," NEW ATLANTICIST, The best defense: Why
NATO should invest in resilience

The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified not only the successes and failures
of the world's health systems but also the importance of
**[[multilateral partnerships in biosecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Preparing for the next pandemic will [[require]{.underline}]{.mark}
[adaptation, [interconnectivity, and resilience]{.mark}---the capacity
to resist and recover quickly from major infrastructure
shocks]{.underline}. [Intergovernmental [alliances like NATO]{.mark} can
[play a **critical role**]{.mark} [in the **relationship- and
capacity-building** necessary for]{.mark} a healthy global
**[biosecurity]{.mark}** sphere, which ensures a more secure
world]{.underline}.

There are many lessons from the last fifteen months, but among them is a
time-honored proverb: [an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
cure]{.underline}. Many public-health and security crises are a product
of critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, but [[an expanded focus on
**resilience**]{.mark} in developing a global security [**strategy** can
prevent the next crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. Responding to emergencies
such as pandemics is far more expensive than preventing them and creates
additional costs such as strained political cohesion and waning support
for public institutions. [[Policies emphasizing resilience
should]{.mark} fundamentally [aim to **minimize damage**]{.mark},
**[restore stability]{.mark} quickly**, [and generate **improved
strategies**]{.mark} for similar issues]{.underline}. To this end, there
are several steps [[NATO can]{.underline}]{.mark} take to [[build a
preventive, resilience-based approach to emerging global
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty includes resilience as a critical
element of its mission to achieve collective defense, and the Alliance
supports multiple programs to build resilience against non-traditional
threats. At its 2016 Warsaw Summit, NATO committed to "continue to
enhance our resilience against the full spectrum of threats, including
hybrid threats, from any direction," and added that "resilience is an
essential basis for credible deterrence and defence and effective
fulfilment of the Alliance's core tasks." In June, NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg said during an appearance at the Atlantic
Council that [[a critical part of the Alliance's agenda]{.mark} over the
coming decade [is to support "resilience
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}."

The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear NATO's value in an unpredictable
world. In 2020, NATO troops supported civilian efforts to combat the
spread of COVID-19 by airlifting patients and medical equipment,
building field hospitals, distributing supplies, repatriating civilians,
establishing quarantine facilities and triage centers, assisting with
decontamination, and sharing medical expertise. After this pandemic
recedes, NATO's [[proposals for]{.underline}]{.mark} responding to
biothreats and other novel challenges should include investments in
[[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} to help [[combat "black swan"
events]{.underline}]{.mark}, which may turn existing health or
environmental emergencies into security crises. "Resilient societies are
our first line of defense," said NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea
Geoană in December, adding that "we have to put a much greater emphasis
on resilience" across government, the private sector, and civil society.

[[NATO should start advancing resilience by
leveraging]{.underline}]{.mark} and strengthening the following
policies, programs, and **[[partnerships]{.underline}]{.mark}**:

The NATO Science & Technology Organization (STO) develops innovative
solutions with global experts to ensure that the Alliance's
technological capacity meets its needs in a quickly changing world.
Allied governments contributed approximately 500 million euros to STO
last year, forming a pool of already-allocated funding that could
support resilience-building efforts. To advance and sustain
technological innovation that enhances global resilience, the STO's
Science and Technology Board should push for a sustained allocation of
funding specifically for resilience research, biomedical research and
development, and ambitious pilot programs focused on sharing pathogen
surveillance data between countries and their health systems, developing
biomedical research infrastructure, and conducting training simulations
for biothreat and public-health emergencies.

The NATO Science for Peace and Security (SPS) Programme, as defined by
the Alliance, promotes dialogue and
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** "[based on scientific research,
technological innovation, and knowledge exchange]{.underline}. \[It\]
offers funding, expert advice and support to... security-relevant
activities that respond to NATO's strategic objectives." During the
pandemic, SPS led efforts to advance the development of rapid COVID-19
tests. In the future, SPS should invest in ways to identify and combat
swiftly rising global antimicrobial resistance, synthetic biology
threats, and agricultural vulnerabilities; it
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[invest in assessments and
fortifications]{.underline}]{.mark} of medical and biosecurity
stockpiles.

The Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC) has
experience supporting responses to infectious-disease outbreaks, which
threaten to increase as a consequence of climate change,
industrialization, and global migration. EADRCC activities leverage
emerging technologies to enhance resilience and build capacities for
crisis response. Previous joint exercises with the SPS Program have
included testing innovative telemedicine and communications platforms.
EADRCC's successful logistical coordination during the COVID-19 pandemic
underscores its unique value; in the future, the EADRCC should expand
its role in international cooperation and information-sharing between
military medical services and civilian health systems.

The Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defence
(JCBRN) Centre of Excellence, a NATO military body focused on CBRN
defense advice, education, training, and exercises, can convene member
states and partners for training simulations and security activities
related to novel threats in the context of regional and global issues.
JCBRN should act on this capacity, in coordination with the Crisis
Management and Disaster Response Centre of Excellence, to ensure that
NATO member countries are prepared to combat future outbreaks and
biological events. [[Strengthening bio-preparedness efforts]{.mark}
through modeling and planning [will]{.mark} help [drive a
resilient]{.mark} crisis [response]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Established during the pandemic, the NATO Pandemic Response Trust Fund
stockpiles medical equipment and supplies for members of the Alliance
and partners in need. Beyond the current pandemic, it can help defend
against future chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and
public-health threats---only if NATO maintains and adapts these
stockpiled resources for other critical public-health and infrastructure
needs.

Looking ahead, the NATO 2030 initiative aims to elevate democratic
leadership around the world, advance
**[[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}**medical science and global technology, and
position NATO and its partners to tackle novel global security
challenges through a lens of flexibility and adaptation. Strategic
investments in these efforts will establish [**[resilient]{.underline}**
**[frameworks]{.underline}** [for addressing emerging
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}[, which is critical for successful
collective defense]{.underline}.

Realizing the full potential of these and other programs [[will
require]{.underline}]{.mark} additional
**[[support]{.underline}]{.mark}** from NATO operations, planning,
policy, and civilian divisions. [[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and
international organizations [[should]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[continue **working with NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark} on the ground to
support equipment procurement and regional needs. [In today's
unpredictable security environment, successfully responding to threats
requires resilience---and [NATO is well-positioned to make resilience a
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Bioterror ADV -- yes risk

#### Bio agents are at risk of leakage -- security measures fail, countless lab failures, no safety records

[[Vials of bioterror bacteria]{.mark} have [gone missing]{.mark}. [Lab

[escaped]{.mark}, and [wild rodents]{.mark} have been [found making
nests with research waste]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Cattle infected

A [USA TODAY Network
investigation](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/28/biolabs-pathogens-location-incidents/26587505/) reveals
that [hundreds of lab mistakes, safety violations and near-miss
incidents have occurred in biological laboratories coast to coast in
recent years, putting scientists, their colleagues and sometimes even
the public at risk.]{.underline}

Oversight [of [bio]{.mark}logical [research labs is
fragmented]{.mark}]{.underline}, often secretive [and largely
self-policing]{.underline}, the investigation found. And even when
[research facilities commit the most egregious safety or security
breaches --- as more than 100 labs have --- federal regulators keep
their names secret.]{.underline}

Of [particular concern are mishaps occurring at institutions working
with [the world\'s most dangerous pathogens in biosafety level 3 and 4
labs]{.mark}]{.underline} --- the two highest levels of containment that
have proliferated since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. [Yet [there is
no publicly available list of these labs]{.mark}, and [the scope of
their research and safety records are largely unknown to most state
health departments charged with responding to disease
outbreaks]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Even the federal government
doesn\'t know where they all are, the Government Accountability Office
has warned for years.

#### Terrorists biotech expertise is up, bioterrorism likely to increase, a lab breach could cause mass spread of viruses

**Piper, staff writer for vox and Stanford grad, 4-5-22,**

\[Kelsey, 4-5-22, Vox, "Why experts are terrified of a human-made
pandemic --- and what we can do to stop it,"

["The fact is that [lab]{.mark}oratory [accidents]{.mark} [are]{.mark}
[not rare in life sciences]{.mark},"]{.underline} former Sen. Joe
Lieberman told the bipartisan Commission on Biodefense [this
March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvjNbayZHxY). "[[As]{.mark}
countries throughout the world build additional
[lab]{.mark}oratorie[s]{.mark} to [conduct research on highly infectious
and deadly pathogens, it's clear]{.mark} that the pace of
[lab]{.mark}oratory [accidents will naturally
increase.]{.mark}]{.underline}

According to [research published last
year](https://schar.gmu.edu/news/2021-07/new-interactive-map-reveals-where-deadliest-germs-are-studied) by
King's College London biosecurity researchers Gregory Koblentz and
Filippa Lentzos, [[there are now nearly 60 labs classified as
BSL-4]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the highest biosecurity rating, for labs
authorized to carry out work with the most dangerous pathogens ---
either in operation, under construction, or planned in 23 different
countries[. At least 20 of those labs have been built in the last
decade, and [more than 75 percent are located in urban centers where a
lab escape could quickly spread.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Alongside [the near certainty that there will be more lab escapes in the
future, [engineering]{.mark} the [viruses]{.mark} that [could
conceivably cause a pandemic]{.mark} if they escaped is [getting cheaper
and easier]{.mark}.]{.underline} That means it's [now possible for a
single lab]{.mark} or small group [to conceivably cause mass
destruction]{.mark} [across the whole world, [either deliberately or by
accident.]{.underline}]{.mark}

["[Potential large-scale]{.mark} effects of attempted
[bioterrorism]{.mark} [have been mitigated]{.mark} in the [past by
terrorists' lack of expertis]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}, and the
inherent challenge of using biotechnology to make and release dangerous
pathogens[. Now, as people gain greater access to this technology and it
becomes easier to use, the challenge is easing,"]{.underline}
Pavel [argues](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/article/facing-the-future-of-bioterrorism/).
The result? "[[Incidents of bioterrorism soon will become more
prevalent."]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Bioterrorism is hard to track but has incredible capacity for destruction

**Tin et al.,** Department of Emergency Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, USA, ,** 22** (Derrick Tin,
Pardis Sabeti, and Gregory Ciottone, 2-6-2022, PubMed Central
(PMC), \"Bioterrorism: An analysis of biological agents used in
terrorist
events\", https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8818129/, accessed
on 7-6-2022, PubMed Central (PMC), ,FLC )

[The reported use of biological agents as a terrorist weapon is
extremely rare and accounts for 0.02% of all historic terrorist
attacks]{.underline} \[9,10\]. Despite its apparent rarity, however,
[[bioterrorism has the ability to inflict mass injuries unmatched by
conventional weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} (mean injury rate of
explosives in terrorist attacks = 4./event vs 28.8/event in biological
attacks) \[9\]. [[Moreover,]{.mark} given the surreptitious nature of
these attacks, **[they are more likely to go unreported than
conventional weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Research into personal
biological threat sensors and advanced bioprotective suits are currently
underway, but questions remain in the medical preparedness to respond to
bioterrorism events \[11\]. [The recent [Covid19]{.mark} pandemic has
[exposed significant flaws in biocontainment, disease screening and
surveillance, mobilisation of personal protective equipment, medical
surge capacities and vaccine countermeasures to
biothreat]{.mark}s]{.underline}. It has also revealed the complexities
around crisis leadership and public education, as evidenced by the
inconsistent implementation of and adherence to nonpharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs), and [global vaccine hesitancy and inequities, [all
of which could be exploited in the planning of a bioterrorism
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the origins of Covid19 remains
inconclusive, there has been much debate around the use of modern-day
technology to manipulate existing agents or create novel biothreats
\[12\].

Synthetic biology emerged in the 1960s (though it was first coined in
the 1910\'s) but the past decade has seen an explosion of interest,
activity and advances in this scientific field \[13\]. Today, it
encompasses specialties such as biotechnology, genetic engineering,
molecular biology and biological, electrical and computer engineering
\[14\]. Advances in genetic engineering such as CRISPR technology (often
considered to be the most important recent innovation in this field) in
particular, has significantly fuelled the growth of synthetic biology
\[15\]. The ability to rapidly edit gene sequences without the need for
highly sophisticated and expensive equipment in an institutionalized
environment has raised significant concerns around biohacking, a growing
biotechnological movement in which individuals can experiment and create
entire genomes from scratch (including those of lethal pathogens) with
little-to-no safety oversight. Do-it-yourself (DIY) home CRISPR kits
already exist on the market today \[16\].

While the Biological Weapons Convention established in 1975 prohibits
the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use
of biological and toxin weapons by the 183 states (as of September 2021)
that have ratified and acceded the treaty, [[little can stop rogue
actors or terrorist organisations from]{.mark} harnessing existing or
[creating novel biothreats using]{.mark} the [tech]{.mark}nology
[available today]{.mark}]{.underline} \[17\]. [[Security concerns range
from increasing the lethality or ease of transmission]{.mark} of
biological agents [to developing novel delivery methods that can
overcome preventative vaccine measures]{.mark} \[18\].]{.underline}

Much has been learned since the beginning of the Covid19 pandemic and
expert suggestions in addressing [future biothreats include elevating
infectious diseases as potential threats to national security,
maintaining funding and support to biological research, public health
and biological surveillance programs, maintaining medical workforce
readiness and improving cross-country collaborations and communication
\[1]{.underline}9\].

Bioterrorism highlights the importance of specialist knowledge needed in
the field of Counter-Terrorism Medicine (CTM), a subspecialist field of
Disaster Medicine (DM). CTM experts need to remain vigilant in
anticipating novel attack methodologies that can threaten healthcare
system infrastructures and provide solutions in mitigating the
healthcare risks of such attacks. Robust CTM education should be
incorporated into traditional DM teachings, as well as emergency
medical, nursing and pre-hospital medicine curriculums in an effort to
heighten awareness and enhance medical preparedness to future
intentional, man-made attacks.

[The [GTD is a comprehensive record of]{.mark} documented [global
terrorist events]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is maintained by the National
Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, [[and
is the basis for other terrorism-related measures, such as the
GTI]{.underline}]{.mark}. Reliance wholly on the GTD is partially
mitigated by confirmation with other lay sources, and searches for other
online searches, [[but if there are incidents not reported]{.mark} in
the GTD, [this could limit the veracity of the
findings]{.mark}]{.underline}. [F[urthermore, the lack of a universally
agreed-upon definition of the term terrorism can create inconsistencies
between databases in the labelling of such events]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Clear and detailed documentation of terrorist events is further hindered
by restrictions on reporting, the lack of independent corroboration and
the lack of transparency within certain government sources.
Infrastructure needed to report, detect and identify biological agents
is likely lacking in many parts of the world leading to potential under
reporting of events. The greater number reported in the United States
may be due to greater scrutiny of potential events. Event descriptions
as provided by the GTD rely mostly on grey literature sources and as
such accuracy is only limited to those sources.

[[Bioterro]{.mark}rism attacks [have been]{.mark} historically [rare but
have the ability to inflict large-scale, mass casualty
events]{.mark}]{.underline}. Anthrax has been most commonly used in
previous bioterrorism events with the vast majority of reported attacks
occurring in the United States by a single suspected perpetrator[. With
[new advances in microbiology and synthetic biology]{.mark}, it [is
becoming increasingly possible for individual or small groups of rogue
actors to develop and disseminate advanced
bioweapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the Covid19 pandemic has likely
raised the awareness levels of first responders to biothreats, it has
also exposed response and preparedness vulnerabilities in the healthcare
sector. Counter-Terrorism Medicine and Disaster Medicine specialists
need to be proactive in delivering ongoing educational sessions on
biological events to first responder communities, and anticipate
emerging novel biotechnology threats.

### China ADV -- China rising fast

#### China advancing 6 times faster than US in biotech

**Cancherini et al.,** MIT SLoan Grad, ,** 21** (Laura Cancherini,
Joseph Lydon, Jorge Santos da Silva, and Alexandra Zemp,
4-30-2021, McKinsey & Company, \"What's ahead for biotech: Another wave
or low
tide?\", https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/whats-ahead-for-biotech-another-wave-or-low-tide, accessed
on 7-6-2022, McKinsey & Company, ,FLC )

Unlike most industries in these extraordinarily challenging times,
[[biotech is experiencing a high]{.underline}]{.mark}. Executives in
many other sectors are becoming more pessimistic about the outlook for
their businesses as the global pandemic continues to spread. 1 1.
McKinsey interviewed more than 2,000 executives from multiple sectors in
October 2020. The majority believed that the global public-health
response to COVID-19 would be partly effective but with regional
resurgence and that economic interventions would be partly effective or
ineffective. But the search to understand and find treatment or
preventive solutions to COVID-19 has focused intense government, media,
and public attention on science and medicine, reinforcing the perception
that biotech acquisitions and partnerships represent a good investment.

In an effort to understand worldwide biotech financing in the context of
the COVID-19 crisis, McKinsey analyzed the sector's financial
performance and interviewed 20 C-level executives from small and midsize
biotechs and venture-capital (VC) firms.

[[The pandemic has had an enormous financial impact on many sectors, but
biotech has weathered the storm]{.underline}]{.mark}: after a brief
downturn early in the crisis, it recovered quickly (Exhibit 1). Between
January 2020 and January 2021, the [[average share price for European
and US biotechs increased at more than twice the rate of the S&P
500]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[Chinese biotechs performed more than six
times better, with]{.mark} their [average share price more than
doubli]{.mark}ng [in a year.]{.mark}]{.underline} Overall, biotech is
outperforming its sister industry, pharmaceuticals, as well as many
household-name consumer-goods and technology companies.

### China ADV -- A2 coop not competition

#### China explicitly wants to compete, not cooperate

Rob **Carlson and** Rik **Wehbring '20**, "TWO WORLDS TWO BIOECONOMIES,"
National Security Report, JOHNS HOPKINS
https://www.jhuapl.edu/Content/documents/Carlson_Wehbring-Biotech.pdf

[The government of [China has **explicitly** described its intent to
**dominate the global stage**]{.mark} in the twenty-first century
[through biotech]{.mark}nology [and has been working to]{.mark}
implement associated [long-term strategic goals]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While [[China has a **multidecadal vision**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
has informed its strategy and has subsequently been implemented using
various tactics, the United States has no similar long-term vision and
has exhibited no coordinated response to Chinese actions. In this paper,
we do not address this larger issue. Instead, we examine one particular
strategy---decoupling--- to lay the groundwork for further policy
analysis. In particular, we describe the current environment (size and
composition of US and Chinese revenues from biotechnology) and the
interdependence of biotechnology in the two countries and then offer a
first review of how some decoupling mechanisms might unfold. We also
examine the strategic risk that decoupling may pose to each country in
the context of accelerating, and compounding, learning rates in
biological engineering.

#### China versus US battle over biotech is zero-sum

**Adrien '19** (Claudia Adrien, 11/21/2019, reporter who previous
covered biosecurity, "Chinese biotechnology dominates U.S. Senate

6/27/2022

[[China is rapidly gaining on the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [when
it comes to]{.mark} creating technology that mitigates disease threats
and [developing pharmaceuticals]{.mark} faster]{.underline}, and it's a
phenomenon driven by a philosophy that the state, military, and the
private sector are one in the same.

That was the testimony of Tara J. O'Toole, senior fellow and executive
vice president at In-Q-Tel, before the U.S. Senate Armed Services
Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. [The
hearing]{.underline}, Biological Threats to U.S. National Security,
[examined everything from [China's push to develop biotechnology
infrastructure to **luring research scientists away from the United
States** to work in China.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["[China has said repeatedly and forcefully]{.mark}, and they're backing
up their words with actions, [that they intend to own the
biorevolution]{.mark}," O'Toole said. "And [they are building the
infrastructure, the talent pipeline, the regulatory system, and the
financial system they need]{.mark} to do that."]{.underline}

[China is partly accomplishing this by combining its internet giants,
such as Alibaba, with its biotech companies. The combined strength of
these companies' research focuses on the industrialization of artificial
intelligence in which [China is "institutionalizing it" whereas the
United States is only "experimenting with it,"]{.mark}]{.underline}
O'Toole added.

[[China's goal is to make biotechnology 5 percent of the country's GDP
by 2020. China has changed regulations]{.mark} for its own version of
the Food and Drug Administration [to be more like]{.mark} that of
[the]{.mark} [United States]{.mark} in order to more easily market to
the world. [The country has created a **talent pipeline** that
incentivizes its]{.mark} own [students to go into the life sciences and
bioengineering.]{.mark} [China]{.mark} also [has at least]{.mark} [**20
programs** intended to bring scientific talent from the rest of the
world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### China ADV -- Hegemony solvency

#### The time is now for the US to counter China's rise in the biotech sector to maintain tech hegemony

As a result of the political measures adopted from a very early stage by
the Chinese central authorities in order to regulate and guide foreign
direct investment in accordance with the country's own strategies for
the modernisation of the biotechnological sector and, later on, direct
Chinese outward direct investment in accordance with the same national
interests, correlated with the sustained efforts made over the recent
years for the creation of a knowledge-based economy, [**China**
gradually **reduced the gap** that was separating it from the
technological frontier, and became one of the **main competitors** in
the race for global supremacy in the field of
**biotech**nology]{.underline}. As such, in addition to an ample direct
support for research programmes and initiatives in the field, the
Chinese government applied [a sustained and gradual policy seeking to
encourage the entry on the Chinese market of large transnational biotech
corporations]{.underline} ([U.S. companies in particular]{.underline})
and the relocation of their production on the local market, coupled with
the adoption of measures meant to stimulate national companies to merge
with and acquire U.S. companies in the field. Over the recent years,
[the **competition** between China and the U.S. in the field of
biotechnology has become **fierce,**]{.underline} and the U.S. officials
are not sparing any efforts in claiming China's advance with regard to
the development of emerging technologies in critical sectors. [This may
be true in certain fields, but not in the biotechnology
sector]{.underline}, for now. Certainly, Chinese biotechnological
industries are evolving at an accelerated pace, and some companies
become leaders on certain market sub-segments (e.g. cancer treatment),
but nevertheless, [the U.S. holds the dominant position in the
research-development-marketing activities based on the significant
results assimilated]{.underline} in a period of over a decade
(2000-2013) in which they held almost half of the total number of
patents submitted in the field of biotechnology worldwide.
[Biotechnology is a **critical** aspect **in** the **tech**nological
**competition** between the U.S. and China]{.underline}, because based
on its complexity and multidisciplinary nature, this sophisticated
discipline has the capacity to transform in an interchanging way two
essential fields: medicine applications and uses that are generally the
prerogative of a military power. To exemplify more clearly, as shown by
the history of the 20th century, the evolution of discoveries in physics
enabled the understanding and use of nuclear reactions to produce
energy; however, the same scientific principles were later used for the
production of nuclear weapons. [Biotechnology offers a similar mix of
promises and dangers]{.underline}. For example, the discovery of the
CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme system (which was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2020)
enables the highly precise encryption of a body's genome, which makes it
a transforming discovery. However, while CRISPR is very promising for
the development of innovating treatments for certain conditions that
have long been considered untreatable, it could also lead to the
production of a new generation of lethal biological weapons. [**China's
determination** to become a **global power in** the field of
**biotech**nology is reflected in the unequalled level of government
support, in the minute development of roadmaps for each stage of
evolution, in the design of policies for incentivising the attraction of
high-quality talents]{.underline} (regardless of nationality), as well
as in the creation of a national ecosystem that favours innovation.
Since the period when Deng Xiaoping was leading the country, China has
started an ample transition process which enabled it to shift from the
status of an "imitator" of developed nations to that of an innovating
country. Concomitantly with this transition, biotechnology applications
extended to extremely diverse fields such as: medicine, industry,
agriculture, energy and environmental protection. Despite the persistent
delays noted in the production of medical devices, [China has reached
its goal being today among the world leaders in the field of genome
editing, immune therapy, cell therapy and the integration of information
technology in medicine]{.underline}.

Chinese government applied [a sustained and gradual policy seeking to
encourage the entry on the Chinese market of large transnational biotech
corporations]{.underline} ([U.S. companies in particular]{.underline})
and the relocation of their production on the local market, coupled with
the adoption of measures meant to stimulate national companies to merge
with and acquire U.S. companies in the field. Over the recent years,
[the [competition]{.mark} between China and the U.S. in the field of
biotechnology [has become **fierce**]{.mark},]{.underline} and the U.S.
officials are not sparing any efforts in claiming China's advance with
regard to the development of emerging technologies in critical sectors.
[This may be true in certain fields, but not in the biotechnology
sector]{.underline}, for now. Certainly, Chinese biotechnological
industries are evolving at an accelerated pace, and some companies
become leaders on certain market sub-segments (e.g. cancer treatment),
but nevertheless, the U.S. holds the dominant position in the
research-development-marketing activities based on the significant
results assimilated in a period of over a decade (2000-2013) in which
they held almost half of the total number of patents submitted in the
field of biotechnology worldwide. **[[Biotech]{.mark}nology [is]{.mark}
a [critical]{.mark} aspect [in]{.mark} the [tech]{.mark}nological
[competition]{.mark}]{.underline}** between the U.S. and China, because
based on its complexity and multidisciplinary nature, this sophisticated
discipline has the capacity to transform in an interchanging way two
essential fields: medicine applications and uses that are generally the
prerogative of a military power. To exemplify more clearly, as shown by
the history of the 20th century, the evolution of discoveries in physics
enabled the understanding and use of nuclear reactions to produce
energy; however, the same scientific principles were later used for the
production of nuclear weapons. [Biotechnology offers a similar mix of
promises and dangers]{.underline}. For example, the discovery of the
CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme system (which was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2020)
enables the highly precise encryption of a body's genome, which makes it
a transforming discovery. However, while CRISPR is very promising for
the development of innovating treatments for certain conditions that
have long been considered untreatable, it could also lead to the
production of a new generation of lethal biological weapons. [**[China's
determination]{.mark}** [to become]{.mark} a [global]{.mark} power
**[in]{.mark}** the field of **[biotech]{.mark}**nology [is
reflected]{.mark} in the unequalled level of government support, in the
minute development of roadmaps for each stage of evolution, in the
design of policies for incentivising the attraction of high-quality
talents]{.underline} (regardless of nationality), as well as in the
creation of a national ecosystem that favours innovation. Since the
period when Deng Xiaoping was leading the country, China has started an
ample transition process which enabled it to shift from the status of an
"imitator" of developed nations to that of an innovating country.
Concomitantly with this transition, biotechnology applications extended
to extremely diverse fields such as: medicine, industry, agriculture,
energy and environmental protection. Despite the persistent delays noted
in the production of medical devices, [China has reached its goal being
today among the world leaders in the field of genome editing, immune
therapy, cell therapy and the integration of information technology in
medicine]{.underline}.

### Europe ADV -- backsliding now

#### Europe is at major risk of autocratization -- most nuanced understanding of data supports

Staffan I. **Lindberg '18**, July 4, the director of the Varieties of
Democracy (V-Dem) Institute and professor of political science at the
University of Gothenburg. "The Nature of Democratic Backsliding in
Europe," CARNEGIE EUROPE,
https://carnegieeurope.eu/2018/07/24/nature-of-democratic-backsliding-in-europe-pub-76868

The level of [democracy in Europe remains]{.underline} close to [its
highest]{.underline} level ever recorded. Albania, for example, recently
transitioned into a liberal democracy. **[Yet]{.underline}**, as in
other parts of the globe, [**[substantial autocratization]{.mark}** over
the last ten years [may threaten the future viability of democracy in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Several]{.mark} countries have recently
[backslid]{.mark} from liberal to electoral democracies, and
[authoritarian rule is increasing]{.mark}ly recorded in
others]{.underline}. This backsliding occurs primarily in media and
civil society---non-electoral soft spots of democracy where governments
can limit democratic space with less immediate scrutiny.

[The [subtlety and variation]{.mark} across different components of
democracy [needs to be fully understood to]{.mark} correctly [address
the challenge]{.mark} to democracy in Europe]{.underline}. Electoral
institutions and practices remain robust (or are even improving). It is
media freedom, freedom of expression and alternative sources of
information, and the rule of law that are being undermined in a
significant number of countries.

These disquieting conclusions fit political scientist Nancy Bermeo's
observation that "[the most [blatant forms of backsliding" are
disappearing]{.mark} while **[surreptitious tactics]{.mark}** such as
harassment of the opposition and subversion of horizontal accountability
[are on the rise]{.mark}]{.underline}: "Elected executives weaken checks
on executive power one by one . . . \[and\] hamper the power of
opposition forces to challenge executive preferences."4

Both **[[negative and positive trends are observed at the same
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is important to recognize that [the
"democraticness" of European society is under strain]{.underline}.
Placed in the wider sweep of time, [[the]{.mark} current [situation is
**not yet**]{.mark} as bad as previous moments of
**[crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}; European democracy still scores well
across most indicators compared to the 1970s. Tremulous times are
nothing new. [Yet recent developments most certainly give room for
pause]{.underline}.

V-Dem's 2017 democracy report concluded that democracy still seems
relatively resilient.5 This year, [the assessment is]{.underline} more
**[pessimistic]{.underline}**. **[[Democracy is being rolled
back]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A trend of autocratization is
evident]{.underline}. The starkest difference from last year is the
number of [very large and powerful nations]{.underline} that
[are]{.underline} now [part of the autocratization wave, affecting
billions of people and sending a very strong signal to the rest of the
world]{.underline}.

### Europe ADV -- A2 U.S. could do it alone

#### U.S. advances pay off bigger through NATO

W. Bruce **Weinrod '16**, January 15, "We Still Need NATO," THE AMERICAN
INTEREST,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/01/15/we-still-need-nato/

[Not only does [NATO]{.mark} remain relevant, but more importantly it
[continues to support and advance U.S]{.mark}. security
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}---though again, often in ways that do
not make headlines and that casual observers rarely appreciate in full.
Most fundamentally, [[NATO provides a standing multilateral military
capability that can deter or be deployed]{.mark} should a significant
security threat arise]{.underline}. [Because [NATO has]{.mark} a
military capability in place, [the core elements for mobilization,
deployment, and sustainment]{.mark} of substantial multilateral military
forces already exist. The **[ongoing]{.mark}** training, exercises, and
regular communication among the national militaries of NATO members
allows them to jump-start **[preparations]{.mark}** and actions when
needed without very lengthy preparatory work. This [can allow the
U.S.]{.mark} government [to proceed in]{.mark} shaping and
[leading]{.mark} military [coalitions]{.mark} more [quickly]{.mark}, at
less cost and [with greater effectiveness]{.mark}, than if NATO did not
exist and its functional equivalent had to be invented from scratch at a
moment's notice]{.underline}. While the U.S. government retains the
capacity and the right to act unilaterally if and when necessary, it
makes sense for it to act with others whenever possible, whether through
NATO or ad hoc coalitions of the willing. [A multilateral framework can
provide both political cover and military resources, and the United
States very much can benefit from both]{.underline}.

[The United States also benefits significantly from **[NATO's logistics
capabilities]{.mark}**. Pontificating about grand strategies sounds
impressive, but for military effectiveness and success, **logistics
capabilities are what [really count]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example,
while NATO did not formally participate in the 1991 Gulf War, NATO
resources, supplies, bases, and other infrastructure provided crucial
support prior to and during the U.S.-led coalition military action to
force Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. The coalition in effect borrowed
NATO capacities already in existence, and benefitted greatly from
equipment compatibility and common training and resources. Other
coalitions of the willing assembled under U.S auspices and utilizing
NATO resources can follow the same approach.

### Europe ADV -- A2 NATO is crappy

#### U.S. coop picks NATO up

W. Bruce **Weinrod '16**, January 15, "We Still Need NATO," THE AMERICAN
INTEREST,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/01/15/we-still-need-nato/

[[Essential for NATO effectiveness is renewed U.S. leadership]{.mark}
both [at NATO]{.mark} and globally]{.underline}. The Obama
Administration has been reactive, content for the United States to act
as merely one among equals, and has also downgraded the U.S.
relationship with NATO. A striking example occurred in March of last
year, when NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg requested a meeting
with the President, as is traditional for NATO Secretary Generals when
they visit Washington, well in advance of his arrival. Yet even though
Stoltenberg was to be Washington for several days, he was told that no
meeting could be arranged. [NATO requires strong U.S. leadership to be
truly effective and it has always been the case that when the United
States does lead at NATO others follow. This also necessarily means
reinforcing the U.S. military presence in the European
theater]{.underline}.

While there are some encouraging signs regarding NATO's response to
Russia, [[it remains to be seen whether NATO]{.mark}'s members
[will]{.mark} take the necessary steps to [ensure]{.mark} its military
[effectiveness over time]{.mark}]{.underline}. If recent Russian
adventurism does not stimulate a rethink of recent trends, NATO could
eventually hollow itself out and become of marginal value to the United
States. The eventual result would be a serious reassessment of U.S.
involvement in NATO, and would play to the advantage of those who wish
the United States to renounce its role as provider of common global
security goods. The argument would predictably run as follows: We cannot
afford to do this alone and be effective at it, so let's not try to do
it at all.

The next NATO Summit to be held in Warsaw this July provides an
opportunity for NATO nations to formally commit themselves to continuing
NATO's adaptation to contemporary security threats. In addition to
mandating the enhancements described above, NATO should promulgate a
common unifying vision that can be understood and supported by both
policymakers and the general publics of NATO nations. Given the reality
that NATO comprises a community of democratic nations, NATO should
highlight its role as the focal point of a global democratic security
network that embodies both a shield and, where necessary, a sword, not
only ensuring this community's security but also safeguarding its shared
democratic values. The United States, for its part, should take the lead
at this Summit in developing and implementing NATO's continuing
adaptation. This means leading from the front while not only halting but
also reversing the downgrading of U.S. military capabilities in Europe.

After playing a key role in the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO has
transformed itself into a multi-mission organization addressing
21st-century security challenges while adding new members, establishing
global security relationships, and responding to Russian adventurism.
NATO has thus demonstrated in the post-Cold War era that it is an
organization with the capacity to adapt and even to reinvent itself.
But, as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates put it a few years ago,
[[there remains a]{.underline}]{.mark} "real [[possibility
of]{.underline}]{.mark} **[collective military
[irrelevance]{.mark}]{.underline}**" if NATO fails to address current
military deficiencies.

[[Only]{.mark} strong [U.S. leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has
been absent in recent years, [[can **catalyze and organize**]{.mark}
that **[revival]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Perhaps beginning in January
2017 we will again see that kind of leadership.

A World of Biological Possibilities. [Mutual]{.underline}
[self-interest]{.underline} [provides a strong basis for transatlantic
cooperation]{.underline} [in biotechnology]{.underline} [based on shared
recognition of its vast potential to provide solutions to some of
civilization's most pressing problems]{.underline}. Thanks to [explosive
advances]{.underline} [in our understanding]{.underline} of the many
ways in which promiscuous nature has been manipulating DNA and RNA for
the past billion years[, it is widely anticipated that the 21st century
will belong to biology]{.underline}.1 [We are now at the point where our
ability to innovate is constrained less by technical capability than by
the limits of our imaginations]{.underline}. Multiple laboratories and
companies on both sides of the Atlantic (and throughout the world) are
pursuing promising applications, and experience confirms progress would
be accelerated by cooperative approaches. [But there are some
considerable challenges, especially in agricultural and industrial
contexts]{.underline}. The most important rate-limiting factor in our
ability to harness biological innovations to the challenges of feeding
the world, sustaining human and environmental health, and addressing
climate change, is the burden imposed by ill-considered regulations.
Unless this bottleneck can be unblocked, the enormous potential for
transatlantic scientific cooperation will not yield the necessary
fruits. Divergent Regulatory Paths: Precaution vs. Openness to
Innovation. [Existing policies]{.underline}, [legislation]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [regulations]{.underline} [do little or nothing to
advance human or environmental safety]{.underline}.2 Born out of
understandable caution at the dawn of recombinant DNA technologies,
today their most obvious impact is to obstruct and discourage research,
development, and deployment of innovative solutions to various
challenges.3 This is so despite an abundant record of production and
consumption of new biotech products with enviable records of improved
safety, superior sustainability, and widespread beneficial economic
impacts.4 The benefits are so substantial that a pattern has emerged of
farmers breaking the law to acquire and plant improved seeds in
countries where governments have lagged in allowing access.5 It is one
thing to implement policies and regulations ostensibly designed to
ensure safety; it is quite another to ignore vast data and decades of
experience around the world to maintain obsolete policies and
regulations that add nothing to safety or sustainability, but only
impede our ability to use the most innovative, precise, and safest tools
to address our gravest challenges.6 In terms of regulatory policy and
openness to biological innovations, the width of the Atlantic might be
measured better in light years than miles or kilometers. As imperfect as
regulations for the products of biotechnology are in North America, they
are simply indefensible in Europe.7 The United States decided in 1986,
after years of study and consultation, that no new laws were required to
ensure the safety of crops and foods improved through biotechnology.
This was based on the finding that they present no novel hazards, and
foreseeable risks of their development and use fall into categories with
which humans have considerable experience from millennia of conventional
plant and animal breeding.8 The United States therefore decided to
regulate these novel products under existing authorities administered by
the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and
Environmental Protection Agency.9 While implementation of this policy,
the "Coordinated Framework," has been far from perfect, it has been
sufficiently predictable and science-based to enable an explosion of
innovation, new product development, and commercial activity.
Consequently, the United States has led the world to the present day
wherein crops improved through biotechnology are now the global standard
for quality seeds, delivering improved yields, safety, sustainability,
and economic productivity around the world, with the lion's share of
benefits accruing on behalf of small farmers in developing countries.10
Europe took a different approach. It is one thing to implement policies
and regulations ostensibly designed to ensure safety; it is quite
another to ignore vast data and decades of experience around the world
to maintain obsolete policies and regulations that add nothing to safety
or sustainability. The European Union decided to regulate seeds improved
through biotechnology as a novel class governed under new regulations
specifically focused on an arbitrary category known as "GMOs" (for
"genetically modified organisms"). The conceit was that because they
represented gene combinations produced by mechanisms supposedly "not
found in nature" (but actually ubiquitous) they must present novel
hazards, even though none has ever been identified. These putatively
novel hazards, despite the lack of any concrete manifestations,
allegedly required dedicated, specific, "precautionary" regulations. The
resulting regulatory regime proved so burdensome it led to the general
collapse of agricultural biotechnology in Europe, which had played a
leading role in its discovery and invention. Permissions for field
trials proved almost impossible to obtain, products could not be
developed and brought to market, academic labs abandoned the field, and
the industry relocated most of its assets and activities to the
Americas. And Europe became the world's largest importer of commodity
foods improved through biotechnology, only recently surpassed by China.
**[[Opportunity for Transatlantic Cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Many scientists in the EU (and around the world) knew from the beginning
that this was the wrong approach, yet the EU pushed its model
internationally, with aggressive diplomacy, leading to emulation by many
countries in the developing world, with equally unhappy results to those
seen in Europe.11 But a growing number of scientists, policymakers, and
even "green" NGOs that had originally opposed GMOs, now recognize the
counterproductive results of this approach and are working to avoid
repeating the same mistakes with gene editing. This shines a spotlight
on [the most important and potentially [fruitful]{.mark}
[opportunity]{.mark} [for]{.mark} transatlantic [cooperation in
biotechnology]{.mark}]{.underline}: **[[the revival of science-based
regulatory]{.mark} [regimes]{.mark} in which the degree of regulatory
oversight is proportional to the hazards involved]{.underline}, [and
[regulation that enables]{.mark}]{.underline}, [rather than
discourages]{.underline}** **[[the safe development of innovative
products]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A return to and reaffirmation of these
first principles would provide fertile ground for cooperation and
coordination globally. [[Regulatory reform]{.underline}]{.mark}
([everywhere]{.underline}, not just in the EU and its emulators, though
the need is greatest there) [[provides fertile ground for transatlantic
cooperation and coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}. [We have robust
models of proven approaches]{.underline}.12 **[[Without such
cooperation]{.mark}, [other progress in developing and deploying
innovative solutions through biotechnology will be]{.mark} [impeded or
foregone]{.mark}]{.underline}.** As to national security risks, just as
with other risks, novelty attributable to biotechnology is elusive.
**[One can do very nasty things with conventional
bioweapons]{.underline}**, **[and they are easily magnified with
recombinant DNA techniques]{.underline}**. [At the same time,
**defensive capacities are also buttressed by
biotechnology**]{.underline}, [as demonstrated by the rapid development
of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2]{.underline}. There has been some
good work done in this area, but [this **topic is worth exploring at
greater depth**]{.underline}. **[The OECD has a track record of
thoughtful analyses with such topics]{.underline}**. **[One possibility
would be to build on that foundation by establishing a joint OECD/NATO
working group to serve as a forum]{.underline}.**

Ehlert, head of Strategy and Policy in the Office of the Chief Scientist

Date Accessed 7-7-22) -JVK

Setting norms -- a role for NATO? [Emerging and Disruptive Technologies
(EDTs) came into NATO's political focus in 2019, when NATO leaders
adopted an implementation]{.underline} roadmap for seven such
technologies. Regardless of their tremendous promise, we must realise
that these technologies [are not yet mature, not yet "fully out
there]{.underline}". Therefore, [considerable uncertainty remains to
which extent these fledgling technologies and their foreseeable
applications are appropriately contained within established legal,
ethical, and moral norms]{.underline}. These questions are not limited
to military applications, nor do they stop at national borders: rather,
they cut across many government departments and business sectors, and
they affect humanity in its entirety. In this complex, fast moving,
high-stake setting, we must view technology and values as intertwined.
While our values should guide our use of technology, we must recognise
that our technology choices will, whether intended or not, reflect the
values we adhere to. As inaction is not an option, we must take active
measures to establish norms for the future use of technologies; norms
that are deeply rooted in our values; technologies that are currently
emerging and have recognised disruption potential (such as AI,
biotechnology, and quantum technology). How could we realistically
master this novel challenge? The following three proposals could pave
the way. We must effectively cope with the uncertainties of technology
evolution. Hence, I suggest evolutionary policy-making, building on
current knowledge, but flexible enough so that today's decisions can be
adjusted or corrected in the future. We must strive to limit potential
harm without unduly constraining the benefits a technology can bring.
Therefore, our policies should set limits for the application of
technologies (such as genetically optimised super-soldiers) rather than
banning entire technology areas (in this case, biotechnology). We need
to understand when policy changes are necessary and what those changes
should be. Reflecting the diversity of interests, [we need to
institutionalise a broad stakeholder engagement that reaches out to all
parties affected by a technology and influencing its evolution. Within
this broadly applicable framing, NATO's role is specific. As the
international organisation committed to defence and security in the
North Atlantic area, it convenes considerable political, military,
economic, and technological power. Building in particular on its
political and intellectual capital, the Alliance can credibly spearhead
norm setting for technology applications in defence to comply with
Western values]{.underline}. With its recently published AI Strategy,
[NATO fulfils its traditional role in an innovative way]{.underline}.
This Strategy embraces principles of responsible use, which express the
value-driven norms that NATO and its member nations will adhere to in
the application of AI. By making these principles public, they set an
example for other nations to consider and potentially adopt NATO's
principles. [This is an effective approach towards proposing and
gradually implementing an international norm]{.underline}, not unlike
the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. At the same,
[NATO responds to the globally distributed innovation
landscape]{.underline}. The NATO2030 initiative highlights the need to
forge new coalitions with likeminded partners beyond the North-Atlantic
region. This broad outreach should not only extend to governmental
organisations, it should in general expand the types of partners to
collaborate with (even within Allied nations), to include
non-governmental organisations, the private sector, academia, and civil
society.

### 2AC DAs -- USFG link uniqueness

#### Pentagon already focused on biotech

**Lui and Liao '20** (Jingyuan Liu and Kai Liao, Ph.D. at Indiana
University School of Medicine, couldn't find other person, 12/17/2020,
"Biotechnology: the Pentagon's next big thing,
<https://blog.oup.com/2020/12/biotechnology-the-pentagons-next-big-thing/>)
6/25/2022

[[Biotech]{.mark}nology [has]{.mark} long [been an important field of
scientific research]{.mark}]{.underline}. But until recently, it has
never been formally considered by any military as a significant
technological investment opportunity, or a technology that could
revolutionize the conduct of war. For example, the Pentagon's Defense
Science Board (DSB), that helped then Secretary of Defense Harold Brown
identify technologies central to the second offset strategy in 1976, and
helped then deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work identify AI as the
key for the third offset strategy in 2014, explicitly opted not to
include biological threats in its analysis of known surprises in 2009.
Neither did it include biotechnology in the list of key investment
opportunities to avoid surprise in 2013.

However, [[recent studies]{.mark} by the DSB and the National Security
Commission on AI (NSCAI[) indicate]{.mark} that [the Pentagon]{.mark}
has changed its mind. It [is now preparing for a new biotech
revolution]{.mark} in military affairs (RMA), or a new offset strategy,
in order [to win the long-term strategic competition with
China]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In contrast to its previous studies, [the DSB's latest report published
in September concludes that, "the threats and [opportunities presented
by new bio-enabled capabilities will be significant,]{.mark} and [the
DoD must ensure it does not fall behind other nations]{.mark} lest it
lose its technological edge to competitors in a field that may play a
transformational role."]{.underline} Following the study's
recommendations, the DoD established an Assistant Director for
Biotechnology in 2019. The NSCAI went so far as to argue that, "the
combination of advances in AI and biology have the potential to reshape
the global economy for the next century." It [reached a similar
conclusion that China's weaponization of biology would pose a
significant threat to US national security. And biotechnology would be
central to the future geostrategic competition.]{.underline}

[Drawing on the "first offset" and "second offset" strategies, the
forthcoming offset strategy is working under the assumption that a
combination of AI and biotech might actually transform the conduct of
war. [This strategy]{.mark}, in essence, will be an effort to [build on
US's]{.mark} own [enduring]{.mark} [strengths and exploit China's
enduring weaknesses]{.mark} and vulnerabilities. The following measures
are likely to be employed for this military-technical
competition.]{.underline}

[First, [marshalling international partnerships to develop a strategic
technology plan to compete with China]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Michael
Brown and William Perry did in the 1970s, the Pentagon will identify the
most demanding operational challenges the US and its allies would face
in a conventional war versus China, and develop a strategic technology
plan to support this offset strategy. [[Allies and partners is one of
the US's key advantages over China.]{.mark} The US has been creating a
coalition of coalitions, or a system of systems with its allies to
compete with China. NSCAI Commissioner Jason Matheny urges the [US to
"coordinate AI developments with NATO]{.mark} and making India the focus
of the United State's Indo-Pacific AI strategy to counter China." And
[this is in line with]{.mark} Joe [Biden's idea]{.mark} of forging a
technological future with its allies.]{.underline}

Second, [developing operational concepts and making organizational
changes that fully exploit the available technologies. The interwar
experience suggests that [militaries that do better]{.mark} in
[developing operational concepts,]{.mark} and [making organizational
changes]{.mark} will [prevai]{.mark}l. US National Defense Strategy
(NDS) argues that, "[success]{.mark} no longer [goes]{.mark} to the
country that develops a new technology first, but rather [to the one
that better integrates it]{.mark} [and adapts its]{.mark} way of
fighting." [China is]{.mark} relatively [slow]{.mark} [in creating new
concepts of operation,]{.mark} and [even slower in making organizational
adaptations]{.mark}]{.underline}. PLA Lieutenant General Liu Guozhi, the
director of the Central Military Commission's Science and Technology
Commission, is frustrated, saying that ["change of mindset is very hard,
overcoming obstacles from interested groups is even harder. But those
two problems often exist simultaneously." In other words, it takes China
longer to convert technological advances into military capabilities. If
the US moves fast enough, China will always be a follower learning from
and responding to the US's way of war.]{.underline}

Third, drawing on cold war strategies, the [US will resort to grey zone
operations in order to impose costs on China. NSD is concerned about
China's grey zone activities and determined to push back against China
with all measures short of war. Inspired by the case of Poland's
Solidarity in the 1980s, the [US and its allies have launched a global
name-and-shame campaign]{.mark}]{.underline} on Xinjiang, Hong Kong,
South China Sea issues, as well as Chinese influence operations in
Australia. Those information campaigns successfully helped them disrupt
China's 5G roll-out in Europe[. It seems that [they will double down on
this approach]{.mark} by launching an information campaign against China
Standards 2035, and "a strategic communications campaign to highlight
BGI's links to the Chinese government and how China is utilizing AI to
[enable ethically problematic developments in biotechnology and
strengthen international bioethical norms and standards regarding
genomics research."]{.mark}]{.underline}

https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/fastthinking/the-triumphs-and-question-marks-from-this-weeks-nato-summit/

[While most NATO meetings are "choreographed to showcase
solidarity]{.underline}," Chris tells us, "the feeling on the ground in
Madrid is that **[this summit genuinely delivered the
goods]{.underline}**." [Leaders]{.underline} managed to overcome
concerns about potential cracks appearing because they "under-promised
and [over-delivered on a diverse agenda, showcasing tangible progress on
a number of issues]{.underline}."

And thanks to Turkey lifting its blockade of Finland and Sweden's bids
for membership, he adds, Madrid became an "enlargement summit" and
"served to highlight NATO's democratic culture: What might have been a
narrative of allies and partners bickering instead showed those
divisions as a source of strength" as Alliance members worked "through
their differences constructively."

Gabriela notes that if the theme of last year's Brussels summit was "the
US is back," this year's was "the West is back." She adds: "[NATO is
emerging from this week with more unity on the political and military
fronts]{.underline} than it has had in a generation."

**Global Times June 30**, 2022, "'Unity of NATO' a disguise of its
existential crisis,"
https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202206/1269395.shtml

Erdogan achieved his political goals with this move, and the fact that
**[[NATO is internally scattered]{.underline}]{.mark}** has come to the
fore. The [[divisions within NATO grow]{.underline}]{.mark} as more
countries are dragged in. The US hopes to bridge the divisions within
NATO, but [[it\'s difficult to cater to all needs]{.underline}]{.mark}.

On the issue of the Russia-Ukraine conflict alone, [[there are different
demands among]{.mark} Western countries, as [Germany, France and
Italy]{.mark} want to stop the war as soon as possible, [and the
US]{.mark} is calling on all NATO countries to make a common cause
against Russia]{.underline}. Wang Shuo, a professor at the School of
International Relations of Beijing Foreign Studies University, believes
that in this situation, many European countries are questioning whether
NATO can solve the crisis in Ukraine. If it cannot work, what\'s the
point of NATO\'s existence? At the moment when Europeans believe that
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} needs to play a role, it [[proved itself
disunited and incompetent]{.underline}]{.mark}, another sign of NATO\'s
existential crisis.

[[The]{.mark} Defense Innovation Accelerator and NATO Innovation
[Fund]{.mark} announced at the NATO Summit are welcome
developments]{.underline}, **[but they require new authorities and
differentiated talent]{.underline}**. Swift technological change has
meant governments and the military created new organizations and
approaches to innovation and rapid acquisition. Unfortunately, many do
not have the necessary authority, budget, or workforce to succeed,
meaning that meaningful change and impact have been sacrificed for
theater. [For the newly announced Defense Innovation Accelerator North
Atlantic]{.underline} (**[DIANA]{.underline}**) -- with planned
locations in Toronto and Cambridge, UK -- and the NATO Innovation Fund
(NIF) [to succeed]{.underline}, **[they [must address authority and
budget concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and then bring in the right
personnel to lead and staff them. Authorities. [There are three key
authorities that [NATO must get right]{.mark} for DIANA and NIF:
[reporting lines]{.mark}]{.underline}, [patience]{.underline} (or
willingness to accept failure), [and]{.underline} [decision
making]{.underline}. First, DIANA and NIF should operate independently
with a direct line into the most senior decision-makers (the Secretary
General, SACEUR, Supreme Allied Commander Transformation --- SACT, etc).
Second, they need to be allowed to fail. The most impactful defense
organizations (and indeed commercial organizations, particularly in the
startup world) normalize taking big bets, with the knowledge that many
will likely fail, and even the ones that succeed may take years to
realize their full impact. Third and finally, these new NATO bodies need
to invest in or provide support to initiatives and startups without
requiring external permission or consensus. At the same time,
[[they]{.mark} also [need a clear transition partner]{.mark} for
promising capabilities to be handed off to]{.underline} (e.g. [DARPA
transitioning tech to [the U.S.]{.mark} Department of
Defense]{.underline}), which can move from development to deployment.
[**This [will enable the Alliance to more readily identify]{.mark},
[develop]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [deploy emerging and disruptive
technologies]{.mark}.** Similar efforts]{.underline} including the U.S.
Department of Defense's DARPA and Defense Innovation Unit, CIA's
In-Q-Tel, and USAF's Strategic Capabilities Office, [are effective
because they exist outside of traditional bureaucracies]{.underline},
[leverage non-traditional talent strategies]{.underline}, [and have
consistent budgets]{.underline}. Budget. [[Allocating funding seems
obvious]{.mark}, but [too often limited forethought is given to this
issue]{.mark}]{.underline}. To [ensure success, organizational funding
must be significant, multi-year, and consistent or include inbuilt
annual growth]{.underline}. A number of high-potential initiatives have
either been announced with no dedicated funding or have had sizable
funding gaps in subsequent years damaging their brand and relationships
with defense companies and startups alike. The NIF in particular will
likely rely on the willingness of Alliance members to make contributions
beyond other NATO obligations. If so, multi-year commitments are
crucial, as are success metrics, such as return on investment, which are
rarely used within NATO or national government departments. Talent.
[Finally, and most overlooked, is [getting talent
right]{.mark}]{.underline}. External talent is crucial. It is not enough
to simply construct new organizations staffed in the traditional manner.
To realize their full potential, NATO must attract talent with startup
and/or venture capital (VC) experience, and pair them with top
subject-matter experts from R&D communities, both government, and
commercial. [This [cannot be done with NATO's current Byzantine, long,
drawn-out hiring process]{.mark}]{.underline}, which can last six months
or even longer, and advantage insiders versus external candidates. [As
such [the Alliance must engage and attract this talent]{.mark}. The good
news is NATO has a number of potential examples to draw on for potential
hiring pathways]{.underline}. In the U.S. the Defense Digital Service
hires design and technical experts for one-to-two "tours of duty," using
their skillsets and operate outside the traditional civil service. In
the UK, strategy and technology professionals are seconded into the
Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade, and intelligence
organizations such as GCHQ, to provide experience or skills that may not
exist within the current civil service workforce. [But [providing
pathways]{.mark} [alone is not enough]{.mark}]{.underline}: [attracting
this talent to apply and convincing them to join is just as
important]{.underline}. [This requires identifying areas where they
might work, including industry]{.underline}, [academia]{.underline},
[and startups]{.underline}, and VC. At the same time, other steps are
needed. Upskilling existing NATO civilians -- [among the international
and international military staff]{.underline} (IS and IMS) --- [and
Alliance service members are needed to address this skill and
understanding gap]{.underline}. To [do so, it is helpful to expose them
to startup and VC environments]{.underline}. Programs like Shift's
Defense Ventures Program in the U.S. have succeeded in building
understanding between the Department of Defense's civilian and military
workforce and startups and VCs. They've done so by bringing in
high-performing defense personnel for eight-week immersions with growing
venture-backed startups or VC firms. This cultivates the necessary
connective tissue between startups, VCs, and the military. NATO could
readily follow a similar process by providing its highest performers the
opportunity to temporarily work alongside leading North American and
European startups and investors. What's Next? [Accelerating the
development, deployment, and integration of emerging and disruptive
technologies into the strategic and tactical environments is at the core
of future NATO operations]{.underline}. [The Alliance's move to build
DIANA]{.underline} and NIF, along with incorporating the right language
into strategic documents are significant first steps. But [building
[these initiatives]{.mark} from scratch will require significant
planning to establish the right authorities]{.underline},
[budget]{.underline}, [and talent environment]{.underline} [to enable
these organizations]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [thrive]{.underline}.
**[In order to do so, they [need to build outside of traditional NATO
structures and models while creating a differentiated talent and
organizational culture]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### 2AC EU CP

#### EU market fragmented and bogged down by regulations 

Ronte, **Hanno, et al.** 20**22,** "Deciding on the Right Path."
*Deloitte Insights*, Deloitte,
https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/life-sciences/expanding-into-european-biotech-industry.html.

Whether based in the US or in a European country, [[biotech and pharma
companies have]{.mark} continued to look to expand in(to) Europe
(including the UK), as their top priority. However, some have [struggled
to make]{.mark} a [success of]{.mark} their [attempts at
European]{.mark} geographical [expansion.]{.mark}]{.underline} The most
relevant and recent example of this is [US-based Bluebird Bio]{.mark}.
[[Following unsuccessful negotiations]{.mark} with national agencies
(e.g. in Germany) [to try and launch their]{.mark} first [drug]{.mark}
[in Europe]{.mark}, Zynteglo [executives made the decision to]{.mark}
wind down their operations and [focus]{.mark} their [business on the
US]{.mark}.]{.underline}1

Nonetheless, Europe remains an important market for biotech companies
(biotechs) launching their new drugs, as it accounts for over 20 per
cent of the total global pharma market.2 In this piece, we explore how
best to expand into Europe.

A complex and fragmented market

[[The European market is complex and fragmented]{.mark}.]{.underline} It
comprises 31 markets across Europe, including the UK and Switzerland[.
[Biopharma products require]{.mark} regulatory [approval]{.mark}
[fro]{.mark}m the [European Medicines Agency]{.mark} (EMA)
[and/or]{.mark} the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
[(MHRA)]{.mark} for the UK. [In addition,]{.mark} some [nations]{.mark}
(e.g. Italy) [require approval from]{.mark} their own [local/regional
regulatory authorities]{.mark}.3 [There are]{.mark} [also distinct
healthcare systems]{.mark}, separate health technology assessments
[(HTA)]{.mark} and reimbursement processes for each market.
[Additionally, recent changes to EU regulations]{.mark} (for example,
the Clinical Trial Regulation and new Medical Device/IVD Regulation)[4
and]{.mark} other market uncertainties, such as [cross-border
collaborations]{.mark} [and]{.mark} their potential [impact on market
access, are making]{.mark} it increasingly [difficult for
biotechs]{.mark} [to forge ahead]{.mark}.]{.underline}5 Given all these
changing dimensions, determining how best to expand effectively has
never been more crucial.

#### EU lags behind US and China in biotech development now -- fails to solve as well

**Matthews 22** (David Matthews; experienced writer for the
Science\|Business news source, "*EU fears falling behind in race to
control key technologies*"
\[https://sciencebusiness.net/news/eu-fears-falling-behind-race-control-key-technologies\]
Accessed 7/6/22, TR)

In a future-gazing report, [the **Eu**ropean Commission has **warned**
that control over technology is an increasingly crucial geopolitical
battleground, and that the EU is **losing the** investment **race in**
quantum computing, 5G, **a**rtificial **i**ntelligence and
**biotech**nology]{.underline}. The communication, released on 29 June,
concludes that, "[The EU's currently **limited capacity** in some
horizontal technologies weakens its position]{.underline}." It cites
figures from the consultancy McKinsey showing an [investment gap with
the US, and in many cases China]{.underline}. [Half of all quantum
computing companies are in the US, 40% are in China, and none are in the
EU,]{.underline} warns the Commission's report, which focuses on how
Europe will steer through a digital and environmental transformation of
its society and economy. In [artificial intelligence, the US attracts
40% of investment funding. Asia, including China, has a 32% share, but
Europe lags with just 12%]{.underline}. On 5G, the next generation
telecoms network, China attracts 60% of investment, far ahead of
Europe's 11% share. [And **US investments** into biotechnology **dwarf**
those made in **Eu**rope]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, the report urges
big increases in spending on R&D. "The EU will need to leverage
additional private and public long-term investments in \[...\] R&I
across critical technologies and sectors, uptake and synergies between
technologies, human capital, and infrastructures," it says. It doesn't
specifically mention research funding programmes as a solution, but
instead suggests deepening EU banking and capital market integration to
allow more private investment. There are also indications of which
specific technologies the Commission sees as key to greening the
economy. Most notably, the report mentions nuclear "small modular
reactors" as an important part of sustainably offsetting the increasing
power demands of the digital sector. These are mini nuclear reactors
that can be manufactured in a factory rather than assembled onsite. So
far they are unproven, but a US-based company has plans to build one in
Romania, with US government financial backing. The Commission also moots
the idea of electric aircraft connecting small regional airports
throughout the EU. Digital tech can help make Europe greener, through
smarter control over power grids and transport systems, the report says.
But the digital sector is also expected to be an increasingly hungry
consumer of energy, powering everything from consumer computers to data
centres and minting cryptocurrencies. ICT is thought to be responsible
for 5-9% of global electricity use. Reflecting a shift in Brussels
towards the prioritisation of scientific links with fellow democracies,
the Commission's report recommends a "proactive research and innovation
agenda with like-minded partners."

### 2AC CP -- cbw treaties

#### Treaties fail -- evolving international governance structures of biotech is key

Philip **Breedlove and** Margaret E. **Kosal '19**, February 25. General
Philip Breedlove (U.S.AF, ret.) served as Supreme Allied Commander

"Emerging Technologies and National Security: Russia, NATO, & the
European Theater," HOOVER INSTITUTION,
https://www.hoover.org/research/emerging-technologies-and-national-security-russia-nato-european-theater

[Most international [legal]{.mark} and regulatory [approaches
to]{.mark}]{.underline} technologies and to emerging
technologies---robotics, [[biotech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline},
synthetic genomics, gain of function research, nanotechnology, cognitive
neurosciences, hypersonics, AI---[[are still driven by
20th-Century]{.mark} (or earlier) [conceptions and institutions]{.mark}.
**[Past methods]{.mark}** for other technologies [that do not take into
account the]{.mark} international nature of the science and the
[industry are **not adequate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Any international
regime or approach must be interdisciplinary in focus, cognizant of the
multi-polar post-Cold War world, and appreciate the role of private
funders, commercial development, and transnational corporations. To be
clear, there's a lot of good in the arms control and nonproliferation
existing institutions. Rather, these [**[challenges are primarily
political]{.mark}** rather than technical. Being able to navigate and
affect policy at the interface of science and international affairs is
where we have immense value]{.underline}.

The tension between adoption and governance of technology must be
considered as part of the balance of power. The utility of treaties may
be better viewed as more than only a guarantee against using a weapon.
[**[Weapons treaties were never an ironclad guarantee]{.mark}** that
weapons would not be used]{.underline}. Treaties provide stability,
reduce uncertainty; enable dialogue, and are confidence building
measures. The utility of weapon prohibition treaties as balancing should
not be ignored, not because of an idealized imagination that prohibition
effectively and permanently limits proliferation or use of a technology
but because the act of meeting, networking, building relationships, and
negotiating provides a forum for interacting and addressing underlying
issues. From this standpoint, [[governance approaches should be
integral]{.mark} to an integrated military strategy for future
capabilities development, [not]{.mark} the afterthought that **[attempts
to put the]{.mark} metaphorical [genie back in the
bottle]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

3. IQVIA PharmaDeals, January 2021. China and Europe also saw strong
growth as they started to catch up from a smaller base.

IPO activity has grown faster than any other category of fundraising,
with companies raising \$34.3 billion in 2020, an increase of 186
percent on the previous year. Although US biotechs represented the
lion's share of IPOs, companies based elsewhere, particularly in China,
have also seen significant growth in the past few years. Biotechs tend
to source opening capital from their local stock market, with the United
States (mainly NASDAQ) being the preferred nonlocal option.

As part of our research, McKinsey asked biotech executives whether they
were likely to seek an IPO in the next few years and, if they did,
whether they would look for capital at home or abroad. The answers were
mixed. Some biotechs want to make the most of their local network and
feel more comfortable listing at a market they know; others prefer to
follow investors, crossing oceans if need be. But they all agreed on
choosing a market where biotech and science are not seen as a risky
investment, which often means a foreign stock exchange, and specifically
a US one.

[As the pandemic spread across the globe in early 2020, biotech leaders
were initially pessimistic, reassessing their cash position and
financing constraints]{.underline}. When McKinsey and BioCentury
interviewed representatives from 106 biotech companies in May 2020, 4 4.
See "COVID-19: Reimagining biotech in 2021," webinar, BioCentury, July
8, 2020, biocentury.com. [half of those interviewed were expecting
delays in financing, and about 80 percent were tight on cash for the
next two years and considering trade-offs such as deferring IPOs and
acquisitions.]{.underline} Executives feared that valuations would
decline because of lower revenue projections and concerns about
clinical-trial delays, salesforce-effectiveness gaps, and other
operational issues.

Belying this downbeat mood, [[biotech]{.mark} has in fact [had one of
its best years]{.mark} so far. By January 2021, venture capitalists had
invested some 60 percent more than they had in January 2020, with more
than \$3 billion invested worldwide in January 2021 alon]{.underline}e.
5 5. BCIQ, January 2021. IPO activity grew strongly: there were 19 more
closures than in the same period in 2020, with an average of \$150
million per raise, 17 percent more than in 2020. Other deals have also
had a bumper start to 2021, with the average deal size reaching more
than \$500 million, up by more than 66 percent on the 2020 average
(Exhibit 3). 6 6. IQVIA PharmaDeals, January 2021.

The analysis above does not include special-purpose acquisition
companies (SPACs), which have recently become significant in IPOs in
several industries. Some biotech investors we interviewed believe that
SPACs represent a route to an IPO. How SPACs will evolve remains to be
seen, but biotechs may be part of their story.

[When we asked [executives and investors]{.mark} why the biotech sector
had stayed so resilient during the worst economic crisis in decades,
they [cited innovation as the main reason]{.mark}. The number of assets
transitioning to clinical phases is still rising, and further waves of
innovation are on the horizon, driven by the convergence of biological
and technological advances.]{.underline}

In the present day, many biotechs, along with the wider pharmaceutical
industry, are taking steps to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Together,
biotechs and pharma companies have more than 250 vaccine candidates in
their pipelines, along with a similar number of therapeutics. What's
more, the crisis has shone a spotlight on pharma as the public seeks to
understand the roadblocks involved in delivering a vaccine at speed and
the measures needed to maintain safety and efficacy standards. To that
extent, the world has been living through a time of mass education in
science research and development.

[[Biotech has]{.mark} also benefited from its [innate financial
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Healthcare as a whole is less
dependent on economic cycles than most other industries]{.underline}.
Biotech is an innovator, actively identifying and addressing patients'
unmet needs. In addition, [[biotechs']{.underline}]{.mark} top-line
[[revenues have been less affected by lockdowns
than]{.underline}]{.mark} is the case in most [[other
industries]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Another factor acting in the sector's favor is that [larger
pharmaceutical companies still rely on biotechs as a source of
innovation]{.underline}. [With the top dozen pharma companies having
more than \$170 billion]{.underline} in excess reserves that could be
available for spending on M&A, the prospects for further financing and
deal making look promising.

For these and other reasons, [[many investors regard biotech as a safe
haven]{.underline}]{.mark}. One interviewee felt
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[benefited from a halo effect during the
pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The investors and executives we interviewed agreed that biotech
innovation continues to increase in quality and quantity despite the
macroeconomic environment. Evidence can be seen in the accelerating pace
of assets transitioning across the development lifecycle. When we
tracked the number of assets transitioning to Phase I, Phase II, and
Phase III clinical trials, we found that Phase I and Phase II assets
have transitioned 50 percent faster since 2018 than between 2013 and
2018, whereas Phase III assets have maintained much the same pace. There
could be many reasons for this, but it is worth noting that biotechs
with Phase I and Phase II assets as their lead assets have accounted for
more than half of biotech IPOs. Having an early IPO gives a biotech
earlier access to capital and leaves it with more scope to concentrate
on science.

[Looking forward, the combination of advances in biological science and
accelerating developments in technology and artificial intelligence has
the potential to take innovation to a new level.]{.underline} A recent
report from the McKinsey Global Institute analyzed the profound
[economic and social impact of biological innovation and found that
biomolecules, biosystems, biomachines, and biocomputing could
collectively produce up to 60 percent of the physical inputs to the
global economy.]{.underline} The applications of this "Bio Revolution"
range from agriculture (such as the production of nonanimal meat) to
energy and materials, and from consumer goods (such as multi-omics
tailored diets) to a multitude of health applications.

Our interviews with biotech executives and investors suggest that if the
industry is to maintain its recent strong growth, it will need to
address three key areas: building talent, handling complexity, and
improving commercial and development execution.

As one biotech investor put it, "There is much more capital available
than talent." Many companies struggle to attract and retain executives
with experience in biotech, business development, and commercialization.
In addition, a third of the executives and investors we interviewed
think that European biotechs lack a sufficiently entrepreneurial
mindset. Clinical-development expertise is also in short supply.

The talent pool has been growing in recent years, particularly in the
United States, with Europe, China, and other regions still a ways
behind. Some companies are establishing a global footprint early on to
target the widest possible talent pool, such as the European biotechs
that have set up US affiliates and distributed their
business-development, access, marketing, and strategy teams across
continents. Other biotechs are experimenting with outsourcing models,
keeping select talent in-house but looking outside the organization for
multiple specialist capabilities. Whichever approach companies choose to
pursue, their ability to build, attract, and retain biotech talent will
be fundamental to their success.

As well as staying on top of accelerating technological and biological
advances, biotechs must navigate an increasingly complex ecosystem of
competitors, service providers, investors, and customers. We see three
challenges for the future. One is for biotech companies to rethink
supply chains in order to facilitate the scale-up of new biologic
innovations and technologies, such as personalized therapies and cell
and gene therapies. A second challenge is to maintain focus on the
business while dealing with a new financing and investing ecosystem that
includes novel investment vehicles such as SPACs, an increasing number
of noninstitutional investors, and a broadening of the geographic
footprint of investors. The third challenge, for smaller biotechs in
particular, is simply to keep up with the speed of technological
evolution.

A recent McKinsey analysis of launch performance shows that first-time
launchers have a lower share of successful launches than their more
experienced peers. Many struggle to realize the expected value from
their launches: the median first-time launcher reaches just 63 percent
of analysts' expectations, compared with 93 percent for experienced
launchers.

Clearly, scientific promise does not necessarily translate into business
performance. A stronger focus on execution could help biotechs create
more value from their assets and technologies. For instance, investing
early to develop a deep understanding of the market in relevant disease
areas could help biotechs make better decisions about how to position
their product in relation to competitors' offerings, both during
clinical development and in the marketplace. Biotechs could also benefit
from tailoring their go-to-market approaches to the needs and potential
of their products rather than the resources available to them. Having
defined an appropriate go-to-market approach, they could then work to
secure sufficient funding or set up partnerships to support it.

Biotechs also have scope to improve the pace and quality of their
clinical development, which is critical in meeting investors'
expectations and securing funding. As innovation increases, so does
competition for clinical-trial sites and investigator capacity. Getting
to market quickly requires biotechs to intensify their focus on clinical
operations, plan early, and find ways to derisk clinical development.

[[Biotech is unlike any other sector]{.mark}. [Buoyed up by advances in
science and technology, it bucked the downward trend seen in many
industries and attracted record levels of investment through 2020
and]{.mark} into early 20[21]{.mark}]{.underline}. More broadly, the
pandemic has brought biological science to the attention of patients,
families, healthcare workers, healthcare suppliers, governments, and
agencies worldwide. What remains to be seen is whether biotechs and
their ecosystems can continue to scale up rapidly and keep riding the
wave for some time to come.

### Bioterror NEG -- no risk

#### Bioterrorism is Neither Likely Nor Practical 

**Zinkgraf,**,** 15** (Samuel Zinkgraf,

The [[historical record demonstrates]{.mark} that weaponized [biological
agents]{.mark} [have been used infrequently and
ineffectuall]{.mark}]{.underline}[y]{.mark}[. Terrorists want to spread
destruction by any means they can]{.underline}. [If [bioterrorism really
was effective]{.underline}]{.mark}[, [more terrorist groups]{.mark}
likely [would have used pathogens as weapons by
now]{.mark}]{.underline}. The absence of widespread bioterrorism helps
to show the gap between current misconceptions and reality. One gram of
anthrax contained within one of the letters in 2001 had enough spores to
kill thousands of people. Combined, the amount of anthrax used in the
attacks could have killed millions.10 Yet the attacks only killed five.
Even though the anthrax terrorist had enough biological agent to kill
millions, he did not have the capability to distribute his weapon
effectively. As the Aum Shinrikyo biological attacks demonstrated, even
a sophisticated group of scientists working to incite global Armageddon
can find it difficult to actually execute biological attacks.

[[Terrorists have to overcome a number of challenges in order to
effectively convert biological agents into weapons of mass
destructio]{.underline}n]{.mark}. [The use of a pathogen as a biological
agent depends on the group's ability to isolate a virulent strain,
weaponize it, and then distribute]{.underline} it. If the group could
successfully isolate a dangerous genetic strain, [[it would]{.mark} then
[turn to two]{.mark} possible [methods of distribution: aerosolized
spray and human carriers]{.mark}.11 Most [non-state actors]{.mark} [do
not possess the technology necessary]{.mark} to refine the aerosol
method.]{.underline} [[Wind patterns and humidity]{.mark} can [render
such an attack ineffective]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[human carrier
method]{.mark} is less expensive but also [has a number of
problems]{.mark}. It [requires]{.mark} the pathogen to be a
[contagion]{.mark}. Once the [carrier]{.mark} is infected, he [must be
mobile while contagious and cannot be visibly
ill]{.mark}]{.underline}---[a [situation]{.mark} that [is unlikely with
serious diseases]{.mark} like Ebola.11 All [other possible means]{.mark}
of delivering a biological agent [are]{.mark} [fraught with]{.mark}
[even more problems.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### China NEG -- not rising

#### China won't surpass U.S. in biotech

AND IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. POLICY," GLOBAL CHINA,
https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FP_20200427_china_biotechnology_moore.pdf

Yet on the other hand, [while China's biotechnology sector will almost
certainly continue to grow in scale, sophistication, and
competitiveness, there is little reason to believe on current trends
that the United States will lose its edge in the sector]{.underline}.
Indeed, [the biggest risk to the global competitiveness of the U.S.
biotechnology industry likely comes from the prospect of declining
public investment and reduced mobility for world-class researchers and
industry professionals]{.underline}. Moreover, the COVID-19 crisis
underscores both the importance of continued investment in biotechnology
and the many challenges to promoting effective international cooperation
on global health security.

#### Patents indicate US biotech remains in the lead

**Ivypanda '19** (\"Biotechnology Development and the U.S. Economic
Hegemony Research Paper"
<https://ivypanda.com/essays/biotechnology-development-and-the-u-s-economic-hegemony/>)
7/6/2022

[An]{.mark}other [[indicator of gauging a country's]{.mark} competitive
[position is]{.mark}]{.underline} in the assessment of [[the number of
patents]{.underline}]{.mark} issued to individuals or institutions of
that country.15

According to the U.S. Patent and Trade Office (USPTO), a patent awards
ownership rights to a person who "invents or discovers any new and
useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any
new and useful improvement thereof." 16 By this definition, [[patents
are]{.mark}]{.underline} undoubtedly an [[indicator of future value and
national might]{.mark} in a]{.underline} technology, product or
[industry.]{.underline}

By this measure, the United States position seems to be very strong.
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates assignees **[lead all other
countries]{.mark}** in patents]{.underline} issues by the USPTO.

[According to an examination by the USPTO of patents in the United
States and in other countries, [U.S.]{.mark} origin inventors and owners
[have the ]{.mark}]{.underline}[most biotech]{.mark}nology-related [U.S.
[patents by a wide margin]{.mark} and the most biotechnology-related
patent publications internationally]{.underline}, but by a slimmer
margin. Additionally[, the USPTO analysis established that [U.S.]{.mark}
assignees [have the most biotech]{.mark}nology-related
[inventions]{.mark} that have patent publications [in three or more
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The figure]{.mark} placed at 31.7% [is a strong indication]{.mark} of
a more aggressive pursuit of international intellectual property
protection and, by supposition, of [its]{.mark} professed [potential
value]{.mark}.]{.underline} By this measurement, the United States is
followed by Japan (26.9%), Germany (11.3%), Korea (6.6%), and France
(3.6%).17

There has been quick growth in biotechnology patents in the USPTO and
European Patent Office (EPO) patent databases. A study conducted in 2007
established that [the number of U.S. biotechnology patents in the USPTO
and EPO databases grew at a close exponential pace between 1980 and
2004.]{.underline}

The study showed that each year from 1990, [[U.S]{.mark}. assignees have
[taken up]{.mark} an approximate of [two-thirds of all patents]{.mark}
in the USPTO database.]{.underline} [In 2004, U.S. assignees took up
66.9% of USPTO biotechnology patents. An earlier examination of USPTO
data, covering patents from 1976 to 2002 also indicated U.S.
biotechnology patent leadership, with the United States accounting for
over 67% of patents]{.underline}, followed by Japan, Germany, France,
and Canada.18

Although patents have shortcomings when it comes to assessing future
competitiveness in terms of economic gains, [there is no doubt that, the
United States is leading in this area]{.underline}. If the recent trend
is anything to go by, then [[there is no doubt that the U.S. will
**maintain its competitive edge** in biotech]{.mark}nology
[developmen]{.mark}]{.underline}[t]{.mark}.19

### China NEG -- coop not conflict

#### China and the U.S. depend on each other which incentivizes biotech coop

Rob **Carlson and** Rik **Wehbring '20**, "TWO WORLDS TWO BIOECONOMIES,"
National Security Report, JOHNS HOPKINS
https://www.jhuapl.edu/Content/documents/Carlson_Wehbring-Biotech.pdf

[[The bioeconomies of the two]{.mark} nations may be similar in size but
[are configured differently]{.mark}. The **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [relies on China for
manufacturing]{.mark}]{.underline} (for example, 75 percent of active
pharmaceutical ingredients), [for [services]{.mark}]{.underline} (for
example, DNA sequencing), [[and]{.mark} for talented [students
who]{.mark} come to [study and work at]{.mark} US [universities]{.mark}.
Meanwhile, [China depends on external basic research to support a
bioeconomy focused on commercialization of innovations]{.mark} created
elsewhere. In the short term, **[decoupling would be painful for
both]{.mark} countries**]{.underline}. In the long term, it would be
easier for the United States to replace manufacturing capacity and
academic labor than it would be for China to find globally, or to
replicate within China, a basic research and academic infrastructure
that is the equivalent to that of the United States.

#### China doesn't want hegemony

David P. **Goldman '22**, January 3, "Why does the West think China
wants global hegemony?" ASIA TIMES,
https://asiatimes.com/2022/01/why-does-the-west-think-china-wants-global-hegemony/

[Americans think that China aspires to world hegemony]{.underline},
while Professor Wen contends that the aspiration to hegemony as such is
the fatal flaw of empires past and present. Americans will dismiss Wen's
analysis as Chinese dissembling, but they would be mistaken to do so.

[[China's exaggerated assertion of sovereignty]{.mark} in the South
China Sea, its island-building campaign [and attempts to intimidate its
neighbors give]{.mark} Washington [reason to assume the worst]{.mark}
about China's intentions. [But China never has been a hegemonic
power]{.mark} in the past, certainly not in the sense of the British
Empire or Soviet Communism. [Nor does it intend to become such a power
in the future]{.mark}]{.underline}.

America's Cold War triumph, Wen believes, was simply "the most recent
decisive victory" in a long series of contests with other putative
hegemons, including "the Spanish Empire, the Dutch Empire, the French
Empire and the German Empire."

China, adds Professor Wen, was a bystander to the Great Power
competition for hegemony during the 1960s and 1970s. This in turn was a
contest within a "small world," between Western civilization and Eastern
Orthodox civilization, in which the non-Christian civilizations --
Chinese, Indian and Islamic -- had limited stakes. This "battle for
world hegemony within 'Christian civilization' is unacceptable," he
concluded: "World hegemony exercised in the name of liberalism must be
opposed by the people of the world, and world hegemony exercised in the
name of communism also must be opposed by the people of the world."

Hegemons have an invariant characteristic. Real empires run deficits.
Imports made up half of the food supply in Pericles' Athens, paid for by
tribute exacted on threat of annihilation.

Profesor Graham Allison notes in his 2017 book Destined for War, "Athens
\[during the Thirty Years' Peace\] continued to use its powerful navy to
dominate -- and extract gold from -- its own subjects throughout the
Aegean. It amassed a strategic reserve amounting to the previously
unheard-of sum of 6,000 talents of gold, and was adding 1,000 talents
per year in revenue."

When the island of Melos resisted, Athens massacred its population in
416 BCE.

The Roman Empire kept between 5 and 8 million slaves, requiring 250,000
to 400,000 new slaves per year, in Walter Scheidel's estimate. That
required ever more wars of conquest.

The Spanish Empire, Fernand Braudel reported in his classic study The
Mediterranean in the Age of Philip II, sent all the bullion wrung from
the conquered New World to China to pay for silks and spices.

And all the wealth accumulated by China returned to the West when
Britain compelled it at cannon-point to buy Indian opium. Opium in 1837
accounted for 57% of China's imports, and opium smokers paid 100 million
taels (about 130 million ounces of silver) yearly for the drug when the
Imperial government stood at just 40 million taels.

America doesn't force its trading partners to buy opium, but its chronic
trade deficits have produced a \$13 trillion negative net foreign asset
position. America's borrowings from the rest of the world include \$8
trillion of Treasury securities held by foreigners and about \$16
trillion in dollar-denominated foreign bank deposits, which constitute
de facto loans to the United States.

Historic China accumulated vast wealth through the exports of silk, tea,
porcelain and other goods, but it never built an imperial economy like
Athens, Rome or Britain. Agriculture was centered on the extended family
farm rather than slave-based latifundia.

Unlike Rome, which constructed roads to speed its armies from
Mesopotamia to Britain, China built walls to keep invaders out. The Qin
dynasty which gave China its name, consolidated power through
infrastructure, including the Dujiangyan on the Min River that turned
the Sichuan plain into China's breadbasket.

Unlike Greeks, Romans, Spaniards, Englishmen and Americans, [the Chinese
never sent their armies or large numbers of colonists around the
world]{.underline}.

When I wrote of "China's plan to Sino-form the world" in my 2020 book, I
referred to the export of China's digital infrastructure to the Global
South, in the ultimate exercise of soft power.

Its 5G broadband, fast trains, e-commerce, e-finance, telemedicine and
other Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies well may transform
backward economies into little Chinas, starting in Southeast Asia.

[[China]{.mark} surely [aspires to]{.mark} return to [first position
in]{.mark} world manufacturing [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}, which
it held from the beginning of recorded history until the 18th century,
and it will try to extend its influence and power by dominating the new
technologies enabled by fast broadband.

In a sense, China's strategic use of infrastructure, physical as well as
digital, bespeaks a certain continuity from the Qin era. Massive
investment in flood control, river transport and irrigation created
China, and the export of Chinese infrastructure well may hard-wire a
great deal of the world into China's economy.

[But China is indifferent to how we barbarians govern
ourselves]{.underline}. Elsewhere Professor Wen has compared the
character of the Chinese, a settled people for thousands of years, to
that of Westerners, who (as he put it) only recently walked out of the
jungle.

I think that he is quite unfair to us. **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}**
the point is that [[the Chinese have no intention of imposing their
political system on the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}; they do not believe we are capable of
such enlightened governance.

[The Soviet Union]{.underline}, I should add, [fell not only because it
overreached, but because the United States responded to its hegemonic
ambitions by starting a revolution in military technology. From this we
derived every important invention of the digital age, from mass-produced
computer chips to optical networks]{.underline}.

[China]{.underline} is well aware of this: Its [promotion of dual-use
technologies]{.underline}, as I wrote in the Wall Street Journal in
2020, [is adapted from America's best practice]{.underline}.

If China has no hegemonic ambitions, Western analysts ask, why has it
built a navy worthy of a hegemon? With 355 ocean-going vessels, the
Peoples Liberation Army Navy has more ships than the US -- although much
lower tonnage.

A November 2021 Pentagon report warned: "As of 2020, the PLAN is largely
composed of modern multi-role platforms featuring advanced anti-ship,
anti-air and anti-submarine weapons and sensors ... This modernization
aligns with the PRC's growing emphasis on the maritime domain and
increasing demands for the PLAN to operate at greater distances from
China."

At this writing, [[China has only one overseas military base]{.mark}, on
the Horn of Africa at Djibouti, built for anti-piracy operations. **[The
US has 750]{.mark} bases**]{.underline}. There have been unconfirmed
reports of [[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} attempts to build [[military
facilities]{.underline}]{.mark} in the UAE and Equatorial Guinea, but
they [[do not add up to a campaign for global military
supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### US. and China are cooperating now

In recent years, however, "[the government became really invested in
encouraging innovation," enacting several policy and regulatory
changes,]{.underline} says Li Yan, MD, PhD, chief medical officer of
Brii Biosciences. [China's National Medical Products Administration
(NMPA) initiated a hiring spree, drastically increasing the number of
reviewers in its Centre for Drug Evaluation[. In 2018, the agency
shortened the review process for clinical trial application]{.mark}s
from an unlimited amount of time to 60 days---on par with the 30-day
process in the United States.]{.underline}

"[Previously[, it was almost impossible to do simultaneous development
in both the U.S. and China]{.mark} because the China cohort was going to
be so far behind," Berlin explains, but]{.underline} [[now concurrent
trials are feasible]{.mark}. NMPA has also begun conducting more
stringent reviews of clinical trials. As of 2016, the government no
longer requires Chinese biotech companies to manufacture their own
drugs---[now]{.mark} [they can outsource to contract manufacturers
rather than building facilities]{.mark}. In 2017, the [government began
updating its National Reimbursement Drug List annually]{.mark} instead
of every 5 years---and has since added many innovative
drugs]{.underline}. [The [NMPA was]{.mark} also [invited to join the
International Council for Harmonisation, which]{.mark} has [helped
China]{.mark} [align its drug-development]{.mark} [regulations with
international standards]{.mark}. In addition, the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange began listing companies before they generate revenue, thus
giving them earlier access to public funding.]{.underline}

"[[These reforms have]{.mark} really [changed the landscape for both
Chinese biotechs, as well as Western biopharma companies operating in
China]{.mark}]{.underline}," Berlin says. The changes are paying off[.
There are now hundreds of Chinese biotechs---many clustered in BioBay,
an industrial park in Suzhou. One is CStone, which is developing
immunotherapies and targeted agents for cancer, focusing on malignancies
such as gastric and liver cancers that are more common in China than in
other countries. The company has 10 agents in 28 clinical trials,
including five late-stage candidates. Notably, CStone, founded in 2015,
is developing several therapies in collaboration with two U.S.
companies---Blueprint Medicines and Agios. Such [partnerships are
becoming increasingly common as China's biotech scene grows.]{.mark}
"[These reforms have]{.mark} actually [provided for]{.mark} a lot [more
opportunity for Western companies to partner with Chinese
biotechs]{.mark}]{.underline} on drug development as well as
commercialization," Berlin says.

The second category of [policy responses involves cultivating

security and nonproliferation in recent decades.58 [[There are promising
signs]{.mark} that [China]{.mark} may be [receptive to]{.mark} such
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In an unusual 2019 speech to

These [[partnerships make sense,]{.underline}]{.mark} Yan adds[, because
[they leverage]{.mark} the [strengths]{.mark} of each
company]{.underline}. [[U.S. businesses]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to
[[have expertise in drug discovery]{.mark} and [designing and running
clinical trials]{.mark}, [whereas Chinese firms have access to a large
patient population and understand China's regulatory
landscape]{.mark}]{.underline}, including how to get drugs approved and
to market. [Therapies are also starting to move in the other
direction.]{.underline} In 2019, the FDA approved BeiGene's Bruton
tyrosine kinase inhibitor zanubrutinib (Brukinsa) for patients with
mantle cell lymphoma---[the first U.S. approval of a drug developed in
China]{.underline}. The agency also designated Chi-Med's angio-immuno
kinase inhibitor surufatinib (HMPL-012) as an orphan drug for pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors. More U.S. corporations are making deals to
license Chinese drugs, too. For example, Lilly partnered with Innovent
Biologics in 2015 to develop Innovent's PD-1 inhibitor sintilimab
(Tyvyt).

To be sure, obstacles remain. Many researchers are returning to Chinese
biotechs after gaining education and experience elsewhere, yet companies
need to continue expanding talent at the highest levels, especially in
running clinical trials. "The competition for talent in China is very
acute now," Berlin notes. Recent investigations into intellectual
property theft by Chinese researchers in the United States have bred
some mistrust between the countries. Additionally, the U.S. government
recently expanded the scope of the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the United States, potentially hindering Chinese investment in U.S.
biotechs.

Despite these challenges, Jiang is hopeful that collaboration will
continue. The [[United States and China are the two largest oncology
markets, he notes, "and there's every incentive for the countries to get
together and have complementary contributions."]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### U.S. will cooperate with China as they rise -- risk of nuclear was is hype

**Jayathilaka 22** (Aruna Jayathilaka; lecturer in Political Science at
Sabaragamuwa University in Sri Lanka, "*Are the China and USA Heading
for a War? Can they Avoid the \'\'Thucydides Trap?*\'\'
\[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4075526\] Accessed
7/7/22, TR)

According to Graham Allison, [there are some possible **avenues** for
both the **China** and **US**A to **avoid** possible
**war**-tension.]{.underline} Firstly both the camps should realize that
the [\'War between nuclear superpowers is madness\']{.underline}. [Both
China and the USA own robust nuclear arsenal; hence leaders must
recognize that **war would be suicidal**.]{.underline} The second lesson
for both parties is to \'Leaders must be prepared to risk a war they
cannot win\'. [It is clear that if war occurs, **both** nations
**lose**, and millions die --- an option no rational leader could
choose]{.underline}. (Allison, The Thucydides Trap, 2017). Nevertheless,
[if a nation is unwilling to risk war, its opponent can win any
objective by forcing the more reliable power to yield. Consequently,
leaders must be willing to select paths that threaten
destruction]{.underline}. The third lesson defines the new \"[precarious
rules of the status quo]{.underline}.\" These rules [include
**armscontrol treaties** and precise road **conventions** for air and
sea]{.underline}. The fourth lesson is that parties should understand
that [\'**Domestic** performance is **decisive**.\' Domestic issues of a
country will have an impact upon international matters]{.underline}.
(Allison, The Thucydides Trap: Are the U.S. and China Headed for War?,
2015). By establishing compromises on problematic areas, [the US and
China might clear the way for **coop**eration **on** challenges like
global **terror**ism and **climate** change, where the two countries\'
**shared national interests outnumber** their
**differences**]{.underline}**.** Overall, leaders must recognize that
[their **existence is contingent on** prudence, communication,
limitations, **compromise, and cooperation**]{.underline}. As Allison
points out, dwindling civic involvement, institutionalized corruption,
and a general lack of faith in politics are all concerning indicators of
the American democracy. Both countries\' leaders would do well to
emphasize their domestic issues by improving residents\' quality of
life. Finally, parties need to understand that hope is not a strategy.
[Allison views that if the USA hopes to avoid catastrophic war with
China while protecting and advancing American national interests,
lessons of the Cold War should be well studied]{.underline}. Both the
camps need to be aligned with strategic thinking rather than relying on
hope. (Allison, Avoiding the Thucydides Trap, 2018) Most of the scholars
view that, a new structure for the bilateral relationship is required,
taking into account key areas of rivalry and collaboration. Harvard
Professor Joe Nye expressed hope that the United States will have enough
time to handle China\'s ascent without falling into the second element
of the trap: overreaching out of fear (Coker, 2015). According to
Allison, [the US and China **have significant national interests in
preserving** the **survival** of their respective countries and must
work together to resolve concerns that have clouded the economic
relationship]{.underline}. This means coming up with new laws to account
for China\'s unparalleled economic growth and global power status. In
addition, policymakers should consider the appeal for a world that is
\"safe for variety\" followed by the \' Cuban Missile Crisis \'. This
development would allow countries with diverse political systems,
economic development methods, and philosophies to peacefully coexist
(Allison, Avoiding the Thucydides Trap, 2018).

### Hegemony bad -- China war

#### US hegemony will lead to escalatory war with China

1 The Pax Americana and the Cold War **[The American-led system has
secured a long Pax Americana in the sense that there have been no great
power wars and both Western Europe and East Asia have been largely
peaceful.]{.underline}** General public opinion in many countries
recognizes the benefits of this system. A Eurasia Group survey published
in April 2020 found that across Asian countries, with the exception of
China, 77% of respondents agreed that the United States would be
preferable as a global leader for their country and 79.1% of respondents
said that US leadership was better for the world overall. **[In China,
almost half the respondents said that US influence in the region was
very or somewhat negative with just 6.8% reporting a very positive
view]{.underline}**.1But, Americans themselves are even less favorable
to a US-led international order. In another Eurasia Group poll,
published November 2019, 57.6% of American respondents said that the US
should reduce its military presence in Asia while transitioning regional
allies to defend themselves. 47.1% said that the US should refrain from
military intervention when Americans are not directly threatened and
only 19.4% would support a US-led response to humanitarian abuses
abroad.2 **[The US was willing to maintain large military expenditures
and economic generosity to allies during the long cold war largely
because there was an enemy that was perceived to be evil]{.underline}**.
In his inaugural address on January 20, 1961, President John Kennedy
famously said: "Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill,
that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support
any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the
success of liberty." And, as Kennedy predicted, the Cold War cost the US
a lot of blood and treasure. The long wars in Korea, Vietnam, and, after
the Cold War, in the Middle East have cost trillions of dollars and many
lives. They have also had very damaging effects on US institutions and
culture. Are Americans willing to pay a huge price to protect an
international system if neither American interests nor core ideals are
at risk? The first Gulf War seemed to confirm the idea that future
military intervention by the US and its allies would be quick, easy, and
relatively painless. It created the illusion that the US military would
be able "to intervene easily, far from our homeland and close to the
homeland of our enemies."3 But, this dream that we were approaching
Frank Fukuyama's "end of history" did not last long.4 For a while, until
roughly 2010, it looked like the ideal international regime might exist
in East Asia. The US military in the region was so dominant that
intervention was unnecessary and many thought that the nations in the
region, especially China, would move toward liberal domestic regimes.
There are some vague ideas that there might be an EU-led system, but
that assumes that the world is a very peaceful place. In the early
1990s, there was a brief period where it looked like we might be
entering a world system resembling a European Union writ large: (1)
where military conflict looked impossible in much of the world, (2)
where US and allied military power was so overwhelming that police-like
actions could easily manage the rest of the world, (3) where
disagreements among nations were settled by multilateral rules-based
organizations, and (4) where the US/Western European democratic
capitalist system looked so superior that most of the world was expected
to converge on this model. None of those conditions holds true today. In
his well-known 2014 book Restraint: A New Foundation for U.S. Grand
Strategy, **[5Barry Posen ofMIT argued that liberal hegemonists believe
that "the United States can only be truly safe in a world full of states
like us..." In the early 2000s, many Americans believed that China was
on an inevitable path to become "like us" and thus was not an adversary.
But, now few American strategists see China on a this path and thus see
it as a strategic rival and probable future cold or hot
enemy.]{.underline}** The US has no vital interests in Asia in the sense
that the long-term livelihoods of average American people would be
drastically harmed if current ties with Asia were reduced. As Chinese
production has risen over the past 20 years, many Americans have gained
from cheaper imports of a large variety of goods, interest rates and
inflation rates have probably been reduced, and tech supply chains have
been optimized. But, going back to the trade status quo as of 1995 or
even 1975 would not be devastating to Americans. Many would gain as
factories moved to North America. In the very extreme case that all
trade would be cut off, mines in Nevada and other places would need to
reopen to supply so-called "rare" earths, raising gadget prices a bit. A
rational purely economic calculus of US interests would not find these
impacts to be worth fighting, or even risking, a war over. The major
issues at stake in Asia center on the economic interests of US allies
and on maintaining American liberal hegemony there, not on direct US
economic or homeland-protection interests. **[American military strategy
has long been based on the idea of force projection--- that US forces
have the capability to intervene all around the world. For decades, the
US could intervene in East Asia with little fear of being countered,
except in Korea.]{.underline}** As we saw in the 1996 Taiwan Straits
incident, the US could intervene without firing a shot, so there was
little danger of escalation. In the late 1990s, the US could thus
maintain a liberal hegemony regime in East Asia without too much risk or
expenditure and did not need an enemy to justify its military
expenditures. **[Now, US intervention in East Asia would be both highly
risky and vastly expensive. Recent Chinese investments in
"carrier-killer" missiles seriously weaken the US ability to project
power in seas adjacent to China. China often points out that it spends a
fraction on defense of what the US does, but that is irrelevant. The
strategic goals that each country hopes to achieve with its forces are
what is really relevant.]{.underline}** To reach its goals, the US has
to build and maintain the capability to project power across an ocean
and intervene against a Chinese military with rapidly rising power to
destroy US Navy ships. One danger is that we are getting into a
spiraling arms race. China is building anti-carrier weapons. Leading the
US to build up its forces. Leading to more Chinese arms expenditures and
a vicious cycle. **[Another danger is that neither side can predict its
own behavior or that of the other side if an incident occurs. If some
kind of incident occurs at sea, will China shoot at US carriers? What
happens if they sink one? Will the US attack missile batteries on
Chinese territory? The risks of unwanted war and escalation are very
real. Are these risks and costs worthwhile for the US? Probably not if
we are just propping up a vague international trading regime. But, the
American people can probably be convinced to support this strategy if
they can be convinced they are opposing another evil
empire.]{.underline}** Neither side appears to want this outcome. Almost
everyone in China recognizes that the country has benefited greatly from
US-led liberal hegemony in the region and that American military
withdrawal could make the region much more risky. But, most Chinese also
support the military buildup that is a factor in changing the system.
Would China really benefit from pushing the US out of East Asia?
Similarly, few in the US look forward to another cold war or more
military misadventures in Asia, but we seem to be adopting policies that
lead in that direction.

### Hegemony bad -- China heg good

#### The era of US hegemony is over -- China's rise presents a new and innovative way to address world challenges and initiate global cooperation

1.  Belt-and-Road Initiative good -- turns case

**Amineh 22** (Mehdi P. Amineh; writer from the University of Amsterdam,
"*The China-led Belt and Road Initiative and its Reflections:
Introduction*"
\[https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9781003256502/china-led-belt-road-initiative-reflections-mehdi-amineh?refId=7e0a77eb-04f7-401d-a835-e7d208a1e162&context=ubx\]
Accessed 7/7/22, TR)

In Chapter 8 Mehdi P. Amineh, Laura Linck, and Emre Demirkiran explore
the [**BRI** activities in Kazakhstan, Iran, and Turkey]{.underline}.
The authors analyze three key BRI member states: Iran and Turkey in the
Middle East and Kazakhstan in Central Asia. Each of these selected
countries has a substantial population and/or considerable territorial
expanse, and Iran and Kazakhstan have important hydrocarbon reserves.
Two of them, [Turkey and Iran, have relatively **diversified
industries**]{.underline}. Both are militarily active beyond their state
borders. Accordingly, the three countries have different external
policies. China needs to overcome differences among them by creating
enough common ground to induce regional governments to cooperate with
China's BRI. There are numerous publications on the origin, nature, and
activities of the BRI. However, [empirical case studies on the
opportunities and **challenges** for each of the countries along the BRI
are **limited**]{.underline}. The objective of this work is to fill in
that gap by investigating the BRI's activities in Kazakhstan, Iran, and
Turkey through a comparative case study. The theoretical orientation of
this work is founded on geopolitical economy. [This approach combines
states with cross-border, regional, and world economic processes in the
global political economy]{.underline}. This research argues that the
[engagement of Chinese companies in infrastructure development and the
energy sector in Kazakhstan, Iran, and Turkey not only **increases**
geo-economic **opportunities** for development **and cooperation** but
also increases China's geopolitical share of influence]{.underline}. In
Chapter 9, Hooman Peimani focuses [on **Iran** as a **re-rising** power
in Eurasia and West Asia with emerging claims to other regions. Iran is
now seeking to **restore its** historical **role as** the major Eurasian
cargo transportation **hub for econ**omic, political, and security gains
by expanding its influence in the regions of Western
interest]{.underline}. By sharply decreasing the transportation time
between Asia and Europe and also Africa to rival the currently used
Southern route via the Suez Canal, such a hub has the potential to
drastically reduce Iran's heavy reliance on oil and gas export revenues
and even possibly outshine them. Iran's strategic objectives coincide
with those of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and also Russia's
International North-South Transportation Corridor (INSTC), which became
a reality about two decades ago as a trilateral plan of Moscow, Tehran,
and New Delhi, and practically complements the BRI. Yet, the [full
realization of Iran's objective requires heavy investment in the Iranian
maritime and land transportation infrastructure by its Asian and
European beneficiaries]{.underline}, which have mostly been deterred by
the US-imposed sanctions on Iran. While the 2021 Vienna talks may not
end the sanctions, Iran's rampant state corruption and the undeclared
low-level war between Iran and Israel could further damage Iran's
objective, prospects which could be successful even if Iran's
transportation routes' current users continue and expand their use for
the bulk of their Asian-European trade. In Chapter 10, WANG Yongzhong
gives a survey of [**China's** worldwide **investments** **in** the
**energy** sectors **of BRI member states**]{.underline}. Based on the
project-level data from Dealogic, fDi Intelligence, and the American
Enterprise Institute and Heritage Foundation, the author conducts an
investigation into China's outward energy investment in the Belt and
Road countries in terms of the scale, industrial structure, geographical
distribution, main investors, mega-projects, and risk profile. [China's
outward energy investment has steadily **diversified from** the **fuel
energy** sector, particularly mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the oil
industry, into the electrical power generation sector.]{.underline} For
Chinese capital, [there is **no** obvious **difference in the risk** of
energy **investment** between BRI countries **and the rest of the
world**, and **actually** BRI countries' **risk is lower** than
average.]{.underline} It is worth noting that the share of troubled
Chinese energy transactions shows large fluctuations and has rebounded
strongly since 2016. Wang argues that it is expected that China's energy
sector M&A in BRI countries will lose momentum, while greenfield
investment in energy infrastructure has greater potential. In Chapter
11, XU Xiujun describes the possible impacts of the BRI on global
governance. According to the author, [global governance still faces the
problems and challenges of escalating global protectionism and
unilateralism, increasing challenges in global economic governance, and
declined or failed effectiveness of global governance mechanisms. Xu
presents the **BRI as a new platform for addressing global problems and
challenges through** **interconnection** and common development. In the
field of global governance, the **BRI** has **promoted** the conceptual
development and **innovation of global governance**, the
**coordination** and innovation of global governance mechanisms, and the
**achievement of new** **results in key areas** of global
governance.]{.underline} Under the new circumstances, in order to shape
new dynamics of global governance[, it is necessary to continuously
**create favorable conditions** and an environment **for BRI countries**
to participate in global governance, **consolidate their advantages** in
global development governance, and strengthen institutionalized BRI
cooperation.]{.underline}

### Europe NEG -- no backsliding

#### European democratic backsliding is exaggerated -- several indicators are trending up

Staffan I. **Lindberg '18**, July 4, the director of the Varieties of
Democracy (V-Dem) Institute and professor of political science at the
University of Gothenburg. "The Nature of Democratic Backsliding in
Europe," CARNEGIE EUROPE,
https://carnegieeurope.eu/2018/07/24/nature-of-democratic-backsliding-in-europe-pub-76868

[Europe has seen six shifts in regime classification over the past ten
years]{.underline}. Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia lost their
status as liberal democracies and transitioned downward to be electoral
democracies. Several of these transitions have been drawn out over
several years, but the autocratization of Poland is notably picking up
speed and most of the changes in Warsaw have occurred between 2015 and
2017.

[Fortuitously, [only one]{.mark} full [democratic breakdown has
occurred]{.mark} so far]{.underline}. In Serbia, autocratization has
gone so far that democracy is no longer upheld, even in its most limited
sense of electoral only. In another instance of slow-moving developments
where the government changed its nature in an incremental fashion over
many years, Serbia has become an electoral authoritarian state.

Only Albania has transitioned to a better state of affairs, now
qualifying as a liberal democracy.

Overall, the evidence points in the direction of democracy losing
significant ground in Europe.

WHAT IS CHANGING IN EUROPE?

V-Dem's data can also help identify which aspects of democracy are
diminishing and which are holding up more strongly. The index for
liberal democracy consists of the index for electoral democracy and
three indices capturing more specific liberal concerns: the protection
of civil liberties by the rule of law and both judicial and legislative
constraints on the executive.

The index driving most of the downward trend in recent years is the
measure of electoral democracy (see figure 3), which has registered the
largest drop between the various indices.

Plotting the twenty-five indicators that go into V-Dem's index of
electoral democracy shows the number of countries in Europe that have
significantly improved or declined on each indicator between 2007 and
2017 (see table 2).3

Notably, the indicators measuring the freedom of expression and
alternative sources of information have declined significantly in many
countries while improving in very few---just one country has seen
improved media self-censorship and two have seen less media bias in
favor of the government. In addition, indicators from the clean
elections index that measure civil society's ability to organize freely
without being repressed or prevented from existing also suggest
democratic backsliding.

At the same time, [[almost all indicators that measure]{.mark} purely
electoral aspects in the [clean elections]{.mark} index [show
improvement]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, [[the extent to which
the elections are free and fair in procedural terms and the quality of
the voters' registry---two of **the most fundamental
indicators**]{.mark} ­related to elections---[record **more countries
improving than declining**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This gives a detailed depiction of the current trend of democratic
backsliding in Europe. Some ruling elites are clearly on an undemocratic
quest, but [[the]{.mark} electoral [institutions that most observers
think of as representative of democracy have]{.mark} so far [been
**robust or**]{.mark} **even [improving]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Europe NEG -- coop limited

#### EU-US relations are dysfunctional -- no durable solvency

Transatlantic Agenda."
Intereconomics,<https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2021/number/1/article/eu-us-relations-reinventing-the-transatlantic-agenda.html>

[President Donald Trump's unabashed unilateralism has hurt
EU-[US]{.mark} relations. He [has called the E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion [a "foe" and "worse than China,]{.mark} just smaller"
(Kwong, 2018). He [celebrated Brexit and]{.mark} has [encouraged other
member states to leave]{.mark} the bloc. He has [bullied]{.mark}
democratic leaders such as [Angela Merkel and embraced autocrat]{.mark}s
like [Viktor Orbán]{.mark}. The latter has not helped the EU
institutions in their search for supranational mechanisms to enforce
compliance with rule of law conditions for membership.]{.underline}

[Not only did the 45th President of the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[refuse to re-engage with]{.mark} the transatlantic trade and investment
partnership [(TTIP)]{.mark} agenda, which Barack Obama abandoned, but he
also [imposed "national security" tariffs on]{.mark} steel and aluminium
imports from [European allies]{.mark} and threatened that more might
follow.]{.underline}1 [[He also subjected European businesses to
American]{.mark} extra-territorial [jurisdiction]{.mark} more
enthusiastically than any of his predecessors, in particular over his
withdrawal of the US from the Iran nuclear deal (see Stoll et al.,
2020).]{.underline}

[[Trump's retreat from the Paris climate deal]{.mark}, [the]{.mark}
[I]{.mark}ntermediate-[R]{.mark}ange [N]{.mark}uclear [F]{.mark}orces
[treaty]{.mark}, the [Open Skies agreement]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the
World Health Organization [(WHO)]{.mark} [as well as]{.mark} his
[attacks against the WTO]{.mark} appellate body [have rocked]{.mark}
many [Europeans' belief that they share common ground with]{.mark}
[their most important ally.]{.mark} In fact, [Trump has been disdainful
of European priorities]{.mark}, [from climate change]{.mark} and efforts
[to]{.mark} improve [global health]{.mark}, [to human rights]{.mark} and
development assistance.]{.underline}

[As a result[, **US relations with the EU have become largely
dysfunctional**]{.mark}**,** and this comes at a time when unprecedented
global health, economic and security challenges demand robust
transatlantic leadership.]{.underline}

[To be sure, **[transatlantic disarray is not solely due to
Trump]{.mark}**. After more than a decade of crisis management, [the EU
has seemed]{.mark} as [likely to fall apart as to come together
over]{.mark} the [COVID-19 pandemic.]{.mark} [The coronavirus crisis has
ravaged societies and economies]{.mark}. Whereas [EU member
states]{.mark} reached a political agreement on a historic recovery
package and a seven-year financial framework, those debates have also
[**revealed ongoing differences on rule of law conditionality**]{.mark}
in the disbursement of funding that could widen once the worst of the
pandemic is over.]{.underline}

### Democracy NEG -- NATO fails

#### Internal divisions prevent NATO from protecting democracy

Ashley **Parker**, Marianna **Sotomayor and** Isaac **Stanley-Becker
April 29**, 2022, "Inside the Republican drift away from supporting the
NATO alliance," THE WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/29/nato-republicans-trump/

But for some, the changes are not enough. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio),
who voted against the recent resolution, said he objected not to
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} but to its future direction, which in his
view [places too large a burden on the United States and [involves too
much promotion of specific values]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The resolution's affirmation of "unequivocal support" risks being
mistaken for unconditional support, Davidson said. When asked whether he
could envision the United States exiting the alliance --- as Trump
considered with former advisers --- Davidson said the real issue is
rather whether other member nations who are not spending sufficiently on
defense should leave the club.

"Is there a point where America would consider pulling out? It's
something we should discuss," said Davidson, an Army veteran who was
stationed in Germany when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. "The better
question is whether there's a point where we would say to other member
countries, 'This might not be your place --- you're disinvited.'"

Davidson said he objected in particular to the resolution's endorsement
of the Center for Democratic Resilience, which he called [[an "entity
**designed to meddle** in other countries' domestic
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}."

[[**Disagreements** have broken out among member nations over the
**erosion of democracy**]{.mark} within the alliance, [with criticism
directed]{.mark} in particular [at Turkey, Hungary and
Poland]{.mark}]{.underline}. A Central European diplomat said
[[objections]{.mark} to the democracy center [reflect admiration]{.mark}
for the likes of Hungary's Viktor Orban in other Western
nations]{.underline}.

## 

## Off-case

### DA UQ

#### Burden-sharing concerns mean summit commitments to expand military development are hollow

Thomas **Graham June 30**, 2022, "Did the summit reveal a newfound sense
of NATO unity?" COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS,
https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/nato-countries-signal-resolve-summit-what-does-it-mean-russia

**[[The summit was an impressive show]{.underline}]{.mark}** of resolve
to counter Russia's aggression, including through continued diplomatic,
economic, and military support for Ukraine. [[NATO pledged]{.mark} to
further expand its [military support]{.mark}]{.underline} for its
vulnerable allies along the Russian frontier. In particular, the United
States announced that it will establish a permanent headquarters for its
V Corps in Poland. Most important was the eleventh-hour agreement that
Turkey reached with Finland and Sweden, by which Ankara lifted its
objections to their joining the alliance and allowed NATO to begin the
accession process.

**[[However, challenges remain]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[**Burden-sharing** is a perennial issue]{.underline}]{.mark}: Even
after Russia's assault on Ukraine, [[the majority of members fall short
of their commitment to spend at least 2 percent]{.mark} of their gross
domestic product ([GDP) on defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. The laggards
include, most importantly, Germany, although it has taken steps recently
to meet that target as a multiyear average. Moreover, in the weeks
ahead, the alliance's resolve will be tested, as strains over rising
inflation and concerns over energy and food supply mount across the
Euro-Atlantic region. In recent weeks, France, Germany, and Italy have
expressed interest in finding a negotiated settlement to the conflict,
which would likely leave some seized Ukrainian territory in Russian
hands. That position is vehemently opposed by Poland and the Baltic
states, among others. Though [those [differences were pushed into the
background during this summit, they have not gone

[The [Madrid]{.mark} summit [was intended to be Nato's comeback]{.mark}

the legacy of Afghanistan while standing up to the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. [[Once one sifts the wheat from the chaff, however, there was
little of substance]{.underline}]{.mark}. The post-summit reality is
that [[Nato remains]{.underline}]{.mark} a dysfunctional alliance that

### NATO Focus DA UQ

#### NATO is focused on China -- cards about Russia don't disprove our DA because the threat response to both is interwoven

**Aljazeera June 30**, 2022 "NATO declares China a security challenge
for the first time,"
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/6/30/nato-names-china-a-strategic-priority-for-the-first-time

**[[NATO has listed China as one of its strategic
priorities]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the first time, [saying Beijing's
ambitions and its "coercive policies" challenge the Western bloc's
"interests, security and values]{.underline}".

[[The alliance's]{.mark} new [blueprint]{.mark}]{.underline}, or
Strategic Concept (PDF), that [lays out its priorities for the next
decade]{.underline}, was approved at a leader's summit in Spain on
Wednesday.

[The document [directed]{.mark}]{.underline} its harshest [[language
towards Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, which it described as "the most
significant and direct threat" to the alliance's peace and security,
[[but said Beijing's]{.underline}]{.mark} military ambitions, its
confrontational rhetoric towards Taiwan and its [increasingly close
[ties with Moscow posed "systemic challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}".

"China is substantially building up its military forces, including
nuclear weapons, bullying its neighbours, threatening Taiwan ...
monitoring and controlling its own citizens through advanced technology,
and spreading Russian lies and disinformation," NATO's Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg told reporters.

"China is not our adversary," he added, "but we must be clear-eyed about
the serious challenges it represents."

In response, China on Thursday said it "firmly" opposed NATO's
declaration, calling it a "completely futile" warning.

"NATO's so-called new strategic concept document disregards facts,
confuses black and white ... \[and\] smears China's foreign policy,"
foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said.

[[The official turn by NATO puts the world's largest military
alliance]{.mark}, based on the United States armed forces, **[on guard
against China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which has the world's
second-largest economy and a rapidly growing military, both in numbers
and in top-notch technology.

"One of the things that \[China's\] doing is seeking to undermine the
rules-based international order that we adhere to, that we believe in,
that we helped build," said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. "And
if China's challenging it in one way or another, we will stand up to
that."

Western leaders are concerned that Russia's aggression in Ukraine, which
China is yet to condemn, could embolden Beijing to be more assertive
over Taiwan. China considers Taiwan a part of its territory with no
right to independent recognition as a state or representation on the
world stage.

### CP -- EU: Biotech solvency

#### Europe is competitive in biotech and could become the industry star

Franck **Le Deu and** Jorge **Santos da Silva '19**, August 23, "Biotech
in Europe: A strong foundation for growth and innovation," MCKINSEY,
<https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/biotech-in-europe-a-strong-foundation-for-growth-and-innovation>

[[Biotech is entering its next S-curve of growth]{.mark} as companies
work to transform an array of innovations]{.underline}---gene therapies,
stem-cell treatments, antisense DNA, siRNA,1 CAR-T2 ---[into powerful
new therapeutic tools. Yet more scientific and technological
breakthroughs are on the horizon. [**Europe's role** in this industry
continues to grow, and the region leads in many ways]{.mark}. However,
[European companies have an opportunity to play an **even stronger
role**]{.mark} in the growth of an important and dynamic
industry]{.underline}.

This article shares highlights and reflections from our recent report on
Europe's biotech industry, Biotech in Europe: Scaling innovation, which
focused on these three questions: What makes European biotech
attractive, what financing does it need to fuel growth, and what should
biotech leaders and investors do to succeed?

What makes European biotech attractive?

Our research indicated that [[three factors make Europe's biotech market
attractive to investors: strong hot spots across geographies]{.mark},
modalities, and therapeutic areas; [powerhouse research and industry
expertise to support]{.mark} basic science and [innovation; and an
abundance of high-caliber talent]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### EU's new funding initiatives opens the door for EU tech dominance and innovation

**Korzekwa-Józefowicz 22** (Anna Korzekwa-Józefowicz; Communication
expert in the field of higher education and science; former spokeswoman
of the University of Warsaw, "*Quantum ideas are born in Europe*"
\[https://sciencebusiness.net/news/quantum-ideas-are-born-europe\]
Accessed 7/6/22, TR)

[**Europe** is remarkably **competitive in** terms of quantum
**tech**nologies, according to **QuantERA**, the largest European
quantum technology **research-funding** programme]{.underline}. Quantum
technologies harness the distinctive properties of quantum physics to
produce a functionality or performance which would be otherwise
unattainable. \"Many ideas and concepts in the field have emerged on our
continent", observes Professor Konrad Banaszek, the scientific
coordinator of QuantERA. As a case in point, he mentions research on
quantum communication and cryptography, such as next-generation quantum
communication protocols that guarantee secure data transmission even if
the exact characteristics of devices are not known. [Revolutionary
change Researchers argue that the advancement of quantum technologies
may also **lead to** revolutionary **change in** fields as diverse as
**medicine**, meteorology, **robotics**, banking and
**telecommunications**, as well as complex system
**simulation**]{.underline}. We can expect the advent of [new sensors,
detectors and more accurate clocks]{.underline}. Within the next twenty
years, s[ome of our medical diagnostic techniques will change;
procedures such as magnetic resonance will likely become **faster**,
**more accurate, cheaper** and less invasive]{.underline}. Quantum
technologies will also improve the sensitivity of detectors used to
sense gravitational waves. The great value and potential of the field
has not escaped the notice of governments across Europe; [various
countries have drafted national and domestic strategies for quantum
technology development]{.underline}. In 2018, [the European Commission
launched a ten-year programme known as the Quantum Flagship, which
consists of research institutions, industrial centres and
decision-makers working together to **help Europe emerge as a leader
in** quantum **tech**nologies]{.underline}. The QuantERA network was
established two years earlier; today, it brings together 39
research-funding agencies from the European continent, as well as Israel
and Turkey, and its mission is aligned with the long-term strategy
adopted by the European Union. A network of new ideas "Many research
problems cannot be studied or investigated in just one country; to
address them, you need the knowledge and experience of multiple teams.
[**QuantERA enables an influx of new ideas** within the field of quantum
technology]{.underline}", says Professor Banaszek. The network promotes
ambitious research into cutting-edge quantum technology engineering,
supports cooperation between researchers and research-funding agencies,
monitors actions and strategies in the field of quantum technology, and
drafts guidelines on responsible research. To date, QuantERA has
announced three calls (in 2017, 2019 and 2021) and funded 77 projects
that have involved 400 different research groups. The scope of research
eligible for funding under the programme is very broad, covering quantum
communication, quantum simulation, quantum computation, quantum
information sciences and quantum metrology sensing and imaging. Every
call announcement includes a declaration of openness to new initiatives.
"[All the new ideas that emerge in Europe, for which Europe is so well
known and appreciated around the world, have space to flourish
here]{.underline}. We provide a platform for communication between
researchers, create a forum for dialogue between them and
research-funding agencies, and offer funds to put their ideas into
practice", says Sylwia Kostka, a QuantERA coordinator. Kostka emphasises
that the network markedly strengthens European ties. "[The research
groups we bring together are so numerous that we are able to create a
truly European research space]{.underline}", she adds. Initially, the
network primarily funded basic research, but in the last call, grants
were also awarded to applied research projects. "[We really promote
basic research because the area is still so young. Especially since the
path from idea to implementation and to finished product can be really
short]{.underline}", says Professor Banaszek. Quantum random number
generators are one such example. First-generation devices are already
available; in the future, they may find applications wherever secure
communication is of the essence, including in critical infrastructure of
key importance to national security. Boosting European potential
QuantERA is an ERA-Net Co-fund initiative, co-funded by its member
agencies and the European Commission. Coordinated by the Polish National
Science Centre, the network sets out to promote the participation of
countries in which the level of research and innovation is below the EU
average (the so-called widening countries). "[The financial mechanism is
designed to **encourage cooperation** that breaks the mould and help
create research consortia with a **greater degree of
openness**]{.underline}", says Prof. Łukasz Rudnicki from the University
of Gdańsk, who coordinates a project entitled "Application-ready
superresolution in space and frequency", awarded funding under the
QuantERA programme in 2019. His research, which uses quantum
measurements methods to improve the resolution of optical devices, with
potential applications in astronomy (finding distant planets), aviation
technologies and spectroscopy (studying the chemical composition of
various substances), brings together partners from the Czech Republic,
Poland, France, Spain and Germany. "[QuantERA allows us to **tap the
potential of scientists from all over** Europe, as well as countries
that have a less-developed academic structure or have only recently
joined the EU]{.underline}. This is a great value of this programme",
explains Prof. Rudnicki. The next QuantERA call is scheduled for 2023.
If the network gets funding from the European Commission, yet another
will take place two years later. "[If we want Europe to **remain
competitive**, we need to secure further funding for
QuantERA]{.underline}", concludes Prof. Banaszek.

### CP -- EU: A2 "US key"

#### US regulation on biotech is contradictory and shaky; only international actors solve

**Cohrssen & Miller 18** (John J. Cohrssen; an attorney in private
practice, served in senior positions for the White House and for
Congressional Committees, Henry I. Miller; former FDA American medical

Accessed 7/6/22)

Blocking innovation / [The **FDA's failures** in both policy formulation
and in the actual reviews of the genetically engineered salmon and
mosquito resulted from empire‐​building, a lack of scientific expertise,
and deference to political pressure.]{.underline} [**In contrast, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture** has a **long history** with genetically
altered biocontrol agents, most notably the innovative screwworm fly
produced with sterile‐​insect techniques that was **success**fully
developed by the USDA more than 70 years ago to eradicate a devastating
animal pest. Since then, the USDA has performed, funded, and overseen
the testing and commercialization of a variety of control agents created
with sterile‐​insect techniques]{.underline}. (When released in large
numbers, insects made sterile---usually by irradiation---mate but don't
produce progeny, and thereby reduce wild insect populations.) [Largely
because of the **irrationality** and **unpredictability** **of U.S.
regulation**, industry has been reluctant to invest in these important
new approaches to the improvement of animal traits]{.underline}. The few
companies that have, besides AquaBounty and Oxitec, include
Recombinetics, which has produced hornless cows (an important
innovation), and Genus, which has developed pigs resistant to the
devastating Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus, the
cause of losses to U.S. pig farmers of more than \$600 million annually.
The foreseeable development of chickens with genetic resistance to avian
influenza will be a monumental breakthrough because there is no vaccine
against it and outbreaks result in the culling of tens of millions of
birds annually. These companies have the potential to create the Next
Big Thing in animal husbandry---if only innovation were not strangled by
unnecessary, misguided government regulation. The arrogation of
oversight over modern animal breeding by the FDA's Center for Veterinary
Medicine is an exemplar of the sort of regulatory overreach and
dysfunction that the Trump administration claims it wants to address.
[The White House Office of American Innovation, headed by Jared Kushner,
was established for this purpose. However, it has not focused on
biotechnology and it has a very limited staff]{.underline}. It will
likely fall to other entities in the White House to reassign oversight
of genetically engineered animals to more appropriate agencies. The USDA
has ample oversight authority over animal breeding under various
statutes, and certain other agencies also may have concurrent authority
over products such as pesticides (by the EPA) or particular food
products (by the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition). Such a
change would likely be broadly supported by academia, industry,
investors, and others who have been discouraged and frustrated by the
FDA's dysfunction and obstructionism. Withdrawing the FDA's "veterinary
drug" guidance and assigning jurisdiction over genetically modified
animals to the USDA and EPA would be a logical and important advance for
agriculture, the environment, and public health. All that is needed to
get it done is resolve from the feds. It can't happen soon enough.

### CP -- EU: China solvency

#### Structure can bring out Europe's edge on biotech -- they are positioned to out-compete China if they expand biotech coop

**Bayer '22**, May 24, "How Europe can become a leading biotech
hotspot,"
<https://www.bayer.com/en/news-stories/how-europe-can-become-a-leading-biotech-hotspot>

It is clear from the fight against the pandemic that [[Europe has
**extensive expertise** in]{.mark} the [biotech]{.mark} sector. We can
legitimately claim to hold a leading role. We have [a **diverse research
landscape**, and **state funding**]{.mark} of basic scientific research
[is excellent]{.mark}, [with almost half of the world's top 100 life
science universities located in Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}. According
to the Statista online portal, [[twice as many scientific papers
relating to biotech are published in Europe as in the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, with this figure rising to
[three times as many when compared to China]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Max Planck Institutes alone can boast 24 Nobel Prize winners among their
ranks.

[[Europe is]{.mark} clearly [a driver of innovation. The]{.mark} only
[**missing element** for harnessing this innovative strength in Europe
are **efficient structures**]{.mark}. That is what hamstrings promising
companies from emerging. Although we have plenty of inventiveness,
successfully commercializing good ideas often remains a
challenge]{.underline}. Here, Europe lags behind other parts of the
world -- especially the United States, the biggest biotech market, where
the most recent annual sales figure was a good 135 billion dollars.

The situation doesn't have to stay that way. I am convinced that
**[[Europe can become a biotechnology hotspot]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
For this to happen, we need to change key framework conditions. We need
to celebrate success not just in research, but on the market, too.

More Californian flair

The unprecedented speed at which an mRNA vaccine was developed was only
possible thanks to framework conditions that are not generally prevalent
in Europe under normal circumstances. The pandemic acted as a catalyst,
temporarily creating conditions in Europe similar to those found in
Silicon Valley, with key partners from industry, science, politics and
non-governmental organizations all uniting in pursuit of one goal -- the
fight against the pandemic. If Europe is to make the most of its huge
potential in biotechnology, we need more Californian flair and, above
all, a greater appetite for risk.

We should encourage young scientists with an entrepreneurial mindset to
find the courage to leave their university research institutes and found
companies instead. We need to support them -- not least as a way of
persuading them to stay in Europe. Cultivating a spirit of
entrepreneurship, combined with a greater tolerance for failure, is
essential.

We need more collaboration in Europe, too, and this is very much in
patients' interests. Cooperation between pharmaceutical and biotech
companies, science and regulators is working better under the conditions
of the pandemic than at any other time in history. [[It is]{.mark} now
[a case of making the most of]{.mark} this [momentum and
expanding]{.mark} it]{.underline}.

### CP -- EU: Bioterror solvency

#### EU solves for bioterror better -- U.S. doesn't have much to contribute

**Matthews 22** (David Matthews; experienced writer for the
Science\|Business news source, "*EU and US move to control risk of
dangerous pathogens escaping from labs*"
\[https://sciencebusiness.net/news/eu-and-us-move-control-risk-dangerous-pathogens-escaping-labs\]
Accessed 7/6/22, TR)

The Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense is a private organisation, so it
needs lawmaker and government buy-in to implement its recommendations.
But at least one of its ideas - expanding research into how to improve
lab safety - is now being worked on by White House science bodies. Last
month, a subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council,
which advises the US president, concluded that scientists simply lack
enough evidence to know how best to make labs safe and secure. Some labs
rely on "antiquated research" or "ad hoc protocols", warned the
committee's report, Evidence-Based Laboratory Biorisk Management Science
& Technology Roadmap. "The costs of not advancing the scientific
foundation for laboratory biorisk management are manifold---such as
increasing the risks of accidents, inadvertent exposures and releases by
using ineffective or outdated practices in life science laboratories,"
it warns. This doesn't just mean practical research into, say, how to
shower off pathogens when exiting a lab. The committee also thinks
scientists could benefit from sociological research into how academia
could become as safety conscious as the nuclear industry, for example.
Funding for biorisk research could be incorporated into grants, it
suggests, or new dedicated funding streams established. Scientists need
new ways of sharing what they have learned about lab safety, it says,
because existing ways of spreading knowledge, like publishing in a
journal, "face roadblocks surrounding reputational or liability
sensitivities." But for now, it appears that these recommendations and
discussions in the US have not translated into new lab safety
initiatives at individual universities or by regulatory bodies, at least
publicly. Asha George, executive director of the Bipartisan Commission
on Biodefense, said she was not aware of any such moves recently. "[The
**US** government **understands** the need for improving lab biosafety
and biosecurity]{.underline}," she said. [But it had **not** yet been
**able to create new programmes**]{.underline} "[that would
not]{.underline} [**overburden** research institutions]{.underline},"
George added. "There has been some talk of creating an independent
government agency to address lab biosafety and biosecurity over the past
few years, but [**nothing** yet has **come to fruition** in that
regard]{.underline}." The US National Science Advisory Board for
Biosecurity is also currently reviewing guidelines for so called "gain
of function" research, in which scientists make pathogens more risky in
the hope of understanding them better. [Meanwhile in the **EU**, lab
safety is to play a part]{.underline} -- albeit a small one -- [in the
bloc's **plan for future** pandemic **preparedness**]{.underline}. A
communication from [the European Commission]{.underline} released on 26
April [**calls on member states** to "conduct periodical reviews of
laboratory safety standards based on the lessons learnt from the
COVID-19 experiences, informing necessary revision, and strengthening
biosafety standards]{.underline}." A Commission spokeswoman did not
offer any more details on this instruction. But [the EU has **funded
preparedness projects**, for example, about pandemics caused by lab
accidents]{.underline}. And in China, the government has already taken
some steps to bolster lab safety and security, although it is unclear
how these have filtered down to lab practice on the ground. In 2020, it
introduced new biosecurity legislation, and in March this year the
country's powerful state council issued new guidelines on research
ethics that include injunctions to maintain "biological security."

### CP -- EU: A2 Perm

#### Perm fails: US-EU tech relations is historically zero-sum and hostile

1.  US-EU relations mirror an empire state governing over its
    peripheries, extracting resources for its own gain at the suffering
    of its constitutes, i.e. zero-sum

2.  Will eventually lead to the peripheries adopting new strategies to
    "catch up" with the center, forcing the empire to "demature" to
    restore the asymmetric balance of power

3.  Fire arg imo

[**[US and EU]{.mark}** trade **[relations historically]{.mark}** [have
been a]{.mark} short‐ run stable but [long‐run]{.mark} **unstable** [set
of **imbalance**s]{.mark}, in which the asymmetrical, somewhat
hierarchical structure of the US--EU relationship mixes with secular
trends to produce cycles marked by growing tensions and peri‐ odic
reconfiguration of the institutional structure regulating
trade]{.underline}. Put simply, [**[US]{.mark}** elites and many firms
[sit at the center]{.mark} of **an [empire‐like]{.mark}**, but decaying,
global **struc‐ ture of power**.]{.underline} A mixture of
institutionalized cooperation with some European (and Asian) elites and
with their militaries sustains this imperial structure. [All empires
[extract resources from their peripheries]{.mark} and all successful
empires balance **extraction with** the institutionalized **provision**
of order and the transmission of production and cultural
technologies]{.underline}. But **[balancing [creates a
dilemma]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Order, stability, and transmission
enable [[peripheries to catch up]{.mark} with the center]{.underline} in
economic and, potentially, military terms (Gilpin, 1981; Mann, 1986).
While catch‐up increases the vol‐ ume of resources the center can
harvest from the periphery, it also potentially **[creates [peer
rivals]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Imperial elites thus [must]{.mark}
periodically "[de‐mature]{.mark}" or reconfigure eco‐ nomic and military
power [to restore the asymmetries]{.mark} that enabled them to create
the empire in the first place]{.underline}. "Must," however, implies
neither "will" nor "will success‐ fully." Here the critical issue is
which firms and whose firms successfully capture the enhanced profits
associ‐ ated with the emergence and monopolization of new Schumpeterian
leading sectors after 1800, and whether a domestic political base
supports a given global order. Thus, geopolitical and domestic political
realities highly constrain state agency. This article thus surveys the
Braudelian longue duree rather than the "histoire evenementielle" of the
US--EU trade relationship, complementing Hjertaker and Tranøy (2022) on
the financial linkages and Kerremans (2022) on the narrower World Trade
Organization (WTO) insti‐ tutional structure. It does so to trace
structural eco‐ nomic changes occurring "behind the backs of actors"---
Max Weber's Auslese (Breiner, 2004)---as these strongly condition the
choice of options available to actors in the struggle for dominance of
social arenas in general and, given the focus of this article, markets
in partic‐ ular. Thus, like Smith (2022), the article addresses [the
structural changes in the global economy conditioning the US--EU trade
relationship over the post‐war period, rather than looking at
"operational" issues over a nar‐ rower time frame]{.underline}, such as
the workings of preferential trade agreements, the chronology of
specific decisions, or specific presidents. [The value added here is
identifying the [**longer‐term trends** **generating**]{.mark} broad
[**constraints** on]{.mark} national political
[actors]{.mark}]{.underline}---climate change around trade---so as to
avoid too much emphasis on idiosyncratic decisions attached to
particular political personalities---the weather. As such, explicit
discussions of agency largely drop out for reasons of parsimony. The
article thus provides one concrete dimension of the more general
framework presented by Smith (2022). In particular, where the data are
available, the article focuses on two key bases for economic power:
looking backwards, the distribution of global profit in the past 16
years, and, looking forward, the distribution of R&D efforts about
present and emerging industries. Section 2 elaborates the analytic
frame. Sections 3 and 4 respectively explore EU--US relations in the
auto‐ mobile and petroleum/Bretton Woods 1 era, roughly 1950 to 1980,
and then the information and communi‐ cation technologies (ICT)/Bretton
Woods 2 era, roughly 1980 to 2010. Section 5 discusses the state of play
after the 2008--2010 financial crises, focusing on R&D. Section 6
concludes, with particular attention to the questions raised in the
thematic issue introduction.

more attention to security issues and competitiveness in China-EU
relations]{.underline}. However, [geopolitics and security are not its

### CP -- NATO Fund

#### Text: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization should assemble and fund a technology bank focused on biotechnology with an emphasis on resilience as a core concept.

#### A NATO bank will address the tech gap between alliance members and solve any finance management 

**Bergmann, 21** (Max Bergmann, Max Bergmann is the director of the

\"NATO's Financing Gap\",
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/natos-financing-gap/)-JLI

In 2014, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and seizure of Crimea,
NATO leaders met in Wales for a critical summit. Since the end of the
Cold War, and especially following 9/11, the alliance had shifted its
focus from its traditional mission of defending Europe to operations
abroad. Meanwhile, [NATO members significantly reduced defense spending,
downsized their forces, and underinvested in modernizing their forces
following the Cold War. However, Russian aggression against Ukraine
shook the allia]{.underline}nce; NATO leaders agreed in Wales that
defending Europe would be a top priority and committed to spending at
least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024.[1 This
pledge was seen as a massive step forward for the alliance, as it would
serve to address a growing gap in its capabilities. Since the summit,
some progress has been made in strengthening the alliance. NATO members
have increased defense spending, deployed forces in Central and Eastern
Europe, and begun investing in needed capabilities]{.underline}. In
2019, almost all NATO allies increased their defense spending, with nine
countries hitting the 2 percent goal.2 Most allies have put plans in
place to substantially increase defense spending by 2024.3 The alliance
is stronger and better prepared to deter Russia than it was six years
ago, despite the divisive approach of President Donald Trump, but
significant gaps remain. Marginal spending increases by various NATO
members were inherently fragmented and often yielded few new major
capabilities or failed to address some of NATO's serious shortfalls.
Meanwhile, many member states still have yet to adequately invest in
their forces, leading to very low states of readiness and operational
strain. [Lack of progress toward the 2 percent benchmark has also caused
major diplomatic tension within the alliance between the countries
meeting their commitments and those that are not.]{.underline}4 Now,
with the COVID-19 crisis hammering the balance sheets of all NATO
members, the prospect for European defense spending looks bleak.[5 It
seems unlikely that there will be significant new investment to address
some of NATO's critical capability gaps. Indeed, the European
Union]{.underline}---which had planned to increase funding to upgrade
the dual-use infrastructure critical to moving NATO forces---has
[reduced its planned allocations in its recent budget.6 NATO members
seeking to keep their economies alive are unlikely to prioritize
defense. This is a serious problem for the alliance, and NATO needs to
think more creatively about how to support continued alliance investment
in the wake of the massive economic contraction]{.underline} caused by
COVID-19. Simply demanding that countries spend more on defense, which
was not very effective prepandemic, will certainly not work now. What
has become apparent is that NATO's default focus on individual
nation-state spending commitments was doing little to address
alliancewide issues. Collectively, European NATO members spend as much
on defense as Russia, yet the disaggregated and loosely coordinated
spending by individual states means that the alliance's combat strength
is well short of what it could be and has left critical gaps in its
capabilities. [NATO, since its founding, has lacked the resources to
fill gaps and make investments. The alliance has overlooked one of its
potentially most powerful assets---the collective economic and financial
clout of its members. NATO has not leveraged its collective financial
stature and the position of its many wealthy members to shore up the
allianc]{.underline}e. In the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, this must
change through the creation of its own bank. **[A NATO bank would
resemble other multilateral financial institutions but focus on allied
defense priorities.]{.underline}** A NATO bank, while new for the
alliance, would emulate the structure of other multilateral lending
organizations. Yet instead of focusing on providing financing for
international development as, for example, the World Bank does, it would
focus on the defense sector to prompt defense modernization and fund
multilateral investments. [A NATO bank would leverage the
creditworthiness of its wealthy members, enabling it to provide
attractive low-interest, long-term loans to members lacking the
resources to invest in critical alliance capabilities]{.underline}. For
example, former Warsaw Pact NATO members face substantial challenges in
retiring old Soviet-Russian weapons systems with new Western-made
equipment, and many more have failed to build up and modernize their
infrastructure and technology capabilities.7 This is not because NATO as
a whole lacks the resources but because individual NATO members lack the
resources. This, however, makes the alliance overall considerably weaker
than it could be**[. The bank could finance efforts to address critical
gaps that might fall through the seams of the alliance, such as
modernizing dual-use infrastructure]{.underline}**. This could entail
upgrading bridges to support heavy military vehicles transit from west
to east or investing in secure 5G technology. **[A NATO bank could
provide an alternative to nations and regions turning to banks and
lending institutions tied to NATO's competitors, such as China and
Russia.]{.underline}** A bank could provide NATO with an important tool
to safeguard its access to dual-use infrastructure and strengthen ties
with non-NATO member states that are critical to the security of Europe,
such as in the Balkans. In a new era of geopolitical competition, a NATO
bank could serve as a critical tool. A **[NATO bank would better equip
the alliance to manage the financial challenges of
conflict.]{.underline}** By not taking into account how to finance the
alliance, NATO has not adequately prepared itself for a military
conflict. [NATO does military planning for all sorts of contingencies,
but it does not plan for how to finance these efforts in the event of a
conflict.]{.underline} Yet underlying any significant military effort
are questions of economic and financial capacity. [Military conflict and
competition put great economic strain on a nation or power, stressing
national budgets and often causing painful and unpopular economic
choices]{.underline}. Yet as the NATO alliance has developed and
solidified over the past 70 years, it has not organized itself to
grapple with these fundamental questions: Who will finance the alliance?
How will that be done? While the United States has traditionally stepped
in, many of NATO's European members also possess immense financial
resources and standing. The alliance does not need to rely solely on the
dollar; it can now also rely on the euro as well as the pound. The
burden of financing the alliance should not be an American
responsibility or fall on the shoulders of select member states but
rather be considered a shared responsibility. [To establish the bank,
wealthier members would need to provide initial startup capital, while
member states that are the intended recipients for loans would need to
agree to participate.]{.underline} NATO allies would set priorities for
what the bank should fund, seeking to balance the need to address urgent
critical shortfalls with longer-term priorities such as investing in new
dual-use technology. The bank would finance NATO priorities, such as
defense modernization within the alliance, with a focus on joint
acquisitions and replacing outdated Soviet-Russian equipment; strategic
investments in dual-use infrastructure; investments in emerging
technologies such as 5G development; and crisis response funds. After
the turmoil of the Trump administration, there will likely be
significant energy on the part of NATO members to embrace new ideas to
revive and renew the alliance. The Biden administration should seize the
moment and push for NATO to announce the creation of a new bank at the
first leaders' summit. A NATO bank could also serve as a critical tool
in the short term by helping to alleviate budgetary pressure caused by
the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, a NATO bank
would not magically solve all issues or fill all regional capabilities
gaps. It will not solve the budgetary crunch caused by COVID-19. Some
members may continue to resist making investments, even if offered
extremely low borrowing costs from NATO, and may need institutional
pressure and evidence to incentivize an initial buy-in. Yet others will
take advantage, especially if the United States were to shift its
diplomatic energy from demanding arbitrary spending targets to
supporting specific investments that allow capability gaps to be filled.
[A bank would be a flexible tool that could evolve with NATO priorities
and leverage the alliance's financial clout to strengthen the security
of all members. Strengthening the NATO alliance---the foundation for
European security and the trans-Atlantic partnership---is absolutely
essential. As such, NATO needs to get more innovative in how it seeks to
address its shortfalls.]{.underline}

\"NATO's Financing Gap\",
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/natos-financing-gap/)-JLI

Finance and defense: [A critical link Critical to any alliance war
effort is the ability to mobilize national resources to finance and fund
a prolonged military campaign, not just of an individual nation but also
of its allied partners.]{.underline} [The history of military alliances
is often inextricably linked to the ability of allies to financially
support each other]{.underline}. During World War I, Allied forces were
reliant on American financier J.P. Morgan to finance the Entente's war
effort. Historian Adam Tooze explains, "By the end of 1916, American
investors had wagered two billion dollars on an Entente victory. The
vehicle for this transatlantic operation...was a single private bank,
the dominant Wall Street house of J.P. Morgan."8 J.P. Morgan's efforts
were driven in part by business interests and in part by support for the
Entente. Tooze concludes, "The result was a quite unprecedented
international combination of public-private power." During the Battle of
the Somme in the summer of 1916, J.P. Morgan spent more than \$1 billion
in the United States on behalf of the United Kingdom, amounting to more
than 45 percent of U.K. war spending.9 These examples demonstrate the
financial underpinnings of any massive allied military endeavor**[. When
states enter into a conflict, they are often willing to spend whatever
it takes financially---and states that lack the capacity to finance or
support their efforts often flounder]{.underline}**. Tooze explains that
[while the Entente could rely on the United States providing needed
supplies]{.underline} for the home front, especially food and coal,
**[Germany could not,]{.underline}** [which he argues was "an essential
factor in deciding the eventual outcome."]{.underline}10 Furthermore,
during WWII, the United States provided military aid through the
Lend-Lease Program, significantly bolstering British and Soviet
forces.11 The United States provided more than \$500 billion in
equipment such as tanks, fighter aircraft, and ships, but the repayment
plan for these "leased" items had an extremely long-term time horizon.
The United Kingdom did not fully pay back the United States until
December 29, 2006.12 Despite the issues of war financing being critical
to any military effort, [NATO as an established military alliance has
not accounted for how to finance a broader and more protracted
alliancewide military effort. Nowhere in its organization is there a
defined financing vehicle to initiate investments in defense or to
sustain the alliance and its members]{.underline}. [Countries' finance
ministers have little, if any, role or engagement with NATO. Should a
member state fall under attack and need an urgent injection of financing
to keep soldiers paid or acquire defense equipment and other critical
supplies, this would need to be done outside of the existing alliance
structure, likely on a bilateral or ad hoc basis.]{.underline} While
unlikely, the potential lack of a defined finance vehicle or structure
underscores the need for NATO to prepare for such contingencies. **[The
United States as NATO's financial backbone NATO has operated on the
assumption that its most powerful member, the United States, would play
the same role it had during the first two world wars.]{.underline}** [In
the years after WWII, the United States pushed to rebuild Europe, both
economically and militarily. While the Marshall Plan provided critical
economic assistance, the United States also effectively financed the
military reconstruction of Western Europe]{.underline}. Through the 1949
Mutual Defense Assistance Act and the 1951 Mutual Security Act, the
United States provided more than \$50 billion in today's dollars in
military aid to the newly formed NATO.13 When NATO was formed, it was
seen as a way of keeping Americans engaged in Europe and preventing the
United States from reverting to a post-WWI isolationism. But the United
States was also focused on encouraging European rearmament and reducing
reliance on the United States, which led to strong early U.S. support
for European defense restructuring and integration[. U.S. efforts to
spur rearmament, particularly in West Germany, were a crucial motivating
factor for France to push for European integration through the merging
of the coal and steel industries into the European Coal and Steel
Community]{.underline}.14 The United States also strongly backed a
French proposal to create a European Defense Community (EDC), which
would have formed a pan-European army.15 In the aftermath of WWII, the
[United States therefore sought and encouraged ways to spur European
defense reforms in an effort to strengthen the European pillar of the
newly formed alliance, which would have reduced Western Europe's
military and economic reliance on the United States]{.underline}.
Ultimately, however, the EDC never took hold and a European Army was
never formed. Europe integrated economically, but not militarily.
Defense was left to nation-states, coordinated through NATO, leaving the
United States not only as the lead military guarantor of European
defense but also as its de facto financial backbone. [As Western Europe
recovered economically, individual NATO members took on responsibility
for financing and sustaining investments in their military
capabilities]{.underline}, which [led to U.S. concerns]{.underline}
during the Cold War [about European underinvestment]{.underline} [in
defense]{.underline}.16 However, the United States' military presence in
Europe and focus on the Soviet Union meant that it made up for whatever
European military deficiencies may have existed. After the Cold War,
unlike after WWII, the United States and many NATO members cut defense
spending, taking the so-called peace dividend. However, NATO
simultaneously expanded eastward, incorporating numerous Warsaw Pact
countries. These former Warsaw Pact members had militaries that had been
designed and built with the purpose of operating with the Soviet Union
against the alliance. Additionally, [and similar to NATO's founding
members after WWII, these nations lacked the financial wherewithal to
rebuild their militaries]{.underline}. [Yet unlike after WWII, the
United States made no significant investment to rebuild and transform
the militaries of these new members states. When NATO was called on in
Afghanistan after 9/11, it was the United States that, through coalition
support funds, provided funding and assistance to encourage, support,
and sustain member state operations in Afghanistan.17 Following Russia's
invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the alliance recognized the need for urgent
investment to deter Russia. Members pledged to spend more, and the
United States established the European Reassurance
Initiative]{.underline}, now called the European Deterrence
Initiative.18 The European Deterrence Initiative provided tens of
billions of dollars to bolster NATO's capacity to deter Russia. [It
invested in modernizing and expanding military facilities, provided
training assistance to forces, and funded the development of military
capabilities.19 This American effort has been significant in bolstering
NATO's overall strength**. Once again, it was an example of the United
States stepping in financially to fill a gap in the
alliance.**]{.underline} Yet this investment initiative was also
limited**[. U.S. funding has recently focused on encouraging the
modernization of Eastern European militaries, but this U.S.-dependent
effort is limited in scope, particularly given current budgetary
constraints]{.underline}**. For instance, although the U.S. State
Department will likely continue to provide some funds to strengthen the
security and resilience of Eastern NATO members, this is not enough to
finance the large acquisitions needed to modernize their forces.

#### NATO bank solves the tech gap between member, improve military defense across alliances and promote better security cooperation among members 

**Bergmann, 21** (Max Bergmann, Max Bergmann is the director of the

\"NATO's Financing Gap\",
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/natos-financing-gap/)-JLI

What would a bank do? Addressing NATO's capabilities gaps After decades
of underinvestment, and as a result of its focus on counterterrorism and
counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, NATO and its
members have a number of critical gaps in conventional capabilities to
deter peer competitors. Although a bank would not solve all of the
alliance's problems---which include ongoing reliance on aging equipment,
chronic infrastructure shortfalls, and gaps in defense spending---many
of these areas could be addressed by the creation of this new funding
mechanism. **[Reduce reliance on aging Soviet-Russian military
equipment]{.underline}** As NATO has pivoted back to a focus on
deterring Russia[, one great irony is that former Warsaw Pact NATO
members continue to use and operate aging Soviet-Russian
equipment.]{.underline} Not only is [much of this
equipment]{.underline}---from fighter jets to tracked vehicles to
helicopters---[in a decrepit state well below the standards of NATO's
Western members,]{.underline} but the continued use of this equipment
also creates a dependence on Russia's defense industry, as keeping aging
equipment operating requires that these countries procure spare parts
and components from Russia itself.21 [This means that NATO defense funds
are flowing to the Russian defense industry to enable NATO's Eastern
members to operate equipment to deter Russian aggression]{.underline}.
Such spending also violates U.S. sanctions provisions under the
Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which became law
in 2017.22 [Former Warsaw Pact countries never received an injection of
financing to modernize their forces after joining NATO.
Unlike]{.underline} after WWII, when the United States helped rebuild
allied European militaries to deter the Soviet Union, there was no
similar pressing threat that warranted massive military expenditures
after the end of Cold War. Modernization and the replacement of aging
fleets has happened slowly and sporadically. Additionally, the focus on
counterinsurgency missions in Afghanistan and Iraq further reduced
investment in higher-end military equipment useful for deterring a
peer-to-peer competitor. [It is clearly past time for NATO's Eastern
members to modernize their forces with equipment interoperable with NATO
forces. However, expecting individual countries to do this themselves is
unrealistic]{.underline}. Many of NATO's Eastern members have increased
their defense spending following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and have
taken action to defend themselves and deter potential aggression.
Poland, for instance, has invested in a broad-based modernization
effort, procuring the Patriot missile defense system as well as new
helicopters.23 Romania has acquired used F-16s from Portugal.24 Yet
these efforts are piecemeal and disconnected from each other. Moreover,
these countries are simply not going to be able to modernize their
forces without access to considerable financing. Just as a homeowner
would seek a loan to renovate their house or a mortgage to enable them
to purchase a house, countries need access to advantageous financing to
facilitate the significant investments needed to modernize their forces.
[**Solve infrastructure shortfalls** A major military weak spot for the
alliance is its inability to move forces quickly and efficiently across
the European continent,]{.underline} namely from west to east. [Russia
has an immense tactical military advantage by being able to amass forces
on its territories, giving it the potential to overwhelm the forces of
an individual NATO member state,]{.underline} particularly the Baltic
states. NATO defense planners would seek to move forces eastward should
tensions escalate. But the alliance would face significant difficulty
simply moving forces from west to east, as numerous bridges, roads, and
rail lines cannot handle the transit of heavy military equipment such as
tanks. Although NATO has recently made progress in lowering the barriers
to cross-border operations, officials reportedly remain concerned that
requirements such as passport checks or outdated infrastructure could
stall any coordinated response to a threat within Europe.25 Recognizing
this barrier, the EU unveiled a "military Schengen zone" in 2018 with
the goal of lowering barriers to moving troops and equipment across
Europe and fixing existing infrastructure to withstand this sort of
movement.26 As a first step, [NATO would need host members to make the
necessary infrastructure investments. Yet the purpose of these
investments is for the sake of the whole alliance, not just the member
state making the investment. Hence, progress in addressing this
significant military gap---the inability to mobilize and transport
forces to the fight---has been shockingly slow. This clear gap is
perhaps the most substantial risk to NATO's ability to defend
allied]{.underline} territory and highlights the urgent need for an
injection of funding. [Additionally, NATO may also want to finance
investment in infrastructure that is critical to the military capacity
of the alliance. This could mean improving ports, power plants, and
other rail and road infrastructure. In particular, as potential rivals
like China provide investment and take controlling stakes in critical
infrastructure including electrical plants and ports]{.underline}---such
as the Port of Piraeus in Greece---NATO has a clear stake in ensuring
that infrastructure critical to the operations of the alliance remain
under member control. Furthermore, NATO could help solve the alliance's
5G problem. 5G networks are largely for civilian purposes but also have
a dual-use military dimension in order to support alliance
communications. As concerns mount over the security of potentially
Chinese-provided 5G communications networks, NATO could help invest in
the formation of a secure 5G network that meets alliance security
requirements.27 [**Invest in new and emerging technologies** Rapid
technological change is transforming warfare]{.underline}. Yet
acquisition cycles for procuring new weapons systems are often so
lengthy that, by the time of delivery and deployment, the technology has
already changed. NATO should support more dynamic procurement efforts,
particularly when it comes to defensive systems that could be used to
complicate and deter Russian or nation-state incursion. [Additionally,
NATO should be investing in new technology development and other
research that can help spur innovation to bolster the alliance. This
could involve providing funding to startups or providing capital to
expand ongoing research and innovation.]{.underline} Once the bank is
established, its mandate could even expand to include venture efforts
that directly fund cutting-edge technology. This effort could also be
closely coordinated with the EU. **[Show support for sustaining defense
spending levels]{.underline}** Although member states agreed to increase
defense spending at the Wales Summit, progress has been slow and
sporadic, and a majority of NATO members were unlikely to hit the 2
percent pledge by 2024. This is even more unlikely now with the economic
and budgetary fallout from COVID-19. Some NATO members may face severe
budgetary shortfalls, making defense spending a potential target for
budget cuts. To relieve this pressure, NATO members could use access to
inexpensive financing to maintain their current defense spending levels.
[**Close the gap in NATO's defense planning** NATO not only needs to be
militarily prepared for protracted conflict scenarios but also should be
financially prepared. The alliance should not assume or place the burden
of financially backing a massive regional effort on the shoulders of the
United States; other NATO members would need to step up as
well.]{.underline} But instead of figuring out such financial
arrangements in the midst of a crisis, [NATO should plan now. If member
states are going to fight together, then determining how to finance that
effort is critical. A NATO bank should help prompt collaboration and
coordination among the formation's finance ministers and treasury
secretaries, which will better prepare the alliance to cope in the event
of a conflict]{.underline}.

Act To Avoid A Biotechnology Arms Race\",

Biotechnology's moment is here. [The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated
an international race for a vaccine, pushing the limits of how quickly
countries can employ biotechnology to develop, trial, and mass-produce a
solution to the novel coronavirus. **Investing in biotechnology is now
slated to remain a top priority for nation-states for the foreseeable
future.**]{.underline} Even before the pandemic, states were waking up
to the potential of biotechnology to transform medical research, crop
production, and the environment. [Renewed attention to biotechnology
comes alongside an old geopolitical environment also made new, or great
power competition between Russia, China, and the United
States]{.underline}. Joining the ranks of strategic competitions in
artificial intelligence, cyber, and space technology, a biotechnology
arms race could result in new anxieties over dual-use applications in
tandem with bolstered biodefense regimes. The COVID-19 pandemic will
undoubtedly alter international biodefense efforts such as pandemic
preparedness and response. But states should be wary of expanding
biodefense infrastructure without properly addressing advancements in
biotechnology that could inflate the "gray zone" of biodefense. The
unclear distinction between offensive and defensive work, or dual-use
technology, that is imbedded in the nature of the biodefense task means
states have to consider the capabilities and intentions of their
adversaries, which are all the more unclear in a great power
competition. Old dogs, new tricks. The perceived threat of new
gene-editing technologies such as Crispr, coupled with advancements in
synthetic biology, has not gone unnoticed. Crispr is a relatively cheap
and efficient genome editing tool that allows scientists to modify and
permanently alter DNA and RNA. Crispr is utilized in research on the
treatment of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, heart disease, and even
HIV. A biotechnology tool with clear promise, concerns over Crispr are
rooted in fear of unintended consequences, and in the potential for
nefarious actors to weaponize deadly pathogens. Concerns over synthetic
biology, the broad term used to describe the construction of new
"biological entities" from scratch, cite similar worries over how an
adversary could manipulate this new technology. [In the 2018 National
Defense Strategy (NDS) that laid the conceptual foundations for the
revival of great power competition,]{.underline} the United States named
biotechnology as a technology that alters the rapidly changing security
environment, providing wider accessibility of potential weapons to more
actors. [The U.S. director of National Intelligence first included
genome editing in a 2016 threat assessment, signaling the potential of
dual-use biotechnology to have national security implications if
deliberately or unintentionally misused. More recently, the United
States listed China, Russia, and Iran as countries engaged in dual-use
biotechnology research with potential, but unconfirmed, implications for
the Biological Weapons Convention, or the BWC.]{.underline} The 2020
report also included a direct indictment of North Korea as a country
with an offensive biological weapons program. This apprehension goes
both ways. General fears concerning the development of "genetic weapons"
have appeared in official Russian military rhetoric throughout the last
two decades. In 2006, [Russia submitted a paper to the Sixth BWC Review
Conference on the possibility of advancements in technology leading to
the creation of "ethnic weapons." President Vladimir Putin has made
statements on the potential of biotechnology to transform weapons and
defense]{.underline}. Russia's 2015 National Security Strategy
highlighted the threatening presence of U.S. military-biological
laboratories on Russian borders as well as the importance of developing
critical technologies such as genetic engineering for national security
purposes. China and Russia's commitment to a high-tech partnership could
also contribute to the perceived ambiguity over dual-use biotechnology.
The two countries agreed to collaborate on the advancement of
technologies such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and
biotechnology, as a means to strengthen their "strategic partnership."
But both China and Russia have signaled a willingness to engage
bilaterally with the United States on biotechnology innovation, which
could help promote transparency. China bolstered its investment in
biotechnology as a part of the Made in China 2025 campaign, which
benefitted U.S.-based biotechnology firms on the receiving end of
increased funding in 2018. That same year, the U.S. Committee on Foreign
Investments (CFIUS) added biotechnology to a list of industries with
restricted foreign direct investment, predominantly to curb Chinese
investment and protect intellectual property. Instead of promoting
scientific exchange and collaboration, this decision may have made
international biotechnology research more opaque. The U.S. military's
investment in biotechnology for biodefense also doesn't provide the
needed assurance to assuage state fears over dual-use research. The
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA's, interest in
utilizing biotechnology for the improvement of the warfighter, along
with initiatives to enhance textiles and amend supply chain
vulnerabilities using synthetic biology could contribute to the
biotechnology ambiguity dilemma. That states are threatened by the
potential dual-uses of biotechnology is clear, but how much they are
willing to reveal about their own capabilities is less certain. New
avenues for discussion are badly needed. The role of the BWC. **[The
threat of dual-use biotechnology has occupied the imaginations of state
parties to the Biological Weapons Convention since its inception in
1975. Now past its forty-fifth anniversary, the BWC institutionalized a
norm against the use, development, and stockpiling of biological
weapons. Review conferences, held every five years, were created in part
to address new developments in science and technology as they pertain to
the authority of the convention. Annual intersessional meetings for
continuing discussions between BWC review conferences were added in
2007,]{.underline}** but their productivity has been questionable**[. A
2016 study following the progress of science and technology discussions,
one of the intersessional agenda items for the 2012-2015 period, found
that an average of only 4.5 hours a year was devoted to the
topic.]{.underline}** The 2016 review conference was prepared to address
developments in science and technology in its final report, but the
Iranian delegation refused to advance discussions unless member states
agreed to return to protocol negotiations (a strategy that some analysts
believe was a protest of the continued sanctions on its nuclear
program). Efforts to introduce a verification protocol to monitor
compliance with the BWC collapsed in 2001, and lack of a binding
enforcement mechanism in the convention is often cited as the BWC's
biggest shortcoming. Iran's uncooperative stance prevented state parties
from producing a consensus document at the end of the review conference
and establishing an intersessional program of work. As a result, the
2017 Meeting of State Parties was used for this purpose, and substantive
discussions were delayed until 2018. While states did briefly discuss
the dangerous potential of advancing biotechnology applications in their
2018 and 2019 meetings, any definitive agreements will have to wait for
the 2021 review conference. Shrinking the gray zone. It is not
surprising that a flood of analyses and op-eds are considering how the
pandemic might compare to or inspire the use of sophisticated biological
weapons, despite its natural origins. [COVID-19 has certainly provided a
partial answer to a question undoubtedly asked by BW "red teams" for
decades: what could a global pandemic do to the international order and
the stability of nation-states? Malicious actors need not imagine the
consequences]{.underline}. That the U.S. State Department overtly
implied the possibility that the [COVID-19 virus was intentionally
released from a Chinese lab highlights the diplomatic challenges of
addressing a biological event, and the need to establish working
pathways to avoid escalation]{.underline}. Addressing and
institutionalizing the analysis of biotechnology is the necessary first
step toward ensuring state parties remain in sync on the changing
relationship between biodefense, biotechnology, and pandemic response.
As a catalyst for change, the COVID-19 pandemic could push states to
make real progress in the 2021 review conference, but not without
productive Meetings of Experts and State Parties beforehand. Originally
scheduled to occur in August and December 2020, respectively, the two
intersessional meetings have been moved to December 2020 and April 2021
because of the pandemic, with the Ninth Review Conference still
scheduled to take place the following November. [At a minimum, states
need to be prepared to imbed a permanent biotechnology working group
into the convention to continually address and evaluate the impact of
new technology. Otherwise, questions over whether new developments in
synthetic biology are covered by the convention will continue to make
states worried about their adversaries research developments, which
could further encourage a biotechnology arms race]{.underline}. **[The
biggest challenge for]{.underline}** the 2021 review **[conference will
be getting member states on the same page]{.underline}**. The global
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will undoubtedly affect discussions and
augment nations like Iran's push for a verification protocol. States
aren't likely to build a consensus on this contentious issue before the
next review conference, and time spent on this issue will be wasted.
States can't wait another five years to address the rapidly changing
pace of biotechnology. The protocol question needs to be put on hold.
[States also shouldn't avoid addressing the inevitable overlap between
responding to natural versus intentional biological
episodes]{.underline}. Russia has maintained that discussing natural
epidemics has no role at the BWC, but because **[strengthening
biodefense is the best response to both problems, bolstering biodefense
without dialogue creates a precarious security environment. Clarifying
the intersection between natural and deliberate pandemic response could
help states gage how their own biodefense efforts complement
international biodefense coordination]{.underline}**. If states better
understand their national role and responsibilities in the international
biodefense regime, they will be less inclined to pursue unilateral
defense initiatives with obscure research trajectories.

longstanding stalemate of the Convention in order to meet evolving
biological threats stemming from state and non-state actors and to
address new developments in science and technology**. We intend to work
towards a successful **Review Conference** which would promote
**effective implementation, increase transparency, enhance compliance**
and confidence-building measures. Near-term concrete action should
include the establishment of a new expert working group to examine
concrete measures to strengthen the Convention.]{.underline}

28\. We pledge our continued support to the United Nations
Secretary-General's Mechanism to investigate alleged uses of chemical,
biological or toxin weapons. We will firmly resist and condemn any
attempts by any state or individual seeking to undermine its integrity,
independence, and impartial character and mandate. As the only
established international mechanism mandated to investigate alleged uses
of biological weapons, [we pledge to cooperate with partners to ensure
that the mechanism is properly resourced, equipped, and operationalized
to conduct effective investigations when needed。]{.underline}

[Biological weapons]{.underline} disseminate disease-causing organisms
or toxins to harm or kill humans, animals or plants. They [can be deadly
and highly contagious. Diseases caused by such weapons would not confine
themselves to national borders and could spread rapidly around the
world]{.underline}. The consequences of the deliberate release of
biological agents or toxins by state or non-state actors could be
dramatic. [In addition to the tragic loss of lives, such events could
cause food shortages, environmental catastrophes, devastating economic
loss, and widespread illness, fear and mistrust among the
public]{.underline}. The Biological Weapons Convention **[The Biological
Weapons Convention (BWC) effectively prohibits the development,
production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and
toxin weapons. It was the first multilateral disarmament treaty banning
an entire category of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The BWC is a
key element in the international community's efforts to address WMD
proliferation and it has established a strong norm against biological
weapons. The Convention has reached almost universal membership with 183
States Parties and four Signatory States. Biological Weapons Convention
Text of the Convention]{.underline}** The BWC itself is comparatively
short, comprising only 15 articles. [Over the years, it has been
supplemented by a series of additional understandings reached subsequent
Review Conference]{.underline}s. [The BWC Implementation Support Unit
regularly updates a document that provides information on additional
agreements which (a) interpret, define or elaborate the meaning or scope
of a provision of the Convention; or (b) provide instructions,
guidelines, or recommendations on how a provision should be
implemented]{.underline}. The text of the Convention is available for
download in the six official UN languages: English, Español, Français,
Pусский, 中文, عربي [Formally known as "The Convention on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of
Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on their
Destruction",]{.underline} the Convention was negotiated by the
Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, Switzerland. It
opened for signature on 10 April 1972 and entered into force on 26 March
1975. The BWC supplements the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which had prohibited
only the use of biological weapons. [States Parties to the Biological
Weapons Convention undertook "never in any circumstances to develop,
produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain: microbial or other
biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or method of
production, of types and in quantities that have no justification for
prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes; weapons, equipment
or means of delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile
purposes or in armed conflict."]{.underline} **[BWC States Parties have
strived to ensure that the Convention remains relevant and effective,
despite the changes in science and technology, politics and security
since it entered into force.]{.underline}** Throughout the intervening
years, States Parties have met approximately every five years to review
the operation of the BWC. Between these Review Conferences, States
Parties have pursued various activities and initiatives to strengthen
the effectiveness and improve the implementation of the Convention. A
total of eight Review Conferences have taken place since the first one
in 1980.

#### BWC is the most effective cornerstone for biodefense

R. Alexander **Hamilton et al \'21**, with Ruth Mampuys, S. E. Galaitsi,

\"Opportunities, Challenges, and Future Considerations for Top-Down
Governance for Biosecurity and Synthetic Biology,\" EMERGING THREATS OF
SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY, pg. 37--58

[The]{.underline} **[BWC]{.underline}**, [the premier international
forum that addresses biological threats, should play a **leading role**
in monitoring security-relevant advances in synthetic
biology.]{.underline} Proposals to establish a BWC scientific advisory
body and to introduce a S&T reporting requirement into the CBM mechanism
should be encouraged.

In view of the growing convergence between biology, chemistry,
engineering and computing, inter-convention [dialogue is needed between
the BWC and CWC, among others, to ensure the full scope of synthetic
biology's risks are taken into consideration and that there is agreement
on how to address these risks in the event of deliberate misuse by state
or non-state actors]{.underline}.

Given that many security concerns about synthetic biology relate to its
informational (e.g. digital sequence information) rather than physical
(e.g. DNA sequencers) dimensions, [it is necessary to develop improved
methods of regulating intangible technology transfers. It is no longer
sufficient to rely exclusively on material controls and list-based
approaches to regulation]{.underline}.

Synthetic biology is contributing to the democratization of genetic
engineering. It is therefore essential to enlist the support of
non-governmental organizations and actors, including technology
developers, industry and users, in the regulatory response. [The value
of complementing top-down governance measures with bottom-up governance
measures, drawing on limited forms of self-regulation or self-policing,
will only increase as the tools of modern biology become more
accessible]{.underline}.

[There is no one-size-fits-all approach to synthetic biology's
governance]{.underline}. [Finding the appropriate 'mix' of top-down and
bottom-up regulatory measures will require foresight, broad dialogue,
and a willingness on the part of governments to look to new, hybrid
forms of risk regulation]{.underline}.

#### U.S. Hegemony was the root cause of the Russia war

\"[[Let the gull\'d fool the toils of war pursue]{.mark}, [where bleed
the many to enrich the few]{.mark}]{.underline},\" wrote the
18th-century English poet William Shenstone. [That is what [is exactly
happening during the Russia-Ukraine conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Whether it\'s [the people of war-torn Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline},
sanction-ridden Russia, or insecurity-ingrained Europe, [all [have
suffered greatly]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The US]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[the culprit of]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark} crisis]{.underline},
**[[has been constantly taking advantage of others\' misfortune to
maintain its hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Every why has a wherefore.
Edward Carr, a leading British scholar of international relations,
reminded people more than 80 years ago that **[[the US was a master in
using kindness to disguise selfishness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Boasting
abundant resources, strong industry and geographical advantage, Ukraine
could have achieved development. While the country pursued a relatively
balanced policy in the early years of its independence, the US supported
and incited the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the Square Revolution in
2014 **[[to push for a pro-Western agenda, splitting Ukraine politically
from within and geopolitically between Russia and
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is really thought-provoking that the
\"Gateway to Europe\" has become one of the poorest countries in Europe,
the frontline of NATO\'s eastward expansion, and the fault line of
\"color revolutions\" and conflicts. In 2014 when the crisis broke out
in eastern Ukraine, while Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine held
several rounds of consultations and signed two Minsk Agreements to cool
down the situation, [[the US]{.mark} took an opposite direction to [fan
the flame]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by inciting the
anti-Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and pro-Western
forces]{.underline}]{.mark} [in Ukraine [to escalate the
conflicts]{.mark} on the ground]{.underline}. [In the current
Russia-Ukraine conflict,]{.underline} [[t**he US is reaping the benefits
without getting itself involved militarily**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[**[It]{.underline}** **[never intended to come to Ukraine\'s
rescue]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[[the idea used as a political
tool]{.mark} [by the US to trap Russia]{.mark} [in a seemingly endless
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We might need to go a bit further back
into history to conclude how the [[US hegemony had created all the
security trouble for Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}, [Russia and
Ukraine]{.underline}. It is well known that the US became a global
superpower after the two world wars which plunged Europe into chaos and
destruction and led to its dependence on the US military hegemony and
NATO. [Looking for a pathway to common security]{.underline}, [Europe
and the US signed the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union in
1975]{.underline}, [which saw the establishment of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation as well as the indivisible, cooperative and
comprehensive approach to security]{.underline}. However, after the Cold
War, [[the US]{.mark} [overturned the European]{.mark} security
[agenda]{.mark} **[and rejected Russia\'s bid to join NATO four
times]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[The aim was [to make Russia the
imaginary foe to justify US hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Since 1999,
[[the US launched five major NATO expansions]{.underline}]{.mark},
[pushing its borders eastward by more than 1,000 kilometers to include a
large number of Eastern European countries, **[splitting Europe
further]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It also promised Ukraine, Georgia and
other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) NATO
membership, **[[posing a realistic threat at the doorstep of]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Due to [[the hegemonic mentality and
actions by the US]{.underline},]{.mark} [the vision of indivisible
common security]{.underline} [broke into pieces]{.underline}, [and
Russia]{.underline}, [[Ukraine]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Europe
were left in a security dilemma]{.underline} [and constant
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}. Former US congressman Tulsi Gabbard
stated in a recent interview that President Joe **[[Biden could have
ended the crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}** by promising not to admit
Ukraine to NATO. But [[he didn\'t,]{.mark} [because]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[the US is seeking an excuse to impose sanctions on
Russia]{.underline}**, **[and it could profit from war for the American
military-industrial complex]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[[Ukraine has
become another victim in a series of global security crises instigated
by the US]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [just like Iraq]{.underline},
[Afghanistan]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [Syria]{.underline}. [Now
the hegemonic power is pushing for an Asian version of NATO expansion
via its Indo-Pacific Strateg]{.underline}y, [aiming to contain
China]{.underline}. **[[Hegemony is the source of evil and
chaos]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[while the common security is the only
correct option to avoid and end crises]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Whether
it is Europe or Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the rationales of security
are the same]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[Security cannot be enjoyed
exclusivel]{.underline}y]{.mark}, [[but only
shared]{.mark};]{.underline} [It is not a zero-sum game]{.underline},
[but win-win cooperation]{.underline}. History may prove again that, the
one who makes a fool of others will eventually make a fool of himself.

**[It is [a truth]{.mark}]{.underline} [[universally
acknowledged]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that the]{.mark}
notorious]{.underline} [[U.S. military-industrial
complex]{.underline}]{.mark} [in possession of good weapons]{.underline}
[[must be in want of a war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That is also the case
for the Ukraine crisis. [As the only country stretching nearly across
Eurasia]{.underline}, [[former Soviet Union]{.mark} [had been the
biggest threat to the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} [during the Cold
War]{.underline}. [Through]{.underline} U.S. President Ronald
[Reagan\'s]{.underline} \"[Star Wars program]{.underline}\" [and support
for his]{.underline} counterpart of the Soviet Union Mikhail
Gorbachev\'s [reforms]{.underline}, [[the U.S]{.mark}. finally exhausted
the socialistic great power]{.underline} [and [built up its hegemony in
Eurasia]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[30 years after the end]{.underline} [of
the Cold War]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**[the U.S. sees
Ukraine]{.underline} [as another chance to economically destroy and
politically destabilize Russia to maintain its primacy in
Eurasi]{.underline}**[a]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Through this geopolitical
crisis]{.underline} --- [one of the worst]{.underline} in the 21st
century --- [the U.S. intends to kill three birds with one
stone]{.underline}: [destabilize Ukraine]{.underline}, [control
Europe]{.underline} [and contain Russia]{.underline}. [That is an
obvious conclusion]{.underline} [considering the strategic importance of
Eurasia to the U.S]{.underline}., [which has long been a major player of
the geopolitical chessboard]{.underline} [since the Cold
War]{.underline}. As Tiberio Graziani, chair of Vision & Global Trends,
a Rome-based think tank, pointed out, **[[Washington\'s strategy is a
parody of the Roman]{.underline}]{.mark}** \"divide et impera,\" or
\"**[[divide]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [rule]{.mark}]{.underline}**\". [[The
U.S. just wants to play]{.mark}]{.underline} off [[the pawns against
each other]{.underline}]{.mark} in the game. Since the outbreak of the
Ukraine crisis, [[the **U.S. has been focusing on three
things**]{.underline}]{.mark}: **[[sanctioning]{.underline}]{.mark}**
almost **[[everything related to Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** including
its cats, **[[condemning Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[[providing
weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Uncle
Sam]{.underline}]{.mark} [[has done everything to fan the
flames]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but little to put out the
fire]{.underline}]{.mark}**. French President Emmanuel Macron commented
that although [he still believed in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization\'s brain death]{.underline}, [Russia\'s military operation
in Ukraine has become an electric shock for the
organization]{.underline}. \"It has given strategic importance to NATO
and made it even more necessary,\" he added. That is exactly what [the
U.S. has been keen to realize through the Ukraine crisi]{.underline}s:
[a revitalized NATO]{.underline} [and a Europe dependent]{.underline}
[on U.S. military protection]{.underline} [and security
guarantee]{.underline}. Beyond geopolitical gains, [there]{.underline}
[are other benefits for the U.S. to reap]{.underline}. Alexander
Clackson, founder of Global Political Insight, a UK-based think tank,
believes that [commercial interests are the reason pushing the U.S. to
provoke Russia to take actions]{.underline}. [As Russian oil and gas
industry became sanctioned]{.underline} by [the U.S]{.underline}., the
latter itself, which is also one of the world\'s top oil producers,
[becomes an alternative energy supplier]{.underline}. The Wall Street
Journal stated that [U.S. suppliers of]{.underline} liquefied natural
gas ([LNG]{.underline}) such as Cheniere Energy Inc. and Cameron LNG
[are already supplying record amounts]{.underline} of the fuel [to
starved European markets]{.underline}, of course [at a price much higher
than that of Russia\'s]{.underline} natural gas. Since the conflict
broke out, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, [manufacturers of U.S. supplied
missiles to Ukraine]{.underline}, have seen their [share]{.underline}
prices rise. According to Asia Times, Gregory J. Hayes, chief executive
of Raytheon said on January 25 that \"the tensions in eastern Europe are
putting pressure on some of the defense spending over there. So I fully
expect we\'re going to see some benefits from it.\" His expectation
might indicate more. [Making money from the crisis are not just those
weapons]{.underline} companies. An analysis by Business Insider shows
that at least 19 federal lawmakers or their spouses hold stock in
Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. **[[Billions of dollars in U.S. defense
aid to Ukraine meant that they can directly benefit from the dangerous
situation in Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Republican Rep. Marjorie
Taylor Greene of Georgia, who bought between \$1,001 and \$15,000 in
Lockheed Martin shares on February 22, wrote in a Twitter thread after
her purchase: \"[**[War is big busines]{.mark}s to our
leaders**.]{.underline}\" **[The conflict is still going on in Ukraine.
[It is]{.mark}]{.underline}** really **[[tragic]{.underline} [that the
biggest power of the world]{.underline}]{.mark} [[does little to promote
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}** [talks **[and
stability]{.underline}**]{.mark}**, [[but constantly makes
troubles]{.underline} [to seek its own]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[fortune]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That is **[[definitely the wrong side
of history]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[2017]{.mark} and caused [6 million casualtie]{.mark}s]{.underline}.
[From the end of World War II]{.underline} in 1945 to 2001, among the
248 armed conflicts that occurred in 153 regions of the world, 201 were
initiated by the US. A report from Brown University revealed that the
wars launched by the US in the two decades following the 9/11 terrorist
attack killed more than 900,000 people. In June 2018, **[[the US pulled

Speaking of the Ukraine crisis, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
claimed at a Michigan University event that \"[[this]{.mark} [is not
about siding with the United States]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It\'s about
siding with right versus wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}; [it\'s about siding

right side of history]{.underline}. **[[Whoever disagrees with the U.S.

not really in a position to claim moral leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[One [of the biggest question marks is American hypocrisy and double
standards]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[How can a country]{.mark} [preach
about peace and order when it was]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as Jimmy
Carter puts it, **["[at peace for only 16 of its 242 years as a

387,000]{.underline}**
[\[**[Three-Hundred-Eighty-Seven-Thousand]{.mark}**\] **[civilians in
the past 21 years since 9/11]{.mark}**]{.underline}? According to the
Carnegie Endowment, [[Middle-Eastern citizens are]{.underline}]{.mark}
\"[[torn between sympathizing with Ukrainians]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[...\] [[and remembering how the world looked away as the same weapons
were wreaking havoc in Syria and Libya only a few years]{.mark}
[ago]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" [[The U.S. is far from being a constructive
force for peace in the Ukraine crisis]{.underline}.]{.mark} Turkey has
provided a venue for a face-to-face talk between the conflicting
parties. Israel has emerged as a mediator. And EU states including
France, Germany, Austria and Hungary have sought direct dialogues with
Russian President Vladimir Putin. Nevertheless,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[U.S.]{.mark} [has appeared to be the most
reluctant to see the bloodshed end]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Instead of
promoting peace talks]{.underline}, [[the Biden administration has
chosen to transfer lethal weapons]{.underline}, [deliberately escalating
tensions in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. What exactly are the
principles of the international system that Blinken declares to defend?
Very intuitively, most countries would stand for mutual respect,
equality and shared benefits. But [those are definitely not what the
U.S]{.underline}., [who has been vigorously forcing others to take
sides]{.underline}, would choose to believe. To the disappointment of
the U.S.,most countries are vigilant and even resentful to the \"us
versus them\" [mentality imposed by the U.S..]{.underline} They want and
have the right to make independent choices in their own interest,
instead of being dragged into the big power rivalry. After all, one
can\'t provide for its population by taking side. Time for a reality
check. [Out of the 233 countries in the world]{.underline}, [only 48
joined in the sanctions against Russia]{.underline}. If considered from
a population perspective, that ratio is 1.1 billion versus 6.5 billion,
of which 4.8 billion are firmly against such sanctions. That means the
vast majority of the world\'s population do not support America\'s
sanction schemes. At the UN, 35 member states that account for almost
half the world\'s population abstained from condemning Russia. And 82
countries opposed to or abstained from hastily suspending Russia from
the Human Rights Council. **[[The U.S. bullying and unilateral sanctions
have pushed developing nations to reconsider geopolitics and
international justice in their own right]{.underline}]{.mark}**. None of
the BRICS or Shanghai Cooperation Organization members supported
sanctions, nor did the Arab world. India abstained in votes both at the
UN Security Council and its General Assembly. South African president
Cyril Ramaphosa said that \"the war could have been avoided if NATO had
heeded the warnings \[...\] that its eastward expansion would lead to
greater, not less, instability in the region.\"Israel, arguably
America\'s closest friend, is keeping an open mind as Prime Minister
