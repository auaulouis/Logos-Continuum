### Antitrust Reform Good -- 1NC

#### A. Uniqueness -- Antitrust reform will pass now -- but it's running out of time

**Reardon, CNET senior reporter, 7-1-22**

\[Marguerite, 7-1-22, CNET, "Congress\' Bid to Rein In Big Tech Needs a
Push Over the Finish Line",
<https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/congress-bid-to-rein-in-big-tech-needs-a-push-over-the-finish-line/>,
accessed 7-4-22, AFB\]

What\'s happening

**[Congress is on the verge of passing major bipartisan antitrust and
privacy legislation to rein in the power of tech giants. But it\'s
running out of time.]{.underline}**

Why it matters

**[The antitrust and privacy laws, which have gotten support from right,
left and center politicians, would change how big tech companies do
business. But the coalition could fall apart if votes don\'t happen
before the summer recess in a midterm election year.]{.underline}**

#### B. Link -- 

[\[INSERT\]]{.mark}

#### C. Political capital key to antitrust reform

**Bordelon, Politico, 22**

\[Brendan, 2-4-22, Politico, "Under pressure, Biden backs antitrust
push",
https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2022/02/04/under-pressure-biden-backs-antitrust-push-00005579,
accessed 7-2-22, AFB\]

**[The Biden team came out in favor of the antitrust measures moving
through both houses of Congress]{.underline}** late Thursday --- **[but
how much]{.underline}** public support and **[political capital the
White House aims to spend on reining in giant tech companies remains an
open question.]{.underline}**

**[The move, coming hours after the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced
a bill]{.underline}** to break Apple and Google's hold on app stores,
**[marks the first time the White House has officially weighed in on the
congressional antitrust push]{.underline}**, Leah and POLITICO's Adam
Cancryn reported. **[While the White House held a "listening session"
with supporters of tech antitrust reform]{.underline}** two weeks ago,
**[it offered a neutral readout afterward, saying only that officials
"look forward to working with Congress to make bipartisan progress on
the issue."]{.underline}**

**[But that polite restraint ended]{.underline}** this week **[following
the administration's foray into the European Union's draft Digital
Markets Act]{.underline}** --- a package of rules designed to rein in
the power of tech giants. As Leah and POLITICO EU's Samuel Stolton and
Mark Scott reported, D.C. antitrust advocates weren't pleased with the
policy paper, thinking it could undermine pending congressional
legislation targeting the digital giants. The Transatlantic Consumer
Dialogue --- a group of 75 U.S. and EU consumer groups --- called out
the Biden administration Thursday for expressing "concern" about the
administration's statements on the DMA.

"The DMA does not target U.S. companies but rather targets companies
that are in a position to define how goods, services, and information
reach customers and which too often turn this position to their
advantage to the detriment of competition and consumers' interests," the
groups said, urging Biden to "work constructively with the EU" on
finalizing the legislation.

**[Biden was always going to have to make a decision on whether to
publicly back the antitrust bills]{.underline}** --- particularly with
congressional Democrats split.

#### D. Impact -- Economic Recovery

#### 1. Antitrust reform key to restoring competition

**Connor & Simpson, Center for American Progress Technology Policy vice
president and director, 22**

\[Adam & Erin, Center for American Progression, "Evaluating 2 Tech
Antitrust Bills to Restore Competition Online,
<https://americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/OnlineCompetition-report.pdf>,
p. 6, accessed 7-1-22, AFB\]

If enacted, **[the American Innovation and Choice Online Act and the
Open App Markets Act will mark a major step forward in restoring
competitive markets. The bills would help unlock the potential of
Americans to grow successful businesses and build an economy that is
more prosperous, equitable, and innovative. They would likewise remove
barriers to functional consumer services and introduce competitive
incentives for improved quality, innovation, and competitive prices for
American consumers.]{.underline}**

#### 2. Growth key to global stability -- solves existential threats and key to coop

**Baird, Markle Foundation CEO & President, 20**

\[Zoë, "Equitable Economic Recovery Is a National Security Imperative".
<https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chapter-13_Baird_Equitable-Economic-Recovery.pdf>,
p. 89-90, accessed 7-1-22, AFB\]

**[Broadly shared economic prosperity is a bedrock of America's economic
and political strength]{.underline}**---both domestically and in the
international arena. **[A strong and equitable]{.underline}**
**[recovery from the economic crisis created by COVID-19 would be a
powerful testament to the resilience of the American system and its
ability to create prosperity at a time of seismic change and persistent
global crisis. Such a recovery could attack the profound economic
inequities that have developed over the past several
decades]{.underline}**. **[Without bold action]{.underline}** to help
all workers access good jobs as the economy returns, **[the United
States risks undermining the legitimacy of its institutions and its
international standing. The outcome will be a key determinant of
America's national security]{.underline}** for years to come.

**[An equitable]{.underline}** **[recovery requires a national
commitment to]{.underline}** help all workers obtain good
**[jobs]{.underline}**---particularly the two-thirds of adults without a
bachelor's degree and people of color who have been most affected by the
crisis and were denied opportunity before it. As the nation engages in a
historic debate about how to accelerate economic recovery, **[ambitious
public investment is necessary to put Americans back to work with
dignity and opportunity]{.underline}**. We need an intentional effort to
make sure that the jobs that come back are good jobs with decent wages,
benefits, and mobility and to empower workers to access these
opportunities in a profoundly changed labor market.

To achieve these goals, **[American policy makers need to establish job
growth strategies]{.underline}** that address urgent public needs
through major programs in green energy, infrastructure, and health.
Alongside these job growth strategies, we need to recognize and develop
the talents of workers by creating an adult learning system that meets
workers' needs and develops skills for the digital economy. **[The
national security community must lend its support to this
cause]{.underline}**. And as it does so, it can bring home the lessons
from the advances made in these areas in other countries, particularly
our European allies, and consider this a realm of international
cooperation and international engagement.

**[Shared Economic Prosperity Is a National Security
Asset]{.underline}**

**[A strong economy is essential to America's security and diplomatic
strategy. Economic strength increases our influence on the global stage,
expands markets, and funds a strong and agile military]{.underline}**
and national defense. Yet it is not enough for America's economy to be
strong for some---prosperity must be broadly shared. Widespread belief
in the ability of the American economic system to create **[economic
security and mobility for all---the American Dream--- creates
credibility and legitimacy for America's values, governance, and
alliances around the world.]{.underline}**

After World War II, **[the United States grew the middle class to
historic size and strength. This achievement made America the model of
the free world---setting the stage for decades of American political and
economic leadership.]{.underline}**

**[Domestically, broad participation in the economy is core to the
legitimacy of our democracy and the strength of our political
institutions.]{.underline}** A belief that the economic system works for
millions is an important part of creating trust in a democratic
government's ability to meet the needs of the people.

The COVID-19 Crisis Puts Millions of American Workers at Risk

For the last several decades, the American Dream has been on the wane.
Opportunity has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small
share of workers able to access the knowledge economy. Too many
Americans, particularly those without four-year degrees, experienced
stagnant wages, less stability, and fewer opportunities for advancement.

Since COVID-19 hit, millions have lost their jobs or income and are
struggling to meet their basic needs---including food, housing, and
medical care.1 The crisis has impacted sectors like hospitality,
leisure, and retail, which employ a large share of America's most
economically vulnerable workers, resulting in alarming disparities in
unemployment rates along education and racial lines. In August, the
unemployment rate for those with a high school degree or less was more
than double the rate for those with a bachelor's degree.2 Black and
Hispanic Americans are experiencing disproportionately high
unemployment, with the gulf widening as the crisis continues.3

The experience of the Great Recession shows that without intentional
effort to drive an inclusive recovery, inequality may get worse: while
workers with a high school education or less experienced the majority of
job losses, nearly all new jobs went to workers with postsecondary
education. Inequalities across racial lines also increased as workers of
color worked in the hardest-hit sectors and were slower to recover
earnings and income than White workers.4

The Case for an Inclusive Recovery

A recovery that promotes broad economic participation, renewed
opportunity, and equity will strengthen American moral and political
authority around the world. It will send a strong message about the
strength and resilience of democratic government and the American
people's ability to adapt to a changing global economic landscape.

**[An inclusive recovery will reaffirm American leadership as core to
the success of our most critical international alliances]{.underline}**,
which are rooted in the notion of shared destiny and interdependence**[.
For example, NATO, which has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy
and a force of global stability for decades, has suffered from American
disengagement in recent years. A strong American recovery---coupled with
a renewed openness to international collaboration---is core to NATO's
ability to solve shared geopolitical and security challenges. A renewed
partnership with our European allies from a position of economic
strength will enable us to address global crises such as climate change,
global pandemics, and refugees. Together, the United States and Europe
can pursue a commitment to investing in workers for shared economic
competitiveness, innovation, and long-term prosperity.]{.underline}**

## Uniqueness

### Uniqueness -- Antitrust Reform Will Pass Now

#### Antitrust reform will pass now -- but focus now is key

**Brody, Protocol senior reporter & Chitkara, Protocol reporter,
7-1-22**

\[Ben & Hirsh, 7-1-22, Protocol, "During recess, tech antitrust is on
\'a knife edge\',
<https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/policy/aicoa-antitrust-lobbying-recess?rebelltitem=10#rebelltitem10>,
accessed 7-4-22, AFB\]

Should I stay or should AICOA?

**[Senators recently headed home for a two-week break without taking
action on the tech antitrust bill. That doesn't mean, though, the moment
is any less crucial for the fate of the American Innovation and Choice
Online Act.]{.underline}** And **[even if supporters and detractors
alike think they'll win by just staying their courses, they know they
have to make the best of the time that lawmakers will spend at July
Fourth barbecues.]{.underline}**

**[Those who support AICOA, and claim they have the votes to pass it,
were eager to get a vote before the Independence Day
recess.]{.underline}** But that doomed hope wasn't just a scheduling
preference, like slipping out for lunch at 11:30 a.m. on a summer
Friday.

Rather, this recess (or the "state work period," as it's called by
lawmakers who are sensitive about the notion they're on the job only
half the time) offers Big Tech more time to plead its case, strategize,
advertise against the measure, grab attention with stunts, come up with
procedural hurdles, etc.

Tech and its friends might be able to mobilize real-life constituents
--- who are theoretically the people senators most care about --- to
give a piece of their mind to the lawmakers at cookouts and fireworks
shows.

It's worth watching out for that dynamic: **[Yes, it gets really hard to
do much in Congress after August because of the demands of campaigning,
but senators who are facing tough races may start to waver if they're
hearing a lot about voter concerns right now.]{.underline}**

Some of that in-person jawboning is surely going on, and is organized by
both sides, said Adam Kovacevich, a former Google official who now runs
a pro-tech group that's been highly critical of AICOA.

But, Kovacevich contends, what senators may hear about most are more
basic economic concerns or else hotter-button political topics ---
particularly in the wake of a busy SCOTUS season.

"When a senator is marching in a July Fourth parade, what are the top
issues that voters and constituents come up to them and ask them to deal
with?" he said. "It's much more likely to be inflation, abortion, guns,
not Amazon Basics."

So, no, Big Tech hasn't yet launched some sort of massive protest
movement to get everyday users to accost senators.

Companies are still trying to reach senators at the moment, though.
Business organizations are sending letters. Think tanks and
business-allied groups are writing blog posts. The Big Tech CEOs were
even reaching out last week.

These are more or less the things tech was doing before, but it's
important to realize they're not exactly minimal. Rather, these efforts
are backed by literal millions of dollars in ad spending and hot
rhetoric about national security and inflation.

Kovacevich also teased that tech allies are "looking at" new ads focused
on the content moderation concerns that have threatened to alienate
progressives.

Plus, all this keepin' on, backed up by hefty ad spending, does make
good strategic sense if tech really does think it's already winning.

"Going into July and then into the August recess, our focus is just
maintaining where we're at --- still persuading senators that this isn't
the time to do this bill, that there's issues with this bill," said
Robert Winterton, a spokesperson for the tech trade group NetChoice. "We
feel like where we're at is working."

On the other hand, **[even top-level pleas to Senate Majority Leader
Chuck Schumer have only resulted in the CEOs being told personally that
he supports the legislation and is working "to get the necessary votes
to pass it," according to the Washington Post.]{.underline}**

**[Meanwhile, pro-AICOA forces are trying to harness their own
grassroots]{.underline}** and get attention they don't have to pay quite
so much for.

Digital rights group Fight for the Future, for instance, put up video
billboards outside Schumer's D.C. and New York homes that play the John
Oliver segment boosting the antitrust bill.

An "independent developer" who just happens also to be named Adam
Kovacevich even wrote in Newsweek about his support for the bills.

**[What this means was actually summed up by]{.underline}** a Brit I
recently spoke with --- Richard **[Stables, CEO of the Kelkoo
Group]{.underline}**, a European shopping comparison site that's pushed
tech competition matters on both sides of the Atlantic. **[After
attending "seven or eight" meetings with Capitol staff and lawmakers
last week, he told me he was "cautiously optimistic" that AICOA has the
votes, though some supporters aren't ready to admit it. But, he added:
"I think it's on a bit of a knife edge."]{.underline}**

#### Antitrust reform will pass now -- each day of delay makes the impact more likely

**Zakrzewski et al., Washington Post Technology Policy reporter,
6-27-22**

\[Cat Zakrzewski, Will Oremus, Washington Post Technology news analysis
writer, Gerrit De Vynck, Washington Post Tech reporter covering Google,

anchoring The Technology 202, focusing on politics and policy, 6-27-22,
Washington Post, "With clock ticking, battle over tech regulation
intensifies",
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/27/antitrust-tech-battle-congress/>,
accessed 7-2-22, AFB\]

**[The clock is ticking. The legislation has support from the left,
right and center, a rare alliance that will likely dissolve after the
midterm elections, said]{.underline}** William E. **[Kovacic, former
Republican chair of the Federal Trade Commission and a professor at
George Washington University Law School who studies antitrust and
competition.]{.underline}**

**["Simply put, this may be the best chance the advocates of new
legislation ever get to realize their aims for reform," Kovacic
said.]{.underline}**

**[For more than three years, through a pandemic, two impeachments and
an insurrection, lawmakers and their staffs have systematically
collected evidence that Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook engaged in
anticompetitive tactics to solidify their dominance across the internet.
They've hosted high-profile hearings with the companies' CEOs, and
pushed bills through House and Senate committees with bipartisan
votes.]{.underline}** And they heard from the CEOs of smaller tech
firms, including Sonos, Spotify and Tile, who testified that the giants
had leveraged the power of their platforms to give their own apps and
products unfair advantages over independent rivals.

**[The congressional probe found that the four companies control
essential portals to the digital economy --- and increasingly use those
platforms to offer their own products and features, competing with the
same businesses that rely on them. Critics say that's a glaring conflict
of interest;]{.underline}** the tech giants say it's for their
customers' own good.

**[Breaking up the companies isn't on the table in the current antitrust
package, which focuses on regulating tech companies' treatment of
rivals. Still, the bills mark the closest Washington has yet come to
comprehensive regulation of a U.S. tech industry that includes four of
the world's five most valuable publicly traded companies.]{.underline}**

**[The key bills --- the American Innovation and Choice Online Act and
the Open App Markets Act --- have been languishing in Congress for
months, and their chances of becoming law grow dimmer the closer
Congress gets to the midterms, when lawmakers' attention will turn to
campaigning.]{.underline}** **[Democrats risk losing control of Congress
in that election, and significant tech antitrust bills are viewed as
unlikely to pass under Republican leadership.]{.underline}**

In an interview Friday, **[Cicilline said it's "very important" that the
legislation comes to a floor vote before Congress leaves for its August
recess.]{.underline}**

**["Every day we wait, we are doing significant harm to the ability of
small businesses to survive," Cicilline said.]{.underline}**

The legislation's supporters are up against a host of competing
political priorities, as Democrats and the Biden administration scramble
to address gun control, inflation, climate policy and the Supreme
Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade.

**[Cicilline says that lawmakers have the votes to pass the legislation,
and the tech executives' recent visits to Washington reflect how worried
they are]{.underline}**. Pichai also met with Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.), who had previously raised concerns that the bills would
single out companies in her home state. He also met with Republican
lawmakers including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.),
Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) and Sen. Steve Daines
(R-Mont.), said multiple people familiar with the matter who spoke on
the condition of anonymity to discuss private meetings. Representatives
for McConnell, Daines and Thune did not respond to a request for
comment.

#### Antitrust reform will pass now -- but the window is narrow and closing

**Feiner, CNBC, 6-4-22**

\[Lauren, 6/4/22, CNBC, "Lawmakers are racing to pass tech antitrust
reforms before midterms."
<https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/04/lawmakers-racing-to-pass-tech-antitrust-tech-reforms-before-midterms.html>,
accessed 7-4-22, AFB\]

**[A major piece of legislation that could reshape the tech industry is
just a few steps away from becoming federal law.]{.underline}** **[But
advocates fear that if congressional leadership doesn't usher it through
before the midterms, or at least the end of the year, it could
die.]{.underline}**

**[The American Innovation and Choice Online Act,]{.underline}** a
Senate bill that closely resembles an earlier House version, **[advanced
out of the Judiciary Committee earlier this year by a wide
margin.]{.underline}**

Known among staff and lawmakers as the self-preferencing or
anti-discrimination bill, **[the legislation would prohibit dominant
tech platforms]{.underline}** like Amazon, Apple and Google **[from
giving preferential treatment to their own services]{.underline}** in
marketplaces they operate. If passed, it could prevent Google from
having its own travel recommendations at the top of search results, for
example. Or Amazon might have to ensure its own products are ranked by
the same criteria as competitors' products.

**[The bill has overcome intense lobbying from the tech industry, and
there are increasingly signs it will move forward before the August
recess.]{.underline}**

**[Advocates feel there's little time to spare]{.underline}**. **[They
cite the probability that]{.underline}** **[with Republican control of
the House following]{.underline}** the **[November]{.underline}** vote,
the party would follow current caucus leaders who have signaled that
**[antitrust reform would be a lower priority]{.underline}**. In the
digital space, Republican House leaders have been focused more on
content moderation and privacy issues.

**[Given that backdrop, onlookers are wondering: What will it
take]{.underline}** for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., or
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., **[to give the bills time on the
floor for a vote?]{.underline}**

**[They're getting closer, sources tell CNBC.]{.underline}** Schumer met
about the status of antitrust legislation on May 18 with Sens. Dick
Durbin, D-Ill., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., chairs of the Judiciary
Committee and subcommittee on antitrust, respectively, according to a
Democratic source familiar with the conversation. (The source, like
others who are not named in this article, spoke on the condition of
anonymity to discuss behind-the-scenes conversations in Congress.)

#### Antitrust reform will pass now, but bipartisanship is key

**Tusk, Tusk Venture Partners co-founder, 6-10-22**

\[Bradley, 6-10-22, Protocol, "Big Tech regulation is bipartisan.",
<https://www.protocol.com/policy/bipartisan-tech-regulation-tusk>,
accessed 6-22-22\]

We live in a society where each party instinctively opposes the views of
the other. If Democrats say they like ice cream, Republicans say that
ice cream has secret microchips that spy for the Chinese. If Republicans
say they like apple pie, Democrats say the dessert is a symbol of
oppression and must be banned. Sadly, it sometimes does reach levels
almost this silly. But **[there seems to be one issue defying political
gravity: tech regulation.]{.underline}**

From Congress to the Supreme Court, from states to presidential
candidates, from think tanks on the left to those on the right, **[the
stars have aligned far differently around regulating Big Tech than they
have for almost any other current issue]{.underline}**.

For example, the U.S. Supreme Court recently issued a stay of a Texas
law that was designed to ban online platforms from restricting user
posts based on political views. The social media companies argued that
the Texas law violated their First Amendment rights to control the
content on their platforms. So you have what's meant to be a
pro-Republican position on the Texas law --- preventing platforms like
Twitter from banning people like Trump --- against what's normally a
Democratic position, protecting the First Amendment.

But the outcome was surprising. The majority who voted to pause the
Texas law --- Chief Justice John Roberts (appointed by George W. Bush)
and Justices Stephen Breyer (appointed by Bill Clinton), Sonia Sotomayor
(appointed by Barack Obama), Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett (both
appointed by Donald Trump) --- make an unusual set of allies. And on the
other side, Justice Elena Kagan (Obama), one of the most liberal members
of the court, sided with Justices Samuel Alito (W. Bush), Neil Gorsuch
(Trump) and Clarence Thomas (George H.W. Bush) to oppose the stay ---
not the usual coalition.

But justices aren't beholden to voters, so maybe it's easier for them to
agree while everyone else still has to toe the party line. Disproving
that theory, though, only requires one glance at **[the American
Innovation and Choice Online Act in Congress]{.underline}**. The bill
**[prohibits dominant media platforms,]{.underline}** defined by their
market cap and number of users, **[from discriminating against other
businesses that rely on their services]{.underline}**. **[So for
example, Amazon wouldn't be able to make products from outside vendors
far less attractive or easy to find than their own
products.]{.underline}**

**[The legislation]{.underline}**, led by prominent Democratic Sen. Amy
Kloubchar, **[passed out of the Senate Judiciary
Committee]{.underline}** in January **[with a 16-6 vote, reflecting
broad bipartisan support.]{.underline}** Republican Sens. Chuck
Grassley, Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley and John Kennedy all
supported it, with Grassley and Kennedy both serving as co-sponsors.
**[Passing anything in Congress is still akin to a miracle, but if one
bill has a shot of passing this year, it may be this one.]{.underline}**

**[The bipartisan trend toward regulating Big Tech even occurred during
the 2020 presidential race]{.underline}**, one of the ugliest races in
history. Trump and Biden didn't agree on much, but they did agree on one
issue: revoking Section 230. Sec. 230 is a federal law that protects
platforms like Facebook or Twitter from being sued for content posted by
its users. In my view, it is the single biggest contributor to making
the internet toxic. And that issue is so much of concern to both sides
that Trump publicly called out "the horrendous tech giants," and argued
for repealing Sec. 230 at a rally in Georgia. Biden then said the same
thing: "Sec. 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked,
No. 1. For Zuckerberg and other platforms. It should be revoked because
it is not merely an internet company. It is propagating falsehoods they
know to be false."

Now, given Washington's ineptitude, Sec. 230 is of course still alive
and well. **[But in a world where most issues are automatically doomed
because one side's support immediately prevents the other's, there's at
least a chance something can get done.]{.underline}**

**[intends to put bipartisan tech antitrust legislation up for a vote by

Why it matters: **[Schumer is in charge of the Senate\'s

in the next Congress look shaky.

The legislation would then have to pass the House, where there is a
companion bill.

with]{.underline}** Sens. Amy **[Klobuchar]{.underline}** (D-Minn.)
**[and]{.underline}** Richard **[Durbin]{.underline}** (D-Ill.)
Wednesday **[to discuss]{.underline}** next steps for Klobuchar\'s
bipartisan bill, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which
passed out of the Senate Judiciary committee earlier this year.

The bill would ban Big Tech companies like Google, Apple, Amazon and
Meta from favoring their own services in an anticompetitive way, similar
to a House bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee as part of a
marathon markup last summer.

**[Schumer urged Klobuchar to release an edited version of her bill with
input from bipartisan members of the Judiciary Committee soon, so
members have time to review it before it\'s put up for a floor
vote]{.underline}**, per the source.

**[Schumer told Durbin and Klobuchar he fully supports the antitrust
bill, and committed to putting a revised bill on the Senate
floor]{.underline}**, according to the source.

**[Yet facing near-record low approval ratings five months before the

acknowledging the pain many families are feeling from higher prices of
gas, groceries, housing and more.

Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, labeling the sticker shock \"Putin\'s
price hike.\" And he has accused Republicans of resisting his efforts to

agenda.]{.underline}**

**[An official told CNN to expect to see this effort to focus on the
economy to continue for the rest of the month as officials want to

**[Since Biden returned from a last-minute diplomatic outing to Europe
last month, he\'s held no scheduled events about Russia\'s invasion \--
a stark contrast to the previous weeks, when the President emerged
regularly to update Americans on new sanctions, intelligence and Western
military assistance.]{.underline}**

Even as the atrocities of Bucha played out on television screens across
the world this week --- including in the West Wing, where an outraged
Biden and his team watched with horror --- there were no specific events
to address the grim footage.

**[Instead, Biden\'s focus has been squarely at home. From the cost of
health care to supply chain bottlenecks to prices at the pump and a
robust economic recovery]{.underline}** --- one that officials believe
simply hasn\'t broken through --- **[Biden\'s public focus has lately
been guided entirely by domestic issues.]{.underline}**

The shift comes as Biden and his team assess a concerning political
landscape complicated by the ripple effect of severe economic sanctions
imposed on Moscow. **[Other recent developments \-- including a decision
to lift pandemic-era restrictions on the border \-- have contributed to
growing unease among Democrats about November\'s
elections]{.underline}**. **[And a recent surge of Covid-19 cases among

**[Biden\'s response to Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine has done little to

unprecedented unity among Western allies. As the White House settles in
for what officials believe will be a prolonged conflict, there has been
a clear effort to try and break through wall-to-wall war coverage with
Biden\'s domestic priorities.

### Link -- NATO Cost/Prioritization

#### Supporting NATO will trigger debate over priorities

**Maitra, Center for the National Interest National Security
Fellow, 7-6-22**

(Sumantra, 7-6-22, The Federalist, \"Biden Doubles Down On Forcing
Americans To Fund Europe\'s
Security\", https://thefederalist.com/2022/07/06/biden-doubles-down-on-forcing-americans-to-fund-europes-security/, accessed

[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's secretary general confirmed
NATO is boosting its forces in Europe to "well over 300,000" from the
current 40,000, a [650 percent
increase](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2022/06/27/nato-pledges-300000-troops-in-biggest-defense-overhaul-since-cold-war-as-ukraine-war-enters-fourth-month/?sh=6d56ff5a3cb7).]{.underline}
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claims it's to respond to the
Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Setting aside the obvious ridiculousness of NATO boosting a deterrence
force, however, at the very same time Russia is failing to conquer even
Ukraine and is increasingly bogged down, such euphemisms from NATO are
jarring. **[Everyone understands this means [U.S. taxpayers will carry
an additional
burden](https://www.ft.com/content/bc3ace5b-95d0-4f76-af58-33554399005a) for
European security.]{.underline}**

Consider [[the
details]{.underline}](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/biden-seeks-united-front-nato-summit-deal-add-finland-sweden-rcna35718):
President Biden will deploy additional troops to Romaniand air defenses
to Germany and Italy, and increase the number of destroyers stationed in
Spain from four to six.

**[The new additions are so bizarrely out of proportion to the threat
that it provoked one of the most hawkish Republicans, Florida Sen. Marco
Rubio, to question why Biden is reinforcing Europe at the cost of the
Pacific: "Russia's military is in no condition to invade anyone else
right now and its China & North Korea who are threatening military
aggression," [Rubio
tweeted](https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1542215006686773252).]{.underline}**

**[In a time of inflation and with a rapid Chinese military build-up in
the Indo-Pacific, Biden is doubling down on providing security for
Europe when the United States should be
"burden-shifting,"]{.underline}** especially with relatively finite
naval assets and as rich European economic powerhouses like Germany
already free-ride on American taxpayers.

The [[question of Germany is
crucial]{.underline}](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-biden-gets-wrong-about-european-defense-203116) in
this regard. As former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Elbridge
Colby
recently [[tweeted]{.underline}](https://twitter.com/ElbridgeColby/status/1541803108354990086),
**["It's a commonplace in American discussion that German foreign policy
has been 'naive.' Well, Germany spends almost nothing on defense and has
peacefully become the economic hegemon of Europe. Meantime we've had
failed Middle East wars and enabled China's rise. Who's
naive?"]{.underline}**

Colby is, of course, correct. The idea that German foreign policy is
derived from pacifism and war guilt, not one of the cleverest instances
of strategic "[[buck
passing]{.underline}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_passing#In_international_relations),"
is perhaps the most debilitating assumption of Anglo-American grand
strategies. It's a misjudgment that [[German strategists are more than
happy to see
continue]{.underline}](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/07/the-gold-medal-for-foreign-policy-goes-to-germany/),
because they are smart.

**[Only nine countries reach the required defense spending within NATO,
even after four years of President Trump pushing and an invasion of
Ukraine.]{.underline}**

**[When the richest countries in the richest continent can make two
other external maritime great powers such as the United Kingdom and the
United States, neither part of the mainland, pay for their security, it
can be considered a major win---for the continent.]{.underline}**

A recent paper titled "[[Woke
Imperium]{.underline}](https://peacediplomacy.org/2022/06/27/woke-imperium-the-coming-confluence-between-social-justice-and-neoconservatism/)"
helps explain this development. In a normal world, a decimated Russian
invasion force bogged down in Ukraine would be an opportunity for
further retrenchment from Europe, letting the rich Europeans share their
own security burden, it observes. Instead, we see a doubling down on
rhetoric about the "liberal international order," promoted by the same
NGOcracy that led to wasting trillions in Afghanistan to allegedly
ensure girl's schools and democratic institutions, as the paper notes:

"The rise of a 'woke' activist-driven, social justice-oriented
politics---particularly among the members of academia, media, and the
professional managerial class---has provided the latest ideological
justification for interventionism, and it has become readily adopted by
the U.S. foreign policy establishment. **[These groups now have an even
greater level of symbiotic relationship with state actors," the paper
states, adding, "the emerging hegemonic posture and its moral
imperialism are at odds with a sober and realistic appraisal of U.S.
interests on the world stage, as they create untenable, maximalist, and
utopian goals that clash with the concrete realities on which U.S. grand
strategy must be based."]{.underline}**

The paper goes on to argue that the "liberal Atlanticist tendency" to
drive "moralism and social engineering" may well create a backlash
around the world, creating "new forms of anti-Westernism." **[Put
simply, U.S. foreign policy is now completely utopian, disregarding
geography and interests and betting trillions on amorphous aims such as
ensuring rights in Ukraine and further subsidizing Europe, all to
maintain some mythical liberal international order that was never very
orderly nor international to begin with.]{.underline}**

**[Whether and how long Americans are willing to accept this bipartisan
internationalist edifice, at the cost of declining living standards and
rising crime at home, remains to be seen]{.underline}**.

### Link -- NATO Coop -- GOP

#### Plan will trigger GOP backlash -- opposition to NATO growing

**Blake, Washington Post senior political reporter, 4-6-22**

\[Aaron, 4-6-22, Washington Post, "Why 30 percent of the House GOP voted
against reaffirming NATO support",
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/06/house-gop-nato-support/>,
accessed 7-3-22, AFB\]

**[A quarter-century ago, the U.S. Senate was faced with a major
question: whether to ratify expanding the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) to include Poland, the Czech Republic and
Hungary]{.underline}**, which would bring the alliance closer to
Russia's border. **[The public generally supported NATO expansion, as
did both President Bill Clinton and his 1996 GOP opponent, Bob Dole.
Still, one foreign policy expert at the time said the ratification would
require a "feat of magic": Support for NATO expansion was shallow, and
senators had hugely varied priorities.]{.underline}**

Complicating matters, a Republican-controlled Senate had never joined
with a Democratic president to expand NATO. Indeed, that partisan
dynamic resulted in the defeat of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.

**[In the end, though, Republicans provided the bulk of the votes to
make it happen. The ratification passed in "strikingly bipartisan"
fashion]{.underline}**, as The Washington Post recounted at the time. It
reached the required two-thirds threshold with plenty of votes to spare;
45 of the 80 "yes" votes came from Republicans.

**[Times have certainly changed.]{.underline}**

On Tuesday, **[63 House Republicans voted against a symbolic resolution
reaffirming support for NATO]{.underline}** and its principles, amid
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. **[The "no" votes comprised more than 30
percent of the party's conference]{.underline}**.

As with any such symbolic resolution, it's worth parsing exactly what it
contains. Oftentimes, these resolutions are crafted to force the other
party into a politically difficult vote by including smaller provisions
or loaded language they might object to, then accusing them of opposing
the overall (and often popular) thrust of the bill.

But even accounting for those details, **[this vote marks the latest
shift away from what was once a bipartisan, consensus view in
Congress]{.underline}** --- **[supporting NATO and its importance in
keeping Russia in check.]{.underline}** And **[the shift continues
apace.]{.underline}**

**[Few Republicans have commented on their reasons]{.underline}** for
opposing the resolution, **[but writer Will Saletan previewed the vote
Tuesday by noting a number of ways in which the party has drifted in a
more Russia-ambivalent and even NATO-skeptical direction]{.underline}**.
**[Among the emerging views he isolated: that NATO was at fault for
provoking Vladimir Putin, that we should focus instead on our own
Southern border, and that the United States has no business defending
European allies, whether in NATO or otherwise.]{.underline}**

**[Among the few Republicans to comment on their vote was one of the
party's most anti-NATO voices, Rep.]{.underline}** Thomas
**[Massie]{.underline}** (R-Ky.). **[He called NATO "a relic of the Cold
War" and asked, "Why should Americans pay for Europe's
defense?"]{.underline}**

But while that view exists in some corners of the party, it's one of the
most extreme expressions of the party's posture toward NATO. **[Rep.
Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), another of the 63 "no" votes, articulated a
more nuanced position on Wednesday morning.]{.underline}**

Davidson noted that, apart from the bill's main provision ---
reaffirming "unequivocal support for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization as an alliance founded on democratic principles" --- the
bill contains two other provisions. It calls on President Biden to:

"Adopt a new Strategic Concept for NATO that is clear about its support
for shared democratic values and committed to enhancing NATO's capacity
to strengthen democratic institutions within NATO member, partner, and
aspirant countries."

"Use the voice and vote of the United States to establish a Center for
Democratic Resilience within NATO headquarters."

Of these provisions, Davidson said, "America's sovereignty is
nonnegotiable. I suspect other countries feel the same. ... We should be
strengthening the alliance, not reimagining it as a tool to interfere in
one another's domestic politics."

Some have gone so far as to suggest the provisions will provoke Hungary,
where recently reelected Prime Minister Viktor Orban has taken the
country in an increasingly undemocratic direction. Rep. Andy Harris
(R-Md.) made that case Tuesday, also referencing Poland, which has been
accused of democratic backsliding in recent years.

But **[Davidson]{.underline}** also made clear he didn't like even the
main provision of the bill. He **[suggested affirming our "unequivocal
support" was tantamount to lending our support
unconditionally]{.underline}**. That is highly debatable, but it
reinforces that **[today's NATO debate is not just over the finer
details --- people are also calling into question just how far our
support for NATO and its core principles goes]{.underline}**. And
**[it's not just Massie walking down that road]{.underline}**.

But **[the road is being walked down]{.underline}**, **[and that has
continued after a presidency in which Donald Trump called our NATO
commitments into question]{.underline}** and Republicans, for the most
part, kept him in check. During his presidency, Trump reportedly sought
to leave the alliance entirely --- but back then, Congress repeatedly
responded with a united voice.

The Senate in 2018 passed a bill reaffirming support for NATO 97-2 --- a
pretty direct rebuke to Trump given that he was, at that precise time,
traveling to a NATO summit in Brussels (and would later go to Helsinki,
the site of his infamous news conference with Putin). Weeks later, a
bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill that would have prevented
Trump from withdrawing from NATO. By 2019, the House passed a bill
dubbed the "NATO Support Act," which would have prevented using any
funds "to take any action to withdraw the United States from the North
Atlantic Treaty." Again, the vote was overwhelmingly bipartisan; just 22
Republicans opposed it --- a who's who of the most extreme members of
the party. (The bill was not taken up by the Senate.)

GOP **[opposition to the latest resolution in support of NATO is
significantly higher]{.underline}**. And that's **[despite the new
measure being entirely symbolic]{.underline}** and its predecessor
having been seen, very logically, as a rebuke to Trump. The 2019 measure
had also called for supporting "robust United States funding for the
European Deterrence Initiative, which increases the ability of the
United States and its allies to deter and defend against Russian
aggression."

One wonders how those same House Republicans would vote on such a
measure today. Regardless, all of it suggests **[the party is still
evolving]{.underline}** on this issue --- **[and certainly not in a
pro-NATO direction.]{.underline}**

#### The plan causes backlash from GOP and a greater rift in bipartisan

drift away from supporting the NATO alliance,\",

Accessed 7-13-2022, LASA-LR\]

**[Some two dozen House GOP lawmakers who voted for the 2019 NATO
Support Act voted against the similar resolution this month, which
reaffirmed support for the alliance and its principles]{.underline}**.
But in interviews, **[several of those House Republicans said they still
support the organization and simply objected to what they viewed as
problematic provisions that Democrats had added to the bill for
perceived political purposes.]{.underline}**

**[Several who switched their votes since 2019 objected to measures they
said did not specifically address strengthening NATO to help
Ukraine]{.underline}**. Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) found it
**[particularly problematic that the resolution instructed NATO to be
involved when a country has "internal threats from proponents on
illiberalism]{.underline}**," which he says could be interpreted as
conservatism.

"I am a huge supporter of NATO --- I served in the Air Force during the
Cold War, worked with NATO during that time period," he said. "**[These
issues should be left to those individual nations."]{.underline}**

**[Loudermilk argued that Democrats had inserted "poison pills" into the
symbolic resolution, which could be used against Republicans in the 2022
midterms]{.underline}**. "**[It was the Democrats trying to politicize
something and add things in there that we have no business working
on]{.underline}**," he said, explaining his vote against the bill.

**[But Aderholt said he worried that the resolution "had some language
in that I thought went on the political side. And I don't want to see
NATO go political. I want to see NATO stand up for, you know, what's
going on in Ukraine]{.underline}** --- stand up for Ukraine against
Russia."

### Link -- Alliance Cooperation

#### Plan will cost political capital -- spending resources on alliances saps political strength

**Kupchan, Georgetown International Relations professor, 21**

\[Charles A., 3-2-21, Foreign Affairs, "Colossus Constrained",
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-03-02/colossus-constrained>,

**[The most formidable constraint on Biden's foreign policy is domestic
politics]{.underline}**. Trump may have been a hapless statesman, but he
correctly sensed that **[a sizable portion of the U.S. electorate had
grown weary of seemingly unlimited foreign entanglements]{.underline}**.
**[Many Americans believe that Washington devotes too many resources to
solving the problems of other nations and not enough to solving its
own]{.underline}**. **[It has pursued too many wars,]{.underline}** too
much free trade and immigration, and too **[many costly
alliances]{.underline}** and international pacts that, in Trump's words,
"tie us up and bring America down." **[Biden needs to remain mindful of
the nation's inward turn if he is to maintain his political
strength,]{.underline}** **[keep hold of Congress in the 2022 midterms,
and sustain the domestic investments needed to tame the discontent that
led to Trump's rise. ]{.underline}**

Biden seems to realize as much, asserting in a February 4 speech that
"there's no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy.
Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American
working families in mind. Advancing a foreign policy for the middle
class demands urgent focus on our domestic economic renewal." Still,
there will be tough choices in the months ahead.

Although most Americans welcome the return of a president who stands up
for human rights and democratic allies, **[public support for an
ambitious and expensive foreign policy will be much harder to come
by.]{.underline}** A recent survey showed that around three-quarters of
the U.S. electorate favor a withdrawal from Afghanistan and Iraq, and
**[roughly half want the country to be less engaged militarily around
the world.]{.underline}** Another poll revealed that a majority of
Americans believe the two main threats to the nation come from within:
the pandemic and domestic violent extremism. Among Democrats, the top
five perceived dangers for the United States are the pandemic, climate
change, racial inequality, foreign interference in U.S. elections, and
economic inequity at home. **[Younger Americans]{.underline}**, a key
demographic for Biden, **[care much more about climate change and human
rights than they do about traditional security
issues]{.underline}**. **[Geopolitical threats no longer occupy the
American mind as they once did]{.underline}**.

### Link -- NATO -- Russian Disinfo

#### Support for NATO is costly -- and Russian disinfo magnifies divisiveness

**Cole, Newsweek Senior Reporter, 7-2-22**

(Brendan Cole, Senior Reporter, Newsweek, 7-2-22, \"Putin to exploit
U.S. economic pain to bring Biden midterms misery---experts,\"

**[The intelligence community has already raised concerns
that]{.underline}** Vladimir **[Putin will draw on the playbook of cyber
attacks and propaganda which evidence shows impacted the 2016 and 2020
U.S. elections.]{.underline}**

**[But costly U.S. support for Ukraine as Americans battle soaring
inflation, which Biden blames on Putin, as well as a possible recession,
could give the Kremlin ample opportunity to exploit division as voters
go to the polls in November.]{.underline}**

\"**[Anything Putin can do to sow doubt in Americans\' minds about the
moral necessity, economic cost and practical impact of our support for
Ukraine\'s sovereignty, he surely will attempt,\"]{.underline}** Stephen
**[Hanson, vice provost for academic and international affairs at
Virginia\'s College of William & Mary told Newsweek.]{.underline}**

The concerns come as **[former U.S. intelligence officials have warned
that Putin will try to get Americans to question their support for
Ukraine and promote politicians who can reverse
sanctions.]{.underline}**

Homeland and national security officials told CNN that [Russia might be
considering staging hacks of local election authorities, with the
deliberate purpose of being noticed]{.underline}. [They could then use
that to promote more conspiracies about the integrity of American
elections, which could be amplified on Facebook and
Twitter.]{.underline}

A declassified report by the Department of Homeland Security\'s (DHS)
Office of Intelligence and Analysis warned [that Russia would likely
depress voting and undermine the midterms in revenge for the U.S.-led
response to the invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}

The DHS report, which also described threats coming from China and Iran,
said that [Moscow would view this as an \"equitable response\"
to]{.underline} U.S. actions over Ukraine.

These include tough [sanctions on Russia as well as Washington providing
\$1.4 billion in a security aid package to Kyiv]{.underline} that
included High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS.

But [with inflation]{.underline} in the U.S. at 11 percent [and Biden
repeatedly connecting Putin\'s name with the economic
turmoil]{.underline} they are feeling right now, [Americans might balk
in the coming months at their support for Ukraine, which the Kremlin
could tap into.]{.underline}

\"[They can exploit a number of existing realities. One of those
realities is the economic toll that the war is taking on the United
States, especially as we see in inflation and gas prices. That creates
an enormous political vulnerability, a political
opportunity]{.underline},\" said Ken Osgood, humanities professor at
Colorado School of Mines.

\"[People will start asking \'is this war really worth all the economic
pain or suffering]{.underline}?\' and Russia will almost certainly
exacerbate those concerns,\" he told Newsweek.

\"It has a tremendous power of amplifying messages,\" he said, \"It can
take the voices that are already out there and add more, make them
louder, through Twitter feeds and bots and things of that nature.\"

Osgood said [Moscow does not need to push a linear argument that the war
is directly causing inflation but instead exploit how people \"see the
connections between parallel arguments]{.underline}.\" He said
conservative outlets like Fox News might pin inflation on Biden, noting
the war in Ukraine, while hosts like Tucker Carlson might \"put out the
message, raising doubts about our framing of Russia, and \'is Putin
really all that bad?\'\"

[\"Russia doesn\'t necessarily need to connect the dots. It just needs
to put those fears out there. And then other people connect the dots and
then those voices get amplified]{.underline},\" Osgood said.

**[Polling in June]{.underline}** on the Russia-Ukraine crisis tracker
**[showed a dip in support for U.S. financial help for Ukraine. Less
than a half]{.underline}** (46 percent) [of U.S. voters say their
government should impose sanctions on Russian oil, even if it causes
prices to rise, down 9 percentage points since April.]{.underline}

Andrea Molle, assistant political science professor, at Chapman
University, California said **[that Russia and other hostile foreign
interests \"would try and frame the financial and military efforts in
support of Ukraine as a waste of resources that should be used
domestically instead]{.underline}**.\"

\"**[The focus will be on increasing polarization and criticism towards
President Biden and the democratic majority,]{.underline}**\" he told
Newsweek.

\"**[The U.S. is traditionally a country with a very short attention
span for all things international, coupled with what I call \'conspiracy
theory epidemics.\' Linking the narrative of the alleged inability to
face the current economic crisis to the efforts and involvement in
Ukraine would catch two birds with one stone.]{.underline}**\"

\"On the one hand, **[it will hinder the current administration\'s
chances of maintaining control of Congress]{.underline}**. On the other
hand, **[it will force the president, and his majority, to reconsider
the U.S. involvement in the war, potentially jeopardizing Ukraine\'s
chances of effectively resisting the invasion]{.underline}**. **[All
this, in the long term, could also weaken NATO.\"]{.underline}**

The Kremlin\'s actions leading up to the midterms would be the latest
chapter in its attempts to sow discord in U.S. politics.

Influence operations linked to the Russian government Internet Research
Agency (IRA), which was at the center of U.S. election meddling claims,
exploited vaccination debates even before the COVID pandemic.

### AT -- NATO/Democracy Popular

#### Plan will spark GOP backlash -- even over NATO's core values

**Blake, Washington Post The Fix Senior Political Reporter, 22**

(Aaron, 4-6-22, The Washington Post, \"Why 30 percent of the House GOP
voted against reaffirming NATO
support\", https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/06/house-gop-nato-support/, accessed
on 7-12-22, SR)

A quarter-century ago, the U.S. Senate was faced with a major question:
whether to ratify expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) to include Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, which would
bring the alliance closer to Russia's border. The public generally
supported NATO expansion, as did both President Bill Clinton and his
1996 GOP opponent, Bob Dole. [Still, one foreign policy expert at the
time said the ratification would require a "feat of magic": Support for
NATO expansion was shallow, and senators had hugely varied
priorities.]{.underline}

[Complicating matters, a Republican-controlled Senate had never joined
with a Democratic president to expand NATO.]{.underline} Indeed, that
partisan dynamic resulted in the defeat of the Treaty of Versailles in
1919.

In the end, though, Republicans provided the bulk of the votes to make
it happen. [The ratification passed in "strikingly bipartisan" fashion,
as The Washington Post recounted at the time. It reached the required
two-thirds threshold with plenty of votes to spare; 45 of the 80 "yes"
votes came from Republicans.]{.underline}

**[Times have certainly changed.]{.underline}**

On Tuesday, 63 House Republicans voted against a symbolic resolution
reaffirming support for NATO and its principles, amid Russia's invasion
of Ukraine. [The "no" votes comprised more than 30 percent of the
party's conference.]{.underline}

As with any such symbolic resolution, it's worth parsing exactly what it
contains. Oftentimes, these resolutions are crafted to force the other
party into a politically difficult vote by including smaller provisions
or loaded language they might object to, then accusing them of opposing
the overall (and often popular) thrust of the bill.

But even accounting for those details, [this vote marks the latest shift
away from what was once a bipartisan, consensus view in Congress ---
supporting NATO and its importance in keeping Russia in check**. And the
shift continues apace.**]{.underline}

Few Republicans have commented on their reasons for opposing the
resolution, but writer Will Saletan previewed the vote Tuesday by noting
a number of ways in which the party has drifted in a more
Russia-ambivalent and even NATO-skeptical direction. [Among the emerging
views he isolated: **that NATO was at fault for provoking Vladimir
Putin, that we should focus instead on our own Southern border, and that
the United States has no business defending European allies, whether in
NATO or otherwise.**]{.underline}

**[Among the few Republicans to comment on their vote was one of the
party's most anti-NATO voices, Rep]{.underline}**. Thomas
**[Massie]{.underline}** (R-Ky.). **[He called NATO "a relic of the Cold
War" and asked, "Why should Americans pay for Europe's
defense?"]{.underline}**

But while that view exists in some corners of the party, it's one of the
most extreme expressions of the party's posture toward NATO. Rep. Warren
Davidson (R-Ohio), another of the 63 "no" votes, articulated a more
nuanced position on Wednesday morning.

**[Davidson noted that, apart from the bill's main
provision]{.underline}** --- reaffirming "unequivocal support for the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization as an alliance founded on democratic
principles" --- **[the bill contains two other provisions. It calls on
President Biden to:]{.underline}**

**[to:]{.underline}**

1.  **["Adopt a new Strategic Concept for NATO that is clear about its
    support for shared democratic values and committed to enhancing
    NATO's capacity to strengthen democratic institutions within NATO
    member, partner, and aspirant countries."]{.underline}**

2.  **["Use the voice and vote of the United States to establish a
    Center for Democratic Resilience within NATO
    headquarters."]{.underline}**

Of these provisions**[, Davidson said, "America's sovereignty is
nonnegotiable. I suspect other countries feel the same. ... We should be
strengthening the alliance, not reimagining it as a tool to interfere in
one another's domestic politics."]{.underline}**

**[Some have gone so far as to suggest the provisions will provoke
Hungary]{.underline}**, where recently reelected Prime Minister Viktor
Orban has taken the country in an increasingly undemocratic direction.
Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) made that case Tuesday, also referencing
Poland, which has been accused of democratic backsliding in recent
years.

But Davidson also made clear he didn't like even the main provision of
the bill. He suggested affirming our "unequivocal support" was
tantamount to lending our support unconditionally. **[That is highly
debatable, but it reinforces that today's NATO debate is not just over
the finer details --- people are also calling into question just how far
our support for NATO and its core principles goes. And it's not just
Massie walking down that road.]{.underline}**

**[But the road is being walked down, and that has continued after a
presidency in which Donald Trump called our NATO commitments into
question and Republicans, for the most part, kept him in
check.]{.underline}** During his presidency, Trump reportedly sought to
leave the alliance entirely --- but back then, Congress repeatedly
responded with a united voice.

The Senate in 2018 passed a bill reaffirming support for NATO 97-2 --- a
pretty direct rebuke to Trump given that he was, at that precise time,
traveling to a NATO summit in Brussels (and would later go to Helsinki,
the site of his infamous news conference with Putin). Weeks later, a
bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill that would have prevented
Trump from withdrawing from NATO. By 2019, the House passed a bill
dubbed the "NATO Support Act," which would have prevented using any
funds "to take any action to withdraw the United States from the North
Atlantic Treaty." Again, the vote was overwhelmingly bipartisan; just 22
Republicans opposed it --- a who's who of the most extreme members of
the party. (The bill was not taken up by the Senate.)

[GOP opposition to the latest resolution in support of NATO is
significantly higher.]{.underline} And that's despite the new measure
being entirely symbolic and its predecessor having been seen, very
logically, as a rebuke to Trump. The 2019 measure had also called for
supporting "robust United States funding for the European Deterrence
Initiative, which increases the ability of the United States and its
allies to deter and defend against Russian aggression."

One wonders how those same House Republicans would vote on such a
measure today. Regardless, **[all of it suggests the party is still
evolving on this issue --- and certainly not in a pro-NATO
direction.]{.underline}**

#### No link turn -- unending war in Ukraine is exhausting American military resources and support

Allies Continue to Shape the War in
Ukraine\", https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/09/us/politics/ukraine-strategy-biden.html, accessed
on 7-13-22, SR)

WASHINGTON --- Another day, another weapons shipment: [On Friday, the
Pentagon announced a new transfer of precision-guided shells and
multiple rocket launchers to Ukraine]{.underline}, the latest armaments
heading east. **[But will there come a day when that system begins to
slow?]{.underline}**

More than four months after Russia invaded Ukraine, a war that was
expected to be a Russian blitzkrieg only to turn into a debacle for
Moscow has now evolved into a battle of inches with no end in sight, a
geopolitical stamina contest in which President Vladimir V. Putin is
gambling that he can outlast a fickle, impatient West.

[President Biden has vowed to stand with Ukraine for "as long as it
takes," but neither he nor anyone else can say how long that will be or
how much more the United States and its allies can do over that
distance, short of direct military intervention.]{.underline} At some
point, officials acknowledge, U.S. and European stocks of weapons will
run low; while the United States has authorized \$54 billion in military
and other assistance, no one expects another \$54 billion check when
that runs out.

So Mr. Biden and his team are searching for a long-term strategy at a
time when the White House sees the dangers of escalation increasing, the
prospect for a negotiated settlement still far-off and public weariness
beginning to set in at home and abroad.

["I worry about the fatigue factor of the public in a wide range of
countries because of the economic costs and because there are other
pressing concerns,]{.underline}" said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of
Delaware and a close ally of Mr. Biden's who attended the NATO summit
meeting in Madrid last week.

"I think we need to be determined and continue to support Ukraine," said
Mr. Coons, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "Exactly
how long this will go, exactly what the trajectory will be, we don't
know right now. But we know if we don't continue to support Ukraine, the
outcome for the U.S. will be much worse."

While the fighting lately has focused mainly on a crescent in eastern
and southern Ukraine, the White House worries it could easily spiral out
of control. [A recent missile strike on a shopping center in central
Ukraine suggested that Moscow was running low on precision weaponry and
increasingly turning to less sophisticated armaments that could hit
unintended targets --- potentially even across the border, in NATO
allies like Poland or Romania. And American officials worry that Mr.
Putin may resort to tactical nuclear weapons to break out of the box he
faces on the battlefield.]{.underline}

Indeed, the Biden administration has concluded that the Russian leader
still wants to widen the war and try again to seize Kyiv, the Ukrainian
capital. "We think he has effectively the same political goals that we
had previously, which is to say that he wants to take most of Ukraine,"
Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, said at a
conference last week.

[Mr. Putin almost seemed to confirm that on Thursday, when he warned
that he had more expansive options available. "Everybody should know
that, largely speaking, we haven't even yet started anything in
earnest," he told parliamentary leaders in Moscow.]{.underline}

**["We are hearing that they want to defeat us on the battlefield," Mr.
Putin added. "Let them try."]{.underline}**

U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss
strategy deliberations, are urging the Ukrainians to consolidate their
forces at the front. [But Ukraine's leaders want to go further and mass
enough personnel to mount a counteroffensive to retake territory, a goal
that American officials support in theory even if they are dubious about
the Ukrainians' capacity to dislodge the Russians. President Volodymyr
Zelensky of Ukraine told Group of 7 leaders last week that he wanted the
war over by the end of the year. **But there are serious doubts in
Washington about whether that is possible militarily.**]{.underline}

Better Understand the Russia-Ukraine War

The Biden administration does not want to be seen pressuring Mr.
Zelensky to negotiate a deal with the Kremlin at the risk of rewarding
armed aggression, **[but officials and analysts said it would be hard to
sustain the same level of material support as war fatigue grows on both
sides of the Atlantic.]{.underline}** [Military aid passed by Congress
is expected to last into the second quarter of next year, by some
estimates, but the question is how long current supplies of weapons and
ammunition can last without degrading the military readiness of the
United States.]{.underline}

American officials have encouraged other countries to provide leftover
stores of Soviet-made weaponry that Ukrainians are more familiar with
--- an item on Mr. Biden's agenda for a trip to the Middle East next
week, when he is scheduled to meet with leaders of Arab states that were
once clients of Moscow.

"There is a lot of running room, but clearly there is this sense that
the next six months are really critical," said Ivo H. Daalder, the
president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a former U.S.
ambassador to NATO. [**"In the next six months, we're going to find out
one or both sides are too exhausted**, and they're going to look for a
way out."]{.underline}

#### GOP support for Ukraine is fracturing -- ensuring debate about the plan

**Martin and Schmidt, NPR All Things Considered Host, MSNBC and NBC News
political analyst, , 22** 

(Michel and Steve, 2-19-2022, National Public Radio, All Things
Considered, \"Why Republicans are divided on support for
Ukraine\", https://www.npr.org/2022/02/19/1081987370/why-republicans-are-divided-on-support-for-ukraine, accessed
on 7-13-2022, SR)

NPR\'s Michel Martin discusses why the Republican Party has had a warmer
posture towards Russia in recent years with former Republican strategist
Steve Schmidt.

MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:

If you\'re a student of history and if you keep up with international
affairs now, here\'s something that you might have found particularly
jarring in recent weeks and months - an array of conservative pundits
and lawmakers downplaying, even dismissing Russia\'s pressure campaign
against Ukraine.

JOSH HAWLEY: And right now, we\'ve got to put American security
interests first. And that means we\'ve got to focus on China, and we\'ve
got to focus on our own borders. We need to ask our European allies to
do more.

MARTIN: That was U.S. Senator Josh Hawley speaking with Fox News host
Tucker Carlson. One of the ideas once unifying the Republican Party was
opposition to Russia\'s communist influence around the world. When the
Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, there was hope for a new era of
international cooperation or at least detente. **[But now with the
threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, Republicans aren\'t just
divided. Some are actively working against support for the only
nation-state with a functional democracy. So how did that
happen?]{.underline}**

**[We called]{.underline}** Steve **[Schmidt to get his take on this. He
is a former Republican strategist]{.underline}**. He worked on President
George W. Bush\'s reelection campaign, Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s campaign
for governor of California and the late Senator John McCain\'s 2008
presidential run. He left the Republican Party after the election of
Donald Trump and co-founded a group formed to oppose him. And he\'s with
us now. Steve Schmidt, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us.

STEVE SCHMIDT: It\'s a real pleasure to be with you.

MARTIN: So until you left the Republican Party, you spent pretty much
your adult life in Republican politics and policy. **[So how important
was anti-communism as a core value of the GOP at that
time?]{.underline}**

SCHMIDT: **[Well, it wasn\'t just a core value of the Republican Party.
It was a core value of national politics, manifested, you know, by the
presidencies of Truman, Eisenhower, John Kennedy, who was a giant foe of
communism]{.underline}**. And the Cold War ended essentially on Ronald
Reagan and George Bush 41\'s watches. [And this U.S.-led, rules-based
world that the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights exists in, free trade,
the idea that borders are not breakable or movable by a greater power
invading - and what the Russians are asserting regarding Ukraine, which
is a giant country with 40 million people, is that we can invade and
shatter an international boundary and border because we are the stronger
nation.]{.underline} And that\'s the hour the world stands upon.

MARTIN: I think people will remember, you know, even now, even people
who didn\'t live through that era, that sort of - that\'s kind of one of
those iconic Ronald Reagan moments of President Reagan famously telling
the then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. I
mean, to this day, if you don\'t know any other moment from the Reagan
presidency, then you probably know that one. **[So how did it get to
some members downplaying Russian actions and actually criticizing
efforts to defend and support Ukraine? How did that
happen?]{.underline}**

SCHMIDT: [**It means something when Tucker Carlson goes to Hungary and
fetishizes Viktor Orban**.]{.underline} It means something when the
largest grassroots organization in the Republican Party says that we
will hold our conference in Hungary, a country teeming with
anti-Semitism with an autocratic-ish leader who\'s taken control mostly
of the nation\'s media. And you look at Turkey, where 35,000 people have
been locked up in recent years for insulting the president, right? This
is the vision that they like, right? This is the autocratic fetish -
right? - that they have. [This new fascism is ascendant in countries all
over the world to subvert as much as they can this idea of the U.S.-led
liberal global order]{.underline}, which has worked pretty well, in my
estimation, for the last 75 years.

MARTIN: What is the vision of someone like one of the - you mentioned
Tucker Carlson. He\'s a major voice in conservative media at Fox News.
As you mentioned over the last couple of months, **[he\'s repeatedly
questioned U.S. support for Ukraine, attacked Republicans who disagree
with him, even making a visit to sort of Hungary. But, like, what\'s his
vision? What\'s the idea here? What\'s the endgame here?]{.underline}**

SCHMIDT: **[If you made me guess, I would say he wants power and
money.]{.underline}** But I think it\'s important to historically
understand - Colonel Robert McCormick, who ran The Chicago Tribune, I
think, they published the codes or the fact that the United States had
broken the Japanese codes, and that was why we had been successful in
Midway. And he did it because he hated Roosevelt. This was one of the
most important secrets of the war. We have always had no shortage of
people in this country that are susceptible to this type of stuff. And
so we\'re seeing right now a political philosophy forming.

[**It means a great deal when you have a Republican National Committee,
one of only two major political parties in the country, embrace the
chaos and murderous insurrection and the violence,** the defecation in
the hallways of the Capitol, the urinating on the walls as legitimate
political discourse, right? So all of this - right? - is part of a
movement in this country, an ongoing event, a worsening situation, a
growing hostility to the basic covenant between us around how we
apportion and share power lawfully, not in a world where it\'s just
taken by the strong, who could do whatever they want to the
weak.]{.underline} That\'s what\'s on the table here, both
internationally and domestically.

MARTIN: So before we let you go, **[do you think that not just the Biden
administration but those remaining within the Republican Party who see
the world as you do, who see the sort of post-Cold War world order in
jeopardy here - are they doing enough to make that case to the American
people, who, for whatever reason, whether it\'s the skeptics in
Congress, whether it\'s their, you know, Fox News, whatever - do you
think they\'re doing enough to sort of make the case to the American
people?]{.underline}**

SCHMIDT: **[My personal view is that the answer to that question is no.
That being said, I think that President Biden, who has come out now
twice to brief the nation about these momentous events, has been superb
in explaining and explicating what\'s happening.]{.underline}** And at a
personal level, I would, you know, hope to see him do more of that, to
walk out behind the presidential podium every day and, I would hope
also, at every opportunity, address the Russian people. That - here in
the United States, we have millions of Russians, tens of millions
who\'ve built lives in this land. The Russian people are our friends. We
don\'t wish suffering for Russian mothers and the death of their
children in a war caused by Vladimir Putin. I hope the president will
explain that to the Russian people and remember that he speaks to the
entire world every time he appears from behind the presidential podium.
And so we are at the edge of a momentous event that is entirely within
the control of Vladimir Putin to trigger into a momentous tragedy or to
de-escalate it. And we will see what happens in these next days as
Russian forces continue to congregate and surround Ukraine ready for
offensive military action. They are in an offensive posture. Make no
mistake about that. [And I think the world hangs on the edge of
witnessing the first major war of the 21st century.]{.underline}

MARTIN: Well, those are sobering words. That\'s Steve Schmidt. He\'s a
former Republican strategist who worked for President George W. Bush,
the late Senator John McCain. And he\'s the co-founder of the Lincoln
Project, which was formed to oppose former President Donald Trump and

#### Plan can't help Biden -- he doesn't get credit -- only blame -- on Ukraine policy

**[More than 6 in 10 Americans want the U.S. to give Ukraine some of the
support it wants, while still trying to avoid a larger military conflict
with Russia.]{.underline}** Fewer than 2 in 10 say the U.S. should give
Ukraine everything it wants, even if it risks a wider war.

**[Those responses were remarkably consistent across the political
spectrum with strong majorities of Republicans, Democrats and
independents all in agreement. But when Americans are asked to assess
President Biden\'s performance, that bipartisan consensus breaks
down.]{.underline}**

\"What he\'s doing is fundamentally what the American people want,\"
Jackson said. \"But **[even if Biden is doing everything that people
want to do, he\'s not going to get a lot of credit for
it.\"]{.underline}**

**[Disapproval is highest among Republicans]{.underline}**

**[Overall, only 36% of Americans say Biden is doing a good job in
response to the war in Ukraine, while 52% say he\'s not]{.underline}**.
**[That disapproval is driven largely by the GOP: 81% of Republicans
rated Biden\'s response as fair or poor. On the other hand, 62% of
Democrats described the president\'s response as good or
excellent.]{.underline}**

And 45% of respondents say President Biden has been too cautious in
supporting Ukraine. Only 7% think the U.S. should be doing less in
Ukraine, compared with 39% who think it should be doing more.

**[The G-7 and NATO summits,]{.underline}** which will take place this

**[likely to join the defense pact. That move is a reflection of how
Putin's invasion of Ukraine has changed security considerations across
Europe and strengthened the alliance he sought to test.]{.underline}**

**[Despite the transatlantic unity, Russia's war continues to ravage
eastern Ukraine, and its outcome remains uncertain. The Western
triumphalism of the conflict's early months may be fading as the U.S.
and its allies grapple with the war's effects on inflation, food and
energy supplies and leaders' poll numbers. Americans, riveted early on
by live coverage of the conflict, are paying less attention, focusing
more on high gas prices, a shortage of baby formula and mass
shootings]{.underline}** --- **[issues that, with the midterm elections
fast approaching, Biden and Democrats will be highlighting as
well.]{.underline}**

willing to inflict on our own citizens, and Putin does not. We have a

### Link -- Tech Backlash

**Technology policy sparks vocal backlash -- ensures it will be
divisive**

**Atkinson, Information Technology and Innovation Foundation
president, 14**

\[Robert Atkinson, a Canadian-American economist, 3-26-14,
InformationWeek, \"Tech Fear-Mongering Must Stop\",
<https://www.informationweek.com/executive-insights-and-innovation/tech-fear-mongering-must-stop>,
accessed on 7-9-22, MG\]

Since the first Industrial Revolution, **[technological change has
brought disruption and progress, with the disrupted often rejecting that
change]{.underline}**. Most famously, in the early 1800s a group of
Englishmen called Luddites destroyed textile machines that were
replacing hand-operated looms. But if progress has sometimes been a
dubious, if not rejected, value in nations, America was always
different. Founded by risk-takers and optimists, Americans have long
thought that newer is better and that you can\'t stand in the way of
progress. Other nations, constrained by the shackles of the past and the
resisters of the present, have viewed that American spirit as simply
extraordinary. Even Joseph Stalin proclaimed: \"American efficiency is
that indomitable spirit which neither knows nor will be deterred by any
obstacle\... that simply must go through with a job once it has been
tackled.\" [Today, however, **increasingly vocal neo-Luddites in this
country argue that progress is a force to be stopped, not encouraged.
They want a world in which a worker never loses a job, even when the new
technology behind it leads to higher employment; a world in which
consumer rights trump all other considerations, even lower prices; a
world in which no personal information is shared, even if sharing
benefits individuals and companies alike. In short, they want to slow
advancement at all costs, even when those costs ultimately hurt the
public they\'re trying to protect.**]{.underline}

**[We can forgive the average American for believing this narrative,
given the many influential advocacy groups, media outlets, and academics
that promote this view of the world. \"60 Minutes\" and the Associated
Press have featured stories on the perils of automation, and prominent
academics, including MIT\'s]{.underline}** Andrew **[McAfee
and]{.underline}** Eric **[Brynjolfsson, are telling us that machines
kill jobs,]{.underline}** despite the overwhelming evidence to the
contrary. **[Numerous media outlets have also taken up the false
argument that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are dangerous and
should be curbed or banned. One example is the \"balanced\" PBS
documentary \"Seeds of Death.\" And almost all coverage of new
information technology comes with the obligatory \"this is the end of
privacy as we know it\" warning.]{.underline}**

**[What has changed? At least three things:]{.underline}**

[**First, we\'re seeing the spread of foundation-funded advocacy groups
\-- the likes of the Sierra Club, Free Press, and the ridiculously
misnamed Center for Food Safety \-- whose mission is to challenge
technological progress on behalf of those purportedly hurt by it. These
groups rely on fear-mongering to retain their foundation funding and
drum up their grassroots donations**.]{.underline} Even technologies as
straightforward and benign as smart electric meters now mobilize
neo-Luddite opposition from groups such as the cleverly named
stopsmartmeters.org, in the name of protecting consumers\' privacy.

**[Second, academics realize that the key to making a name for
themselves is to write the \"dog bites man\" article or book that tells
us why Google is making us stupid, why we are losing the war against
machines, how we are now a \"captive audience\" to broadband providers,
and why we need to fear what the Internet is doing to our
brains.]{.underline}**

I risk sounding old-fashioned, but when I received my PhD in the 1980s,
academics were expected to leave bias and advocacy to the amateurs.
Their job was to strive for objectivity. But objectivity no longer sells
or gets you that coveted TED Talk.

**[Third, the media face the same market pressures as civil society
groups and academics. They maximize the number of eyeballs on their
content when they portray technology as fearsome and imposed by
powerful, impersonal governments and corporations.]{.underline}**

[**As the neo-Luddites drown out the voices of progress**, **the ability
of true progressives** (i.e., those individuals and organizations
advancing progress) **to drive development is diminished. It is
unlikely, for example, that America will ever again lead the world in
funding science and technology**]{.underline}. We now rank 24th out of
39 nations in government-funded university research, behind the likes of
South Korea, France, and Estonia. **[It is also unlikely that we will be
able to enact sophisticated national innovation policies, such as those
created by Denmark and Germany. There\'s too much mistrust of government
in the US for that.]{.underline}** Where we could still trump other
nations is in our unalloyed embrace of progress, but we\'re at risk of
losing our American exceptionalism as we become cautious and fearful.
Ned Ludd would be proud.

### Link -- Tech Lobby Backlash

#### Plan will drain capital -- Big Tech vigorously challenges regulation

**Kang, New York Times technology regulation reporter, 22 **

\[Cecilia Kang, 4-22-22, The New York Times, \"As Europe Approves New
Tech Laws, the U.S. Falls Further Behind\",
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/technology/tech-regulation-europe-us.html>,
accessed on 7-11-22, MG\]

[In just the last few years, Europe has seen a sweeping law for online
privacy take effect, approved far-reaching regulations to curb the
dominance of the tech giants and on Saturday reached a deal on new
legislation to protect its citizens from harmful online
content.]{.underline}

[For those keeping score, that's Europe: three. United States:
zero.]{.underline}

[The United States may be the birthplace of the iPhone and the most
widely used search engine and social network, and it could also bring
the world into the so-called metaverse. But global leadership on tech
regulations is taking place more than 3,000 miles from Washington, by
European leaders representing 27 nations with 24 languages, who have
nonetheless been able to agree on basic online protections for their 450
million or so citizens]{.underline}.

[In the United States, Congress has not passed a single piece of
comprehensive regulation to protect internet consumers and to rein in
the power of its technology giants.]{.underline}

[It's not for lack of trying. Over 25 years, dozens of federal privacy
bills have been proposed and then ultimately dropped without bipartisan
support. With every major hack of a bank or retailer, lawmakers have
introduced data breach and security bills, all of which have withered on
the vine. A flurry of speech bills have sunk into the quicksand of
partisan disagreements over freedoms of expression. And antitrust bills
to curtail the power of Apple, Amazon, Google and Meta, the owner of
Facebook and Instagram, have sat in limbo amid fierce lobbying
opposition]{.underline}.

[Only two narrow federal tech laws have been enacted --- one for
children's privacy and the other for ridding sites of sex-trafficking
content --- in the past 25 years.]{.underline}

["Inertia is too kind of a word to describe what's happened in the
United States; there's been a lack of will, courage and understanding of
the problem and technologies," said Jeffrey Chester, the executive
director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a public interest group.
"And consumers are left with no protections here and lots of
confusion."]{.underline}

[The prospects that any legislation will pass imminently are dim, though
regulations at some point are almost inevitable because of the way tech
touches so many aspects of life. Of all the proposals currently in front
of Congress, an antitrust bill that would bar Apple, Alphabet and Amazon
from boosting their own products on their marketplaces and app stores
over those of their rivals has the best shot.]{.underline}

A co-author of the bill, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota,
said Democratic leaders had promised it would go to a vote by this
summer. But even that bill, [with bipartisan support, faces an uphill
climb amid so many other priorities in Congress and a fierce tech
lobbying effort to defeat it.]{.underline}

[If history is a guide, the path toward U.S. tech regulation will be
long. It took decades of public anger to regulate the railroads through
the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887. It took
nearly 50 years from the first medical reports on the dangers of
cigarettes to the regulation of tobacco.]{.underline}

[There's no single reason for the sludge of progress in Congress.
Proposals have been caught in the age-old partisan divide over how to
protect consumers while also encouraging the growth of business. Then
there are the hundreds of tech lobbyists who block legislation that
could dampen their profits. Lawmakers have also at times failed to grasp
the technologies they are trying to regulate, turning their public
foibles over tech into internet memes.]{.underline}

[Tech companies have taken advantage of that knowledge blind spot, said
Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission.]{.underline}

["It's what I call the 'big con,' where the tech companies spin a story
that they are doing magic and that if Washington touches their companies
with regulations they'll be responsible for breaking that
magic,"]{.underline} he said.

In the vacuum of federal regulations, states have created a patchwork of
tech rules instead. California, Virginia, Utah and Colorado have adopted
their own privacy laws. Florida and Texas have passed social media laws
aimed at punishing internet platforms for censoring conservative views.

Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft said they supported federal
regulations. But when pressed, some of them have fought for the most
permissive versions of the laws that have been under consideration.
Meta, for instance, has pushed for weaker federal privacy legislation
that would override stronger laws in the states.

[Tech's lobbying power is now on full display in Washington with the
threat of the antitrust bill from Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Charles E.
Grassley, a Republican of Iowa. The proposal passed its first hurdle of
votes in January, much to the tech industry's surprise.]{.underline}

[In response, many of the tech companies mobilized an extensive lobbying
and marketing campaign to defeat the bill. Through a trade group, Amazon
claimed in television and newspaper ads that the bill would effectively
end its Prime membership program. Kent Walker, Google's chief legal
officer, wrote in a blog post that the legislation would "break" popular
products and prevent the company from displaying Google maps in search
results.]{.underline}

[Ms. Klobuchar said the companies' claims were hyperbole. She warned
that by fighting the proposal, tech companies might be choosing the
worse of two difficult options.]{.underline}

["They are letting Europe set the agenda on internet regulation," Ms.
Klobuchar said. "At least we listened to everyone's concerns and
modified our bill."]{.underline}

The inaction may appear surprising given that Republicans and Democrats
are ostensibly in lock step over how tech companies have morphed into
global powerhouses.

["Consumers need confidence that their data is being protected, and
businesses need to know they can keep innovating while complying with a
strong, workable national privacy standard," said Senator Roger Wicker,
Republican of Mississippi. "The U.S. cannot afford to cede leadership on
this issue."]{.underline}

Lawmakers have also forced many tech chief executives --- including Jeff
Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark
Zuckerberg of Meta --- to testify multiple times before Congress in
recent years. In some of those televised hearings, lawmakers of both
parties have told the executives that their companies --- with a
combined \$6.4 trillion in market value --- aren't above government or
public accountability.

["Some of these companies are countries, not companies," Senator John
Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, said in a January antitrust hearing,
adding that they are "killing fields for the truth."]{.underline}

[But so far, the **talk has not translated into new laws.** The path to
privacy regulations provides the clearest case study on that record of
inaction.]{.underline}

Since 1995, Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, has
introduced a dozen privacy bills for internet service providers, drones
and third-party data brokers. In 2018, the year Europe's General Data
Protection Regulation took effect, he proposed a bill to require a
consumer's permission to share or sell data.

Mr. Markey also tried twice to update and strengthen privacy legislation
for youths following his 1998 law, the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act.

**[With every effort, industry lobbying groups have denounced the bills
as harmful to innovation. Many Republican lawmakers have opposed the
proposals, saying they don't balance the needs of
businesses.]{.underline}**

[**"Big Tech sees data as dollar signs, so for decades they've
bankrolled industry lobbyists to help them evade accountability,"**
Mr.]{.underline} Markey said. ["We've reached a breaking
point."]{.underline}

fostered innovation.\[8\]]{.underline}**

Increased investments in Washington have allowed these monopolists to
harm consumers, workers, and other businesses alike, with relatively
little accountability to date. A [report Public Citizen released in
2019](https://www.citizen.org/article/new-economy-titans-old-school-tactics/?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId=5d62d87d-0456-4903-a47d-19602d1e1ad8) (covering
up to the 2018 election cycle) detailed how Big Tech corporations have
blanketed Capitol Hill with lobbyists and lavished members of Congress
with campaign contributions.

This is an update of that report, based on data provided by the [Center
for Responsive Politics](https://www.opensecrets.org/). Since the 2020
election cycle has ended, **[Public Citizen reevaluated Big Tech's
influence over the government by analyzing the tech companies' lobbying
spending and campaign contributions.]{.underline}**

Here are the key findings of this report:

Facebook and Amazon are now the two biggest corporate lobbying
spenders in the country.\[9\]

**[Big Tech has eclipsed yesterday's big lobbying spenders, Big Oil and
Big Tobacco.]{.underline}** In 2020, Amazon and Facebook spent nearly
twice as much as Exxon and Philip Morris on lobbying.

During the 2020 election cycle, Big Tech spent \$124 million in lobbying
and campaign contributions ---- breaking its own records from past
election cycles.

Amazon and Facebook drove most of this growth. From the years of
2018-2020, Amazon increased spending by 30% while Facebook added an
astounding 56% to its Washington investment.

The four **[Big Tech companies recruited more lobbyists into their army,
increasing its ranks by 40 new lobbyists, from 293 in 2018 to 333 in
2020]{.underline}**.\[10\]

**[Big Tech PACs, lobbyists, and employees contributed over 33% more in
the 2020 election cycle than they did in the 2018 cycle, for an increase
of over \$4 million in funds, and a total of nearly \$16.5 million in
contributions to the election cycle. This marks the greatest
cycle-over-cycle increase in campaign contributions from Big Tech in the
ten-year span Public Citizen reviewed.]{.underline}**

Big Tech's **[lobbyists are not just numerous, they are also among the
most influential in Washington. Among the 10 lobbyists who were the
biggest contributors to the 2020 election cycle, half lobby on behalf of
at least one of the four Big Tech companies]{.underline}**. Together,
just these five lobbyists contributed over \$2 million to the 2020
elections.

Nearly all (94%) members of Congress with jurisdiction over privacy and
antitrust issues have received money from a Big Tech corporate PAC or
lobbyist. In total, just in 2020, Big Tech PACs and lobbyists
have contributed about \$3.2 million to lawmakers tasked with regulating
them.

Introduction

[Previous

Public Citizen revealed how Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google (now
organized as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.) had each dramatically
increased their lobbying spending and presence in Washington, D.C. from
2010 to 2018. In the 2010 election cycle, these four companies spent
\$19.2 million lobbying Congress. In just eight years, their spending
grew to \$118 million. This trend also held true for political
contributions, which grew by more than 400 percent from the 2010 cycle
to the 2018 cycle.

Although **[all four companies pushed staggering amounts of money into
D.C., Amazon increased its spending the fastest. From 2016 to 2018,

### Link -- Cyber Debate

#### Cyber triggers debate -- multiple aspects of policy are subject to dispute and evolving interpretation based on tech advances

**Vinik, POLITICO The Agenda Assistant Editor, 15**

(Danny Vinik, assistant editor for The Agenda at Politico, POLITICO,
12-9-15, \"America's secret arsenal,\" The Agenda,
https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/12/defense-department-cyber-offense-strategy-000331/,
accessed 7-13-22) SS:/

WHILE **[THE DEBATE over U.S. offensive cyber strategy may be happening
quietly in the federal government, it's playing out quite publicly among
outside experts.]{.underline}** In early November, Himes and four other
lawmakers sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and National
Security Adviser Susan Rice proposing a cyber convention like the Geneva
Convention, to lay out rules of the road for cyber.

"Now is the time for the international community to seriously respond
again with a binding set of international rules for cyberwarfare: an
E-Neva Convention," they wrote.

**[One key concern they have is what actually constitutes an act of war
in the digital realm, versus a smaller crime or nuisance. "What is cyber
war?" Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.), the chair of the House
Intelligence subcommittee on NSA and Cybersecurity who also signed the
letter, said in an interview. "What is it?"]{.underline}**

**["What if Iran melted down one server at Florida Power and Light? They
do \$5,000 worth of damage. That sounds to me like a crime," Himes said.
"But what if they melt down a whole bunch of servers, a network goes
down and a bunch of people die? That feels to me like an act of war." He
added: "But these lines aren't drawn. Because they\'re not drawn, is our
response to have the FBI investigate and file a diplomatic démarche? Or
is our response to do a cyber reprisal? Or is our response to do a
kinetic reprisal? We don\'t know. I think that\'s a real
problem."]{.underline}**

**[Another key question in the cyber realm is if any specific
infrastructure is off limits, the way hospitals are supposed to be
off-limits in kinetic war. Is an electrical grid a valid target?
Knocking out the Internet or the power can cause immense damage to
civilians, particularly in advanced countries like the United States
whose economies depend heavily on the Internet.]{.underline}**

[**Forging consensus on these questions is hard** but not
impossible]{.underline}. Already, [the international community is
coalescing around an agreement that states cannot conduct cyber
espionage for commercial purposes]{.underline}. Whether countries such
as China will actually abide by that is unclear, but countries have at
least agreed on that norm in principle.

**[Even among cyber experts, crafting a cohesive rules of engagement is
proving to be a challenge. "I don't know if you could come up with a set
policy," Westmoreland said. "I think it would have to be some type of
living document that would allow it to change when technology
changes."]{.underline}**

Daniel said that [coming out with a specific case-by-case framework was
not possible]{.underline}. \"The idea that we are going to be able to
spell out in detail exactly how we would respond to any particular
incident or activity, I think doesn't fully account for how we are going
to have to act in the real world,\" he said.

When I asked Himes how the U.S. government should craft a cyber strategy
if it can't prepare for every possible scenario, he responded: "The laws
of war, if you will, aren't about describing every possible scenario.
They are about articulating principles."

This top-level guidance needs to come not from cyber experts but from
elected leaders---and, observers say, so far that direction has not been
forthcoming.

"Part of the problem is that [there are so many **senior people in the
government**, **especially coming out of the political world**, that
**just don't understand enough about the technology**]{.underline},"
Borg said. "**[They really are remarkably uninformed.]{.underline}**"

You can see this in New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's comments about
cyber in the last Republican debate. "If the Chinese commit cyberwarfare
against us, they are going to see cyberwarfare like they have never seen
before," he said. Saber-rattling against the Chinese is nothing new for
a U.S. presidential election, but it's hard to imagine Christie making a
similar claim about conventional war.

In one sense, that's because it's hard to imagine Christie ever being
confronted with that scenario. No one is foreseeing an imminent kinetic
attack from China. But that's precisely what makes cyber so difficult:
What exactly would qualify as cyberwarfare? And what type of Chinese
cyber attack would result in "cyberwarfare like \[China has\] never seen
before"?

It seems superfluous to mention, perhaps, but cyberwar with China is war
with China. **[And a war that starts out in the cyber realm can quickly
migrate to other realms.]{.underline}**

**["I consider the current state of affairs to be extremely volatile and
unstable because one could escalate a cyberwar pretty quickly," said
Sami Saydjari, the founder of the Cyber Defense Agency consulting
firm,]{.underline}** who has been working on cyber issues for more than
three decades. "[You can imagine a scenario where a country instigates a
cyberwarfare-like event but does it in such a way to blame another
country, which causes an escalation between those countries, which
accidentally causes a kinetic escalation, which accidentally reaches the
nuclear level]{.underline}. This is not an implausible scenario."

Not implausible, but perhaps not likely either. At the moment, cyber
experts say, the world is at a tenuous moment of cyber peace. For all
the constant theft and hacking, nobody is waging overt attacks on
infrastructure and assets. But they also say this relative stability
masks the underlying threats in the cyber world.

"I would say [we're in a cold war, not a peace]{.underline}," Alexander
said. "[If you paint a picture of the world above, people are shaking
hands. And then below the water, they're kicking like crazy. I think in
cyber **there's so much going on in cyber that it's invisible to most
people**]{.underline}."

**[If a major cyber incident occurred in the U.S.---one that actually
hurt or even killed Americans---the public would quickly want some
answers, and likely a plan for defense and retaliation. In the absence
of more specific rules of engagement, it's clear to many experts what's
going to happen at this point: We're going to improvise.]{.underline}**

"[If there were a cyber incident in the United States, we'd do it from
scratch]{.underline}," said Martin Libicki, a senior scientist and
cyberwarfare expert at the RAND Corporation. "I don\'t care what\'s been
written. That\'s just the nature of the beast."

framework of strong political oversight."]{.underline}** **[The newly
updated White House National Cyber Strategy likewise envisions working
together with a "coalition of like-minded states" to "ensure adversaries
understand the consequences of their malicious cyber
behavior."]{.underline}**

**[Therein lies the rub. Both formal alliances, such as
NATO,]{.underline}** and more ad hoc arrangements, such as what the
Cyber Deterrence Initiative imagines, **[will require members to share
intelligence and eventually, to the best of their ability and perhaps in
different domains, contribute to joint action against a presumably
well-armed foreign aggressor. States]{.underline}** including the United
States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Estonia, and Denmark
**[have publicly declared their willingness to lend sovereign offensive
cyber effects to deter, defend against and counter the full spectrum of
threats.]{.underline}**

**[Sharing intelligence and information is a key element of NATO's core
decision-making]{.underline}** process enshrined in Article 4 of the
Washington Treaty. **[Political consultations]{.underline}** are part of
the preventive diplomacy between member states, but they
**[are]{.underline}** also **[an avenue to discuss concerns related to
the security threats member states face]{.underline}**. These
consultations can be a catalyst for reaching a consensus on policies to
be adopted or actions to be taken---including those on the use of
sovereign cyber effects to support a NATO operation.

The alliance has a track record of collective action and cooperative
security measures. For example, Operation Active Endeavour helped to
deter, disrupt and protect against terrorist activity in the
Mediterranean in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in
solidarity with the United States. For the seventh time, the Atlantic
Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative will be among the organizations
privileged to organize an event on the sidelines of the Feb. 15--17
Munich Security Conference. This year in particular, the Atlantic
Council's event, "Defending Human Dignity: Limiting Malicious Cyber
Activity Through Diplomacy," will complement the topics high on the
agenda of the main conference, such as transatlantic collaboration, the
consequences of a resurgence of great power competition and the future
of arms control.

In the United States, the greatest failures of response and deterrence
to foreign aggression in cyberspace have not been caused by a lack of
intelligence, capability or imagination. Rather, **[U.S. policy has been
serviceable in theory but impotent in practice because of an inability
to translate technical findings and intelligence into public support for
sufficiently tough responses ordered by elected political leaders. North
Korea's repeated operations targeting U.S. companies and critical
infrastructure have been met with public skepticism over their
culpability, limiting the strength of retaliatory options needed to
deter further events. Chinese cyber economic espionage continued for
years despite widespread knowledge of China's activities because
political leaders found it difficult to confront Beijing without
undermining U.S. companies in return. Russian information operations did
not sow enough doubt to mislead experts, but they succeeded in
exacerbating the partisan polarization of an already-divided electorate
and its leaders.]{.underline}**

**[That inability to translate the findings of cyber experts into public
sentiment and therefore political action has sidelined America's
cyberwarriors, by far the most technologically advanced and
well-resourced in the world. Imagine the political response of an ally
that is asked to burden-share in response to cyber aggression but is
probably much closer to any resulting kinetic fight than the United
States.]{.underline}**

**[Now imagine the response of that ally when it's being asked to take
causus belli on faith: The United States is presenting attribution for a
cyberattack elsewhere in the world, but perhaps is depending on the ally
lacking critical details due to classification, and is presenting that
information alongside a request for help that might well put the ally in
the crosshairs of its own cyberattack or lethal action. How can allies
with different capabilities to collect, analyze and understand
intelligence be part of a consensus on using sovereign cyber effects to
support a NATO operation?]{.underline}** How can a commander achieve a
common operational picture to authorize the use of sovereign effects in
a NATO operation if all the allies are not on the same page with respect
to critical attribution and other technical information needed for a use
of effect in an operation? We all know what a tank looks like on a
shared satellite image, but if you ask three cyber experts to interpret
the attribution for a set of indicators, you are likely to get at least
four answers.

For most U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere, there is simply a dearth
of technical know-how within the government when it comes to cyber
attribution and operations. This is already a challenge for the United
States, with a massive defense budget, Silicon Valley innovation and an
educated workforce to pull into government service. But for many U.S.
allies, tech-savvy public servants will have long fled for the private
sector, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and academia before
reaching ministerial positions.

To its credit, the U.S. National Cyber Strategy does propose
capacity-building measures to support allies. This means building up law
enforcement, intelligence, and military operational and investigative
capability. But even with successful capacity-building programs, **[many
nations could]{.underline}**, in a crisis, end **[up in the same place
the United States is---with good options stuck on the shelf while
political leaders and their electorates lack a critical mass of informed
voters to trust, understand and act on expert findings.]{.underline}**

For countries weighing whether to risk their own blood and treasure in
support of an ally's cyber attribution findings, this hurdle could well
prove insurmountable if not addressed well before a crisis emerges. Many
such countries will no doubt recall being burned when placing too much
confidence in U.S. technical and human sources without an ability to
evaluate the evidence for themselves, as with the Iraq weapons of mass
destruction findings.

The private sector will probably play a crucial role in providing
intelligence to support alliance responses to cyberattacks, especially
as a stopgap over the next few years. FireEye and its peer competitors
and partners regularly produce analyses of major world cyber
events---many that fly below the radar of Western leadership, in
fact---sometimes at a near-government quality and often covering much of
the same "classified" evidence.

More important, private-sector analysts are accustomed to writing for
impact with both their technical counterparts, like chief information
security officers (CISOs) and threat hunters, and nontechnical
stakeholders such as boards of directors, CEOs and other persons
controlling the purse strings. In this sense, unclassified,
private-sector and NGO-driven cyber threat intelligence can become the
lingua franca of discussions. Relying on commercial reporting generated
by international teams, rather than declassified government-generated
reports, both broadens the audience enough to make alliance discussions
feasible and mitigates against disparities in terminology across
national lines---the tendency of even closely integrated allies to
describe cyber "attack," "information operations," and attribution
findings with different implicit assumptions or implications.

Long-Term Thinking In the long run, though, **[the U.S.
and]{.underline}** its more technologically advanced
**[allies]{.underline}**---such as its fellow Five Eyes (Australia,
Canada, New Zealand and the U.K.), France and Japan---[**will have to
make important policy changes in the interests of furthering alliance
cooperation in cyberspace: a willingness to sometimes risk sensitive
sources and methods in order to get cyber threat intelligence into the
hands of other countries better positioned to take policy action, an end
to classifying public information like IP addresses solely because of
their acquisition via classified means, and greater transparency on
their own decision-making.**]{.underline}

### Link -- Cyber -- GOP

#### The GOP will push back on increased funding for cyber security and anything that targets industry or election disinformation but will continue bipartisan cooperation

CHANGING OF THE GUARD --- [**Cybersecurity is poised to become a
significantly more confrontational issue if Republicans**]{.underline}
take power on Capitol Hill in this fall's midterm elections,
**[especially with the retirements of the moderate GOP ranking members
of both homeland security committees.]{.underline}**

As Eric reports in a story out this morning for Pros, **[newly empowered
Republicans would likely closely scrutinize critical infrastructure
regulations from CISA, the SEC, the TSA and other agencies for signs
that they're overly burdensome to industry, push back on continued
increases in CISA's budget as part of their overall debt-and-deficit
messaging, and cast a skeptical eye on election security activities,
especially efforts to combat right-wing election-fraud
disinformation.]{.underline}**

Rep. John **[Katko (N.Y.), the retiring House Homeland Security ranking
member who's supported two CISA budget increases and its election
security work, said he expects Republicans to pursue "some battles that
I wouldn't engage in]{.underline}** ... if very conservative people get

[**Americans have become increasingly skeptical of the
media**]{.underline} since the 1970s (Lee and Hosam 2020; Tsfati and
Cohen 2012). [**Many question the credibility of sources, citing
partisan slant or network profits for their distrust**
(]{.underline}Ladd 2012; Lee and Hosam 2020). **[Media distrust
increasingly echoes political divides, with self-described Democrats
trusting network news, NPR, and the New York Times, whereas most
Republicans trust only Fox News]{.underline}** (Jurkowitz et al. 2020;
Stroud 2011). [Additionally, **"differences in trust and distrust of
news outlets \[are\] often wider among the ideological wings of each
party---conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats"**]{.underline}
(Jurkowitz et al. 2020:22).

Yet when the novel coronavirus outbreak began in the United States,
millions of Americans turned to media coverage of the pandemic, seeking
answers and reassurance. In March 2020, the week after former President
Donald Trump declared a national emergency, cable news viewership
increased exponentially: CNN viewership jumped 193 percent, MSNBC
increased by 56 percent, and Fox experienced an 89 percent climb in
ratings (Bond 2020). Nielsen found that individuals in the United States
spent 215 percent more time reading news online than they had during the
same month of 2019 (Oxford Business Group 2020). Social media use also
increased, with a Harris Poll survey conducted between late March and
early May showing that between 46 percent and 51 percent of U.S. adults
were using social media more since the outbreak began (Harris Poll
2020); the New York Times reported that Facebook use was up 27 percent
and YouTube visits were up 15.3 percent (Koeze and Popper 2020). Indeed,
as noted by the Pew Foundation, early in the pandemic, Americans were
more positive than negative about COVID-19 news coverage (Gottfried,
Walker, and Mitchell 2020).

In light of this increase of media use, how has COVID-19 affected the
perceptions of low-income, liberal adults regarding the media? Focusing
on New York City, an early epicenter of the virus in the United States,
we ask, how has the lived experience of residents in New York affected
respondents' opinions of the media during a rapidly changing public
health crisis? Did increased media use during these unsettled times
(Swidler 1986) build trust?

In this article, we draw on surveys and in-depth remote interviews
conducted from April 2020 through June 2020 with nearly 200 gig and
precarious workers. Contrary to work by Gauchat (2012) and Evans and
Hargittai (2020) suggesting that conservatives and moderates are
"collectively different" from liberals and Democrats, we find that
left-leaning or liberal-identified participants also complained of media
sensationalism, fake news, and conflicting narratives in COVID-19
coverage. Additionally, although Shepherd, MacKendrick and Mora (2020)
found that existing political polarization and attitudes about Trump
affected the public's understanding of COVID-19, our in-depth interviews
suggest that these perspectives may be more nuanced than survey research
has previously found.

We draw upon Swidler's (1986) theory of strategic cultural action to
conceptualize liberal respondent's claims of "fake news." We argue that
the pandemic constitutes "unsettled times," in which social reality is
actively undergoing transformation (Swidler 1986:279). Grappling with
conflicting reports on the source of the virus, how it spreads, and how
to protect themselves and loved ones (Sanger et al. 2020), respondents
repurposed a readily available cultural tool: claims of "fake news." As
a result, these unsettled times have resulted in a "diffusion of
distrust," in which an elite conservative discourse of skepticism toward
the media has become a popular form of compensatory control (Kay et al.
2009) used by conservatives and liberals alike to make sense of the
contradictory, continuous coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, perceiving media sensationalism and "fake news" as "not
good" for their mental health, respondents reported experiencing media
burnout and physical and emotional responses to media that resulted in a
withdrawal from media consumption. Given the importance of an informed
electorate, we suggest that this media withdrawal may have long-term
consequences for American democracy and that postpandemic media coverage
will require a rebuilding of trust with members of the American public
across the political landscape. In the following section, we outline the
theoretical premise of our article within the literature on media
distrust, populism, and prevailing cultural logic.

Theoretical Framing

Distrust of Media and Expertise

**[Americans have grown increasingly distrustful of news media over the
past 40 years]{.underline}** (Jurkowitz et al. 2020; Ladd 2012).
**[Distrust in media has spread as confidence in other institutions and
in the impartiality of science has dwindled]{.underline}** (Citrin and
Stoker 2018; Evans and Hargittai 2020). Prior research has cast these
anti-institutional trends in terms of populist backlash against racial
minorities and elites (Bonikowski and Gidron 2016; Mudde 2004), but the
prevalence of this distrust suggests the need for additional
explanation. Following World War II, Western democracies increasingly
relied on a technocratic discourse of expertise to legitimate government
policies (Eyal 2019; Mudge 2018), replacing religious, moral, and legal
justifications with apolitical appeals to technical knowledge (Ezrahi
2004:254). Although scientific authority initially lent these
governments a sheen of credibility, the reduction of politics to expert
management eroded democratic responsiveness by isolating policy making
from popular will (Mounk 2018).

**[A crowded field of political actors claiming expertise further
undermined public confidence. Competitive pressures, disciplinary
specialization, and the complexity of socioeconomic forecasting led a
glut of experts to assert contradictory claims that appeared
increasingly arbitrary and politically biased]{.underline}**, a dynamic
Eyal (2019) neatly summarized: "The 'scientization of politics'
inadvertently causes the 'politicization of science'" [(p. 97).
**Ultimately, public perception of expertise as self-interested has
shaken the credibility of institutions ranging from government to
science and mass media**]{.underline} (Antonio 2000; Beck 1992).

**Disinfo playbook ensures the plan will provoke debate -- with
villainization, ensuring resources spent defending the plan, and high
risk fight undermines efficacy of the plan**

**Lorenz,  Washington Post Technology Columnist, 22** 

(Taylor, 5-18-2022, The Washington Post, \"How the Biden administration
let right-wing attacks derail its disinformation
efforts\", https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/18/disinformation-board-dhs-nina-jankowicz/, accessed
on 7-13-2022, SR)

**[Experts say that right-wing disinformation and smear campaigns
regularly follow the same playbook and that it's crucial that the public
and leaders of institutions, especially in the government, the media and
educational bodies, understand more fully how these cycles
operate.]{.underline}**

**[The campaigns invariably start with identifying a person to
characterize as a villain.]{.underline}** Attacking faceless
institutions is difficult, so **[a figurehead]{.underline}** (almost
always a woman or person of color) **[is found to serve as its
face.]{.underline}** Whether that person has actual power within that
institution is often immaterial. **[By discrediting those made to
represent institutions they seek to bring down, they discredit the
institution itself.]{.underline}**

**[Harassment and reputational harm is core to the attack
strategy.]{.underline}** Institutions often treat reputational harm and
online attacks as a personnel matter, one that unlucky employees should
simply endure quietly.

**[Jankowicz's case is a perfect example of this system at work,
said]{.underline}** Emerson T. **[Brooking, a resident senior fellow at
the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. "They try to
define people by these single, decontextualized moments," Brooking said.
"In Nina's case it's a few TikTok videos, or one or two comments out of
thousands of public appearances. They fixate on these small instances
and they define this villain."]{.underline}**

**[The worst thing any institution can do in the face of such attacks is
remain quiet, several disinformation researchers said.]{.underline}**

**["You never want to be silent, because then the people putting out the
disinformation own the narrative," said]{.underline}** Mark **[Jacobson,
assistant dean at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship
and Public Affairs, who has researched propaganda, political warfare and
disinformation for over 30 years. "You need to have a factual and
equally emotional counternarrative. A fact sheet is not a
narrative."]{.underline}**

**[Not responding with a highly compelling counternarrative, or not
getting out ahead of these campaigns to begin with, Jacobson explained,
can "give them an air of legitimacy."]{.underline}** He said he was
frustrated by the Biden administration's lack of a loud and vocal
response to what Jankowicz was going through. "Saying it's amateur hour
is cliche, but it's amateur hour," he said of the administration's
inaction.

**[The fallout from the campaign against Jankowicz can be seen in the
escalating attacks.]{.underline}** Violent threats against her are
flourishing online, according to Advance Democracy. Users on far-right
social media platforms continue to use misogynistic and bigoted language
in posts about Jankowicz, with many users calling for violence.

In response to one post on Gab featuring a video of Tucker Carlson
discussing Jankowicz, users commented: "Time to kill them all." Another
post featuring Carlson's coverage of Jankowicz was shared to a
right-wing forum with the caption "This is the point where we have to
draw the line." Comments said Jankowicz should be "greeted with Mr. 12
Gauge Slugs." An April 30 post on Gab featuring a tweet by Rep. Lauren
Boebert (R-Colo.) telling her followers "this is the hill to die on"
sparked replies that were flooded with threats to Jankowicz's life.
"It'd be easier if we had a large group of trained assassins to take a
lot of the \[government\] bastards out first," one user wrote.

"The irony is that Nina's role was to come up with strategies for the
department to counter this type of campaign, and now they've just
succumbed to it themselves," said one Hill staffer with knowledge of the
situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not
authorized to speak on the issue. "They didn't even fight, they just
rolled over."

**[DHS staffers worried that the way Jankowicz's situation was
mishandled could hurt their ability to recruit talent at a time when
white nationalist violence is thriving and the midterm elections are
approaching.]{.underline}**

"We're going to need another Nina down the road," said one DHS staffer
who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not at liberty to
comment. "And anyone who takes that position is going to be vulnerable
to a disinformation campaign or attack."

#### No political appetite for the plan -- Congress doesn\'t want to regulate fake news on the account they might do it wrong 

**Shaban, BuzzFeed News Reporter, 16**

\[Hamza, 12-14-2016, Rep. Lieu Press Release, "No One In Congress Wants
To Regulate Fake News",
<https://lieu.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/no-one-congress-wants-regulate-fake-news>,
accessed on 7-9-2022, MG\]

[Despite the rampant conspiracies that were shared widely during the
presidential election and the subsequent uproar over fake news,
disinformation, and propaganda, Congress is highly unlikely to take
steps to regulate Facebook, even as the platform-titan presides over the
distribution of news.]{.underline}

["I don't think regulating them is the answer," Rep. Anna Eshoo told
BuzzFeed News. "Who is going to be sitting with a federal spyglass to
vet each word that comes off of a platform? That doesn\'t seem feasible
to me."]{.underline}

[Nearly half of American adults get news from Facebook. That figure
becomes somewhat more distressing paired with data that suggests people
who rely heavily on the social network for their news are prone to
getting duped. The Pope himself recently likened the consumption of fake
news to eating human waste.]{.underline}

"We have more and more of the population that believes that they are
reading news that is authentic and vetted, when it is the opposite,"
Eshoo said. "It's one thing to say that the New York Times reported
inaccurately, and they have to make good on it, but there isn't any such
thing on the internet."

[Eshoo, who cofounded the Congressional Internet Caucus, and represents
a tech-friendly stronghold outside of San Francisco, praised
communication platforms as tools that can serve democracy, even as she
acknowledged their capacity to mislead citizens.]{.underline}

[She added, "News and its viability is one of the sacred ingredients of
a democracy, it's not something to be toyed with. I don\'t think I have
the answer. I think I have a strong sense of what's
important."]{.underline}

[Following widespread criticism that Facebook, through complacency and a
social scheme that rewards sensationalist engagement-chasing, may have
influenced the election, CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the charges as
"pretty crazy." Days later he softened his stance to "extremely
unlikely," even as some employees within the company have challenged
Zuckerberg on this issue, forming an unofficial task force to examine
Facebook's role in promoting fake news.]{.underline}

["I absolutely believe Facebook should do more internally to regulate
fake news and point out fake news," Rep. Ted Lieu told BuzzFeed News. "I
also oppose any governmental efforts to make any private sector company
do that." He continued, "I'm a strong believer in the First Amendment
and I don't believe it's government's role to force companies to take
that action, although I would hope that companies do so."]{.underline}

[Lieu's comments echo those of legal experts, who see editorial and
procedural improvements to social platforms as the way forward, rather
than Congress imposing potentially unconstitutional remedies through new
laws.]{.underline}

["I don't think there is a way to regulate them in a way that's
consistent with the First Amendment," David Greene, the civil liberties
director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation told BuzzFeed News. "We
don't regulate the press in this country. Even if it were possible to
define fake news, there's still a lot of very strong First Amendment
protection for false speech."]{.underline}

[Unlike defamation or libel, malicious lies that harm individuals,
Greene said it would be difficult for Congress to shape a law that would
protect the public at large from published falsehoods, since no single
group or person could convincingly show they were harmed. "There has to
be some kind of recognized injury," he said, beyond the public feeling
misled.]{.underline}

[Online intermediaries like Facebook and Twitter, Youtube and Yelp, are
generally shielded from what users say on their networks. A provision in
existing law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,
gives internet platforms broad protections from liability stemming from
objectionable content. These web companies, which include both internet
service providers (like Comcast) and "interactive computer services"
(like Google) aren't considered publishers or speakers themselves, but
hosts of other people's expression. "If Facebook did not create the
content, then Facebook can bear no liability," Greene
explained.]{.underline}

[Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA and founder of the legal blog
Volokh Conspiracy, told BuzzFeed News that a law targeting the
publication of knowingly false statements of fact would not be a
"radical departure from American First Amendment traditions." The
danger, he said, would come from its implementation.]{.underline}

["In principle it sounds great not to have fake news, but the problem is
someone is going to have to figure out what's true and what's a lie," he
said. "Especially when it gets to political stories, or stories about
history, science, or current events, that somebody --- the government,
the prosecutor --- is going to have his own preconceptions and political
agendas."]{.underline}

["That's a perilous power to give to the government," he said. For
Volokh, a prohibition on fake news would chill free speech and
journalistic endeavours, since even true statements on controversial
topics might be punishable.]{.underline}

["I hope that social media platforms continue to work their algorithms
to give more weight and balance to stories coming from credible news
source," Rep. Katherine Clark told BuzzFeed News. But the bigger
challenge, she said, is the spread of misinformation coming from
President-elect Donald Trump, and those close to him.]{.underline}

**Proactive disinformation frameworks are torn apart by the far-right**

**Lorenz, Washington Post Technology Columnist, 22** 

(Taylor, 5-18-2022, The Washington Post, \"How the Biden administration
let right-wing attacks derail its disinformation
efforts\", https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/05/18/disinformation-board-dhs-nina-jankowicz/, accessed
on 7-13-2022, SR)

On the morning of April 27, [**the Department of Homeland Security
announced the creation of the first Disinformation Governance Board with
the stated goal to "coordinate countering misinformation related to
homeland security.**"]{.underline} The Biden administration tapped Nina
Jankowicz, a well-known figure in the field of fighting disinformation
and extremism, as the board's executive director.

[**In naming**]{.underline} the 33-year-old **[Jankowicz to run the
newly created board, the administration chose someone with extensive
experience in the field of disinformation, which has emerged as an
urgent and important issue.]{.underline}** The author of the books "How
to Be a Woman Online" and "How to Lose the Information War," her career
also featured stints at multiple nonpartisan think tanks and nonprofits
and included work that focused on strengthening democratic institutions.
Within the small community of disinformation researchers, her work was
well-regarded.

[**But within hours of news of her appointment, Jankowicz was thrust
into the spotlight by the very forces she dedicated her career to
combating. The board itself and DHS received criticism for both its
somewhat ominous name and scant details of specific
mission**]{.underline} (Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas
said it "could have done a better job of communicating what it is and
what it isn't"), [**but Jankowicz was on the receiving end of the
harshest attacks, with her role mischaracterized as she became a primary
target on the right-wing Internet**.]{.underline} She has been subject
to an unrelenting barrage of harassment and abuse while unchecked
misrepresentations of her work continue to go viral.

[Now, just three weeks after its announcement, the Disinformation
Governance Board is being "paused," according to multiple employees at
DHS]{.underline}, capping a back-and-forth week of decisions that
changed during the course of reporting of this story. [On Monday, DHS
decided to shut down the board,]{.underline} according to multiple
people with knowledge of the situation. [By Tuesday morning, Jankowicz
had drafted a resignation letter]{.underline} in response to the board's
dissolution.

But Tuesday night, Jankowicz was pulled into an urgent call with DHS
officials who gave her the choice to stay on, even as the department's
work was put on hold because of the backlash it faced, according to
multiple people with knowledge of the call. Working groups within DHS
focused on mis-, dis- and mal-information have been suspended. The board
could still be shut down pending a review from the Homeland Security
Advisory Council. On Wednesday morning, Jankowicz officially resigned
from her role within the department.

"Nina Jankowicz has been subjected to unjustified and vile personal
attacks and physical threats," a DHS spokesperson told The Washington
Post in a statement. "[In congressional hearings and in media
interviews, the Secretary has repeatedly defended her as eminently
qualified and underscored the importance of the Department's
disinformation work, and he will continue to do so.]{.underline}"

Jankowicz has not spoken publicly about her position since the day it
was announced.

[Jankowicz's experience is a prime example of how the right-wing
Internet apparatus operates,]{.underline} **[where far-right influencers
attempt to identify a target, present a narrative and then repeat
mischaracterizations across social media and websites with the aim of
discrediting and attacking anyone who seeks to challenge
them.]{.underline}** [It also shows what happens when institutions, when
confronted with these attacks, don't respond effectively.]{.underline}

Those familiar with the board's inner workings, including DHS employees
and Capitol Hill staffers, along with experts on disinformation, say
Jankowicz was set up to fail by an administration that was unsure of its
messaging and unprepared to counteract a coordinated online campaign
against her.

[Just hours after Jankowicz tweeted about her new job, far-right
influencer Jack Posobiec posted tweets accusing the Biden administration
of creating a "Ministry of Truth."]{.underline} Posobiec's 1.7 million
followers quickly sprung into action. By the end of the day, there were
at least 53,235 posts on Twitter mentioning "Disinformation Governance
Board," many referencing Jankowicz by name, according to a report by
Advance Democracy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that conducts
public-interest research. In the days following, that number
skyrocketed.

[The board was created to study best practices in combating the harmful
effects of disinformation and to help DHS counter viral lies and
propaganda that could threaten domestic security.]{.underline} Unlike
the "Ministry of Truth" in George Orwell's "1984" that became a
derogatory comparison point, neither the board nor Jankowicz had any
power or ability to declare what is true or false, or compel Internet
providers, social media platforms or public schools to take action
against certain types of speech. [In fact, the board itself had no power
or authority to make any operational decisions.]{.underline}

["The Board's purpose has been grossly mischaracterized; it will not
police speech," the DHS spokesperson said. "Quite the opposite, its
focus is to ensure that freedom of speech is protected."]{.underline}

**[Posobiec's early tweets shaped the narrative and Jankowicz was
positioned as the primary target. Republican lawmakers echoed Posobiec's
framing and amplified it to their audiences.]{.underline}** Missouri
Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who is a U.S. Senate hopeful, and Rep.
Andrew S. Clyde (R-Ga.) both posted tweets similar to Posobiec's. Former
congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) also posted a video repeating
Posobiec's statements.

**[The week following the announcement, approximately 70 percent of Fox
News's one-hour segments mentioned either Jankowicz or the board, with
correspondents frequently deriding the board as a "Ministry of Truth,"
according to Advance Democracy.]{.underline}** The Fox News coverage was
referenced in some of the most popular posts on Facebook and Twitter
criticizing Jankowicz.

**[Dozens of websites]{.underline}** including Breitbart, the Post
Millennial, the Daily Caller and the New York Post
**[began]{.underline}** **[mining Jankowicz's past social media posts
and publishing articles to generate controversy.]{.underline}** Some
were simply mocking, making fun of her for parodying a song from "Mary
Poppins" to talk about misinformation. In another instance, a
performance where Jankowicz sings a popular musical theater song about a
person's desire to become rich and powerful was misrepresented to imply
that Jankowicz herself was after money and power and would sleep with
men to get it.

**[As this online campaign played out, DHS and the Biden administration
struggled to counter the repeated attacks.]{.underline}**

The weekend after her hiring was announced, Mayorkas attempted to
clarify the board's mission and defended Jankowicz's credentials. He did
a round of TV news interviews and testified about the board during House
and Senate committee hearings. A forceful defense of Jankowicz was
noticeably absent online, where the attacks against her were
concentrated. White House press secretary Jen Psaki debunked false
claims about the board during two news briefings and touted Jankowicz as
"an expert on online disinformation," but it had little effect on the
growing campaign against her.

"These smears leveled by bad-faith, right-wing actors against a deeply
qualified expert and against efforts to better combat human smuggling
and domestic terrorism are disgusting," deputy White House press
secretary Andrew Bates told The Post on Tuesday.

As she endured the attacks, Jankowicz was told to stay silent. After
attempting to defend herself on Twitter April 27, she was told by DHS
officials to not issue any further public statements, according to
multiple people close to her.

Democratic lawmakers, legislative staff and other administration
employees who sought to defend Jankowicz were caught flat-footed.
Administration officials did not brief the relevant congressional staff
and committees ahead of the board's launch, and members of Congress who
had expressed interest in disinformation weren't given a detailed
explanation about how it would operate. A fact sheet released by DHS on
May 2 did nothing to quell the outrage that had been building on the
Internet, nor did it clarify much of what the board would actually be
doing or Jankowicz's role in it.

DHS staffers have also grown frustrated. With the department's
suspension of intra-departmental working groups focused on mis-, dis-
and mal-information, some officials said it was an overreaction that
gave too much credence to bad-faith actors. A 15-year veteran of the
department, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to comment publicly, called the DHS response to the
controversy "mind-boggling." "I've never seen the department react like
this before," he said.

### Link -- Biotech -- Reform

#### Biotech reform sparks debate -- multiple stakeholders will get involved and litigate every detail

**Servick, Science Staff Writer, 19** 

\[Kelly Servick, studied cognitive science and comparative literature at
the University of Georgia, graduate program at the University of
California, Santa Cruz, introduced her to science writing., 6-4-19,
Science, \"Controversial U.S. bill would lift Supreme Court ban on
patenting human genes\",
<https://www.science.org/content/article/controversial-us-bill-would-lift-supreme-court-ban-patenting-human-genes>,
accessed on 7-13-2022, MG\]

[**A congressional proposal that would overturn a**]{.underline}
landmark U.S. Supreme Court [**decision that barred the patenting of
human genes and ease other restrictions on patenting software and
biomedical inventions is drawing fierce criticism** **from some
scientific societies and patient advocates.**]{.underline} Yesterday,
**[the]{.underline}** American Civil Liberties Union
(**[ACLU]{.underline}**) in Washington, D.C., **[along with more than
100 other signatories from research institutes and advocacy groups,
released a letter to lawmakers arguing the changes would stifle medical
research and hinder patients\' access to diagnostic
tests.]{.underline}**

[**The draft bill \"would result in a quagmire of patent claims and
legal impediments to the normal scientific exchange,\"
said**]{.underline} Harold [**Varmus,**]{.underline} a cancer biologist
at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and **[former director of the
National Cancer Institute,]{.underline}** in a press conference
yesterday. \"It\'s in the interest of virtually everyone to keep ideas
and basic discoveries about the laws and products of nature in the
public domain.\"

The ACLU letter comes as the Senate Committee on the Judiciary kicks off
the first in a series of three hearings that will examine potential
changes to U.S. patent law. [**Today\'s hearing is expected to include
discussion of the draft**]{.underline} proposal, released last month by
a bipartisan group of lawmakers, **[which would overturn current
restrictions on patenting products and processes that occur in nature,
including human genes.]{.underline}**

[**The bill aims to address a complaint that has been brewing for years
in the biotechnology and software industries: that recent Supreme Court
decisions have created confusing and overly stringent patent eligibility
rules.**]{.underline} In particular, critics point to three recent
rulings:

The 2012 decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus
Laboratories invalidated a patent on adjusting drug dosage based on
levels of metabolites in a patient\'s blood because it relied on a \"law
of nature.\"

The landmark 2013 ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) v.
Myriad Genetics Inc. said that human genes can\'t be patented because
they are a \"product of nature.\"

In 2014, software patents took a blow from the Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank
International decision, which found a financial trading program to be an
unpatentable \"abstract idea.\"

The new bill \"makes it clear in no uncertain terms that all the Supreme
Court \[decisions\] are just gone,\" says Arti Rai, a patent law expert
at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. It says decisions about
patent eligibility should not rely on \"judicially created exceptions
... including 'abstract ideas,\' 'laws of nature,\' or 'natural
phenomena.\'\"

[**The bill\'s sponsors**]{.underline} in the Senate, Thom Tillis
(R--NC) and Chris Coons (D--DE), [**have described it as a way to
restore incentives for U.S. innovation by making the process for
protecting new inventions more predictable.** **(Competition with China,
where no comparable restrictions exist in the patent system, may have
motivated the lawmakers, Rai says.)**]{.underline}

**[But opponents say the bill would enable monopolies on discoveries
that should be widely available for research and medical
use.]{.underline}** In the 2013 Myriad case, the diagnostic company
Myriad Genetics of Salt Lake City claimed that its broad patents on two
human genes gave it exclusive rights to clinical tests for
cancer-associated mutations in those genes. In striking down the
patents, the Supreme Court allowed other diagnostic companies to offer
such tests without fear of infringement lawsuits. Signatories on the new
letter---including plaintiffs who challenged the Myriad patents, and
ACLU, which represented them---argue that if the proposed law is
enacted, \"We will again see high prices for tests with no competition
in the market.\"

But Rai notes that the scientific and business landscapes have changed
since Myriad. \"I don\'t think anyone is really trying to get single
gene patents anymore,\" she says. Patents that have already been struck
down can\'t be resurrected, she notes, and thanks to extensive research
on the human genome, many claims to individual genes would no longer be
considered \"novel,\" as U.S. patent law requires. \"If the information
is already out there---and most of the information about the human
genome at a single-gene level is already out there---you can\'t patent
it because it\'s no longer new.\"

Still, the proposed bill would also apply to patenting complex methods
of estimating a person\'s risk for disease based on a combination of
many genes---so-called polygenic risk scores. Some of these approaches
have already won patent protection, Rai says, though it\'s not clear
whether, under the current rules, the existing patents would hold up to
a challenge in court.

Even if the draft language gets enacted, the current law\'s requirement
of novelty---and other requirements untouched by the proposed
changes---would ensure that \"people won\'t be able to go totally
crazy\" in trying to patent discoveries based on nature, predicts Dan
Burk, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. But
adoption of the change could cause a surge of patent applications for
software, and potentially also for biotechnology and medical
diagnostics, he says. And even if most human genome sequences remain off
limits, previously unexplored genes from many other species---some
potentially useful to medicine---would newly become eligible for a
patent.

Burk, for one, doubts the exact language in the draft will be enacted,
but he does expect changes to the law. \"I am pretty confident,\" he
says, \"that if we have a conversation in 6 months to a year, the patent
statute will look different than it does today.\"

\*Update, 5 June, 11:30 a.m.: In the first of three patent reform
hearings, Senators Coons and Tillis said they didn\'t intend to upend
all restrictions on patenting human genes or other basic research
discoveries**[. \"Our proposal would not change the law to allow a
company to patent a gene as it exists in the human body,\" Coons said in
his opening statement. \"We do not intend to overrule that holding of
the 2013 Myriad decision.\"]{.underline}**

**[But the witnesses at the hearing had different interpretations of the
bill\'s text. The intent to preserve Myriad is \"inconsistent with the
legislative text that\'s been put forward,\" said patent policy
researcher Charles Duan of the R Street Institute in Washington, D.C.,
in his testimony]{.underline}**. **[The proposed language could make it
possible to patent many kinds of \"pure scientific research,\" he said.
\"I don\'t think that\'s the intent, but ... that\'s what the language
does.\"]{.underline}**

\"I think your proposal does overturn the Myriad decision, and I hope it
does,\" Sherry Knowles, an attorney at Knowles Intellectual Property
Strategies in Atlanta, told the Senators. The cancer drug adriamycin,
which she credited with her own remission from breast cancer, is a
compound first discovered in soil microbes, she noted, and it \"would
never have been developed ... without the patent framework we had before
Myriad.\" Since that decision, she said, \"There\'s been a dead stop in
research in the United States on isolated natural products.\"

### Link -- Biotech -- Regulation

#### Biotech regulations spark intense debate -- multiple stakeholders ensure the link, and generates uncertainty, turning the case

**Chakraborty, Kings College PhD in Risk Management, 17** 

\[Sweta Chakraborty, She is the Key Behavioral Scientist at Resilience
Action Partners and worked in the private sector as Chief Scientist for
a risk management-consulting firm, has taught at Columbia University as
an adjunct professor, 7-11-17, War Room - U.S. Army War College,
\"PROMISE AND PERIL: THE BIOTECH SECURITY DILEMMA\",
<https://warroom.armywarcollege.edu/articles/promise-peril-security-dilemma-biotechnology/>,
accessed on 7-13-2022, MG\]

[In addition to public engagement, measures towards increased
stakeholder transparency must address concerns over scientists "playing
God." If the public perceives that the academic and industrial research
communities are not accountable for their actions, then researchers will
be less likely to disclose intended uses of genetic engineering
technology, and may remove themselves entirely from the field. Thus, the
public relations stigma of biotech can impede the advance of crucial
biotechnology products, or limit the applications of existing
technology. The net effect can be similar to that of an outright ban,
regardless of whether the biotechnology has regulatory
approval]{.underline} (e.g., GM salmon). [In other words, without
effective public engagement and education, the U.S. can get the
regulations right and still have a crippled biotech research
capability.]{.underline}

[Biotech is a dual-use technology that has tremendous potential for both
good and bad. If used appropriately, it can dramatically improve the
human condition; but it also has the potential for more nefarious
outcomes.]{.underline}

[Stakeholder transparency and public engagement are not necessarily
panaceas for public acceptance. It is the duty of experts and elected
officials in democratic states to reduce the burden of technical
information and subsequent decision-making requirements for the lay
public. Instead of involving the public in potentially complex
risk-benefit analyses, public acceptance and challenges related to trust
and ethics can also be addressed through better communication efforts.
Robust methods developed from the field of cognitive behavioral
psychology have proven effective in addressing these types of challenges
and need to be more systematically applied to existing and emerging risk
perceptions associated with advancing biotechnologies.]{.underline}

[Public pushback can have incredible impact. Negative receptions to
biotechnology products can result in an overly cautious regulatory
approach to biotechnology that could harm the development of innovation
in lieu of other countries' facing fewer restrictions in pursuing
innovative and lucrative technologies. From this perspective, the major
threat to American national security is losing ground in terms of
science and technology innovation capacity to other nations. The Wilson
Center reports that the stakes in biosecurity are high, particularly in
regards to ownership of various genetic engineering innovations
(]{.underline}e.g., gene-editing patents[). Losing ownership at early
stage technology development can affect upstream knowledge-sharing and
collaboration, and can also result in the U.S. having a less competitive
edge in attracting research talent and private sector investment. To
protect against these outcomes and to achieve the immense potential of
genetically-engineered products, there must be acute regulatory efforts
to address public perceptions of risks and to encourage the private
sector and academia to continue innovating. Adapting ownership models
and incentivizing information-sharing for improved biotech research
collaborations is the best way to preserve security while maintaining
public safety.]{.underline}

[Biotech is a dual-use technology that has tremendous potential for both
good and bad. If used appropriately, it can dramatically improve the
human condition; but it also has the potential for more nefarious
outcomes, such as disrupting food supplies and sickening large
populations.]{.underline} Regardless[, continued advancements in
biotechnology are inevitable.]{.underline} We may wish for a world in
which food was so abundant and people were so healthy that nobody would
be interested in biotechnology[. We may also wish for a world in which
no one is interested in pursuing technologies with the potential to harm
others. But that is not the world we inhabit. The current abundance of
food is no guarantee against future scarcity, especially when we
consider the risks of climate change. Human beings remain intensely
interested in devising new ways to hurt each other. The U.S. cannot
afford to absent itself from an area of research with such dire security
implications. The combination of progress and prudence is the best that
we can do.]{.underline}

### Link Booster -- Econ Key

#### Economic issues are top public concern

Accessed 7-9-2022, LASA-LR\]

**[Economic issues topped the list of things that voters are concerned
about, according to a new Politico-Morning Consult poll.]{.underline}**

**[Forty-one percent of registered voters polled said economic issues,
including wages and taxes, are their top set of issues as they cast
their vote for federal offices.]{.underline}** Thirteen percent said
security was their top issue, while another 11 percent each named
seniors and women's issues.

With the midterm elections less than six months away, voters indicated a
slight preference toward voting for Democrats in this year's
congressional elections**[. Forty-five percent of respondents said they
would vote for the Democratic candidate compared to 41 percent favoring
a Republican candidate.]{.underline}**

**[But Democrats, who are fighting to save their ultra-narrow majorities
in the House and Senate this year, have struggled to combat Republican
messaging on economic issues as the country continues to face the
highest rate of inflation in decades]{.underline}**. Consumer prices
climbed 8.3 percent in April compared with a year earlier, marking the
fastest increase in roughly 40 years.

**[Because Congress confers legitimacy and because its members
are]{.underline}** (on balance) **[less active on foreign policy, the
legislative branch has a disproportionate impact when it does act. The
executive branch and foreign governments pay close attention to what
Congress does, which gives members a unique tool for shaping these
stakeholders' agendas]{.underline}**.127 Notably, **[interviewees
generally agreed that Congress can have this sort of impact on the
executive branch and allies even through low-cost actions like informal
conversations with foreign diplomats or statements to the press.
Congress' ability to directly influence foreign
governments,]{.underline}** in particular, **[is]{.underline}** an
interesting finding of this project and **[an important exception to the
overall reality that the legislative branch is less influential than the
executive on foreign policy]{.underline}**

## Internal Links

### Internal Link -- Dems Key

#### No bipartisanship likely -- Dems are key

**Shephard, The New Republic, 22**

\[Alex Shephard, 1-21-2022, New Republic, \"Bipartisanship Is Dead, and
That's Great News for Joe Biden,\",
https://newrepublic.com/article/165093/bipartisanship-dead-biden-democrats-obama,
Accessed 7-11-2022, LASA-LR\]

**[Biden got lucky once on this score: Bipartisanship produced a flawed
infrastructure bill that, to this point, may represent the
administration's most important legislative victory]{.underline}**.
**[But the handful of Republicans who had something to gain from
appearing "bipartisan" have already gotten their reward; they have no
interest in aiding this administration any further, especially with the
midterm---and then the presidential---elections rapidly
approaching.]{.underline}**

**[This, of course, also means that Biden is stuck with the
pamphlet-thin Democratic margins he has in Congress---and with at least
two senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who have proven to be just
as committed to stymying his agenda as their Republican
counterparts.]{.underline}** But the first step in recovery is admitting
you have a problem, and acknowledging the failure of bipartisanship is
crucial to righting an administration that has, in recent months, gone
badly off the rails. It wasn't until his second term that Obama fully
reckoned with this reality. Biden got there faster. Perhaps that will
count for something; for now, it will have to do.

## Impacts

### Antitrust Reform Good -- Now Key

#### Now is key -- failure to pass antitrust before the break risks collapse of reform

**Reardon, CNET senior reporter, 7-1-22**

\[Marguerite, 7-1-22, CNET, "Congress\' Bid to Rein In Big Tech Needs a
Push Over the Finish Line",
<https://www.cnet.com/news/politics/congress-bid-to-rein-in-big-tech-needs-a-push-over-the-finish-line/>,
accessed 7-4-22, AFB\]

**[It\'s getting down to the wire for Congress to pass]{.underline}** a
**[long-awaited]{.underline}** federal privacy law and **[antitrust
reform that could help change how Big Tech companies]{.underline}** like
Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta **[do business.]{.underline}**

**[Congress is considering a slate of bills on both the privacy and
antitrust fronts, which could result in, for the first time, regulation
for major internet technology companies in the US. But even though there
is bipartisan support for the legislation in the House and Senate, these
bills still face uphill battles in their final push. While negotiations
are ongoing, time is running out]{.underline}** as Democrats risk losing
control of both the House and Senate come the midterm elections in
November. **[While the legislation could be taken up in the next
Congress, experts fear that legislative priorities are likely to shift
and further delay would likely result in a chipping away of key aspects
of both antitrust and privacy legislation.]{.underline}**

**[The next six weeks before the summer recess of Congress are
\"vital,\" said]{.underline}** Bill **[Kovacic, former chair of the
Federal Trade Commission and now a professor at George Washington
University School of Law.]{.underline}**

**[\"The hazard is that you\'re coming out of this year with nothing,\"
he said. \"They could try again in the next Congress, but it\'s much
more of a gamble. The prospects for robust legislation for privacy or
for the regulation of digital platforms diminishes
greatly.\"]{.underline}**

This all comes after nearly five years of lawmakers on both sides of the
aisle promising to rein in the power and influence of Big Tech with very
little to show for their efforts so far. Increasingly alarmed by the
power that giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Twitter wield,
they\'ve targeted how these companies harm consumers by allegedly
choking competition from smaller players, exploiting personal data for
profit or controlling what is shared and consumed online.

#### Now is key -- failure to pass antitrust reform will embolden anticompetitive behaviors

**[Two pieces of antitrust legislation are teed up for Senate votes. If
passed and signed into law, the legislation would mark the most
meaningful change to antitrust law in decades. The stakes are high,

Rhode Island **[who chairs the House Judiciary subcommittee on
antitrust, said]{.underline}** during a webinar on antitrust Thursday.
**[The big tech companies have already proven that they will behave
badly without changes to the law and strict antitrust law enforcement,
he contends.]{.underline}**

**[\"If we aren\'t successful in prohibiting the most pernicious
behavior of these companies, they\'re going to be emboldened,\" he said.
\"Their conduct is going to get worse,\" which, he added, will \"crush
innovation\" and leave less competition and fewer choices for
consumers.]{.underline}**

**[The American Innovation and Choice Online Act,]{.underline}** which
was introduced last October by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from
Minnesota, and Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, **[would ban
companies from preferencing their own products on their platforms over
those of their competitors.]{.underline}** It would end, for instance,
Google\'s practice of highlighting its own products in search results
over its competitors\' sites and services. It would also prohibit Amazon
from listing its own products on its e-commerce site at the top of its
page before products sold from third-party competitors.

The Open App Markets Act, introduced in February by Sens. Richard
Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, and Marsha Blackburn, a
Republican from Tennessee, would prohibit companies, namely Apple or
Google, from requiring app developers to pay app store commissions when
their customers make in-app purchases. Currently, Apple and Google,
which essentially control the app market, require all apps that allow
in-app purchases to use their payment processors and to pay a commission
on sales.

**[Both bills have been passed by the House on a bipartisan basis. The
legislation also passed through committee earlier this year with strong
bipartisan support, but senators from both parties say they still have
concerns to be hammered out before a floor vote.]{.underline}**

### Econ Issues Hurt Biden Now

**Economic issues hurting Biden now**

Political Correspondent, 7-11-22** (Mychael and Hanna, 7-11-22, The

The midterm **[election doomsday]{.underline}** scenario **[for
Democrats is becoming clearer, scarier, and more real as inflation and
gas prices remain stubbornly high and dissatisfaction with President
Biden is through the roof.]{.underline}**

Democrats are seeing their chances of retaining the House slimmer than
ever, with both history and the dreary political environment working
against them. In the Senate, where the party had hoped strong swing
state candidates could help save the majority, fears are also growing.

**[It seems that wherever voters look, things are bad in Biden's
Washington --- and getting worse.]{.underline}**

"**[Democrats haven't done things they promised," said]{.underline}**
Connor **[Farrell, a strategist who founded the progressive consultancy
Left Rising.]{.underline}** "In this environment, the best general
election candidates will be bold \[ones\] that can distinguish
themselves from what we're getting from the White House."

**[The high national anxiety --- which many lawmakers, operatives, and
activists are now openly acknowledging as problematic --- was further
laid bare when a poll released by the New York Times found that just 13
percent of voters surveyed think the country is on the right
path.]{.underline}** More strikingly, **[64 percent of Democratic voters
want someone other than Biden as their nominee in 2024.]{.underline}**

**[The high prices of daily essentials, a gloomy appraisal of what's
happening around the country, and the prospect of more impending losses
are leaving Democrats more concerned than ever]{.underline}** about
their odds in November.

"Democratic leadership should look no further than the fact that they
need to wake up and step up to the plate," said Jon Reinish, managing
director at the political strategy firm Mercury.

While the idea that Democrats need to brace for a potential fall wipeout
is not new, Monday's poll highlights a trend that many see as
particularly damning --- **[a majority of registered Democratic voters
are not happy with the overall direction of the U.S. under Biden's
leadership and they are not on board with another four years of
it.]{.underline}**

**[Sixty-three percent of Democrats polled said the country is headed in
the wrong direction, while only 27 percent said it is on the right
track.]{.underline}**

"They're not just losing Independents or you know, Never-Trump
Republicans," said Reinish, referencing two blocs that helped Biden
establish a diverse coalition in 2020. "They're losing their own voters.
Democrats' own voters don't feel as if their leaders hear their
concerns."

That mindset is adding to what many already fear is an uphill midterm
battle. A Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted last month did,
however, find that registered voters are evenly split on the generic
congressional ballot if the election were held that day.

But the party does not appear concerned, arguing that Biden's waning
approval will not jeopardize down-ballot candidates.

### Biden Weak Now

#### Biden can\'t do anything right now, his authority is gone

**Nicholas, NBC News political reporter, 7-5-22**

\[Peter, 7-5-22, NBC News, \"With pressures mounting, Biden thinks GOP
will make his midterm case for him\",
<https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/pressures-mounting-biden-thinks-gop-will-make-midterm-case-rcna36514>,
accessed on 7-9-22, MG\]

[Little is going President Joe Biden's way as the summer lull sets in
before the crush of midterm elections.]{.underline}

[Gas prices are up; his approval rating is down. A conservative Supreme
Court majority is hacking away at his agenda by abolishing federal
abortion rights and undermining environmental protections meant to curb
climate change. His own party is losing patience, fearing that any
chance of consequential change while Democrats control Congress is
vanishing.]{.underline}

"There needs to be urgency and action," said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, who
was an aide to the late Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. "Folks have
been saying since the day Joe Biden was elected that we need to move
fast. There are a lot of things we need to get done for the American
people."

[Biden has been rolling out plans to cope with the mounting crises. He
has a three-part plan to reduce inflation. Another plan to suspend the
gas tax in hopes of bringing prices down. Then there's his long-shot
plan to enshrine abortion rights into law by suspending the Senate
filibuster rule requiring 60-vote supermajorities.]{.underline}

[Inside the White House, though, advisers grasp that what's required
aren't just plans, but votes. The 50-50 split in the Senate between the
parties has proved an insurmountable obstacle for Biden's grandest
ambitions --- to expand the social safety net in ways that insulate the
most vulnerable Americans from economic shocks.]{.underline}

["He has to change course," said a Democratic congressman, speaking on
condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting the White House. "His
numbers are in the toilet. Whatever he's doing is not
working."]{.underline}

[A perennial complaint from Biden's Democratic critics is that he hasn't
capitalized on the platform he commands as president.]{.underline}

["There's a benefit to having the president out there every day using
his executive power to show the country you're fighting for them," the
Democratic lawmaker said. "And it's almost like he's hiding. He has the
bully pulpit, and he's either hiding behind it or under it. I don't know
where he is."]{.underline}

### Uniqueness & Internal Link Answer

#### No unique link or internal link -- Biden getting terrible media coverage now -- so did Reagan -- and he will bounce back

**Waldman, Washington Post Plum Line Writer, 22** 

(Paul, 7-12-22, The Washington Post, \"Joe Biden's bad news
problem\", https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/07/12/biden-bad-news-problem/, accessed
on 7-13-22, SR)

**[If you want to understand President Biden's troubles, just look at
all the news about gas prices.]{.underline}**

**[Or to be more specific, look at the lack of media coverage, now that
gas prices are falling precipitously, dropping 35 cents just in the last
month.]{.underline}** Yet the news does not lead every night with
stories in which producers scour the country for the least expensive gas
so they can put up one picture after another of signs showing how low
the price has gotten.

**[Biden had very little to do with that price decline, just as he had
very little to do with the increase that preceded it. Yet the increase
was given maximum attention, with lots of discussion of how it would
hurt him; the decline is essentially ignored.]{.underline}**

**[It's just one example that shows how the political and media system
in which we all reside is built to make every president look like a
failure --- right up until they win reelection]{.underline}**.

**[Right now Biden is in an approval trough, one many prior presidents
experienced around the same time.]{.underline}** The initial honeymoon,
driven by all the hope and possibility of a new era, wears off once the
difficult work of governing begins.

Legislative successes may come in the first year of a presidency, but
then they get harder to come by. [The president's supporters, realizing
he's unable to wave a wand and bring about the paradise he promised
during the campaign, begin to feel dissatisfied. **Since almost every
president sees their party suffer a brutal midterm loss, the news is
full of discussion of his coming defeat.**]{.underline}

**[Perhaps most importantly, bad news is always treated as more
important than good news, so everything that is bad for the president
gets amplified. That applies to gas prices and inflation, and it applies
to the president himself: A new poll showing him with surprisingly high
approval ratings will get a fraction of the coverage of one showing him
with surprisingly low approval.]{.underline}**

**[So you probably saw extensive media coverage of a New York Times poll
that came out Monday, showing a majority of Democrats saying they want
another presidential nominee in 2024. While no one would say it doesn't
show weakness for Biden, it's an old story; here's an article in The
Post from September of 1982 about a poll showing a majority of voters
saying Ronald Reagan shouldn't run again in 1984. You may remember how
that election turned out.]{.underline}**

**[It's a good reminder of how presidential approval tends to ebb and
flow.]{.underline}** Obviously, real-world events make a big difference,
whether it's the economy or foreign crises or natural disasters. But
what we often see is that after the first midterm defeat, presidents
slowly recover the public's esteem, and everything changes once the
public is presented with a binary choice between the president and a
challenger.

That isn't to deny Biden could have done plenty of things better. Like
other liberals, I've been critical of some of his choices and his
handling of a number of issues. I worry that he has been unable to
manage his party's base to keep them engaged and energized. And there
are legitimate questions about his age (he'd be 86 at the end of his
second term).

But we should also be careful when we discern a causal connection
between whatever substantive or stylistic critique we have of the
president and his low approval ratings.

Here's an example: [One criticism Biden's supporters make is that he can
be too downbeat, that to demonstrate sympathy with people's struggles
only reinforces the idea that things are bad.]{.underline} It's a
reasonable point, but it's also sometimes accompanied by the observation
that if Donald Trump were in the same situation, he'd say that even the
most incremental improvement anywhere is the greatest thing that ever
happened in world history and we should all be down on our knees
thanking him.

[Whenever there's a good jobs report or even a decline in gas prices,
some liberals will say, "If this was Trump he'd be on the news taking
credit for it!"]{.underline} Which indeed he would. [But people often
forget that it didn't actually work.]{.underline}

[Trump never convinced most Americans he was doing a great job; he was
the only president in the history of polling never to crack 50 percent
approval, not even for a single day. His party was blown out in the 2018
midterms, and then he lost his reelection bid.]{.underline}

You may believe that in a just and rational world, Trump's approval
would have never been higher than 5 or 10 percent, but even so, all his
preening and bragging clearly failed. And while it might not hurt for
Biden to have a more relentlessly positive message, there isn't much
reason to think doing so would have an enormous effect on how voters
think of him.

**[None of this means Biden is a secret political genius. But other
presidents --- Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama --- found
themselves in similar situations and recovered to win reelection and
leave office in the glow of public affection. The same could happen to
Biden, and the good news for him is that if there's a story the media
loves almost as much as the one that says everything is terrible, it's
the one about a dramatic comeback.]{.underline}**

## Link Answers

### No Unique Link -- Fights About Ukraine Aid Now

#### 

#### No link - Pelosi is threatening bipartisan support for Ukraine by linking aid to COVID politics

**Thiessen, The Washington Post Foreign and Domestic Policy Columnist,
22 **

(Marc A., 5-3-2022, The Washington Post, \"Pelosi's partisan politics on
Ukraine could have deadly
consequences\", https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/05/03/pelosi-kyiv-trip-playing-partisan-politics-on-ukraine/, accessed
on 7-13-2022, SR)

House Speaker Nancy **[Pelosi]{.underline}** (D-Calif.) **[deserves
credit for leading a congressional delegation to Kyiv to meet with
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky]{.underline}** --- a trip, she
tweeted, that sent "an unmistakable and resounding message to the entire
world: America stands firmly with Ukraine."

**[It would have been a much more resounding message had it been
bipartisan.]{.underline}**

The speaker's all-Democrat delegation included House Intelligence
Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), but the committee's
ranking Republican, Rep. Michael R. Turner (Ohio), was not invited,
according to congressional sources. Neither was Rep. Mike D. Rogers
(Ala.), the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee,
which is responsible for the \$33 billion military aid package President
Biden has requested for Ukraine. Yet a Democratic member of the
committee, Rep. Jason Crow (Colo.), was included. Pelosi's counterpart,
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), also was not invited
--- because of bad blood between them, a Pelosi spokesman told me. The
only ranking Republican on a committee with jurisdiction over Ukraine
policy to be invited was Rep. Michael McCaul (Tex.), the top Republican
on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who had just returned from his
third trip to the region and could not go.

After McCaul told Pelosi he could not go, he recommended she ask Rep.
Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), the ranking Republican on the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Europe. Fitzpatrick is also co-chairman of the
bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus and a former FBI agent whose
last assignment before entering Congress was in Kyiv. He had a prior
commitment, Fitzpatrick told me, but "I would have canceled in a second
if I had been invited." But he wasn't. Why didn't Pelosi include him?
Perhaps, he says, it's because he is on the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee's target list of 22 Republican or open seats it hopes
to win in November. McCaul also recommended that Pelosi invite Rep. Dan
Meuser (R-Pa.), another member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He also
did not receive an invitation.

The Pelosi spokesman told me that "numerous" GOP House members were
invited, though he declined to offer names, and that "none of the
Republicans accepted the invitation." He said that "given the security
precautions for this trip," members could not be told the destination
was Kyiv and were instead "told this was a codel to Poland." But McCaul
was told that the congressional delegation planned to go to Ukraine. And
the idea that Pelosi could not tell the destination to senior members of
Congress's national security committees --- who have access to our
nation's most highly classified intelligence --- is absurd. If she had
wanted to bring senior Republicans with her to meet with Zelensky, she
could have. Including Republicans who have been critical of her would
have sent a powerful message: Whatever our differences at home, we are
united in support of Ukraine. But she chose not to do so.

**[Ultimately, what matters more than the photo op is the military aid
package that Congress approves. But instead of calling the House back
into session upon her return to pass the \$33 billion in military and
humanitarian support immediately, Pelosi is linking the Ukraine aid to a
controversial package of billions in additional covid relief. Asked
about tying the two priorities together, Pelosi told reporters on
Friday: "I'm all for that," adding that "we need to have the covid
money."]{.underline}**

**[Pelosi knows full well that many Republicans have legitimate concerns
about additional pandemic spending after Democrats wasted on non-covid
projects much of the \$1.9 trillion they approved on a party-line vote
last year. She also knows that Senate Republicans are rightly linking a
vote on covid relief to a vote on bipartisan legislation to keep Title
42]{.underline}** --- the public health order that allows border
officials to turn away migrants in an effort to minimize virus spread
--- in place until 60 days after the surgeon general announces the end
of the pandemic public health emergency. **[So, linking Ukraine aid to
covid relief necessarily entangles it in the divisive politics of the
southern border.]{.underline}**

Pelosi might think she can get Republicans to back down on Title 42 by
blaming any delays in Ukraine aid on them. "This is called legislating,"
Pelosi said. Ukrainians are fighting for their lives --- they don't have
time to wait for Congress to "legislate" on extraneous issues.

**[Rep.]{.underline}** Michael **[Waltz]{.underline}** (R-Fla.) --- who
also was not invited to Kyiv by Pelosi but tells me he gladly would have
gone to meet Zelensky --- **[tweeted: "If Speaker Pelosi's tough talk in
Ukraine is serious, she should immediately call the House back into
session to vote on additional weapons for Ukraine that is NOT paired
with COVID spending. We are in a race against time with the
Russians."]{.underline}**

**[He's right. Not bringing any Republicans to Kyiv was a lost
opportunity. But playing political brinkmanship with aid to Ukraine that
enjoys broad bipartisan support would be a scandal with deadly
consequences.]{.underline}**

JEANNE SHAHEEN: **[We actually have a bill right now in the Senate that

NATO right now.]{.underline}**

**[LANGFITT: In an intensely polarized Washington, it was a rarity -

support for NATO and, since World War II, for a strong American role in

### Link Answer -- Ukraine

#### No link -- Americans support foreign policy especially against Russia - Ukraine proves

**Telhami, Foreign Policy Center for Middle East Policy Nonresident
Senior Fellow, 7-5-22** 

(Shibley, 7-5-22, Brookings, \"Americans' preparedness to pay a price
for supporting Ukraine remains
robust\", https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2022/07/05/americans-preparedness-to-pay-a-price-for-supporting-ukraine-remains-robust/, accessed
on 7-13-22, SR)

[In May, a University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll found a drop in
the American public's expressed preparedness to pay a price for
supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia, compared to the levels
expressed in March, on three dimensions: increased energy costs, rising
inflation, and preparedness to pay a price in American
lives.]{.underline} The latest edition of the Critical Issues Poll,
which I lead with Professor Stella Rouse, [finds that the drop in May
has not become a trend --- and in fact the expressed public preparedness
to pay a price has increased slightly since May]{.underline}, though it
remains lower than it was in March. The poll of 2,208 respondents was
fielded by Nielsen-Scarborough June 22-28, with a margin of error of +/-
2.09%. [The finding is especially notable given the increase in oil
prices and rising inflation that Americans have endured since the start
of the war --- and should be music to President Joe Biden's ears as his
administration has invested heavily in backing Ukraine, strengthening
and expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and
confronting Russia. Here are four key findings from the latest
poll:]{.underline}

[Americans are still prepared to support Ukraine even if this means
higher energy costs and increased inflation, with an uptick from May,
but below the level of support expressed in March.]{.underline} In the
June poll, 62% of respondents said they were prepared to endure higher
energy costs, up from 59% in May but down from 73% in March. Similarly,
58% expressed preparedness for increased inflation, up from 52% in May
but down from 65% in March. Americans' preparedness for the loss of U.S.
troops remains low at 32% but rose back to March levels after a dip in
May.

There are substantial differences in the degree of preparedness to pay a
price for supporting Ukraine between Democrats and Republicans, and the
gap between the two is slowly growing, with Democrats expressing much
greater willingness to pay a price. While 78% percent of Democrats are
prepared to see higher energy costs, only 44% of Republicans say the
same; while 72% of Democrats are prepared to pay with higher inflation,
only 39% of Republicans say the same.

The gap in preparedness to pay higher energy prices between Democrats
and Republicans has grown from 30 percentage points in March to 32
points in May to 34 in June. Similarly, on preparedness to see increased
inflation, the gap has grown from 28 percentage point in March to 31
points in May to 34 in June. On preparedness for loss of U.S. troops,
the gap between Democrats and Republicans grew in June from 5 percentage
points in March to 9 in May to 15 in June. Among Republicans, 22% are
prepared to risk American soldiers' lives compared to 37% of Democrats.

While a plurality of respondents says that both Russia and Ukraine are
neither succeeding nor failing in their war efforts (37% and 40%
respectively), they see Ukraine as more succeeding than failing (27% to
20%), while they see Russia as more failing than succeeding (29% to
20%). This holds for both Democrats and Republicans.

[Even though the Biden administration has opposed imposing a no-fly zone
(NFZ) over Ukraine, there is a growing public support for doing so,
despite the concern about confrontation with Russia.]{.underline}
Support for NFZ grew from 56% in March to 59% in May and 65% June. This
trend transcended party lines, with a growing number of Republicans (52%
to 54% to 57%) and Democrats (61% to 64% to 72%) supporting enforcing a
NFZ should the war persist. As we noted in our article in May, an
experiment we conducted in the May poll showed that respondents are more
reluctant to impose a NFZ when informed of the potential direct conflict
with Russia inherent in the act, but are more supportive when there is
no mention of a direct connection. The trend could be a result of the
public not making a direct connection to confrontation with Russia,
possibly coupled with public wish for more decisive NATO support for
Ukraine.

**[The findings suggest that the drop in American public preparedness to
pay a price for supporting Ukraine and confronting Russia has not become
a trend; in fact, there is a slight uptick in the expressed preparedness
to pay a price, compared to a month earlier, though slightly lower
preparedness to pay a price than in March.]{.underline}** This is good
news for the Biden administration which has prioritized support for
Ukraine. If fatigue grows, it would be music to Russian President
Vladimir Putin's ears. Aside from the heavy price Ukrainians are paying
for the war fought on their territory, the Russian people are paying the
second-highest cost --- much more than the cost born by Americans in
their support role for Ukraine. But Putin could count on this if
American fatigue grows: Over time, public fatigue in democracies is more
likely to be politically consequential than in autocracies, as leaders
in democracies tend to be more sensitive to the attitudes of their
publics.

[It is also notable that few Americans see Russia as winning the war,
something that almost always affects the calculus for staying the
course. Our poll finds that respondents who say Russia is failing are
more likely to be prepared to pay a price for supporting Ukraine than
those who say Russia is succeeding.]{.underline} i/L -

#### i/L - Support for Ukraine has bipartisan support, any many policy makers see it as the main threat

**Clark, Washington Times National Security and Congress Reporter,
22** (Joseph, 7-7-2022, The Washington Times, \"Ukrainian-born member of
U.S. House blasts Biden, Zelenskyy for Ukraine war
politicking\", https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/jul/7/ukrainian-born-member-us-house-blasts-biden-zelens/, accessed
on 7-13-2022, SR)

The first and only Ukrainian-born member of the U.S. House accused
President Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of "playing
politics with people's lives" as the war in Ukraine rages with no clear
end in sight.

Republican Rep. Victoria Spartz, who was among the first members of
Congress to visit post-invasion Ukraine, signaled the limits of
unbridled support from Capitol Hill for an aimless war in a scathing
statement Wednesday.

["President Biden has to stop playing politics, have a clear strategy
and align security assistance with our strategy," Ms. Spartz, Indiana
Republican, said in her statement in which she listed "urgent action
items needed to get the situation under control."]{.underline}

[She said Mr. Zelenskyy "has to stop playing politics and theater, and
start governing to better support his military and local governments,"
**and called on Congress to "establish proper oversight of critical
infrastructure and delivery of weapons."**]{.underline}

Ms. Spartz has introduced several measures in support of Ukraine since
Russia's invasion of her homeland in late February including a bill to
allow U.S. citizens to fight for Ukraine and legislation to remove red
tape from U.S. aid shipments to the country.

[She offered a resolution in early March expressing "unequivocal support
for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."]{.underline}

In May, Ms. Spartz voted in favor of the \$40 billion supplemental aid
package for Ukraine which 57 of her Republican House colleagues voted
against.

Her recent criticism, however, suggests that she does not offer her
support for Ukraine blindly.

"My understanding of the situation in Ukraine is not from books or
theories or surveillance reports and analytics, but from seeing and
hearing what's actually happening with my own eyes," she said.

Ms. Spartz's critique could signal added challenges for President Biden
in the coming months.

The White House has not ruled out needing to ask Congress for additional
aid as Russia's unrelenting assault drags on.

The U.S. has provided \$6.9 billion in security assistance to Ukraine
since the invasion, and each new weapons shipment chips away at the last
\$40 billion package approved by Congress last month.

National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters last month
that it is impossible to predict how long the war will last and said it
is too early to tell whether the administration will need additional
funding.

["President Biden has made it clear that we're going to continue to
support Ukraine as much as we can, as fast as we can," he said. "And
we're doing that. We'll see where this goes going forward."]{.underline}

**[Members of Congress from both parties overwhelmingly supported the
last package, which included economic and humanitarian assistance along
with military aid.]{.underline}** The House approved the package by a
368 to 57 margin, and the Senate voted 86 to 11 to send the bill to the
president's desk.

Although support for the last package was overwhelming in Congress, it
was not unanimous.

A group of 57 Republicans in the House and 11 Republicans in the Senate
voted against the measure. Some of the lawmakers objected to what they
said was a lack of accountability for the lethal aid after a measure to
specifically fund the Department of Defense Inspector General to oversee
the assistance.

Some of the lawmakers also objected to sending aid to Ukraine while
America faces growing problems on its Southwest border, supply chain
snags and rising costs from inflation.

[Other lawmakers' objections to the aid aligned with Ms. Spartz's more
recent criticism of President Biden's lack of a clear strategy in
Ukraine, which they said should direct the aid.]{.underline}

The administration has been wary to define the contours of the war and
has pledged that Ukraine alone will define its victory, but a small
group of lawmakers has begun asking how the war ends and how much it
will cost.

"I will not go into many problems at this time and there are plenty of
them, but will just list three urgent action items needed to get the
situation under control," she said before listing her grievances with
Messrs. Biden and Zelenskyy's leadership and Congress' lack of
oversight.

objectives](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/russia-weakedend-lloyd-austin-ukraine) in
the conflict, to not just support Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial
integrity but also to weaken Russia, with the aim of preventing a repeat
of Moscow's aggression against other countries.

A European diplomat suggested that one of the factors behind that shift
was impatience in the higher levels of the party with the
administration's posture.

["It's fundamentally about trying to get on the front foot in this
crisis. There's a lot of domestic criticism of the administration for
being so passive," the official said]{.underline}.

"The Hill \[Congress\] are cross and a lot of the big Democratic donors
think it's not being as forthright as America should be ... Biden thinks
he's treading a careful path between intervention in its broader sense
and keeping the focus on domestic concerns -- and some Democrats are
starting to think that balance isn't right."

**[Senator Chris Coons, a senior figure in Democratic foreign policy
circles, has criticised Biden for taking direct military intervention
off the table as an option. On the other side of the party, there has
been little pushback from the progressive wing, which is normally
sceptical about sending large quantities of military hardware into
foreign conflicts.]{.underline}**

**[And for once in Washington, the Republicans are pushing in the same
direction.]{.underline}**

**["This is one of the few areas where Democrats and Republicans are
reasonably well united and that makes it pretty easy for a president to
move in that direction. He's not making enemies,"]{.underline}** said
Larry Sabato, politics professor at the University of Virginia.

"The umbrella over all of this is the moral issue and the powerful video
of Ukrainians being slaughtered and dislocated," John Zogby, a pollster
and political consultant, said. "Americans are moved by that and
overwhelmingly support the Ukrainian people."

It is nonetheless a political wedge issue. Support is more uniform among
Democrats than Republicans. Donald Trump transferred his personal
admiration for Vladimir Putin to at least some of his followers and the
Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, who has [consistently raised
pro-Moscow talking points on his
show](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/25/tucker-carlson-fox-news-russia-putin).

Democratic support is deepened by the important role of
Ukrainian-Americans, thought to represent about 1 million people (Zogby
thinks that is an underestimate) and who are influential on the party's
ethnic coordinating council. They have all the more sway because they
are concentrated in swing states.

**["You've got a decent number of Ukrainians in Ohio, and you have a
Senate race in Ohio. There are Ukrainians in Pennsylvania and you have a
Senate race in Pennsylvania," said Wendy Schiller, political science
professor at Brown University.]{.underline}**

In Wisconsin, Democrats have been running ads against the incumbent
Senator Ron Johnson, focusing on his 2018 visit to Moscow.

**["It's not an accident that Nancy Pelosi went
to [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)," Schiller said.
"To have the speaker go, it says this is going to be an issue that the
national party is going to take into the midterm
elections."]{.underline}**

**[With state-level and national politics, moral outrage among the
public and Biden's own foreign policy instincts, all pointing in the
same direction, the administration has sharply raised its stake in the
Ukraine conflict, asking Congress for an extraordinary \$33bn in
military, economic and humanitarian support for Kyiv.]{.underline}**

Public support, however, dies away dramatically when it comes to the
question of sending US troops. Only 21% asked in this week's poll backed
such direct intervention, and concern about Ukraine escalating into a
nuclear conflict is significantly higher among Democrats than
Republicans.

**[Biden, who has made extricating the US from "forever wars" his
signature foreign policy, has repeatedly said he will not send US troops
into Ukraine, and has cancelled routine missile tests to reduce any risk
of misunderstanding and miscalculation between the two nuclear
superpowers.]{.underline}**

"Boots on the ground may very well be a very different story," Zogby
said. "I don't think world war three polls very well."

[Congress is passing measures to support Ukraine on a wide, bipartisan
basis, and fast, and they have the support of a majority of the
U.S.]{.underline}

President Joe Biden signed a lend-lease program to get military aid to
Ukraine on Monday, which passed on Monday the Senate by unanimous
consent, and on Tuesday, the House passed \$40 billion in emergency
funding to Ukraine on a 368-to-5 vote. [Biden previously hoped to pass
the supplemental Ukrainian aid simultaneously with new COVID relief
ahead of a possible fall surge of the virus, **but scrapped the plan to
win over Republicans, saying Monday "we cannot afford
delay."**]{.underline}

The \$40 aid bill now heads to the Senate, where [Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer said "time is of the essence."]{.underline}

["President Biden has made clear that the aid provided by Congress a few
months ago is now near its end," Schumer said Wednesday on the Senate
floor. "As we acted quickly and decisively a few months ago, we must do
so again very, very soon, and I will make sure this is a priority for
the Senate."]{.underline}

[Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the war in Ukraine **"the
most important thing going on in the world right now."**]{.underline}

New polling shows Congress has majority support across both major
political parties. Two-thirds of U.S. adults support strict economic
sanctions on Russia, according to a Pew Research Center poll released
Tuesday. The poll also found 71% support sending military equipment and
weapons to Ukraine and 64% support stationing U.S. forces in NATO
countries.

[And while Democrats and Democratic leaners are more likely to support
these measures, 60% of Republicans and Republican leaners still back
U.S. troops in NATO countries, and 73% support sanctions.]{.underline}

[**Ukraine is a relative bright spot for Biden's approval.** The Pew
poll found more U.S. adults approve his administration's response to
Russia's invasion than disapprove,]{.underline} 45% to 34%, including a
growing minority of Republicans. Between March and May, the percentage
of Republicans and Republican leaners who approve of Biden's handling of
the situation in Ukraine has grown from 21% to 26%.

The percentage of Americans who believe the U.S. hasn't done enough for
Ukraine has fallen from 42% in March to 31% in May. About a third
believe U.S. support is about right, 22% aren't sure, and 12% say it's
too much.

The poll was conducted between April 25 and May 1, 2022 with a panel of
5,074 respondents with a sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage
points.

**[Why should NATO want to stop Russia, or anyone, fighting wars on its
border? The obvious answer is to prevent the humanitarian suffering it
causes, now seen graphically in Ukraine.]{.underline}** **[This
responsibility to protect life is keenly felt by member
states,]{.underline}** for many of whom it is central to their foreign
policy. **[To be reduced to well-informed bystanders will be for
them]{.underline}** **[morally if not politically
untenable.]{.underline}**

**[But, secondly, being unable to stop Russian expansion on its borders
damages the credibility of NATO as a bulwark against aggression, and
Russian aggression in particular]{.underline}**. For Russia's military
command, there will not only be no evidence that NATO was prepared to
fight Russia, but also a consistent line that it will always avoid
escalation and direct conflict. Russia will feel licensed to repeat its
expansionist operations elsewhere.

Thirdly, if Russia's wars are successful, it will convert the territory
it acquires into forward military and intelligence bases, as it did in
Syria, the principal purpose of which will be to give it strategic
advantage over NATO. Doing that in Ukraine will allow Putin to eat away,
at his leisure, at the softer edges of NATO.

### Link Answer -- Cybersecurity Bipartisan

#### No link -- Congress supports bolstering NATO cybersecurity

**[The other battlefield: It isn\'t only Russia\'s military might that
has some U.S. lawmakers and experts concerned about what\'s next in the
conflict with Ukraine. They\'re also worried about a stealthy but
possibly just as damaging enemy: cyber warfare.]{.underline}**

**[They believe that as Russian President]{.underline}** Vladimir
**[Putin is pressed on the battlefield and continues to be squeezed by
the sharp bite of U.S. and European sanctions, NATO\'s newly evolved
cyber policy might not be prepared to respond.]{.underline}**

**[Over the past decade, NATO --- like most organizations and entities
--- has modernized its cyber defensive posture and
practices]{.underline}**, prompting NATO to say last year that it would
"weigh 'on a case-by-case basis' whether a cyberattack would trigger its
Article 5 collective defense principle, which establishes that an attack
against one ally is an attack against all allies," our colleagues Cat
Zakrzewski and Joseph Menn reported last month.

"We will not speculate on how serious a cyberattack would have to be in
order to trigger a collective response," a NATO official told reporters
month. "Any response could include diplomatic and economic sanctions,
cyber measures, or even conventional forces, depending on the nature of
the attack," the official added.

**[The updated policy, according to former U.S. ambassadors to NATO and
experts who work closely with the organization, has come a long way
since Russian-based attackers launched massive cyberattacks on
Estonia]{.underline}** over the removal of a Soviet war memorial in the
small Baltic country in 2007.

As it currently stands, NATO leaders were deliberately ambiguous in
defining what would qualify as an Article 5 attack when revising the
group\'s cyber policy, "so as not to create a clear-cut threshold
beneath which an opponent could operate freely," said Douglas Lute, a
former U.S. ambassador to NATO. **[But there is some concern the
ambiguity might muddle a potential response to a
cyberattack.]{.underline}**

Key quote: **["If you have a catastrophic cyberattack that shuts down
your \[power\] grids or shuts down your ability to keep your people warm
in the winter or fed or what have you, we\'ve got to figure that out. I
think NATO needs to get together and have those very difficult
\[discussions\] because it is a component of war, as I said before, and
I think it needs to be viewed as such," Rep.]{.underline}** John
**[Katko]{.underline}** (R-N.Y.), **[the top Republican on the House
Homeland Security panel, told The Washington Post]{.underline}** in an
interview last week.

**["I think it\'s evolving. Do they have more to go? Absolutely," Katko

**[Throughout the 117th Congress, there continues to be strong

initiatives. This has been all the more enhanced by the Biden
Administration's prioritization of this issue. Especially in an
increasingly tense and partisan atmosphere, where policymakers will
continue to diverge from bipartisan agreements with an election on the
horizon, cybersecurity issues will continue to be a strong opportunity
for lawmakers to facilitate real impact through efforts that cross party

broader packages, there has also been significant traction to move
smaller, less controversial bills that can quickly move through the
legislative process, which has been supplemented by strong advocacy
efforts from influential cybersecurity leaders on both sides of the

### Link Answer -- Cyber Not Perceived

#### No link -- Cyber exploits are secretive, one-time use, and obfuscate responsibility avoiding congressional oversight

**Vinik, POLITICO The Agenda assistant editor, 15**

(Danny Vinik, assistant editor for The Agenda at Politico, POLITICO,
12-9-15, \"America's secret arsenal,\" The Agenda,
https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2015/12/defense-department-cyber-offense-strategy-000331/,
accessed 7-13-22) SS:/

**[WHEN I SET out to examine the U.S.'s offensive cyber capabilities,
the first question I asked experts was what type of cyber weapons the
U.S. possesses, expecting a range of answers. With kinetic weapons,
Americans are well aware of the power of our military arsenal and have
some sense of the consequences of our traditional and nuclear
capacities. I expected to learn something similar from cyber
experts.]{.underline}**

**[That's not what happened. In fact, cyber weapons exist in a realm not
unlike the early days of the nuclear program, shrouded in secrecy, with
plenty of curiosity but very little public information. In part this
secrecy is integral to the whole concept: a cyberattack is useful
insofar as the enemy is unaware of it. The more the government reveals
about what's in its arsenal, the more our adversaries can do to protect
themselves.]{.underline}**

**[\"If you know much about it, \[cyber is\] very easy to defend
against,\" said]{.underline}** Michael **[Daniel, a special assistant to
the president and cybersecurity coordinator at the National Security
Council. \"Therefore, that's why we keep a lot of those capabilities
very closely guarded.\"]{.underline}**

One thing everyone I spoke to agreed on: [The U.S. has the most powerful
cyber arsenal in the world.]{.underline} Brandon Valeriano, a lecturer
at the University of Glasgow who focuses on cyber conflict, used the
example of the North Korean Internet interruption in December 2014, when
the nation's fledgling Internet went out for a few hours, just a few
days after the White House blamed the Sony hack on Pyongyang. "[If
America wanted to take down North Korea's Internet," he said, "it
wouldn't be two to three hours. It would be devastating]{.underline}."

[A cyber weapon, called a "capability" in the field, is a piece of
malicious code that exploits a flaw in an enemy's software; the point is
to manipulate, disrupt or destroy computers, information systems,
networks or physical infrastructure controlled by computer systems. An
attacker could use a cyber weapon to take down another country's
financial systems or electrical systems.]{.underline}

"[Anything that has a computer anywhere on earth can be stopped or taken
over]{.underline}," said Jason **[Healey, the head of the Atlantic
Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative and former director for cyber
infrastructure protection]{.underline}** in the George W. Bush White
House from 2003 to 2005.

[The most powerful cyber capabilities, called "zero-days," exploit
software vulnerabilities unknown even to the author of the software
itself---for example, a security hole in the Windows operating system
that even Microsoft doesn't know is there.]{.underline} They're called
zero-days because [once discovered, the author has zero days to fix
them---people can immediately use them to cause damage.]{.underline}

[As weapons, cyber capabilities differ in a few key ways]{.underline}
from traditional weapons like missiles and bombs. First, [they cause
damage that's less overt but more widespread than a physical attack---a
cyber weapon could cripple a local economy by attacking a country's
financial or communication systems]{.underline}. Second, [an attack can
occur almost instantaneously against any target in the world. The
Internet makes physical distance between enemies all but irrelevant,
making it both easier for enemies to launch cyberattacks and harder for
the government to monitor for them.]{.underline} Third, [**the use of a
cyber capability is often a one-time deal: If the government has a piece
of malicious software and uses it to exploit a flaw in an enemy's code,
it could render future uses of that capability ineffective, since the
adversary could just patch it**.]{.underline} **[It could also
compromise intelligence-collection activities that use the same
exploit.]{.underline}**

**[Furthermore, the line between a military attack and an espionage
operation is far blurrier in the cyber realm. A cyberattack generally
doesn't involve the movement of physical objects and does not put the
attacker's soldiers at risk. "All of the potential red flags that would
pop up and get congressional attention don\'t," said]{.underline}**
Peter **[Singer, a renowned cyber expert and author of "Cybersecurity
and Cyberwar: What Everyone Needs To Know."]{.underline}** [The same
exploit might be used by intelligence agencies to spy on an enemy, or as
an offensive weapon to mount a sudden attack.]{.underline}

**[That blurriness can be used to cloak responsibility]{.underline}**,
many observers think. For example, analysts have pointed out **[that if
Stuxnet were indeed a U.S. operation---as is widely believed by
now---the administration could avoid taking public responsibility for it
by classifying it as an intelligence operation, rather than
military]{.underline}**.

**[Progressives have a plan to expand antitrust law that would
effectively nationalize America's most successful companies. They even
hope to get conservatives on board. The bill most likely to get
consideration this Congress would,]{.underline}** according to Ryan
**[Bourne and]{.underline}** Brad **[Subramaniam of the Cato Institute,
"generally make it unlawful for major online platforms to engage in
conduct that has produced tech products that consumers
enjoy."]{.underline}**

**[This proposal, if enacted, would prevent Apple from preloading
FaceTime and iMessage into your apps and Google would have to remove
Google Maps.]{.underline}** Amazon Prime would be "de facto banned."

**[If this sounds to you like a bad deal for consumers, you are spot on.
This is nothing more than a Trojan Horse bill intended to expand federal
power over the private sector.]{.underline}**

**[Conservatives have a long history of embracing free-market economics.
It wasn't so long ago that the Republican Party was known for
encouraging entrepreneurship and celebrating success. Now, there is an
emerging split between the populist wing and the traditional free
marketeers of the Republican Party that endangers the economy. Because
this fight is over Big Tech, some on the right are willing to toss aside
small, limited government first principles for short-term political
gain.]{.underline}**

One Republican has dug in for the fight and is willing to take on Big
Government ideas coming from both progressive Democrats and populist
Republicans. For Fox News, Republican Sen. Rand Paul wrote on June 13,
2022, that he shares a degree of anger with Big Tech companies, yet he
will not toss aside his love of "free-market principles" for legislation
that would "deprive consumers of the technological innovation that only
free-market competition can provide."

Mr. Paul criticized Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar's bill, the American
Innovation and Choice Online Act (S. 2992), as creating a presumption
that mergers are a violation of antitrust law. Mr. Paul remains critical
of Republican Sen. Josh Hawley's bill, the Trust-Busting for the
Twenty-First Century Act (S. 1074), that would forward the progressive
goal of "preventing mergers" and ignoring "the welfare of the consumer."
The Hawley bill bans all mergers and acquisitions by companies with a
market capitalization exceeding \$100 billion. The Klobuchar bill is an
attempt to empower government bureaucrats' control over private
enterprise, while the Hawley bill is a direct attack on success. Both
would lead to pain for consumers and stagnation for a struggling
American economy.

Ms. **[Klobuchar's legislation would expand the power of the Federal
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice over private
enterprise.]{.underline}** President Biden's pick to run the FTC, Lina
Khan, actually wrote an early version of this legislation. Politico
reported in May, "Lina Khan, President Joe Biden's Federal Trade
Commission chair, helped write the House version of the American
Innovation and Choice Online Act when she was a staffer on the Judiciary
Committee." The Politico story cited heartburn from moderate Democrats
who fear the radical legislation will cause even more economic headwinds
and weaken the party's electoral prospects. Progressive Democrats intend
on rushing this legislation through the Senate because they worry that a
potential Republican majority following an election dominated by
economic concerns would be less apt to beat up on successful technology
companies.

These words from President Ronald Reagan are as true today as they were
in 1981: "We who live in free-market societies believe that growth,
prosperity, and ultimately human fulfillment, are created from the
bottom up, not the government down." **[Brilliant entrepreneurs are far
better at driving the economy than unelected government
bureaucrats.]{.underline}**

**[American consumers and voters don't want a federal government that
has racked up over \$30 trillion in debt to run our nation's most
innovative corporations into the ground.]{.underline}**
