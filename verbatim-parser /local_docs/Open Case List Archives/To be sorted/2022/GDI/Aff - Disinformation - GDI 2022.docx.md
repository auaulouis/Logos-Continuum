NATO's Approach to Disinformation

Since its founding, NATO's approach to countering disinformation has
evolved alongside the threat environment. The Alliance has always
recognized that security and stability derive from military as well as
non-military means but has historically prioritized the former over the
latter. **[It took several years and the proliferation of direct
disinformation attacks against NATO for the Alliance to recognize the
threat and begin operationalizing a response---an ongoing process that
continues today.]{.underline}**

During the Cold War, NATO prioritized conventional defense and
deterrence and only tangentially considered disinformation. The 1956
Committee of Three report acknowledged that Soviet leaders had "been
sowing seeds of falsehood" against the Alliance for many years and that
some within NATO believed the Alliance was no longer necessary after
serving "a useful defensive and deterrent role in the Stalinist era."
The report also lamented NATO's failure to inform its member states'
publics "of the importance of the part played by NATO in preserving
freedom," limited coordination on national information policy, and low
financial support for expanding information activities.13 The 1967
Harmel Report addressed disinformation only indirectly, stating that
NATO's main function was "to maintain adequate military strength and
political solidarity to deter aggression."14 Disinformation threatened
to undermine solidarity and cohesion, but the existential security
threat posed by the Soviet Union led NATO to prioritize conventional
defense and deterrence.

**[After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the conventional military
balance shifted in NATO's favor. The Alliance began focusing on
non-military threats, although not always disinformation. In 2010, an
independent expert group commissioned by NATO argued that "the Alliance
has ample grounds for confidence" given the lower risk of conventional
military aggression and cautioned against unconventional threats but not
disinformation specifically.15]{.underline}** **[Official communiqués
also exemplify this trend.]{.underline}** The 2014 Wales Summit
Declaration suggested "enhancing strategic communications" to counter
hybrid threats without naming disinformation.16 NATO's current Strategic
Concept likewise excludes disinformation from its list of unconventional
threats.

**[Since]{.underline}** the Kremlin's illegal and illegitimate invasion
of Ukraine and annexation of **[Crimea in 2014, disinformation
narratives targeting NATO have intensified and so-called fake news,
manipulated facts, and slanted narratives have become a daily
reality]{.underline}**.17 **[Short-term false narratives have targeted
Alliance operations, including a NATO military jet colliding with a
Russian commercial airplane]{.underline}**,18 the Alliance assembling
3,600 tanks on Russia's border,19 and civilians being killed or harmed
during NATO military exercises.20 **[Other narratives are longer-term,
strategic, and target the Alliance's enduring purpose and solidarity,
claiming that NATO's exercises are dangerous and threaten Russia's
security]{.underline}**, defense expenditures are excessive, the
Alliance disingenuously justifies new deployments,21 **[and that NATO
broke a promise by continuing to expand and is encircling
Russia.]{.underline}**22 These narratives are not new but their
proliferation since 2014 has unambiguously brought disinformation onto
NATO's agenda.

**[While NATO was quick to enhance conventional defense and deterrence
along the eastern flank after 2014]{.underline}**,23 **[there was
insufficient support within the Alliance to similarly adapt its
non-military means.]{.underline}** The 2016 Warsaw Summit Communiqué
mentions hybrid threats broadly, and **[it was not until the 2018
Brussels Summit]{.underline}** **[that an official summit declaration
named disinformation specifically.]{.underline}** **[Most recently, the
NATO 2030 initiative was launched at the 2019 London
Summit]{.underline}**---and on the heels of President of France Emmanuel
Macron calling the Alliance "braindead"24---**[to "further strengthen
NATO's political dimension.]{.underline}**"25 This was a forewarning of
sorts that NATO's non-military malaise could have wider consequences.

**[This proved prescient during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Kremlin's
disinformation has targeted land- and sea-based military exercises and
NATO's presence in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland.]{.underline}**26
**[Narratives have also claimed inter alia that NATO created COVID-19,
the pandemic would cause NATO to disintegrate, and the Alliance is inept
against the virus.]{.underline}**27 **[China's increasingly assertive
public diplomacy campaign---and outright fabrication, for example, that
the virus originated in Italy28]{.underline}**---**[aims to undermine
trust among Allies, promote its own system over
democracy]{.underline}**,29 **[and increase its influence and standing
vis-à-vis Europe.]{.underline}**30 **[Although Russia and China's
disinformation specifically targeted NATO, created narratives blaming
troops for spreading the virus,]{.underline}**31 and attempted to
undermine the Alliance's public health messaging, **[NATO's response
early in the pandemic was limited to correcting facts and false
narratives ex post after they had entered the public
domain.]{.underline}**32 **[The volume of NATO's online communication,
especially during the first few months of the pandemic, was also far
smaller than what hostile actors were able to project through their
massive state media and social media networks]{.underline}**.33
**[Looking towards the coming decade, three common themes have emerged.
First, while NATO has bolstered its public diplomacy and strategic
communications in recent years, its response to disinformation has
largely remained reactive rather than]{.underline}**
**[proactive,]{.underline}** **[focusing primarily on positive messaging
and countering narratives after they appear.]{.underline}** Its
twin-track "understand and engage" model tracks the information
environment, tailors communications,34 corrects facts, and improves
media literacy.35 This likely derives from NATO's defensive strategic
culture and is therefore unlikely to fundamentally change. Nonetheless,
**[it has at times placed the Alliance at a distinct disadvantage from
the Cold War to the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, national and
Alliance-level efforts are not fully aligned. National militaries are
adapting more quickly to counter disinformation and other unconventional
threats.]{.underline}** **[US Army Europe has initiated drills to
prepare against disinformation and cyberattacks, and implemented a
sensor network to monitor news across Europe to increase its speed of
response.]{.underline}**36 **[When the Kremlin's disinformation
narratives targeted the Defender 2020 military exercise last year, the
US coordinated bilaterally with Allies to respond rather than at the
multinational level]{.underline}**.37 **[The broader challenge is
harmonizing national information policy]{.underline}**. **[The US
Department of State's Center for Information Analysis and Response,
which collects and analyzes foreign information warfare
efforts]{.underline}**, and the government of **[Lithuania's "national
information influence identification and analysis
ecosystem]{.underline}**"38 **[are two recent examples which have
remained at the national level. Third, NATO has yet to define precisely
where disinformation fits among the constellation of emerging security
threats. This is inherently difficult because it presents simultaneous
operational, strategic, and existential challenges]{.underline}** and is
impossible to measure with confidence. **[The Alliance includes
disinformation within hybrid and grey zone threats]{.underline}**.39
**[For example, the 2018 Brussels Declaration warned that NATO faces
"hybrid challenges, including disinformation campaigns and malicious
cyber activities]{.underline}**."40 **[The NATO 2030 Reflection Group's
report linked disinformation to grey zone activities]{.underline}**,
which have "eroded the traditional boundaries of conflict" and "weaken
and divide Allies from within by undermining societal cohesion and our
way of life."41 **[This illustrates a compartmentalized rather than
harmonized view of the threat environment, particularly towards
non-military threats.]{.underline}** The 2021 Brussels Summit Communiqué
shows progress by more frequently mentioning disinformation in the
context of hybrid threats, highlights the capabilities of Counter Hybrid
Support Teams, and recognizes Russia and China as perpetrators of
disinformation.42 **[Looking to 2030, NATO's non-military approach must
continue to evolve.]{.underline}**

### Contention 2 -- Information Credibility

#### Must act now to prevent disinformation -- Disinformation magnifies all impacts -- it is a force magnifier, spoiler and entangler -- undermining democratic institutions, deterrence, and NATO cohesion

Disinformation, fake news and---since the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in
2020---"infodemics" have been added to the vocabulary of societies
across the world. Often conflated with other terms including
misinformation, tainted leaks, and propaganda, **[disinformation is the
use of false or manipulated information to distort the truth, weaken
trust, and undermine democratic discourse and practices. It has become a
catch-all for information manipulation operations and has fundamentally
altered the way we view geopolitical competition, warfare, and
security.]{.underline}**

**[For NATO,]{.underline}** a defensive military alliance based on
collective defense---"an attack against one is an attack against
all"---**[disinformation has until recently been rarely discussed, much
less considered. Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, however,
underscores that "peaceful and friendly international relations" come
not from military strength alone, but strong and free member state
institutions and an understanding of the principles behind
them.]{.underline}**1 **[Disinformation, which is part of broader malign
influence operations, directly threatens these principles and
institutions]{.underline}**. **[Its acceleration in recent years has
brought disinformation onto the transatlantic agenda.]{.underline}**

**[In the coming decade, NATO is likely to face an increasingly complex
and contested strategic environment. Disinformation will lurk as a
force-multiplier, spoiler, and entangler.]{.underline}** **[Russia and
China have demonstrated willingness to deploy non-military means against
NATO and could intensify the use of disinformation with the benefit of
emerging technologies.]{.underline}** **[At the operational
level]{.underline}**, **[disinformation could increasingly probe and
erode NATO's defense and deterrence]{.underline}**. **[At the strategic
level, long-term information operations and narratives skeptical
of]{.underline}** **[NATO's enduring purpose could weaken solidarity and
cohesion. To protect its political center-of-gravity, NATO should
crystallize where disinformation fits among the multiplicity of threats
likely facing the Alliance in the emerging security environment and then
further evolve its approach to countering disinformation.]{.underline}**

#### Disinformation is a force factor in international conflicts, combined with other attack vectors it pushes countries to the brink of conventional warfare.

[Several countries have already contextualized disinformation as a
national security threat. **The US** State Department **defines
disinformation as a 'quick and fairly cheap way to destabilize societies
and set the stage for potential military action'**]{.underline}.^15^ A
joint US State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff white paper later
posited that: [*"Information has been weaponized, and disinformation has
become an incisive instrument of state policy*".]{.underline}^16^
Russian General Valery Gerasimov wrote in a 2013 article portraying
disinformation as crucial: "[**The role of nonmilitary means of
achieving political and strategic goals** *has grown, and, in many
cases, they* **have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their
effectiveness**]{.underline}".^17^ Similarly United Nations Development
Program discourse also constructs disinformation as a weapon -- a trend,
which began with the COVID-19 pandemic.^18^ In the same vein, [NATO's
securitization of disinformation began with the first Ukraine
war]{.underline} (2014) [and remained as a crucial component of hybrid
warfare in NATO doctrines]{.underline}.^19^ The concept of a digital
information war had already been included in Russian 2010 Military
Doctrine, which was broadened in its 2014 update to include social media
and ICTs.^20^ Since then, both [practices and allegations of
disinformation have proliferated across other governments including
China, UK, France, Italy, South Africa, Turkey and Kenya (among others),
where **disinformation is used domestically to discredit political
opponents, a foreign policy tool to confuse international rivals** and a
key threat that has to be defended against]{.underline} -- all at the
same time.^21^

Indeed, [disinformation is increasingly being used as a force factor
during international crises. During the 2017 Gulf crisis between Saudi
Arabia, Qatar and the UAE, a robust **disinformation campaign, followed
by cyber-attacks**, brought them to the **brink of limited conventional
war** and required significant diplomatic effort to disentangle the
damage caused by disinformation.]{.underline}^22^ In that case,
**[disinformation had significantly aided in the escalation of the
crisis, increasing the costs of backing down by raising audience
costs.]{.underline}** Following the shooting down of its SU24 in
northern Syria**[, Russia had launched a major disinformation campaign
against Turkey, drawing a wedge between Ankara and other NATO countries
on the Syrian war, damaging intra-alliance cohesion and ultimately
creating itself a relatively unchallenged information space as it
entered the Syrian theatre militarily.]{.underline}**^23^ **[In Nigeria,
the government employed a disinformation campaign in the last decade
targeting international aid agencies and workers, significantly
impairing the ability of those agencies to work on humanitarian relief
in the country.]{.underline}**^24^ **[From click farms of Indonesia to
the 'black campaigning' in the Philippines, disinformation is being
deployed as a distinct strategy to discredit and demobilize regional
politics in Southeast Asia and more recently, to sow mistrust towards
China's SinovacCoronaVac vaccine.]{.underline}**^25^

#### The impact is existential - Compromised information undermines Civilization, threatens Elections, Lives, and the Economy, and magnifies the likelihood of Nuclear War and Climate Change.

**Lin, Stanford University Center for International Security and
Cooperation Senior Research Scholar, 19**

(Herb Lin, Stanford University Center for International Security and
Cooperation Cyber Policy and Security Senior Research Scholar and Hoover
Institution Cyber policy and Security Hank J. Holland Fellow,
ResearchGate, 7-1-2019, \" The existential threat from cyber-enabled
information warfare,\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Vol. 75, No.
4, p. 187-196
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334089405_The_existential_threat_from_cyber-enabled_information_warfare,
p. 3-5, accessed 7-8-2022) SS:/

Founded in 1945, the Bulletin first focused on the existential threat
from nuclear war. The atomic scientists of the Manhattan Project did not
believe that the miniature suns let loose on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
themselves posed an existential threat to human existence.^4^ But most
of them recognized that they were omens of a future in which [nuclear
weapons, used on a large scale, could]{.underline} indeed [threaten
human existence, and]{.underline} even [used on a smaller scale could
threaten modern human civilization.]{.underline}

After sporadically reporting on climate change for decades, in 2007 the
Bulletin formally expanded its concept of existential threat to include
that and nuclear war.^5^ [Where large-scale nuclear war threatens to
snuff out hundreds of millions of lives in a matter of hours, climate
change threatens to alter the planetary ecosystem]{.underline}. Here
[the effects are more subtle and less easily noticed because they are
cumulative over decades. There is no single cataclysmic event in the
offing, and yet myriad smaller regional disasters will result: more
intense and more frequent forest fires, heat waves, and storms; vastly
increased coastal flooding and rising sea levels; loss of arable land;
severe shortages of food and water; and mass migrations and
relocations.]{.underline}

[Nuclear war and climate change threaten the physical infrastructure of
human civilization as well as the underlying geochemical processes and
the ecology of the planet]{.underline}. [Because most people depend on
both physical infrastructure and our global ecology for food, energy,
and other necessities of existence, nuclear war and climate change put
the lives of the great mass of humanity at risk]{.underline}. [Because
nuclear war and climate change threaten massive changes in cultural
identity and the loss of historical resources, our civilization and our
legacy are at stake, too]{.underline}. In those ways, both nuclear war
and climate change pose existential threats to humanity. But these are
not the only such threats to civilization as we know it.

[The infrastructure for human civilization is]{.underline} undeniably
tangible (that is, physical, chemical, and biological), but it is
**[increasingly virtual]{.underline}** as well, and the virtual aspects
of that infrastructure---**[the information ecosystem]{.underline}** (or
environment)---in many ways **[has become central and often critical to
the way people now live all over the world.]{.underline}**

In the words of Yale Law School's information scholar Jack Balkin, "it
is not an exaggeration to say that **[modern states are informational
states: states that recognize and solve problems of governance by
collecting, analyzing, and distributing information.]{.underline}**"^6^
Consider that **[nations require good information to allocate benefits
and social services to the populace; to administer mechanisms for public
safety]{.underline}** (e.g., law enforcement, court systems,
fire-fighting); **[to provide for national security; to gather revenue
to support national expenditures; and to engage with other nations in
ways that support national interests.]{.underline}**

Businesses and nonprofit entities in turn are also highly dependent on
information. They use it to develop products and services for customers
and clients; to understand markets and audiences for their products and
services; to inform customers and clients about their products and
services; to comply with laws and regulations applicable to their
products and services; and to maintain their accounting and finances.
Construction and manufacturing projects entail the coordination of
dozens, hundreds, or thousands of parties---all of whom must have a
justifiable confidence in the information they are sharing and relying
upon.

**[Contextualized, reliable, trustworthy information is as important to
the thinking of human beings as clean air is to human breathing. Human
beings depend on good information for making informed decisions about
political candidates standing in elections; to know as consumers which
specific products and services will best serve their needs; for managing
their finances; in making health-related decisions]{.underline}** about
themselves and their loved ones; **[in learning to perform their
jobs]{.underline}** more effectively or efficiently; **[and
in]{.underline}** truly **[countless other ways.]{.underline}**

**[Nations also engage extensively in information
production.]{.underline}** They provide **[education for young people;
support scientific research that undergirds economic growth and
prosperity; and collect, curate, and disseminate large-scale statistical
data that influence decisions at every level of society]{.underline}**.

Imagine what life would be like **[if citizens could not count on the
validity and trustworthiness of the information underlying any of these
activities]{.underline}**. In some cases, the result would be no more
than minor annoyance. In others, however, **[the result could be
life-threatening.]{.underline}** **[Nations could be crippled, as
they]{.underline}** could and **[likely would make bad]{.underline}** or
at least suboptimal **[decisions about war and peace, the economy, law
enforcement, housing, food production, energy, and the many other
important matters for which governments have some
responsibility.]{.underline}**

### Contention 3 -- Democracy

#### Disinformation undermines trust in government -- it is the greatest threat to liberal democracies

Executive Summary

On November 2, 2020, the Ottawa Citizen ran the front-page headline
"Canadian Military Wants to Establish New Organization to Use Propaganda
and Other Techniques to Influence Canadians." This seemed an
unbelievable story, and one initially denied by a spokesperson for the
minister of National Defense. Just three days later, though, then-chief
of the Defense Staff (CDS) Gen. Jonathan Vance shuttered the group in
question, terminating an initiative more than five years in the making
that called into question the Department of National Defense's (DND)
commitment to objective and appropriate public communication, at a time
when truth decay, **[misinformation and disinformation have gained much
traction around the world and in Canada. In June 2021,]{.underline}**
the day Parliament adjourned for the summer, DND acknowledged to select
media that acting CDS Lt.-Gen. Wayne Eyre and then-deputy minister Jody
Thomas had determined the initiative was "incompatible" with government
communications policy and the vision, mission and principles of DND
Public Affairs. In a surprising self-indictment, the **[leaders also
admitted a lack of "institution-wide strategic level direction and
guidance," to build information-related capabilities that were "governed
by appropriate authorities and oversight.]{.underline}**" Deliberate
**[influence campaigns by malign state, non-state and increasingly by
domestic actors to disturb, disrupt and create disorder in democratic
societies have become widespread and commonplace. The volume of vitriol
is increasing. This is fast eroding citizen faith, trust and confidence
in government and public institutions and may be the greatest
contemporary threat liberal democracies face]{.underline}** -- arresting
this trend and then restoring trust, the ultimate challenge. National
Defense's entire program -- to be successful on operations; secure
sufficient funding; recruit, train and retain; effect culture change;
reconstitute the force post-pandemic and procure the equipment needed to
contest, confront and defeat adversaries -- will largely depend on
whether the institution can modernize its approach to strategic
communications to maneuver more agilely and to better effect in a
complex, frenetic and hostile information environment. Recently,
National Defense has suffered a significant self-inflicted setback in
that regard.

**[Technological innovation has also brought about another set of

**[political repression and authoritarian strengthening---something that

might have opened the door for another set of technological advances

and regimes.58 **[The combination between surveillance, massive troves
of data and technologies that make its processing faster and enable the
manipulation of the information space will be part of the future in ways
that are hard to anticipate.]{.underline}**

combination of known disinformation tactics, existing means of
communication and social media platforms, and rapid innovations in this
space]{.underline}**---including migrating between different social
platforms and an increased use of encrypted communication platforms.
Analysis of the Russian Main Intelligence Administration's (GRU)
operations since 2014 do not show significant technological leaps59 and
similarly in the case of China, existing disinformation and propaganda
capabilities are only enhanced by technology, but not necessarily
defined by new technologies.60 **[The main threat of disinformation
stems from its use in conjunction with other tactics like political
corruption, use of proxies and unwitting allies, deceit, and human
intelligence]{.underline}**.61

**[China in particular presents a growing threat, the magnitude and

disruption of the free flow of information and possible major value
shifts in global public opinion with long-term implications for
democratic values, institutions, and security.]{.underline}**

**[There is enough evidence to draw the conclusion that joint democracy
does cause peace, and that the dyadic democratic peace is a
law]{.underline}**. **[None of the spuriousness critiques, though
intriguing, have sufficiently withstood scholarly rebuttals to justify
dismissing as spurious the very strong correlation between joint
democracy and peace]{.underline}**, especially given the experimental,
case study, and other quantitative observational work that provide
support for different elements of the democratic peace argument. That
said, the spuriousness critiques suggest possible modifications of the
law of the democratic peace, such as perhaps that the democratic peace
could be weaker in less-developed regions. Regarding the causal arrow
thesis, though there is evidence that peace may cause democracy as well
as democracy causing peace, the evidence is much weaker that peace
causes democracy but not vice versa. Further, the claim that peace
causes democracy but not the reverse contains theoretical
inconsistencies.

That said, it is of course conceivable that future studies may emerge
that cast decisive doubt on the proposition that democracy causes peace.
Data collection in international relations is never going to be as
decisive in supporting or refuting theory as data collection in fields
like physics or chemistry, where highly precise, often non-probabilistic
theory permits point predictions that can be tested many times in
controlled laboratory settings. It also will not be as decisive as data
collection in the medical sciences, where theories are probabilistic but
experiments can be conducted on thousands of subjects and repeated
dozens of times. **[That said, the evidence that dyadic democracy causes
peace is as strong as the evidence supporting essentially any
theoretical proposition in international relations, other than
relatively trivial propositions such as that adjacent states are more
likely to fight each other than nonadjacent states]{.underline}**.
Echoing his 1989 assessment, Levy (2013, p. 587) remarked that in
international relations "no one has identified a stronger empirical
regularity" (Levy, 2013, p. 587). **[That is, if the dyadic democratic
peace is not a law, it's as close to a law that we have in international
relations, and probably as close to a law as we are ever going to
see.]{.underline}**

Even accepting that neither cluster of critiques dislodges the
conclusion that democracy cause peace, the inescapable conclusion is
that we live in a complex, multi-causal world. As the democratic peace
advocates themselves have long recognized, many factors beyond democracy
cause peace (Russett & Oneal, 2001). **[Democracy and peace likely
mutually cause each other.]{.underline}** Further, as Kant envisioned,
this variety of factors each cause each other. Development may cause
peace, but democracy also causes development (Przeworski et al., 2000).
**[Gender equality and democratization are likely tightly connected in
complex ways.]{.underline}** Future empirical work using observational,
experimental, and case study methods should continue to unpack and
describe this web of complex and important relationships.

### Contention 4 -- Alliance Cohesion

#### Must act now to prevent disinformation -- Disinformation magnifies all impacts -- it is a force magnifier, spoiler and entangler -- undermining democratic institutions, deterrence, and NATO cohesion

Disinformation, fake news and---since the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in
2020---"infodemics" have been added to the vocabulary of societies
across the world. Often conflated with other terms including
misinformation, tainted leaks, and propaganda, **[disinformation is the
use of false or manipulated information to distort the truth, weaken
trust, and undermine democratic discourse and practices. It has become a
catch-all for information manipulation operations and has fundamentally
altered the way we view geopolitical competition, warfare, and
security.]{.underline}**

**[For NATO,]{.underline}** a defensive military alliance based on
collective defense---"an attack against one is an attack against
all"---**[disinformation has until recently been rarely discussed, much
less considered. Article 2 of the North Atlantic Treaty, however,
underscores that "peaceful and friendly international relations" come
not from military strength alone, but strong and free member state
institutions and an understanding of the principles behind
them.]{.underline}**1 **[Disinformation, which is part of broader malign
influence operations, directly threatens these principles and
institutions]{.underline}**. **[Its acceleration in recent years has
brought disinformation onto the transatlantic agenda.]{.underline}**

**[In the coming decade, NATO is likely to face an increasingly complex
and contested strategic environment. Disinformation will lurk as a
force-multiplier, spoiler, and entangler.]{.underline}** **[Russia and
China have demonstrated willingness to deploy non-military means against
NATO and could intensify the use of disinformation with the benefit of
emerging technologies.]{.underline}** **[At the operational
level]{.underline}**, **[disinformation could increasingly probe and
erode NATO's defense and deterrence]{.underline}**. **[At the strategic
level, long-term information operations and narratives skeptical
of]{.underline}** **[NATO's enduring purpose could weaken solidarity and
cohesion. To protect its political center-of-gravity, NATO should
crystallize where disinformation fits among the multiplicity of threats
likely facing the Alliance in the emerging security environment and then
further evolve its approach to countering disinformation.]{.underline}**

The Threat of Disinformation

**[Disinformation is used strategically to challenge the very
foundations of liberal democracy and of transatlantic relations by
affecting political decision-making, societies, and the very functioning
of democratic institutions.]{.underline}** **[Political warfare and
disinformation allow authoritarian regimes to present the authoritarian
governance model---and]{.underline}** during COVID-19 **[its crisis
management---as a superior alternative to democracy]{.underline}**.2
Given the magnitude and resources of their state-owned media operations
and global ambitions, **[Russia and increasingly China are the most
prominent authoritarian adversaries]{.underline}** for the transatlantic
Alliance.3 **[But the use of disinformation is proliferating among a
multitude of state and nonstate actors, including]{.underline}** most
notoriously the Islamic State (**[ISIS]{.underline}**). US law
enforcement agencies noted in a report about foreign interference in the
2020 elections that **[Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba are also present in
this space, as well as other nonstate actors like
Hizballah]{.underline}**.4 Worryingly, various actors within democratic
societies and NATO members are also turning to disinformation and
information suppression to advance their political goals domestically.5
A prominent tool of political warfare during the Cold War---Soviet
campaigns of "active measures" and dezinformatsiya6---**[propaganda and
disinformation went under the radar for the better part of the past 30
years in the West. The Kremlin's military aggression]{.underline}** in
Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea **[in 2014]{.underline}**
**[revealed Russia's use of information as a weapon, amplified and
strengthened by modern technologies, social media, and a revamped
state-media apparatus.]{.underline}** **[Disinformation campaigns became
a central tool for denying, justifying, and supporting its actions in
Ukraine. It created an alternate reality meant not only to obscure
Russia's involvement, but also to completely discredit theidea of
factuality, truth, and trust in the possibility or mere existence of
facts ("implausible deniability")]{.underline}**.7 **[This became a core
tactic for the Kremlin's power projection in Europe]{.underline}** and
particularly in former Soviet or satellite states. The attempt by
pro-Kremlin actors to influence **[the 2016 US election was another
turning point. It revealed the vulnerability of consolidated democracies
and the irrelevance of geography when it comes to new modes of political
warfare.]{.underline}** **[Disinformation and other means of malign
influence build over time, prey on local conditions, prime audiences for
future attacks and are mobilized at crucial moments]{.underline}** such
as elections, requiring significant resources to investigate and uncover
them. **[Disinformation is deployed as a force multiplier, part of a
toolkit of malign influence tactics to ensure the success of broader
strategic aims.]{.underline}**8 **[These can be military operations,
such as Russia's war against Georgia]{.underline}** and Ukraine or its
intervention in Syria, **[or intelligence operations,]{.underline}**
such as the Skripal poisoning case in the United Kingdom, whereby the
Kremlin sought to provide a cover for its unlawful incursion on UK
territory in a cloud of disinformation and competing narratives.
**[During the first peak of the COVID-19 crisis, the use of
disinformation, propaganda, and coordinated digital deception by both
Russia and China went hand in hand with so-called 'mask diplomacy,' a
media strategy accompanying the delivery of medical supplies by Russia
and China to Europe]{.underline}**.9 **[These information operations
were meant to highlight the]{.underline}** European Union **[(EU) and
NATO's lack of solidarity with their members and incapacity to act
swiftly and effectively]{.underline}**. China also branded a new, more
aggressive approach to engaging with Western counterparts---so-called
'wolf-warrior diplomacy'---both in official communication and by
leveraging its state media and an increased social media presence.10

**[Disinformation has become a weapon to undermine and potentially
distort the outcomes of democratic elections, introduce wedges in the
transatlantic alliance, deepen public health crises, and change the
nature of conflict.]{.underline}** Thus, **[the salience of
disinformation has grown exponentially]{.underline}** among researchers,
civil society, and policy makers in civilian and military structures
alike. **[Increasingly, military structures are]{.underline}**
**[starting to incorporate countering disinformation in their
strategies11]{.underline}** **[because ambiguity and masked intentions
could negate readiness and delay reinforcement.]{.underline}**12
**[Supranational structures like the EU, NATO, and G-7 also have
dedicated programming on tackling disinformation.]{.underline}** With
this, **[it has become a pressing national and transatlantic security
threat and poses a long-term existential challenge to the values and
principles underpinning the North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}**.

#### A strong NATO is the cornerstone of global stability

**Burns, Harvard Kennedy School Practice of Diplomacy and International
Relations Roy and Barbara Goodman Family Professor, 18**

(Nicholas, 9-5-2018, Belfer Center for Science and International
Affairs, \"Assessing the Value of the NATO Alliance\",
https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/assessing-value-nato-alliance,
accessed on 7-8-2022, SR)

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Menendez, you have asked for an assessment of
NATO's value to the United States. In my judgment, [NATO continues to be
of vital importance]{.underline} [to American security]{.underline}
interests in five principal ways. First, [NATO is at the
core]{.underline} [of one of the most significant foreign policy
accomplishments]{.underline} [in American history]{.underline}---[the
creation of a long-term peace in Europe]{.underline} following the close
of the Second World War. [Because of NATO]{.underline} and the emergence
of the European Union, [Europe is united]{.underline} [after centuries
of division and war]{.underline}. [NATO's military strength has been a
major reason]{.underline} [for the absence of war]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} the Soviet Union and [Russia]{.underline} since 1949.
A recent Atlantic Council study reminds that America spent 14.1 percent
of its GDP on defense during the First World War, 37.5 percent during
the Second World War and 13.2 percent during the Korean Conflict. We
spend nothing close to those levels now in large part due to the great
power peace we have enjoyed for over seventy years. NATO has been a
major factor in that peace. And due to the expansion of NATO and the
European Union eastward after the fall of the Soviet Union, millions of
East Europeans now live in free, democratic societies---a significant
success for U.S. diplomacy. Second, [NATO delivers]{.underline}
additional [benefits to]{.underline} U.S. [military objectives and
operations]{.underline} beyond our shores. [NATO is at the heart of our
defense]{.underline} [of North America]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[Europe]{.underline} [from nuclear and conventional
threats]{.underline}. British and French nuclear weapons join ours in
deterring aggression in the North Atlantic area. Since the late 1940s,
every Administration has believed that [the best way]{.underline} [to
defend our country is through American forces forward deployed in Europe
with the NATO allies]{.underline}. [This strategy remains right for
today given Russia's invasion of Georgia]{.underline} in 2008, [of
Crimea and Eastern Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014 [and its current
pressure on Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland]{.underline}. [NATO
remains our primary vehicle for deterring Putin]{.underline} in Eastern
Europe. The [NATO allies host a great number of critical bases for U.S.
forces]{.underline}---Ramstein in Germany, Aviano in Italy, Rota in
Spain, Souda Bay in Greece and Incirlik in Turkey---[that serve as a
platform]{.underline} [for our presence in Europe, as well as for U.S.
force projection against terrorist groups]{.underline} [in North Africa
and the Middle East and for]{.underline} our [continued military
operations in Afghanistan]{.underline}. [Europe is a critical
link]{.underline} [in the development of our Ballistic Missile Defense
network]{.underline} focused on the Middle East with Turkey, Romania,
Poland, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK and other
allies all hosting elements of this system. [NATO allies]{.underline}
continue to [participate in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic
State]{.underline} in the Middle East. [Many of the allies play lead
roles]{.underline} [in]{.underline} other [counter terror
operations]{.underline} [such as French forces in Mali]{.underline}
supported by the U.S. In Afghanistan, the [NATO allies remain with us in
combat operations and in training the Afghan military]{.underline}. Over
1000 soldiers from European and other partner nations have died there
during the last seventeen years. [NATO continues to maintain the
hard-earned peace in Kosovo]{.underline} [with European troops bearing
the large share of the burden]{.underline}. An EU-led force has taken on
all of the peacekeeping responsibility in Bosnia, freeing up the U.S.
for other activities. Third, [the NATO allies are among our closest and
most supportive global partners as we confront the great transnational
challenges]{.underline} that define this century---[the fight against
terrorism, the entire complex of cyber threats, climate change, the risk
of pandemics, mass migration]{.underline} [and others]{.underline}. The
[NATO allies]{.underline} and our partners in the European Union [act
together]{.underline} with us on these and other issues. [This is of
incalculable benefit]{.underline} [to the U.S]{.underline}. [Neither
Russia nor China have treaty allies]{.underline}. [NATO is a significant
advantage]{.underline} [for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[when it acts as a force multiplier for American interests]{.underline}.

### Contention 5 -- Solvency

#### Plan

The United States federal government should substantially increase
coordinated cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on
proactive and system-wide counter-disinformation cyberspace initiatives.

#### Plan solves -- Broadening NATO mandate to integrate proactive and coordinated counter disinformation policy system-wide key to reducing disinformation risks

**[Encourage greater alignment of national and NATO-level information
policy.]{.underline}**

**[Article 3]{.underline}** of the North Atlantic Treaty **[states that
Allies should "maintain and develop their individual and collective
capacity to resist armed attack]{.underline}**,"65 **[which should
include countering malign influence and disinformation]{.underline}**.
**[NATO should create a more cohesive definition of information
operations, of which disinformation is a key element, their potential
impact, and their role within NATO's understanding of conflict to
provide the political impetus for member states to align national
security concepts. NATO could create a reporting mechanism for Allies to
share developments]{.underline}** or publicize progress in addressing
disinformation at each NATO summit. **[The overarching goal is for the
North Atlantic Council to become a more frequent forum for consultation
on national information policy, thereby creating a more united strategic
communications front and enhancing coordination of national and
multinational efforts to counter disinformation. NATO should also
increase intelligence-sharing---which now occurs primarily between
national intelligence services]{.underline}**66---**[and mainstream
national responses based on shared best practices]{.underline}**.
Updating the Strategic Concept to reflect these priorities could
encourage closer alignment of national information policy.

**[The Alliance should also expand and integrate the political mandates
of NATO divisions and departments focusing on emerging security
challenges, including disinformation. Increasing internal coordination
would harmonize its organizational approach]{.underline}**. **[NATO
could borrow from its approach to hybrid and in particular cyber
security threats, as in the Emerging Security Challenges
Division]{.underline}** (ESCD) **[and include disinformation and
influence operations among other emerging threats.]{.underline}**
**[This would first and foremost signify that threats to information
integrity would be elevated to the same importance as other types of
hybrid aggression]{.underline}**. As in the cyber domain,67 NATO should
maintain a degree of ambiguity about whether disinformation constitutes
an attack on the Alliance.

While NATO's Public Diplomacy Division (PDD) coordinates Alliance-wide
communications, **[NATO needs to develop a more coherent internal
mechanism that deals with information operations at a strategic and
policy level. This would be an important step towards equalizing threat
perceptions of disinformation within the Alliance and create a set of
common denominator policies that would create more national information
policy coherence]{.underline}**.

**[Improve proactive, transparent communication to NATO member state
publics.]{.underline}**

**[NATO needs to tell its own story better, prevent malign actors from
shaping the narrative, and adopt a preventative approach to
disinformation that builds on best practices. Disinformation preys on
existing vulnerabilities and opportunistically utilizes events or
crises]{.underline}**. **[NATO activities are transparent and known in
advance (summits, military acquisitions, exercises) so there should be a
preemptive effort to gain a f irst-mover advantage and set the
narrative. This can also include opensource intelligence-gathering using
social media and other technologies to understand the social context and
monitoring how potential target communities attach meaning to or
interpret disinformation narratives]{.underline}**.

**[The Alliance should also publish regular fact-based threat
assessments of the security environment and NATO's efforts to mitigate
them. Public support for NATO generally increases when threats against
the Alliance are readily apparent.]{.underline}** **[The challenge is
that today's unconventional threats are less visible and therefore
perceived as less alarming than for instance conventional or nuclear
threats.]{.underline}** Nonetheless, the Alliance stands at a "strategic
crossroads" and is as relevant as ever.69 **[NATO communication already
alludes to its enduring purpose but regularly publicizing concise,
fact-based threat assessments could help stabilize public
support.]{.underline}** To this end, it could task the NATO Strategic
Communications Center of Excellence (StratCom COE)---an independent
multinational organization supported by seven member states---and
encourage more Allies to support it.

The Alliance should also consider organizing regular ministerials in
Ally capitals other than Brussels. Holding such a prominent
multinational event on a rotating basis across capitals could help
harmonize public perceptions of NATO's enduring purpose across all
member states and increase public engagement particularly where fewer
independent media options exist.

Finally, NATO should develop a more robust measure of public opinion in
member state populations. The effect of disinformation is inherently
difficult to measure. While the EU tracks favorability towards its
institutions and policies through annual Eurobarometer polls, NATO
relies on piecemeal information. The Alliance should consider a new
mechanism to measure public opinion---the Estonian Defense Ministry's
national-level studies70 could provide one model---at regular intervals
combined with other tools to test what might be influencing shifts in
public sentiments.

**[Integrate disinformation into military exercises.]{.underline}**

**[NATO has developed robust public diplomacy efforts around military
exercises in Europe, but hybrid threats, including disinformation and
attempts to influence behavioral outcomes, should be mainstreamed into
regular exercises and simulations. NATO members have already
experimented with some tools at the national level. The UK and the US
militaries are integrating these tools into regular
training]{.underline}**71 **[and joint exercises have included
behavioral science research and embedded experts.]{.underline}**72
However, Allies often resort to bilateral cooperation against
disinformation, often leading to uneven efforts among member states
which need to be fully applied at the Alliance level. NATO should also
regularly exercise scenarios where decision-making is delayed in the
face of an ambiguous or unclear information environment.

**[The Alliance should follow the example of US Army Europe and build
upon or establish disinformation sensor networks to monitor news in real
time]{.underline}**---including potentially viral story
lines---**[during exercises and incorporate response training at the
multinational level. NATO StratCom CoE has developed resources and
knowledge that have already been utilized in military exercises to
expose vulnerabilities. This could become the norm for future
deployments.]{.underline}**73 More broadly, Allies should follow the
example of Norway and recognize that militaries are not omnipresent and
therefore not well-suited to counter emerging threats alone. Folding
civilians into joint training exercises at both the national and
multinational levels could encourage early recognition of operational
ambiguity.74

2019 win, told me in April from a location near Kyiv. "And as such, we
have had eight years to reform."]{.underline}

But while Federov may have helped prepare Ukraine for this moment,
[Russia's relentless efforts to destroy his country --- and its evident
resolve --- mean the country needs further defences. Kyiv requires help
that Western allied governments, including Canada, are in a position to
provide.]{.underline}

[The Kremlin's Global Disinformation Network Russia's propaganda and
disinformation apparatus is extraordinarily complex. Some outlets are
fully state-run, some are merely state-funded, and others are operated
at arm's length by Putin-linked oligarchs.]{.underline} The system
churns out conspiracy theories and whataboutism to aid Moscow's
objectives.

From the start of the all-out invasion on February 24, [Russian
disinformation has thumped on a series of narratives: that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) posed a security risk to the Russian
Federation; that Ukraine was run by neo-Nazis; that Ukraine is
responsible for slaughtering civilians on its own
territory.]{.underline}

Those narratives have, unfortunately, been somewhat effective in
discouraging a unified response from NATO. [They've influenced millions
of Westerners and found purchase with far-right and Russophilic
politicians the world over.]{.underline}

[The most visible Western response to date has been the collective
taking offline of Russia Today, or RT, the state-run television
network.]{.underline}

Yet trying to ban Russian media is a mug's game. Any outlets forbidden
by law or suspended by the social media giants would simply jump to the
Russian-founded social media platform Telegram, which abhors
regulation[.]{.underline}

[Rather than playing whack-a-mole outlet by outlet, Ukraine's allies
would be better off exposing how these disinformation networks work.
Many of these social media pages, self-styled think tanks, blogs and
media outlets are designed to look fully independent and
authentic.]{.underline} Efforts by Twitter, Alphabet and Meta to expose
them as disinformation have been inconsistent. Berlin-based, Moscow-run
video aggregator Ruptly is "state-affiliated media," according to
Twitter, but "state-controlled media" per Facebook; its "transparency"
feature notes that the outlet's page administrators are in three EU
countries, but doesn't name them.

Some smaller but perhaps more effective outlets --- such as the
French-language Donbass Insider, which has used manipulative practices
to spread Kremlin disinformation on its Facebook page --- carry no
disclaimer at all.

Plenty can be done to identify and expose who runs these propaganda
outlets. Western intelligence can help shed light on how they interact
and fit in with Russian intelligence efforts. But social media companies
also need to deny their advertising services to these state-controlled
outlets.

"What's the currency of disinformation?" Marko Suprun, a Kyiv-based host
and producer, asked me recently. "AdSense."

Google's advertising platform will hardly make any disinformation agent
rich. But Suprun says it has created "a bit of a cottage industry ---
they make enough money to survive."

If the companies drag their feet --- in particular, those companies that
have suspended operations in Russia but haven't closed up shop entirely
--- moving to publicly shame them could be quite effective, as Kyiv has
shown.

"What we're trying to emphasize is that there are no grey areas here,"
Fedorov told me. ["This is basically as good-versus-evil as it gets. So,
you either choose the path of good, and you stop operations in Russia
and you help fight disinformation. Or you choose the path of evil and
you stay in Russia and you pay taxes, which can, potentially, be used to
fund the army that's murdering civilians."]{.underline}

[For years, NATO has been skittish about deploying its newly beefed-up
cyber capacities, treating such powers as akin to missile strikes or
active warfare. Why Have a Cyber Command if You're Not Going to Use It?
When the Islamic State used its al-Hayat Media Center to recruit
Westerners to its cause, a US-based coalition bombed the group's
propaganda hubs and hacked its websites. Launching airstrikes in Moscow
is obviously not an option.]{.underline} But that doesn't mean NATO
can't take these stations offline. [After all, Russian disinformation
and hacking have targeted democratic systems and added fuel to extremist
movements in the West. Ukraine has already taken the fight to Russia's
doorstep. Aggressive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns have
knocked offline various elements of the Russian state.]{.underline} A
well-trained "IT Army," as Fedorov dubs it, has hacked major state
companies and dumped the personal information of their employees and
operations.

For years, NATO has been skittish about deploying its newly beefed-up
cyber capacities, treating such powers as akin to missile strikes or
active warfare. [Ahead of NATO's upcoming June summit, there are calls
to come up with a more flexible policy on cyber operations. Giving
member countries the freedom to target infrastructure used for malicious
cyber or disinformation activity would be a great place to
start.]{.underline}

[In effect, NATO countries should have the flexibility to degrade
Russia's ability to launch information and cyber operations against
Ukraine and the West.]{.underline} That doesn't mean launching an
operation that could be considered an act of war, such as knocking a
power plant offline (something Russia has done both to the United States
and Ukraine). It could mean, however, launching DDoS attacks on Russian
websites, or attempting to spearphish access to a Telegram channel
linked to the Wagner Group, a quasi-private military contractor. Those
operations would be both proportionate and plausibly deniable.

[The West also needs to help Kyiv continue its fight."We, of course,
need communications equipment, mostly satellite equipment --- including,
but not limited to, Starlink terminals," Fedorov told me. "So that we
can basically ensure connectivity whenever we can." And, he says,
although Ukraine has already been given a significant number of
workstations, laptops and tablets, it needs still more.]{.underline}

[Not all Kremlin support originates in Russia. As a 2020 report from the
US Department of State notes, an incredibly useful hub for Russian
disinformation is the Canada-based "Centre for Research on
Globalization."]{.underline} The website, the report notes, boasts a
"large roster of fringe authors and conspiracy theorists \[that\] serves
as a talent pool for Russian and Chinese websites."

Conspiracy theories that pop up on sites like these --- such as the
notion that Moscow is striking Ukraine to destroy US-funded biolabs
similar to the equally fictional ones that other conspiracists claim
gave us COVID-19 [--- have been adopted wholesale by
Moscow.]{.underline}

[Western intelligence agencies are aware, or should be aware, of the
level of involvement these hubs have with the Russian state. That State
Department report is a great first step toward declassifying far more
intelligence than is currently done. Washington and London have started
along that path, but all NATO members should engage --- in both
countering falsehoods and explaining to the world how Moscow creates,
supports and amplifies them.]{.underline}

[Propaganda, manipulation and misdirection have been long-standing
tactics of diplomacy and international competition.]{.underline} [In the
last decade,]{.underline} and especially around the 2016 US Presidential
election, 'fake news' and [disinformation became buzzwords of sorts that
led to a rediscovery of the role of information in political
competition.]{.underline} [The biggest difference between the
traditional and more recent debates on the matter is the digitalization
of information warfare and the subsequent scale, volume and speed
advantages brought by this digitalization. The advent of Information and
Communications Technologies (ICTs) brought about a faster information
exchange medium where traditional gatekeepers like editors, censors or
curators are of secondary importance and often irrelevant.]{.underline}
While in more traditional media forms, broadcast is dependent on the
approval of an intermediary individual or a group, with ICTs and social
media, this approval is often hard to enforce with the sheer scale of
information poured into such media venues. [Although automated content
moderation works in most cases, it can easily be
circumvented.]{.underline}^7^ [With information gatekeepers out of the
way, information becomes disintermediated]{.underline} (reduction in the
use of intermediaries), with information suppliers (citizen journalists

[The disintermediated nature of modern information exchange has rendered
ICTs a conducive ground for misinformation]{.underline} (unintended
spread of false information), disinformation (purposeful creation and
dissemination of false information) and malinformation (deliberate use
of accurate or inaccurate information with the purpose of harming an
individual or people).^9^

### AT -- Russian Disinfo Declining

#### Even when disinfo decreases, can't let our guard down -- vigilance is key to preventing info warfare

**Bushwick, Scientific American associate editor covering technology,
interviewing Edelson, misinformation research & New York University
computer science PhD candidate**, **22** 

\[Sophie & Laura, 3-8-2022, Scientific American, \"Russia's Information
War Is Being Waged on Social Media Platforms\",
<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/russia-is-having-less-success-at-spreading-social-media-disinformation/>
accessed on 6-27-2022 hooch//cs\]

**[Days after Russia invaded Ukraine, multiple social media
platforms---]{.underline}**including Facebook, Twitter and
YouTube---**[announced they had dismantled coordinated networks of
accounts spreading disinformation. These networks, which were comprised
of fabricated accounts disguised with fake names and AI-generated
profile images or hacked accounts, were sharing suspiciously similar
anti-Ukraine talking points, suggesting they were being controlled by
centralized sources linked to Russia and Belarus.]{.underline}**

**[Russia's Internet Research Agency used similar disinformation
campaigns to amplify propaganda about the U.S. election in
2016.]{.underline}** But their extent was unclear until after the
election---and **[at the time, they were conducted with little
pushback]{.underline}** from social media platforms. **["There was a
sense that the platforms just didn't know what to do,"
says]{.underline}** Laura **[Edelson, a misinformation researcher and
Ph.D. candidate in computer science at New York University. Since then,
she says, platforms and governments have become more adept at combating
this type of information warfare]{.underline}**---and more willing to
deplatform bad actors that deliberately spread disinformation. Edelson
spoke to Scientific American about how an information war is being waged
as the conflict continues.

\[An edited transcript of the interview follows.\] How do social media
platforms combat accounts that spread disinformation? These kinds of
disinformation campaigns---where they are specifically misleading users
about the source of the content---that's really easy for platforms to
take action against because Facebook has this real name policy:
misleading users about who you are is a violation of Facebook's platform
rules. But there are \[other\] things that shouldn't be difficult to
take down---that historically Facebook has really struggled with---and
that is actors like RT. RT is a Russian state-backed media outlet. And
Facebook has really struggled historically on what to do with that.
That's what was so impressive about seeing that \[Facebook and other
platforms\] really did start to take some action against RT in the past
week, because this has been going on for such a long time. And also,
frankly, \[social media platforms\] have had cover from governments,
where governments in Europe have banned Russian state media. And that
has given cover to Facebook, YouTube and other major platforms to do the
same thing. In general, banning anyone---but especially banning
media---is not a step anyone should take lightly. But RT and Sputnik
\[another Russia state-backed media outlet\] are not regular media: they
have such a long track record of polluting the information space.

**[What else can be done to fight harmful false information? One of the
things that the U.S. did really well going into this conflict---and why,
at least from a misinformation \[controlling\]
perspective,]{.underline}** the first week went very well---**[is that
the U.S. government was really aggressive with releasing information
about what it knew about the ground realities in Russia and
Ukraine.]{.underline}** **[That was really helpful for creating a space
where it was difficult for the Russians to put out misinformation about
those same things. Because the U.S. government was very forthcoming, it
didn't leave a lot of room; there wasn't an information vacuum that the
Russians could step in and fill.]{.underline}** **[And then the
Ukrainian government has been tremendously savvy in telling the story of
the Ukrainian resistance]{.underline}**. There are definitely times when
it has stepped over the line into propaganda. But in general, **[it has
made sure that the world sees the Ukrainian resistance and the fight
that the Ukrainian people are willing to put up. That \[helps\] people
see what is going on and understand that the people who are there
fighting are real people who, not that long ago, were not fighters. They
were civilians, and now they are defending their country.]{.underline}**

I think **[both of those things are going to be difficult to maintain
over time. But if they are not maintained, then the window for Russian
misinformation will open.]{.underline}** A challenge we are all going to
have to deal with is that this war is not going to be over in the next
few days, but the news cycle cannot maintain this level of focus on
these events. It's shocking to say, but in three weeks' time, you will
have hours go by without thinking about it. And that is when people's
guards are going to go down**[. If someone is trying to spread some kind
of \[disinformation\]---maybe the Russians make up some fake Ukrainian
atrocity or something---that's when the world is going to be susceptible
to that kind of thing.]{.underline}** And that's when we're going to
have to remember all this stuff of "Who was telling you the story? Do we
trust them? How verifiable is this account?" **[This is going to be part
of how conflict is waged going forward. But this is something that is
new for all actors, and everyone is going to have to get used to keeping
up their ground game in the information war, not just in the kinetic
war.]{.underline}**

### AT -- Deepfakes Get Debunked

#### Deepfakes have an impact even if some are poor fakes -- multiple examples prove deepfakes pose a destabilizing theat

**[Since the weeks leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, warnings
have been circulating that Russia might use deepfake videos---convincing
fake videos created with artificial intelligence--- in the surrounding
information war. Perhaps they would use deepfakes to fabricate a pretext
for the invasion, or to have Ukrainian President Zelensky issue an order
to surrender.]{.underline}** With bated breath we waited, but no sign of
deepfakery occurred. **[Then]{.underline}** finally, on March 16---20
days into the invasion and 13 days after Ukraine warned this exact
scenario might happen---**[a deepfake of Zelensky surrendering indeed
appeared, and it was ... unconvincing and obvious.]{.underline}**

The video editing was low-quality, and the voice was noticeably off; few
people seem to have been fooled by it. Not to take any chances, Zelensky
himself quickly addressed the deepfake, leaving no doubt about its
falsity.

**[One is tempted to conclude from this episode that deepfake algorithms
are just not powerful enough yet, that the dreaded moment when deepfakes
wreak havoc in political arenas is still off in the distant future, if
it ever arrives. However, a closer inspection of the past few years
reveals a different story: The destabilizing effects of deepfakes in
politics have already arrived---not in a single widely publicized
scandal or a flood of numerous incidents, but in an ominous trickle of
subtle yet impactful incidents that largely slipped under the
radar.]{.underline}** This **[Zelensky deepfake was quickly put to rest,
but there are other videos from past years whose authenticity is
unclear---even today we don't know whether they are deepfakes or
real.]{.underline}** The difficulty in debunking deepfakes isn't just a
question of technological sophistication.

Three years ago, **[Mother Jones reported a story surrounding Ali Bongo,
the president of Gabon. Bongo was hospitalized for an undisclosed
illness in October 2018. Two months later, the vice president announced
that Bongo had suffered a stroke but was recovering and doing
well]{.underline}**. **[However, other than a few photos and a silent
video released by the government, there were no signs of Bongo during
this time. Speculation proliferated that the officials were lying, that
Bongo was in far worse condition than they admitted---and possibly even
dead]{.underline}**. To **[help allay these concerns, on Jan. 1, 2019,
the government posted to social media a video of President Bongo giving
the customary New Year's address.]{.underline}**

**[But something didn't seem right]{.underline}**.

Bruno Ben Moubamba, **[a prominent Gabonese politician who ran against
Bongo in the previous two elections, claimed the video was a
deepfake]{.underline}**. He argued **[that Bongo's face seemed strangely
immobile and that his eye movements did not appear synchronized with his
jaw movements]{.underline}**. Julie Owono, the international technology
lawyer who brought this Bongo saga to the attention of **[Mother Jones,
noted that Bongo blinked only 13 times during the two-minute video,
which she said was less than half the typical amount. The deepfake
theory rapidly gained a sizable following]{.underline}**. Activists
argued that Gabon's ruling party used deepfake technology to hide
Bongo's dire state of health in order to avoid a special election
mandated by law to occur if the president is unfit to lead.

**[One week after the release of the enigmatic New Year's video, Gabon's
military attempted a coup and explicitly cited the oddness of the video
as evidence that the president was absent and that the government was
lying about it.]{.underline}** The coup failed and the government
retained control, and in August 2019 Bongo finally made his first public
appearance since the stroke.

**[We still don't know whether Bongo's party used a deepfake video to
deceive the public long enough for him to recover---and in doing so
illegally avoided a special election that might have led to his
ouster]{.underline}**. One of the complications is that all the oddities
in the New Year's video that suggest it's a deepfake could also be the
result of Bongo's stroke.

**[This event in Gabon foreshadows one that took place in the United
States a year late]{.underline}**r.

On Oct**[. 2, 2020, just weeks before one of the most important
elections in American history, news broke that President Trump had
tested positive for COVID-19. Questions mounted throughout the day over
the severity of his illnes]{.underline}**s. At 6:31 p.m., **[he tweeted
an 18-second video in which he said that he was heading to Walter
Reed,]{.underline}** but he reassured people that he thinks he is doing
very well.

Just as with Bongo's New Year's address, **[this video looks very
strange. Trump has an uncharacteristically flat affect, motionless
manner, and vacant look in his eyes. Immediately there was talk on
social media of it being a deepfake to hide the dire state of the
president's health.]{.underline}**

This time, suspicion quickly faded as more footage of Trump appeared.
The theory was fully dispelled when he gave a live address upon
departing Walter Reed a few days later. But **[for a brief moment, it
really was hard to know what was going on and what to
believe]{.underline}**. **[The existence of deepfake technology meant
that Trump's 18-second video raised more questions than it
answered]{.underline}**. In hindsight, the things that made the video
appear to be a possible deepfake were likely just a result of the
president being ill and possibly medicated.

Days later, **[Trump's team posted a video of him speaking from the
White House lawn, and once again skepticism arose. Some claimed that it
looked like the background was "glitchy," as though there were a green
screen behind him]{.underline}**. But Slate quickly debunked the doubts.

A few months later, **[another instance of deepfake dystopia occurred,
this time in Myanmar. On Feb. 1, 2021, a military coup officially began
when Prime Minister Aung San Suu Kyi---who in the 2010s played a key
role in transitioning Myanmar from military rule to partial
democracy---was arrested and deposed, along with other members of her
ruling party]{.underline}**. The president of the U.N. General Assembly
called for her immediate release; the U.N. secretary-general said **[the
coup is a "serious blow to democratic reforms in
Myanmar."]{.underline}** Suu Kyi is a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, **[and
while she has received international criticism for her country's role in
the genocide of the Rohingya people and her denial of the atrocities
that were committed, she is a legitimate democratically elected leader;
the military needed to justify the brazen steps it took.]{.underline}**

**[A military-run TV station broadcast a video recording of a detained
former regional chief minister providing a public confession in which he
said he bribed Suu Kyi]{.underline}**. **[This seemed to establish the
military's claims that Suu Kyi is corrupt and violated ethics
laws]{.underline}**. Some claimed **[the minister's voice in the video
doesn't sound like his usual one and noted that the visuals look
strange: his facial movements follow a repetitive pattern and his
expression looks oddly emotionless. To this day, some people suspect it
is a deepfake]{.underline}**, while others believe the unnaturalness
observed in the video is the result of it being a forced confession and
poor teleprompting. **[Once again, we don't know for
sure]{.underline}**. The video is somewhat low-resolution and grainy,
which makes distinguishing between a deepfake and an authentic video
particularly challenging. **[Suu Kyi is currently under military arrest
and facing an array of charges, including
corruption]{.underline}**---which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years
in prison.

What we see in these examples is that the context of a video plays an
enormous role in how difficult it is to determine its authenticity.
**[People speak in a somewhat unusual manner in deepfake videos---but,
as became apparent with both the Trump and Bongo incidents, people also
do so when infirm. The stress of duress, such as the Myanmar official
was experiencing, could also alter one's speech patterns]{.underline}**.
And the resolution of a video matters: the flaws in deepfakes are more
apparent in high-res footage. **[Finally, the political situation
matters. For instance, the Zelensky deepfake was a foolish endeavor not
just because it was too amateur to be convincing---it was easy to debunk
because Zelensky could respond to it.]{.underline}**

Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by this ill-conceived
Zelensky deepfake. **[More difficult deepfake situations have already
occurred in the past and more will surely arise in the
future]{.underline}**.

#### Russian disinfo has multiple audiences -- even if debunked in some places, it may still be confusing others

**[Every day we wake up to new Russian atrocities---and new Russian lies
about those atrocities---in Ukraine.]{.underline}** The latest example
is in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb where retreating **[Russian forces "left
behind dead civilians lining the streets---some with their hands bound,
some with gunshot wounds to the head." The Kremlin quickly issued
denials and claimed the evidence was fabricated]{.underline}**.

After weeks of war, **[much has been written about the success and
failures of Russia's disinformation and propaganda. These tactics, of
course, are not new.]{.underline}** Russia has been running propaganda
campaigns since the Cold War. **[What does feel new is the preponderance
of true information available---and perhaps equally importantly, the
speed at which it spreads]{.underline}**. **[Social media, satellite
imagery, and 24/7 reporting are directly refuting Russian disinformation
in real time]{.underline}**.

**[That news is only reaching some people, however]{.underline}**.
**[It's worth stepping back to consider the various audiences for
Russia's disinformation campaigns and examine where they're working and
where they're not.]{.underline}**

First, where it's not: Ukraine and the West. **[Russia and Putin have
spread a long line of falsehoods about Ukraine. They claimed that
Russian language speakers in Ukraine would welcome a Russian
invasion.]{.underline}** They've denied Ukrainian statehood, claiming
Ukraine has always been part of Russia. **[They said this "special
military operation" was necessary to "liberate" Ukrainians from their
"Nazi leaders]{.underline}**." And with the war underway, **[government
officials now claim Ukrainians, not the Russians, are shooting and
bombing their own people.]{.underline}**

**[None of this is true, of course. These falsehoods fell apart
immediately, both in Ukraine and in the West, largely because true
information won out]{.underline}**. **[The Biden administration released
intelligence that was remarkably accurate in predicting Putin's next
moves]{.underline}**. Social media users in Ukraine have posted videos
documenting the brutal invasion from Russian forces**[. Journalists have
used that evidence, along with satellite imagery and other tools, to
debunk false claims. As a result, foreign audiences can not only see for
themselves what's really happening in Ukraine, but also read the
heart-wrenching stories of citizens caught in the crossfire and fleeing
for their lives]{.underline}**.

**[That leads us to where the disinformation campaigns may be working,
at least for now: Russia, China, and the world beyond NATO, the EU, and
their allies.]{.underline}**

As with Soviet-era propaganda campaigns, **[Putin is trying to seal off
his population from information to control the narrative. Authorities
have shut down independent media and blocked most Western social
media]{.underline}**. For many**[, the only viable option left is
state-controlled media, which pushes Putin's false
narratives.]{.underline}**

**[Reports indicate this is working---at least to some extent. We read
stories of Ukrainians with family members in Russia who don't believe
the war is real]{.underline}**. "**[Every day I send them the necessary
information, but the response is that 'This is some kind of fake
information, that this cannot be the case at all, that no one can or
will shoot at civilians,'"]{.underline}** **[said one Ukrainian woman,
speaking about her sister and cousins who don't believe what's
happening.]{.underline}**

Likewise, **[a recent poll found Russians' support for Putin has
actually increased from 71 to 83 percent since the war started, although
the more repressive a regime, the harder it can be to know what people
are truly thinking.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[a recent study using a
more sophisticated methodology designed to elicit opinions on sensitive
topics found actual support for the war to be 15 percentage points---53
percent vs. 68 percent---lower than reported using traditional survey
methods]{.underline}**. On the one hand, it is interesting that even in
the current climate close to one-third of Russians were willing to
explicitly tell pollsters that they oppose the war. **[On the other,
even with the more sophisticated methods, more than half of Russians
still expressed support for the war, so the fact that many Russians
genuinely support the war should not be discounted -- the phenomenon of
"rallying round the flag" in times of war is a real one]{.underline}**.
**[Either way, true information will be critical to topple this digital
iron curtain and pressure Vladimir Putin to end the war]{.underline}**.

**[We also see evidence of Russia's disinformation narratives spreading
outside of Europe and the Western world. One recent New York Times
story, for example, revealed how China's Communist Party is using
university classes, the media, and videos to push "a campaign that
paints Russia as a long-suffering victim rather than an aggressor and
defends China's strong ties with Moscow as vital]{.underline}**."
Another piece in the New York Times reports on research showing how
**[Chinese state media is directly parroting Russian propaganda talking
points. Beyond China, one study discovered a coordinated network of new,
fake, and hacked Twitter accounts in Africa and Asia sharing pro-Putin
messages.]{.underline}** **[Another study found more than 170 websites
in various languages pushing war disinformation, and NBC recently
reported on Russian disinformation in Latin American media. The extent
to which these messages will resonate outside of the NATO countries and
their allies that are directly supporting Ukraine remains to be seen,
but recent votes at the United Nations show that governments in the
Global South remain much more conflicted about withdrawing support for
Russia, suggesting such campaigns remain important.]{.underline}**

## Information Credibility

### Disinfo Undermines Truth

#### Russian disinformation undermines truth

(David Robert, 3-28-2022, Scientific American, \"Russian Misinformation
Seeks to Confound, Not
Convince\", https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/russian-misinformation-seeks-to-confound-not-convince/, accessed

[Rather than take a side, these campaigns create decision paralysis that
leads to inaction]{.underline}

As war envelops Ukraine, Russian sources have strived to create a miasma
of disinformation about the invasion. [Among ample efforts to distort
reality, the Russian Ministry of Defense asserted recently that
U.S.-backed labs in Ukraine have been developing
bioweapons.]{.underline} Outlandish as this falsehood may be, Fox's
Tucker Carlson gave it credence by arguing that the U.S. government's
response was a "cover-up."

As the Russia-Ukraine war intensifies, so too will the flow of
disinformation. This is an age-old strategy Russia has long history of
employing, and a playbook that others, most notably anti-vaccine
activists, have borrowed from liberally. [Yet, rather than focusing
effort on convincing people of a falsehood, the Russian strategy takes a
tack reminiscent of a strategy long employed by the tobacco industry: to
sow so much doubt about what is true that it sends people into decision
paralysis. Faced with a cacophony of wild and conflicting claims, people
do nothing, unsure of what is right.]{.underline}

Despite constituting only a small part of our media diet,
[disinformation campaigns]{.underline}, in our digital world, [can be
devastatingly effective.]{.underline} We are intrinsically biased
towards information that is emotionally visceral. We afford more weight
to content that frightens or outrages us, with the ability to induce
anger serving as the single greatest predictor of whether content goes
viral. This propels the most visceral, divisive narratives to the
forefront of discourse, creating a sound and fury of passionately
debated claims and counter claims. In that atmosphere, it becomes
increasingly difficult to ascertain what to believe, and easy to abandon
the task of discerning the truth.

If we are not to fall victim to such rank dishonesty, it is crucial now
that we question our sources more carefully than ever before.

Indecision and distraction have long been central to Russia's
dezinformatsiya (disinformation) policy, a term Stalin himself is
credited with coining. While an ancient concept, Russia had by the
imperial age mastered dark obfuscation techniques refined for the era of
mass communication. By the dawn of the Soviet empire, they realized this
potential on an industrial scale, establishing the world\'s first office
dedicated to disinformation in 1923. In the 1960s, the KGB covertly
sponsored American fringe groups, amplifying conspiratorial narratives
about everything from the assassination of president John F. Kennedy to
water fluoridation.

[The goal]{.underline}, as KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin elucidated in
1998, **[was "not intelligence collection, but subversion: active
measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community
alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO, to sow discord among allies,
to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia,
Africa, Latin America\...."]{.underline}**. Operation INFEKTION, a
mid-1980s clandestine effort to spread the myth that AIDS was a
CIA-designed bioweapon, was but one infamous exemplar. While utterly
fictious, it resonated with communities ravaged by HIV and neglected by
the callous indifference of the Reagan administration. Despite Russian
intelligence taking responsibility for this lie in 1992, the legacy of
AIDS denialism persists to this day worldwide.

During the Cold War, the doctrine of "active measures" was the beating
heart of Soviet intelligence. This philosophy of political and
information warfare had wide remit, including front groups, media
manipulation, counterfeiting, infiltrating peace groups and even the
occasional assassination.

And in our media-saturated era, Russia has been, by far,
disinformation's most enthusiastic user. Take the 2016 U.S. presidential
election and the contentious Brexit referendum; Russia appears to have
influenced both via lies and distortions.

But disinformation is not solely confined to geopolitics. By summer
2020, the European Commission identified a concerted Russian drive to
propagate COVID disinformation worldwide. From the outset of the
pandemic, [Kremlin-backed troll farms pushed the narrative that COVID
was an engineered bioweapon, peddling the explosive fiction that 5G
radio frequencies caused the virus---a lie that resulted in dozens of
arson attacks on cell towers worldwide.]{.underline}

There is a dark irony in the observation that conspiracy-minded people
can be weaponized in plots to which they're entirely oblivious. The
enduring popularity of the virus-as-a-bioweapon mantra is a stark
reminder that in the age of social media, such manipulation has become
ever easier and more effective. Perhaps the most odious example of this
is the cynical rise of anti-vaccine propaganda.

The sheer efficacy of vaccination is scientifically incontrovertible,
and after clean water, immunization is the most life-saving intervention
in human history. Despite this, the last decade has witnessed
precipitous drops in vaccine confidence worldwide. The renaissance of
once-virtually-conquered diseases prompted the WHO to declare vaccine
hesitancy a top-10 threat to public health in 2019.

Sign up for Scientific American's free newsletters.

Vaccine hesitancy is a spectrum rather than a simple binary, and
exposure to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories nudges recipients towards
rejection. But critically, [many who decline vaccination are
not]{.underline} dyed-in-the-wool [anti-vaccine zealots, but simply
scared by what they have heard, unsure what to believe.]{.underline} Our
tendency towards the illusory truth effect exacerbates this inertia, as
the mere repetition of a fiction is enough to prime us to accept it,
even if we know it to be false on an intellectual level. While Russia
has often amplified anti-vaccine conspiracy theories to increase
tensions, the anti-vaccine movements exist independently of these
efforts, and are masters at sowing the seeds of doubt with torrents of
conflicting and emotive claims.

This illustrates the grim reality that disinformation has no need for
consistency and zero commitment to objective reality; claims are
frequently contradictory, arguing both sides of the coin in exaggerated
and divisive ways. This ["Russian firehose" model of
propaganda]{.underline} is high-output, contradictory and multichannel.
The stream [encourages us to sleepwalk into apathy, distrustful of
everything. This renders us supremely malleable, and dangerously
disengaged.]{.underline}

When it comes to vaccination, concerned parents often opt to stay with
the devil they know, delaying or even rejecting vaccination rather than
sifting through the symphony of conflicting claims to which they're
subjected. Similarly, the outpouring of fictions about Ukraine, its
president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and the war is designed to overwhelm our
capacity to analyze, inducing us to implicitly accept uncertainty over
aggressor and aggrieved---a manufactured doubt benefitting Russia and
other nations.

**[Conviction is not the chief goal of disinformation; instilling doubt
is.]{.underline}** This is why anti-vaccine activists have been so
successful online, and why Russian troll-farms push ample resources into
hawking lies virtually everywhere. The ubiquity of these fictions gives
them an implicit veneer of legitimacy, fueling polarization and
distrust.

This is the strategy Putin continues to pursue; already Russian
propaganda has tried to paint Ukraine (or NATO / America) as aggressors
with staged disinformation. This has been rendered less effective by the
Biden administration's creative approach of releasing intelligence prior
to the operation. [Across social media, Russian front organizations
still try to induce doubt, efforts that will only intensify as the war
wages on.]{.underline} Truth, the old adage insists, is the first
casualty of war.

### Disinfo Causes Confusion

#### Disinformation attacks seek to destabilize and confuse adversaries during time sensitive events

[The most commonly agreed-upon purpose of disinformation in both
domestic and international politics is to distract, confuse and
demobilize adversaries.]{.underline}^26^ The chain of thought is as
follows: [disinformation seeks to confuse an adversary to such a degree
that even if it is debunked later on, the short-term distraction yields
sufficient strategic payoff for the source of
disinformation]{.underline} ('Attacker') [in the form of demobilizing
and dividing the other side]{.underline} ('Defender'). **[Since
disinformation attempts often get fact-checked and debunked, their
strategic utility is often short-term.]{.underline}**^27^ Therefore,
**[disinformation works best during time sensitive events such as
elections, diplomatic crises, emergencies and natural
disasters.]{.underline}**

In the case of an election, the 'Attacker' attempts to boost the chances
of the friendly candidate and weaken the hostile one in the 'Defender'
country, increasing the likelihood of the friendly candidate getting
elected. If the hostile candidate's victory is inevitable, the purpose
of disinformation becomes weakening the hostile candidate's winning
margin so that their rule becomes more difficult and contested. This
prevents the hostile candidate's ability to focus on the Attacker
country after the election.

In the case of a diplomatic crisis or escalation, the logic works
similar[: by distracting and confusing an adversary, the Attacker seeks
to gain short-term strategic payoff either by reducing the level of
support for the Defender government or its policies, or slow down and
demobilize its current course of action]{.underline}. [In cases of
direct armed conflict, disinformation is used to demoralize, demobilize,
discredit and slow down the adversary's diplomatic and military
efforts.]{.underline}

cyber warfare, aimed at undermining public opinions.]{.underline}

Mariupol as a testimony of atrocities committed by Ukrainian soldiers
against civilians, and who blames the mayor of the city for having
abandoned the people.]{.underline} [The video containing such fake
pieces of information was distributed by the FSB.36 Bot farms, supported
by the Russian state, were also active on social media and distributed
fake news about the war. Not only Russia-based actors have had a huge
part in cyberattacks in this war]{.underline}. [The Belarus APT Group
launched disinformation campaigns (by hacking social media platforms of
high profile Ukrainians)]{.underline} and phishing campaigns with
malware, against "European government personnel involved in managing the
logistics of refugees fleeing Ukraine.

#### Information proliferation can be weaponized by increasing the amount of disinformation and taking advantage of the lack of attention the public gives to where the "information" came from

[Anti-expert speech, fake news as a political weapon, the replication
crisis, relentless health warnings associating cancer with everything we
eat, and the richly documented pathologies of online inattention are all
symptoms of a rising awareness that information is not
benig]{.underline}n (Bawden & Robinson, 2009; Carr, 2011; Eppler, 2015;
Jacoby, Speller, & Kohn, 1974; Schoenfeld & loannidis, 2012; Schwartz,
2004). [A common contributor to each of these problems and the focus of
this article is information proliferation---the capacity to access and
contribute to a growing quantity of information.]{.underline} According
to the International Telecommunications Union (2017), more than 4
billion people are now mobile-broadband users, granting each near
instantaneous power to access, create, and share information. This
represents a 5-fold increase since 2010. Simultaneously, our
technological capacities to store and share information have soared
(Hilbert & Lopez, 2011; van den Bosch, Bogers, & de Kunder, 2016)[. The
result of this proliferation is that information is placed increasingly
under the influence of an attention economy]{.underline} (e.g., Lanham,
2006) [in which a growing number of people influence the evolution of
information by what they pay attention to]{.underline} (e.g., Bakshy,
Messing, & Adamic, 2015; Gentzkow & Shapiro, 2010). 

Herbert Simon (1971) captured the central constraint on this attention
economy when he noted that "information . . . consumes the attention of
its recipients, (p. 40). We are limited in how much information we can
attend to from outside sources (sometimes called the cocktail party
problem; e.g., Conway & Cowan, 2001) and how much information we can
process (e.g., in working memory; Miller, 1956). [Thus, too much
information threatens us with information overload and other pathologies
of attention that have been well- documented elsewhere]{.underline}
(Bawden & Robinson, 2009; Carr, 2011). This articles focuses on a less
well- documented but perhaps more pernicious problem: how
information-rich environments place information under the forces of
cognitive selection, driving the evolution of information much like
other forms of selection drive biological evolution. 

#### Russian mass disinformation uses disinfo to cause confusion and deflect blame for food crisis

**Department of State, 22**

(United States Department of State, \"Russia's Disinformation Cannot
Hide its Responsibility for the Global Food Crisis,\" 6-22-2022,
https://www.state.gov/disarming-disinformation/russias-disinformation-cannot-hide-its-responsibility-for-the-global-food-crisis/,
accessed 7-1-2022) jh

**[Russian President Putin's illegal and unprovoked war against Ukraine
has had catastrophic effects on Ukraine, its neighbors, and people
across the globe. The Kremlin's war in Ukraine has wreaked death and
destruction, killing thousands of civilians , displacing millions ,
making refugees of millions more, and massively damaging civilian
infrastructure . The devastating effects of Russia's aggression have
disrupted Ukraine's economy , which in turn has exacerbated global food
insecurity. Ukraine has long been the "breadbasket of Europe, " feeding
millions of people across the globe. It is a top grain supplier to
dozens of African and Middle Eastern countries. Now, after Russia's
February 24 all out invasion, Ukraine has turned "from a breadbasket to
a breadline, " while the Russian government uses disinformation to
mislead the world about the cause of this crisis.]{.underline}**

**[Food insecurity has risen because of Putin's war of choice. It was
not caused, as the Kremlin claims, by sanctions that the United States
and many other countries have imposed in response to Russia's horrific
aggression against Ukraine. Food insecurity was rising before the
invasion, and Putin's war exacerbated that trend. Russia mined Ukrainian
grain fields, attacked merchant shipping on the Black Sea, and blocked
Ukrainians from exporting their own grain. Russia is also plundering
Ukrainian grain for its own profit, pilfering grain from Ukrainian
warehouses according to credible reports. All these actions have
worsened food insecurity around the world.]{.underline}**

Conversely, the United States and its partners have taken great care to
avoid exacerbating food insecurity. U.S. sanctions, for example, are
specifically written to prevent food insecurity: they include carveouts
for agricultural commodities and permit transactions for the export and
re-export of food to and from Russia, even with a sanctioned individual
or entity. Moreover, the United States has pledged \$2.6 billion this
year in humanitarian food assistance to help alleviate world hunger,
with an added \$5 billion to be added over the next five years.

**[Russia's government officials, Russian state-funded media, and
Kremlin-aligned proxy disinformation actors are attempting to deflect
attention from Russia's responsibility for worsening global food
insecurity by blaming sanctions, "the West," and Ukraine. In fact, the
Kremlin and its proxies' massive disinformation campaign is heavily
targeting the crisis's most heavily impacted regions -- the Middle East
and Africa. These false narratives are amplified by Kremlin-controlled
state outlets such as RT Arabic and RT en Francais , as well as the
People's Republic of China (PRC) state media .]{.underline}**

As it has with past false narratives about bioweapons in Ukraine , the
Russian government's top diplomats and its embassies spread
disinformation, often concentrating on African and Middle Eastern
audiences. Some recent false claims include:

Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called
Russia's blockade of Ukrainian grain "Western and Ukrainian
disinformation ."

In his May 19 United Nations Security Council speech on conflict and
food security, Russia's UN Ambassador Vasiliy Nebenzya accused Europe of
"hoarding" Ukrainian grain and engaging in "grain for weapons "
exchanges with Kyiv.

Russia's embassy in Egypt blamed "illegal unilateral sanctions ," while
Russia's embassy in Zimbabwe claimed "Western interference " in the
Global South.

In his May 25 Africa Day speech, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
attempted to de-legitimize Ukraine and urged African ambassadors in
Moscow to demand the removal of "illegal, anti-Russian" sanctions in
order to strengthen food security.

OneWorld , a website with ties to Russia's military intelligence,
according to U.S. officials, echoed Lavrov's claims, accusing President
Zelenskyy of supporting a U.S.-led "global food cartel " that will wield
control over global food supply as a "new hybrid weapon " against the
Global South.

In his May 26 interview with RT Arabic, Foreign Minister Lavrov accused
the West of neo-colonialism and of blackmailing African and Arab
countries to join "anti-Russia" sanctions, in a bid to build solidarity
against what Russia's propaganda calls the "imperial West ."

This disinformation is intended to both hide Russia's culpability and
persuade leaders of at-risk countries to support an end to sanctions
designed to stop Russia's unjust and brutal war in Ukraine.

**[The Russian government's attempts to deflect responsibility for its
actions by blaming others for the worsening crisis in the global food
system are reprehensible. This crisis is keenly felt in many Middle
Eastern and African countries that import at least half of their wheat
from Ukraine. According to World Food Program, millions of people are at
risk of famine and malnutrition in these regions, as Putin's reckless
war increases the price of bread, taking money from the pockets of the
most vulnerable families. "Russia is solely responsible for this food
crisis ... despite the Kremlin's campaign of lies and disinformation,"
said European Council president]{.underline}** Charles
**[Michel]{.underline}** as Russia's UN Ambassador Nebenzya stormed out
of a June 6, 2022, UN Security Council meeting.

**[The Russian government continues spreading disinformation about its
unjustified war's disastrous consequences, including global food
insecurity. The]{.underline}** Russian government should stop
weaponizing food and allow Ukraine to safely ship out its grain so that
millions of hungry people in the Middle East and Africa can be fed.

**[Disinformation impacts not only the political sphere, but also
economic, social and cultural aspects of life]{.underline}**, from
personal mindsets about vaccinations to disavowing cultures or different
opinions. [Disinformation feeds polarisation and erodes trust both
within institutions and amongst communities]{.underline}. Such
manipulation tactics can damage personal rights to health and education,
participation in cultural life and membership of a community. There are
several economic, social and cultural rights that can be disrupted by
disinformation, such as those included in Article 25(1) UDHR:
'**[Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the
health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food,
clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and
the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness,
disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in
circumstances beyond his control']{.underline}**. Article 12 of the
ICESCR affirms: '1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognise
the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable
standard of physical and mental health.' **[The most prominent recent
example relates to disinformation around COVID-19, which has distorted
freedom of choice even within a health context]{.underline}** (see also
Chapter 4 on COVID-19). Blackbird55, an organisation whose purpose it is
to enhance decision making and empower the pursuit of information
integrity' 56, released studies analysing the volume of disinformation
generated on Twitter as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. In one of its
reports57, **[Blackbird identified one of the disinformation campaigns
unfolding in Twitter as 'Dem Panic']{.underline}**, **[which had the
goal of de-legitimising the Democratic Party in the US for their early
warnings about the coronavirus]{.underline}** and the need to introduce
preventative measures. Downplaying effects of the virus can clearly have
negative impacts on public health. The Lancet warned in October 2020
that the anti-vaccine movement together with digital platforms are
becoming wealthier by hosting and spreading disinformation campaigns in
social media58. It is claimed that 'anti-vaxxers have increased their
following by at least 7·8 million people since 2019' and hence 'the
anti-vaccine movement could realise USD 1 billion in annual revenues for
social media firms'.

#### Russian disinformation discredits politicians and weakens historical and cultural ties to community, weakening institutions. 

**Erlich,** **McGill University Department of Political Science
Assistant, and Garner University of Washington Political Science PhD
Candidate, 21** (Aaron and Calvin, 11-1-2021, SAGE Journals, \"Is
pro-Kremlin Disinformation Effective? Evidence from
Ukraine\", https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19401612211045221#\_i3, accessed
on 7-6-2022, SR)

Our first contribution is to classify and quantitatively measure belief
in various types of pro-Kremlin disinformation statements according to
the topic they cover and the strategic objective they advance. Since
these disinformation campaigns have covered a wide range of events, we
sought to systematically categorize them. Our close reading of
pro-Kremlin disinformation articles leads us to argue for a topic
categorization similar to Meiselman et al. (1987), who wrote of Soviet
disinformation during the Cold War, "[There are basically three types of
disinformation: political disinformation, military disinformation, and
economic disinformation"]{.underline} (33). Indeed, we argue that many
contemporary pro-Kremlin disinformation stories can be grouped into the
three high-level topics Meiselman et al. (1987) identify. [To these
three topics, we add a fourth category, historical/cultural claims or
statements (we label these historical for brevity), which we found
abundant and which did not fit into the three previous categories.
Indeed, we chose these four areas because of their relevance in both
historical and contemporary Russian disinformation efforts.]{.underline}
We present each of these categories, which should apply generally to
pro-Kremlin disinformation, but focus on Ukrainian examples, given our
study is carried out in Ukraine.

[Economic coverage may be a fecund area in which to sow disinformation,
particularly in countries with a history of economic mismanagement such
as Ukraine.]{.underline} Citizens may be susceptible to stories that
disparage the domestic economy because they are accustomed to hearing
true stories of economic mismanagement and corruption. Such
mismanagement has pervaded Ukraine's post-Soviet history (Åslund, 2005)
and continues to plague contemporary Ukraine (Denisova-Schmidt and
Prytula, 2017). **[Citizens may also believe political disinformation in
nascent and noninstitutionalized democracies, such as Ukraine, because
of the weakness of political and democratic institutions]{.underline}**
(Way, 2015). Therefore, similar to the relationship between weakening
political institutions in OECD democracies and increased belief in
disinformation (Bennett and Livingston, 2018), the lack of political
institutional authority makes it more likely that citizens will believe
disinformation about politics. Indeed, Ukrainians often view political
actors as likely to deceive them and engage in unscrupulous behavior
(Chudowsky and Kuzio, 2003, 278). **[As with the economic topic,
disinformation about Ukrainian politicians or governing structures may
sway audiences accustomed to hearing negative news about their
politicians.]{.underline}**

Pro-Kremlin disinformation claims about the military deserve particular
attention in Ukraine. **[Military-related disinformation forms a
recurring part of Russia's global disinformation efforts and was part of
Russian efforts to distract or mislead the international community and
the Ukrainian population in response to Russia's invasion of Crimea and
support for insurgents in eastern Ukraine]{.underline}** (Iasiello,
2017). **[Additionally, Russia has used disinformation aimed at
discrediting NATO and other Western institutions to reduce their allure
within Ukraine]{.underline}** (Lange-Ionatamišvili, 2015). Finally,
Russia has spread falsehoods about the actions of the Ukrainian military
(Khaldarova and Pantti, 2016). Prior research suggests that
military-related disinformation could be highly believable because, as
with rumours, citizens usually do not have firsthand information about a
conflict, and latching onto the disinformation claim can be a mechanism
to cope with anxiety (Greenhill and Oppenheim, 2017).

We also **[find a large quantity of pro-Kremlin disinformation
attempting to taint Ukrainian leaders with unsavory historical or
cultural connections. This type of disinformation leverages the
propaganda technique that Sproule (2001) has classified as
"name-calling" and has been found to be prevalent in other contemporary
propaganda contexts]{.underline}** (e.g., Lakomy, 2020). Russia's use of
"name-calling" in the history topic likely also emerges out what have
been dubbed the "memory wars" (Koposov, 2017). Russian leadership
maintains the Soviet view that Russia was a liberating victor of World
War II that vanquished the Nazis. Therefore, disinformation claims that
fall in the historical topic tend to paint individuals or governments as
having fascist or Nazi connections and attempt to reinforce Russia's
historical propaganda.

Along with varying topics, pro-Kremlin disinformation also appears to
pursue varying strategic objectives. In one analysis, Kragh and Åsberg
(2017) investigate a corpus of 3,963 Swedish Sputnik articles published
in 2015 and find ten strategies, such as sowing "crisis in the West,"
promoting a "positive image of Russia," highlighting "Western
aggressiveness," and others. In a meta-analysis of annual reports from
security services in 11 countries, Karlsen (2019, 10) similarly finds a
common strategy is to blame problems on Western actions. **[In the
Baltic States, common claims focus on the return of Nazism and fascism,
and emphasize Soviet heroism in WWII and NATO aggression.]{.underline}**
We categorize all of these strategies into three types emerging from
both recent scholarship and the literature on Soviet disinformation

The Future is Here

**[Questions about the evolution of the disinformation threat strike at
the core of NATO's political mandate as a military alliance and its
ability to assess and respond.]{.underline}** "Netwar" has changed the
nature of conflict with profound implications for disinformation. The
term was used in 1992 in a prescient analysis by RAND alluding to both
the role that the internet would have in shifting the realities of
conflict and national security, and the way that conflict would morph
into a structure that relied more on networks than strict hierarchies
and command chains.43 **[Disinformation and the more general
manipulation of the information space]{.underline}** (through political,
economic, technological, cyber or social engineering tools) **[have
emerged in the past decade as profound mutations in the way we
understand security. First, online conflicts have merged with offline
conflicts]{.underline}**. **[War is declared online: social platforms
are used to amplify the perception of war or the strength of the enemy,
to recruit combatants and report from the battlefield, while at the same
time creating far deeper divisions that can in fact expand the causes of
war]{.underline}**.44 **["Social media has changed not just the message,
but the dynamics of conflict"]{.underline}** to the extent that
researchers are questioning the very definition of war.45 **[Both ISIS
and Russia offer ample illustrations of how disinformation and digital
manipulation are fully integrated with physical aggression and military
operations.]{.underline}** In the case of Russia, the integration of
information operations with war fighting---the so-called "Gerasimov
doctrine"--- became an important topic for NATO and allied
decision-makers.46 **[Second, disinformation and digital deception are
used in the battle to achieve cognitive and behavioral outcomes in
societies. National militaries are reorienting to also face information
warfare. Significantly, domestic politics has also reordered around the
ability to create and influence (or manipulate) online constituencies.
Political actors in most countries, whether democratic or not, now rely
on troll armies and digital influencing campaigns to alter democratic
processes]{.underline}**.47 **[This shift in domestic political debate
also has an impact on the Alliance's internal functioning. As political
actors in some member states are increasingly utilizing information and
digital manipulation, they are not only departing from principles and
values NATO is built upon]{.underline}** (and clearly outlined under
Article 2 of the NATO Charter) **[but are also creating additional
avenues for malign foreign actors to infiltrate democratic societies and
weaken them from within. Third, authoritarian nations attempt to
polarize and weaken national security structures, diminish trust in
alliances, and thus hamper the cohesion and effectiveness of national
and supra-national defense structures. NATO has been a primary target.
Anti-NATO narratives and conspiracies are an important tool in the
arsenal of digital manipulation campaigns undertaken by pro-Kremlin
groups]{.underline}**. **[NATO is portrayed as an alliance that fosters
insecurity, rather than protect its members. It is depicted as an
extension of the US military-industrial]{.underline}** **[complex, as a
platform for war-mongering elites to demonize Russia and fuel
Russophobia, and as a tool in the hands of bigger, more powerful
democracies to dominate smaller countries and use them as cannon fodder
in case of a conflict.]{.underline}** Defense contractors have also come
under attack by disinformation perpetrators with the aim to discredit
them and deflate public trust in the operations and relevance of these
companies.48 **[Military personnel and particularly NATO troops are
being targeted]{.underline}** during military exercises,49 **[such as
the "Lithuanian Lisa case"]{.underline}** and in Defender 21.50
**[Similarly, adversaries use cyber and information tactics to collect
troves of data over a long period of time that could be used against
military targets or during military operations.]{.underline}**51 **[An
underexplored area is also the impact that disinformation might have on
intelligence collection and sharing. It is unclear whether
disinformation, which targets the integrity of and ability to verify
information, could be altering open-source intelligence gathering or
hampering exchanges between allies, particularly as some domestic actors
engage in disinformation operations themselves. The integrity of the
information space is crucial for equalizing threat perception among
Allies and accurately defining security threats]{.underline}**.

#### Information space is exploited by Russia to continue to spread disinformation

\[Janne & Jazlyn, 6-15-21, NATO Strategic Communications Centre of
Excellence, \"RUSSIA'S STRATEGY IN CYBERSPACE\",
<https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/Nato-Cyber-Report_15-06-2021.pdf>,
p. 5-7, accessed on 7-2-22, MG\]

[Russia's conceptualization of 'information confrontation' and the role
of cyberspace within it is outlined in strategic policy
documents]{.underline}, such as National Security Strategy (2015),
Foreign Policy Concept (2016), Information Security Doctrine (2016),
Military doctrine (2014), Conceptual Views on the Activity of the Armed
Forces in the Information Space (2016), as well as works and
publications by Russian military thinkers.

[From the Russian perspective, cyber warfare or the Russian equivalent
'informationtechnological warfare,'1 is only a part of the overarching
concept of "information confrontation" (informatsionnoe protivoborstvo).
The Russian Ministry of Defence describes the information confrontation
as the clash of national interests and ideas, where superiority is
sought by targeting the adversary's information infrastructure while
protecting its own objects from similar influence.2]{.underline} The
translation of the term informatsionnoe protivoborstvo into English has
proven difficult, and has often incorrectly been translated as
'information warfare'3 ('informacionnaja vojna'), despite the fact that
protivoborstvo refers to 'counterstruggle', 'countermeasure' or
'counteraction' rather than 'warfare'.4 This paper uses the term
'information confrontation' due to its established status in discussions
regarding hostile Russian informational activities[.]{.underline}

[The confrontation includes a significant psychological remit, whereby
an actor attempts to affect informational resources (documents in
information systems) as well as the minds of the adversary's military
personnel and population at large.5 Ultimately, cyber operations (or
informationtechnical means) are one of many methods used to gain
superiority in the information confrontation. Russia, and particularly
Russian President Putin's regime, sees the information confrontation as
a constant geopolitical zero-sum competition between great powers,
political and economic systems, and civilizations.]{.underline}6

Protecting 'Information': Cognitive and Technical Publicly available
Russian doctrines and policy documents do not explicitly reference cyber
operations. Furthermore, Russian documents do not use the term
'cybersecurity', but refer instead to 'information security.' This term
differs from the Western notion of 'information security' (or in short:
infosec) in that it encompasses not only the protection of critical
digital networks, but society's cognitive integrity as well.7 There are
several reasons why Russian military thinkers apply the term 'cyber'
when talking about Western threats and activities, but are reluctant to
link the term to Russia's own capabilities and actions. Some authors
argue that this deliberate choice is related to negative connotations
around Soviet-era 'cybernetics,' as well as the importance the term
'information security' holds for Russia's own domestic politics 8.

When discussing the operational environment, Russia uses the term
'information space' (informatsionnoe prostranstvo), or 'information
sphere' (informatsionnaya sfera), which again is more comprehensive than
the Western concept of 'cyberspace' or 'cyber domain.' The 2016 Russian
Doctrine of Information Security defines the information sphere as: "a
combination of information, informatization objects, information systems
and websites within the information and telecommunications network of
the Internet \[...\], communications networks, information technologies,
entities involved in generating and processing information, developing
and using the above technologies, and ensuring information security, as
well as a set of mechanisms regulating social relations in the sphere".9

The information space refers to activities to form, transform, and store
information, as well as 'influencing individual and public
consciousness, information infrastructure and information itself.'10

According to Ofer Fridman, Russia conceptualizes cyberspace as the
intersection between hardware, software, infrastructure, and content11.
In this framework, the information-technological layer includes
hardware, software and infrastructure, while the
informationpsychological layer includes hardware, software and content.'
Irrespective of the means used -- technological (for example, destroying
digital infrastructure) or psychological (manipulating a message on
social media) -- activities in cyberspace are understood in terms of
their effect in the information space.12 Importantly, Russia perceives
the information space in very geopolitical terms, with their domestic
information space representing a continuation of territorial state
borders, which they view as constantly being violated by foreign
intrusions.13

NATO doctrine understands cyberspace as an operational domain and
considers it as part of the information environment. [This environment
is '\[...\] comprised of the information itself, the individuals,
organizations and systems that receive, process and convey the
information'. The information processed through this environment
provides the base for cognitive processes that affect individual
decision-making and subsequently, behaviour. Those processes happen in
three dimensions -- physical, virtual and cognitive -- and cyberspace
involves all three of them. In this respect, NATO's concept of the
information environment is not that different from Russia's
understanding of 'information space' and the role of cyberspace within
it. Similarly, the Russian concept of 'information weapons']{.underline}
(practically absent in Western parlance) includes more than just digital
measures.14 Although [the Russian Armed Forces vaguely defines them as
"information technologies, means and methods used for the purposes of
waging information war," in practice the concept covers a wide array of
activities (often with an emphasis on affecting the human mind); this
includes the spreading of disinformation, electronic warfare, the
degradation of navigation support, psychological pressure, and the
destruction of adversary computer capabilities.]{.underline}15

Contrary to the Western view of interstate conflict that is based on the
international legal order outlined in international treaty and customary
law (specifically the UN Charter and the Geneva Conventions) that makes
a clear distinction between war and peace, [Russia's 'information
confrontation' is constant and ongoing. This view is exploited by Russia
to undertake activities beneath the threshold of armed conflict,
allowing it to remain unpredictable and pursue strategic objectives
short of causing kinetic conflict.16]{.underline}

A [key goal of Western democracies is to maintain a free, stable and
open Internet, where fundamental rights and freedoms are ensured. In
this regard, 'information security' is perceived as the protection of
data and systems, but not imposing control over the attitudes and
beliefs that the users of those systems are expressing.]{.underline} [At
the same time, the principles of openness and freedom of speech upheld
in Western democracies might be exploited by information and
cyberattacks. Russia seeks to exploit this openness to gain 'information
superiority,' notwithstanding whether it is in a conventional conflict
with its opponents or not.]{.underline}

**[Inconsistent democratic oversight of platforms and other media
entities allows disinformation campaigns to leverage algorithmic
gatekeeping and opportunities for viral amplification to distribute
false claims.]{.underline}** **[The amplification and transmission of
misleading claims across sites may undermine a deliberative system's
epistemic function because even incidental exposure can increase the
probability of belief in false information]{.underline}** (Feezell 2018;
Pennycook, Cannon, and Rand 2018). **[These tactics can be seen in
Russian campaigns that promote pseudoscientific conspiracies on vaccines
and other issues]{.underline}** (Broad 2020; Broniatowski et al. 2018;
DiResta et al. 2018, 69). **[Simply examining the balance of true and
false claims may not capture the full range of epistemic
harm]{.underline}** (Starbird, Arif, and Wilson 2019, 18--19).
**[Disinformation actors]{.underline}** not only propagate false and
deceptive claims, they often **[seek to crowd out or devalue
contributions from processes or institutions of higher epistemic
quality]{.underline}** (Hagen et al. 2020; Krafft and Donovan 2020). For
instance**[, Russian disinformation actors routinely spread false news
stories and attack professional journalism organizations]{.underline}
(DiResta et al. 2018, 66--67; U.S. Senate 2019, 20--21); [they also
disparage science agencies while amplifying pseudoscientific
conspiracies]{.underline} (Broad 2020; Broniatowski et al. 2018). [These
efforts built on increasing distrust of news media and institutions of
expertise in the United States]{.underline}, particularly on the right
(Mitchell et al. 2019). Research suggests [that false claims are more
likely to gain traction in a system where there is antipathy toward
intellectuals, expert consensus, and scientific
institutions]{.underline} (**Stecula, Kuru, and Jamieson 2020).

#### Internal Link -- Disinformation is used to create fake institutions that deck the credibility of legitimate institutions.

\*This card indites why we have become less trustful of journalists as
qualified authors in debate. It also explains how we have become so
concerned about disinformation that we disengage from news entirely.

[In addition to attacking the credibility of institutions that claim
higher epistemic quality, such as news outlets and think tanks, Russian
disinformation campaigns also create faux versions of these
institutions, which can promote competing claims on issues]{.underline}
(Broad 2020). [This tactic has long been used by "merchants of doubt" to
sew confusion about climate change or the health risks of
tobacco]{.underline} (Oreskes and Conway 2011) but [is made easier by
the problem of "source blindness" on social media]{.underline} (Pearson
2020). [The proliferation of competing claims can contribute to the
belief that truth claims, including expert claims, are largely dictated
by political commitments. This cultivation of epistemic cynicism has
been identified as part of the Russian government's "firehose of
falsehood" propaganda strategy, which promotes the belief that it is
fruitless to seek true accounts of political matters in a media
environment replete with conflicting and false claims]{.underline} (Paul
and Matthews 2016; U.S. Senate 2019, 16). [Online disinformation appears
to pose a greater risk than previous attempts at overwhelming citizens
with conflicting information due to the possibility of coordinated or
algorithmic dissemination of content across platforms]{.underline}
(Krafft and Donovan 2020; Wardle and Derakhshan 2017). [False and
conflicting stories can appear on many different sites and social media
pages, creating a situation where individuals conclude, "I don't know
what to believe"]{.underline} (Toff and Nielsen 2018, 649--52). Polling
has not only found that [concerns about false news are pervasive among
Americans]{.underline}, but [it has prompted a substantial portion (42%)
to reduce their information-seeking and simply consume less
news]{.underline} (Mitchell et al. 2019).

**[Corruption of the information ecosystem has become an existential
threat to civilization as we know it because prosperity and advancement
depend on a secure information infrastructure and environment that
provides human beings with contextualized, reliable, trustworthy
information when and where it is needed. Information is as much a part
of human ecology]{.underline}** and the essence of being human as DNA
(itself a form of information!) is a part of the evolutionary processes
in biological systems.

Today, **[chaos reigns in much of the information ecosystem on which
societies depend. In many forums for political and societal discourse,
national leaders shout about fake news, by which they mean information
they do not like. These same leaders lie shamelessly, calling their lies
truth, or perhaps "truthful hyperbole." Acting across national
boundaries, these leaders and their surrogates exacerbate existing
divisions, creating rage and diminishing confidence in elections and
democratic institutions. Using unsupported anecdotes and sketchy
rhetoric, denialists undermine well-established science about climate
change and other urgent issues. Established institutions of the
government, journalism, and education---institutions that have
traditionally provided stability---are under attack precisely because
they have provided stability.]{.underline}**

Evolving Challenges

**[Technological advances tend to be front and center in the discussion
about the future of disinformation and digital manipulation.
Deepfakes]{.underline}** (manipulated audiovisual content), artificial
intelligence **[(AI), and natural language processing]{.underline}**
(NLP), **[and their timeline and potential deployment by malign actors
are among the potential threats]{.underline}** that researchers have
been trying to understand. **[Synthetic online activity has already been
piloted by malign actors in different ways online, most notably by
Russia's use of completely fake journalist personas who were getting
published by different online news outlets]{.underline}**.52 **[This is
a warning of things to come once this technology becomes available and
cheap enough for a wider set of malign actors to use.]{.underline}**53
**[There is also the risk of unintended consequences with new
technologies]{.underline}**---for example, NotPetya **[malware
unexpectedly boomeranged back to Russia and led to billions of dollars
of economic loss worldwide. Similar unanticipated scenarios could occur
with the rise of technology-backed influence operations, including by
weaponizing the discourse around them, which]{.underline}** **[further
weakens trust in sources of information and creates additional burdens
to prove authenticity]{.underline}**.54

#### Widespread deepfake technology provides a new way to spread disinformation throughout the public media, and can be utilized by anyone for malicious use

**Fowler, Washington Post Technology columnist, 21**

\[Geoffrey A., 3-25-21, Washington Post, "Anyone with an iPhone can now
make deepfakes. We aren't ready for what happens next,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/25/deepfake-video-apps/,
accessed 7-1-2022, LASA-LR\]

**[I've made George Washington sing disco and Marilyn Monroe blow me a
kiss]{.underline}**. With just a photo and an iPhone app, I can create a
video of any face saying, or singing, whatever I want.

And now so can you. **[The technology to create "deepfakes" --- videos
of people doing things that never really happened --- has arrived on
smartphones. It's simple, fun ... and also troubling.]{.underline}**

The past few months have brought advances in this controversial
technology that I knew were coming, but am still shocked to see. A few
years ago, deepfake videos --- named after the "deep learning"
artificial intelligence used to generate faces --- required a Hollywood
studio or at least a crazy powerful computer. **[Then around 2020 came
apps, like one called Reface, that let you map your own face onto a clip
of a celebrity.]{.underline}**

**[Now with a single source photo and zero technical expertise, an
iPhone app called Avatarify lets you actually control the face of
another person like a puppet]{.underline}**. Using your phone's selfie
camera, whatever you do with your own face happens on theirs. Avatarify
doesn't make videos as sophisticated as pro fakes of Tom Cruise that
have been flying on social network TikTok --- but it has been downloaded
more than 6 million times since February alone. (See for yourself in the
video I made on my phone to accompany this column.)

Another app for iPhone and Android devices called Wombo turns a
straight-on photo into a funny lip-sync music video. It generated 100
million clips just in its first two weeks.

And MyHeritage, a genealogy website, lets anyone use deepfake tech to
bring old still photos to life. Upload a shot of a long-lost relative or
friend, and it produces a remarkably convincing short video of them
looking around and smiling. Even the little wrinkles around the eyes
look real. They call it "Deep Nostalgia" and have reanimated more than
65 million photos of people in the past four weeks.

**[These deepfakes may not fool everyone, but it's still a cultural
tipping point we aren't ready for. Forget laws to keep fakes from
running amok, we hardly even have social norms for this
stuff.]{.underline}**

All three of the latest free services say they're mostly being used for
positive purposes: satire, entertainment and historical re-creations.
**[The problem is, we already know there are plenty of bad uses for
deepfakes, too.]{.underline}**

"It's all very cute when we do this with grandpa's pictures," says
Michigan State University responsible-AI professor Anjana Susarla.
"**[But you can take anyone's picture from social media and make
manipulated images of them. That's what's concerning."]{.underline}**

So I spoke to the people making deepfake apps and the ethics experts
tracking their rise to see if we can figure out some rules for the road.

"You must make sure that the audience is aware this is synthetic media,"
says Gil Perry, the CEO of D-ID, the tech company that powers
MyHeritage's deepfakes. "**[We have to set the guidelines, the
frameworks and the policies for the world to know what is good and what
is bad."]{.underline}**

The technology to digitally alter still images --- Adobe's Photoshop
editing software --- has been around for decades. But deepfake videos
pose new problems, like being weaponized, particularly against women, to
create humiliating, nonconsensual fake pornography**[.]{.underline}**

How to spot a fake video

In early March, a woman in Bucks County, Pa., was arrested on
allegations she sent her daughter's cheerleading coaches fake photos and
video of her rivals to try to get them kicked off the squad. Police say
she used deepfake tech to manipulate photos of three girls on the
Victory Vipers squad to make them look like they were drinking, smoking
and even nude.

**["There's potential harm to the viewer. There's harm to the subject of
the thing. And then there's a broader harm to society in undermining
trust]{.underline}**," says Deborah Johnson, emeritus professor of
applied ethics at the University of Virginia.

**[Social networks say deepfakes haven't been a major source of
problematic content. We shouldn't wait for them to become
one.]{.underline}**

**[It's probably not realistic to think deepfake tech could be
successfully banned. One 2019 effort in Congress to forbid some uses of
the technology faltered.]{.underline}**

But we can insist on some guardrails from these consumer apps and
services, the app stores promoting them and the social networks making
the videos popular. And we can start talking about when it is and isn't
okay to make deepfakes --- including when that involves reanimating
grandpa.

#### Deepfakes have an impact even if some are poor fakes -- multiple examples prove they erode truth and the ability to verify information

**[Since the weeks leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, warnings
have been circulating that Russia might use deepfake videos---convincing
fake videos created with artificial intelligence--- in the surrounding
information war. Perhaps they would use deepfakes to fabricate a pretext
for the invasion, or to have Ukrainian President Zelensky issue an order
to surrender.]{.underline}** With bated breath we waited, but no sign of
deepfakery occurred. **[Then]{.underline}** finally, on March 16---20
days into the invasion and 13 days after Ukraine warned this exact
scenario might happen---**[a deepfake of Zelensky surrendering indeed
appeared, and it was ... unconvincing and obvious.]{.underline}**

The video editing was low-quality, and the voice was noticeably off; few
people seem to have been fooled by it. Not to take any chances, Zelensky
himself quickly addressed the deepfake, leaving no doubt about its
falsity.

**[One is tempted to conclude from this episode that deepfake algorithms
are just not powerful enough yet, that the dreaded moment when deepfakes
wreak havoc in political arenas is still off in the distant future, if
it ever arrives. However, a closer inspection of the past few years
reveals a different story: The destabilizing effects of deepfakes in
politics have already arrived---not in a single widely publicized
scandal or a flood of numerous incidents, but in an ominous trickle of
subtle yet impactful incidents that largely slipped under the
radar.]{.underline}** This **[Zelensky deepfake was quickly put to rest,
but there are other videos from past years whose authenticity is
unclear---even today we don't know whether they are deepfakes or
real.]{.underline}** The difficulty in debunking deepfakes isn't just a
question of technological sophistication.

Three years ago, **[Mother Jones reported a story surrounding Ali Bongo,
the president of Gabon. Bongo was hospitalized for an undisclosed
illness in October 2018. Two months later, the vice president announced
that Bongo had suffered a stroke but was recovering and doing
well]{.underline}**. **[However, other than a few photos and a silent
video released by the government, there were no signs of Bongo during
this time. Speculation proliferated that the officials were lying, that
Bongo was in far worse condition than they admitted---and possibly even
dead]{.underline}**. To **[help allay these concerns, on Jan. 1, 2019,
the government posted to social media a video of President Bongo giving
the customary New Year's address.]{.underline}**

**[But something didn't seem right]{.underline}**.

Bruno Ben Moubamba, **[a prominent Gabonese politician who ran against
Bongo in the previous two elections, claimed the video was a
deepfake]{.underline}**. He argued **[that Bongo's face seemed strangely
immobile and that his eye movements did not appear synchronized with his
jaw movements]{.underline}**. Julie Owono, the international technology
lawyer who brought this Bongo saga to the attention of **[Mother Jones,
noted that Bongo blinked only 13 times during the two-minute video,
which she said was less than half the typical amount. The deepfake
theory rapidly gained a sizable following]{.underline}**. Activists
argued that Gabon's ruling party used deepfake technology to hide
Bongo's dire state of health in order to avoid a special election
mandated by law to occur if the president is unfit to lead.

**[One week after the release of the enigmatic New Year's video, Gabon's
military attempted a coup and explicitly cited the oddness of the video
as evidence that the president was absent and that the government was
lying about it.]{.underline}** The coup failed and the government
retained control, and in August 2019 Bongo finally made his first public
appearance since the stroke.

**[We still don't know whether Bongo's party used a deepfake video to
deceive the public long enough for him to recover---and in doing so
illegally avoided a special election that might have led to his
ouster]{.underline}**. One of the complications is that all the oddities
in the New Year's video that suggest it's a deepfake could also be the
result of Bongo's stroke.

**[This event in Gabon foreshadows one that took place in the United
States a year late]{.underline}**r.

On Oct**[. 2, 2020, just weeks before one of the most important
elections in American history, news broke that President Trump had
tested positive for COVID-19. Questions mounted throughout the day over
the severity of his illnes]{.underline}**s. At 6:31 p.m., **[he tweeted
an 18-second video in which he said that he was heading to Walter
Reed,]{.underline}** but he reassured people that he thinks he is doing
very well.

Just as with Bongo's New Year's address, **[this video looks very
strange. Trump has an uncharacteristically flat affect, motionless
manner, and vacant look in his eyes. Immediately there was talk on
social media of it being a deepfake to hide the dire state of the
president's health.]{.underline}**

This time, suspicion quickly faded as more footage of Trump appeared.
The theory was fully dispelled when he gave a live address upon
departing Walter Reed a few days later. But **[for a brief moment, it
really was hard to know what was going on and what to
believe]{.underline}**. **[The existence of deepfake technology meant
that Trump's 18-second video raised more questions than it
answered]{.underline}**. In hindsight, the things that made the video
appear to be a possible deepfake were likely just a result of the
president being ill and possibly medicated.

Days later, **[Trump's team posted a video of him speaking from the
White House lawn, and once again skepticism arose. Some claimed that it
looked like the background was "glitchy," as though there were a green
screen behind him]{.underline}**. But Slate quickly debunked the doubts.

A few months later, **[another instance of deepfake dystopia occurred,
this time in Myanmar. On Feb. 1, 2021, a military coup officially began
when Prime Minister Aung San Suu Kyi---who in the 2010s played a key
role in transitioning Myanmar from military rule to partial
democracy---was arrested and deposed, along with other members of her
ruling party]{.underline}**. The president of the U.N. General Assembly
called for her immediate release; the U.N. secretary-general said **[the
coup is a "serious blow to democratic reforms in
Myanmar."]{.underline}** Suu Kyi is a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, **[and
while she has received international criticism for her country's role in
the genocide of the Rohingya people and her denial of the atrocities
that were committed, she is a legitimate democratically elected leader;
the military needed to justify the brazen steps it took.]{.underline}**

**[A military-run TV station broadcast a video recording of a detained
former regional chief minister providing a public confession in which he
said he bribed Suu Kyi]{.underline}**. **[This seemed to establish the
military's claims that Suu Kyi is corrupt and violated ethics
laws]{.underline}**. Some claimed **[the minister's voice in the video
doesn't sound like his usual one and noted that the visuals look
strange: his facial movements follow a repetitive pattern and his
expression looks oddly emotionless. To this day, some people suspect it
is a deepfake]{.underline}**, while others believe the unnaturalness
observed in the video is the result of it being a forced confession and
poor teleprompting. **[Once again, we don't know for
sure]{.underline}**. The video is somewhat low-resolution and grainy,
which makes distinguishing between a deepfake and an authentic video
particularly challenging. **[Suu Kyi is currently under military arrest
and facing an array of charges, including
corruption]{.underline}**---which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years
in prison.

What we see in these examples is that the context of a video plays an
enormous role in how difficult it is to determine its authenticity.
**[People speak in a somewhat unusual manner in deepfake videos---but,
as became apparent with both the Trump and Bongo incidents, people also
do so when infirm. The stress of duress, such as the Myanmar official
was experiencing, could also alter one's speech patterns]{.underline}**.
And the resolution of a video matters: the flaws in deepfakes are more
apparent in high-res footage. **[Finally, the political situation
matters. For instance, the Zelensky deepfake was a foolish endeavor not
just because it was too amateur to be convincing---it was easy to debunk
because Zelensky could respond to it.]{.underline}**

Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by this ill-conceived
Zelensky deepfake. **[More difficult deepfake situations have already
occurred in the past and more will surely arise in the
future]{.underline}**.

### Internal Link -- Bioweapon Proliferation

#### Bioweapon Impact - Russian disinformation undermines norms against biological weapons proliferation and increasingly normalizes their usage in conflict

**[Disinformation attacks bring with them many dangers. Beyond sowing
distrust and political dissent, they can prime a population for physical
conflict, and in the case of Georgia, Russia may even be trying to
justify future military interference with its neighbor]{.underline}**.
**[False claims about biological weapons in particular, though, create
an additional grave danger]{.underline}**: **[They erode the
international norm against using them, making countries more likely to
do so.]{.underline}** While it is easy to dismiss the Russian messaging
as nonsense, as the US Embassy in Georgia has done**[, it is important
to actively counter the effect it will likely have on the norm against
using biological weapons.]{.underline}**

An intensifying, multi-channel attack. **[Stories about supposed US
bioweapon labs in neighboring countries, and in particular about the
Lugar Center, have circulated for a number of years in the Russian
media]{.underline}**. Indeed, Russia's official national security
strategy identifies the network of public health laboratories in the
Caucasus and Central Asia funded by the US Defense Department as a
strategic threat. That said, messaging about the Lugar Center
significantly ramped up after Britain identified Russia as the
perpetrator of a botched March 2018 murder attempt in Salisbury, England
using the nerve agent novichok. (Russian agents tried to kill former
Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, without success, but
ended up inadvertently killing an English civilian**[.) In early April,
embattled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who Russia supports
militarily, attacked civilians in Douma with chlorine
gas.]{.underline}**

**[In April, within weeks of Britain pinpointing the Russian state as
culpable for the Salisbury attack, and a day after Trump threatened
Russia with US missile strikes on Syria in response to the Douma attack,
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova questioned the
"real goals" of the American "chain of microbiological laboratories" in
former Soviet states and of "the Pentagon's largescale
medical-biological activities near Russian borders."]{.underline}**
After British counter- 3 terrorism police presented findings from six
months of evidence-gathering on the Skripal case, and issued domestic
and European arrest warrants for two Russian suspects on September 4,
the accusations drastically intensified.

### Disinfo Undermines Public Health

#### Russia and China use disinformation to reduce US credibility on COVID

Criticizing the Democratic Response 

[**The first theme relates to articles and reports that criticise the
responses of governments in Europe and North America.** Some reporting
questioned how these countries handled the coronavirus pandemic. An
article published by China Plus highlights a survey of US citizens that
suggests that President Trump has not taken the situation seriously
enough]{.underline}\[12\], [and CGTN wrote that the coronavirus exposed
the lack of international leadership from the US.]{.underline}\[13\]
[Turkey\'s TRT World highlighted that minority rights were allegedly
under threat during the lockdown in France, labelling that country a
place where 'discrimination is rampant' and constitutes a 'societal
sickness\'.]{.underline}\[14\] 

[RT carried a piece claiming that the major pillars of European
liberalism-such as the right to free movement---were being torn
down.]{.underline}{15\] Some reports also claim that Western financial
speculators are taking advantage with a ruthless 'opportunism' by buying
up cheap stock, and that Westerners are selling medical supplies on the
black market for hugely inflated prices.(14\] [Further, some of the
outlets ask whether the crisis would be used by Westem leaders to
undermine constitutional democratic rights.]{.underline}\[16\] [Iranian
outlets such as Press TV have stated that US sanctions have greatly
exacerbated the pandemic in their country.]{.underline}{17\] Praising
their Own Global Leadership 

'The second narrative theme we have identified is the 'emphasis that
state-backed outlets have placed upon the success of their home country
in containing the virus. 

[Chinese state-backed outlets have been keen to 'emphasise China's
successful containment of the virus, and position China as an exemplar
to other nations]{.underline}. 'Such claims allowed them to build the
large amount of 'love' reactions referenced above. A People's Daily
article praised 'academicians from the Chinese 'Academy of Sciences and
Chinese Academy of Engineering \[who\] have become known as "warriors in
white". [They highlight China\'s resolution of the admissions crisis for
the nation's hospitals.]{.underline}\[18\] A China Daily article
pronounces that 'Wuhan provides hope for the rest of the world', while a
dedicated section of the China Daily website promotes 'Fighting COVID-19
the Chinese way', with links to "five potential treatments" that Chinese
researchers have identified as potential treatments for coronavirus. The
site also prominently features an article with the claim that "TCM
(traditional Chinese medicine) \[is\] effective in treating COVID-19
patients" \[19\] Outside of China, [TRT World has published articles
portraying Turkey positively, asserting that Turkey is better equipped
to handle the pandemic with a higher number of ICU beds per capita than
China, Europe and the US.]{.underline}\[20\] 

**[These state-backed agencies\_\_ present their governments as world
powers offing assistance to struggling democracies and other nations
suffering from the pandemic]{.underline}**---help is greatly appreciated
by those nations. China is especially engaged in a major effort to
improve its international reputation by providing assistance to other
countries during the pandemic, and these efforts have been widely
covered in their state outlets. A CGTN article titled "China announces
to help '82 countries fight COVID-19\" highlights the wide scope of
China\'s international aid.{21\] Similar [articles in Chinese state
outlets show the distribution of Chinese medical supplies such as masks
and respirators to highly affected regions such as Italy\[22\],
Spain(23\] and the UK.]{.underline}(24\] [In another instance, CGTN
promoted a video showing Italians playing the Chinese anthem to thank
China and singing "Grazie China]{.underline}\*\[25\], [**which a number
of independent researchers have claimed was manufactured.** Russian
outlets employed similar narratives.]{.underline} One 'Sputnik article
claimed that \"Russia may supply to Latin America, Africa mobile
hospitals to combat COVID-19\" Another notes Russia\'s efforts to
provide aid to Italy, with "seven Russian Ilyushin IL76 military
transport planes carrying medical supplies and experts to help Italy.\"
RT aired a report about an Italian businessman who replaced an EU flag
on his factory grounds with a Russian flag, "to thank Russia for sending
12 planes \[while\] the EU closes everything down.\"(26\] Turkish
Outlets also followed this line with, for example, Anadolu airing
articles expressing support for Italy and Gaza.\[27\] 

### Impact -- Public Health/Infodemic

**Disinformation can dramatically undermine public health -- COVID
proves**

**Jenson, Technical University of Denmark Office for Communication and
Media officer, , 22** 

\[Tore Jenson,. 2-18-22, American Association for the Advancement of
Science, "Social media echo chambers spread vaccine misinformation",
<https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/943999>, accessed on 7-8-2022,
MG\]

**[WHO has named vaccine hesitancy one of the greatest threats to global
health. Nonetheless, some people are hesitant or refuse to get
vaccinated because they do not trust vaccines and health authorities. A
new research result from DTU, published in the journal PLOS One, shows
that misinformation on social media contributes to this distrust and
creates a false image of benefits and disadvantages concerning
vaccines.]{.underline}**

**[\"Where vaccine supporters often refer to news media and science
sites when sharing knowledge about vaccines on Twitter, we can see that
profiles belonging to anti-vaccine profiles far more often share links
to]{.underline}** YouTube videos and to **[sites that are known to
spread fake news and conspiracy theories,]{.underline}** which previous
research has also shown,\" **[says]{.underline}** Bjarke **[Mønsted who
holds a PhD from DTU Compute.]{.underline}** He continues:

\" Furthermore, vaccine opponents profiles often link to commercial
sites that sell alternative health products. This is surprising given
that vaccine hesitancy often stems from a fear of financial conflicts of
interest. Particularly because previous research has shown that 12
people globally are responsible for vaccine misinformation, including
people who earn a fortune from the sale of alternative health
products.\"

**[Along with]{.underline}** Sune **[Lehmann from the Research Section
for Cognitive Systems at DTU Compute]{.underline}**, Bjarke **[Mønsted
has analyzed some 60 billion tweets written before the pandemic to
understand where the discussion about vaccines takes place on Twitter to
better understand today\'s vaccine hesitancy on social
media.]{.underline}**

[Anti- and pro-vaxxers do not talk to each other]{.underline}

Using newly developed methods in the area of artificial intelligence
called\' deep learning\' and \'natural language processing, the
researchers have taught a computer to identify which views on vaccines
were expressed in a given tweet.

[**In doing so, they identified the users who consistently expressed
strong views in favour of (provaxx) or against vaccines (antivaxx) and
from which sources the profiles shared their vaccine
information.**]{.underline} Their work shows that 22.5 per cent of
antivaxx-profiles\' vaccine tweets link to YouTube videos.

The researchers then grouped the sources into five categories: Sites
known for sharing pseudoscience and conspiracy theories, news sites,
social media, YouTube (which was given its own category due to a large
number of links), and finally, commercial sites relating to medicine and
health.

The research confirms the echo chamber effect, making it hard for
vaccine advocates and opponents to encounter each other\'s views on the
internet---because social media algorithms ensure that people interact
with others whose opinions align with their own.

\" In fact, we discovered that the sources of information, which people
are exposed to in their social networks, depend heavily on their own
attitudes towards vaccines. The more resistance to vaccines a user
expressed, the further from the norm was the media picture they were
exposed to from their circle of friends,\" says Bjarke Mønsted.

**[Combatting misinformation is a joint responsibility]{.underline}**

**[Suppose the health authorities want greater support for vaccines. In
that case, the responsibility lies not just with the tech giants but
also with media outlets when it comes to avoiding medical
misinformation, says]{.underline}** Bjarke **[Mønsted]{.underline}**.

**[\" Research clearly shows that combatting misinformation is a joint
responsibility. It is important that media outlets do not create a false
balance between views giving equal, or maybe even more, airtime to
anti-vaccine arguments that are not substantiated by the scientific
literature. Media should not portray medical information and
misinformation as equivalent views,\" says]{.underline}** Bjarke
**[Mønsted]{.underline}**.

Professor Sune Lehmann hopes that the novel method, which he and Bjarke
Mønsted have developed and used to analyze the many billions of tweets,
can provide a greater understanding of the vaccine discussion during the
pandemic and in the future:

\"Our research covers the period before COVID-19. And there is no doubt
that vaccines have become a talking point in a whole new way in the last
two years. It has gained a lot of attending and been overturned in a
completely new way in the last two years. Vaccines have gone from being
a topic that was primarily discussed among particular population groups
to becoming a markedly more mainstream topic. Therefore, the exciting
challenge going forward will be to use our methodological innovations to
understand whether---and how---this shift has changed the discussion and
the various actors\' motives.\"

#### Disinformation is deadly and can cause preventable deaths -- COVID infodemic proves

Infodemic: Social Media and the Power of COVID-19 Misinformation\",

**[The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a substantial impact
worldwide, with over 266 million diagnosed cases and over 5 million
deaths]{.underline}** \[1\]. **[In 2021, depending on the month,
COVID-19 was either the first, second, or third leading cause of death
in the United States]{.underline}**, alongside heart disease and cancer
\[2\]. [**People are still dying from COVID-19 despite a vaccine surplus
in wealthy countries, public health interventions to curb viral
transmission, new therapeutic options, and the heroic efforts of
frontline care providers. Why? Although we initially focused on a deadly
and contagious virus, we were simultaneously overwhelmed by the deadly
and contagious impact of online misinformation and disinformation about
that virus**]{.underline} \[3\]. **[Much like the COVID-19 pandemic
itself, we face a widespread disease with long-term consequences: the
COVID-19 infodemic.]{.underline}**

[**The World Health Organization defines an infodemic as "too much
information or false and misleading information" that "causes confusion,
risk taking behaviors\...and mistrust of health officials"**
\[4\].]{.underline} The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
Cultural Organization considers fake news a general term for false
information that can be further defined by intentionality \[5\].
Misinformation consists of "information that is false but not created
with the intention of causing harm," whereas disinformation is
"information that is false and deliberately created to harm a person,
social group, organisation, or country" often orchestrated with
financial or political motives \[5\]. Both are prevalent across all
social media platforms \[6\]. **[Together, these serve to undermine
trust in governmental interventions, public health responses, expert
guidance, and scientific facts about COVID-19]{.underline}** \[7,8\].
[Accordingly, **we define the COVID-19 infodemic as the overwhelming
amount of complex and often contradictory information available about
COVID-19, inclusive of substantial fake news about the origins of the
virus, treatment options unsupported by rigorous clinical data, and
baseless claims regarding adverse effects of lifesaving vaccines; these
false narratives may be spread by authoritative institutions or
influencers who are otherwise thought to be trustworthy, and they play a
substantial role in shaping views and influencing human behaviors that
can lead to poor health outcomes.**]{.underline}

[**The clinical impact of the COVID-19 infodemic is profound. Effective
strategies such as masking and social distancing have been undermined to
the detriment of those at greatest risk. With several effective vaccines
now available for SARS-CoV-2, vaccine hesitancy and vaccine
refusal---two distinct problems with different causes and different
solutions---have become major issues. Vaccine hesitancy is prolonged
deliberation or delay in accepting vaccination, even when supply is
ample; this differs from vaccine refusal, which is defined by the
specific intent not to vaccinate, similar to the "anti-vax" movement
adherents, in which people refuse all vaccines including childhood
vaccinations. Both vaccine hesitancy and refusal are fueled by
misinformation on social media,**]{.underline} and vaccine
misinformation that initially manifests offline can quickly spread to
social media platforms; the misinformation exchange is bidirectional
\[9\]. In fact, **[the US Surgeon General warned in 2021 that
misinformation is the greatest threat to COVID-19 vaccination
efforts]{.underline}** \[10\]. COVID-19 misinformation and
[**disinformation on social media increases vaccine hesitancy, lowers
vaccination rates, and causes preventable deaths, especially among
certain demographic populations**]{.underline} \[11,12**[\]. The
COVID-19 infodemic remains deadly, and we must act.]{.underline}**

To address this, the Stanford University Ethics, Society, and Technology
Hub and the Stanford Department of Emergency Medicine cosponsored
INFODEMIC: A Stanford Conference on Social Media and COVID-19
Misinformation. INFODEMIC convened experts from the fields of social
media, medicine, public health, and biomedical ethics with a goal of
identifying new best practices to combat COVID-19 misinformation online
\[13\]. The corresponding Journal of Medical Information Research theme
issue, "Social Media, Ethics, and COVID-19 Misinformation" builds upon
this work to discuss the impact of this infodemic and approaches to
ending it. In this editorial, we will examine the role of social media
companies (executives, financiers, leaders, and users) in health
misinformation and their obligations to mitigate the COVID-19 infodemic.

[They wrongly believing the products to be a cure for the
virus.]{.underline}

However, the actual figure may never been known, as data from Iran -
where many of the supposed methanol poisoning deaths occurred - is
difficult to verify.

[The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said that the
\"infodemic\" surrounding Covid-19 spread just as quickly as the virus
itself, with conspiracy theories, rumours and cultural stigma all
contributing to deaths and injuries.]{.underline}

[Many of the victims had followed advice resembling credible medical
information - such as eating large amounts of garlic or ingesting large
quantities of vitamins - as a way of preventing infection, the study\'s
authors say. Others drank substances such as cow urine.]{.underline}

[These actions all had \"potentially serious implications\" on their
health, the researchers say.]{.underline}

[The paper concludes that it is the responsibility of international
agencies, governments and social media platforms to fight back against
this \"infodemic\", but tech companies have been criticised for their
slow and patchy response. In the UK, laws to regulate online harm might
be several years away.]{.underline}

[The BBC\'s own investigations found links to assaults, arson and deaths
as a result of misinformation about the virus, and spoke to doctors,

campaigners will use the platform provided by social media to persuade

The tweet depicted above obviously never happened. But given the
ubiquity of social media today, **[it is interesting to consider what
might have occurred if the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 had taken place
in the global information environment of 2019]{.underline}**.^1^

[Nongovernmental open source intelligence organizations could have used
commercial satellite imagery to detect the presence of these missiles
and publicize them to the world]{.underline} on October 12, [four days
earlier than the president]{.underline} did. [Pictures of Soviet
missiles being deployed in Cuba might have found their way to social
media, then going viral and alarming millions in the United States and
around the world.]{.underline} Imagine that these images were
[accompanied by disinformation]{.underline} from internet trolls,
tailored information leaks, and propaganda from adversaries, all
[seeking to cast doubt on the facts or to sow confusion among domestic
populations and paralyze NATO leadership]{.underline}.

**[The shooting down of a U-2 spy plane over Cuba might have been news
within an hour of its occurrence, soon accompanied by numerous tweets
and relentless commentary on Facebook and other social media platforms,
with some posts including realistic (though fake) video clips of what
happened]{.underline}**. [When the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommendation
to invade Cuba was overruled by President Kennedy, "alt" social media
accounts that served as fronts for disgruntled Pentagon officials might
have leaked the proposed invasion plan, hoping to induce the
administration to reverse course on the chosen alternative, a
blockade.]{.underline}

In the end, [President Kennedy might not have had days to deliberate
with the Executive Committee of the National Security Council before
delivering a measured speech announcing to the world the discovery of
Soviet medium- and intermediate-range nuclear-armed missiles in
Cuba]{.underline},^2^ but instead might have issued the tweet depicted
above.

[If the Cuban Missile Crisis, which many experts have characterized as
the world's closest approach to nuclear war, occurred today, the current
global information ecosystem might very well have magnified the risk of
war, escalating a high-stakes crisis into all-out nuclear
exchange.^3^]{.underline}

**[The misuse of social media in the information environment has also
made rational responses to the threat of climate change more difficult
for national governments to reach]{.underline}**, **[as companies and
groups with financial and ideological interest in creating the
appearance of doubt sow misinformation about consensus scientific
view]{.underline}**. That is, **[cyber-enabled information warfare is a
threat multiplier in the climate change arena, just as it is in the
nuclear policy area.]{.underline}**

But **[corruption of the information ecosystem is not just a multiplier
of two long acknowledged existential threats to the future of
humanity]{.underline}**---**[climate change and nuclear weapons.
Cyber-enabled information warfare has also become an existential threat
in its own right, its increased use posing the realistic possibility of
a global information dystopia, in which the pillars of modern democratic
self-government---logic, truth, and reality---are shattered, and
anti-Enlightenment values undermine civilization around the
world.]{.underline}**

#### The impact is existential - Compromised information undermines Civilization, threatens Elections, Lives, and the Economy, and magnifies the likelihood of Nuclear War and Climate Change.

Founded in 1945, the Bulletin first focused on the existential threat
from nuclear war. The atomic scientists of the Manhattan Project did not
believe that the miniature suns let loose on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
themselves posed an existential threat to human existence.^4^ But most
of them recognized that they were omens of a future in which [nuclear
weapons, used on a large scale, could]{.underline} indeed [threaten
human existence, and]{.underline} even [used on a smaller scale could
threaten modern human civilization.]{.underline}

After sporadically reporting on climate change for decades, in 2007 the
Bulletin formally expanded its concept of existential threat to include
that and nuclear war.^5^ [Where large-scale nuclear war threatens to
snuff out hundreds of millions of lives in a matter of hours, climate
change threatens to alter the planetary ecosystem]{.underline}. Here
[the effects are more subtle and less easily noticed because they are
cumulative over decades. There is no single cataclysmic event in the
offing, and yet myriad smaller regional disasters will result: more
intense and more frequent forest fires, heat waves, and storms; vastly
increased coastal flooding and rising sea levels; loss of arable land;
severe shortages of food and water; and mass migrations and
relocations.]{.underline}

[Nuclear war and climate change threaten the physical infrastructure of
human civilization as well as the underlying geochemical processes and
the ecology of the planet]{.underline}. [Because most people depend on
both physical infrastructure and our global ecology for food, energy,
and other necessities of existence, nuclear war and climate change put
the lives of the great mass of humanity at risk]{.underline}. [Because
nuclear war and climate change threaten massive changes in cultural
identity and the loss of historical resources, our civilization and our
legacy are at stake, too]{.underline}. In those ways, both nuclear war
and climate change pose existential threats to humanity. But these are
not the only such threats to civilization as we know it.

[The infrastructure for human civilization is]{.underline} undeniably
tangible (that is, physical, chemical, and biological), but it is
**[increasingly virtual]{.underline}** as well, and the virtual aspects
of that infrastructure---**[the information ecosystem]{.underline}** (or
environment)---in many ways **[has become central and often critical to
the way people now live all over the world.]{.underline}**

In the words of Yale Law School's information scholar Jack Balkin, "it
is not an exaggeration to say that **[modern states are informational
states: states that recognize and solve problems of governance by
collecting, analyzing, and distributing information.]{.underline}**"^6^
Consider that **[nations require good information to allocate benefits
and social services to the populace; to administer mechanisms for public
safety]{.underline}** (e.g., law enforcement, court systems,
fire-fighting); **[to provide for national security; to gather revenue
to support national expenditures; and to engage with other nations in
ways that support national interests.]{.underline}**

Businesses and nonprofit entities in turn are also highly dependent on
information. They use it to develop products and services for customers
and clients; to understand markets and audiences for their products and
services; to inform customers and clients about their products and
services; to comply with laws and regulations applicable to their
products and services; and to maintain their accounting and finances.
Construction and manufacturing projects entail the coordination of
dozens, hundreds, or thousands of parties---all of whom must have a
justifiable confidence in the information they are sharing and relying
upon.

**[Contextualized, reliable, trustworthy information is as important to
the thinking of human beings as clean air is to human breathing. Human
beings depend on good information for making informed decisions about
political candidates standing in elections; to know as consumers which
specific products and services will best serve their needs; for managing
their finances; in making health-related decisions]{.underline}** about
themselves and their loved ones; **[in learning to perform their
jobs]{.underline}** more effectively or efficiently; **[and
in]{.underline}** truly **[countless other ways.]{.underline}**

**[Nations also engage extensively in information
production.]{.underline}** They provide **[education for young people;
support scientific research that undergirds economic growth and
prosperity; and collect, curate, and disseminate large-scale statistical
data that influence decisions at every level of society]{.underline}**.

Imagine what life would be like **[if citizens could not count on the
validity and trustworthiness of the information underlying any of these
activities]{.underline}**. In some cases, the result would be no more
than minor annoyance. In others, however, **[the result could be
life-threatening.]{.underline}** **[Nations could be crippled, as
they]{.underline}** could and **[likely would make bad]{.underline}** or
at least suboptimal **[decisions about war and peace, the economy, law
enforcement, housing, food production, energy, and the many other
important matters for which governments have some
responsibility.]{.underline}**

[In the new information environment, exploitation of human cognitive
architecture and capabilities]{.underline}---which are largely unchanged
from what existed millennia ago---[provides the 21st century information
warrior with cyber-enabled capabilities that Hitler, Stalin, Goebbels,
and McCarthy could have only imagined. By exploiting cognitive
limitations, the perpetrators of cyber-enabled information warfare have
learned to exacerbate prejudices, biases, and ideological differences;
to add heat but no light to political discourse; and to spread widely
believed "alternative facts" in advancing their political
positions.]{.underline}

Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election has dominated
news headlines ever since. But [interference by authoritarian countries
in the elections of democratic states---as undesirable and threatening
as it may be---is hardly the only negative consequence of cyberenabled
information warfare]{.underline}. [The problems of nuclear war and
climate change are hard enough to solve even when well-intentioned,
well-informed parties on all sides share a basic understanding and
knowledge of the relevant facts.]{.underline} Yes, they may have
different values and different priorities, may act under different
constraints, and be able to bring to bear different levels of resources
to these problems.

But [without shared, fact-based understandings of the blast, thermal,
and radiation effects of nuclear explosions, what hope is there for
national leaders to reach agreements to reduce the threat of **nuclear
holocaust or to make** good decisions about nuclear weapons use in times
of crisis]{.underline}? **[Without]{.underline}** shared, fact-based
**[understandings that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
caused by human beings result in corresponding increases in global
temperature and climatic disruption, what hope is there for national
leaders to reach agreements to begin serious efforts at decarbonizing

### Impact -- Civilization

#### Unreliable information and information overload causes both legitimate and illegitimate actors to pressure leaders into rash escalatory responses.

On the risks of nuclear conflict, [theories and approaches to nuclear
deterrence and strategic stability]{.underline} developed prior to the
collapse of the Soviet Union in the late 1980's and early 1990's [rest
on the presumption of rationality in national decision
makers.]{.underline} In particular, [they assume that adversaries are
deterred from attacking by a threat of retaliation that would impose
costs on the adversary that would outweigh any conceivable benefits that
it would gain from an attack.]{.underline}^26^ [Central to this
assumption is a rational adversary that can and does make a calculation
of expected costs and benefits, compares them, and then acts
accordingly.]{.underline}

But the psychologically informed understanding of real-world decision
making described above was not accepted widely in the scientific
literature until approximately the same time as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and the seminal work in such understanding occurred only
in the decade previous to that. What a psychologically-informed
understanding of real-world decision making tells us is that [the
rationality assumption at the base of much traditional thinking on
deterrence and strategic stability is untenable, given that humans have
evolved to rely on intuitive, reflexive, heuristic]{.underline} System 1
[thinking to make decisions, particularly when faced with time
pressures, surprise and other obstacles to the deliberate
calculation]{.underline} implied by System 2 thinking.^27^ Psychology
tells us that -- more often than not -- the fast, intuitive judgements
of System 1 often take precedence over the slower, more analytical
thinking of System 2.

The challenges posed by instinctive reliance on System 1 thinking are
greatly accentuated by characteristics of today's information
environment. Social media networks in particular are optimally designed
to stimulate System 1 thinking---emotional, reflexive, immediate---and
they rapidly transmit content among like-minded individuals, creating
the ideal conditions for public polarization and divisiveness to
occur.^28^ Multiple narratives rapidly emerge around complex events;
**[citizens splinter into their own informational universes and are
unable to agree on an underlying reality. Political leaders themselves
are subject to these conflicting narratives and may even be active and
influential participants in one or another of them.]{.underline}**

It is thus easy to posit **[that in this information environment,
manipulated information--- either artificially constructed or adopted by
a strong grassroots base---could be used by interested parties to
generate pressure on leaders to act. At the same time, leaders
themselves are likely to be facing information overload and less able to
distinguish analyzed information from their own intelligence sources and
other, unvetted information originating from their
constituencies.]{.underline}**

[Nuclear war and climate change are arguably the most important
existential challenges today]{.underline} that are compounded by the
corruption of the information ecosystem. [But]{.underline} even if a
single miraculous stroke the laws of physics were changed to make
nuclear weapons impossible to build and operate and to immediately
eliminate anthropogenic emissions at zero cost, [cyberenabled
information warfare can still can lead to an information dystopia. Here
are some possible elements:]{.underline}

• [Adversaries manufacture numerous graphic videos of American
soldiers]{.underline} (complete with sound effects) [committing
battlefield atrocities]{.underline}, and spread them widely through the
Internet. Once upon a time, high-quality video forgeries were difficult
and expensive to make. AI-based technologies will bring this so-called
deepfake capability to the masses, and anyone with imagination, a
modicum of technical skill, and a personal computer will be able to
distribute reasonably realistic forgeries. Denials will be issued but of
course will also not be believed by large fractions of viewers. Even if
proof of inauthenticity can be provided, such evidence will not affect
the responses of many viewers.

• [Political campaigns conduct similar efforts to discredit political
opponents]{.underline} (e.g., "showing" an opponent making controversial
or disqualifying remarks before an election). But they also use the
existence of deepfake technologies to deflect attention from authentic
and real evidence of their own political and personal misdeeds. For
example, a real video of a candidate punching an old lady who supports
his opponent will be dismissed as "one of those deepfakes that anyone
could have produced."

• [Financial markets are disrupted by falsified videos of CEOs making
announcements regarding company prospects that are much more pessimistic
than expected]{.underline}. Attempts to correct the record are drowned
out in a subsequent flood of contradictory information, all of which
appear at first glance to be authentic.

• [Public safety is compromised by reports of local
disasters]{.underline} (e.g., explosions of chemical plants that result
in the release large amounts of toxic gases). These reports, along with
"authentic" video of people choking amidst locally familiar locations
(e.g., well-known fields or sport stadiums), cause spontaneous mass
evacuations. Contradictory directions for evacuation broadcast using
social media result in chaos on the streets and highways.

• [Public health is placed at risk when the safety and efficacy of
medical treatments known to be safe and effective are publicly
questioned through active disinformation campaigns]{.underline}
conducted on the Internet and in bookstores. Attempts to provide valid
information are met with responses such as "that's what the
pharmaceutical companies and medical establishment want you to think,
but just look at what's happened to our children."

• [Children in schools are threatened by online campaigns to spread
rumor, innuendo, and positive or negative information about various
students]{.underline}. Conducting such campaigns for pay becomes the
business model of entrepreneurs who advertise that they can guarantee
admission to selective colleges, boost the social standing of the
children of their clients, or take revenge on those who have harmed such
children, all in anonymous and untraceable ways.

• [Journalists, political leaders, and judges are compromised by
artfully forged emails and alterations]{.underline} to other documents
that are mixed with entirely authentic leaked emails and documents and
are indistinguishable from them.

[A world with these elements---and many more comparable ones---will be
the inevitable result if and when deployment and use of the tools of
cyber-enabled information warfare become widespread]{.underline}. And
even more troubling is the fact that [not every bit of information needs
to be corrupted for this dystopian outcome to occur]{.underline}---[it
will require only a fraction of it to be corrupted for people to lose
faith entirely in "objective" and "trustworthy" sources of information,
the result of which will be that people will fractionate into their own
information realities.]{.underline}

[The Enlightenment established reason and reality as the foundational
pillars of civilized discourse.]{.underline} In such discourse, logic
matters, and a logical contradiction between statement A and statement B
means that at least one of those statements is false. The truth of a
statement about the world is tested by its correspondence to objective
reality rather than by how many people believe it; that is, empirical
data are influential. Furthermore, statements known to be wrong or false
do not affect conclusions or choices between alternative courses of
action.

[Cyber-enabled information warfare provides the tactics, tools, and
procedures---in short, the means---to **replace the pillars of logic,
truth, and reality with fantasy, rage, and fear**.]{.underline} **[In a
world of ubiquitous cyber-enabled information warfare, communication and
information inflame passions rather than informing reason, play to the
worst in people's cognitive architectures rather than the best, and
divide rather than unify]{.underline}**. **[Deliberate corruption of the
information ecosystem could be seen as an analog of poisoning water
supplies that can be done remotely, inexpensively, and
anonymously.]{.underline}** All of this is just another way of saying
that today it is possible to see glimmerings of an anti-Enlightenment
that can possibly take root and that would indeed be the end of
civilization as we know it.

Adversaries foreign and domestic that make use [cyber-enabled
information warfare turn our internal cognitive processes and our
external institutional and legal processes against us]{.underline}.
Under the cover of "fair play" rubrics and the First Amendment, they
have turned us against ourselves. Desperately needed are ways of
countering the insidious tactics of cyber-enabled information warfare
for ourselves.

How might we proceed? [We need action to develop better ways of
identifying adversary cyber-enabled information warfare campaigns in
progress; good countermeasures to help human beings resist the use of
cyber-enabled information warfare operations targeted against them; and
good measures to degrade, disrupt, or expose the adversary's use of
cyberenabled information warfare operations]{.underline}. All of this is
easier said than done, however, as cyberenabled capabilities for
information warfare increase while human cognitive limitations remain
the same. Our work is cut out for us. **[If we fail, the world is at
increasing risk of large-scale and long-term societal fracture, the end
of the Enlightenment, and the start of an informational Dark
Age.]{.underline}**

### Nuclear War Impacts

#### Must act to prevent nuclear war -- impacts would be globally catastrophic

**Sparks, New York Post, 7-8-22**

\[Hannah, 7-8-22, New York Post, "Nuclear war would create 'dire'
worldwide hellscape: scientists",
<https://nypost.com/2022/07/08/nuclear-war-would-create-dire-worldwide-hellscape-scientists/>,
accessed 7-9-22, AFB\]

**[The threat of nuclear war goes well beyond the
warfront.]{.underline}**

**[Even far away from the terror seen by citizens and soldiers on the
frontlines, Russia's ongoing advancement into Ukraine has unsettled
global economies as well as a sense of freedom and security
abroad.]{.underline}**

**[As it should, say scientists, who warn of the grave danger that the
aftermath of nuclear war poses for the planet.]{.underline}**

Just nine nations of the world are in control of more than 13,000
nuclear weapons, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute. With that in mind, **[earth sciences and computational
researchers aimed to better understand --- so we can better prepare for
--- the dystopian landscape that could result from nuclear
war.]{.underline}**

**[Various computer simulations of nuclear firestorms saw a future with
scarce sunlight, food and resources --- globally.]{.underline}**

**[As soot and smoke from the blasts fill the upper atmosphere,
temperatures would plunge 13 degrees Fahrenheit in the first month ---
bigger than the drop that occurred during the last ice
age.]{.underline}**

**[With clouds blocking the Sun, crops would fail,]{.underline}** while
**[algae --- the basis of the marine food chain --- would disappear,
thus halting major fisheries]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, **[expanding ice
coverage]{.underline}** due to the cold shock --- growing by more than 6
million square miles and 6 feet deep --- **[would block major ports from
receiving shipments of food and other goods across seas]{.underline}**,
from Shanghai to Copenhagen.

**["It doesn't matter who is bombing whom. It can be India and Pakistan
or NATO and Russia. Once the smoke is released into the upper
atmosphere, it spreads globally and affects everyone,"
said]{.underline}** Cheryl **[Harrison, an assistant professor at
Louisiana State University, in a statement on behalf of a team of
international researchers]{.underline}**. Their work was published on
Thursday in the journal Earth and space sciences journal AGU Advances, a
Wiley publication.

Their simulations examined outcomes following drops of 4,400 100-kiloton
nuclear weapons between the US and Russia, which would release more than
330 billion pounds of smoke and sunlight-absorbing black carbon into the
upper atmosphere --- or if 500 bombs weighing 100 kilotons each were
detonated between India and Pakistan, which would see somewhere between
11 billion to 103 billion pounds of ash and smog ejected. (For
comparison, the bombs that hit Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945 were 21
and 15 kilotons, respectively.)

**[It's critical for world leaders to consider their findings, said
study co-author Alan]{.underline}** **[Robock, a professor in the
Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers
University.]{.underline}**

**["Nuclear warfare results in dire consequences for
everyone.]{.underline}** World leaders have used our studies previously
as an impetus to end the nuclear arms race in the 1980s, and five years
ago to pass a treaty in the United Nations to ban nuclear weapons,"
Robock said. "We hope that this new study will encourage more nations to
ratify the ban treaty."

Current global affairs should be a wake-up call, added Harrison.

**["The current war in Ukraine with Russia and how it has affected gas
prices, really shows us how fragile our global economy and our supply
chains are to what may seem like regional conflicts and perturbations,"
she said.]{.underline}**

Their models are not unlike what happens during massive volcanic
eruptions, researchers noted.

**["We can avoid nuclear war]{.underline}**, but volcanic eruptions are
definitely going to happen again. There's nothing we can do about it, so
it's important when we're talking about resilience and how to design our
society that we consider what we need to do to prepare for unavoidable
climate shocks," **[Harrison said. "We can and must, however, do
everything we can to avoid nuclear war. The effects are too likely to be
globally catastrophic."]{.underline}**

**[There are more than 13,000 nuclear weapons in the world controlled by
nine nations]{.underline}** (SPIRI, 2020). **[States with nuclear
weapons, including the United States, Russia, China, India, and
Pakistan, have recently embarked on plans to modernize or expand their
nuclear arsenals, while North Korea has developed, and Iran is at risk
of devel-oping new nuclear weapons capabilities]{.underline}** (SPIRI,
2020). **[The presence of these weapons creates a risk that they will be
launched intentionally or by mistake, by unstable leaders, hackers, or
computer failure]{.underline}** (Ellsberg, 2017; Perry & Collina, 2020).
**[In addition to the devastating loss of human life]{.underline}**
(Robock et al., 2019; Toon et al., 2019), **[it is important to quantify
the expected collateral damage to the Earth system and all its
inhabitants of such a nuclear crisis.]{.underline}** Here, we examine
the hysteresis response of the ocean to global cooling events driven by
the deto-nation of nuclear warheads.

Hysteresis is the property of a system that has a response that "lags
behind" the forcing variable, meaning that the system depends on the
history of the forcing (e.g., Visintin, 2013), either resulting in a new
state when forcing is removed (irreversible or rate-independent
hysteresis), or slowly returns to the initial state (dynamic or
rate-dependent hysteresis). In Earth system science, hysteresis has been
discussed in reference to the global ocean overturning circulation
(Kageyama et al., 2010; Rahmstorf, 1995) and the Antarctic ice sheet
(Garbe et al., 2020; Pollard & DeConto, 2005), which both have multiple
steady states depending on the forcing history. Other stud-ies have
defined rate-dependent hysteresis as not returning to the unperturbed
state within a time frame relevant for humans or other organisms
(Jeltsch-Thömmes et al., 2020), as in the asymmetry of the climate
response to increasing then decreasing CO2, a temporal lag largely
caused by the slow adjustment timescales of the ocean physical and
biogeochemical state (Hofmann et al., 2019; Jeltsch-Thömmes et al.,
2020; Steffen et al., 2018; Yang & Zhu, 2011). Both irreversible and
dynamic hysteresis occur in terrestrial (Drüke et al., 2021) and marine
ecosystems under climate disturbances, where they are often termed
regime shifts, sometimes due to "tipping points" in the system response
to forcing (Brierley & Kingsford, 2009; Cooper et al., 2020; Cowan et
al., 2008; deYoung et al., 2008; Drüke et al., 2021). Here, we
investigate the hysteresis of the ocean physical, biogeochem-ical, and
lower trophic level ecosystem response to nuclear cooling events.

**[In the Earth\'s past, abrupt global cooling driven by volcanic
eruptions has triggered atmospheric perturbations that persist for
several decades to hundreds of years or longer]{.underline}**
(Otto-Bliesner et al., 2015; Sigl et al., 2015), **[with recorded
impacts on human civilization including massive famine and fall of
empires]{.underline}** (Oppenheimer, 2011; White, 2011). **[Despite the
ocean\'s large role in climate]{.underline}** (Rahmstorf, 2002;
Sarmiento & Gruber, 2006) **[and food security]{.underline}** (FAO,
2018; Kent, 1997), **[the global ocean impacts of these cooling events,
and in particular the ocean biogeochemical and ecosystem response,
remain poorly understood.]{.underline}** Like volcanic eruptions
(Robock, 2000) and large forest fires (Khaykin et al., 2020; Peterson et
al., 2021; Yu et al., 2019, 2021), **[urban firestorms generated during
nuclear war using modern arsenals are expected to loft particles into
the upper troposphere and lower strat-osphere. However, the smoke would
have at least a three times longer residence time than volcanic
aerosols, lead-ing to more extended radiation anomalies]{.underline}**
(Coupe et al., 2019; Mills et al., 2008, 2014; Otto-Bliesner et al.,
2015; Robock et al., 2007; Sigl et al., 2015; Toon et al., 2019). This
long atmospheric residence time of soot is due to its ability to
self-loft to high altitude due to solar heating, as observed in recent
forest fires (Khaykin et al., 2020; Peterson et al., 2021; Yu et al.,
2019).

**[In recent work]{.underline}** (Toon et al., 2019), **[we simulated a
series of nuclear conflicts between India and Pakistan of vary-ing sizes
and impacts on global climate and compared them to a larger war between
the US and Russia]{.underline}** (Coupe et al., 2019; Robock et al.,
2007). **[As with volcanic-driven events, the reduction of sunlight
after nuclear war would lead to global cooling, in turn driving a wide
range of global changes, altering the living conditions on
Earth]{.underline}**. **[Examples include decreased agricultural and
fisheries productivity, with large implications for global food
security]{.underline}** (Jägermeyr et al., 2020; Scherrer et al., 2020;
Toon et al., 2019; Xia et al., 2015); increased surface ocean pH and
decreased aragonite saturation (Lovenduski et al., 2020); a 7 year El
Niño like event (Coupe et al., 2021); reduced ozone and increased UV
radiation at the surface (Bardeen et al., 2021; Mills et al., 2008) and
temporary expansion of sea ice (Mills et al., 2014). **[In simulations,
global ocean surface cooling penetrated to depth over decades,
indicating the potential for long-term impacts from relatively small
global cooling events on the physical ocean state]{.underline}** (Mills
et al., 2014). Further, in the largest war scenario between the US and
Russia, we found that after an initial decline in marine net primary
production (NPP), NPP eventually became significantly elevated above
pre-war levels long after the solar radi returned to normal. **[These
findings suggest that the extreme cooling caused by a nuclear war might
have the ability to trigger changes in the ocean system that persist
well beyond the initial perturbation.]{.underline}**

Abstract **[Nuclear war would produce dire global consequences for
humans and our environment. We simulated climate impacts of US-Russia
and India-Pakistan nuclear wars in an Earth System Model]{.underline}**,
here, we report on the ocean impacts. Like volcanic eruptions and large
forest fires, **[firestorms from nuclear war would transport
light-blocking aerosols to the stratosphere, resulting in global
cooling. The ocean responds over two timescales: a rapid cooling event
and a long recovery, indicating a hysteresis response of the ocean to
global cooling]{.underline}**. Surface cooling drives sea ice expansion,
enhanced meridional overturning, and intensified ocean vertical mixing
that is expanded, deeper, and longer lasting. Phytoplankton production
and community structure are highly modified by perturbations to light,
temperature, and nutrients, resulting in initial decimation of
production, especially at high latitudes. A new physical and
biogeochemical ocean state results, characterized by shallower
pycnoclines, thermoclines, and nutriclines, ventilated deep water
masses, and thicker Arctic sea ice. Persistent changes in nutrient
limitation drive a shift in phytoplankton community structure, resulting
in increased diatom populations, which in turn increase iron scavenging
and iron limitation, especially at high latitudes. In the largest
US-Russia scenario (150 Tg), ocean recovery is likely on the order of
decades at the surface and hundreds of years at depth, while changes to
Arctic sea-ice will likely last thousands of years, effectively a
"Nuclear Little Ice Age." **[Marine ecosystems would be highly disrupted
by both the initial perturbation and in the new ocean state, resulting
in long-term, global impacts to ecosystem services such as
fisheries.]{.underline}**

Plain Language Summary **[If nuclear arsenals were used accidentally or
intentionally, they would produce dire consequences for all life on
Earth. We simulated climate impacts of nuclear wars in a global Earth
system model, focusing on marine impacts. We simulated a US-Russia war
and several India-Pakistan wars]{.underline}**. **[In all scenarios,
firestorms from nuclear war would deliver soot to the upper atmosphere,
blocking out the sun]{.underline}** and causing global cooling.
**[Impacts of the nuclear cooling event include expansion of sea ice
into populated coastal areas and decimation of ocean marine
life.]{.underline}** **[In all scenarios, the ocean cools rapidly but
does not return to the pre-war state when the smoke
clears.]{.underline}** **[Instead, the ocean takes many decades to
return to normal, and some parts of the ocean would likely stay in the
new state for hundreds of years or longer.]{.underline}** When the
cooling event ends, Arctic sea ice is left in a new state, a sort of
"Nuclear Little Ice Age." **[Marine ecosystems would be highly disrupted
by both the initial perturbation and the resulting new ocean state,
resulting in impacts to ecosystem services worldwide, lasting for
decades. This study underscores the danger of nuclear war and the
long-term impacts to humans and our environment.]{.underline}**

#### Deep fakes have a lot of potential, several mayors were tricked in a call with a deepfake Kyiv mayor 

**Associated Press, 22**

**[The mayor of]{.underline}** the Ukrainian capital of **[Kyiv
warned]{.underline}** Saturday **[that an imposter is posing as him and
communicating with other officials, including three European mayors who
were duped into believing they were having a video call with the real
Vitali Klitschko.]{.underline}**

"**[Several mayors in Europe have been contacted by a fake mayor of Kyiv
who has been saying absurd things,]{.underline}**" Klitschko told German
daily newspaper Bild. "**[This is criminal energy. It must be urgently
investigated who is behind it.]{.underline}**"

**[The office of Berlin]{.underline}** Mayor Franziska Giffey tweeted
Friday night that she **[cut short a call with the reputed Kyiv mayor
after his comments and questions made her suspicious]{.underline}**.
"The course of the conversation and the setting of topics" made Giffey
wary, her office said without elaborating.

The office published a photo that showed both **[the German capital's
mayor and the fake Klitschko on a big screen]{.underline}**. It said
that initially, "**[there was no evidence that the video conference was
not conducted with a real person. To all appearances, it is deep
fake]{.underline}**."

Police were investigating the incident, Giffey's office said.

**[Madrid Mayor]{.underline}** José Luis Martínez-Almeida **[also
interrupted a video call with someone claiming to be Klitschko on
Friday. The mayor of Spain's capital suspected he wasn't speaking with
his Kyiv counterpart and has filed a complaint with
police.]{.underline}**

**[Vienna Mayor]{.underline}** Michael Ludwig **[did not end his call
with the imposter earlier this week because he didn't notice any
suspicious behavior]{.underline}**, Austrian public broadcaster ORF
reported.

"**[Since no tricky topics were discussed in the conversation, this is
certainly annoying in the specific occasion]{.underline}** but not a big
problem," Ludwig said.

It was not clear who was behind the calls or what means were used to try
to make the mayors think they were communicating with Klitschko.

On Saturday, Berlin's mayor said her encounter with the fraudster means
that "in the future, we will have to be even more scrutinizing, even
more suspicious."

She called **[the use of a phony Klitschko "a means of modern warfare,"
referring to Russia's four-month war on Ukraine.]{.underline}**

**[Kyiv's actual mayor also made a link to Russia's war in
Ukraine]{.underline}**.

"Friends! The enemy does not let up and is waging war on all fronts - in
particular by disinformation, by discrediting Ukrainian politicians,"
**[Klitschko said in a post on the Telegram messaging
app.]{.underline}** "In order to quarrel with European partners, so that
Ukraine would not be helped."

In his remarks to Bild, **[he warned other European officials to be
careful if they are contacted by someone claiming to represent his
office]{.underline}**. "Please be careful in the future how appointments
are arranged by me. Official conversations only come through official
channels," he said.

### AT -- No One Fooled by Russian Disinfo

#### Disinformation has lasting impact -- Russia HIV propaganda proves

**Poster, State Department historian, 18**

**[Imagine a covert plan to weaken the United States, not through
military sabotage or stealing state secrets, but simply through the
manipulation of the news media. The plan involves foreign agents who
write and disseminate false news articles with the aim of destabilizing
American society and driving a wedge between the United States and its
allies.]{.underline}**

No, this isn't a story about the 2016 election, but rather about **[how
the Soviet Union capitalized on perceived American indifference toward
the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and began disseminating "fake news" as
part of a disinformation campaign that had major ramifications for
American foreign policy --- and may well still be influencing
Russian-American relations .]{.underline}**

To be fair, the Reagan administration was slow to act when it came to
HIV/AIDS. In a news conference on Oct. 15, 1982, journalist Lester
Kinsolving [asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAzDn7tE1lU) White
House press secretary Larry Speakes whether President Ronald Reagan had
any reaction given that "AIDS is now an epidemic." Speakes provided a
terrifyingly ignorant response: "What's AIDS?"

When Kinsolving tried to explain the nature of the illness, noting that
it was informally known as the "gay plague," Speakes responded in jest,
saying, "I don't have it. Do you?" The fact that the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention had been reporting on AIDS for more than a year
apparently was not known in the White House. "There has been no personal
experience here," Speakes concluded.

**[The spread of AIDS within the United States and the negligence of the
Reagan administration provided the Soviets with an opportunity at a
moment when Cold War tensions were high. Noting that many Americans were
distrustful of their government after the Vietnam War, and observing
that HIV/AIDS was more prevalent in groups that were critical of
Reagan's policies, the Soviets decided that beginning a disinformation
campaign about the origins of the disease could sow dissent within the
nation and among U.S. allies.]{.underline}**

Historian Thomas Boghardt said **[the campaign started on July 17, 1983,
when a newspaper]{.underline}** in India, the Patriot, **[published an
anonymous letter from an "American scientist." The scientist claimed
that AIDS was an American biological weapon created at Fort
Detrick]{.underline}**, Md. A former Soviet bloc intelligence officer
who corresponded with Boghardt noted that **[the disinformation campaign
"virtually conceptualized itself" because of the controversy about AIDS
within the United States.]{.underline}**

The Patriot had a circulation of only 35,000, so **[the placement of the
anonymous letter did not create the panic that Soviet agents had hoped
for, but persistence paid off. Throughout the next three years,
embassies across the world reported on newspaper articles that accused
the United States of creating AIDS as a biological weapon. In November
1985, embassy officials in
Nicaragua [noted](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1981-88v41/d9) that
pro-Sandinista publications were participating in the disinformation
campaign and had run stories that Americans had tested AIDS on Haitians
as well as "certain groups in North America."]{.underline}**

As HIV/AIDS spread rapidly in Africa, **[U.S. embassies complained to
the State Department that the Soviets had blanketed the continent with
disinformation. By 1986, newspapers in Nairobi; Lagos, Nigeria and
Dakar, Senegal, had run stories that claimed that Americans had created
the AIDS virus, that blood supplies from the United States were
contaminated
and [that](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1981-88v41/d19) "the
citation of Africa as the disease's point of origin is some sort of
Western conspiracy."]{.underline}**

Because up to one-third of urban-dwelling adults in Central and East
Africa were infected by 1987, these articles generated reasonable
consternation among African leaders. The State Department sent a
telegram to all African diplomatic posts in August 1986 with talking
points that rebutted these allegations and emphasized that blood
originating from the United States was not infected.

The department sent a similar telegram to all of its diplomatic posts
worldwide in December 1986 as disinformation continued to spread. The
telegram asked posts
to [suggest](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1981-88v41/d21) means
of "developing a counter strategy" as disinformation had become global
and pernicious, and American officials seemed powerless to stop it.

**[By 1987, the narrative that Americans were carriers, if not creators,
of a dangerous disease had taken hold to such an extent that officials
in the Philippines expressed concern about U.S. servicemen at military
bases in their nation]{.underline}**. Central to their distress was the
notion that Americans were spreading HIV/AIDS in the Philippines and
that the epidemic
"[was](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1981-88v41/d32) not
merely a public health problem" but a social problem, with Americans
identified as agents of contagion. This conception posed political
problems: **[The Filipino government proceeded to demand more funding
for an anti-AIDS campaign from the United States as a
result.]{.underline}**

Despite the success of their disinformation campaign, the Soviet leaders
began to change course in 1987, the same year they first acknowledged
publicly that AIDS had spread to their nation. In a July 1987 meeting
with Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Chet Crocker,
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamishin admitted privately that
**[the Soviets had "only begun to understand the magnitude of the AIDS
problem"
and [stated](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1981-88v41/d30) that
he had "no difficulty" in admitting elements of the Soviet
disinformation campaign were "foolish."]{.underline}**

In a meeting at the Soviet Embassy**[, State Department officials
remarked that they welcomed newfound Soviet efforts to combat AIDS, but
urged the Soviets to cease their "[blatantly false allegations
first](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1981-88v41/d23)."]{.underline}**

**[As a result of the changing Soviet posture, American policymakers
were finally able to limit the damage of the Soviet disinformation
campaign --- but only because the Soviets sought to trade the campaign
for scientific collaboration --- a testament to how effective "fake
news" can be.]{.underline}**

In the years that followed, presidential administrations proved more
responsive to the AIDS epidemic. President George W. Bush's PEPFAR
initiative targeted AIDS in Africa and has since provided antiretroviral
treatment to 7.7 million people and saved about 11 million lives.

**[Despite the American commitment to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic,
conspiracy theories remain. A quick search on the Internet will reveal
numerous websites that assert that AIDS was, in fact, a biological
weapon created at Fort Detrick. Although the Soviet Union no longer
exists, its propaganda remains, as people worldwide --- including
Americans --- still believe elements of its disinformation campaign
about AIDS more than 30 years after it began.]{.underline}**

**[One]{.underline}** person **[who does not need to be convinced about
the effectiveness of a disinformation campaign is Russian President
Vladimir Putin, who]{.underline}** was a member of the KGB from 1975 to
1990, and **[was able to see firsthand the outbreak of the AIDS epidemic
as well as Soviet efforts to indict the United States]{.underline}**.
Americans may never know for certain whether the success of the AIDS
disinformation campaign has influenced Putin's foreign policy, but at
the very least, it is worth considering. And **[it is a reminder of the
lasting effects disinformation campaigns can have, particularly when
they play off existing divisions in the United States.]{.underline}**

### AT -- NATO engages in Disinfo

#### Absent deterrence mechanisms the information battlefield is anarchic and inevitable - preemptive strikes are necessary.

The core puzzle of disinformation is therefore that [although it has
short-term strategic advantages, it has more significant reputational
and communicative costs to the Attacker in the medium-to-long
term]{.underline}, yet [Attackers nonetheless rely on disinformation
knowing that they will suffer from these costs]{.underline}. To that
end, the focus of this chapter is this ex-post inefficiency of
disinformation: why do countries engage in disinformation even though
they know that their ex-ante gains from it often dwarf in contrast to
their ex-post reputational costs? In Fearonian fashion, an IR-Realist
explanation of disinformation would fit into three broad categories:
anarchy, preventive action and positive expected utility.^33^ In terms
of anarchy, [the absence of a deterrence mechanism or a supranational
authority creates an international disinformation environment that
favours the Attacker]{.underline}. [Similar to cybersecurity debates
where the Attacker has a distinct advantage due to attribution problems
and mediocre chance of reprisals,^34^ disinformation too, is a domain
where the Attacker has a distinct timing and first-mover's advantage
against the Defender]{.underline}. Quite often, [a successful
disinformation campaign generates substantial shortterm benefit around
important time-sensitive events, even if such campaigns are debunked and
a counter disinformation offensive begins. To that end, the world of
global disinformation is a significantly anarchic domain.]{.underline}

[In a system dominated by anarchy and first-mover advantages,
preventative action becomes the norm. Attacker in an information war
finds initiating a campaign more preferable if it perceives that
information war **unavoidable.**]{.underline} [Since the disinformation
domain is anarchic and information war is perceived as inevitable, a
government will find the payoff of initiating a campaign greater than
the risk of not initiating, in order not to suffer from the penalties of
becoming a Defender by moving in late. To that end preemption becomes a
form of prevention: not of the information war, but of the costs of
suffering from the initial salvo.]{.underline}

## Democracy 

### Disinformation Undermines Trust

#### Disinformation undermines trust in government -- it is the greatest threat to liberal democracies

Executive Summary

On November 2, 2020, the Ottawa Citizen ran the front-page headline
"Canadian Military Wants to Establish New Organization to Use Propaganda
and Other Techniques to Influence Canadians." This seemed an
unbelievable story, and one initially denied by a spokesperson for the
minister of National Defense. Just three days later, though, then-chief
of the Defense Staff (CDS) Gen. Jonathan Vance shuttered the group in
question, terminating an initiative more than five years in the making
that called into question the Department of National Defense's (DND)
commitment to objective and appropriate public communication, at a time
when truth decay, **[misinformation and disinformation have gained much
traction around the world and in Canada. In June 2021,]{.underline}**
the day Parliament adjourned for the summer, DND acknowledged to select
media that acting CDS Lt.-Gen. Wayne Eyre and then-deputy minister Jody
Thomas had determined the initiative was "incompatible" with government
communications policy and the vision, mission and principles of DND
Public Affairs. In a surprising self-indictment, the **[leaders also
admitted a lack of "institution-wide strategic level direction and
guidance," to build information-related capabilities that were "governed
by appropriate authorities and oversight.]{.underline}**" Deliberate
**[influence campaigns by malign state, non-state and increasingly by
domestic actors to disturb, disrupt and create disorder in democratic
societies have become widespread and commonplace. The volume of vitriol
is increasing. This is fast eroding citizen faith, trust and confidence
in government and public institutions and may be the greatest
contemporary threat liberal democracies face]{.underline}** -- arresting
this trend and then restoring trust, the ultimate challenge. National
Defense's entire program -- to be successful on operations; secure
sufficient funding; recruit, train and retain; effect culture change;
reconstitute the force post-pandemic and procure the equipment needed to
contest, confront and defeat adversaries -- will largely depend on
whether the institution can modernize its approach to strategic
communications to maneuver more agilely and to better effect in a
complex, frenetic and hostile information environment. Recently,
National Defense has suffered a significant self-inflicted setback in
that regard.

### Disinformation Undermines Democratic Values

#### Russian disinformation undermines essential values of democracy in the U.S. as partisan divides grow 

**Gu, Universal Rights Group NYC Research Analyst 21** - \[Amanda,
3-16-2021, Universal Rights Group, \"Recent US report of Russian
election interference reveals how disinformation can exploit existing

Accessed 7-6-2022, LASA-LR\]

**[The effectiveness of these disinformation campaigns can be attributed
to the pre-existing partisan divides and growing distrust in expertise
in the US, which have only worsened after these attacks]{.underline}**.
According to the report, **[Russia's Internet Research Agency (IRA) used
its familiarity with US history, culture, and politics to exploit
existing political divisions by targeting individuals who feel strongly
about social issues ranging from racial and religious to party
political]{.underline}**, to 'issue political' such as feminist culture,
gun rights, and trust in media. **[Disinformation campaigns were then
used to activate or demobilise individuals who consider an issue
personally important, creating an 'us' vs. 'them'
discourse.]{.underline}**

**[Disinformation tactics have become significantly more widespread and
sophisticated as these online campaigns have come to rely on an
assortment of bots, propaganda producers, and fake news outlets to
exploit social media algorithms in order to propagate their message and
ensure that it is seamlessly integrated with trusted
content]{.underline}**. These often rely on pre-existing paths of
microtargeting created by advertisers and political campaigners through
the use and abuse of personal data. **[Social media is presently an
indispensable part of modern political campaigning,]{.underline}** and
there is a strong incentive for political campaigns to rely on
microtargeting techniques to reach constituents. And **[because this
targeted messaging only reaches select audiences, they are likely to
bypass journalistic scrutiny and deliver disinformation to individuals
unchallenged]{.underline}**. Quantity is valued over quality, as the
**[disinformation strategy relies on sheer mass to drown out real
news.]{.underline}**

Politicians are becoming increasingly reliant on social media to win
elections, and often use the same microtargeting techniques allegedly
used by Russia -- feeding fear and playing off partisan divides -- in
order to mudsling their way to victory. **[Disinformation tactics have
also benefited from the fact that those at the top in the US peddled
outlandish theories to their constituents,]{.underline}** **[normalising
and facilitating the spread of fake news.]{.underline}** Take for
example the issues of mail-in voting or election illegitimacy that were
pushed by Trump himself; Russian bots did not have to create new
rhetoric, but only had to spread pre-existing content.

**[These attacks on voters' rights to information and faith in the
electoral system have worsened the existing partisan divide in
America]{.underline}**. The world of 'alternative facts' produced by
online disinformation have created what appears to be two different
realities for the two American parties, a dangerous position that puts
political compromise, and hence the functioning of democracy, at risk.

Dangers to democracy

**[Disinformation campaigns are especially dangerous to democracies
because a well-informed electorate is a prerequisite to a stable
democracy]{.underline}**. **[When information becomes manipulated, it
damages citizens' ability to choose their leaders based on factual news
and authentic debate]{.underline}**. This right to information is
essential for voters who need to assess the performance of an elected
official and exercise their democratic rights effectively, such as
through timely protests.

**[Disinformation campaigns like the ones presented in the ICA report,
are not only able to manipulate the vital information individuals rely
on to participate in a democracy, but also can undermine the integrity
of the electoral system itself.]{.underline}** Unsubstantiated claims of
voter fraud or a stolen election propagates a fatalistic view that the
individual vote is powerless, discourages democratic participation, and
breeds a culture of mistrust. When the right to information is hindered,
this begins to chip away at public trust, eventually causing the
foundations of democracy to buckle.

### Democracy Good -- Prevents Conflict

#### The survival of democracy is key to maintaining peace

In this research note, we apply a nonparametric sensitivity analysis to
the democratic peace debate in international relations. **[We find that
the positive association between democracy and peace is at least five
times as robust as that between smoking and lung cancer. To explain away
the democratic peace, researchers would have to find confounders that
are many times more strongly associated with democracy and conflicts
than the confounders that have been identified until now. Since such
confounders have yet to be found, for now we conclude that the existing
empirical evidence overwhelmingly supports the democratic
peace.]{.underline}**

**[Though democracies sometimes become embroiled in conflicts with
non-democracies, they almost never fight each other]{.underline}**
(Russett & Oneal, 2001). Since the emergence of modern democracy in the
early 19th century, **[two mature democracies have never experienced
intense violent conflict with each other, incurring at least 1,000
battle dead]{.underline}**. The Correlates of War project and other data
sets have long classified a conflict as a war if it experiences at least
1,000 battle dead (Reiter et al., 2016). On the rare occasions when two
democracies have entered militarized disputes with each other, as in the
1898 Fashoda Crisis or the 1970s "Cod Wars" between Britain and Iceland,
they essentially always settle the conflict short of war.

There have been close calls of democracies nearly fighting wars against
each other. Mature democracies have sometimes fought repressive states
with some democratic elements, such as the United States fighting Spain
in the 1898 Spanish-American War (Ray, 1995). Democracies sometimes end
up as members of opposing coalitions, though in those cases the opposing
democracies avoid fighting each other. Democratic Finland fought
alongside the Axis in World War II, but experienced no combat with any
democratic members of the Allies. **[In the 1948 War of Israeli
Independence, a somewhat democratic Lebanon found itself allied with
Arab states against the new Israeli democracy, but Lebanon carefully
avoided direct clashes with Israel]{.underline}** (Morris, 2008, pp.
344, 348). In the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict, though Israel launched
strikes against Hezbollah forces based in Lebanese territory, Israel did
not declare war on democratic Lebanon and generally avoided attacking
Lebanese forces directly. Lebanon also mostly avoided attacking Israel
forces. **[Probably the closest instance of two democracies going to war
with each other was the 1999 Kargil War between India and Pakistan,
though that conflict experienced less than 1,000 battle
dead]{.underline}** (Reiter et al., 2016). More systematic studies have
also found that pairs of democratic states are less likely to experience
less intense violent, international conflicts than other pairs of states
(Russett & Oneal, 2001; Rousseau et al., 1996), though there is debate
over whether jointly democratic pairs of states are less likely to
experience non-war disputes as compared with all other pairs of states,
or just with pairs of states that include a democracy and a
non-democracy (Bennett & Stam, 2004).

Though there is strong consensus about the "dyadic" democratic peace,
that democracies do not fight each other, there is more debate about the
existence of other possible patterns of democratic peace. Many dispute
the existence of the "monadic" democratic peace, that democracies are
more likely to be peaceful in their relations with all states (Russett &
Oneal, 2001; for an early statement of the monadic democratic peace, see
Rummel, 1979). There is also debate over the existence of a "systemic"
democratic peace, whether making the international system or even a
region more democratic will make the system or region more peaceful
(Gleditsch, 2002; Mitchell et al., 1999).

### Russia-China Spreading Authoritarianism

#### Russian and Chinese disinformation operations are converging to undermine liberal democratic order

Compounds Threat to Democracy\",

accessed on 7-9-2022, MG\]

In recent weeks [the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) propaganda and
disinformation blitz around COVID-19 has drawn increasing attention, and
with good reason]{.underline}. [**In addition to promoting a narrative
about Beijing's global leadership around the pandemic, the Chinese
government has adopted Russian disinformation tactics in promoting
conspiracy theories purporting that COVID-19 originated in Europe, the
United States, and beyond to distract from its failed initial response
to contain the outbreak** from spreading beyond Wuhan.]{.underline}

**[Several accounts of China's information operations have noted the
incorporation of Russian disinformation tactics. Yet the full
significance of this development cannot be understood without
appreciating the broader alignment between Russia and
China.]{.underline}** In other words, [**China's adoption of Russian
information operation techniques is about more than "authoritarian
learning," or the passive diffusion of such practices from one
authoritarian regime to the next**. Instead, **Russia and China are
deepening ties and increasing coordination on a range of economic,
defense, technological, and political issues. These repeated
interactions facilitate an intentional sharing of best practices and are
building a foundation for sustained cooperation moving
forward.**]{.underline}

[Relations between Russia and China developed gradually after the Cold
War and accelerated dramatically in 2014 when Russia's illegal
annexation of Crimea and subsequent occupation of Ukraine shut down
Russian opportunities in and cooperation with Western
democracies.]{.underline} These events drove Russia toward China at a
time when the latter was demonstrating greater foreign policy
assertiveness under Xi Jinping. The CCP leadership was increasingly
concerned about perceived Western efforts to foment "color revolutions"
in the wake of the Arab Spring, the advent of the Umbrella Movement in
Hong Kong, and Washington's "pivot to Asia." [Since then, **there has
been an increasing convergence between Moscow and Beijing's views of how
the world should be ordered. The two governments are finding common
cause in undermining liberal democratic norms and institutions,
weakening cohesion among democratic allies and partners, and reducing
U.S. global influence.**]{.underline}

[Historically, Beijing and Moscow have taken different approaches to
advancing these shared foreign policy objectives. **The Kremlin has
sought to sow confusion and exploit divisions to polarize public
debates, whereas China has used subtler tactics conducive to building
economic ties and influence while shaping positive perceptions of
China.** **China's disinformation during the pandemic, however, has
evinced a newfound willingness to deploy the Kremlin's techniques.
Beijing has promoted elaborate conspiracy theories about the pandemic's
origins to inject confusion into global narratives**, including one
particularly sophisticated scheme by the Chinese Foreign Ministry's
Information Department to pin blame on the U.S.]{.underline}

[China's efforts to burnish its standing as a net provider of public
goods during the pandemic have also benefited from Russia's example.
During a two-week period in March 2020, for example, nearly 50,000
tweets flooded the Twittersphere with pro-China hashtags.]{.underline}
Notably, nearly half of Tweets featuring the hashtag "forzaCinaeItalia"
(Go China, Go Italy) and more than a third of Tweets featuring the
hashtag "grazieCina" (thank you China) stemmed from bots---a
quintessentially Russian tool that Chinese operations have increasingly
leveraged---that averaged more than 50 tweets per day.

[**As Russia-China relations continue to deepen, the exchange of best
practices and cross-border learning of disinformation tactics will
become increasingly hardwired into the interactions between them. The
two countries' state media organizations are increasingly collaborating
with an eye toward formulating common messaging to counter "Western
influence" and promote positive stories about Russian and Chinese
leadership in the world.** There is a particular focus on digital media
platforms, where the two countries have pledged cooperation to combat
"illegal online content."]{.underline}

[**As they work toward shared objectives, their efforts will produce
dangerous synergies that will pose growing problems for democracies.**
Already, Russia and China have an implicit tactical division of labor.
**Russia propagates narratives designed to undermine trust in
institutions, creating fertile ground for Chinese narratives about the
failings of democracy and superiority of authoritarian systems to take
root.**]{.underline} Likewise, [**as Moscow and Beijing work toward
shared objectives they will be increasingly singing from the same sheet
of music, amplifying a common message about the flaws and failures of
Western democracy and the need for an alternative, supposedly
values-free vision for globalization and development.** Russian state
media have already propagated pro-Beijing views on a range of topics
(and vice versa), forging a symbiotic relationship that supports the
creation of an alternative information ecosystem in which truth is
called into question.]{.underline} **[Moving forward, Russia and China
will find other common causes where leveraging each other's platforms
and propaganda will broaden their collective reach and
impact.]{.underline}**

[The once bright line between CCP and Kremlin disinformation tactics has
grown fuzzy. During the pandemic, Beijing has demonstrated a willingness
to use disinformation to confuse global audiences and maliciously
discredit democracies to protect the CCP's reputation and promote China
as a responsible global leader by comparison.]{.underline} [**Democratic
countries must prepare for a future where information operations are
increasingly utilized by both China and Russia in their varied but
compounding efforts to undermine liberal norms and democratic
institutions, while also popularizing aspects of authoritarianism.**
Good governance, aggressive independent media, and deep understanding of
disinformation tactics will be critical to exposing and countering
Chinese and Russian efforts to distort the truth to advance their
interests. **Leading democracies must renew their global leadership and
reinvest in their relationships around the world. When it comes to
protecting the information environment, a good offense is truly the best
defense.**]{.underline}

#### China and Russia cyber-attacks are not mutually exclusive, and both undermine democracies that have previously sustained peace throughout Europe

Until recently, Russian and Chinese influence across Europe generally
reflected their distinct strategic aims. But their interests
increasingly converge**[. Common to both Vladimir Putin's and Xi
Jinping's strategies is the decoupling of the United States and
Europe.]{.underline}** **[Leaders on both sides of the Atlantic will
have to act in concert -- and fast -- to forestall an]{.underline}**
**[even greater corrosion of the democratic norms that have kept the
peace]{.underline}** -- or helped restore it, in the case of the wars in
the former Yugoslavia -- for three-quarters of a century.

**[Russia and China have made particular inroads in Central and
Southeastern Europe in recent years.]{.underline}** **[Putin's
government identifies dissatisfied segments of the public and the
political class and maliciously exploits vulnerabilities via
disinformation and related propaganda to exacerbate divisions, hinder
democratic institutions, and generally neutralize the European space,
particularly in the Balkans]{.underline}** and the "Visegrad Four"
countries of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Xi's
multiple and insidious charm offensives, on the other hand, have been
comparatively apolitical, being less concerned about democratic or
authoritarian governance and more aimed at bolstering the Chinese
Communist Party's global legitimacy, especially among political,
business, and intellectual elites.

**[Neither Moscow's nor Beijing's approaches and tactics are mutually
exclusive]{.underline}**. **[Russian state, military, and religious
leadership affirmatively engage aligned or sympathetic elites, while
China uses media proxies to steer public discourse in its favor on its
priority issues]{.underline}** --- Hong Kong's autonomy, Taiwan's de
facto independence, and the human rights of China's Uyghur and Tibetan
communities.

**[To the delight of both Russia and China, the gradual weakening of
U.S.-European ties over the last two decades is accelerating due to
mutual neglect, miscommunication, and diminished policy coordination in
a post-Cold War world]{.underline}**. It hasn't helped that the Trump
administration's approach to resolving inequities in NATO member
defense-spending commitments or aspects of transatlantic trade relations
has been nearly all vinegar and little wine. **[The result is rapidly
diminishing support for partnership with America in key ally states such
as Germany]{.underline}**. According to a Pew Research poll in April,
almost as many Germans prioritized their country's relationship with
China -- 36 percent -- as with the United States (37 percent). That was
a significant change from a year earlier, when 50 percent of Germans
preferred a closer partnership with the United States, compared with 24
percent favoring better ties with China.

**[Washington's unhelpful bellicosity understandably alienates many
Europeans, making it all the more difficult for their elected leaders to
work jointly even on common interests]{.underline}**. This reciprocal
disengagement between Washington and key European capitals leaves room,
in turn, for adversarial interventions by Russia and China.

### China Threat Now

#### China is fraying the international order and threatening international security now

**Beckley, Harvard international security fellow, 22**

\[Michael Beckley, 4/2022, Foreign Affairs, "Enemies of My Enemy: How
Fear of China Is Forging a New World Order.",

Accessed 7-8-2022, LASA-LR\]

**[The international order is falling apart, and everyone seems to know
how to fix it.]{.underline}** According to some, the United States just
needs to rededicate itself to leading the liberal order it helped found
some 75 years ago. Others argue that the world\'s great powers should
form a concert to guide the international community into a new age of
multipolar cooperation. Still others call for a grand bargain that
divides the globe into stable spheres of influence. What these and other
visions of international order have in common is an assumption that
global governance can be designed and imposed from the top down**[. With
wise statesmanship and ample summitry, the international jungle can be
tamed and cultivated. Conflicts of interest and historical hatreds can
be negotiated away and replaced with win-win cooperation.]{.underline}**

**[The history of international order, however, provides little reason
for confidence in top-down, cooperative solutions.]{.underline}** **[The
strongest orders in modern history\--from Westphalia in the seventeenth
century to the liberal international order in the twentieth\--were not
inclusive organizations working for the greater good of humanity.
Rather, they were alliances built by great powers to wage security
competition against their main rivals]{.underline}**. Fear and loathing
of a shared enemy, not enlightened calls to make the world a better
place, brought these orders together. Progress on transnational issues,
when achieved, emerged largely as a byproduct of hardheaded security
cooperation. That cooperation usually lasted only as long as a common
threat remained both present and manageable. When that threat dissipated
or grew too large, the orders collapsed. **[Today, the liberal order is
fraying for many reasons, but the underlying cause is that the threat it
was originally designed to defeat\--Soviet communism\--disappeared three
decades ago]{.underline}**. **[None of the proposed replacements to the
current order have stuck because there hasn\'t been a threat scary or
vivid enough to compel sustained cooperation among the key
players.]{.underline}**

Until now. **[Through a surge of repression and aggression, China has
frightened countries near and far. It is acting belligerently in East
Asia, trying to carve out exclusive economic zones in the global
economy, and exporting digital systems that make authoritarianism more
effective than ever. For the first time since the Cold War, a critical
mass of countries face serious threats to their security]{.underline}**,
welfare, and ways of life\--all emanating from a single source.

This moment of clarity has triggered a flurry of responses. **[China\'s
neighbors are arming themselves and aligning with outside powers to
secure their territory and sea-lanes]{.underline}**. **[Many of the
world\'s largest economies are collectively developing new trade,
investment, and technology standards that implicitly discriminate
against China.]{.underline}** Democracies are gathering to devise
strategies for combating authoritarianism at home and abroad, and new
international organizations are popping up to coordinate the battle.
Seen in real time, these efforts look scattershot. Step back from the
day-to-day commotion, however, and a fuller picture emerges: for better
or worse, competition with China is forging a new international order.

#### China must be checked to avoid escalating conflict, in recent years it has gone on the complete offensive with updated defense and economic exploitation

Accessed 7-8-2022, LASA-LR\]

**[This threat is most apparent in maritime East Asia, where China is
moving aggressively to cement its vast territorial
claims]{.underline}**. **[Beijing is churning out warships faster than
any country has since World War II, and it has flooded Asian sea-lanes
with Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels.]{.underline}** **[It has
strung military outposts across the South China Sea and dramatically
increased its use of ship ramming and aerial interceptions to shove
neighbors out of disputed areas]{.underline}**. In the Taiwan Strait,
Chinese military patrols, some involving a dozen warships and more than
50 combat aircraft, prowl the sea almost daily and simulate attacks on
Taiwanese and U.S. targets. **[Chinese officials have told Western
analysts that calls for an invasion of Taiwan are proliferating within
the CCP. Pentagon officials worry that such an assault could be
imminent.]{.underline}**

**[China has gone on the economic offensive, too. Its latest five-year
plan calls for dominating what Chinese officials call
\"chokepoints\"\--goods and services that other countries can\'t live
without\--and then using that dominance, plus the lure of China\'s
domestic market, to browbeat countries into concessions.]{.underline}**
Toward that end, China has become the dominant dispenser of overseas
loans, loading up more than 150 countries with over \$1 trillion of
debt. It has massively subsidized strategic industries to gain a
monopoly on hundreds of vital products, and it has installed the
hardware for digital networks in dozens of countries. Armed with
economic leverage, it has used coercion against more than a dozen
countries over the last few years. In many cases, the punishment has
been disproportionate to the supposed crime\--for example, slapping
tariffs on many of Australia\'s exports after that country requested an
international investigation into the origins of covid-19.

**[China has also become a potent antidemocratic force, selling advanced
tools of tyranny around the world]{.underline}**. By combining
surveillance cameras with social media monitoring, artificial
intelligence, biometrics, and speech and facial recognition
technologies, **[the Chinese government has pioneered a system that
allows dictators to watch citizens constantly and punish them instantly
by blocking their access to fnance, education, employment,
telecommunications, or travel]{.underline}**. **[The apparatus is a
despot\'s dream, and Chinese companies are already selling and operating
aspects of it in more than 80 countries.]{.underline}**

### Democratic Counter-Disinfo Key

#### Democracies are key to outcompeting a China/Russia alliance

Studies Henry A. Kissinger Distinguished Professor, 22**

The economic trauma of the Ukraine War is only beginning: Energy shocks,
food-supply disruption and commodity shortages will have growing impact
as the conflict persists. The war, moreover, is just part of an
accelerating geo-economic realignment.

[**The golden age of globalization, when countries pursued
interdependence with minimal fear of insecurity, is over.** The global
economy is now being reshaped by competition and conflict. **That will
create some opportunities for the US to strengthen its
position**]{.underline} --- [as well as a whole lot of worldwide
turmoil.]{.underline}

A [remarkable aspect of the post-Cold War era was that calculations of
economic efficiency so often trumped calculations of geopolitical
risk.]{.underline} An era that began with the fall of the Berlin Wall
was dominated by the pursuit of integration across traditional strategic
divides.

[A web of trade, financial and technological ties developed between
China and the world's democracies. European countries became highly
reliant on Russian energy (notably Germany) and investment (the UK). The
pursuit of profit was accompanied by a diplomatic rationale --- that
economic entanglement would create a common interest in global
stability, mitigating whatever dangers might otherwise result from
trading with a prospective enemy.]{.underline}

[That rationale proved faulty. Globalization increased Chinese and
Russian capabilities without meaningfully decreasing their
ambitions.]{.underline} By the mid-2010s, global tensions were
increasing and interdependence came to be seen as a source of
vulnerability.

Worried that Beijing might translate technological primacy into
geopolitical primacy, President Donald Trump's administration urged
other nations to wall off their 5G telecommunications networks against
Chinese influence. t sought to forestall completion of the Nord Stream
pipeline between Russia and Germany, lest Europe become diplomatically
paralyzed by dependence on Moscow's energy.

[When Beijing then threatened to withhold critical pharmaceutical
components amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it showed how complex supply
chains could be wielded as strategic weapons.]{.underline}

[In this context, the war in Ukraine has thrown global integration into
reverse. Western companies that pushed into Russia after the Cold War
are being forced to flee]{.underline}, with McDonald's Corp. being the
latest (and perhaps most symbolic). [US export controls have severed
Russia's access to advanced semiconductors; Germany and other European
democracies are rapidly undoing decades of economic
engagement.]{.underline} This conflict-driven decoupling may simply be a
preview of what comes next.

[President Xi Jinping's China was already pursuing]{.underline} what
Matthew Pottinger, deputy national security adviser in the Trump
administration, calls an "offensive decoupling" strategy --- [a program
meant to insulate the country from Western pressure and give it
tremendous coercive power by dominating critical
technologies.]{.underline} Xi's "dual circulation" program is meant to
develop China's internal market and make the country less reliant on
external markets that might slam shut in a crisis.

It seems inevitable that this campaign will accelerate. [China, whose
relations with Washington are in a nosedive, can hardly leave itself
susceptible to the sort of punishment the US and its allies have imposed
on Moscow.]{.underline}

Similar processes are underway across the democratic world. Europe is
moving to wean itself off Russian oil and natural gas. The US is
considering sharper curbs on investment in China; Treasury Secretary
Janet Yellen is pushing "friend-shoring," or relocating production to
countries aligned with Washington.

The administration of President Joe Biden is also working with allies,
such as Japan, to create technological supply chains and innovation
ecosystems that leave China on the outside.

#### Focus on democratic values key to preventing Russia-China authoritarian axis

States Representative, and Simon, Staffordshire University Defense
Studies Editor-In-Chief Associate Professor, 6-28-2022, War on the

Rocks\", https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/dont-let-russia-dominate-the-strategic-concept/, accessed

As the trans-Atlantic community focuses on the Russo-Ukrainian war,
rivalry with China continues apace. [Scholars and policymakers differ on
conceptual approaches to this dual dynami]{.underline}c, with some
arguing for a geographic division of labor both within Europe and across
the Atlantic, and others maintaining that, because Europe is less than
the sum of its parts, U.S. military leadership remains indispensable.

[Identifying a role for NATO in the Indo-Pacific is exceptionally
challenging.]{.underline} Whether by Europeanizing NATO to enable the
United States to focus on the Indo-Pacific, contending with Chinese
commercial investment in European critical infrastructure, or
encouraging allies to engage in Asia themselves (individually or
collectively), the new strategic concept must address the relationship
between the trans-Atlantic community and China. [**At an absolute
minimum, the strategic concept should position NATO to support the
current global order and "demonstrate its commitment to security and
democratic values as well as to the peaceful resolution of disputes."
Such a concerted approach to China is certainly attainable: Chinese
behavior may even have "brought NATO together" in ways analogous to
Russian behavior, and there may be more room for economic convergence
between China and the West than sometimes imagined.**]{.underline}

**[A significant strategic concern for NATO allies is to avoid
precipitating a Russian-Chinese authoritarian alignment. While Russia
and China face distinct strategic challenges of their own and their
"unlimited partnership" has appeared to stumble upon some limits, their
continued pursuit of emerging, disruptive technologies and their
authoritarian models of governance present significant risks to NATO
allies. These models, coupled with Russia and China's shared willingness
to undermine national and international institutions in the
trans-Atlantic community, mean that the most daunting threat NATO faces
may be to its foundational values. Incorporating these core values into
strategy and policy will be a key task for the 2022 Strategic
Concept.]{.underline}**

**[Global warming, including other negative environmental developments,
has several implications and ramifications]{.underline}**. **[It is
related to the survival of human civilization. However, there is
apparently also a direct nexus of global warming to
democracy]{.underline}**. **[The tensions that global warming is
creating also pose a direct threat to democracy, as poor (or decreasing)
environmental performance may constrain freedom by favoring
authoritarian tendencies]{.underline}**. Therefore, the prevalence of
democracy in the world will also require the implementation of solutions
and problem-solving regarding important ecological themes. **[The
prospering of democracy is also tied to the environmental challenge of
sustainability.]{.underline}**

Future research efforts should examine additional data that can better
explain factors related to climate change and global warming, such as
rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and etc.
in the context of socio-political, socio-economic, and socio-technical
dynamics. **[Furthermore, mitigation and adaptation policies to climate
change may also explain the relation between democracy and
environment]{.underline}**. **[Climate change is a global issue that
requires global cooperation and long-term commitments; the quality of
democracy, therefore, is a key factor. As noted by several scholars,
democracies are characterized by the free flow of information regarding
problems and solutions, increased administrative capacities, lower
levels of corruption, improved scientific and technical capacity, and
dynamic, innovative economies \[90,91]{.underline}**\]. In this context,
under a Quadruple and Quintuple Helix approach (Quadruple and Quintuple
Innovation Helix Frameworks), it will be interesting to examine the role
of civil society and innovation in a more holistic
environment-democracy-innovation nexus.

#### Democracies are essential to developing effective, sustainable environmental programs

What this correlation tells us is that, simply: **[The higher the
political freedom in a country, the more likely it is to have a higher
environmental performa]{.underline}**nce. **[Similarly, the lower the
political freedom in a country the more likely it is to have a lower
environmental performance]{.underline}**. Of course, since Pearson's
correlation coefficient is not able to identify cause and effect, the
previous findings need further analysis, validation, and justification
in order to understand the aforementioned interrelations.

However, it should be stressed that correlation is not causation. **[We
should consider that it is almost impossible to suggest that results
show causal determinism, which might imply that lower environmental
performances are automatically interlinked with authoritarianism or lead
to authoritarianism]{.underline}**. Moreover, the presented results may
indicate a spurious correlation, despite the existence of studies that
justify the interrelations between democracy and the environment.
Therefore, in order to confirm that aforementioned correlations are
sound, additional variables should be considered in order to model an
integrated dynamic environment-democracy system (see also \[89\]).
Consequently, the democracy-environment nexus. Simultaneously, it should
be emphasized that such early-stage correlative work can help in the
preparation of later work with more advanced statistical means.

#### Democracy promotes the sharing of citizen's ideas, and allows for more climate action to transpire due to the value they place on listening to their populace

**[Adams and Acheampong (2019) emphasized that democracy promotes civic
competence and gives awareness to citizens for differentiating public
and individual interests. Democracy gives freedom of choice to
individuals; therefore, citizens could freely choose the environmental
policies by the voting mechanism]{.underline}**. Moreover, autocratic
regimes fail to provide public goods; hence, the provision of a clean
and sustainable environment may not be achieved in autocracies (Olson
1996). **[According to Payne (1995), individuals are free to learn about
the environment and ecological policies and can express their opinions,
priorities, and putting political pressure on the government through
voting (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006).]{.underline}** **[Moreover, in
democratic systems, individuals have greater access to information about
environmental issues through freedom of the press. They also have the
right to organize and lobby for environmental protection at both
national and international levels (Kinda 2011).]{.underline}** Pande
(2003) points out that "a basic premise of representative democracy is
that all those subject to policy should have a voice in its making."
**[Therefore, individuals living in democratic societies have more
influence than those living in autocratic systems in which people are
not allowed to express opinions on socioeconomic or ecological
issues.]{.underline}** Thus, demands for better environmental quality
can be easily transmitted in the decision-making process and can force
leaders to raise environmental standards. **[McCloskey (1983) and Payne
(1995) assert that democratic governments are more sensitive to
individual demands on ecological issues, which could encourage them to
fulfill responsibilities and commitments under international treaties.
Moreover, they emphasize that in autocratic systems individuals are not
allowed to freely express their opinion on socio-economic issues, as
well as ecological ones, they are not allowed to organize, and access to
information without no cost is almost impossible.]{.underline}**

Online communication has introduced new means to disguise or
misrepresent the authors and amplifiers of communication. The impact of
these developments is complex as [anonymity promotes inclusion or
exclusion in different contexts]{.underline} (Asenbaum 2018). [Anonymity
or pseudonymity can enable people to speak their minds without fearing
repercussions for expressing views that could face social sanction or
government repression. Techniques to disguise one's identity may be
important measures to counteract the increased capacities of digital
media systems for state and corporate surveillance. Among other benefits
for deliberative systems, this can enhance inclusion and expose a "false
impression of conformity" of opinion on issues]{.underline} (Moore 2018,
182).

However, [the possibility for social media users to disguise their
identity can also enable manipulative and unaccountable
communication]{.underline}. [Disinformation actors regularly
misrepresent their identities through the use of "sock
puppets"]{.underline} (fake accounts operated by humans) [or "political
bots"]{.underline} ("algorithms that operate over social media, written
to learn from and mimic real people," Woolley and Howard 2016, 4885). As
Moore (2018, 182) puts it, [the misrepresentation of identity "leaves
the listener unable to judge the interests, agendas, and biases of the
speaker, and thereby creates opportunities for strategic and deceptive
communication."]{.underline} A similar problem applies to fake news
organizations, think tanks, and government agencies. [Because all
sources of content tend to look the same on social media, users often
suffer "source blindness" and do not apply the interpretive shortcuts
they would otherwise use to assess source credibility]{.underline}
(Pearson 2020).

The ability to misrepresent identities on social media is one of many
means by which social media can reduce accountability. Most basically,
[some individuals can push false and insulting messages online, even
using a real name, knowing that violations of social norms are unlikely
to lead to sanctions in their off-line lives.]{.underline}
[Disinformation actors can micro-target messages to audiences in ways
that avoid detection by more critical publics and they can engage in
transnational operations, knowing that it is difficult or impossible for
state authorities to enforce their laws outside their
jurisdiction.]{.underline}

[Democracies must protect citizens' opportunities to contribute to
public discussion, especially in the wild public sphere; prevent
communication from being overwhelmed by coercive, economic, or other
forms of dominating power; and support transmission mechanisms that
facilitate accountability and responsiveness of empowered sites of
discourse. Media regulation is fraught due to threats of capture by the
state, political factions, and economic actors, and all democracies
regulate mass media in ways that grapple with these tensions. However,
social media companies have evaded many forms of accountability and
public oversight that apply to other mass media companies.]{.underline}

Disinformation, fake news and---since the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in
2020---"infodemics" have been added to the vocabulary of societies
across the world. Often conflated with other terms including
misinformation, tainted leaks, and propaganda, **[disinformation is the

trust, and undermine democratic discourse and practices. It has become a
catch-all for information manipulation operations and has fundamentally

The Threat of Disinformation

**[Disinformation is used strategically to challenge the very
foundations of liberal democracy and of transatlantic relations by
affecting political decision-making, societies, and the very functioning
of democratic institutions.]{.underline}** **[Political warfare and
disinformation allow authoritarian regimes to present the authoritarian
governance model---and]{.underline}** during COVID-19 **[its crisis
management---as a superior alternative to democracy]{.underline}**.2
Given the magnitude and resources of their state-owned media operations
and global ambitions, **[Russia and increasingly China are the most
prominent authoritarian adversaries]{.underline}** for the transatlantic
Alliance.3 **[But the use of disinformation is proliferating among a
multitude of state and nonstate actors, including]{.underline}** most
notoriously the Islamic State (**[ISIS]{.underline}**). US law
enforcement agencies noted in a report about foreign interference in the
2020 elections that **[Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba are also present in
this space, as well as other nonstate actors like
Hizballah]{.underline}**.4 Worryingly, various actors within democratic
societies and NATO members are also turning to disinformation and
information suppression to advance their political goals domestically.5
A prominent tool of political warfare during the Cold War---Soviet
campaigns of "active measures" and dezinformatsiya6---**[propaganda and
disinformation went under the radar for the better part of the past 30
years in the West. The Kremlin's military aggression]{.underline}** in
Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea **[in 2014]{.underline}**
**[revealed Russia's use of information as a weapon, amplified and
strengthened by modern technologies, social media, and a revamped
state-media apparatus.]{.underline}** **[Disinformation campaigns became
a central tool for denying, justifying, and supporting its actions in
Ukraine. It created an alternate reality meant not only to obscure
Russia's involvement, but also to completely discredit theidea of
factuality, truth, and trust in the possibility or mere existence of
facts ("implausible deniability")]{.underline}**.7 **[This became a core
tactic for the Kremlin's power projection in Europe]{.underline}** and
particularly in former Soviet or satellite states. The attempt by
pro-Kremlin actors to influence **[the 2016 US election was another
turning point. It revealed the vulnerability of consolidated democracies
and the irrelevance of geography when it comes to new modes of political
warfare.]{.underline}** **[Disinformation and other means of malign
influence build over time, prey on local conditions, prime audiences for
future attacks and are mobilized at crucial moments]{.underline}** such
as elections, requiring significant resources to investigate and uncover
them. **[Disinformation is deployed as a force multiplier, part of a
toolkit of malign influence tactics to ensure the success of broader
strategic aims.]{.underline}**8 **[These can be military operations,
such as Russia's war against Georgia]{.underline}** and Ukraine or its
intervention in Syria, **[or intelligence operations,]{.underline}**
such as the Skripal poisoning case in the United Kingdom, whereby the
Kremlin sought to provide a cover for its unlawful incursion on UK
territory in a cloud of disinformation and competing narratives.
**[During the first peak of the COVID-19 crisis, the use of
disinformation, propaganda, and coordinated digital deception by both
Russia and China went hand in hand with so-called 'mask diplomacy,' a
media strategy accompanying the delivery of medical supplies by Russia
and China to Europe]{.underline}**.9 **[These information operations
were meant to highlight the]{.underline}** European Union **[(EU) and
NATO's lack of solidarity with their members and incapacity to act
swiftly and effectively]{.underline}**. China also branded a new, more
aggressive approach to engaging with Western counterparts---so-called
'wolf-warrior diplomacy'---both in official communication and by
leveraging its state media and an increased social media presence.10

**[Disinformation has become a weapon to undermine and potentially
distort the outcomes of democratic elections, introduce wedges in the
transatlantic alliance, deepen public health crises, and change the
nature of conflict.]{.underline}** Thus, **[the salience of
disinformation has grown exponentially]{.underline}** among researchers,
civil society, and policy makers in civilian and military structures
alike. **[Increasingly, military structures are]{.underline}**
**[starting to incorporate countering disinformation in their
strategies11]{.underline}** **[because ambiguity and masked intentions
could negate readiness and delay reinforcement.]{.underline}**12
**[Supranational structures like the EU, NATO, and G-7 also have
dedicated programming on tackling disinformation.]{.underline}** With
this, **[it has become a pressing national and transatlantic security
threat and poses a long-term existential challenge to the values and
principles underpinning the North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}**.

#### Ukraine is undermining alliance China strategy

[When NATO members agree on a new Strategic Concept at their summit in
Madrid, Russia's invasion of Ukraine will dominate the discussion. **But
with this existential crisis rightfully taking center stage, other
threats have not gone away.**]{.underline} The challenge for NATO is to
situate Russia's invasion in a wider strategic context, addressing other
key issues before they create new existential crises in the future.

What does this mean in practice? [We contend that despite the current
centrality of the Russo-Ukrainian war, Sino-American rivalry is likely
to drive U.S. national security thinking in the coming decades. NATO's
2022 Strategic Concept should address this reality. Among the many
challenges in Asi]{.underline}a and the broader Indo-Pacific, [**China's
designs on Taiwan figure most prominently. China is watching the
Russo-Ukrainian war closely, seeking to draw strategic lessons.** This
dynamic need not be catastrophic for European and trans-Atlantic
security. It creates opportunities for E.U.-NATO cooperation and greater
European strategic autonomy (or strategic responsibility) in the context
of an enduring trans-Atlantic bond.]{.underline} Europe and Asia are
increasingly linked as two theaters in a global system hinging on the
United States and anchored in its alliances in both regions. [The
strategic concept should thus lay out a vision for how NATO can
simultaneously compete with both China and Russia.]{.underline}

### Internal Link -- Disinformation Undermines Alliance

#### Erosion of truth breaks down alliances

**Grimes, Committee for Skeptical Inquiry post-doctoral fellow,**
**22** 

(David Robert, 3-28-2022, Scientific American, \"Russian Misinformation
Seeks to Confound, Not
Convince\", https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/russian-misinformation-seeks-to-confound-not-convince/, accessed
on 7-6-2022, SR)

[Rather than take a side, these campaigns create decision paralysis that
leads to inaction]{.underline}

As war envelops Ukraine, Russian sources have strived to create a miasma
of disinformation about the invasion. [Among ample efforts to distort
reality, the Russian Ministry of Defense asserted recently that
U.S.-backed labs in Ukraine have been developing
bioweapons.]{.underline} Outlandish as this falsehood may be, Fox's
Tucker Carlson gave it credence by arguing that the U.S. government's
response was a "cover-up."

As the Russia-Ukraine war intensifies, so too will the flow of
disinformation. This is an age-old strategy Russia has long history of
employing, and a playbook that others, most notably anti-vaccine
activists, have borrowed from liberally. [Yet, rather than focusing
effort on convincing people of a falsehood, the Russian strategy takes a
tack reminiscent of a strategy long employed by the tobacco industry: to
sow so much doubt about what is true that it sends people into decision
paralysis. Faced with a cacophony of wild and conflicting claims, people
do nothing, unsure of what is right.]{.underline}

Despite constituting only a small part of our media diet,
[disinformation campaigns]{.underline}, in our digital world, [can be
devastatingly effective.]{.underline} We are intrinsically biased
towards information that is emotionally visceral. We afford more weight
to content that frightens or outrages us, with the ability to induce
anger serving as the single greatest predictor of whether content goes
viral. This propels the most visceral, divisive narratives to the
forefront of discourse, creating a sound and fury of passionately
debated claims and counter claims. In that atmosphere, it becomes
increasingly difficult to ascertain what to believe, and easy to abandon
the task of discerning the truth.

If we are not to fall victim to such rank dishonesty, it is crucial now
that we question our sources more carefully than ever before.

Indecision and distraction have long been central to Russia's
dezinformatsiya (disinformation) policy, a term Stalin himself is
credited with coining. While an ancient concept, Russia had by the
imperial age mastered dark obfuscation techniques refined for the era of
mass communication. By the dawn of the Soviet empire, they realized this
potential on an industrial scale, establishing the world\'s first office
dedicated to disinformation in 1923. In the 1960s, the KGB covertly
sponsored American fringe groups, amplifying conspiratorial narratives
about everything from the assassination of president John F. Kennedy to
water fluoridation.

[The goal]{.underline}, as KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin elucidated in
1998, **[was "not intelligence collection, but subversion: active
measures to weaken the West, to drive wedges in the Western community
alliances of all sorts, particularly NATO, to sow discord among allies,
to weaken the United States in the eyes of the people of Europe, Asia,
Africa, Latin America\...."]{.underline}**. Operation INFEKTION, a
mid-1980s clandestine effort to spread the myth that AIDS was a
CIA-designed bioweapon, was but one infamous exemplar. While utterly
fictious, it resonated with communities ravaged by HIV and neglected by
the callous indifference of the Reagan administration. Despite Russian
intelligence taking responsibility for this lie in 1992, the legacy of
AIDS denialism persists to this day worldwide.

During the Cold War, the doctrine of "active measures" was the beating
heart of Soviet intelligence. This philosophy of political and
information warfare had wide remit, including front groups, media
manipulation, counterfeiting, infiltrating peace groups and even the
occasional assassination.

And in our media-saturated era, Russia has been, by far,
disinformation's most enthusiastic user. Take the 2016 U.S. presidential
election and the contentious Brexit referendum; Russia appears to have
influenced both via lies and distortions.

But disinformation is not solely confined to geopolitics. By summer
2020, the European Commission identified a concerted Russian drive to
propagate COVID disinformation worldwide. From the outset of the
pandemic, [Kremlin-backed troll farms pushed the narrative that COVID
was an engineered bioweapon, peddling the explosive fiction that 5G
radio frequencies caused the virus---a lie that resulted in dozens of
arson attacks on cell towers worldwide.]{.underline}

There is a dark irony in the observation that conspiracy-minded people
can be weaponized in plots to which they're entirely oblivious. The
enduring popularity of the virus-as-a-bioweapon mantra is a stark
reminder that in the age of social media, such manipulation has become
ever easier and more effective. Perhaps the most odious example of this
is the cynical rise of anti-vaccine propaganda.

The sheer efficacy of vaccination is scientifically incontrovertible,
and after clean water, immunization is the most life-saving intervention
in human history. Despite this, the last decade has witnessed
precipitous drops in vaccine confidence worldwide. The renaissance of
once-virtually-conquered diseases prompted the WHO to declare vaccine
hesitancy a top-10 threat to public health in 2019.

Sign up for Scientific American's free newsletters.

Vaccine hesitancy is a spectrum rather than a simple binary, and
exposure to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories nudges recipients towards
rejection. But critically, [many who decline vaccination are
not]{.underline} dyed-in-the-wool [anti-vaccine zealots, but simply
scared by what they have heard, unsure what to believe.]{.underline} Our
tendency towards the illusory truth effect exacerbates this inertia, as
the mere repetition of a fiction is enough to prime us to accept it,
even if we know it to be false on an intellectual level. While Russia
has often amplified anti-vaccine conspiracy theories to increase
tensions, the anti-vaccine movements exist independently of these
efforts, and are masters at sowing the seeds of doubt with torrents of
conflicting and emotive claims.

This illustrates the grim reality that disinformation has no need for
consistency and zero commitment to objective reality; claims are
frequently contradictory, arguing both sides of the coin in exaggerated
and divisive ways. This ["Russian firehose" model of
propaganda]{.underline} is high-output, contradictory and multichannel.
The stream [encourages us to sleepwalk into apathy, distrustful of
everything. This renders us supremely malleable, and dangerously
disengaged.]{.underline}

When it comes to vaccination, concerned parents often opt to stay with
the devil they know, delaying or even rejecting vaccination rather than
sifting through the symphony of conflicting claims to which they're
subjected. Similarly, the outpouring of fictions about Ukraine, its
president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and the war is designed to overwhelm our
capacity to analyze, inducing us to implicitly accept uncertainty over
aggressor and aggrieved---a manufactured doubt benefitting Russia and
other nations.

**[Conviction is not the chief goal of disinformation; instilling doubt
is.]{.underline}** This is why anti-vaccine activists have been so
successful online, and why Russian troll-farms push ample resources into
hawking lies virtually everywhere. The ubiquity of these fictions gives
them an implicit veneer of legitimacy, fueling polarization and
distrust.

This is the strategy Putin continues to pursue; already Russian
propaganda has tried to paint Ukraine (or NATO / America) as aggressors
with staged disinformation. This has been rendered less effective by the
Biden administration's creative approach of releasing intelligence prior
to the operation. [Across social media, Russian front organizations
still try to induce doubt, efforts that will only intensify as the war
wages on.]{.underline} Truth, the old adage insists, is the first
casualty of war.

#### Russian disinformation campaigns break down alliances and democratic norms

[**Even though Russian information warfare is not a new concept, it
still poses a massive risk to U.S. democracy and its ability to act on
the international stage**. To better understand the threat, it is
important to understand why Russia is using informational warfare
against the US, what Russia's goals are, and what the Kremlin is
targeting]{.underline}

[All actions taken by the Kremlin are carried out to achieve Russia's
geopolitical goals, including preserving its zone of influence in the
countries of the former Soviet Union, attaining desirable opportunities
to extend Russian sway internationally, expanding the Russian economy,
and protecting Russian culture and society from information interference
and psychological attacks]{.underline} (Gurganus and Rumer, 2019**[). To
achieve many of these goals, Putin believes that Russia must undermine
the standing of the US domestically, in Europe, and around the world, as
the Kremlin sees the US as pursuing policies to maintain American
hegemony and isolate Russia]{.underline}** (Wojnowski, 2021).

At its core, **[Russia seeks to use information to exert psychological
influence over individuals, societal groups, nations, and multilateral
institutions (Saradzhyan, 2021). Therefore, Russia's information warfare
targets U.S.democracy to create internal divisions, increase political
polarization, influence elections, and discredit democratic
institutions, as well as strain relations between the US and its
allies/partners through misinformation campaigns within and outside the
US that exacerbate tensions and undermine coalitions]{.underline}**
(Wojnowski, 2021).

Essentially, [Russia's goal in the US is to create so much polarization
and division that Americans come to doubt the legitimacy of democracy
and their government**. Internationally, Russia hopes to weaken Western
coalitions by promoting information that makes allies and partners
question each other.**]{.underline}

Solvency -- Cohesion

**Diverse threats against NATO poise an opportunity to bring the
alliance to harmony**

States Representative, and Simon, Staffordshire University Defense

There are also several specific threats and challenges that the 2022
Strategic Concept should address. [First, allies should tackle the
effects of emerging and emerged disruptive technologies on strategic,
defense, and force planning. Second, adversaries are increasingly using
high- and low-tech approaches short of armed conflict to disrupt
national politics and daily life in Western democracies. Enhancing and
coordinating resilience across the alliance should be a goal of the
strategic concept.]{.underline} Third, money remains the sinew of war.
Whether it is investment in national and common-funded capabilities, or
transfers to partners like Ukraine, ample and efficient spending is a
requirement for a successful strategy. Fourth, NATO should continue to
grapple with the distinct but related challenges of terrorism and
irregular warfare.

While it seems clear that Russian aggression has mitigated some
centrifugal tendencies in the alliance, NATO will remain more like an
orchestra requiring a conductor to avoid strategic cacophony, rather
than a self-organizing jazz band. [The strategic concept represents an
opportunity to better bring the members of the alliance into harmony. To
do so, it should address the dual challenge posed by Russia and China,
while better balancing NATO's core commitments with a diverse set of new
and growing threats.]{.underline}

#### Solvency -- NATO can solve impacts of disinformation by modeling existing infrastructure

**Smalley, Journalist Northwestern University MA Journalism, 22 **

(Suzanne, Northwestern University MA Journalism, 6-29-2022, CyberScoop,
\"NATO to create cyber rapid response force, increase cyber defense aid
to
Ukraine\", https://www.cyberscoop.com/nato-madrid-summit-cyber-ukraine/, accessed
on 7-6-2022, SR)

[NATO announced plans Wednesday for a commitment to create a rapid
response cyber force and to bolster military partnerships with civil
society and industry to respond to cyber threats.]{.underline}

Coming on the heels of a meeting that included leaders from all 30
allied countries, the Madrid summit declaration also said NATO will do
more to support Ukraine's cyber resilience and defense against Russia
while also focusing on China as a long-term and mounting cyberthreat.

["We are confronted by cyber, space, and hybrid and other asymmetric
threats, and by the malicious use of emerging and disruptive
technologies,"]{.underline} the declaration said. "We face systemic
competition from those, including the People's Republic of China, who
challenge our interests, security, and values and seek to undermine the
rules-based international order."

[The declaration's mention of more military collaboration with industry
is critical,]{.underline} said Jim Lewis, who directs the Strategic
Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.

"Paragraph 10 is the key, since it announces more civil-military
cooperation and a rapid reaction force -- these were the crucial
elements of Ukraine's successful cyber defense," said Lewis, who was
previously rapporteur and senior adviser for four U.N. Groups of
Governmental Experts on Information Security.

Cooperation is a regular theme of the document.

"We will significantly strengthen our cyber defenses through enhanced
civil-military cooperation," the declaration says. "We will also expand
partnership with industry. [Allies have decided, on a voluntary basis
and using national assets, to build and exercise a virtual rapid
response cyber capability to respond to significant malicious cyber
activities."]{.underline}

The declaration is a departure from past iterations which have tended to
rely on "routine 'we are concerned about cyber' add on statements"
instead of the substantive focus in the declaration released Wednesday,
said Mark Montgomery, senior director of the Center on Cyber and
Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and
the former executive director of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.

["Cyber is now part and parcel of both the threat and the response that
NATO looking at --- it's no longer some foreign object]{.underline}. It
is something that they have been building steadily since \[the\] Lisbon
\[NATO summit\] many years ago, and it's become more and more prominent
as time goes on. And that's appropriate."

However, [the information war has more than just a Western front. While
the West dismisses Russian narratives, other influential actors are
listening and embracing them. Russia's narrative is carrying sway in the
developing world and in China -- and some of its disinformation is being
parroted by conspiracy theorists within the U.S. Russia's war
disinformation will have consequences for international relations long
after the war. The West must act to counter it.]{.underline}

The Global South has been reluctant to condemn Russia for the war and to
counter its disinformation. Forty countries did not support the UN
General Assembly's extraordinary resolution condemning the Russia
invasion of Ukraine. Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria chose to
stand with Russia. The 35 abstentions unsurprisingly included China and
Iran, but also included India, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, South Africa, South
Sudan, and Vietnam---states which the U.S. has supported or had
partnerships, or warmed relations with in recent years. [The U.S. has
been dismayed by many African states' refusal to condemn the conflict,
causing a strain in their relationships. A total of 17 African nations
abstained on the UN General Assembly vote, and eight were
absent.]{.underline} Of the 28 African states that supported the
resolution, none elaborated on their position, with the notable
exception of an impassioned anti-colonialist speech by the Kenyan
ambassador. [South Africa's President, Cyrial Ramaphosa, has continued
to parrot the Russian official position that it perceived a "national
existential threat" from NATO and has criticized NATO's rumored
expansion into Ukraine. Correspondingly, a social media analysis
conducted in mid-March by the firm CASM Technology has found that
pro-Russian narratives are trending in language groups found in much of
South Asia, South Africa, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Iran. Putin appears to
be targeting these countries with his message to gain influence there.
Based on their leaders' positions, it appears to be
working.]{.underline}

China, which more tightly controls its Internet than any other country
in the world, has relentlessly promoted Moscow's narrative. While China
may be officially ambiguous about its support for Putin's war, its
state-controlled media lays its position bare. [China and Russia
resolved to strengthen their cooperation in media in 2015, and the war
has shown the success of this initiative.]{.underline} Within hours of
the invasion on February 24, the Chinese Communist Party's Global Times
posted a video saying that a large number of Ukrainian soldiers had
surrendered, citing the Russian state-controlled media network RT.
[China's state Central Television Station (CCTV) then promptly reported
and spread on social media that Zelenskyy had fled Kyiv. Chinese media
has repeated Russia's positions that the war opposes the West, NATO
expansion, Nazisim, and fascism, and is therefore
justified.]{.underline} [Meanwhile, it has reported that Ukraine is
using civilians as human shields and torturing captured
soldiers]{.underline}. Perhaps **[most dangerously for the U.S., Chinese
government officials has spread Russia's claims that the Pentagon was
financing biological weapons in Ukraine]{.underline}**. Chinese
government officials repeated the conspiracy theory at news conferences,
in the press, and on official social media accounts---in Chinese, Arabic
and English. The White House called out both countries for their
coordinated disinformation campaign and expressed concern that they
might be providing cover for a Russian biological or chemical weapons
attack. [Conspiracy theorists within the U.S. have picked up on the lab
disinformation and begun to spin it for their own propaganda campaigns,
including Fox News host Tucker Carlson and QAnon followers. Journalist
and national security critic Glenn Greenwald has opined that the theory
might be true.]{.underline}

Ukraine has achieved important strategic and military objectives through
its information campaigns, and has rightly convinced most of the world
of the morality of its cause. However, is has lost some important
information battles. Russia has won important information battles in
China, India, and most of Africa. And since **[the information war will
go on long after the shooting stops, Russia's victories have
ramifications for international relations going forward]{.underline}**.
[States who continue to buy into the Russian narrative may continue to
have strained relationships with the U.S. and the West. As the U.S. and
its NATO allies strive to develop stronger relationships with
resource-rich African states---in no small part so they can reduce
resource dependence on Russia and China, they may find that they are not
trusted as political and business partner]{.underline}s. The Russian
narrative may also harm the U.S.'s long quest for greater security
cooperation with India.

There are differences between the Western and Russian attitudes to
warfare in cyberspace. The Russian interpretation of cyber warfare ---
as it is called in the West --- is a kind of warfare that is part of the
so-called information confrontation. [3]{.underline} **[This has to be
observed through the lens of a geopolitical zero-sum game, in which the
national interest is achieved or protected with the involvement of
information infrastructures.]{.underline}** Cybersecurity as a term does
not appear in Russian usage. Documents from the Ministry of Defense and
other authorities refer to it as information security instead. [**This
encompasses more than cybersecurity: it is not solely about "the
protection of critical digital networks, but society's cognitive
integrity as well.**"4 **This points out that maintaining narratives
about certain events among populations is considered crucial by Russia.
By using operations that focus on the cognitive spheres, Russian actors
are able to spread disinformation and misinformation. As the narratives
become entrenched in the population, Russia is able to use them as
justification for their foreign policy and claim their strategic aims
are legitimate**.]{.underline}

Despite Africa's tremendous economic potential, the **[U.S. has lost

especially China. Indeed, while recent trends indicate that the **[U.S.

its relationship with the region to other powers]{.underline}**.

Importantly, the U.S. can build on new regional momentum to revive and
strengthen its partnership with Africa for mutual prosperity, including
building on the recent launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area
(AfCFTA), and given the promise of the initiatives of the DFC, Prosper
Africa, and the post-AGOA 2025 options. To do so means a shift in
emphasis in the relationship to one more focused on value-based foreign
policy,\[1\] and also building upon the areas of strength and
convergence with African citizens' preferences;\[2\] such as trade,
investment, technology, education, accountability, and a market-based
model of development

**[Trade and investment are not just about money and prosperity. They
also bring and support peace, stability, and security]{.underline}**. In
my book Unlocking Africa's Business Potential,\[3\] I explore key trade

U.S. trade and investment]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[Africa has
tremendous economic potential and offers rewarding opportunities for
local and global partners looking for new markets and long-term
investments with some of the highest returns, but also the potential to
foster economic growth, diversification, job creation]{.underline}**,
including for women and youth, and improved general welfare.

**[The fast population growth on the continent could be turned into
demographic dividends, or threats to global prosperity and
stability]{.underline}**. Africa was home to 17 percent of the world
population in 2020, and is expected to have 26 percent of the global
population in 2050 (2.53 billion people).\[5\] **[If Africa is not
successfully integrated into the global economy, there could be a major
threat to global prosperity and stability. Citizens could be further
subject to extreme poverty, fragility, violent extremism, illegal
immigration, health challenges, among others]{.underline}**---challenges
that many already face on the continent. **[If our goal is a prosperous
and safe world, Africa must not be left behind.]{.underline}**

**[The growth of household consumption and business spending: a unique
opportunity for U.S. trade and investment. By 2050, Africa will be home
to an estimated USD 16.12 trillion of combined consumer and business
spending.\[]{.underline}**6\]\[7\] **[And Africa's prosperity can be
good for the U.S.: Such growth will offer tremendous opportunities for
U.S. businesses in household consumption (USD 8 trillion) in areas such
as food and beverages, housing, hospitality and recreation, health care,
financial services, education and transport, and consumer goods, but
also business to business spending]{.underline}** (construction,
utility, and transportation, agriculture and agri-processing, wholesale
and retail, etc.).

4\. **[The rise of global partnerships and the competition between
traditional and new players: an opportunity for the U.S. to build on its
sustainable competitive advantage]{.underline}**. In 2009, China became
the region's prime trading partner. In fact, between 2006 and 2016,
**[China's trade with Africa surged, with imports increasing by 233
percent and exports increasing 53 percent]{.underline}**, **[as they did
for several other global players as well.\[8\] During the same period,
the U.S. lost ground in exports to Africa (-66
percent).\[9\]]{.underline}**

**[China's influence goes beyond the trade relationship: It is also the
top investor in infrastructure, and now is the first destination of
English-speaking African students,]{.underline}** **[outperforming the
U.S. and the U.K]{.underline}** But the U.S. remains a critical player
on the continent, as I mentioned in a recent article: "Successes in the
past decades---initiatives such as the African Growth and Opportunity
Act (AGOA), the President's Malaria Initiative, the President's
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Millennium Challenge Corporation,
and U.S. trade and investment hubs---have generated tremendous
opportunities for millions of Africans and Americans. But the current
era---and competition from other global powers---will require new ideas
and a new approach to several key issues."\[12\] In fact, African
countries would often prefer to work with the U.S. given local content
regulation rules, more investment in on-the-ground resources, and
standards about hiring/training locals. In other words, the U.S. is less
extractive and more transparent than numerous other partners.

5\. **[Fast urbanization but also fast rural population
growth]{.underline}**: **[By 2030, Africa will be home to 5 cities of
more than 10 million inhabitants and 12 other cities of more than 5
million inhabitants.\[13\] Cities in Africa are becoming powerful
economic centers, and a city-based approach to foreign policy, but also
trade and investment, will be critical to outperform competitors and
build mutual prosperity.]{.underline}** **[Contributing to the
prosperity of African cities will also make a difference in addressing
security challenges.]{.underline}**

6\. **[Africa has made tremendous progress in mobilizing resources for
infrastructure development, working hard to bridge gaps in ICT, energy,
water and sanitation, and transportation]{.underline}**. Despite the
remaining deficits, the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA)
reported that between 2013 and 2017 the annual funding for
infrastructure development in the region was USD 77 billion, about twice
as much as the annual funding average of the first six years of the
2000s.\[14\] However, many of these gaps persist. In 2018 the African
Development Bank (AfDB) found that Africa's infrastructure requirements
are between USD 130 and 170 billion a year, leaving a financing gap of
USD 68 to108 billion.\[15\] China has played a key role in financing,
and has become the largest bilateral infrastructure financer in Africa
(Chinese FDI grew 40 percent annually from 2010 to 2020).\[16**[\]
However, the U.S. has the chance to make a monumental difference when it
comes to investing in infrastructure development in
Africa.]{.underline}**

In fact, **[Africa has one of the fastest-growing, and is the
second-largest, mobile phone market in the world.\[17\]\[18\] In
sub-Saharan Africa alone, there were 477 million mobile subscribers in
2019; by 2025, the region will host 614 million cell phone subscribers,
and 475 million mobile internet users]{.underline}**.\[19\] The internet
is also expected to contribute to at least 5 to 6 percent of Africa's
total GDP by 2025.\[20\] While the Information and Communication
Technology sector is making incredible advancements, water and
sanitation, transportation, and energy infrastructure development still
needs significant investment. However, this is indicative of positive
and extensive investment opportunities that can be undertaken on the
African continent.

7\. **[Fast digitalization, increased technological innovation, and an
accelerated Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR): The Fourth Industrial
Revolution is characterized by the fusion of the digital, biological,
and technological world, and technologies such as artificial
intelligence, big data, 5G, drones and automated vehicles, and cloud
computing]{.underline}**.\[21\] **[As a world leader in technological
innovation, digital transformation, and the Fourth Industrial
Revolution, the United States is well-positioned to play a leading role
in the African digital space and contribute to Africa's pursuit of
now-vital technologies.]{.underline}**

Indeed, **[advanced technology can have beneficial spillover
effects:]{.underline}** For example, i**[n health, countries such as
Rwanda and Ghana are using an American drone company Zipline to deliver,
in record time, medication, blood, and medical supplies to remote rural
areas with limited road accessibility.\[22\] In agriculture, African
farmers now have access to affordable precision farming tools that use
sensors, satellites, smart devices, and big data technologies to inform
every decision.]{.underline}** The lending, insurance, and e-commerce
opportunities provided by the fintech industry are transforming the
lives of all Africans, and not just those in urban centers. These
advancements are just the beginning too, as African entrepreneurs are
increasingly seeking partners to bring transformative businesses to
life. African tech startup funding increased over 40 percent in 2020 to
over USD 700 million, a fraction of tech startup funding outside of
Africa. **[Despite such progress, the digital divide remains important
and must be bridged to allow inclusive development. During the pandemic,
for example, access to school and business on the continent was more
complex given the level of internet connectivity, among other
limitations.]{.underline}** **[Bridging the digital divide represents an
opportunity to both advance U.S. trade and investment in Africa while
addressing some of Africa's key priorities]{.underline}**.

8\. Fast regional integration and the African Continental Free Trade
Areas: opportunities for a continental engagement. With the signing of
the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in 2018, ratification
in 2019, and an official launch in January 2021, **[African growth
prospects and business opportunities have been magnified. The continent
is giving the world just one more reason to invest in it with the
creation of the largest new free-trade zone per number of countries in
world]{.underline}**, since the creation of the WTO. The AfCFTA will
**[accelerate Africa's industrialization as well as incomes, which will
lead to the increase of both household consumption and business
spending, generating unique opportunities for U.S. trade and
investment.]{.underline}** Per a World Bank study, the AfCFTA has the
potential to lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty, **[increase
the income of 68 million Africans, increase Africa's exports by USD 560
billion, and generate USD 450 billion of potential gains for African
economies by 2035.\[23\]]{.underline}**

9\. **[The sustained demand for accountability, democracy, and stability
of African citizens, and policy priorities aligned with U.S. core
valu]{.underline}**es. Per Afrobarometer surveys, 7 **[out of 10
Africans support democracy and accountable governance, and approximately
two-thirds are opposed to a single party or military
government.\[]{.underline}**24\] Importantly, **[areas in which the U.S.
has a sustained competitive advantage, given its global leadership in
democracy and human rights, and its support for such issues as health
and education, are priorities for Africans too]{.underline}**.\[25\]
Given China's leadership in infrastructure, **[the U.S. could grow its
footprint in this area but by partnering with other players such as the
G7 and the European Union countries.]{.underline}** This approach will
be welcomed by African citizens, who prefer the U.S. model of
development (32 percent) over the Chinse one (23 percent).\[26\]

### Internal Link -- Russian Disinfo Globalized

#### Russian disinfo has multiple audiences -- even if debunked in some places, it may still be confusing others

**[Every day we wake up to new Russian atrocities---and new Russian lies
about those atrocities---in Ukraine.]{.underline}** The latest example
is in Bucha, a Kyiv suburb where retreating **[Russian forces "left
behind dead civilians lining the streets---some with their hands bound,
some with gunshot wounds to the head." The Kremlin quickly issued
denials and claimed the evidence was fabricated]{.underline}**.

After weeks of war, **[much has been written about the success and
failures of Russia's disinformation and propaganda. These tactics, of
course, are not new.]{.underline}** Russia has been running propaganda
campaigns since the Cold War. **[What does feel new is the preponderance
of true information available---and perhaps equally importantly, the
speed at which it spreads]{.underline}**. **[Social media, satellite
imagery, and 24/7 reporting are directly refuting Russian disinformation
in real time]{.underline}**.

**[That news is only reaching some people, however]{.underline}**.
**[It's worth stepping back to consider the various audiences for
Russia's disinformation campaigns and examine where they're working and
where they're not.]{.underline}**

First, where it's not: Ukraine and the West. **[Russia and Putin have
spread a long line of falsehoods about Ukraine. They claimed that
Russian language speakers in Ukraine would welcome a Russian
invasion.]{.underline}** They've denied Ukrainian statehood, claiming
Ukraine has always been part of Russia. **[They said this "special
military operation" was necessary to "liberate" Ukrainians from their
"Nazi leaders]{.underline}**." And with the war underway, **[government
officials now claim Ukrainians, not the Russians, are shooting and
bombing their own people.]{.underline}**

**[None of this is true, of course. These falsehoods fell apart
immediately, both in Ukraine and in the West, largely because true
information won out]{.underline}**. **[The Biden administration released
intelligence that was remarkably accurate in predicting Putin's next
moves]{.underline}**. Social media users in Ukraine have posted videos
documenting the brutal invasion from Russian forces**[. Journalists have
used that evidence, along with satellite imagery and other tools, to
debunk false claims. As a result, foreign audiences can not only see for
themselves what's really happening in Ukraine, but also read the
heart-wrenching stories of citizens caught in the crossfire and fleeing
for their lives]{.underline}**.

**[That leads us to where the disinformation campaigns may be working,
at least for now: Russia, China, and the world beyond NATO, the EU, and
their allies.]{.underline}**

As with Soviet-era propaganda campaigns, **[Putin is trying to seal off
his population from information to control the narrative. Authorities
have shut down independent media and blocked most Western social
media]{.underline}**. For many**[, the only viable option left is
state-controlled media, which pushes Putin's false
narratives.]{.underline}**

**[Reports indicate this is working---at least to some extent. We read
stories of Ukrainians with family members in Russia who don't believe
the war is real]{.underline}**. "**[Every day I send them the necessary
information, but the response is that 'This is some kind of fake
information, that this cannot be the case at all, that no one can or
will shoot at civilians,'"]{.underline}** **[said one Ukrainian woman,
speaking about her sister and cousins who don't believe what's
happening.]{.underline}**

Likewise, **[a recent poll found Russians' support for Putin has
actually increased from 71 to 83 percent since the war started, although
the more repressive a regime, the harder it can be to know what people
are truly thinking.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[a recent study using a
more sophisticated methodology designed to elicit opinions on sensitive
topics found actual support for the war to be 15 percentage points---53
percent vs. 68 percent---lower than reported using traditional survey
methods]{.underline}**. On the one hand, it is interesting that even in
the current climate close to one-third of Russians were willing to
explicitly tell pollsters that they oppose the war. **[On the other,
even with the more sophisticated methods, more than half of Russians
still expressed support for the war, so the fact that many Russians
genuinely support the war should not be discounted -- the phenomenon of
"rallying round the flag" in times of war is a real one]{.underline}**.
**[Either way, true information will be critical to topple this digital
iron curtain and pressure Vladimir Putin to end the war]{.underline}**.

**[We also see evidence of Russia's disinformation narratives spreading
outside of Europe and the Western world. One recent New York Times
story, for example, revealed how China's Communist Party is using
university classes, the media, and videos to push "a campaign that
paints Russia as a long-suffering victim rather than an aggressor and
defends China's strong ties with Moscow as vital]{.underline}**."
Another piece in the New York Times reports on research showing how
**[Chinese state media is directly parroting Russian propaganda talking
points. Beyond China, one study discovered a coordinated network of new,
fake, and hacked Twitter accounts in Africa and Asia sharing pro-Putin
messages.]{.underline}** **[Another study found more than 170 websites
in various languages pushing war disinformation, and NBC recently
reported on Russian disinformation in Latin American media. The extent
to which these messages will resonate outside of the NATO countries and
their allies that are directly supporting Ukraine remains to be seen,
but recent votes at the United Nations show that governments in the
Global South remain much more conflicted about withdrawing support for
Russia, suggesting such campaigns remain important.]{.underline}**

#### Information space is exploited by Russia to continue to spread disinformation

**Hakala, NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence researcher
and Melnychuk, Canadian Department of National Defence Communications
Officer, 21** 

\[Janne & Jazlyn, 6-15-21, NATO Strategic Communications Centre of
Excellence, \"RUSSIA'S STRATEGY IN CYBERSPACE\",
<https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/Nato-Cyber-Report_15-06-2021.pdf>,
p. 5-7, accessed on 7-2-22, MG\]

[Russia's conceptualization of 'information confrontation' and the role
of cyberspace within it is outlined in strategic policy
documents]{.underline}, such as National Security Strategy (2015),
Foreign Policy Concept (2016), Information Security Doctrine (2016),
Military doctrine (2014), Conceptual Views on the Activity of the Armed
Forces in the Information Space (2016), as well as works and
publications by Russian military thinkers.

**[From the Russian perspective, cyber warfare or the Russian equivalent
'informationtechnological warfare,']{.underline}**1 [**is only a part of
the overarching concept of "information confrontation"**]{.underline}
(informatsionnoe protivoborstvo). [**The Russian Ministry of Defence
describes the information confrontation as the clash of national
interests and ideas, where superiority is sought by targeting the
adversary's information infrastructure while protecting its own objects
from similar influence**.]{.underline}2 The translation of the term
informatsionnoe protivoborstvo into English has proven difficult, and
has often incorrectly been translated as 'information warfare'3
('informacionnaja vojna'), despite the fact that protivoborstvo refers
to 'counterstruggle', 'countermeasure' or 'counteraction' rather than
'warfare'.4 This paper uses the term 'information confrontation' due to
its established status in discussions regarding hostile Russian
informational activities[.]{.underline}

[**The confrontation includes a significant psychological remit, whereby
an actor attempts to affect informational resources (documents in
information systems) as well as the minds of the adversary's military
personnel and population at large**.5 **Ultimately, cyber operations (or
informationtechnical means) are one of many methods used to gain
superiority in the information confrontation. Russia, and particularly
Russian President Putin's regime, sees the information confrontation as
a constant geopolitical zero-sum competition between great powers,
political and economic systems, and civilizations**.]{.underline}6

Protecting 'Information': Cognitive and Technical Publicly available
Russian doctrines and policy documents do not explicitly reference cyber
operations. Furthermore, Russian documents do not use the term
'cybersecurity', but refer instead to 'information security.' This term
differs from the Western notion of 'information security' (or in short:
infosec) in that it encompasses not only the protection of critical
digital networks, but society's cognitive integrity as well.7 There are
several reasons why Russian military thinkers apply the term 'cyber'
when talking about Western threats and activities, but are reluctant to
link the term to Russia's own capabilities and actions. Some authors
argue that this deliberate choice is related to negative connotations
around Soviet-era 'cybernetics,' as well as the importance the term
'information security' holds for Russia's own domestic politics 8.

When discussing the operational environment, Russia uses the term
'information space' (informatsionnoe prostranstvo), or 'information
sphere' (informatsionnaya sfera), which again is more comprehensive than
the Western concept of 'cyberspace' or 'cyber domain.' The 2016 Russian
Doctrine of Information Security defines the information sphere as: "a
combination of information, informatization objects, information systems
and websites within the information and telecommunications network of
the Internet \[...\], communications networks, information technologies,
entities involved in generating and processing information, developing
and using the above technologies, and ensuring information security, as
well as a set of mechanisms regulating social relations in the sphere".9

The information space refers to activities to form, transform, and store
information, as well as 'influencing individual and public
consciousness, information infrastructure and information itself.'10

According to Ofer Fridman, Russia conceptualizes cyberspace as the
intersection between hardware, software, infrastructure, and content11.
In this framework, the information-technological layer includes
hardware, software and infrastructure, while the
informationpsychological layer includes hardware, software and content.'
Irrespective of the means used -- technological (for example, destroying
digital infrastructure) or psychological (manipulating a message on
social media) -- activities in cyberspace are understood in terms of
their effect in the information space.12 Importantly, Russia perceives
the information space in very geopolitical terms, with their domestic
information space representing a continuation of territorial state
borders, which they view as constantly being violated by foreign
intrusions.13

**[NATO doctrine understands cyberspace as an operational domain and
considers it as part of the information environment. This environment is
'\[...\] comprised of the information itself, the individuals,
organizations and systems that receive, process and convey the
information'. The information processed through this environment
provides the base for cognitive processes that affect individual
decision-making and subsequently, behaviour. Those processes happen in
three dimensions -- physical, virtual and cognitive -- and cyberspace
involves all three of them. In this respect, NATO's concept of the
information environment is not that different from Russia's
understanding of 'information space' and the role of cyberspace within
it. Similarly, the Russian concept of 'information
weapons']{.underline}** (practically absent in Western parlance)
includes more than just digital measures.14 Although [the Russian Armed
Forces vaguely defines them as "information technologies, means and
methods used for the purposes of waging information war," in practice
the concept covers a wide array of activities (often with an emphasis on
affecting the human mind); this includes the spreading of
disinformation, electronic warfare, the degradation of navigation
support, psychological pressure, and the destruction of adversary
computer capabilities.]{.underline}15

Contrary to the Western view of interstate conflict that is based on the
international legal order outlined in international treaty and customary
law (specifically the UN Charter and the Geneva Conventions) that makes
a clear distinction between war and peace, [**Russia's 'information
confrontation' is constant and ongoing. This view is exploited by Russia
to undertake activities beneath the threshold of armed conflict,
allowing it to remain unpredictable and pursue strategic objectives
short of causing kinetic conflict.**16]{.underline}

A [key goal of Western democracies is to maintain a free, stable and
open Internet, where fundamental rights and freedoms are ensured. In
this regard, 'information security' is perceived as the protection of
data and systems, but not imposing control over the attitudes and
beliefs that the users of those systems are expressing.]{.underline} [At
the same time, the principles of openness and freedom of speech upheld
in Western democracies might be exploited by information and
cyberattacks. **Russia seeks to exploit this openness to gain
'information superiority,' notwithstanding whether it is in a
conventional conflict with its opponents or not.**]{.underline}

### Internal Link -- Regional Instability

#### Russian disinformation leads to destabilization throughout neighboring states

violations of OSCE norms by the Putin regime, ranging from internal
human rights abuses to military intervention in neighboring states to

On Thursday, September 14, 2017, the U.S. Helsinki Commission held a
hearing on Russian disinformation in the OSCE region. Sen. Cory Gardner
(CO) presided over the hearing on behalf of Commission Chairman Sen.
Robert Wicker (MS). Witnesses included Mr. John F. Lansing, CEO and
Director of the Broadcasting Board of Governors; Ms. Molly McKew, CEO of
Fianna Strategies; and Ms. Melissa Hooper, Director of Human Rights and
Civil Society Programs at Human Rights First.

In his opening statement, **[Sen. Gardner described the serious threat
that Russian disinformation poses to the liberal international order,
and underscored "how it undermines the security and human rights of
people in the OSCE region]{.underline}**." Russia's goal, he said, is
"to sow fear, discord, and paralysis that undermines democratic
institutions and weakens critical Western alliances such as NATO and the
EU."

**[Ranking Member Sen. Ben Cardin (MD) highlighted the impact of Russian
disinformation campaigns in Ukraine in conjunction with the recent
invasions of Crimea and the Donbas.]{.underline}** **[He also noted the
extent of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election in
the United States, and observed that such disinformation campaigns take
advantage of our democratic institutions to advance Russia's strategic
agenda.]{.underline}**

**[Helsinki Commission Co-Chairman Rep. Chris Smith (NJ-04)
characterized Russia's disinformation efforts as a part of a strategy of
"hybrid war,"]{.underline}** **[and emphasized the need for the United

**[Two experts in counter-disinformation and defence reform will work
with the Bosnian Armed Forces and NATO to uphold peace and security in
the country]{.underline}**

**[UK will also provide funding to strengthen cyber security in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, making the country more resilient to
attacks]{.underline}**

**[Russia is stirring violence and secessionism in the country to
undermine the hard-won peace and destabilise the European
continent]{.underline}**

UK military specialists will be sent to Bosnia and Herzegovina to
reinforce the NATO Mission and promote stability and security in the
country, the Prime Minister has announced today (Thursday 30th June).

**[Bosnia and Herzegovina is currently facing the greatest existential
threat in its post-war period, with secessionist leaders actively
working to create further division and conflict. These plans are backed
by Moscow as part of Putin's drive to undermine both Bosnia's
Euro-Atlantic integration and its stability.]{.underline}**

**[At the request of NATO Headquarters Sarajevo, a UK military
counter-disinformation expert and a civilian strategic defence adviser
will be deployed to support and train the Bosnia and Herzegovinian Armed
Forces.]{.underline}**

**[The counter-disinformation expert will bolster the NATO HQ and Bosnia
and Herzegovina's ability to resist malign influences -- helping block
Russian and other efforts to sow mistrust and undermine democracy in the
country and region.]{.underline}**

**[The new strategic defence adviser will support defence reform in the
country, helping them to develop a modern, representative Armed Forces
brought up to NATO standard.]{.underline}**

In addition, the UK will provide £750,000 to establish a cyber-security
centre of excellent within the University of Sarajevo. This will bolster
Bosnia and Herzegovina's defences against cyber attacks -- which can
hurt people both within and beyond the country. The UK will work closely
with media outlets and Bosnian institutions to equip them with the tools
to identify and mitigate the effects of lies and disinformation.

The Ministry of Defence is currently working with its Bosnian
counterpart to keep the country rooted on a Euro-Atlantic trajectory,
developing the capability and resilience the Bosnian Armed Forces need
to tackle the security challenges they face.

The assistance recognises the UK's leadership in countering malign
influence and fostering security and stability. The UK has a
longstanding commitment to peace and security in the region, starting in
the 1990s when British soldiers formed an integral part of humanitarian
efforts during the Bosnian War. UK troops have continuously served it
the country ever since, helping it to rebuild and protecting and
promoting peace.

The Prime Minister said:

We cannot allow the Western Balkans to become another playground for
Putin's pernicious pursuits. By fanning the flames of secessionism and
sectarianism Russia seeks to reverse the gains of the last three decades
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, gains that have brought more stability to our
whole continent.

That is why we are stepping up support to Bosnia and Herzegovina,
answering the call from our friends to help protect the peace they so
rightfully deserve to enjoy.

In addition to military support to the Bosnian Armed Forces and NATO,
the UK is working politically to uphold the historic Dayton Peace
Accords. We have sanctioned those working to undermine rule of law in
the country and last year the Prime Minister appointed a new Special
Envoy to the Western Balkans to tackle serious and organised crime and
other joint security challenges.

#### Russian and Chinese propaganda undermine democracies that have previously sustained peace throughout Europe 

**Janda, Czechia Chamber of Disputes Member, 20**

7-2-2022, LASA-LR\]

Until recently, Russian and Chinese influence across Europe generally
reflected their distinct strategic aims. But their interests
increasingly converge**[. Common to both Vladimir Putin's and Xi
Jinping's strategies is the decoupling of the United States and
Europe.]{.underline}** **[Leaders on both sides of the Atlantic will
have to act in concert -- and fast -- to forestall an]{.underline}**
**[even greater corrosion of the democratic norms that have kept the
peace]{.underline}** -- or helped restore it, in the case of the wars in
the former Yugoslavia -- for three-quarters of a century.

**[Russia and China have made particular inroads in Central and
Southeastern Europe in recent years.]{.underline}** **[Putin's
government identifies dissatisfied segments of the public and the
political class and maliciously exploits vulnerabilities via
disinformation and related propaganda to exacerbate divisions, hinder
democratic institutions, and generally neutralize the European space,
particularly in the Balkans]{.underline}** and the "Visegrad Four"
countries of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Xi's
multiple and insidious charm offensives, on the other hand, have been
comparatively apolitical, being less concerned about democratic or
authoritarian governance and more aimed at bolstering the Chinese
Communist Party's global legitimacy, especially among political,
business, and intellectual elites.

**[Neither Moscow's nor Beijing's approaches and tactics are mutually
exclusive]{.underline}**. **[Russian state, military, and religious
leadership affirmatively engage aligned or sympathetic elites, while
China uses media proxies to steer public discourse in its favor on its
priority issues]{.underline}** --- Hong Kong's autonomy, Taiwan's de
facto independence, and the human rights of China's Uyghur and Tibetan
communities.

**[To the delight of both Russia and China, the gradual weakening of
U.S.-European ties over the last two decades is accelerating due to
mutual neglect, miscommunication, and diminished policy coordination in
a post-Cold War world]{.underline}**. It hasn't helped that the Trump
administration's approach to resolving inequities in NATO member
defense-spending commitments or aspects of transatlantic trade relations
has been nearly all vinegar and little wine. **[The result is rapidly
diminishing support for partnership with America in key ally states such
as Germany]{.underline}**. According to a Pew Research poll in April,
almost as many Germans prioritized their country's relationship with
China -- 36 percent -- as with the United States (37 percent). That was
a significant change from a year earlier, when 50 percent of Germans
preferred a closer partnership with the United States, compared with 24
percent favoring better ties with China.

**[Washington's unhelpful bellicosity understandably alienates many
Europeans, making it all the more difficult for their elected leaders to
work jointly even on common interests]{.underline}**. This reciprocal
disengagement between Washington and key European capitals leaves room,
in turn, for adversarial interventions by Russia and China.

Policy Recommendations

Update NATO's Strategic Concept to incorporate a forward-looking
approach to emerging security challenges including disinformation.

**[Disinformation changes shape, force-multiplies conventional
capabilities and presents a threat to NATO's foundational value system
on an indefinite timescale.]{.underline}** **[The challenge is
anticipating and managing disinformation rather than eliminating it
entirely, without overstating the threat]{.underline}**.64
**[Disinformation also mirrors adversary thinking and offers a window
into the goals and means of malign actors. NATO should develop a more
holistic understanding of security that encapsulates shifts in
information technologies and use of strategic narratives. NATO currently
responds ex post to discrete, finite disinformation campaigns at the
operational and strategic levels rather than preparing for the
inherently unpredictable nature of threats in the emerging security
environment. Recognizing that unconventional means could pose an
existential threat to the Alliance, NATO's updated Strategic Concept
should remove the distinction between conventional and unconventional
threats and emphasize that future threats will occur across the spectrum
of peace to war. In other words, the Alliance should unambiguously
recognize the security implications of non-military means. Effecting
such a shift in NATO's strategic thinking would improve overall
readiness moving forward.]{.underline}**

**[Develop a networked approach to security and
resilience.]{.underline}**

**[Collective security and the appropriateness of full-scale NATO
responses came under deliberation as cyber aggression became a prominent
tool of below-threshold warfare]{.underline}** (on cyber challenges, see
Blessing in this volume). **[Like cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns
can be launched from anywhere by state and non-state actors, have little
or no command structure, can be syndicated or promoted by
entrepreneurial patriots, operate in networks, and are difficult to
attribute. As the information sphere becomes the critical operational
domain for hybrid warfare]{.underline}**,83 **[the side that masters the
network will almost certainly gain an advantage]{.underline}**.84
**[Greater connectivity in NATO's Command, Control, Communications,
Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance]{.underline}**
(C4ISR) **[systems also makes them higher value targets for
disinformation, cyber, and physical attacks]{.underline}**.85 **[For the
first time in its history, the Alliance is facing challenges that
require partnership with a variety of (private and civil society) actors
to increase learning and situational awareness---including, most
importantly, an understanding of the role that disinformation plays
within an ensemble of influence tools and operations---but also
establish a support system that can be mobilized in response to emerging
security challenges]{.underline}**.86 **[This will enhance NATO's
anticipatory thinking and its ability to quickly react as crises
emerge.]{.underline}**

**[NATO should also use its political dialogue mechanisms to create a
coherent methodology across member nations. The Finnish and Swedish
total defense and civil preparedness concepts are good models to draw
upon at the national and multinational level]{.underline}**.87 **[This
could include the creation of institutional networks, society-oriented
activities, infrastructure building, research, education, and
training---tools that go beyond mere debunking and strategic
communications. The Swedish model of psychological defense also includes
crisis modelling drills for a variety of civil actors including media
outlets.]{.underline}**88

#### Comprehensive approach key to solving disinformation -- systemic engagement and cooperation key to preventing the worst impacts of disinformation

This final article on Russian information warfare presents [policy
recommendations that can be adopted to combat and respond to information
warfare.]{.underline} [Each case study exhibits unique circumstances
that illuminate potential policy options for counteracting Russian
disinformation campaigns]{.underline}. After analyzing both the
successes and failures in each case study, the **[following policy
recommendations emerged: transparency, preemptive information-sharing,
media literacy campaigns, private-sector engagement, and multilateral
cooperation. These policy recommendations provide a broad framework for
all countries facing a similar threat.]{.underline}**

1.  **[Transparency]{.underline}**

[**The first policy that all governments, institutions, and agencies
should adopt is transparency**. One of Russia's goals is to weaken
society by creating division and doubt about what is true and what is
false. This is particularly evident when you examine how Russia has used
information warfare to make average citizens question the legitimacy of
their own governments and the information that they receive from
them.]{.underline} [Although a vital part of democracy is the freedom to
question the information of a government**, Russia has exploited this to
foment division and make people doubt the very legitimacy of their own
governments** and whether they truly support the rule of
law]{.underline}

**[The best way to combat these efforts is by being transparent with the
public, providing factual evidence that backs up an official government
claim.]{.underline}** [The United States has attempted this strategy
through its intelligence community's bid to shine a light on Russian
disinformation campaigns in advance of the February 2022 invasion of
Ukraine, sometimes before the events had even happened]{.underline}.
[Although met with uncertainty at first]{.underline}, **[when many of
these events eventually transpired, this strategy proved itself
an effective tool for transparency.]{.underline}**

The European Union also seeks to be transparent with its populace by
tracking and exposing examples of Russian disinformation on its website
EUvsDisinfo, which currently has a database of over 13,000 cases. The EU
emphasizes the explanatory rather than inflammatory nature of
EuvsDisinfo, which is run by the body's East StratCom Task Force. The EU
values transparency and public awareness of disinformation above all
else, and the organization publicly states on its website that no
counter-information operations are conducted. **[Information warfare is
inherently based on lies, deception, and misdirection. For this reason,
policy intended to counter it should focus on being as transparent as
possible with the public in order to cut through the fog and build trust
among citizens.]{.underline}**

2.  **[Preemptive Information-Sharing]{.underline}**

[Another policy option that has thus far shown promising results in
combating Russian information warfare is the use of preemptive
information-sharing]{.underline}. **[This policy option calls upon
members of the government and intelligence community to preemptively
release information to the public once the intelligence agencies are
warned of a particular misinformation or disinformation campaign that
Russia is planning to implement]{.underline}**. [Preemptively warning
about an upcoming Russian information operation alerts both the general
public and foreign countries ahead of time, thus enabling them to
prepare for and weaken Russia's operation.]{.underline}

Currently, [this strategy is successfully being implemented by the US in
regard to Russia's invasion and the Kremlin's response to the global
sanctions. **Two key examples that demonstrate its overall success
include the US releasing intelligence that Russia was planning to use
a false flag operation to justify the invasion and President Biden's
warning to American corporations that Russia was going to disrupt the US
via a hacking campaign.**]{.underline} In both cases, **[the policy of
preemptive information-sharing informed the relevant parties and the
public of the Kremlin's antics, thus reducing the attack's likelihood of
success and giving actors time to steel themselves against
it.]{.underline}**

[**Other countries and multilateral organizations should employ this
policy, as it essentially beats Russia at its own game.** By releasing
reports that Russia intends to carry out a misinformation or
disinformation attack, it makes the public aware of the threat, thereby
making information warfare less effective because individuals in society
are less likely to fall victim to the false narrative and propaganda
slogans.]{.underline}

3.  **[Media Literacy Education]{.underline}**

[Campaigns to promote media literacy can be a potent force in
inoculating audiences against information warfare.]{.underline} **[If
given the proper intellectual tools, audiences can be taught to identify
misinformation, independently fact-check, and compile trustworthy
verified sources]{.underline}**.

[**Latvia, which has been on the front line of Russian information
warfare for years, has successfully used media literacy education at
schools and universities**. Similarly, since the annexation of Crimea
and invasion of the Donbass in 2014, Ukrainian civil society groups have
successfully implemented a number of programs aimed at improving media
literacy.]{.underline}

[Universities, schools, and other organizations can conduct short
courses or workshops for students, journalists, and political activists
to effectively recognize misinformation.]{.underline} [Civil society
groups and journalist organizations have also found success in exposing
and disproving Russian misinformation using verifiable
facts.]{.underline} **[Openly exposing misinformation narratives can
drown out and delegitimize information warfare campaigns, and can be
an effective alternative to censorship, which raises civil liberties
concerns.]{.underline}**

[As governments scramble to protect their populations from information
warfare, media literacy education campaigns---**starting from an early
age and conducted by balanced and trusted organizations---can have
a major impact**]{.underline}.

4.  **[Private-Sector Engagement]{.underline}**

**[Engagement with the private sector has shown itself to be a crucial
aspect of countering Russian information warfare]{.underline}**.
**[Since many covert disinformation campaigns are conducted via social
media, the corporations that run these websites and apps necessarily
have a role to play in coordinating responses to this
threat.]{.underline}** There are many schools of thought on how the
public and private sector should interact within this space, [with some
arguing that the public sector should simply dictate policy to
corporations and others advocating for allowing companies to
self-regulate their content]{.underline}.

The European Union has opted for something in between, called
[co-regulation, and this model serves as a useful example for how states
may approach policy to counter information warfare in a pragmatic way.
The coregulation model seeks to find areas of potential cooperation with
social media companies in a way that aims to foster goodwill and keep
them on the side of governments in the fight against
disinformation.]{.underline} The EU has attempted to implement this
through its Code of Practice, which serves as a guide for how private
companies should regulate disinformation in key areas such as political
advertising and general integrity of services.

The Code of Practice is far from perfect: critics have noted that the
progress companies make in tracking disinformation areas is largely
self-reported and is not subject to strict enforcement. However, **[it
provides a helpful framework for how states and international actors can
orient policy against disinformation in a way that includes the private
sector. Large social media companies must be considered in any attempt
to counter Russian information warfare due to how heavily the Kremlin
relies on these media to conduct its information
operations]{.underline}**. [Many of these companies have a vested
interest in regulating disinformation, but their concerns are primarily
financial and are not inherently opposed to the idea of
Russian-originated accounts stoking divisive topics on their platforms.
**Policies that bring the private sector into the fold as a collaborator
against disinformation, like the EU's Code of Practice, are preferable
to allowing corporations to be the sole arbiters of what should and
should not be allowed on their platforms**]{.underline}.

5.  **[Multilateral Cooperation]{.underline}**

[The scope of information warfare has evolved beyond the borders of one
country, with impacts spreading globally]{.underline}. Therefore, **[for
a country to effectively combat information warfare of any type,
a multilateral effort must be considered]{.underline}**. [This entails
countries coming together in creating effective solutions to combat
information warfare by implementing standards and structures through
shared experiences]{.underline}. **[Not only does multilateral
cooperation to combat information warfare strengthen efforts, but it
also holds countries accountable in their own domestic
processes.]{.underline}** Overall, **[countries should make multilateral
cooperation one of their key solutions to combating information
warfare]{.underline}**

**[In the case of Poland, binding obligations to multilateral security
measures within the EU and NATO have strengthened domestic information
security structures.]{.underline}** These include physical and legal
implementations that help combat impending threats and destruction
caused by Russian information warfare. **[A desire to measure up to the
legal standards of the EU and NATO has not only impelled the initiatives
taken by Poland in the security realm, but also inspired domestic
enterprise. In addition, as a member state of both organizations, Poland
has also contributed to their information security]{.underline}**.
Therefore, **[a multilateral approach to Russian information warfare
fosters greater accountability and ingenuity in combating the various
associated threats]{.underline}**

[**Multilateral cooperation in the face of information warfare will
resolve a variety of issues when it comes to combating this evolving
threat**. As globalization has spread, so too have the platforms and
techniques of information warfare evolved to impact a series of actors
ranging from online citizens to government institutions.]{.underline}
The case study of [Poland perfectly exemplifies why multilateral
cooperation would benefit countries as they attempt to counteract the
various derivative threats of information warfare. **An approach that
seeks multilateral cooperation would strengthen the legal and physical
structures of countries while implementing domestic
accountability**]{.underline}. Of course, [multilateral cooperation is
not a perfect solution, **but it offers a pre-established platform that
would provide the basis for further problem solving.**]{.underline}

**[Conclusion]{.underline}**

As demonstrated in this series of articles, Russian **[information
warfare poses a massive threat to the future of
democracy]{.underline}**. [The danger lies in the Kremlin's ability to
use various methods and tools that target each nation differently, thus
making a global response more difficult. That said, as laid out in the
previous sections, the successes and failures of democracies around the
world show which countermeasures work and, therefore, what policies
should be adopted to limit Putin's ability to further divide the
democratic world**. By adopting transparency, preemptive
information-sharing, media literacy campaigns, private-sector
engagement, and multilateral cooperation, countries can combat
information warfare while protecting vital civil liberties. Information
warfare is here to stay and will continue to evolve as social media and
the internet continue to change. Thus, states must develop strong
responses now and prepare for future threats.**]{.underline}

#### Disinformation is the most common and one of the most dangerous forms of hybrid threats---NATO coordination and proactive approach key to solve threat escalation 

**Center for European Policy Analysis, 21** 

\[7-28-2021, Center for European Policy Analysis, \"Hybrid Warfare of
the Future \",
<https://cepa.org/hybrid-warfare-of-the-future-sharpening-natos-competitive-edge/>,
accessed on 7-2-2022, MG\]

[Hybrid warfare combines military and nonmilitary as well as covert and
overt means, such as disinformation, cyberattacks, economic coercion,
lawfare, corruption, and irregular and regular forces. Hybrid methods
are used to blur the lines between war and peace.]{.underline} [They
attempt to undermine target institutions and populations to achieve
strategic aims]{.underline}. While these threats are not new,
[technological advancements and increasing global connectivity have
recently expanded their speed, intensity, and scope. To more effectively
tackle future hybrid threats from Russia, China, and non-state actors,
the transatlantic community and NATO should improve]{.underline} in the
following key areas.

[Raise public awareness of hybrid threats. To counter hybrid threats,
the transatlantic community must first understand what they
are.]{.underline} [Participants in the digital campaign considered
disinformation and cyberwarfare to be the most common and pressing
hybrid threats of today]{.underline}. On the other hand, there was less
awareness of economic coercion, political subversion, and lawfare.
Experts noted that while the existence of these threats is acknowledged
individually, their use in conjunction makes them increasingly
disruptive and their interconnectivity is underexplored. [There is an
urgent need to understand the impact of these threats on transatlantic
societies and institutions and which hybrid actions are most likely to
succeed or cause damage to allies in the future.]{.underline} [Future
hybrid threats that require more attention include weaponized
corruption, automated armies, and biowarfare. 80% of respondents to a
campaign poll believed NATO's 2021 Brussels Summit Communiqué adequately
prioritized hybrid threats.]{.underline}

[Increase NATO's speed of recognizing hybrid threats. Looking to the
future, participants agreed the Alliance must be able to more quickly
recognize and respond to hybrid campaigns before they can fully unfold
and achieve their aims. This requires investing more in intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities; leveraging open-source
information; and utilizing human-machine teaming]{.underline} [to
compete with adversaries that have more centralized, rapid
decision-making than NATO. These capabilities can aid in the attribution
of hybrid actions to their perpetrators, which are purposefully
difficult to detect. To help the Alliance better recognize,
conceptualize, and plan for hybrid threats, campaign participants
suggested NATO consider a sixth "cognitive" or "human" domain of future
warfare.]{.underline}

[Get comfortable operating more proactively below the threshold of
conflict.]{.underline} [Hybrid threats often fall below NATO's Article 5
threshold of armed attack laid out in its founding treaty.
This]{.underline} [makes it difficult for NATO member states to respond
swiftly and appropriately in collective defense.]{.underline} [NATO has
already acknowledged that a serious cyberattack can trigger Article 5.
But rather than waiting for today's ongoing cyberattacks to escalate to
that level, 93% of survey respondents agreed NATO must play a more
proactive role in addressing below-threshold hybrid
threats.]{.underline} [For example, NATO could help coordinate more
active and persistent cyber defense capabilities from nations, such as
"hunt forward" teams. Under Article 3 of its founding treaty, NATO can
also help nations mitigate the effects of hybrid threats by setting
resilience standards and capability targets.]{.underline}

Build trust between governments, institutions, and publics. Survey
respondents overwhelmingly agreed that national governments bear the
most responsibility for countering hybrid threats. But their trust in
officials and institutions to take such action varied greatly, with
nearly 50% of respondents rating their trust levels at three on a
five-point scale. This lack of confidence plays directly into the aims
of adversaries' hybrid campaigns, inhibits societal resilience, and
undermines government response. [NATO ally and partner publics should
engage in more civil education campaigns and trust-building exercises to
strengthen democracies against hybrid threats.]{.underline}

### Coordinated Solvency

#### Solvency -- Strong, coordinated democracies are key to deterring the spread of disinformation

LASA-LR\]

**[The intentional use of misleading information to influence societies,
or disinformation, presents a serious threat to the integrity of
democratic systems]{.underline}**. Authoritarian states regularly use it
to exploit democracies' open information systems, presenting a
significant national security threat that demands a purposeful and
concerted response. This paper is the third in a series of papers that
deals with how democracies can build resilience against disinformation.
The first installment, Democratic Defense Against Disinformation,1 and
its follow-up, Democratic Defense Against Disinformation 2.0,2 unpacked
the challenge of foreign-origin disinformation and suggested practical
steps to deal with it, including actions by governments, social media
companies, and civil society. The core argument was that defense against
disinformation has to be rooted in democratic principles and values:
transparency, accountability, and respect for freedom of expression. We
must not become them to fight them.

**[While domestic-origin disinformation is a more widespread (and
growing) challenge, the tools to deal with foreign state-sponsored
disinformation are broader]{.underline}**. The Russian government was
the first mover and innovator in exploiting the digital information
environment to carry out influence operations against democracies,
targeting the United States, Europe, and countries beyond.3

**[But while Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections awoke
Americans and Europeans to the threat of disinformation, the response
has not deterred the Kremlin, which has extended its efforts
globally]{.underline}**. Moreover, Russia is no longer the sole threat
in the foreign influence game. The **[Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has
far greater resources than Russia and a long track record of information
manipulation and aggressive intervention]{.underline}** in Taiwan and
Hong Kong. With the Covid-19 pandemic, China entered the global
disinformation space, targeting Europe, NATO, and the United States,
working from the Kremlin's playbook. There is now growing evidence that
Russia and China are working together to amplify anti-democratic
narratives.4

**[Democracies have aimed to identify, expose, and build greater public
awareness of state-sponsored disinformation with the goal of building up
greater long-term resilience to information influence
operations]{.underline}**.5 But the adversaries adapt and evolve their
strategies and tactics to circumvent exposure and attribution.
Companies, researchers, and governments are playing whack-a-mole ---
responding to each disinformation campaign as it arises while trying
(and failing) to keep up with new threats. **[To get ahead of foreign
disinformation, democracies must develop a proactive strategy to prevent
state-sponsored information operations in the first place.6 That means
getting off our back foot and getting on the offensive]{.underline}**.
This paper, written principally for the United States but hopefully
applicable in adapted form to other countries, is a road map for how
countries can get ahead of foreign disinformation. The new U.S.
administration should lead the democratic community in this effort.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**[The United States and other democratic countries have made progress
defending against foreign and domestic disinformation]{.underline}**.
**[Unevenly, but steadily, a structure for democratic defense against
disinformation is emerging, consistent with the principles of
transparency, accountability, and respect for freedom of
expression]{.underline}**. It includes:

a growing network of disinformation detectors (led by civil society
sometimes informed by government agencies);

social media companies (responsive to public and legislative pressure)
that constrict disinformation on their platforms;

an informed media that exposes disinformation; and,

potentially at a next stage, a regulatory framework that seeks to filter
out inauthentic and deceptive behavior.

**[While defensive measures cannot block all disinformation, they can
limit disinformation as more people learn to filter it out on their own
("social resilience").]{.underline}**

But defense is working against a moving target. Purveyors of
disinformation have grown more sophisticated and their tactics continue
to advance. The line between domestic and foreign disinformation has
blurred, with Russian agents using local actors as proxies to carry out
disinformation operations. "Deepfakes" are progressing beyond the
ability to detect such content in real time. China and other foreign
players (Iran, for example) have also entered the disinformation game.

**[Defensive tactics based on democratic values can mitigate the impact
of disinformation, but there remains a mismatch between the
fast-evolving threat and the slow implementation of efforts to manage
it.]{.underline}**

We, therefore, recommend supplementing defense with offense. Our
recommendations are designed for the United States; some may be
adaptable by European governments and the European Union (EU) as well.
**[Offense does not mean spreading disinformation (that would not be
consistent with democratic values and democracies aren't good at it
anyway). It does mean building up:]{.underline}**

**[Cyber tools to identify and disrupt foreign disinformation
operations]{.underline}**. **[The U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) has
already launched this option --- the U.S. military terms it "hunt,
surveil, expose and disable."]{.underline}** It has the appeal of
immediacy and directness, but at its harder-edged end it has drawbacks.
The "disable" option needs to be implemented with care.

**[Sanctions (and other financial) tools against disinformation
actors]{.underline}** and their sources of funding, and development of
contingent retaliatory sanctions as a deterrent. Use of the sanctions
tool requires persistence to apply well and its impact will be moderate
rather than decisive. It will be more effective if carried out in
parallel by the United States, the EU, and the United Kingdom.

**[Support for free media in the broad sense, including journalists,
activists, and independent investigators, can be the most effective tool
of counter-disinformation]{.underline}**. It is asymmetric --- it does
not directly counter disinformation --- but plays to the greatest
strengths of free societies dealing with authoritarian adversaries: the
inherent attraction, over the long run, of truth. This was a key lesson
of the Cold War, **[when 20th century methods, e.g., support for
independent radio broadcasting at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty
(RFE/RL), proved effective in reaching societies inside the Soviet Union
and Soviet Bloc.]{.underline}** Today, updated technologies, including
direct, although unofficial, support for activist journalists working
both inside and outside Russia (and China) may become a 21st century
equivalent. China's media and internet landscape is more restrictive
than Russia's but options exist there as well. These activities can be
slow to yield measurable results but can have strategic impact over
time, if applied with creativity and determination.

**[The United States and, to some degree, the EU, NATO, and some
European national governments, are already applying versions of these
tools]{.underline}**, but often haphazardly, without integrating them
into a policy framework and with only spotty coordination. **[For the
first two levels of tools, governments will have the lead; for the
third, civil society groups will be critical and, in some cases, leading
actors.]{.underline}**

**[The new U.S. administration under President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.
is likely to be more committed to developing a strategic response to
disinformation, and be more effective generally, in crafting and
implementing policies]{.underline}**. U.S. President Donald J. Trump's
mixed signals with respect to Russian disinformation, attacks on free
media, and distracting fights with European allies prevented a
coordinated response and set the United States back.7 Recovering from
these setbacks will not be easy, but the new Biden administration will
have a roadmap for what to do.

#### With increasing tech innovation and disinformation it is NATO's responsibility to invest in the protecting their democracies in the face of aggressive disinformation attacks

**[Strategic communications are a critical tool of deterrence and
defence]{.underline}**. Effective deterrence rests on clear projection
of the ability and resolve to act if necessary. For some adversaries and
challengers, information is now a domain of contest. The information
environment is contorted by misinformation, disinformation, and
deception from these actors. **[These techniques aim to disseminate
manipulated information with the intent of undermining trust in
democratic institutions]{.underline}**. **[Disinformation, propaganda,
and misinformation are especially dangerous in times of rapid
technological advancements]{.underline}** and when generational changes
continue to alter perceptions of NATO among Allied publics.

The rapid pace of digitisation across all walks of life poses a
particular challenge to NATO Strategic Communications. **[NATO and
Allied audiences are increasingly drawing their information from, and
are influenced by, information delivered via digital
means]{.underline}**. **[Strategic competitors continue to demonstrate
their growing capability and will to deploy the latest digital
technologies against NATO and Allies, particularly in the information
environment]{.underline}**. **[Building resilience across Allied
populations is the primary responsibility of Allies
themselves]{.underline}**. However, across the board, **[Allies have not
invested sufficiently in the human, technical, and financial resources
required to engage in a consistent and sustained manner on issues
related to security and defence]{.underline}**. Neither have they
prioritised proactive and consistent communications in support of
Alliance aims and objectives. Recognising the threat posed by state and
non-state actors who deploy aggressive tactics below the threshold of
conventional force to challenge and undermine Alliance values and
cohesion, **[NATO must ensure that it is aware and able to prevent and

### Resilience Solvency

#### Foregrounding disinformation and proactive threat management key to disinfo resilience

[This month in Madrid, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
will update its Strategic Concept, the principal document that guides
the alliance's political-military strategy and collective defense
operations.]{.underline} [The war in Ukraine has put resilience in the
face of Russian aggression front and center, especially in the cyber and
information operation domains. Over the years, NATO has digitized and
enhanced its security platforms, emphasizing]{.underline}
[interoperability of systems among its now 30 current member
states.]{.underline} **[If NATO is to become more resilient against
advanced persistent threats, hackers, and the maligned states that
sponsor them, then the 2022 Strategic Concept must infuse multinational
warfighting and deterrence against hybrid threats with methods that
facilitate access to data and information sharing on its platforms and
across multiple domains, namely in air, cyber, information, land,
maritime, and space operations.]{.underline}**

[The Strategic Concept is among NATO's most important documents as it
informs alliance planning, resource allocation, and programming based on
changes in the threat environment. But the document has not been updated
since 2010.]{.underline} [The 2010 Strategic Concept, entitled "Active
engagement, Modern Defense," contained just one brief sentence about
cyber attacks and did not even mention China.]{.underline} It also
stated that "Today, the Euro-Atlantic area is at peace," even though
Russia had invaded Georgia two years before and the threat of a return
to great power competition loomed.

To argue that a lot has happened between 2010 and 2022 would be an
understatement. Russia's annexation of Crimea and intervention in the
Donbas in 2014 and the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 shattered any
illusions of a lasting peace with Russia. China's territorial ambitions,
economic assertiveness, threats against Taiwan, and military
modernization threaten the rules-based order. Emerging technologies --
in the form of hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, quantum
computing, and machine learning -- have intensified great power
competition.

[The 2022 Strategic Concept should highlight the essential role of
technology in collective defense. To build greater digital capacity
while also emphasizing resilience, NATO must adopt a new technological
orientation on the military strategic level of command, especially
within the Allied Command Transformation (ACT) in Norfolk, Virginia and
the Allied Command Operations (ACO) in Mons, Belgium. **ACT leverages
advanced technologies for security and defense in capabilities,
procedures, public-private partnerships, civil-military relations, and
at NATO's Centers of Excellence. Led by the Supreme Allied Commander
Europe, ACO is responsible for collective defense through direction,
requirements, planning, and execution at the strategic
level.**]{.underline}

[However, the Strategic Concept 2022 should focus less on the emergence
of new technologies and more on how NATO's military and civilian
personnel use them. ACO and ACT must emphasize greater accessibility to
information and data for its multinational warfighters, cyber operators,
and civilian professionals. NATO must reach out to experts in the
private sector, academia, and non-governmental organizations to harness
ways to expand access and emphasize flexibility in multi-domain
operations. NATO can do this by providing more grants to private sector
partners and establish a new center of excellence on data and
information sharing.]{.underline}

[ACO and ACT should also enable personnel and partners to readily access
data and information in DIMEL domains: diplomatic, information/cyber,
military, economic, and legal. This would expand the range of measures
needed by ACT and ACO to connect and correlate deterrence with evolving
hybrid threats. To deter hybrid threats across multiple domains, with
enhanced access on different digital platforms, NATO members should
develop smarter and lethal capabilities to confront threats from state
and non-state actors. This would allow ACT and ACO to prepare for any
contingency and respond to adversaries in battlefields and
battlespaces.]{.underline}

[The 2022 Strategic Concept encourages collaboration in the
implementation of guidelines and procedures through a "plug-and-play"
concept, in which platforms and systems are optimized for readiness and
response at lightning speed. Plug-and-play is based on approaches used
in commercial software that allow for innovation and easy access to
networks and systems through secure platforms. The NATO School
Oberammergau should offer platform training and education courses
programs in mobile access for ACT and ACO personnel with appropriate
security clearances. This would allow them to access the appropriate
platform and utilize data and information necessary for their tasks and
responsibilities.]{.underline}

For example, NATO's Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) and Mine Action
(MA) Information Sharing Platform contains rich and publicly available
datasets on the roles played by the alliance in mitigating the illicit
trade in small arms, tanks, aircraft, and naval vessels. It reports and
updates NATO-funded projects to prevent adversaries from acquiring these
weapons. However, the SALW-MA platform is outdated and not user
friendly, impeding its functionality in practice.

Put simply, NATO's ACT and ACO should focus as much on easing access to
information as it does on advanced technologies and conventional
weaponry. This would provide NATO with useful tools to access data and
intelligence on the strategic, operational, and tactical levels and in
land, sea, air, space, and cyber domains using devices and platforms
that can seamlessly connect in different locations. But NATO Commands
cannot simply expect its existing personnel to adapt. They must be
trained and educated on a regular basis to use digital infrastructures
in ways that make their jobs easier.

[On the strategic level, the 2022 Strategic Concept must provide NATO's
political and military leaders with flexibility and resources to discern
the diversity of hybrid threats in the environment. NATO's strategic
planners, cyber operators, and warfighters should be trained and
educated in relevant digital platforms, access, and sharing data and
information in ways that improve collaborative decision-making and
collective defense. On the operations level, personnel must be given
enough space to share data and intelligence as well as to train tactical
level personnel on software that enables them to collect, analyze,
process, and disseminate information quickly and easily across multiple
domains.]{.underline}

Addressing these challenges is difficult for just one nation-state, let
alone for all 30 NATO members. Therefore, the 2022 Strategic Concept
should emphasize connectivity between member states in multi-domain
operations and in collaboration with the private sector and academia.
Accessibility to information and data sharing among NATO members should
be securitized and harmonized.

The challenge for NATO is not necessarily adopting and investing in
emerging and disrupting technologies for collective defense. Rather, the
question is whether ACT and ACO can enhance accessibility to digital
platforms and ease communications between platforms. Here, artificial
intelligence (AI) can play a role in overcoming critical obstacles.

[AI is now occupying a greater space in NATO's collective defense
orientation. The challenge in the 2022 Strategic Concept will be
delineating the degree to which AI will enhance the ability of the
alliance to analyze information and assess data. Moreover, AI is only as
good as the data it relies on. To maintain its technological edge, in
2021 NATO released an Artificial Intelligence Strategy, a good step
toward maximizing interoperability of weapons systems, improving
infrastructure, and building resilient hybrid defenses. While it
emphasizes collaboration with the private sector and academia, the
strategy needs further refinement as AI would help NATO's military and
civilian personnel interlink devices on different platforms, perform
rigorous data analytics, and quicken response time in response to a
conventional or hybrid attack.]{.underline}

[One innovation is the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North
Atlantic (DIANA). DIANA leverages partnerships among academics,
technology companies, start-up firms to address the full spectrum of
threats in the security environment. Private sector firms utilizing
DIANA can access innovation sites and test centers that focus on
artificial intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing, autonomous
machines, and biotechnology. In the past, alliance members supported the
creation and development of a venture capital Innovation Fund for
technology companies and start-ups. The Strategic Concept should support
the initiative with sustained public funds in ways that allow for
strategic-level planning at ACO and ATO to communicate more effectively
at the operational and tactical levels. DIANA and the Innovation Fund
are models for the alliance.]{.underline}

An existing partnership that is proving effective is NATO's
collaboration with Klarrio, a firm that provides the alliance with
innovative real-time data analytics and streaming services to combat
disinformation and fake news. Klarrio has partnered with NATO's
Strategic Communications Center (StratCom) to assist the alliance in the
information domain by streaming data analysis, processing, and
applications analytics to identify and eradicate disinformation for
NATO's strategic-level planners. It supports and updates dashboard
services to track suspicious activities in social media platforms,
maintains an interactive user interface, generates analytical reports,
and uses machine learning to analyze data and information.

The 2022 Strategic Concept must value partnerships and collaboration
with the private sector to develop solutions to pressing collective
defense challenges. Technology companies, academics, and start-ups can
work with NATO military and civilian personnel to push solutions to
multinational warfighters and cyber operators entrusted with protecting
alliance members from both conventional military threats and hybrid
attacks across multiple domains. This should not be difficult since the
world's most advanced capabilities, cutting-edge technology firms, and
experts are in NATO member states.

NATO still will need advanced stealth F-35s, aircraft carriers, and
tanks to wage war on the battlefield. However, NATO also needs digital
tools that enable its fighters to readily access information and data in
contemporary battlespaces. Whereas "battlefields" highlight land-based
operations over others, "battlespaces" are not concerned with a specific
arena. Access to data and information is a requirement for multi-domain
situational awareness.

[While it is difficult to predict how future geopolitical events will
play out, NATO almost certainly will continue to have to manage threats
from an aggressive and revisionist Russia, as well as a rising China.
NATO should leverage the Strategic Concept in ways that emphasize access
and flexibility against hybrid threats across multiple domains -- this
is contemporary resilience. Deterring hybrid attacks, whether in the
form of cyber intrusions, disinformation through social media platforms,
or maligned influence operations, demands that NATO protect its digital
infrastructure and allow for greater accessibility to information and
data necessary to operate in the gray zone of multi-domain spaces. A
"whole-of-alliance" approach grounded on multinational collaboration and
coordination, and centered on digital accessibility, will strengthen
NATO resilience.]{.underline} Artificial Intelligence, China,

[Propaganda, manipulation and misdirection have been long-standing
tactics of diplomacy and international competition.]{.underline} [In the
last decade,]{.underline} and especially around the 2016 US Presidential
election, 'fake news' and [disinformation became buzzwords of sorts that
led to a rediscovery of the role of information in political
competition.]{.underline} [The biggest difference between the
traditional and more recent debates on the matter is the digitalization
of information warfare and the subsequent scale, volume and speed
advantages brought by this digitalization. The advent of Information and
Communications Technologies (ICTs) brought about a faster information
exchange medium where traditional gatekeepers like editors, censors or
curators are of secondary importance and often irrelevant.]{.underline}
While in more traditional media forms, broadcast is dependent on the
approval of an intermediary individual or a group, with ICTs and social
media, this approval is often hard to enforce with the sheer scale of
information poured into such media venues. [Although automated content
moderation works in most cases, it can easily be
circumvented.]{.underline}^7^ [With information gatekeepers out of the
way, information becomes disintermediated]{.underline} (reduction in the
use of intermediaries), with information suppliers (citizen journalists
or anyone with access to social media) [directly able to reach
information consumers around the world, in real time.]{.underline}^8^
[The disintermediated nature of modern information exchange has rendered
ICTs a conducive ground for misinformation]{.underline} (unintended
spread of false information), **[disinformation]{.underline}**
(purposeful creation and dissemination of false information) and
malinformation (deliberate use of accurate or inaccurate information
with the purpose of harming an individual or people).^9^

### Democracy Solvency

#### Solvency - A full system approach solves for the suppression of dissenting opinions and marginalized voices.

[A systemic approach to deliberative democracy acknowledges that the
quality of political communication will vary greatly in different spaces
and at different times. Even the "unrestricted communication" of wild,
informal public spheres is valuable because this is where "collective
identities and need interpretations can be articulated with fewer
compulsions than is the case in procedurally regulated public
spheres"]{.underline} (Habermas 1996, 308). [Deliberative systems can
respond positively to non-deliberative activity, such as raucous
protests that prompt public attention to demands from marginalized
voices]{.underline} (Mansbridge et al. 2012, 19). However, [it is
possible for discourse in public spheres to be too wild, for
transmission mechanisms to amplify rather than reduce deception and
false claims, for failures of deliberation in empowered sites, and for
other problems that undermine the quality of deliberation throughout the
system.]{.underline} For instance, extremely "partisan and aggressive"
protests can generate "a toxic atmosphere for deliberation and thus is
not system enhancing over time" (Mansbridge et al. 2012, 20).

[It is therefore necessary to understand when forms of communication may
degrade a system.]{.underline} This topic has received relatively little
attention from deliberative theorists.2 [A systemic view suggests that
communication may harm the functions of a deliberative system even if it
is not obviously anti-deliberative at a micro level]{.underline}---that
is, "manifestly disrespectful, strategic, and coercive" (Rollo 2017,
592). [While intentional falsehoods and insults may be recognized as
anti-deliberative by participants or observers of a conversation, other
instances of anti-deliberative communication may only be detectable by
looking at their effects across forums, later in time, or
both.]{.underline}

### Deepfakes Solvency

#### Basic guardrails and ethics guidelines cooperation with services that provide deepfakes is key to limiting their malicious disinformation spreading capabilities 

**Fowler, Washington Post Technology columnist, 21**

\[Geoffrey A., 3-25-21, Washington Post, "Anyone with an iPhone can now
make deepfakes. We aren't ready for what happens next,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/25/deepfake-video-apps/,
accessed 7-1-2022, LASA-LR\]

Installing guardrails

**[Avatarify's creator, Ali Aliev, a former Samsung engineer in Moscow,
told me he's also concerned that deepfakes could be
misused]{.underline}**. But he doesn't believe his current app will
cause problems. "I think the technology is not that good at this point,"
he told me.

That doesn't put me at ease. "They will become that good," says Mutale
Nkonde, CEO of the nonprofit AI For the People and a fellow at Stanford
University. **[The way AI systems learn from being trained on new
images, she says, "it's not going to take very long for those deepfakes
to be really, really convincing."]{.underline}**

Your smartphone photos are totally fake --- and you love it

**[Avatarify's terms of service say it can't be used in hateful or
obscene ways, but it doesn't have any systems to check]{.underline}**.
Moreover, the app itself doesn't limit what you can make people say or
do. "We didn't limit it because we are looking for use cases --- and
they are mainly for fun," Aliev says. "If we are too preventive then we
could miss something."

Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California
at Berkeley, says he has heard that move-fast-and-break-things ethos
before from companies like Facebook. "**[If your technology is going to
lead to harm --- and it's reasonable to foresee that harm --- I think
you have to be held liable,]{.underline}**" he says.

What guardrails might mitigate harm? **[Wombo's CEO Ben-Zion Benkhin
says deepfake app makers should be "very careful" about giving people
the power to control what comes out of other people's
mouths.]{.underline}** His app is limited to deepfake animations from a
curated collection of music videos with head and lip movements recorded
by actors. "You're not able to pick something that's super offensive or
that could be misconstrued," Benkhin says.

MyHeritage won't let you add lip motion or voices to its videos at all
--- though it broke its own rule by using its tech to produce an
advertisement featuring a fake Abraham Lincoln.

There are also privacy concerns about sharing faces with an app, a
lesson we learned from 2019′s controversial FaceApp, a Russian service
that needed access to your photos to use AI to make faces look old.
Avatarify (also Russian) says it doesn't ever receive your photos
because it works entirely on the phone --- but Wombo and MyHeritage do
take your photos to process them in the cloud.

**[App stores that distribute this technology could be doing a lot more
to set standards. Apple removed Avatarify from its China App Store,
saying it violated unspecified Chinese law]{.underline}**. But the app
is available in the United States and elsewhere --- and Apple says it
doesn't have specific rules for deepfake apps aside from general
prohibitions on defamatory, discriminatory or mean-spirited content.

**[Labels or watermarks that make it clear when you're looking at a
deepfake could help, too]{.underline}**. All three of these services
include visible watermarks, though Avatarify removes them with a
\$2.50-per-week premium subscription.

**[Even better would be hidden watermarks in video files that might be
harder to remove, and could help identify fakes.]{.underline}** All
three creators say they think that's a good idea --- but need somebody
to develop the standards.

**[Social networks, too, will play a key role in making sure deepfakes
aren't used for ill]{.underline}**. Their policies generally treat
deepfakes like other content that misinforms or could lead to people
getting hurt: **[Facebook and Instagram's policy is to remove
"manipulated media," though it has an exception for
parodies]{.underline}**. TikTok's policy is to remove "digital
forgeries" that mislead and cause harm to the subject of the video or
society, such as inaccurate health information. YouTube's "deceptive
practices" policy prohibits technically manipulated content that
misleads and may pose a serious risk.

**[But it's not clear how good of a job the social networks can do
enforcing their policies when the volume of deepfakes
skyrockets]{.underline}**. What if, say, a student makes a mean joke
deepfake of his math teacher --- and then the principal doesn't
immediately understand it's a fake? All the companies say they'll
continue to evaluate their approaches.

One idea: **[Social networks could bolster guardrails by making a
practice out of automatically labeling deepfakes --- a use for those
hidden watermarks --- even if it's not immediately obvious they're
causing harm. Facebook and Google have been investing in technology to
identify them.]{.underline}**

"The burden here has to be on the companies and our government and our
regulators," Farid says.

### AT -- Disinfo Shifts

#### Shifts in disinformation landscape are inevitable and unpredictable -- nimble, proactive approach key to mitigating complex threats

malign actors (in particular, Russia) utilized many recycled
disinformation narratives combined with "traditional"
propaganda]{.underline}**.63 The emergence of new actors, in particular
China as well as Iran, their resources, and their ability to deploy
manipulative tactics seem to evolve faster than their actual
technological prowess.

**[As transatlantic democratic actors are exploring the future of
disinformation, the pace and scope of technological innovation will be
crucial]{.underline}**. But they will also have to grapple with more
traditional tools of malign influence. **[It is yet unclear to what
extent foreign authoritarian actors will have the ability to acquire and
deploy new technologies at scale, especially as their media and digital
deception machinery already seem successful. A key question is also
whether deploying such technologies fits into the geopolitical
strategies of malign actors and their approach to global competition.
China in particular is an important actor that requires further
monitoring.]{.underline}** Its capabilities could potentially match
doomsday scenarios about innovative technologies, but whether their
deployment on a global scale is in China's strategic interest is
unclear. **[To deal with future threats, transatlantic partners and NATO
specifically will have to consider disinformation in the context of the
complex existing and emerging security threats in order to develop
nimble and more proactive approaches]{.underline}**.

**[NATO and the United States are failing to curb Russian
aggression]{.underline}** in the midst of the Ukraine crisis. **[By only
using diplomatic forums, limited counter disinformation and continued
economic aid to Ukraine while unilaterally engaging Russia, we are
failing to meet the diversity of the effects of Russian aggression with
our own diversity of deterrence.]{.underline}**

**[NATO is a security architecture that still operates with a Cold War
mentality --- awkwardly sustaining hard power while ignoring the impact
of hybrid methodologies]{.underline}** despite recognizing them. **[The
answers are already known, but not acted upon: double-down on the
cooperation of liberal-minded states and fight
disinformation]{.underline}** **[with accurate and credible information
that discredits Moscow.]{.underline}**

Russia, of course, has been playing this game in Ukraine for some time.
**[Hybrid warfare]{.underline}** defies a single definition but
**[consists of a state using multiple vectors of intelligence,
information, cyber, conventional military and, at its core, political
efforts to divide adversaries while avoiding open conflict. Hybrid
warfare is indisputably how aggressor states subvert international
stability, and states concerned with maintaining rules-based
international order are not effectively responding]{.underline}** to the
threat that hybrid activities create.

**[What then, are the ways to deter this escalating threat and offset
the capacity for instability by the future use of hybrid
mechanisms?]{.underline}** **[The problem lies in both the complexity of
the adversary's capabilities and the old dictum of a legitimate,
rules-based body confronting a totalitarian regime: When fighting
against a ruthless adversary, the arena forces one to become just as
inhumane and ruthless --- in which case, how are we
different?]{.underline}**

**[An important aspect that those abiding by rules-based order seem slow
to realize and act upon is the aggressive use of exploitative
information to discredit and isolate Russia. In short, credible, damning
information is the inverse of disinformation. We live in a
hyper-connected world where trust in legitimate institutions has wavered
as a result of disinformation being used as]{.underline}** a
**[warfare]{.underline}** activity. **[While intelligence activities
have already shined a light on possible Russian false
flags]{.underline}**, to the surprise of no one concerned with the
broader situation in Ukraine, **[it does not serve as fodder for
delegitimizing Russian interference.]{.underline}**

**[Military and cyber capabilities employed to highlight Moscow's
activities in the public forum are a vector of countering hybrid
strategy that doesn't fall into the]{.underline}** aforementioned
**[dictum of becoming like the adversary.]{.underline}** Exploiting a
figurative and literal flank in the Arctic to create an inversion of the
Ukraine crisis for Moscow remains one vector that offers potential, but
the West has been slow to utilize that active theater. **[Electronic
warfare, the effects of which include collection and intelligence
gathering, as well as interference]{.underline}** against existing
architecture, **[remains yet another medium of deterrent power in which
Russia enjoys an advantage but one where the Western alliance can and
should invest resources to disrupt.]{.underline}**

**[While Russia moves across a variety of fronts to achieve political
end-states]{.underline}** (even if that iterative end state might simply
be creating instability to justify intervention) **[the alliance remains
reactive.]{.underline}**

**[Following the Russian incursion into Crimea]{.underline}** in 2014,
**[the U.S. bolstered economic aid and arms exports]{.underline}** to
Kyiv. Economic **[sanctions have been so overused as to no longer serve
as meaningful.]{.underline}** **[As Moscow massed conventional power at
sovereign borders]{.underline}** --- conventional military power still
matters --- **[the United States called for a summit. Even while
attempting to seize the information initiative by releasing intelligence
reports about Russian false flag operations pretexting an invasion,
Moscow summarily denied the reports amidst declining future dialogue on
defusing tensions.]{.underline}** The situation is not advanced or
improved by wavering commentary that fails to decry Moscow's aggression.

**[Political solutions already exist --- exemplified in the Pacific,
where Japan is leading regional efforts to bolster collective security
against Chinese aggression with the United States and Australia as key
partners]{.underline}**. I**[t would be a mistake to immediately lob
Beijing and Moscow into one monolith]{.underline}** of counter-liberal
power, **[but they should be viewed as similar,]{.underline}** distinct
problems **[with a common solution: unify the liberally minded states
into a common front and make concerted efforts to reverse the effects of
hybrid strategies]{.underline}**.

**[This isn't a new concept; it's simply being ignored. Indeed, the very
basis of hybrid warfare seeks to disaggregate collective institutions
that challenge authoritarianism near its borders.]{.underline}** This
thinking is precisely why Moscow has exploited its generous authorities
under the Collective Security Treaty Organization; the CSTO essentially
recreates the Eastern bloc of the Soviet era, allowing Russia to
insulate itself from perceived Western encroachment.

**[Rebuilding U.S. cohesion within the NATO and EU alliances is
critical. These relations have been fractured further by]{.underline}**
the United States leading **[a unilateral approach to negotiations with
Russia, largely excluding the rest of the alliance]{.underline}** and
Ukraine from the ineffective diplomatic process. **[The EU, whose
presidency has recently been assumed by French leadership bent on
reducing integration with the U.S., is hardly a cohesive unit capable of
effectively deterring Russian aggression on the European
continent.]{.underline}**

**[Thus, an aggressive engagement to rebuild relationships and unity in
the region --- combined with actions that bolster democratic
credibility, highlight unacceptable activities by aggressors and
solidify the fragile status of the Atlantic alliance --- are the obvious
course forward. Yet it seems that the United States and NATO are failing
to realize this reality before possible conflict breaks
out]{.underline}**.

[When Moscow attacked Ukraine in February, President Vladimir Putin
expected a quick victory.]{.underline}

[Not only did the Kremlin have military superiority, but it planned a
concerted cyber and information campaign to disrupt the Ukrainian state,
galvanize support among Russophones, weaken Western resolve and convince
Ukrainians that resistance is futile.]{.underline}

Much like its resistance in the streets and on the battlefield, Ukraine
has put up a remarkable defence against Moscow's unconventional warfare.

"I believe that this war has been going on, not since February 24, but
since the beginning of 2014, when Russia first attacked us," Mykhailo
Fedorov, [Ukraine's forward-looking vice prime minister and minister of
digital transformation, the man behind President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's
2019 win, told me in April from a location near Kyiv. "And as such, we
have had eight years to reform."]{.underline}

But while Federov may have helped prepare Ukraine for this moment,
[Russia's relentless efforts to destroy his country --- and its evident
resolve --- mean the country needs further defences. Kyiv requires help
that Western allied governments, including Canada, are in a position to
provide.]{.underline}

[The Kremlin's Global Disinformation Network Russia's propaganda and
disinformation apparatus is extraordinarily complex. Some outlets are
fully state-run, some are merely state-funded, and others are operated
at arm's length by Putin-linked oligarchs.]{.underline} The system
churns out conspiracy theories and whataboutism to aid Moscow's
objectives.

From the start of the all-out invasion on February 24, [Russian
disinformation has thumped on a series of narratives: that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) posed a security risk to the Russian
Federation; that Ukraine was run by neo-Nazis; that Ukraine is
responsible for slaughtering civilians on its own
territory.]{.underline}

Those narratives have, unfortunately, been somewhat effective in
discouraging a unified response from NATO. [They've influenced millions
of Westerners and found purchase with far-right and Russophilic
politicians the world over.]{.underline}

[The most visible Western response to date has been the collective
taking offline of Russia Today, or RT, the state-run television
network.]{.underline}

Yet trying to ban Russian media is a mug's game. Any outlets forbidden
by law or suspended by the social media giants would simply jump to the
Russian-founded social media platform Telegram, which abhors
regulation[.]{.underline}

[Rather than playing whack-a-mole outlet by outlet, Ukraine's allies
would be better off exposing how these disinformation networks work.
Many of these social media pages, self-styled think tanks, blogs and
media outlets are designed to look fully independent and
authentic.]{.underline} Efforts by Twitter, Alphabet and Meta to expose
them as disinformation have been inconsistent. Berlin-based, Moscow-run
video aggregator Ruptly is "state-affiliated media," according to
Twitter, but "state-controlled media" per Facebook; its "transparency"
feature notes that the outlet's page administrators are in three EU
countries, but doesn't name them.

Some smaller but perhaps more effective outlets --- such as the
French-language Donbass Insider, which has used manipulative practices
to spread Kremlin disinformation on its Facebook page --- carry no
disclaimer at all.

Plenty can be done to identify and expose who runs these propaganda
outlets. Western intelligence can help shed light on how they interact
and fit in with Russian intelligence efforts. But social media companies
also need to deny their advertising services to these state-controlled
outlets.

"What's the currency of disinformation?" Marko Suprun, a Kyiv-based host
and producer, asked me recently. "AdSense."

Google's advertising platform will hardly make any disinformation agent
rich. But Suprun says it has created "a bit of a cottage industry ---
they make enough money to survive."

If the companies drag their feet --- in particular, those companies that
have suspended operations in Russia but haven't closed up shop entirely
--- moving to publicly shame them could be quite effective, as Kyiv has
shown.

"What we're trying to emphasize is that there are no grey areas here,"
Fedorov told me. ["This is basically as good-versus-evil as it gets. So,
you either choose the path of good, and you stop operations in Russia
and you help fight disinformation. Or you choose the path of evil and
you stay in Russia and you pay taxes, which can, potentially, be used to
fund the army that's murdering civilians."]{.underline}

[For years, NATO has been skittish about deploying its newly beefed-up
cyber capacities, treating such powers as akin to missile strikes or
active warfare. Why Have a Cyber Command if You're Not Going to Use It?
When the Islamic State used its al-Hayat Media Center to recruit
Westerners to its cause, a US-based coalition bombed the group's
propaganda hubs and hacked its websites. Launching airstrikes in Moscow
is obviously not an option.]{.underline} But that doesn't mean NATO
can't take these stations offline. [After all, Russian disinformation
and hacking have targeted democratic systems and added fuel to extremist
movements in the West. Ukraine has already taken the fight to Russia's
doorstep. Aggressive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns have
knocked offline various elements of the Russian state.]{.underline} A
well-trained "IT Army," as Fedorov dubs it, has hacked major state
companies and dumped the personal information of their employees and
operations.

For years, NATO has been skittish about deploying its newly beefed-up
cyber capacities, treating such powers as akin to missile strikes or
active warfare. [Ahead of NATO's upcoming June summit, there are calls
to come up with a more flexible policy on cyber operations. Giving
member countries the freedom to target infrastructure used for malicious
cyber or disinformation activity would be a great place to
start.]{.underline}

[In effect, NATO countries should have the flexibility to degrade
Russia's ability to launch information and cyber operations against
Ukraine and the West.]{.underline} That doesn't mean launching an
operation that could be considered an act of war, such as knocking a
power plant offline (something Russia has done both to the United States
and Ukraine). It could mean, however, launching DDoS attacks on Russian
websites, or attempting to spearphish access to a Telegram channel
linked to the Wagner Group, a quasi-private military contractor. Those
operations would be both proportionate and plausibly deniable.

[The West also needs to help Kyiv continue its fight."We, of course,
need communications equipment, mostly satellite equipment --- including,
but not limited to, Starlink terminals," Fedorov told me. "So that we
can basically ensure connectivity whenever we can." And, he says,
although Ukraine has already been given a significant number of
workstations, laptops and tablets, it needs still more.]{.underline}

[Not all Kremlin support originates in Russia. As a 2020 report from the
US Department of State notes, an incredibly useful hub for Russian
disinformation is the Canada-based "Centre for Research on
Globalization."]{.underline} The website, the report notes, boasts a
"large roster of fringe authors and conspiracy theorists \[that\] serves
as a talent pool for Russian and Chinese websites."

Conspiracy theories that pop up on sites like these --- such as the
notion that Moscow is striking Ukraine to destroy US-funded biolabs
similar to the equally fictional ones that other conspiracists claim
gave us COVID-19 [--- have been adopted wholesale by
Moscow.]{.underline}

[Western intelligence agencies are aware, or should be aware, of the
level of involvement these hubs have with the Russian state. That State
Department report is a great first step toward declassifying far more
intelligence than is currently done. Washington and London have started
along that path, but all NATO members should engage --- in both
countering falsehoods and explaining to the world how Moscow creates,
supports and amplifies them.]{.underline}

### AT -- Attacker Has Advantage

#### The attacker's advantage is not absolute if the defender can signal its debunking capacity and rally the international audience by reducing its engagement in its own disinformation campaigns.

https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4098988, accessed 7-5-2022) SS:/

Our model posits that [deterrence in international information war can
be attainable through two venues]{.underline}: [first, if the Defender
can successfully signal its debunking capacity to the Attacker, and
second, if the Defender can demonstrate its ability to rally the
international audience to its cause quickly enough.]{.underline} [The
first condition is attainable through building and maintaining a robust
fact-checking ecosystem]{.underline} either [within the government
ranks, or the civil society]{.underline}, but ideally both. [If a
Defender regularly demonstrates rapid and successful debunking
performance in past interactions, the Attacker's valuation of its
short-term utility by deploying disinformation will likely be
reduced.]{.underline} [Since one of the core drivers of disinformation
is the Attacker's high valuation of its short-term demobilizing and
distracting potential against its adversaries, those adversaries can in
turn demonstrate that they can debunk and disseminate accurate news
rapidly in order to reduce the Attacker's perceived
payoffs.]{.underline}

[The second condition is attainable through diplomatic alliances, media
and cultural power, and fewer reliance on fake news as a government
strategy in past information interactions. If the Defender has regularly
used disinformation as a conscious strategy in past interactions -- more
so compared to the Attacker -- it will be harder for the IA to rally
behind the Defender's cause.]{.underline} To that end [not resorting to
disinformation is a cumulative resource that countries 'save' over time,
and can 'cash-in' during emergencies, by rendering the IA more receptive
towards its cause.]{.underline}

This chapter has identified two important dynamics. First, [the fact
that]{.underline} [disinformation may incur reputational and suspicion
costs to the Attacker suggests that there must be greater short-term
gains for the Attacker so that it prefers spreading fake
news]{.underline}. This reasoning advances the prevalent wisdom that
states engage in disinformation because it is a cheap way of
demobilizing an adversary and there are no repercussions against this
form of action. Second, [Defenders are not as completely vulnerable to
disinformation campaigns as the mainstream debate suggests and the
Attacker's advantage in information warfare is no absolute.]{.underline}
[The Attacker chooses to engage in organized disinformation because it
believes that the Defender will not be able to debunk these claims on
time and at scale. If the Defender demonstrates the opposite reliably,
then the Attacker's decision to launch a disinformation campaign is not
a given and automatic, and may be deterred from choosing this course of
action.]{.underline} In addition, [the Defender may deter the Attacker
through its influence over the IA, by not regularly engaging in
disinformation campaigns itself and optimizing its cultural and media
power, which accumulates over time, through 'good
practices'.]{.underline}

We expect a number of criticisms on our model. First, [we concede that
the Defender may not be isolated into a single decision to automatically
debunk all disinformation attempts. It can indeed choose not to take
action, or spread disinformation itself to win the short-term
information war.]{.underline} This is indeed an important point, but
empirically, [such cases have been so rare that modelling them within
the same parameters of likelihood with the rest of our model can be
misleading.]{.underline} Second, [we anticipate that our decision to
include the International Audience as a decision-making actor may incur
too much agency on it,]{.underline} as in most cases IA's likelihood of
believing disinformation or not is very deterministic: if the Attacker
is skilful and can generate sufficient emotional triggers, the IA has a
likelihood of believing the disinformation. Also, pre-existing beliefs
about the Attacker and the Defender matters significantly in driving the
momentum of the IA. [However, we believe that the IA is the actual
kingmaker in this interaction and its gravitational dynamics impact the
outcome of the information war. To that end, we favour retaining the
agency of the IA.]{.underline}

### AT -- Internal Disinfo Alt Cause

#### NATO itself can coordinate to upgrade national safeguards against democratic backsliding

[Although defending human and physical infrastructure from asymmetric
threats is inherently national business, **NATO itself can serve as a
platform for coordinating allied responses to these
challenges.**]{.underline} NATO allies agreed on seven baseline
requirements for national resilience at their 2016 Warsaw Summit. They
have also "improve\[d\] their cyber resilience by introducing capability
targets" into the NATO Defence Planning Process.

Recently, however, national resilience has been challenged in additional
areas, which should be reflected. [Specifically, NATO should address
democratic backsliding, election interference, and economic and
information manipulation]{.underline}. Specifically, **[NATO's
requirements for national resilience should be upgraded to require
national safeguards against democratic backsliding.]{.underline}** Prior
to taking up her position as the senior U.S. Department of Defense
official in Europe, Rachel Ellehuus highlighted the vulnerabilities laid
bare by such backsliding and argued that "the trans-Atlantic alliance
will only remain strong if members genuinely abide by its founding
principles." [By incorporating such safeguards into NATO's systems for
monitoring allies' defense preparations, allies can shape one another's
political, economic, and security incentives in ways that reduce these
vulnerabilities.]{.underline}

[In cyber warfare, damage can be done in both physical and cognitive
spheres. To achieve such damages, cyberspace can be used in multiple
ways.]{.underline} It embodies software, hardware, and infrastructure as
well. [Information war has a broader scope, and can mean "a wide array
of activities \[...\], the spreading of disinformation, electronic
warfare, the degradation of navigation support,]{.underline}
[psychological pressure]{.underline}, and the destruction of adversary
computer capabilities."5 [Overall, cyber warfare can be applied for
offensive and defensive purposes.]{.underline}

[In observing Russian cyber warfare-related practices
today,]{.underline} experts6 claim that the legacy of the Soviet Union
is still evident. [There are operations in cyberspace that strive for
the alteration/influence of policies of other nations, in a secret way,
using illegal means. The manipulation of information is a way of doing
this.]{.underline} [Another example of operations that can be paralleled
with Soviet-era methods is the one that encompasses concealment and
deception so that the other party makes mistakes because of false pieces
of information.]{.underline} [Cyberattacks used in the current conflict
can be classified into three main categories. One group is called
wipers. Such attacks delete information from networks or block
data.]{.underline} Another type of cyberattack is DDoS (Distributed
Denial of Service) attacks. These impede the access of websites, by
"overwhelming a system via an excessive number of 'requests' --- people
trying to access a website --- in a short space of time." [7 Defacement
attacks, on the other hand, operate on the psychological or cognitive
level: they eliminate or modify pieces of information from websites,
thus facilitating the dissemination of disinformation and fake
news.8]{.underline}

documents[. In NATO Basic Texts, the most-preferred reference keyword is
'hybrid warfare', whereas in press releases, reliance on the word

[The EU and US diverge in terms of constitutional and human rights

feed into their non-aligned approach to disinformation]{.underline}.
[Aggravating the complexity of coordinating regulatory efforts is the
fact that the debate in the US revolves around freedom of expression and
the framing of efforts to constrain the power of Big Tech as being
anti-free market]{.underline}, when in the EU freedom of expression is a
qualified right that has to be balanced with other rights such as
privacy.169 [The EU sees regulation as mainly a systemic
issue]{.underline} and seeks to address disinformation by looking across
different domains, from tech regulation to privacy frameworks and
information markets, [while the US institutional approach indicates an
interpretation as an agent problem and allocates responsibility to
federal agencies]{.underline} to focus on manipulation campaigns of
state actors like Russia, Iran or China. Nevertheless, investigations

**[Political solutions already exist --- exemplified in the Pacific,
where Japan is leading regional efforts to bolster collective security
against Chinese aggression with the United States and Australia as key
partners]{.underline}**. I**[t would be a mistake to immediately lob
Beijing and Moscow into one monolith]{.underline}** of counter-liberal
power, **[but they should be viewed as similar,]{.underline}** distinct
problems **[with a common solution: unify the liberally minded states
into a common front and make concerted efforts to reverse the effects of
hybrid strategies]{.underline}**.

**[This isn't a new concept; it's simply being ignored. Indeed, the very
basis of hybrid warfare seeks to disaggregate collective institutions
that challenge authoritarianism near its borders.]{.underline}** This
thinking is precisely why Moscow has exploited its generous authorities
under the Collective Security Treaty Organization; the CSTO essentially
recreates the Eastern bloc of the Soviet era, allowing Russia to
insulate itself from perceived Western encroachment.

**[Rebuilding U.S. cohesion within the NATO and EU alliances is
critical. These relations have been fractured further by]{.underline}**
the United States leading **[a unilateral approach to negotiations with
Russia, largely excluding the rest of the alliance]{.underline}** and
Ukraine from the ineffective diplomatic process. **[The EU, whose
presidency has recently been assumed by French leadership bent on
reducing integration with the U.S., is hardly a cohesive unit capable of
effectively deterring Russian aggression on the European
continent.]{.underline}**

**[Thus, an aggressive engagement to rebuild relationships and unity in
the region --- combined with actions that bolster democratic
credibility, highlight unacceptable activities by aggressors and
solidify the fragile status of the Atlantic alliance --- are the obvious
course forward. Yet it seems that the United States and NATO are failing
to realize this reality before possible conflict breaks
out]{.underline}**.

#### NATO and EU already have their own ways of checking disinformation - they can cooperate with each other in a cohesive way that allows for both organizations to solve better through cooperation

[The common challenges of disinformation and fake news have led to
enhanced NATO -- EU cooperation]{.underline}, with [both organisations
acknowledging that disinformation, propaganda, and fake news are
challenges that put increasing pressure on the resilience of democratic
systems.]{.underline}

[This trend has increased during the pandemic, as state and non-state
actors have exploited the current situation to further their own
interests by trying to sow divisions and undermine liberal societies and
democracies]{.underline}. The fight against disinformation is more
important than ever as the pandemic intensifies competition between
different political models, testing the strength of democratic systems
and the values of human rights across the world. If left unchecked,
these trends risk undermining the foundations and legitimacy of the
rules-based international order.

In several instances, in the context of the pandemic, disinformation has
been aimed at eroding trust in the readiness of NATO troops in Central
and Eastern Europe[. As such, raising awareness and strengthening
collective defences against sources of disinformation and the hostile
actors behind them has become critical.]{.underline}

[In this context, the importance of enhanced NATO -- EU cooperation on
countering disinformation and propaganda has been highlighted by both
institutions, and several measures aimed at countering these trends have
already been identified and implemented.]{.underline}

[The EU has set up a Rapid Alert System among EU institutions and member
states in order to spot and tackle coordinated disinformation
campaigns]{.underline}. The EU has also worked closely with big internet
platforms to sign up to a Code of Practice on Disinformation, asking
them, among other things, to disrupt the advertising revenues of those
behind disinformation, take greater action against bots, and make
political advertising more transparent.

[NATO meanwhile is also closely monitoring disinformation and countering
it with democratic values and facts]{.underline}. NATO is continuing to
work with all of its allies as well as partners to identify, expose and
counter disinformation.

[Both NATO and the EU have stressed the need to support free independent
media, a key building block of democratic systems]{.underline}. Other
key pillars in the fight against disinformation are governments and
international organisations, which must call out disinformation and
counter it with facts, and citizens, who must learn to understand
hostile information and to check that their news and information comes
from reliable sources.

#### EU- NATO cooperation is already present, but further cooperation between the two organizations is necessary for long term mitigation of rising threats.

[NATO -- EU cooperation and coordination has never been closer,
especially when it comes to countering hybrid threats, disinformation
and cyberattacks.]{.underline} The current crisis has further reinforced
the importance of cooperation and partnership, and the necessity to
access the idle potential of synergies. This makes further cooperation
possible, and indeed highly likely.

[Enhanced cooperation on resilience between the EU and NATO could result
in the short-term in a standardising of procedures and methods, in the
medium-term in a joint assessment and awareness of threats and trends
emerging on the event horizon, while in the long-term, it might lead to
a coordinated response to a problem that shows no signs of
abating.]{.underline}

## Canada CP Answers

### Canada CP Answer -- Perm Do Both

#### Canada should work with US to exert its power

Order", in The Palgrave Handbook of Canada in International Affairs,

**[Canada also has to participate actively in the creation of the
emerging international order, especially in fora with the
US]{.underline}** and PRC, **[individually or together]{.underline}**.
Clark (2014, 6) notes that "**[the ability to bridge conflicting
identities and hostile groups, and patiently seek enough common ground
to build trust and collaboration, is critically needed]{.underline}**,"
and "no one is better at it than Canada". **[Canada needs to build on
its reputation as a 'helpful fixer']{.underline}** or 'mediator' **[to
construct coalitions of like-minded state and non-state actors on issues
of importance]{.underline}** (see Nagy, Chapter 29) **[even when the US
and China take a contradictory position.]{.underline}** This will be
neither easy, nor without consequence, as demonstrated by China's
'wolf-warrior' diplomacy and Trump's unpredictability, each seeking to
measure the depth of commitment of Canada and other states to their
positions. Previously, **[Canada has demonstrated that when it takes the
lead and works with strategic friends, it can move the international
commu- nity to action,]{.underline}** as in the case of Ottawa

### Canada CP Answer -- No Middle Power/Liberal Order Solvency

#### Canada doesn't have power to guide global order

**Paikin, Research Fellow, Institute for Peace & Diplomacy, 21**

(Dr. Zachary, and a Researcher at the Centre for European Policy Studies
in Brussels (CEPS), "Is Canada Still a Middle Power?", April 22,
<https://peacediplomacy.org/2021/04/22/is-canada-still-a-middle-power/>,
GDI, access 7/8/22)

The reality is that **[the core pillars that guided Canadian foreign
policy throughout the second half of the 20th century are no longer
present]{.underline}** in today's world. A special relationship with
Washington and reliable access to the U.S. market can no longer be taken
for granted. **[Multilateralism is, if not in crisis, then at least in a
period of profound transition]{.underline}**. And n**[ot only will
Atlanticism lose its relative importance as the global distribution of
power shifts eastward, it has also become an uncertain means of
constraining American unilateralism]{.underline}** in an era that
features an increasingly zero-sum great power rivalry.

**[Canada will need to face up to this new world with intellectual
clarity. It must soberly assess the extent to which developments in
distant]{.underline}** yet adjacent geographic
**[theatres]{.underline}**, such as Europe and Asia**[, genuinely affect
its national security and prosperity]{.underline}**. If it determines
that the impact of such developments is minimal in relative terms, then
**[Canada should abandon its outdated rhetoric of being a "leading
middle power" that "punches above its weight]{.underline}**" and content
itself with the security provided by vassal status. Ottawa could retain
an independent trade policy but **[would cease its efforts to conduct an
independent foreign policy, which in many ways now differs from U.S.
foreign policy more symbolically than substantively.]{.underline}**
Canada would continue to police the North American continent to the
minimal extent necessary to ensure its formal independence from a
southern neighbour that views continental defence and its national
security as synonymous. Such a strategy would align well with a
post-hegemonic world in which local actors are increasingly assuming
responsibility for managing their own regional affairs.

Alternatively**[, if Canada's leadership decides that its security
interests do not stop at the water's edge, then it must develop a
bipartisan, long-term strategy that lays out which national resources
will be developed or deployed in the name of pursuing those interests.
This must be accompanied by a conceptual framework that explains how
Canada's varied interests across different regional theatres can be
coalesced into a coherent national strategic posture.]{.underline}**

Although technically a member of the G7, **[it is difficult to argue
that Canada is as geopolitically prominent a country]{.underline}** as
France, Germany or Japan in today's world. **[In part due to its
underinvestment in Asia in a decade where the Sino-American rivalry will
take centre stage, it may already be too late for Canada to play a
substantive role in shaping global order]{.underline}** over the medium
term. But as a country with a growing population and a proud history of
international engagement, Canada cannot avoid asking itself what kind of
international actor it wants to be as this century unfolds. Does it
genuinely want to -- or even need to -- work hard to regain middle power
status at a time when global power is becoming increasingly diffuse, or
can it be content with the real-world and psychological consequences of
possessing more limited ambitions?

## K Answers

### Security K Answer - Permutation

#### Perm - Studying how NATO evolves by securitizing disinformation creates long-term insights into NATO security planning and amity-enmity threat construction.

The logic of interpreting how disinformation gets securitized by relying
on NATO documents is two-fold: first, [NATO has been evolving to find
new *raisons d'être* since the end of the Cold War and has sought to
capitalize on the securitization of new threats, such as]{.underline}
terrorism, [cybersecurity,]{.underline} Syria, and forced migration.^38^
[Disinformation and information war are two of the recent additions to
this threat portfolio]{.underline} that helps us understand how NATO's
discourses on security adapt to a new-medium threat. Second, it enables
us to understand how [institutional security arrangements like NATO
reinvent their security identities and construct their amity-enmity
relations in light of newer technologies.]{.underline} [Since identity
and action are considered closely linked in constructivism, and because
they are never fixed or intrinsic, but are rather fluid and constituted
through social processes, studying longitudinal securitization dynamics
gives us valuable insight into long-term NATO security
planning.]{.underline}^39^

### Security/IR K -- Alternative Fails

#### No alternative spillover -- won't change real world policymaking

**Satoh, Co-Director IAFOR Research Centre, Osaka School of
International Public Policy, 21**

Needless to say, **[the theoretical and philosophical discussions for
this less state-centric definition of security are anchored in the
English school and liberal internationalists. But more often than not
their contribution is obscured by the disagreements within the aca-
demic discipline of international relations theory, if they are not
pitted against the dominant realists and neo-realists to compete for an
authoritative voice. A discernable challenge is how much impact the
academic, theoretical debates have on policymakers, particularly those
in the foreign and security policy community of great
powers]{.underline}**. This is not to say that the theoretical world
that offers a more nuanced approach to international relations has had
no bearing on the real policy world and conducts of great powers. Nor do
the realists, particularly prevalent in the US, only see the world in
the classical balance of military power terms, if only because of the
"discovery" of the utility of power of persuasion, or soft power, as an
effective tool of American diplomacy in winning friends in the Cold War.
But **[in mainstream policy discussions about geopolitical competition
between the US and China, there appears little room for
nuance.]{.underline}**
