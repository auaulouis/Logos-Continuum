## Notes

#### Thanks to Charles and Sasha for creating this file.

#### This file can be used as a standalone argument and in conjunction with the Security K file. This is especially true for the aff to pull additional answers, the realism debate, framework, etc. 

#### There are multiple versions of the 1nc. The primary difference is the alternative with Abolition arguing that reforming security is impossible while Racialized Securitization calls for a rethinking of security.

#### International Relations and securitized crises are rooted in dominant norms of presumed whiteness and structural racism

Relations, 21**  (V Spike, 2021, Security Dialogue2021, Vol. 52(S)

[Racism is the oil in the system of colonial power that makes a
sustained discrimination of and violence against certain people not only
possible but also invisible and acceptable]{.underline}. (Rutazibwa,
2016: 196, emphasis added) T[he world is undeniably in trouble. Crises
and corollary insecurities are legible everywhere, marked by
environmental degradation, healthcare panics, stark inequalities,
militarized conflicts, and the rise of authoritarian movements and
virulent alt-right populisms.]{.underline} That racism figures in
producing and structuring these entwined crises is widely recognized,
and, given its disciplinary remit, international relations is best
positioned to examine 'the link between race as a structuring principle
and the transnational processes of accumulation, dispossession, violence
and struggle that emerge in its wake' (Anievas et al., 2015: 9). **[Yet
international relations' problematic engagement with race is now
well-documented, including the discipline's 'origin' as an imperial
racist project]{.underline}** (Vitalis, 2015), **[the 'willful amnesia'
that this encouraged (Krishna, 2001: 401), and the legacy of 'racist
epistemological assumptions that inform much of contemporary mainstream
and even critical analyses of world politics']{.underline}** (Sajed,
2016a: 168; see also Grovogui, 1996; Hobson, 2012; Gruffydd Jones,
2016). Revisiting points made in his 1997 book, Charles [Mills (2015b:
542) concludes that 'the racial contract is very much alive and well . .
. and the "epistemology of ignorance" that now guards it is as active as
ever'.]{.underline}

But the problem is larger. **[Despite abundant evidence of
institutionalized racism, international relations persists not only in
habitual neglect and a deeply flawed theorization of race, but also in
actively resisting, marginalizing, depoliticizing, and hence
devalorizing anti-racist research and those who produce
it]{.underline}** (Bhambra et al., 2020; Chowdhry and Rai, 2009;
El-Malik, 2015; Shilliam, 2020; Vitalis, 2015). [Given epistemological
priorities, we might expect this resistance by conventionally
ahistorical, non-reflexive mainstream scholars]{.underline}. **[But it
is unexpected and poses fundamental questions when ardent resistance to
critique is practiced by self-identified critical scholars, whose
objectives presumably extend beyond the production of 'more accurate
descriptions' to include the reduction, or at least mitigation, of
structural violence.]{.underline}** [How is it possible for those who
claim a critical orientation to be so ill-prepared, and evidently
unwilling, to address 'the daily, structural racism that unmistakably
continues to plague our societies' (Rutazibwa, 2016: 192)? What
taken-for-granted premises and practices reproduce the invisibility of
racism and the apparent acceptance of its harms]{.underline}? [What are
we failing to 'see', and how does this compromise what critical security
studies and international relations scholars have to offer, especially
in the face of mounting crises and the urgency of developing more
adequate analyses?]{.underline}

**[Taking the social violence of systemic (structural,
institutionalized) racism as its starting point, my essay assumes that
race 'is a central organizing feature of world politics']{.underline}**
(Zvobgo and Loken, 2020), that '**[epistemic racism is intrinsic to
Western knowledge structures']{.underline}** **[and pervades
international relations theorizing]{.underline}** (Howell and
Richter-Montpetit, 2020: 4; see also Gruffydd Jones, 2016; Sabaratnam,
2020), **[and that 'taking the problem of racism seriously in the field
of \[international relations\] means viewing it not merely as an issue
of stereotypes or cultural insensitivities, but as a colonial technology
of life and premature death built on ideologies of whiteness and white
supremacy']{.underline}** (Rutazibwa, 2020). My forum intervention,
then, takes up Olivia Rutazibwa's (2016: 199) call 'to contribute to a
radically different, anti- or non-racist \[international relations\] and
everyday', and I do so by examining how the **[everyday and everywhere
power relations of white privilege make the reproduction of racism 'not
only possible but also invisible and acceptable']{.underline}**
(Rutazibwa, 2016: 196). While I address the forum's focus on racism, I
note that more adequate critical theorizing is undermined if the
reciprocally constructed phenomena of structural inequalities and
systems of privilege are treated in isolation.

#### NATO's roots and ideological foundations are guided and sustained by racism and anti-Blackness

**[Race is not a perspective on international relations; it is a central
organizing feature of world politics.]{.underline}**
[Anti-Japanese]{.underline} **[racism guided and sustained U.S.
engagement in World War II,]{.underline}** [**and** broader anti-Asian
sentiment]{.underline} **[influenced the development and structure of
the North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}** **[Organization.]{.underline}**
During the Cold War, **[racism and anti-communism were inextricably
linked in the containment strategy that defined Washington's approach to
Africa, Asia, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. And
today race shapes threat perception and responses to violent extremism,
inside and outside the "war on terror."]{.underline}** [Yet mainstream
international relations (IR) scholarship denies race as essential to
understanding the world, to the cost of the field's
integrity.]{.underline}

Take the "big three" IR paradigms: **[realism, liberalism, and
constructivism. These dominant frames for understanding global politics
are built on raced and racist intellectual foundations that limit the
field's ability to answer important questions about international
security and organization]{.underline}**. **[Core concepts, like anarchy
and hierarchy, are raced]{.underline}**: [They are rooted in discourses
that center and favor Europe and the West.]{.underline} **[These
concepts implicitly and explicitly pit "developed" against
"undeveloped," "modern" against "primitive," "civilized" against
"uncivilized." And their use is racist]{.underline}**: [These invented
binaries are used to explain subjugation and exploitation around the
globe]{.underline}

**[While realism and liberalism were built on Eurocentrism and used to
justify white imperialism,]{.underline}** [this fact is not widely
acknowledged in the field.]{.underline} For instance, [**according to
neorealists, there exists a "balance of power" between and among "great
powers." Most of these great powers are, not incidentally,
white-majority states, and they sit atop the hierarchy, with small and
notably less-white powers organized below them**. In a similar vein,
raced hierarchies and conceptions of control ground the concept of
cooperation in neoliberal thought: Major powers own the proverbial
table, set the chairs, and arrange the place settings.]{.underline}

[Constructivism, which rounds out the "big three" approaches, is perhaps
best positioned to tackle race and racism. Constructivists reject the
as-given condition of anarchy and maintain that anarchy, security, and
other concerns are socially constructed based on shared ideas,
histories, and experiences. **Yet with few notable exceptions,
constructivists rarely acknowledge how race shapes what is
shared.**]{.underline}

#### The security logics of the plan uphold the racialization practices of the colonial empire and is intrinsically rooted in white supremacy

**Machold, University of Glasgow Lecturer in International Relations in
Politics and Charrett**, **University of Westminster Senior Lecturer in
Global Politics, 21**  (Rhys and Catherine, 2021, Security Dialogue2021,
Vol. 52(S) 38--48, \"Beyond ambivalence: Locating thewhiteness of
security\", https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09670106211031044,
pages 7-8 accessed on 7-8-2022 hooch//cs)

Answering this question requires taking stock of how critical security
studies' orientation to security squares with wider questions concerning
power and structure in global politics. In developing non-traditional
approaches to security, critical security studies has cultivated an
important critical distance from state security and (neo)realist
accounts of war-making as security. Guided by an imperative to decentre
material relationships, however[, critical security studies has embraced
a commitment to open-ended and ambivalent accounts of power, which
unmoor security from histories and structures (Barkawi, 2011). As a
result, critical security studies broadly (and its poststructuralist
variants in particular) 'fail\[s\] . . . to adequately situate security
within complex entanglements with other technologies of
power']{.underline} (Coleman and Rosenow, 2016: 203). [This tendency to
abstract security from wider power configurations, we suggest, has
largely precluded critical approaches to security from apprehending
racism as a structural form of power in global politics that serves
capital and colonial prerogatives -- albeit with notable
exceptions]{.underline} (e.g. AbuBakare, 2020; Ali, 2020; Axster et al.,
2021; Eastwood, 2019; Manchanda and Rossdale, 2021). **[This poses a
specific problem for any critical engagement of racism in relation to
security: Racism only makes sense as a form of power and technology of
governing insofar as it does specific kinds of work, namely,
(re)producing differences and hierarchies in the service of capital and
empire]{.underline}**. **[To imply that 'security' can be bracketed off
from and thereby detached from its imbrication in long histories of
race-making, capitalism and empire]{.underline}** (Jelly-Schapiro, 2018;
Singh, 2017) **[is naïve, untenable and complicit in the (re)production
of structural white supremacy.]{.underline}**

As a corrective to these tendencies, we suggest that [security needs to
be apprehended as a concept, a set of power relations and governing
regimes]{.underline} **[that are dynamic but do specific work for
capital, colonization and, hence, race-making.]{.underline}** To this
end, we call for a closer engagement with three sets of literature.
First, we argue that [Marxist critiques of security and pacification
theory can help locate security materially within ongoing histories of
imperial, colonial and capitalist domination. Yet, while these
theorizations of security crucially foreground material and ideological
considerations, their core texts engage only tangentially with questions
of race and racism]{.underline}. Thus, second, we suggest that [critical
security studies needs to engage with theoretical traditions that
situate race and racism as foundational to capitalism and the
maintenance of the colonial/modern world system]{.underline} (Quijano,
2000, 2007). We detail some key insights from these literatures, which
illuminate the particular work security does for racial domination and
violent dispossession. Third, and finally, in contrast to longstanding
currents in critical security studies that locate security as a source
of emancipation (Booth, 1991), we argue that security needs to be
dismantled by engaging with abolitionist thought and praxis.

Drawing on these literatures, we begin to unpack the [foundationally
raced precepts of security and offer some suggestions for critical
security research]{.underline}. We argue [that race cannot be 'tacked
on' as a qualifier but needs to be addressed as a structure that informs
how we apprehend security in the first instance. In]{.underline} doing
so, **[we locate security as a justification for violence and the
legitimation of the mechanisms through which this violence is
waged]{.underline}**. We suggest that critical [security studies needs
to reckon more seriously with how security projects and the kinds of
social orders they enact are always already racial orders **too,
predicated on the production of racialized 'Others' in need of
elimination.**]{.underline} The focus should be on interrogating how
processes [of racialization work in relation to security, along with the
structures they depend on and the ends they serve.]{.underline}
'**[Security', we argue, is the term used both to hide racial violence
and Native dispossession and annihilation and to legitimate this same
violence.]{.underline}** [Drawing on terminology from literature on the
imperial origins and raced foundations of police (Singh, 2014), we call
on critical security studies to contend with what we call the whiteness
of security.]{.underline} This can assist efforts to locate **[the
particular roles that security plays in the normalization of
group-differentiated violence]{.underline}** (Gilmore, 2002) [and the
forms of value accrued therein. Locating the whiteness of security,
however, does not imply that racial categories and their attending power
structures, sites and objects of violence are stable and totalizing --
quite the contrary]{.underline}. While we spell out some new analytical
and political avenues, there is much more to be said about how
**[security is implicated in material dispossession and race-making
beyond what we are able to detail here]{.underline}**. We propose five
starting points for apprehending the intersections of race--security.

#### Alternative -- Only abandoning the epistemic core and infrastructural framework of international relations can open a new disciplinary agenda

**Sen, Roskilde University International Development Studies Associate
Professor, 21** (Somdeep, "Colouring critical security studies: A view
from the classroom", Security Dialogue, 2021, Vol. 52(S) 133-141, EBSCO,
GDI access 7/12/22)

The question remains**[: What would a non-racist discipline look like?
It is presumptuous to think that any number of reparative pedagogical
strategies would allow us to simply escape international relations'
historically entrenched racist precepts.]{.underline}** Aijaz Ahmad
(1992: 77) once wrote that 'history is not really open to correction
through a return passage to an imaginary point, centuries ago, before
the colonial deformation set in'. Ahmad was of course referring to the
English language and the feasibility of effacing it as an integral facet
of the colonized people's identity (for further dis- cussion, see Sen,
2020b: 142-146). Without stretching this metaphor too far, I would argue
that **[international relations' racist history is not open to course
correction]{.underline}** either. But while we cannot change this
history, we can choose what to do with it.

At the outset, then, **[this requires the recognition of a foundational
dilemma,]{.underline}** namely, **[that racism is not just an aspect of
international relations: it characterizes the very nature and purpose of
the discipline]{.underline}**. **[A non-racist international relations
would thus need to position itself as not just an endeavour to add a
critical pillar within the existent white-supremacist disciplinary
structures and norms. It would need be something else
altogether.]{.underline}** For one thing, cognizant of the racialized
intel- lectual foundations of international relations as it is taught
today, **[the non-racist international rela- tions would look elsewhere
for the intellectual building blocks of a new epistemic
core]{.underline}**. To this end, it would need to draw on a
well-established (albeit ignored and marginalized) legacy of scholarship
within international relations that has deliberated the role of racism
and white supremacy in the making of the global order. However, the
purpose of this scholarly legacy in the non-racist disci- pline is
**[not to simply speak to the mainstream from the outside
in]{.underline}** or languish in the category of 'critical approaches'
that often appears at the back end of international relations curricula
and textbooks. **[Instead, in a non-racist international relations, the
works]{.underline}** of, among others, Alain Locke (\[1916\] 1992), W.
E. B. Du Bois (1903, 1915) and Merze Tate (1943, 1961), along with the
more recent scholarly engagement with questions of race and racism,2
**[would be placed at the very top of the disciplinary hierarchy as the
mainstream and recognized for their indispensable contribution to the
scholarly agenda of international relations.]{.underline}**

**[However, the racism of international relations is not just a matter
of its core intellectuality ori- entation. It is equally reflected in
the material consequences]{.underline}** of its racist precepts, evident
not least in hirings, tenure decisions and grant-giving practices.
**[All of these act as the infrastructure that keeps up the colour line
and function as a nexus of (dis)incentives that renders it
professionally unwise to critique international relations' racialized
epistemic core]{.underline}**. In contrast, in the non-racist
international relations, practitioners of the discipline would not need
to fear - as I did - the optics and consequences of critiquing
international relations' racist legacy. On the contrary, such efforts
would be deemed an extension of the core purpose of the non-racist
discipline. **[Seen together]{.underline}**, what I propose **[here is
the abandoning of international relations in its current
form]{.underline}**. **[However, theorizing 'interstate
relations']{.underline}** (Weber, 2015: 29; for further discussion, see
Wight, 1960; Cox, 1981) **[remains a worthwhile disciplinary agenda. And
the non-racist international relations can make an invalua- ble
contribution to this agenda by revealing the multiple, positioned ways
in which politics is understood and experienced.]{.underline}**

everyday', and I do so by examining how the **[everyday and everywhere
power relations of white privilege make the reproduction of racism 'not
only possible but also invisible and acceptable']{.underline}**
(Rutazibwa, 2016: 196). While I address the forum's focus on racism, I
note that more adequate critical theorizing is undermined if the
reciprocally constructed phenomena of structural inequalities and
systems of privilege are treated in isolation.

#### **Traditional disinformation scholarship encodes a frame white-racial neutrality reinforcing othering narratives.**

Attentiveness to othering as a form of identity propaganda is crucial to
understanding the structure of these appeals. Indeed, [in scholarship on
misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda, scholars often
categorize content targeting or featuring non-white subjects as "racial"
while failing to code appeals to white subjects as "racial"]{.underline}
(Kreiss, 2021). [Researchers often avoid naming "whiteness"]{.underline}
by masking it with codes such as "Southern Culture" or "Confederate
History" (e.g. DiResta et al., 2018). Scholars from various fields
across the social sciences (Bonilla and Silva, 2018; Corbin, 2017;
Frankenberg, 1993; Sue, 2006) have pointed out that [whiteness is immune
to othering narratives because white identity is the standard against
which non-white identity is othered.]{.underline} As a result, [white
racial frames in identity propaganda are less likely to be considered as
racially targeted content---even as white subjects often serve as the
primary audiences for othering narratives. By imparting the privilege of
racial-neutrality on white racial identity, many researchers ignore the
racial structures in place that enable the creation of this content in
the first place. Centering racial analysis]{.underline} through the
concept of identity propaganda---including [analysis of
whiteness---enables researchers to better see the underlying goals and
coded rationales of identity propaganda.]{.underline}

#### The security logics of the plan uphold the racialization practices of the colonial empire and is intrinsically rooted in white supremacy

Answering this question requires taking stock of how critical security
studies' orientation to security squares with wider questions concerning
power and structure in global politics. In developing non-traditional
approaches to security, critical security studies has cultivated an
important critical distance from state security and (neo)realist
accounts of war-making as security. Guided by an imperative to decentre
material relationships, however[, critical security studies has embraced
a commitment to open-ended and ambivalent accounts of power, which
unmoor security from histories and structures (Barkawi, 2011). As a
result, critical security studies broadly (and its poststructuralist
variants in particular) 'fail\[s\] . . . to adequately situate security
within complex entanglements with other technologies of
power']{.underline} (Coleman and Rosenow, 2016: 203). [This tendency to
abstract security from wider power configurations, we suggest, has
largely precluded critical approaches to security from apprehending
racism as a structural form of power in global politics that serves
capital and colonial prerogatives -- albeit with notable
exceptions]{.underline} (e.g. AbuBakare, 2020; Ali, 2020; Axster et al.,
2021; Eastwood, 2019; Manchanda and Rossdale, 2021). **[This poses a
specific problem for any critical engagement of racism in relation to
security: Racism only makes sense as a form of power and technology of
governing insofar as it does specific kinds of work, namely,
(re)producing differences and hierarchies in the service of capital and
empire]{.underline}**. **[To imply that 'security' can be bracketed off
from and thereby detached from its imbrication in long histories of
race-making, capitalism and empire]{.underline}** (Jelly-Schapiro, 2018;
Singh, 2017) **[is naïve, untenable and complicit in the (re)production
of structural white supremacy.]{.underline}**

As a corrective to these tendencies, we suggest that [security needs to
be apprehended as a concept, a set of power relations and governing
regimes]{.underline} **[that are dynamic but do specific work for
capital, colonization and, hence, race-making.]{.underline}** To this
end, we call for a closer engagement with three sets of literature.
First, we argue that [Marxist critiques of security and pacification
theory can help locate security materially within ongoing histories of
imperial, colonial and capitalist domination. Yet, while these
theorizations of security crucially foreground material and ideological
considerations, their core texts engage only tangentially with questions
of race and racism]{.underline}. Thus, second, we suggest that [critical
security studies needs to engage with theoretical traditions that
situate race and racism as foundational to capitalism and the
maintenance of the colonial/modern world system]{.underline} (Quijano,
2000, 2007). We detail some key insights from these literatures, which
illuminate the particular work security does for racial domination and
violent dispossession. Third, and finally, in contrast to longstanding
currents in critical security studies that locate security as a source
of emancipation (Booth, 1991), we argue that security needs to be
dismantled by engaging with abolitionist thought and praxis.

Drawing on these literatures, we begin to unpack the [foundationally
raced precepts of security and offer some suggestions for critical
security research]{.underline}. We argue [that race cannot be 'tacked
on' as a qualifier but needs to be addressed as a structure that informs
how we apprehend security in the first instance. In]{.underline} doing
so, **[we locate security as a justification for violence and the
legitimation of the mechanisms through which this violence is
waged]{.underline}**. We suggest that critical [security studies needs
to reckon more seriously with how security projects and the kinds of
social orders they enact are always already racial orders **too,
predicated on the production of racialized 'Others' in need of
elimination.**]{.underline} The focus should be on interrogating how
processes [of racialization work in relation to security, along with the
structures they depend on and the ends they serve.]{.underline}
'**[Security', we argue, is the term used both to hide racial violence
and Native dispossession and annihilation and to legitimate this same
violence.]{.underline}** [Drawing on terminology from literature on the
imperial origins and raced foundations of police (Singh, 2014), we call
on critical security studies to contend with what we call the whiteness
of security.]{.underline} This can assist efforts to locate **[the
particular roles that security plays in the normalization of
group-differentiated violence]{.underline}** (Gilmore, 2002) [and the
forms of value accrued therein. Locating the whiteness of security,
however, does not imply that racial categories and their attending power
structures, sites and objects of violence are stable and totalizing --
quite the contrary]{.underline}. While we spell out some new analytical
and political avenues, there is much more to be said about how
**[security is implicated in material dispossession and race-making
beyond what we are able to detail here]{.underline}**. We propose five
starting points for apprehending the intersections of race--security.

#### Alternative -- Only abandoning the epistemic core and infrastructural framework of international relations can open a new disciplinary agenda

**Sen, Roskilde University International Development Studies Associate
Professor, 21** (Somdeep, "Colouring critical security studies: A view
from the classroom", Security Dialogue, 2021, Vol. 52(S) 133-141, EBSCO,
GDI access 7/12/22)

The question remains**[: What would a non-racist discipline look like?
It is presumptuous to think that any number of reparative pedagogical
strategies would allow us to simply escape international relations'
historically entrenched racist precepts.]{.underline}** Aijaz Ahmad
(1992: 77) once wrote that 'history is not really open to correction
through a return passage to an imaginary point, centuries ago, before
the colonial deformation set in'. Ahmad was of course referring to the
English language and the feasibility of effacing it as an integral facet
of the colonized people's identity (for further dis- cussion, see Sen,
2020b: 142-146). Without stretching this metaphor too far, I would argue
that **[international relations' racist history is not open to course
correction]{.underline}** either. But while we cannot change this
history, we can choose what to do with it.

At the outset, then, **[this requires the recognition of a foundational
dilemma,]{.underline}** namely, **[that racism is not just an aspect of
international relations: it characterizes the very nature and purpose of
the discipline]{.underline}**. **[A non-racist international relations
would thus need to position itself as not just an endeavour to add a
critical pillar within the existent white-supremacist disciplinary
structures and norms. It would need be something else
altogether.]{.underline}** For one thing, cognizant of the racialized
intel- lectual foundations of international relations as it is taught
today, **[the non-racist international rela- tions would look elsewhere
for the intellectual building blocks of a new epistemic
core]{.underline}**. To this end, it would need to draw on a
well-established (albeit ignored and marginalized) legacy of scholarship
within international relations that has deliberated the role of racism
and white supremacy in the making of the global order. However, the
purpose of this scholarly legacy in the non-racist disci- pline is
**[not to simply speak to the mainstream from the outside
in]{.underline}** or languish in the category of 'critical approaches'
that often appears at the back end of international relations curricula
and textbooks. **[Instead, in a non-racist international relations, the
works]{.underline}** of, among others, Alain Locke (\[1916\] 1992), W.
E. B. Du Bois (1903, 1915) and Merze Tate (1943, 1961), along with the
more recent scholarly engagement with questions of race and racism,2
**[would be placed at the very top of the disciplinary hierarchy as the
mainstream and recognized for their indispensable contribution to the
scholarly agenda of international relations.]{.underline}**

**[However, the racism of international relations is not just a matter
of its core intellectuality ori- entation. It is equally reflected in
the material consequences]{.underline}** of its racist precepts, evident
not least in hirings, tenure decisions and grant-giving practices.
**[All of these act as the infrastructure that keeps up the colour line
and function as a nexus of (dis)incentives that renders it
professionally unwise to critique international relations' racialized
epistemic core]{.underline}**. In contrast, in the non-racist
international relations, practitioners of the discipline would not need
to fear - as I did - the optics and consequences of critiquing
international relations' racist legacy. On the contrary, such efforts
would be deemed an extension of the core purpose of the non-racist
discipline. **[Seen together]{.underline}**, what I propose **[here is
the abandoning of international relations in its current
form]{.underline}**. **[However, theorizing 'interstate
relations']{.underline}** (Weber, 2015: 29; for further discussion, see
Wight, 1960; Cox, 1981) **[remains a worthwhile disciplinary agenda. And
the non-racist international relations can make an invalua- ble
contribution to this agenda by revealing the multiple, positioned ways
in which politics is understood and experienced.]{.underline}**

## Security Abolitionism 1NC Shell (Antiblackness)

#### The plan manifests as a political technology rooted in bourgeois values for the upholding of racialized capitalism

In locating the material foundations of security, we take our [cue from
Marxist critiques of security, which illuminate the work that security
performs for colonization and capital]{.underline}. [In contrast to
critical security studies' ambivalent position on how security serves
structures of domination]{.underline}, [Marxist approaches **locate
security in relation to liberal thought and the emergence of capitalism,
apprehending the key ideological and material roles that security plays
in accumulation**]{.underline}. Marxist [critiques of security
**de-fetishize security as 'a good thing'** -- that is**, 'some kind of
universal or transcendental** value' -- instead situating it 'as a mode
of governing]{.underline}, **[a political technology that serves to
"colonise" categories,]{.underline}** [places and spaces and through
which individuals, groups, classes, and]{.underline}, **[ultimately,
modern capital is reshaped and reordered']{.underline}** (Neocleous,
2008: 3--4, emphasis in original). This work builds directly on Mark
Neocleous's (2000: 43[) critical theorization of police power, which
situates]{.underline} **[security as 'the supreme concept of bourgeois
society', bound up with the fabrication of social order]{.underline}**.
['Fabrication', in this account, concerns how policing and security work
to produce social orders under capitalism, as well as the ideological,
euphemistic and illusory dimensions of this work.]{.underline} As
Neocleous (2016: 11) writes, '**[Security is ranged against us. But if
today the world wants to be deceived, it wants to be deceived in the
name of security.]{.underline}**' This literature has further developed
the critical concept of ['pacification' to apprehend the linkages
between historical colonial wars and contemporary security projects,
offering 'the potential to demonstrate how this history weighs on and is
often perpetuated in the present']{.underline}

Taken together, Marxist literatures offer a framework with which **[to
apprehend security's role in material accumulation by dispossession by
situating policing and security in the longue durée of empire and
capitalism.]{.underline}** Crucially, this literature also opens space
**[in which to mobilize against security's pacifying and colonizing
imperatives]{.underline}** (Pasternak and Dafnos, 2018). Indeed,
[Marxists reject security wholesale, calling it out **as a 'dangerous
illusion'**]{.underline} [that serves as a 'blockage on
politics']{.underline} **[by evacuating a focus on exploitation,
alienation and the material foundations of emancipation and spurning
complicity in the exercise of police powers]{.underline}** (Neocleous
and Rigakos, 2011: 15, emphasis in original). Thus, in contrast to
critical security studies' longstanding attempts to rehabilitate
security by deepening, broadening, humanizing and engendering it, or
otherwise making it more palatable and inclusive, Marxist accounts
radically reorientate the objectives of critical security research to
inform new repertoires of struggle around an anti-security politics.
While some of this work is widely cited within critical security
studies, its calls to foreground material considerations and reject
security per se are less reflected in the field's orientation

However, core texts within [Marxist literatures only tangentially engage
with race and racism.]{.underline} **[They thereby elide the ways in
which race-making is foundational to capitalism, empire]{.underline}**
(Quijano, 2000; Robinson, 2000) **[and, by extension,
security.]{.underline}** Recent interventions in Marxist security
thinking have begun to rectify this blind spot. **[This work
productively explores how projects of pacification and their material
dispossession take place through race-making]{.underline}** (McQuade,
2019; Schrader, 2019; Seigel, 2018; Wall, 2016). Nikhil Pal Singh (2017:
27**[) draws attention to a 'racialized narrative of security' that
emerged in the settler-colonial project of the United
States]{.underline}**, **[which 'invested every white person with the
sovereign right to kill'. Such violence, he argues, was justified as 'a
humanizing endeavor, civilizing process, and security
project']{.underline}** (Singh, 2017: 43). Eli Jelly-Schapiro (2018: 30)
stresses that **['race is both that against which society must be
secured and the means of its securing'.]{.underline}** [**Scholars**
from outside pacification and anti-security literatures echo these
claims]{.underline}, **[locating security and surveillance as distinctly
racial projects]{.underline}** (Amar, 2011; Browne, 2015; DunbarOrtiz,
2018; Kumar, 2020; Miller, 2017). In her work on Palestine/Israel,
Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian (2015) argues tha**[t Israeli 'security'
functions as a settler-colonial 'theology' that makes possible the
demonization and elimination of Palestinians through their
racialization.]{.underline}**

[These interrogations of race--security point toward two key
things]{.underline}. **[First, security projects and the kinds of social
orders they fabricate are always already racial orders predicated on the
production of racialized Others in need of differentiation and/or
elimination]{.underline}**. [Second]{.underline}, **[security works
euphemistically as a political technology fundamentally tied to
imperatives of white supremacy, which justify racialized violence as
security.]{.underline}** While highly instructive, these insights remain
theoretically underdeveloped. In order to better theorize security's
roles in race-making and white supremacy, the next section illustrates
how three key concepts (racial capitalism, coloniality of power and
racialization) can help us think through the intersections of
race-making, empire, capitalism and security more systematically.

#### Hence, security notions are founded upon the concept of the Universal Enemy and racial capitalism which make the violences of racism imperative to its existence

**[Racial differentiation and its associated forms of violent
dispossession are foundational of and intrinsic to historical
capitalism]{.underline}**, as elaborated by Cedric Robinson's (2000)
concept of '**[racial capitalism' and Aníbal Quijano's (2000) notion of
the 'coloniality of power'. Capitalism, race-making and empire must
therefore be theorized in conjunction, yet without it being assumed that
their violent structures are fixed]{.underline}**. [In unpacking the
**social construction of race and its relation to structures of power,**
critical race theory's theorizations of racialization offer additional
insights into]{.underline} **[race-making as ongoing processes involving
'the extension of racial meaning to a previously unclassified
relationship, social practice or group']{.underline}** (Omi and Winant,
2014: 111). In this framework, [race and racism are dynamic, yet guided
by certain historical prerogatives. While importantly challenging the
notion of race as based on biological essences, the racialization
framework situates race as historically evolving but also as doing
particular kinds of work.]{.underline} It is in this sense that Patrick
**[Wolfe (2016) argues that race can be understood as a 'trace of
history'. Race is deeply ideological and works performatively in the
service of empire and capital: 'rather than simply describing human
groups, \[race\] brings them into being as inter-relating social
categories with behavioural prescriptions to match]{.underline}**.
[Racialization refers to this active productivity of race]{.underline},
**[whereby colonialism refashions its human terrain']{.underline}**
(Wolfe, 2016: 10). [This dual focus on race's productivity and
dynamism]{.underline} [enables us to apprehend its continuities with
historical forms of social differentiation as well as its ever-shifting
targets and contradictions across time and space]{.underline}. Indeed,
Singh (2012: 288--289) argues that [racialization can help us to more
fully grasp 'the empty foundationalism and ceaseless reinventedness that
seems to characterize the operation of race in modernity . . . "the
changing same"']{.underline}

**[Racialization addresses how racism functions to racialize and oppress
certain populations, and how the vulnerabilities and forms of protection
produced by racism work in governing]{.underline}**. As Singh (2012:
284--285) proposes, [to answer the vexing question**, What is
racism?**]{.underline} [one needs to begin not by identifying a set of
preexisting, already categorized groups that are done to]{.underline},
[but rather by delineating the formation and institutionalization of
structures and situations of protection and vulnerability for which post
hoc, descriptive accounts of dishonored group characteristics serve as a
form of rationalization or justification]{.underline}.

A focus on racialization or 'race in action' thus allows us to
**[address precursors of formal racial doctrine and apprehend how
various 'racializing practices' attempt to preserve population-centric
modes of colonial domination over time through racism]{.underline}**
(Wolfe, 2016: 10). **[Racism is produced through histories and
structures, but also through a particular kind of violence, including
the violence of demarcation.]{.underline}** As Ruth Wilson Gilmore puts
it, **[although 'race has no essence, racism does. Racism is singular
because, whatever its place-based particularities, its practitioners
renew fatal power-difference couplings']{.underline}** (Gilmore, 2002:
16, emphasis in original). This approach to **[racism locates the
fatalities it produces -- that is, 'premature deaths' -- as constitutive
of contemporary political power and subjectivitie]{.underline}**s. As
Gilmore (2002: 16) continues, **['racism is a practice of abstraction, a
death-dealing displacement of difference into hierarchies that organize
relations within and between the planet's sovereign political
territories']{.underline}**. Following Singh and Gilmore, Stuart
Schrader

(2019: 39--41) similarly explains: '**[Race is not racism's
predetermined object; it is what racism produces. . . . Racism produces
the benefit from state projects of race-making' -- that is,
whiteness]{.underline}**. In other words**[, race produces racism
through racialization]{.underline}**, **[which in turn accrues
particular material benefits to certain groups in the form of whiteness,
through its denial to others]{.underline}**. **[This enables identity
and 'community' formation around racial hatred and the shared defence of
whiteness]{.underline}** (Ahmed, 2004: 118) **[and strategies to
eliminate Blackness.]{.underline}** **[Racism thereby (re)produces and
naturalizes racial hierarchies as 'commonsense' markers of global
difference and knowledge production]{.underline}** (Quijano, 2000,
2007).

Bringing this literature [on racialization together with critical
concepts of racial capitalism and the coloniality of power provides an
analytical framework for critically apprehending and situating race in
the study of security.]{.underline} [Rather than taking racial
categories and their power structures, sites and objects for granted,
these structural accounts of race and racism ask us to
address]{.underline}: (1) **[what are the structural drivers of
race-making, (2) how does racialization takes place across time and
space, and (3) with what effects]{.underline}**. Posing such questions
is crucial for any critical interrogations of race--security going
forward, offering opportunities to further Marxist theorizations of
security. For instance, if we read Neocleous's (2016) [The Universal
Adversary through the lenses of racial capitalism, the coloniality of
power and racialization]{.underline}, it becomes visible how **[the
enemies that animate security projects are constituted through
structures of race]{.underline}**. Neocleous situates t**[he 'Universal
Adversary' as the central figure against which security has been
organized from its inception in liberal thought. 'Bourgeois modernity',
Neocleous argues, 'is oriented around the imagination of an
Enemy]{.underline}**. This is so because **[the fear of some kind of
Enemy is a fundamental feature of the supreme concept of bourgeois
society: security']{.underline}** (Neocleous, 2016: 1, emphasis added).
While The Universal Adversary is limited by its lack of direct attention
to race, Neocleous's account bears striking resemblance to Singh's
(2012: 288--289) references to [the 'empty foundationalism' and
'ceaseless reinventedness' of race in modernity. Neocleous (2016: 4)
argues that the Universal Enemy's 'ghostly emptiness' is a central
defining]{.underline} [feature, leaving the 'category of the Enemy open
to endless modification']{.underline}, thereby [providing the 'power to
pronounce on what the Enemy is, where it can be found and how it
behave]{.underline}s'.

We suggest that these similarities are not incidental and provide good
reasons to suspect that **[the Universal Enemy cannot be understood
outside of race-making]{.underline}**.1 **[The Enemy is a figure that
does work in organizing security in bourgeois society not merely as some
kind of other but as a racial Other.]{.underline}** This is illustrated
by Darryl Li's (2019) path-breaking **[The Universal Enemy, which aptly
demonstrates how logics and practices of war, violence and
dispossession, as well as struggles for justice against empire, are
animated by racialization]{.underline}**. Li shows [that **the
universalist aspirations of these projects work with and through the
production of differences, including racial difference that are in
processes of reformation.**]{.underline}

#### Thus we affirm abolitionist praxis and anti-security- Only by looking beyond the formations of violence under racial capitalism can we undo structures of race which constitute security logics

[Implicit in our discussion are questions about how to articulate a more
radical and anti-racist agenda in critical security
studies]{.underline}. Here, the [Marxist anti-security ethos lays
crucial groundwork by]{.underline} **[rejecting security and opening
spaces in which to 'fight for an alternative language that takes us
beyond the narrow horizon of bourgeois security and its police
powers']{.underline}** (Neocleous and Rigakos, 2011: 21). [This
imperative dovetails with core strands of abolitionist
thinking]{.underline}. Brendan McQuade (2018: 5) argues that **[pairing
abolitionist traditions with Marxist critiques of security is
politically and analytically productive: 'Abolition is the foil of
bourgeoisie security]{.underline}**. **[Where security discourses are
concerned with fabrication of capitalist forms of social order,
abolition is a way of thinking about producing social order outside of
the logic of capital and private property, state violence, and
racialized subjectivity.]{.underline}**' We agree.

**[From the outset, abolitionist thought and praxis have apprehended
capitalism, race-making, empire and violence as conjoined and developed
strategies to fight them accordingly]{.underline}**. **[Abolitionist
thinking rejects liberal reformist paradigms of trying to make carceral
and policing institutions more humane, recognizing that the racialized
domination these institutions mete out serves structural
imperatives]{.underline}** (Gilmore, 2007). **[The violence of the
carceral state cannot be abstracted from other aspects of domination
under capitalism and empire]{.underline}**. The central 'challenge' of
abolitionist thinking, Gilmore (2017: 228) writes, 'is to keep the
entirety of carceral geographies -- rather than only their prison or
even law-enforcement aspects -- connected, without collapsing or
reducing various aspects into each other'**[. While contending with how
capitalism works in conjunction with race-making, abolitionism refuses
to reify carceral structures' totalizing pretences, in part by
challenging their self-implied necessity, desirability and economic
efficiency. Abolitionist thinkers centre how structures of racialized
violence are both reproduced and disrupted by human
interaction]{.underline}**. As Gilmore (2017: 238) stresses, '[abolition
geography takes feeling and agency to be constitutive of, no less than
constrained by, structure']{.underline}. Indeed, one of Gilmore's most
important contributions is [to foreground the 'flesh-and-blood
perspective on incarceration and the unexpected alliances that might be
forged in the face of dispossessed isolation]{.underline}' (McKittrick,
2011: 958)

**[Abolitionist work is concerned with developing strategies to
dismantle carceral technologies and their geographies]{.underline}**.
**[It does so by establishing community networks outside of the
racialized hierarchies that underpin capitalism and empire, providing
concrete strategies for redirecting resources for policing, prisons and
war towards developing more humane and liberated ways of
living]{.underline}** (McQuade, 2018: 4). [Abolitionist praxis emerges
from the inspiration and strategies of the flight and fugitivity of
maroon communities that escaped slavery, established new communities and
organized to upend the structures of slavery]{.underline} (Du Bois,
\[1935\] 2017). **[It recovers the histories of 'community building,
where the terror and violence of racial capitalism and white supremacy
were temporarily suspended, free men and women negotiated their own
terms of living, and, in the process, negated the terms of
order']{.underline}** (Quan, 2017: 174--175). **[Abolitionist thought
and praxis thereby provide visions beyond racial capitalism and the
group-differentiated violence it reproduces]{.underline}**.

**[We argue that traditions of abolitionism offer conceptual and
practical strategies for undoing the structures of race that animate
security projects by providing models for ungovernability]{.underline}**
(Quan, 2017**[), both the existence of a consciousness outside of

In locating the material foundations of security, we take our [cue from
Marxist critiques of security, which illuminate the work that security
performs for colonization and capital]{.underline}. [In contrast to
critical security studies' ambivalent position on how security serves
structures of domination]{.underline}, [Marxist approaches **locate
security in relation to liberal thought and the emergence of capitalism,
apprehending the key ideological and material roles that security plays
in accumulation**]{.underline}. Marxist [critiques of security
**de-fetishize security as 'a good thing'** -- that is**, 'some kind of
universal or transcendental** value' -- instead situating it 'as a mode
of governing]{.underline}, **[a political technology that serves to
"colonise" categories,]{.underline}** [places and spaces and through
which individuals, groups, classes, and]{.underline}, **[ultimately,
modern capital is reshaped and reordered']{.underline}** (Neocleous,
2008: 3--4, emphasis in original). This work builds directly on Mark
Neocleous's (2000: 43[) critical theorization of police power, which
situates]{.underline} **[security as 'the supreme concept of bourgeois
society', bound up with the fabrication of social order]{.underline}**.
['Fabrication', in this account, concerns how policing and security work
to produce social orders under capitalism, as well as the ideological,
euphemistic and illusory dimensions of this work.]{.underline} As
Neocleous (2016: 11) writes, '**[Security is ranged against us. But if
today the world wants to be deceived, it wants to be deceived in the
name of security.]{.underline}**' This literature has further developed
the critical concept of ['pacification' to apprehend the linkages
between historical colonial wars and contemporary security projects,
offering 'the potential to demonstrate how this history weighs on and is
often perpetuated in the present']{.underline}

Taken together, Marxist literatures offer a framework with which **[to
apprehend security's role in material accumulation by dispossession by
situating policing and security in the longue durée of empire and
capitalism.]{.underline}** Crucially, this literature also opens space
**[in which to mobilize against security's pacifying and colonizing
imperatives]{.underline}** (Pasternak and Dafnos, 2018). Indeed,
[Marxists reject security wholesale, calling it out **as a 'dangerous
illusion'**]{.underline} [that serves as a 'blockage on
politics']{.underline} **[by evacuating a focus on exploitation,
alienation and the material foundations of emancipation and spurning
complicity in the exercise of police powers]{.underline}** (Neocleous
and Rigakos, 2011: 15, emphasis in original). Thus, in contrast to
critical security studies' longstanding attempts to rehabilitate
security by deepening, broadening, humanizing and engendering it, or
otherwise making it more palatable and inclusive, Marxist accounts
radically reorientate the objectives of critical security research to
inform new repertoires of struggle around an anti-security politics.
While some of this work is widely cited within critical security
studies, its calls to foreground material considerations and reject
security per se are less reflected in the field's orientation

However, core texts within [Marxist literatures only tangentially engage
with race and racism.]{.underline} **[They thereby elide the ways in
which race-making is foundational to capitalism, empire]{.underline}**
(Quijano, 2000; Robinson, 2000) **[and, by extension,
security.]{.underline}** Recent interventions in Marxist security
thinking have begun to rectify this blind spot. **[This work
productively explores how projects of pacification and their material
dispossession take place through race-making]{.underline}** (McQuade,
2019; Schrader, 2019; Seigel, 2018; Wall, 2016). Nikhil Pal Singh (2017:
27**[) draws attention to a 'racialized narrative of security' that
emerged in the settler-colonial project of the United
States]{.underline}**, **[which 'invested every white person with the
sovereign right to kill'. Such violence, he argues, was justified as 'a
humanizing endeavor, civilizing process, and security
project']{.underline}** (Singh, 2017: 43). Eli Jelly-Schapiro (2018: 30)
stresses that **['race is both that against which society must be
secured and the means of its securing'.]{.underline}** [**Scholars**
from outside pacification and anti-security literatures echo these
claims]{.underline}, **[locating security and surveillance as distinctly
racial projects]{.underline}** (Amar, 2011; Browne, 2015; DunbarOrtiz,
2018; Kumar, 2020; Miller, 2017). In her work on Palestine/Israel,
Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian (2015) argues tha**[t Israeli 'security'
functions as a settler-colonial 'theology' that makes possible the
demonization and elimination of Palestinians through their
racialization.]{.underline}**

[These interrogations of race--security point toward two key
things]{.underline}. **[First, security projects and the kinds of social
orders they fabricate are always already racial orders predicated on the
production of racialized Others in need of differentiation and/or
elimination]{.underline}**. [Second]{.underline}, **[security works
euphemistically as a political technology fundamentally tied to
imperatives of white supremacy, which justify racialized violence as
security.]{.underline}** While highly instructive, these insights remain
theoretically underdeveloped. In order to better theorize security's
roles in race-making and white supremacy, the next section illustrates
how three key concepts (racial capitalism, coloniality of power and
racialization) can help us think through the intersections of
race-making, empire, capitalism and security more systematically.

**[Today we know that 'security' is just another word for extinction and
genocide.]{.underline}** **[Every discourse of securing implies that
there is a ground to be secured, a 'home', a way of being that is
threatened or that requires saving, sustaining and being located within
a temporality and spatiality]{.underline}**. **[It is precisely this
security that is denied in an anti-Black world]{.underline}**. As
Saidiya Hartman argues, **[only recognized subjects have something to
secure; for others, 'home' is an impossibility: 'We stay there, but we
don't live there]{.underline}**' (Hartman, 2007: 87). As has already
been stated, **[every ground of this discourse is built on
anti-Blackness]{.underline}**. [However inclusive the space that is

Security Dialogue's call comes out of a wider move to include race in
discussions of international relations, amid calls to 'decolonize' a
discipline that has always been at the heart of colonial power
structures [(]{.underline}Sabaratnam, 2017). Yet, [in order to
understand what is at stake in this move to include race in a discipline
that formerly seemed to ignore it]{.underline}, **[we must consider the
relationship between Blackness and the world, the ontological condition
that makes anti-Blackness inextricable from secur]{.underline}**ity. In
short**[, we must realize that questions of race and racism have always
been the ground that critical security studies stands on]{.underline}**

[The idea that racism can be isolated and extracted from an academic
discipline while its effects are therapeutically addressed is challenged
by the weight of Afropessimist scholarship, critical Black feminist and
anti-colonial thinking]{.underline}. [**The urge to 'decolonize'
academia suggests that coloniality is a condition that can be uprooted
within the university without addressing the broader antiBlack world
that universities are in.** Some prominent decolonial scholars have
challengingly argued that 'decolonization is not a
metaphor]{.underline}' (Tuck and Yang, 2012), [and others have suggested
the need for pluriversal approaches to security that allow for inclusion
of a multitude of nonWestern ontologies]{.underline} (Escobar, 2018).
**[However, even pluriversal approaches risk retaining parts of the
edifice of modernity without addressing its anti-Black foundations,
leaving open the possibility of 're-enchanting and pluralising
\[international relations]{.underline}**\]' (Rothe, 2019: 9),
**[assuming that redemption and reparation is possible]{.underline}**.
[The temporality at stake is that which seeks to salvage 'critique'
through an imaginary telos of progress -- learning the lessons and
moving onwards, ever opening and exploring new avenues and new
approaches -- hence the appeal to an ethico-political 'openness' that
the making of reparative politics is held to enable]{.underline}.
**[This attempt to move 'beyond' the problem of 'the spectres of race
and racism' is laudable but, we argue, misguided]{.underline}**. **[It
is precisely critical narratives of 'progress' that critical Black
studies and Afropessimism seek to problematize]{.underline}** (Ray et
al., 2017).

**[Rather than considering anti-Blackness as an epiphenomenon of
modernity, a glitch in our system that needs to be fixed, it may be
understood as constitutive of a modern ontology]{.underline}**
(Wilderson, 2010). As Nahum Dimitri Chandler (2014: 130) states,
**['there is no contemporary discourse that is free or independent of
the itinerary of the concept of race'. The existence of Blackness is
ontologically crucial in providing the boundaries of humanity, in
creating the Outside, the Other, that is necessary to define the inside
of modernity, civil society and human subjectivity]{.underline}**
(Warren, 2018). As Saidiya Hartman (2017: 33) argues, '**[the texture of
freedom is laden with the vestiges of slavery, and abstract equality is
utterly enmeshed in the narrative of black subjection']{.underline}**.
Thus, f[or Afropessimists, **it is not merely the contemporary order of
humanity that is enmeshed with antiBlackness, but also the struggles for
emancipation by those within that order**]{.underline}. [This does not
mean that there is no oppression among those who are recognized as
human,]{.underline} [but that their struggles for freedom within this
space are of a different order from that of Black people, as the space
of these internal conflicts is constituted by
anti-Blackness]{.underline}. **[In order for there to be security for
humanity, in order for the liberal subject, civil society and a world of
progress to function, Blackness must remain outside, as the counterpoint
to the telos of modernity.]{.underline}**

**[This throws into question calls for inclusion, for justice and for
reparation, as well as the ability for the global system to be
accountable for the suffering and death of Black people]{.underline}**.
**[If anti-Blackness is a structural necessity for the system to exist,
then there can be no justice, no end to violence against Black people if
the current system persists.]{.underline}** **[The drive to include
Black people in civil society,]{.underline}** [to promote
multiculturalism, diversity and inclusion**, leaves untouched the
ontological condition of Blackness, which is required to maintain the
borders of humanity**]{.underline}. [The radical force of Black
liberation movements was blunted by the drive to assimilate them, to
include Black people in the political sphere, to recognize and celebrate
their 'ethnic identity', without addressing the fundamental condition of
Blackness]{.underline}. In the USA**[, anti-Black violence remains a
necessity to maintain security, despite the inclusion of Black people at
all levels of government]{.underline}**. **[Inclusivity does not
ameliorate the problem; it merely obfuscates it]{.underline}**. As Frank
Wilderson (2010: 103) argues, '**[few characters aestheticize White
supremacy more effectively and persuasively than a Black male
cop]{.underline}**'. **[American governance is not 'haunted' by race, it
is constituted through race.]{.underline}**

[Thus the line between humanity and Blackness is not shattered through
the inclusion of some Black people in the space of civil society;
rather, it is reinforced]{.underline}. In [South Africa, the Black
inhabitants of townships continue to endure state violence and poverty
despite the formal end of apartheid]{.underline}. [Black activists now
protest against their government by 'black boers' (settlers), those who
have crossed the line into humanity only to fortify it against their
former compatriot]{.underline}s (Madlingozi, 2017). This is because, as
Tsepho Madlingozi (2017: 14) argues, **['the main edifice of the
ontological structure of colonial-apartheid . . . remains in place'. In
order to ensure the security of settler society, those few who have been
inducted into it must maintain the violence of the anti-Black order that
is said to be overturned.]{.underline}**

**[Security, then, is sustained through anti-Blackness, for if the
abject non-subject of the Black experience does not exist as a point of
contrast, then humanity cannot be safe. The subjectivity of the
(non-Black) human is imperilled, without the safety of anti-Black
violence that ensures its ontological integrity.]{.underline}** If this
is the case, [then we must re-read the call to bring considerations of
race and racism into critical security studies and question the
feasibility of achieving an ethico-political reparation in a discipline
that relies on the structure of an anti-Black system]{.underline}.

#### Security discourse and the eurocentrist project of the affirmative is rooted in anti-Black racism

hooch//cs)

Second, securitization theory's Eurocentrism has been challenged by
scholarship that asks whether applying securitization theory to the
non-West upends or modifies the theory (Bilgin, 2010, 2011; Wilkinson,
2007), a question echoed by some of securitization theory's original
proponents (see Greenwood and Wæver, 2013). However, securitization
theory has never ignored the 'non-West'. As we will show, it draws
heavily on racist accounts of spaces outside Europe that reify a stark
division between 'West' and 'non-West' without examining colonial
relationalities. Critics of securitization theory's Eurocentrism assert
that we cannot assume a (functioning, democratic) European state in
non-West spaces, but ignore the (settler-)colonial underpinnings of the
state system and border cartographies. Seeing the issue solely as the
analytical exclusion of the 'non-West', they decry 'Eurocentrism' while
retaining racist political thought. We adopt a more robust analysis (see
Sabaratnam, 2013) that views Eurocentrism as involving the ideas that:
(1) 'Europe' or 'the West' is ontologically distinctive; (2) European
development was endogenous; and (3) European cultural and political
achievements were subsequently diffused across the world. Additionally,
we deploy concepts beyond Eurocentrism (civilizationism, methodological
whiteness, and antiblack racism) to grapple with the role of racist
political thought in securitization theory.

Third, an emerging body of scholarship has moved significantly beyond a
thin interpretation of Eurocentrism to inquire into how securitization
theory can better account for colonialism (Bertrand, 2018) and racism
(Amin-Khan, 2012; Ibrahim, 2005; Mofette and Vadasaria, 2016). This work
has highlighted how 'securitizations' are animated by racialized threat
imaginaries (Ibrahim, 2005; Mofette and Vadasaria, 2016). At times, work
in this field acknowledges that securitization theory relies on a
norm/exception binary that risks minimizing the racial violence of
normal (liberal) politics. However, the retention of securitization
theory's methodology means the focus remains on speech acts. This risks
limiting our understanding of racism and colonialism to a matter merely
of (racist) language. For example, in examining migration, the
literature on race and securitization focuses primarily on politicians
or other authoritative speakers framing migrants as security threats.
What then tends to fall out of view is how the control of the movement
of racialized people has been and continues to be constitutive of the
'normal' liberal order (Gutiérrez Rodríguez, 2018). Even when a
historical approach is taken, the focus is on historical instances of
speech acts or the 'securitization' of migration, instead of, for
example, the impacts of colonial drawing of borders or ongoing
settler-colonial occupation. Merely 'adding' race to securitization
theory is insufficient to account for the raciality and coloniality of
global politics. By instead excavating the fundamental racism of
securitization theory's concepts and methods, and its reliance on an
eclectic canon of racist political thought, we can more fully explore
the operations of racialization in security theory and practice.

### AT: No Link/Link of Omission -- "Security" 

#### Link of Commission -- "security" cannot be disentangled from racial violence - The security logics of the plan are intrinsically rooted in white supremacy

**Machold, University of Glasgow Lecturer in International Relations in
Politics and Charrett**, **University of Westminster Senior Lecturer in
Global Politics, 21**  (Rhys and Catherine, 2021, Security Dialogue2021,
Vol. 52(S) 38--48, \"Beyond ambivalence: Locating thewhiteness of

pages 7-8 accessed on 7-8-2022 hooch//cs)

Answering this question requires taking stock of how critical security
studies' orientation to security squares with wider questions concerning
power and structure in global politics. In developing non-traditional
approaches to security, critical security studies has cultivated an
important critical distance from state security and (neo)realist
accounts of war-making as security. Guided by an imperative to decentre
material relationships, however[, critical security studies has embraced
a commitment to open-ended and ambivalent accounts of power, which
unmoor security from histories and structures (Barkawi, 2011). As a
result, critical security studies broadly (and its poststructuralist
variants in particular) 'fail\[s\] . . . to adequately situate security
within complex entanglements with other technologies of
power']{.underline} (Coleman and Rosenow, 2016: 203). [This tendency to
abstract security from wider power configurations, we suggest, has
largely precluded critical approaches to security from apprehending
racism as a structural form of power in global politics that serves
capital and colonial prerogatives -- albeit with notable
exceptions]{.underline} (e.g. AbuBakare, 2020; Ali, 2020; Axster et al.,
2021; Eastwood, 2019; Manchanda and Rossdale, 2021). **[This poses a
specific problem for any critical engagement of racism in relation to
security: Racism only makes sense as a form of power and technology of
governing insofar as it does specific kinds of work, namely,
(re)producing differences and hierarchies in the service of capital and
empire]{.underline}**. **[To imply that 'security' can be bracketed off
from and thereby detached from its imbrication in long histories of
race-making, capitalism and empire]{.underline}** (Jelly-Schapiro, 2018;
Singh, 2017) **[is naïve, untenable and complicit in the (re)production
of structural white supremacy.]{.underline}**

As a corrective to these tendencies, we suggest that [security needs to
be apprehended as a concept, a set of power relations and governing
regimes]{.underline} **[that are dynamic but do specific work for
capital, colonization and, hence, race-making.]{.underline}** To this
end, we call for a closer engagement with three sets of literature.
First, we argue that [Marxist critiques of security and pacification
theory can help locate security materially within ongoing histories of
imperial, colonial and capitalist domination. Yet, while these
theorizations of security crucially foreground material and ideological
considerations, their core texts engage only tangentially with questions
of race and racism]{.underline}. Thus, second, we suggest that [critical
security studies needs to engage with theoretical traditions that
situate race and racism as foundational to capitalism and the
maintenance of the colonial/modern world system]{.underline} (Quijano,
2000, 2007). We detail some key insights from these literatures, which
illuminate the particular work security does for racial domination and
violent dispossession. Third, and finally, in contrast to longstanding
currents in critical security studies that locate security as a source
of emancipation (Booth, 1991), we argue that security needs to be
dismantled by engaging with abolitionist thought and praxis.

Drawing on these literatures, we begin to unpack the [foundationally
raced precepts of security and offer some suggestions for critical
security research]{.underline}. We argue [that race cannot be 'tacked
on' as a qualifier but needs to be addressed as a structure that informs
how we apprehend security in the first instance. In]{.underline} doing
so, **[we locate security as a justification for violence and the
legitimation of the mechanisms through which this violence is
waged]{.underline}**. We suggest that critical [security studies needs
to reckon more seriously with how security projects and the kinds of
social orders they enact are always already racial orders **too,
predicated on the production of racialized 'Others' in need of
elimination.**]{.underline} The focus should be on interrogating how
processes [of racialization work in relation to security, along with the
structures they depend on and the ends they serve.]{.underline}
'**[Security', we argue, is the term used both to hide racial violence
and Native dispossession and annihilation and to legitimate this same
violence.]{.underline}** [Drawing on terminology from literature on the
imperial origins and raced foundations of police (Singh, 2014), we call
on critical security studies to contend with what we call the whiteness
of security.]{.underline} This can assist efforts to locate **[the
particular roles that security plays in the normalization of
group-differentiated violence]{.underline}** (Gilmore, 2002) [and the
forms of value accrued therein. Locating the whiteness of security,
however, does not imply that racial categories and their attending power
structures, sites and objects of violence are stable and totalizing --
quite the contrary]{.underline}. While we spell out some new analytical
and political avenues, there is much more to be said about how
**[security is implicated in material dispossession and race-making
beyond what we are able to detail here]{.underline}**. We propose five
starting points for apprehending the intersections of race--security.

"uncivilized." And their use is racist]{.underline}**: [These invented

**[While realism and liberalism were built on Eurocentrism and used to
justify white imperialism,]{.underline}** [this fact is not widely
acknowledged in the field.]{.underline} For instance, [**according to
neorealists, there exists a "balance of power" between and among "great
powers." Most of these great powers are, not incidentally,
white-majority states, and they sit atop the hierarchy, with small and
notably less-white powers organized below them**. In a similar vein,
raced hierarchies and conceptions of control ground the concept of
cooperation in neoliberal thought: Major powers own the proverbial
table, set the chairs, and arrange the place settings.]{.underline}

[Constructivism, which rounds out the "big three" approaches, is perhaps
best positioned to tackle race and racism. Constructivists reject the
as-given condition of anarchy and maintain that anarchy, security, and
other concerns are socially constructed based on shared ideas,
histories, and experiences. **Yet with few notable exceptions,
constructivists rarely acknowledge how race shapes what is

ritorialised models of empire, in which **race is affectively modulated
across** media environments]{.underline},
**[biotechnologies]{.underline}** **[and war apparatuses]{.underline}**.
From this vantage point, [the engagement of race and control charts.a
different path for critical race theory than do the largely polemical
critiques by some Deleuzeans of the structuralism and
representationalism of racial formation theory.]{.underline} [The
intersection of race and control poses questions of whether and how
contemporary forms of empire are able to take hold of race's plastic
potential for differentiation.]{.underline}

'[The horror of control emerges not in the active attempt of a
commanding operator to overcome resistance, but in the dream of a total
realisation of the 'operator's control. At that point control itself
vanishes]{.underline}. In William Burroughs' 1978 essay "The Limits of
Control'[, the capability of the state to exercise control over a
population is presented as inherently limited by the agency of subjects
who potentially resist the control order.]{.underline} However, t[he
imagined realisation of control also marks control's vanishing point, as
the transformation of a responding subject into an object of domination
also marks its release from a dynamic of control into one of mere use**:
Control also needs opposition or acquiescence; otherwise it ceases to be
control \... I control a slave, a dog, a worker; but if I establish com-
plete control somehow, as by implanting electrodes in the brain, then my
subject is little more than a tape recorder, a camera, a robot, You
don't control a tape recorder --- you use it**]{.underline} .. . [All
control systems try to make control as tight as possible, but at the
same time, if they succeeded completely, there would be nothing left to
control, Suppose for example]{.underline} **[a control system installed
electrodes in the brains of all prospective workers at
birth,]{.underline}** **[Control is now complete]{.underline}**. **[Even
the thought of rebellion is neurologically impossible, No police force
is necessary. No psycho- logical control is necessary, other than
pushing buttons]{.underline}**, (Burroughs 1978: 38)

[Securitization theory has unquestionably made a significant impact. Its
founding texts are among the most widely cited international relations
scholarship]{.underline} (see Buzan and Wæver, 2003; Buzan et al., 1998;
Wæver, 1995; Wæver et al., 1993), [spawning active research programs and
new 'generations' of securitization theory]{.underline}. The concept of
**[securitization has travelled to disciplines beyond international
relations, and even entered public discourse]{.underline}**. What is so
appealing about this theory? Perhaps the most tempting aspect **[of
securitization theory]{.underline}** [is its methodological
rigor.]{.underline} **[It provides a clear set of steps and standards
for identifying how referent objects (e.g. migration, health,
cyberspace) become security problems and deciding whether they should
indeed be 'securitized']{.underline}**. [This readymade methodology can
be applied to all sorts of empirical areas.]{.underline} However,
students and scholars of security ought to resist this temptation of a
readymade approach and inquire more deeply into securitization theory's
core theoretical assumptions and methodology

This article argues [**that racist thought is fundamental and integral
to classic securitization theory's conceptual and methodological
project**. While other scholarship has worked either to incorporate
analysis of race into securitization theory]{.underline} (Amin-Khan,
2012; Ibrahim, 2005; Mofette and Vadasaria, 2016[) or to overcome
securitization theory's Eurocentrism]{.underline} (Bilgin, 2010, 2011;
Wilkinson, 2007), this article offers something different. It is the
first to excavate the foundations of securitization theory in racist
thought**[. We demonstrate that classic securitization theory is
fundamentally and inextricably structured not only by Eurocentrism but
also by civilizationism, methodological whiteness, and antiblack
racism]{.underline}**

What does it mean to excavate the racist foundations of a theory[? That
we use the 'r-word' and white supremacy as categories of analysis is
sure to raise eyebrows]{.underline}. Even sympathetic readers might
wonder if the problem we identify is more appropriately characterized as
Eurocentrism. [Critique of the Eurocentric character of much Western
scholarship and cultural production has made significant inroads across
academic disciplines, including international relations]{.underline}
(Hobson, 2012; Sabaratnam, 2013). Our analysis is inspired by this
research and extends some of its insights. Yet there is more to be said.
**[Black studies and decolonial scholarship demonstrate that much
orthodox and critical Western social and political thought is predicated
upon epistemological and ontological premises that are not simply
Eurocentric but racist, specifically white supremacist]{.underline}**.
**[In international relations, recent debates have addressed the
question of whether postcolonial international relations should proceed
solely through an analytic of Eurocentrism or whether we need to more
specifically address racism and white supremacism]{.underline}**
(Gruffydd Jones, 2016; Hozić, 2016; Rutazibwa, 2016; Sajed, 2016). Sajed
(2016: 168) suggests that **[the term 'Eurocentric' potentially
neutralizes the foundational and continuing racism of the
discipline]{.underline}**. Rutazibwa (2016: 192) asks, '**[what existing
power structure does this reluctance \[to name racism\]
serve?']{.underline}**

Echoing these concerns, we ask: What is at stake in the reluctance to
name racism in analyses of international security? **[Racism is a
fundamental system of power that has profoundly shaped the world for the
past several hundred years. Moreover, as is now well established,
international relations emerged to provide intellectual support for the
imperial and (settler-)colonial ambitions of Western
states]{.underline}** (Agathangelou and Ling, 2004a; Krishna, 2001;
Vitalis, 2000, 2015). Drawing on black studies, indigenous studies, and
decolonial scholarship, we illustrate **[the racist modes of thought
that underpin classic securitization theory by deploying three concepts
beyond Eurocentrism: civilizationism, methodological whiteness, and
antiblack racism]{.underline}**

### Link - Disinformation

#### 

#### Strategic appeals to combating disinformation that don't account for identity propaganda are premised on pre-existing hierarchies that underlie social orders and reaffirm marginalizing structures of power.

[Identity propaganda exploits social orders as communication
strategically designed to undermine or manipulate target populations in
pursuance of a political goal through appeals about identity or
identities that accord with racial and other power
structures.]{.underline} [By "identity," we mean]{.underline} broadly
[the understanding that individuals and groups have of who they are
fundamentally in relation to others and in relation to systems of
power]{.underline} (Combahee River Collective Statement, 1977; Lorde,
1984). [Identity is premised on social differences and hierarchies.
People, along with organizations and institutions, draw forms of
distinction and boundaries between self and others and groups, including
to advocate for or safeguard political interests.]{.underline} For
example, as Cheryl Harris (1993) observes, [white racial identity
emerges as an exclusionary and contingent property where systems of
racial classification operate in ways to protect power.]{.underline}
[Actively constructed over time, identity categories can dynamically and
flexibly shift and evolve and, as such, are not simply static
constants]{.underline} (Nash, 2008). However, [identities can also
become historically enduring social facts through persistent stories,
symbols, rituals, and institutions, such as legal
categories]{.underline} (Browne, 2015; Harris, 1993). At the same time,
[individuals possess many overlapping identities---racial and ethnic,
citizenship, geographic, religion, partisan, and so on---that can be
made salient for political affiliations and alignments.]{.underline}
Indeed, the communicative construction of identities and process of
making them politically and collectively salient as the basis of
symbolic and social action is a central aspect of political leadership,
social movements, and public life more broadly (Daniels, 2009; Jackson,
2016; Kido Lopez, 2016; Kreiss et al., 2020; Peck, 2019; Polletta and
Jasper, 2001).

**[Actors strategically use identity propaganda to construct, make
salient, or undermine aspects of identities in accord with larger
structures of power]{.underline}**---for example, [**white supremacy,
heteronormativity, or patriarchy**.]{.underline} Many [Black feminist
scholars have pointed out the simultaneity of multiple structures of
domination]{.underline} (Collins, 2009; Crenshaw, 1989; Davis, 1981;
Lorde, 1984). [Social hierarchies are organized through a "matrix of
domination]{.underline}" (Collins, 2009) [where intersecting oppressions
structure agency and autonomy for individuals and groups.]{.underline}
As a theory and method, intersectionality analyzes how different
structures of domination connect and emerge through social processes
(Nash, 2008). [Examining identity propaganda through an intersectional
lens reveals how **strategic appeals are premised on pre-existing
hierarchies that underlie national, regional, and global social
orders**.]{.underline} Various scholars have characterized these
long-standing (and normalized) relations of domination and subordination
in different ways (Du Bois, 1903; Hesse, 2016; Quijano, 2000; Said,
1978; Wynter, 2003). [In accounting for cross-cutting structures of
class, gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity within social orders,
identity propaganda works to reveal how symbolic articulations of power
are structured by and shape political relations.]{.underline} In
addition, [our conceptualization of **identity propaganda historicizes
the problem of disinformation** as one that far predates the 2016
elections by also drawing attention to the ways it unfolds through
campaigns or sets of appeals that have underlying logics and
forms.]{.underline}

[As with essentializing narratives, strategic campaigns and appeals that
contest the authenticity of an individual's or group's identity are
difficult to analyze under the standard umbrella of mis- or
disinformation because they often lack a factual basis]{.underline},
[referring more to normative constructions of difference.]{.underline}
[The authenticity of someone's claim to racial and ethnic identity
(particularly in the case of a multiracial person) or gender identity is
subjective and layered, and cannot be assessed as true or
false.]{.underline} [Authenticating narratives reduce identity back down
to the individual, drawing attention away from structural formations of
power, whereas individual people, regardless of identity, may still
align with dominant interests and the preservation of existing
hierarchies of power.]{.underline} An identity propaganda framework
enables researchers to examine these claims through the lens of both
historical race relations and constructions, as well as structures of
power behind these appeals

[Racism is the oil in the system of colonial power that makes a
sustained discrimination of and violence against certain people not only
possible but also invisible and acceptable]{.underline}. (Rutazibwa,
2016: 196, emphasis added) T[he world is undeniably in trouble. Crises
and corollary insecurities are legible everywhere, marked by
environmental degradation, healthcare panics, stark inequalities,
militarized conflicts, and the rise of authoritarian movements and
virulent alt-right populisms.]{.underline} That racism figures in
producing and structuring these entwined crises is widely recognized,
and, given its disciplinary remit, international relations is best
positioned to examine 'the link between race as a structuring principle
and the transnational processes of accumulation, dispossession, violence
and struggle that emerge in its wake' (Anievas et al., 2015: 9). **[Yet
international relations' problematic engagement with race is now
well-documented, including the discipline's 'origin' as an imperial
racist project]{.underline}** (Vitalis, 2015), **[the 'willful amnesia'
that this encouraged (Krishna, 2001: 401), and the legacy of 'racist
epistemological assumptions that inform much of contemporary mainstream
and even critical analyses of world politics']{.underline}** (Sajed,
2016a: 168; see also Grovogui, 1996; Hobson, 2012; Gruffydd Jones,
2016). Revisiting points made in his 1997 book, Charles [Mills (2015b:
542) concludes that 'the racial contract is very much alive and well . .
. and the "epistemology of ignorance" that now guards it is as active as
ever'.]{.underline}

But the problem is larger. **[Despite abundant evidence of
institutionalized racism, international relations persists not only in
habitual neglect and a deeply flawed theorization of race, but also in
actively resisting, marginalizing, depoliticizing, and hence
devalorizing anti-racist research and those who produce
it]{.underline}** (Bhambra et al., 2020; Chowdhry and Rai, 2009;
El-Malik, 2015; Shilliam, 2020; Vitalis, 2015). [Given epistemological
priorities, we might expect this resistance by conventionally
ahistorical, non-reflexive mainstream scholars]{.underline}. **[But it
is unexpected and poses fundamental questions when ardent resistance to
critique is practiced by self-identified critical scholars, whose
objectives presumably extend beyond the production of 'more accurate
descriptions' to include the reduction, or at least mitigation, of
structural violence.]{.underline}** [How is it possible for those who
claim a critical orientation to be so ill-prepared, and evidently
unwilling, to address 'the daily, structural racism that unmistakably
continues to plague our societies' (Rutazibwa, 2016: 192)? What
taken-for-granted premises and practices reproduce the invisibility of
racism and the apparent acceptance of its harms]{.underline}? [What are
we failing to 'see', and how does this compromise what critical security
studies and international relations scholars have to offer, especially
in the face of mounting crises and the urgency of developing more
adequate analyses?]{.underline}

**[Taking the social violence of systemic (structural,
institutionalized) racism as its starting point, my essay assumes that
race 'is a central organizing feature of world politics']{.underline}**
(Zvobgo and Loken, 2020), that '**[epistemic racism is intrinsic to
Western knowledge structures']{.underline}** **[and pervades
international relations theorizing]{.underline}** (Howell and
Richter-Montpetit, 2020: 4; see also Gruffydd Jones, 2016; Sabaratnam,
2020), **[and that 'taking the problem of racism seriously in the field
of \[international relations\] means viewing it not merely as an issue
of stereotypes or cultural insensitivities, but as a colonial technology
of life and premature death built on ideologies of whiteness and white
supremacy']{.underline}** (Rutazibwa, 2020). My forum intervention,
then, takes up Olivia Rutazibwa's (2016: 199) call 'to contribute to a
radically different, anti- or non-racist \[international relations\] and
everyday', and I do so by examining how the **[everyday and everywhere
power relations of white privilege make the reproduction of racism 'not
only possible but also invisible and acceptable']{.underline}**
(Rutazibwa, 2016: 196). While I address the forum's focus on racism, I
note that more adequate critical theorizing is undermined if the
reciprocally constructed phenomena of structural inequalities and
systems of privilege are treated in isolation.

### Link -- Global Order

#### Race and Identity are inextricable from hegemonic power regimes which makes a break between the colonial and postcolonial inconceivable

Relations, and Chipato**, **University of Ottawa CIPS postdoctoral

hooch//cs)

Having grasped the nature of the relationship between anti-Blackness and
security, [let us reflect on the assumptions underpinning the desire to
rejuvenate the criticality of the field through reparative approaches to
race.]{.underline} We see a potential problem with the argument that the
recent important work by the scholars like Sabaratnam (2020) and
Rutazibwa (2020) on [security's racial underpinnings has cleared the
ground for a project of accounting and reparation while maintaining
existing academic fields recognizably intact]{.underline}. Indeed,
recent work on race in security and global politics has highlighted many
potential issues, demonstrating the substantial challenge facing
reparative projects. As Anna Agathangelou and Kyle Killian (2016)
demonstrate, **[considered ontologically, coloniality is much more than
a set of space- and time-specific policy practices, but rather a
world-making (and worlds-destroying) practice through which our
understanding of global space and time is constructed]{.underline}**
(see also Grovogui, 2014; Jackson, 2020; Silva, 2007). Moreover,
**[critical sociological accounts of security and international
relations argue that the imposition of racial difference is intimately
tied to colonial and settler-colonial power as a technique of control
and regulation that naturalizes and reproduces differential powers and
capacities]{.underline}** (e.g. Henderson, 2013; Nisancioglu, 2020**[).
Race and white supremacy are thus inextricable from hegemonic regimes of
power and imposition, at the heart of the discipline, despite the
abstract categories of liberal political theory that structurally
operate to occlude the centrality of race to contemporary political
divisions and understandings]{.underline}**. As Gurminder Bhambra argues
(2017), **[the location of race is often displaced -- to claims to
identity and difference, seen to be racial -- while white-coded framings
of 'sovereignty' and 'class' obscure their racialized
grounding.]{.underline}** This important work on **[the nature of race
and racism in security studies shows that the problem is not so much one
of a lack of incorporation of questions of race and racism, but rather
that of a thoroughgoing saturation in issues of race.]{.underline}**
This ontological saturation implies that **[there can be no definitive
temporal break between the colonial past and a postcolonial present.
Coloniality remains in the present not only in residue, but rather as an
'ongoing and quotidian atrocity', inevitably problematizing attempts at
reparation]{.underline}** (see discussion in Sharpe, 2016: 20). **[We
are thereby fully sympathetic to Howell and Richter-Montpetit's (2019)
understanding that 'questions of race and racism' cannot be disentangled
from critical security studies or, for that matter, the broader field of
international relations]{.underline}**. As Jared Sexton (2008: 22)
powerfully notes, **[any attempt to separate 'questions of race and
racism' from systems, structures and institutions of power already risks
disavowing the centrality of race and its reduction to a secondary or
contingent aspect]{.underline}**.

### Link - Nuclear war

#### Racist narratives and the "love of the bomb" sit at the heart of whiteness and eurocentrism- their nuclear sword-shaking manifests as racist violence

**[Systemic racism plagues all levels of society, and the international
level is certainly no exception. National and international security
priorities have been dominated by white Western elite]{.underline}**,
[at the expense of peoples of colour around the world.]{.underline}
While indigenous people **[and peoples of colour have borne the brunt of
Western militarism]{.underline}**, [their contributions to international
peace and security are too often overlooked.]{.underline}

**[This is clearly the case with nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. Indian
author and **[activist Arundhati Roy said nuclear weapons were at 'the
very heart of whiteness']{.underline}**.1 **[Racism is embedded in
history and doctrine of nuclear weapons.]{.underline}** [Indigenous
peoples and communities of colour across the world have been
disproportionately harmed by these weapons]{.underline}. While
Indigenous peoples and peoples of colour have played a key role in
nuclear resistance movements for decades, established nuclear weapons
teachings too often ignore their contributions and perspectives.

**[Racism is at the core of fundamental assumptions about nuclear
weapons policy: who is permitted to develop nuclear weapons, who is
listened to and on whom the United States has considered dropping its
nuclear weapons.]{.underline}**

**[The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) codified what has been
described as a "nuclear apartheid" which divides states parties into
nuclear-weapon states and non-nuclear weapons states.]{.underline}**
[**The five nuclear-armed states -- China, France, Russia, the United
Kingdom and the United States position themselves as responsible nuclear
powers, while deeming other countries, including countries predominantly
of colour and former colonies, as irresponsible and illegitimate**,
including North Korea, India and Pakistan.]{.underline}

The [non-nuclear majority of states are too often sidelined in
conversations about nuclear weapons dominated by the five nuclear-weapon
states recognised by the NPT]{.underline}. At the United Nations, the
**[majority of countries who do not have nuclear weapons are often
deemed irrelevant and less serious than the permanent five members of
the UN Security Council in international fora]{.underline}**. A
pertinent example of this was the 2017 negotiations of the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), where **[non-western negotiating
states were often portrayed as "irrational", "emotional" and somehow
"less capable" of negotiating a Treaty than Western
governments]{.underline}**.

**[U.S. presidents have contemplated a nuclear first strike on
predominantly populations of colour]{.underline}**: the Taiwan Straits,
North Korea, North Vietnam and China.2 [In the only place where the
United States did use nuclear weapons in wartime, the public widely
supported the bombing partly due to anti-Japanese racism, depicting
Japanese people in 'subhuman terms**, in some cases fit for
extermination**]{.underline}

[Nuclear-armed states consistently **tested their nuclear weapons in
spaces they wrongly deemed 'distant' and 'empty'**, that were away from
national metropoles where decision-makers lived.]{.underline}4 **[This
led to many nuclear nations testing their weapons in their dependent
territories or colonies in which Indigenous peoples were situated with
ancestral connections to their lands and waters]{.underline}**, [such as
in New Mexico, Nevada, the Marshall Islands, Montebello Island,
Maralinga and Emu Field in Australia, Kiribati]{.underline} (formerly
the Gilbert and Ellice Island Colony[), Kazakhstan, Xinjiang, Algeria
and French Polynesia]{.underline}. For decades, **[Indigenous peoples
were displaced and relocated, suffering devastating humanitarian
consequences, including cancers and mental illness, irradiated
environments and food sources.]{.underline}** This has also dramatically
impacted how Indigenous peoples have been able to tread the road to
independence.

In the Pacific, [over 315 nuclear tests were held across the region,
many of which were many times larger than the ones used in Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. The U.S. government purposefully allowed a cloud of
radioactive fallout to descend upon Rongelap atoll with its peoples
present to later conduct human experiments on the impacts of
testing]{.underline}.5

In Kazakhstan, [Soviet elites chose the "uninhabited" land around
Semipalatinsk, which was the source of livelihood for thousands of
people, who grazed livestock in the area and sold meat thought the
Soviet Union, as well as culturally significant for the Kazak
people]{.underline}.6 The disproportionate impact of nuclear-weapon
activities on indigenous peoples is recognised in the preamble of the
Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.7

in the world, Black people make up one-third of the entire prison
population but only 12 percent of the total population,]{.underline} and
the recent murder of George Floyd has accentuated a history of brutal
killings of Black people. Moreover, Floyd's death finally seems to have
moved public opinion. In a recent survey by the Pew Research Center,
two-thirds of Americans now express support for the Black Lives Matter
movement.

Yet **[focusing exclusively on the United States neglects the extent to
which systemic racism deeply permeates law enforcement and criminal
justice in other highly developed Western democratic
countries]{.underline}**. A study in [Canada on fatal police encounters
from 2000 to 2017 found that]{.underline} [**Black people made up nearly
37 percent of the victims in Toronto, even though they comprised only 8
percent of the population.** In Australia, Black Lives Matter solidarity
protests sparked protests against the **police killings of indigenous
Australians, who are also grossly overrepresented in Australia's prisons
relative to their small population size**]{.underline}. And like in the
United States, [there is rarely any accountability for police brutality;
in the United Kingdom, for example, there has not been a successful
prosecution for a death in police custody in over fifty
years.]{.underline}

**[Racial profiling of Black people is also widespread]{.underline}**,
**[even in countries often held up as models of democratic governance by
the international community]{.underline}**. For example, **[for the last
three years, Freedom House has rated Finland as one of the freest
countries in the world, earning a perfect score]{.underline}** [in the
Freedom in the World Index**. However,**]{.underline} [according to the
"Being Black in the EU" survey,]{.underline} [administered by the
European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]{.underline} [across all
twenty-eight EU member states in 2018**, Finland recorded the highest
rates of race-based harassment and violence.** Participants in a
separate three-year study of racial profiling in Finland described in
detail their experiences of being stopped in public spaces predominantly
because of their race or ethnicity---including in railway and metro
stations, cars, shops and parks, and restaurants and bars and on the way
to work and school.]{.underline} The study notes the variety of **[state
security actors engaged in profiling, including the police, border
guards, and customs officers, as well as private security guards,
bouncers, and salespeople. Such pervasive levels of harassment and
surveillance of Black people in many Western democracies stand in sharp
contrast to the accolades often given to these "free"
societies.]{.underline}**

In the United States, [racial bias in policing and the violence it can
generate have eroded the state's relationship with Black
communities]{.underline}, **[diminishing trust and lowering expectations
for what residents of a democratic country should expect from their
government. There are signs that similar trends are also occurring in
other Western democracies, where Black people who experience policy
brutality or other kinds of racial discrimination feel they have no
recourse]{.underline}**. According to the "Being Black in the EU"
survey[, a majority of victims of racist physical attacks by police
officers did not report the most recent incident because they felt doing
so would not change anything or because they did not trust or were
afraid of the police.]{.underline} [**Because of a lack of trust**,
Europeans of African descent are also **not reporting incidents of
discrimination, such as being unable to obtain access to employment or
housing**]{.underline}. According to the survey, only 14 percent of
victims of race-based harassment reported their experiences to the
police, human rights institutions, or any other authority, despite
knowing about such institutions and the relevant antidiscrimination
laws.

racial discourse that emerged to justify colonialism and continuing
trusteeship.]{.underline}** **[This racial hierarchy is fully
represented in securitization theory's list of weak and failing
states]{.underline}**: [Nigeria under Abacha, Sudan, Sierra Leone,
Somalia, Liberia, and 'various parts of Africa', the USSR under Stalin,
Bosnia, Colombia, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and so on (]{.underline}see
Buzan et al., 1998: 28, 50, 69, 146). **[This is a racial discourse:

**[Copenhagen School theorists sometimes seem to be aware of how this

it.]{.underline}** On the contrary**[, they warn against
Western-centrism, but only in order to emphasize that it is in the West
that 'normal' civilized politics exists: 'if domestic and international
were fixed, there would be a risk of generating a cozy Western view of

extreme is relegated to the international space.]{.underline}** [In

only in the international realm, but also in non-Western 'other parts of
the world', where a failure of normal politics leads to '"tribalist"

**[Securitization theory refuses to seriously consider the role of
modern colonialism and ongoing imperial warfare in 'failed

civilizationist narrative that 'normal politics' emerged from 'primal
anarchy', this opposition would look as arbitrary as it in fact
is.]{.underline}

standpoints enabled the overturning of the relation, freeing the subject
from its oppression, alienation or exploitation]{.underline}**. As Frank

the form that governance takes, the practice of grounding this

learning, ever transforming]{.underline}. Therefore, **[the mere
inclusion of questions of race and racism, which maintain the
ontological structure of anti-Blackness, must perpetuate an anti-Black

### Impact -- Root Cause of War

"**[Should you not discuss racial prejudice as a prime cause of
war?"]{.underline}** (Du Bois 1915) The first unit of "International
Relations/[Black Internationalism" examines the causes of war and
introduces students to key concepts in the field of international
relations, including levels of analysis, the Westphalian nation-state,
and anarchy.]{.underline} We first examine texts by realist and liberal
thinkers, including debates about the democratic peace. We then turn to
Du Bois's "African Roots of War" (1915).9 "**[Should you not discuss
racial prejudice as a prime cause of war?" Du Bois begged an audience in
St. Louis and the readers of the Atlantic Monthl]{.underline}**y (1915,
§29). He wrote, "**[today most men assume that Africa lies far afield
from the center of our burning social problems, and especially from our
present problem of World War" (]{.underline}**1915, §1). This analysis
remains pertinent for students and scholars of international relations
more than one hundred years later---and at least as controversial.

[Much more than a straightforward critique of Eurocentric thinking, Du
Bois's account of World War I offers alternative ways of thinking about
international **relations. Centering Africa in the study of world
politics, past, present, and future, Du Bois writes, "in the Dark
Continent are hidden the roots, not simply of war today but of the
menace of wars tomorrow"**]{.underline} (1915, §2). "**[The African
Roots of War" offers a sharp contrast to both disciplinary and common
sense accounts of war.]{.underline}** To illustrate this point to
students who are new to international relations, we read Du Bois
alongside Stoessinger's (1990) rich history of World War I, an
explicitly Eurocentric narrative that employs a first-level analysis,
and Mearsheimer's (2001) offensive realism, which introduces students to
the abstractions of structural realism, its understandings of anarchy,
unitary actors, and the security dilemma. "**[The African Roots of War"
expands the questions students can ask about international
violence.]{.underline}** Rather than focusing on the immediate causes of
the outbreak of war in July 1914**[, Du Bois's account delves into the
history of imperial violence around the globe, from the "sinister
traffic" of the slave trade, through the Concert of Europe, the Berlin
Conference of 1884--85, to the "new imperialism" of the late
1800s]{.underline}**.

[Du Bois allows us to critically interrogate the "House of IR." Du
Bois's international relations simultaneously engages and displaces
ostensibly "race-neutral" guiding concepts of anarchy and social
contract at the heart of realist and liberal account]{.underline}s
(Henderson 2014, 19). **[Du Bois describes the "world's greed scurrying
down the hot, mysterious coasts of Africa to the Good
Hope]{.underline}**" (1915, §5) in **[search of the continent's "golden
joys"]{.underline}** (1915, §4**[). This centers the transatlantic slave
trade, which "cost black Africa no less than 100,000,000 souls" and "the
wreckage of its political and social life," and which "left the
continent in precisely that state of helplessness which invites
aggression and exploitation"]{.underline}** (Du Bois 1915, §8).

Moreover, "The African Roots of War" provokes a robust and critical
engagement with the scholarly literature on the democratic peace. Du
Bois (1915, §9) describes how **[European elites employed
social-contract claims and appeals to democracy and citizenship to gain
mass support for the "new imperialism" of the late nineteenth
century]{.underline}**. He writes**[: With the waning of the possibility
of the Big Fortune, gathered by starvation wage and boundless
exploitation of one's weaker and poorer fellows at home, arise more
magnificently the dream of exploitation abroad]{.underline}**... Soon,
[however, the mass of merchants at home demanded a share in this golden
stream; and finally, in the twentieth century, the laborer at home is
demanding and beginning to receive a part of his share]{.underline}
(1915, §12).

Du Bois's brief account of the global history of white supremacy is
instructive to many students. With **[the transatlantic slave trade, he
proposes, "the world began to invest in color prejudice. The 'Color
Line' began to pay dividends"]{.underline}** (1915, §9, emphasis added).
[This point is worth stressing. Undergraduate students immersed in
readings about the security dilemma may map common sense understandings
of racism onto ahistorical, abstracted accounts]{.underline} (see
discussion in Henderson 2014). Instead, **[Du Bois's offers a political
economy of white supremacy: The white workingman has been asked to share
the spoil of exploiting]{.underline}** "~~chinks and niggers."~~ It is
**[no longer simply the merchant prince, or the aristocratic monopoly,
or even the employing class, that is exploiting the world: it is the
nation; a new democratic nation composed of united capital and
labor]{.underline}**. The laborers are not yet getting, to be sure, as
large a share as they want or will get, and there are still at the
bottom large and restless excluded classes. But the laborer's equity is
recognized, and his just share is a matter of time, intelligence, and
skillful negotiation (1915, §15).

Finally, [Du Bois provides a manifesto for peace centered on land (1915,
§34), education (1915, §35), self-determination (1915, §36) as a means
to "economic power"]{.underline} (1915, §37[), radically repurposing the
liberal-imperialist lexicon of civilization and democracy]{.underline}.
Du Bois calls explicitly on his US audience: Our duty is clear.
**[Racial slander must go. Racial prejudice will follow. Steadfast faith
in humanity must come. The domination of one people by another without
the other's consent, be the subject people black or white, must
stop]{.underline}**. **[The doctrine of forcible economic expansion over
subject people must go. Religious hypocrisy must sto]{.underline}**p
(1915, §40).

**[Racism, the fuel of the global economic system, is at the heart of Du
Bois's theory of international relations]{.underline}**.11 Du Bois's
autobiography reinforces his scholarly contributions. Du Bois was a
graduate student at Harvard, as well as in Berlin in 1892 (Du Bois
1968). As a student, he faced discrimination and struggled to finance
his education. Our course follows Du Bois's life and political work,
inextricably tied to his scholarship. We follow him from the Pan-African
Congresses from 1900 onward, his observations of the Versailles
Conference, his presence at the founding of the United Nations, his
petitions to the UN Human Rights Commission (where he pushed Eleanor
Roosevelt to consider the limits of her vision), to his experience of US
government repression, and his final years in Ghana. Some of these
events are captured on photograph and film, which we examine in class

### Impact -- Racism

#### security and notions of "community" are rooted in racialization, the otherizing force of the empire which generates the violence of racism

**[Racial differentiation and its associated forms of violent
dispossession are foundational of and intrinsic to historical
capitalism]{.underline}**, as elaborated by Cedric Robinson's (2000)
concept of '**[racial capitalism' and Aníbal Quijano's (2000) notion of
the 'coloniality of power'. Capitalism, race-making and empire must
therefore be theorized in conjunction, yet without it being assumed that
their violent structures are fixed]{.underline}**. [In unpacking the
**social construction of race and its relation to structures of power,**
critical race theory's theorizations of racialization offer additional
insights into]{.underline} **[race-making as ongoing processes involving
'the extension of racial meaning to a previously unclassified
relationship, social practice or group']{.underline}** (Omi and Winant,
2014: 111). In this framework, [race and racism are dynamic, yet guided
by certain historical prerogatives. While importantly challenging the
notion of race as based on biological essences, the racialization
framework situates race as historically evolving but also as doing
particular kinds of work.]{.underline} It is in this sense that Patrick
**[Wolfe (2016) argues that race can be understood as a 'trace of
history'. Race is deeply ideological and works performatively in the
service of empire and capital: 'rather than simply describing human
groups, \[race\] brings them into being as inter-relating social
categories with behavioural prescriptions to match]{.underline}**.
[Racialization refers to this active productivity of race]{.underline},
**[whereby colonialism refashions its human terrain']{.underline}**
(Wolfe, 2016: 10). [This dual focus on race's productivity and
dynamism]{.underline} [enables us to apprehend its continuities with
historical forms of social differentiation as well as its ever-shifting
targets and contradictions across time and space]{.underline}. Indeed,
Singh (2012: 288--289) argues that [racialization can help us to more
fully grasp 'the empty foundationalism and ceaseless reinventedness that
seems to characterize the operation of race in modernity . . . "the
changing same"']{.underline}

**[Racialization addresses how racism functions to racialize and oppress
certain populations, and how the vulnerabilities and forms of protection
produced by racism work in governing]{.underline}**. As Singh (2012:
284--285) proposes, [to answer the vexing question**, What is
racism?**]{.underline} [one needs to begin not by identifying a set of
preexisting, already categorized groups that are done to]{.underline},
[but rather by delineating the formation and institutionalization of
structures and situations of protection and vulnerability for which post
hoc, descriptive accounts of dishonored group characteristics serve as a
form of rationalization or justification]{.underline}.

A focus on racialization or 'race in action' thus allows us to
**[address precursors of formal racial doctrine and apprehend how
various 'racializing practices' attempt to preserve population-centric
modes of colonial domination over time through racism]{.underline}**
(Wolfe, 2016: 10). **[Racism is produced through histories and
structures, but also through a particular kind of violence, including
the violence of demarcation.]{.underline}** As Ruth Wilson Gilmore puts
it, **[although 'race has no essence, racism does. Racism is singular
because, whatever its place-based particularities, its practitioners
renew fatal power-difference couplings']{.underline}** (Gilmore, 2002:
16, emphasis in original). This approach to **[racism locates the
fatalities it produces -- that is, 'premature deaths' -- as constitutive
of contemporary political power and subjectivitie]{.underline}**s. As
Gilmore (2002: 16) continues, **['racism is a practice of abstraction, a
death-dealing displacement of difference into hierarchies that organize
relations within and between the planet's sovereign political
territories']{.underline}**. Following Singh and Gilmore, Stuart
Schrader

(2019: 39--41) similarly explains: '**[Race is not racism's
predetermined object; it is what racism produces. . . . Racism produces
the benefit from state projects of race-making' -- that is,
whiteness]{.underline}**. In other words**[, race produces racism
through racialization]{.underline}**, **[which in turn accrues
particular material benefits to certain groups in the form of whiteness,
through its denial to others]{.underline}**. **[This enables identity
and 'community' formation around racial hatred and the shared defence of
whiteness]{.underline}** (Ahmed, 2004: 118) **[and strategies to
eliminate Blackness.]{.underline}** **[Racism thereby (re)produces and
naturalizes racial hierarchies as 'commonsense' markers of global
difference and knowledge production]{.underline}** (Quijano, 2000,
2007).

### Impact - Negation of Black life

#### Global capital and policy thrive on the societal insistence of Black inhumanity which enables infinite violence upon Black bodies

Willie, 2018, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space2019, Vol.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0263775818805102, accessed
on 7-11-2022 hooch//cs)

[**Violent forms of domination accompany (and make possible) the
reproduction of global capitalism. This violence targets all manner of
people,** specifically those who do not exhibit a form of humanity
normalized under Western modernity (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) and gender nonconforming folk, Muslims,
Latinx, and undocumented immigrants) or a manner of spatiality that
adheres to the tenets of capitalist notions of individual
ownership]{.underline} (Mitchell, 2003). [**Under this new phase of
capitalism**, ever-expanding groups of people are subjected to
precarious life (Mbembe, 2017]{.underline}). **[Still, experiences of
anti-Blackness remain unique, as the openness of Black people to
violence and the assumed a-spatial nature of Black populations remain
constitutive factors of the modern world]{.underline}**. **[The logics
underpinning anti-Black violence are inheritances of chattel slavery.
These logics cast Black geographies as empty and threatening, open to
occupation, and subject to surveillance and assault]{.underline}**.
Indeed, **[capitalism's perpetuation relies as much on anti-Blackness as
it ever has.]{.underline}** The following section seeks to clarify the
ways in which **[antiBlackness makes capital accumulation
possible]{.underline}**.

**[The increasing globalization]{.underline}** [of capital and spatial
marginalization of "superfluous" populations]{.underline} **[is
fundamentally tied to the negation of Black life and assumptions of
Black nonbeing]{.underline}**. **[The treatment of Black lives as the
embodied absence of value, or, "the very condition of existence and the
determination of value," underpins Black non-being and the assumed lack
of Black cartographic capacity in the dominant spatial imaginary, making
global capitalism possible]{.underline}** (Ferreira da Silva, 2017: 1).
[The interconnected nature of capitalism and race is a well-worn
topic.]{.underline} [**Scholars have theorized race as an ideological
outgrowth of the economy** (Hall, 1996); as an apparatus used to
facilitate flows of people and commodities (Lowe, 2015); as a central
component of capitalist maturation (James, 1989); and as a phenomenon
necessary for the establishment of the world system (Robinson, 2000),
among countless other approaches]{.underline}. Geographers, too, have
unpacked the ways in which regimes of capitalism employ racialized
concepts to reproduce. Geographic interrogations of racial capitalism
have analyzed the role of racist assumptions in implementing neoliberal
reforms in the wake of a natural disaster (Derickson, 2014); the
manipulation of racial distinction to prevent labor organizing (Wilson,
2000); how resistance to Black landownership underpinned early
20th-century industrial agriculture (Williams, 2017); the role of
capitalism in perpetuating environmental racism (Pulido, 2017); and the
centrality of plantation relations to numerous variations of capitalism
(Woods, 1998)

**[Nonetheless, we must push further to explicate the ways in which
capitalism is actually dependent on anti-Blackness to realize
itself,]{.underline}** **[instead of understanding anti-Black racism as
a secondary effect of the economy or a phenomenon that emerges
periodically.]{.underline}** That is to say, [**reflections on the
interlinked nature of race and capitalism must move beyond an assumption
of economic causality and grapple with the ways in which anti-Blackness
is actually an always-present precondition for capital accumulation**.
In explicating anti-Blackness]{.underline}, we draw on an Afro-Pessimist
framework, as Afro-Pessimism makes distinct claims about the nature of
Blackness in the modern world. An Afro-Pessimist analysis of
**[antiBlackness does not treat anti-Black racism as a contingent
phenomenon (Wilderson, 2011: 3--4) but rather as a global, ever-present
factor that exists as the basis "for expansion and unending space within
the symbolic economy of settlement]{.underline}**" (King, 2014). [Such
an approach forces us to recognize how anti-Blackness punctuates the
modern epoch by identifying the underlying logics that inform concrete
manifestations of anti-Black racism around the world]{.underline}. In
this way, Afro-Pessimism adds new dimensions to already-existing work on
the connections between anti-Blackness and political economy by
recognizing that, **[while capitalism exploits all of the world's
populations, it does not dominate all of them in the same
way]{.underline}**. **[With regard to the question of space,
anti-Blackness helps us understand how the afterlife of
slavery]{.underline}** (Hartman, 2007: **[6) leads to Black populations
being conceptually unable to legitimately create space, thereby leaving
locations associated with Blackness open to the presumably "rational"
agendas of dominant spatial actors. Black populations, then, serve as
the guarantor of capitalism's need to constantly find new spaces of
accumulation.]{.underline}** In this section, we offer an explanation of
how **[capitalism relies on anti-Blackness by foregrounding
anti-Blackness as a phenomena with its own internal logics and concrete
expressions.]{.underline}**

**[Capitalism is rooted in violent forms of captivity and murder
unleashed on indigenous and Afro-descendant populations the world
over]{.underline}** (Ferreira da Silva, 2004; James, 1989; Rodney, 1972;
Williams, 2014; Wynter, 1995**[). At its origin and in its contemporary
manifestations, then, capitalism is systemically related to slavery and
its various global permutations]{.underline}** (Robinson, 2000:
313--314). **[The assumption that Black populations lack both humanity
and "space, that is ethno- or politico-geography," defines the treatment
of enslaved Black peoples]{.underline}**. **[Today, the assumed
a-spatiality that defined conditions of chattel slavery continues to
imprint the socio-spatial relations that reproduce global capital
(]{.underline}**Robinson, 2000: 81, 200).

**[Black populations are deemed a-spatial as a result of the fact that
modern notions of space and practices of spatial production are rooted
in specific relations of power]{.underline}** (Massey, 2005: 64,
100--101). **[These power relations are themselves organized around
logics that have particular historical roots]{.underline}** (Santos,
2008: 21). [In the colonial epoch**, chattel slavery**---the social,
legal, and political reduction of Africans to the status of
nonhumans]{.underline}---**[produced the figure of the Black, which had
a nullified spatial capacity]{.underline}** (Wilderson, 2010: 279**[),
was disavowed as a human being]{.underline}** (Ferreira da Silva, 2015:
91), [and was a priori structurally prevented from enacting "rational"
spatial expressions]{.underline} (Santos, 2009: 24). **[Locations
associated with Black populations became wholly "unhallowed" spaces,
which would never receive recognition as legitimately
occupied]{.underline}** (Wynter, 1976: 81). [This is not to suggest that
Black peoples were or are understood as not physically
present]{.underline}. [Black bodies are certainly recognized as existing
in exteriority]{.underline} (Raffestin, 2012: 129). **[Still, this
recognition of physical presence does not signify that Black
populations' are understood as establishing legible
space]{.underline}**. **[Despite physical presence, Black populations
nonetheless remain rendered "ungeographic" in dominant understandings of
space]{.underline}** (McKittrick, 2006: x[). Hence, the geographic
locations in which Black populations reside are treated as open to the
varied agendas espoused by dominant spatial actors]{.underline}

Capitalism's new rounds of accumulation require access to spaces that
previously had different relations to capitalist practices. [The assumed
a-spatiality of Black populations often leads to purveyors of capitalism
treating locations inhabited by Black people as available for emerging
modes of accumulation. Put another way, spaces that were once marginal
or peripheral to the perpetuation of capital accumulation become sites
of appropriation precisely because the (Black) populations occupying
them receive no recognition as viable spatial actors]{.underline}.
**[The spaces necessary for new forms of accumulation are thus
conceptually open because of this assumed a-spatiality and subsequently
physically opened via the spatial removal and dispersal of Black
residents]{.underline}**. **[This dispersal entails violent
actions]{.underline}** [that are a priori legitimate because of the
assumed lack of Black spatial agency]{.underline}. In other words**[,
new spaces of "investment have been mapped onto previous racial and
colonial (imperial) discourses and practices" evidencing an inextricable
relationship between anti-Black notions of space, capitalism's logic of
perpetual expansion, and the acceptable subordination of Black physical
presence]{.underline}** (Chakravartty and Silva, 2012: 368). This is
what Frank Wilderson terms the "deterritorialisation of Black space"
(2003: 238) that is necessary for accumulating capital vis-a\`-vis
emerging political economic practices. Katherine McKittrick similarly
notes [that Black geographies are cast as "the lands of no one" **and
"emptied out of life" in order that "suitable capitalist life-support
systems" be put into place and globally propagated**]{.underline}
(McKittrick, 2013: 7).

A number of **[present-day practices demonstrate the reliance of capital
on this notion of empty, lifeless, Blackened spaces, such as capital
disinvestment, white flight, gentrification, urban renewal,
incarceration, and policing]{.underline}**. **[These spatial
arrangements identify Black peoples as inhuman]{.underline}** [and
locations associated with Black populations as lacking a legitimate form
of occupation and usage]{.underline}. [Such assumptions contribute to
the subordination of Black populations and spaces to dominant notions of
"appropriate" uses of space, while "illegitimate" spaces of Blackness
remain under siege by purveyors of capit]{.underline}al. As this occurs,
new spaces of accumulation open in areas formerly peripheral to the
capitalist agenda. At the same time that these new rounds of
accumulation take place, **[sovereign expressions of power serve to
forcibly remove Black people and ensure they remain separated from these
new spaces of accumulation.]{.underline}** Subsequently[, **Black people
are routinely harassed for existing in the communal spaces** in which
they have resided for generations]{.underline}.

Along with [**public policy shifts**, policing, incarceration, and
extrajudicial killings]{.underline} **[simultaneously disqualify Black
spatial agency and remove Black bodies from spaces deemed open for
appropriation by capitalism's purveyors, thereby simultaneously
spatializing antiBlackness]{.underline}** **[and reproducing global
capital]{.underline}**. [The systemic casting of Black spaces as
lifeless and open to appropriation for the continuation of capital
breathes new life into]{.underline} "**[civil society's political
economy: \[the Black body\] kick-starts\...capital at its genesis and
rescues it from its over-accumulation crisis at its end---black death is
its condition of possibility"]{.underline}** (Wilderson, 2003: 238**[).
Put simply, the endless accumulation of capital and its legitimating
sovereign practices are, in part, made possible through the continued
societal insistence on Black inhumanity]{.underline}** [and a Black lack
of cartography, which casts Black spaces as empty.]{.underline}

#### Security is predicated on the genocide of Black bodies and is reliant upon the construction of boundaries between who is truly human

**[Today we know that 'security' is just another word for extinction and
genocide.]{.underline}** **[Every discourse of securing implies that
there is a ground to be secured, a 'home', a way of being that is
threatened or that requires saving, sustaining and being located within
a temporality and spatiality]{.underline}**. **[It is precisely this
security that is denied in an anti-Black world]{.underline}**. As
Saidiya Hartman argues, **[only recognized subjects have something to
secure; for others, 'home' is an impossibility: 'We stay there, but we
don't live there]{.underline}**' (Hartman, 2007: 87). As has already
been stated, **[every ground of this discourse is built on
anti-Blackness]{.underline}**. [However inclusive the space that is
secured]{.underline}, **[it will always require a boundary, a
delineation of an outside that is inhabited by those who cannot be full
human subjects]{.underline}**. **[Every cut between that to be secured
and that which can be left or seen as expendable or without value
necessarily depends on 'questions of race and racism]{.underline}**'.

### Impact -- Takes out Solvency (Disinformation)

#### Attempts to counter misinformation must overcome legacies of imperialism and militarism in local diasporas.

Asian diasporic communities: The need for critical transnational
research beyond Anglocentrism." https://doi.org/10.37016/mr-2020-95,
accessed 7-7-2022) SS:/

In initial interviews and informal conversations with different
organizers and community groups, [four themes emerged as hurdles to
overcome in order to conduct critical, transnational, and
community-oriented research on the spread and impact of misinformation
on diasporic communities]{.underline}:

[**1. Legacies of imperialism and militarism and ongoing geopolitical
tensions across diasporas***:*]{.underline} Mis- and [disinformation
spreads across cultural, socio-linguistic, and geographic contexts and
impacts communities differently according to pre-existing power
structures and unequal distributions of informational
resources]{.underline} (Thakur & Hankerson, 2021). In order to
adequately examine the ways in which mis- and disinformation circulates
in Asian diasporic communities, a grounding in the histories of these
communities is needed to contextualize the multiple layers of power
interests. [This may include legacies]{.underline} of British
imperialism such as in India, Spanish and [U.S. imperialism]{.underline}
such as in the Philippines, or even intra-Asian imperialist pursuits
such as Japan's rule of Korea. [In other words, race "in the national",
or race as understood within national boundaries such as the U.S., is
also situated within conditions of empire and transnational
contexts]{.underline} (Reddy, 2011, p. 19). [The predominance of
English-language research is also underpinned by academia's colonial
legacy and Anglophone Western foundations in knowledge
production]{.underline} (Chakravartty et. al, 2018; Mejia et al., 2018;
Geeraert, 2018)---dominant in empirical research. [The resulting
theoretical frameworks privilege whiteness and fail to address the
geopolitical contexts of mis- and disinformation in immigrant and
diasporic communities, as well as the ways legacies of imperialism
structure media systems]{.underline} (Aouragh & Chakravartty, 2016).

**[2. Transnational news networks and information
infrastructures]{.underline}***:* Transnational ties refer to the
affective, communicative, and economic relationships that migrant
families build between the societies of origin and destination. They are
complex multidirectional, multilayered, and multilingual networks with
intergenerational connections established through continual global
migration (Wakabayashi & O'Hagan, 2021). Within the context of mis- and
disinformation, it becomes important to look further than a primary
relational stream (i.e., U.S. plus the rest of the world) via the
dominant language (e.g., English), which fails to account for the
dynamism of language and culture, geographically and temporally.

Many first-generation immigrants with limited English proficiency turn
to ethnic media, including print, broadcast, and social media, as
primary sources of information (Fang, 2021; Nguyen & Solomon, 2021). For
example, in the context of Indian immigrants, Somani (2013) finds that
first-generation Indians in the diaspora often prefer Indian television
channels over local channels. Not only does it keep them abreast with
happenings in India from an Indian perspective, but it also
"reinforc\[es\] their group identification" (Somani, 2013, p. 61). This
trend is reproduced online: YouTube in the Vietnamese diaspora is an
information-rich space for community, news, entertainment, and business,
as well as a site of ideological polarization (Dien, 2017; Anh, 2018; H.
Nguyen, 2021; P. Nguyen, 2021). Information propagates through various
channels across multiple disparate nations and languages with
individuals disseminating ideas rapidly through social circles and
across platforms (Zeng et al., 2016)---making "local" problems "global"
ones.

[**3. Lack of data access***:* Private forms of communication, such as
mobile messaging apps, facilitate the spread of mis- and disinformation
and necessitate culturally informed and relational modes of study,
beyond simple challenges of data access]{.underline} (Malhotra, 2020).
According to a 2020 voter survey, nearly one in six Asian Americans use
messaging applications such as WeChat, WhatsApp, and KaKao to discuss
politics (APIA Vote, AAPI Data, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice,
2020). [Access to data on]{.underline} these [applications is difficult
to obtain without direct consent from users and raises additional
questions over data ethics and surveillance]{.underline} (Barbosa &
Milan, 2019). This means less empirical study and public evidence about
how and what types of mis- and disinformation spread within Asian
diasporic communities due to information sharing within closed, private
networks.

Often, this [evidence comes from first-hand observations that occur
through informal discussions, such as screenshots sent to family and
friends.]{.underline} Additionally, information networks are
geographically siloed, making it difficult for U.S. scholars doing
transnational research to access data eclipsed by the dominance of U.S.
media. This does not mean that currently available observations are not
significant, nor does this mean a lack of robust knowledge-sharing
activity. Several [community organizations]{.underline}, such as Viet
Fact Check^3^ and Equality Labs,^4^ [have been undertaking their own
forms of research within their own diasporic communities, including
developing customized media monitoring techniques, creating community
surveys, and making in-language toolkits and platforms for
community-specific interventions]{.underline}. However, this research
can pose issues for scholarly replicability and also pose high
individualized and collective risks given ongoing nationalisms and
authoritarianism within countries of origin.

**[4. Issues of language interpretation and
translation]{.underline}***:* [Translation in mis- and disinformation
research is complicated, given the limitations of automated
transcription and machine-based translation to offer contextual
interpretation, as well as at times limited monetary resources for human
translation and transcription]{.underline}. [We understand translation
and language as political, considering what is or is not translated, how
it is translated, how interpretations are altered between languages, and
how the impact of translation on information spreads.]{.underline}
Importantly, [translating services such as Google Translate favor
Eurocentric interpretations of texts that do not adequately address the
contexts from which they come]{.underline} (Nasser, 2017). For example,
community activists working on 2020 Get Out the Vote (GOTV) campaigns
within Hmong communities^5^ in California highlighted frustrations
around mistranslations on voter registration websites. While government
landing pages offered options to translate the page into Hmong, the
translations offered up contained significant mistranslations, embedding
a sense of exclusion for Hmong voters (Ryan-Mosley, 2021). [Researchers
need to look beyond verbatim translations to the historical and
socio-cultural factors that shape the way information is crafted and
distributed.]{.underline}

### Impact -- Turns Democracy (Disinformation)

#### Impact Turn - Computational modes of defense fail to address the structural hegemonic norms that construct identity-based disinformation which undermines democracy.

We believe [it is imperative that scholars of mis- and disinformation
and propaganda consider not just the epistemological status of claims,
but also how strategic attempts to undermine and weaponize people's
social identities and group membership for political gains happen in
accord with racial and other structures that underlie social
differentiation]{.underline}. [Computational means alone do not get at
the latent meaning embedded in propagandistic appeals.]{.underline} In
particular, [we hope the field invests more energy into the examination
of the social and racial structures that constitute social division and
social power, which, in turn, provide identity propaganda with its forms
and structures and makes it legible as political symbolism.]{.underline}
[Only by doing the interpretive work of analyzing this content via these
deeper social hierarchies can scholars shine light on the structure of
appeals and how power gets reproduced.]{.underline} We also look forward
to future research that looks more deeply at how identity propaganda is
mediated across different contemporary digital platforms.

**[The broader stakes of identity propaganda concern the undermining of
democracy.]{.underline}** [Our theoretical intervention aims to open
opportunities for incisive empirical analyses that critically
interrogate structural antagonisms embedded in societies. Politics is
about relations of and to power]{.underline} (Cohen, 1997). [By
analyzing relations of power rather than individual identities, we can
also be better positioned to make the necessary, generative, critical,
and nuanced arguments that push for the political transformations needed
to undo the structural hegemonic norms and inequalities so deeply
embedded in political systems.]{.underline}

#### Fear of foreign actors leads to curtailing the flow of information and that leads to increased xenophobia

Social Change Research Project Researcher, 20**

Disinformation
\", https://www.cigionline.org/articles/risks-exaggerating-foreign-influence-operations-and-disinformation/, accessed

[Second, **the fear of foreign speech could exacerbate ongoing tensions
between states in a way that will likely hurt civil society and press
freedom**.]{.underline} Although influence operations have little (if
any) actual impact on a state's national security, [governments may use
the fear of foreign speech to expel, control and surveil foreign
journalists and civil society. Take China and the United
States]{.underline}, for example. [Both accuse one another of
interfering in each other's domestic affairs, citing influence
operations and collusion that may be detrimental]{.underline} (although
rarely articulated in specifics or evidence). [As such, retaliatory
measures have been carried out by both states through the expulsion of
journalists and by forcing media workers to register personal
information with government officials.]{.underline} Hua Chunying, a
spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, defended the expulsion of
journalists from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The
Washington Post, tweeting: "We reject ideological bias against China,
reject fake news made in the name of press freedom, reject breaches of
ethics in journalism." And as Harvard Law School's Evelyn Douek shows in
her chapter for the forthcoming book, "Combating Election Interference:
When Foreign Powers Target Democracies,[" the way social media companies
and governments are moderating foreign content amounts to a "free speech
blind spot," due to their seemingly ad hoc and inconsistent enforcement.
The ongoing rhetoric of fear surrounding foreign influence operations
and espionage is now expanding to include foreign students and
businesses. **In addition to curtailing the flow of information and
intellectual collaboration, such actions may also contribute to
increasing xenophobia**.]{.underline}

# Alternative

### Alternative 

#### Alternative -- Only abandoning the epistemic core and infrastructural framework of international relations can open a new disciplinary agenda

**Sen, Roskilde University International Development Studies Associate
Professor, 21** (Somdeep, "Colouring critical security studies: A view
from the classroom", Security Dialogue, 2021, Vol. 52(S) 133-141, EBSCO,
GDI access 7/12/22)

The question remains**[: What would a non-racist discipline look like?
It is presumptuous to think that any number of reparative pedagogical
strategies would allow us to simply escape international relations'
historically entrenched racist precepts.]{.underline}** Aijaz Ahmad
(1992: 77) once wrote that 'history is not really open to correction
through a return passage to an imaginary point, centuries ago, before
the colonial deformation set in'. Ahmad was of course referring to the
English language and the feasibility of effacing it as an integral facet
of the colonized people's identity (for further dis- cussion, see Sen,
2020b: 142-146). Without stretching this metaphor too far, I would argue
that **[international relations' racist history is not open to course
correction]{.underline}** either. But while we cannot change this
history, we can choose what to do with it.

At the outset, then, **[this requires the recognition of a foundational
dilemma,]{.underline}** namely, **[that racism is not just an aspect of
international relations: it characterizes the very nature and purpose of
the discipline]{.underline}**. **[A non-racist international relations
would thus need to position itself as not just an endeavour to add a
critical pillar within the existent white-supremacist disciplinary
structures and norms. It would need be something else
altogether.]{.underline}** For one thing, cognizant of the racialized
intel- lectual foundations of international relations as it is taught
today, **[the non-racist international rela- tions would look elsewhere
for the intellectual building blocks of a new epistemic
core]{.underline}**. To this end, it would need to draw on a
well-established (albeit ignored and marginalized) legacy of scholarship
within international relations that has deliberated the role of racism
and white supremacy in the making of the global order. However, the
purpose of this scholarly legacy in the non-racist disci- pline is
**[not to simply speak to the mainstream from the outside
in]{.underline}** or languish in the category of 'critical approaches'
that often appears at the back end of international relations curricula
and textbooks. **[Instead, in a non-racist international relations, the
works]{.underline}** of, among others, Alain Locke (\[1916\] 1992), W.
E. B. Du Bois (1903, 1915) and Merze Tate (1943, 1961), along with the
more recent scholarly engagement with questions of race and racism,2
**[would be placed at the very top of the disciplinary hierarchy as the
mainstream and recognized for their indispensable contribution to the
scholarly agenda of international relations.]{.underline}**

**[However, the racism of international relations is not just a matter
of its core intellectuality ori- entation. It is equally reflected in
the material consequences]{.underline}** of its racist precepts, evident
not least in hirings, tenure decisions and grant-giving practices.
**[All of these act as the infrastructure that keeps up the colour line
and function as a nexus of (dis)incentives that renders it
professionally unwise to critique international relations' racialized
epistemic core]{.underline}**. In contrast, in the non-racist
international relations, practitioners of the discipline would not need
to fear - as I did - the optics and consequences of critiquing
international relations' racist legacy. On the contrary, such efforts
would be deemed an extension of the core purpose of the non-racist
discipline. **[Seen together]{.underline}**, what I propose **[here is
the abandoning of international relations in its current
form]{.underline}**. **[However, theorizing 'interstate
relations']{.underline}** (Weber, 2015: 29; for further discussion, see
Wight, 1960; Cox, 1981) **[remains a worthwhile disciplinary agenda. And
the non-racist international relations can make an invalua- ble
contribution to this agenda by revealing the multiple, positioned ways
in which politics is understood and experienced.]{.underline}**

### Alternative -- Security Abolition

#### Thus we affirm a rejection of the security logics of the plan and engage in an unstitching of racialized security through abolition

**Machold, University of Glasgow Lecturer in International Relations in
Politics and Charrett**, **University of Westminster Senior Lecturer in
Global Politics, 21** (Rhys and Catherine, 2021, Security Dialogue2021,
Vol. 52(S) 38--48, \"Beyond ambivalence: Locating thewhiteness of
security\", https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09670106211031044,
pages 7-8 accessed on 7-8-2022 hooch//cs)

[Here, we identify five points that can guide critical security studies
debates vis-a-vis race.]{.underline} Our suggestions are far from
exhaustive but touch upon, as we see things, matters that are in need of
pressing attention. [We situate these as part of furthering
methodological thinking in critical security studies (Aradau et al.,
2015; De Goede et al., 2019; Salter and Mutlu, 2013), which only
addresses race and the coloniality of power tangentially.]{.underline}

**[Security's violent histories and raced foundations should inform how
we approach security per se. 'Race' has been approached as an optional
category of analysis that certain specialists of race attend to and
others can ignore.]{.underline}** However, following Alison Howell's
(2018: 120) [questioning of the idea of liberal politics as 'un-security
or un-military', we argue that we should similarly question the notion
of security as un-raced. We need to begin from the premise of the always
already connectedness of race--security.]{.underline}

**[Taking race seriously in critical security studies means locating
security within its material conditions of possibility and actively
de-fetishizing it]{.underline}**. **[Racism is an abstraction that
produces fetishes (Gilmore, 2002), and security is one such
fetish]{.underline}** (Neocleous, 2008). [Security is fetishized and
normalized through histories of anti-Black racism whose 'central concern
\[is\] of the libidinal and affective economies that animate historical
capitalism']{.underline} (McQuade, 2018: 13). [De-fetishizing security
means beginning to situate behaviours and meanings in their social,
historical and cultural contexts, as a means of challenging essentialist
and deterministic analysis.]{.underline} **[When we anchor security
projects in specific milieus, we begin to understand the work they do in
hiding racial violence and dispossession, their impacts and the
complicity of academics therein]{.underline}**

**[We can never apprehend the intersections of race--security as somehow
exceptional or geographically isolated]{.underline}**. Rather, [the
focus needs to be on how race is produced through transnational and
transtemporal encounters, in the sense that 'racial ideas, meanings,
exclusionary and repressive practices in one place are influenced,
shaped by and fuel those elsewhere' (]{.underline}Goldberg, 2009: 1274).
**[Nevertheless, we should anticipate that the relationships between
racialization and security are highly varied, which requires that they
be investigated in local articulations.]{.underline}** S**[uch an
approach develops a historical sensitivity to how security's racializing
imperatives travel and push peripheral states or groups to perform the
'dirty work' of capital and national (in)security]{.underline}**
(Agathangelou, 2004: 2).

**[Rejecting security as a fabrication, a myth and a lie requires
refusing and actively unstitching the categories that security takes as
given]{.underline}**. [Against the prevailing tendency in critical
security studies to focus on how racialized communities are further
disenfranchised or 'securitized', we cannot take othered populations as
given. Rather, the focus needs to be on how security regimes, ideas and
prerogatives work to render populations as 'out of place']{.underline}
(Wolfe, 2016: 17[) and therefore in need of targeting, erasure or
removal through security. **We must address how specific technologies of
security help to make race and racial subjugation rather than
reproducing 'epistemological organization through which some bodies are
damned, and others are not'**]{.underline} (McKittrick, 2011: 958). 5.
**[If we take the imperatives of de-fetishization and abolitionism
seriously, how we refer to the key actors involved in 'security'
matters]{.underline}**. This prompts us to ask new questions: Should we,
for instance, reproduce their own self-presentation as 'security
professionals' (Bigo, 2002) or instead try to rename them in a way that
foregrounds the raced and violent foundations of their work? Here, some
have notably proposed that 'law enforcement' officers be renamed
'violence workers' (Seigel, 2018) and security practitioners as
'security fuckers' (James Kelman, cited in Neocleous, 2008: 1)

#### 

#### alternative is a total rejection of security on the grounds of its inseparability from race and racism

**Chandler, University of Westminster Professor of International
Relations, and Chipato**, **University of Ottawa CIPS postdoctoral
fellow, 21**  (David and Farai, 2021, Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S)
60--68,\"A call for abolition: The disavowal and displacement of race in
critical security studies\",

hooch//cs)

[What, then, does it mean for the field if the grounds of critical
security studies are the grounds of anti-Blackness?]{.underline} [Not
'just' the 'foundations' but the grounds that enable the divide between
the 'foundations' and the 'novel and ethico-politically committed ways'
(Security Dialogue, 2020) to be discovered in the present or in the
future**. The grounds that enable the authorized critical security
studies subject to articulate the desire for 'reparation' and for
'ethico-politically committed ways' to enable the continuation of a
project that has no ground of its own**]{.underline}. **[The
investigation of antiBlackness we have presented suggests that, at an
ontological level, only questions of race and racism exist, and critical
security studies is a form of their expression]{.underline}**. To
reiterate our position: we have sought to make two fairly
straightforward points. First**[, on the questions of race and racism,
there is a possibility that no reparative ethico-political openings can
be made from within the subject position of critical security
studies.]{.underline}** **[To pursue this reparative project would
require the reinstatement of the series of closures and exclusions that
constitute the hegemonic imaginaries of the discipline]{.underline}**.
Second, critical [security scholars should consider whether in fact
there can be any repair-ation or repair of critical security
studies]{.underline}. We build on the important **[existing critiques of
race in security studies to argue that to take seriously the question of
race and racism would clarify the difficulty, perhaps even the
impossibility, of any reparation]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[perhaps the
only possibility of a truly novel and ethical future lies in abolition
of the entire intellectual, institutional, ontological edifice that
critical security studies is embedded in.]{.underline}** As Harney and
Moten (2013: 152) argue, **[for the field of critical or radical thought
more generally, 'what it is that is supposed to be repaired is
irreparable. It cannot be repaired. The only thing we can do is tear
this shit down completely and build something new.']{.underline}**

### Alternative - Recognize whiteness

#### we call for a naming and recognizing of whiteness within security studies in an effort to enable a restructuring of security scholarship. The alt is the first step to dismantling racism in academia 

**Guerra, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro Senior Field
Assistant 21** (Lucas, 2021, Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S) 28--37
\"Security as white privilege: Racializing whiteness in critical
security studies\",
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09670106211027797?journalCode=sdib
accessed on 7-9-2022, hooch//cs)

In this short intervention, I aimed to highlight how **[whiteness and
white privilege, although notably unnamed and unmarked, are structural
and structuring categories in critical security studies practices and
understandings]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[naming and racializing
whiteness in the field is a necessary first step if we are to be able to
imagine reparative possibilities within it.]{.underline}** As Philip
Howard (2004: 75) highlights: **[it is vitally important that racially
dominant bodies that would take up anti-racist work and live out
oppositional whiteness realize that their choice to do so does not stop
the privilege of whiteness from converging upon their bodies, nor does
it guarantee that they have escaped the looming possibility that
whiteness will find expressions through their bodies and
work]{.underline}**. **[Dominant anti-racist scholars need to
consciously and continuously take responsibility for their implication
in whiteness regardless of their personal politics]{.underline}**.

[Hence, to recognize the racial implications of our whiteness and
privileges **does not mean an 'arrival' at an absolute anti-racist
awareness**]{.underline}. [Rather,]{.underline} **[it means assuming our
involuntary complicity with a system of structural racial oppression and
acknowledging the necessity of maintaining a 'constant
vigilance']{.underline}** (a term that will certainly provoke goosebumps
in some critical security studies scholars) **[on our practices, works,
and social relations.]{.underline}**

As Grada Kilomba (2019: 11) puts it, 't**[his path of collective
conscience-taking . . . is not a moral path, but a responsibility-taking
path. The responsibility of creating new forms of power and knowledge'.
To take this responsibility, then, demands that we 'stop asking the
classical moral question]{.underline}** "**[Am I a racist?" and wait for
a comfortable answer, and start asking "How can I dismantle my own
racism?"]{.underline}** **[This question, by itself, already starts the
process']{.underline}** (Kilomba, 2019: 46). **[To that, Djamila Ribeiro
(2019b: 13) adds: 'racism was invented by whiteness, so that white
people must take responsibility for it. . . .]{.underline}** [That does
not mean that one should feel guilty for being white:]{.underline}
**[the point is to take responsibility. Guilt drives to inertia,
responsibility drives to action']{.underline}**

**[In this process of taking responsibility, to name, recognize, and
constantly confront the racism that we inevitably reproduce as white
scholars is important, but only the first step towards
anti-racist/abolitionist knowledges and practices]{.underline}**. [Being
aware of our positions in systems of power and privilege and how they
reverberate in our work, **we should aim to disturb and disrupt these
very positions, for it is 'only when power structures are reconfigured
that many marginalized identities may finally reconfigure our notions of
knowledge'**]{.underline} (Kilomba, 2019: 13). [We are not exempt from
the possibility of making mistakes in the process of confronting our
privileged positions in knowledge production]{.underline}. **[In my own
effort to name and disturb whiteness in critical security studies, I may
have reproduced several racist and racially problematic assumptions,
alongside a set of privileged positions and ignorance]{.underline}**.
**[The point, I think, is that we can no longer afford not to face the
question of whiteness and white privilege and their constant
reproduction in our field]{.underline}**.

[In June 2021, a subscriber of Vietnamese conservative influencer Sonia
Ohlala1 sent the following message via encrypted messaging app Telegram:
"Black Lives Matter is a movement set up by all the communists to loot,
oppress people, and cheat money from donors."2 The message's focus on
"communists" makes salient how the historical context of socialism and
communism within Vietnamese diasporic groups has been weaponized to
stoke negative sentiment around Black Lives Matter---leveraging
historical frameworks to increase the saliency of particularized
misinformation.]{.underline} Moreover[, the sharing of the message on
the encrypted messaging app Telegram warrants further attention, given
that the platform has increasingly been used to host communities and
conversations that have been subjected to moderation and flagging on
mainstream communications platforms]{.underline} (Murphy, 2021).

[Mis- and disinformation traverses platforms, borders, and languages,
and acquires cultural saliency as content moves through localized
information infrastructures. Understanding the spread and impact of
problematic information necessitates contextual grounding within the
socio-historical and political contexts of different communities. Mis-

historical and contemporary traumas, and root structures of
power]{.underline} (Reddi et al., 2021; Kuo & Marwick, 2021). Meanwhile,

# Framework

### Framework Exclusionary

#### Traditional framework interpretations are exclusionary 

**Peterson**, **University of Arizona Professor of International
Relations, 21**  (V Spike, 2021, Security Dialogue2021, Vol. 52(S)
17--27, \"Critical privilege studies: Making visible the reproduction of
racism in the everyday and international relations\",
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09670106211017369>, page 5,
accessed on 7-8-2022 hooch//cs)

Critical privilege studies foregrounds the invisibility of privilege as
a singularly powerful mechanism for reproducing dominant--subordinate
relations. On the one hand, invisibility 'permits' those with privilege
to be unaware of, habitually disregard, and/or deny responsibility for
how they systemically benefit from and variously contribute to
oppressive conditions. Reproducing this core problem is the common
assumption that harmful effects depend on willful intent; that
oppressive conditions are caused solely by 'bad' people consciously
intending to harm, discriminate, or exclude. This familiar reasoning
confuses intentions with consequences. **[In systems based on structural
inequality, simply adhering to societal norms -- acting as culturally
expected -- reproduces harms and oppression whether they are intended or
not]{.underline}** (Diangelo, 2018: xiii).6 **[This common assumption
has the insidious effect of encouraging those with privilege to presume
that they are neither 'being oppressive' nor implicated in reproducing
oppression unless the intention to harm (discriminate, exclude, oppress)
is present.]{.underline}** Most people -- and presumably critical
theorists -- deny this intention, [and, when a systemic sensibility is
absent, will ardently defend themselves against any claim of their
implication in or responsibility for perpetuating oppressive
conditions]{.underline}

On the other hand[, invisibility not only disables privileged group
awareness but also shapes how those without privilege understand and
respond to oppressive social practices]{.underline} -- [including
internalized inferiority as well as intense resentments and extensive
resistance]{.underline}. The point here is that **[ignorance to
privilege by those who have it shifts responsibility for explaining,
criticizing, and transforming oppression to those who suffer the most
from it and have the fewest resources to fight it.]{.underline}** We
have abundant evidence that [critics and protesters meet myriad forms of
resistance, including not only opposition to specific proposals for
change but also personal, sociocultural, and physical attacks on those
who persist in challenging the status quo]{.underline}.7

[These dynamics exemplify how structural positioning
matters]{.underline}: while **[those experiencing subordination cannot
afford to ignore oppressive conditions -- and pay numerous 'costs' for
protesting]{.underline}** [-- those with privilege enjoy what Allan
Johnson (2006: 22) calls the '**luxury of obliviousness' -- the
extraordinary advantage of being free to 'choose' whether and to what
extent they 'notice' injustice, engage in critical reflection, and/or
participate in ways that challenge status quo
inequalities.**]{.underline} I submit that **[this 'luxury' is
particularly present among multiply privileged academics and figures in
the 'masking' of power relations, 'acceptance' of racialized
inequalities, and persistent marginalization of dissenting, critical
voices]{.underline}**

The invisibility of power relations reflects processes of normalization,
the second key dimension of privilege. The argument here is that
**[qualities, characteristics, and priorities of dominant groups become
systemic norms that shape everyone's participation in unjust
systems]{.underline}** (Wildman, 1996). [This includes habituated ways
of identifying, thinking, and acting**, and written and unwritten
societal 'rules' that establish patterned social
expectations**]{.underline}. The latter constitute **['paths of least
resistance' that most of us follow most of the time, and mostly
unconsciously, because to do otherwise is literally 'unexpected' and
meets varying forms of resistance -- from curious stares, verbal
challenges, and threatening behavior to physical and even lethal
attacks]{.underline}** (Johnson, 2006: 80). **[In effect, what dominant
groups deem normal and preferred becomes the systemwide expectation and
the presumed standard of comparison]{.underline}** -- [the basis for
measuring success and failure -- for everyone.]{.underline}

### Framework -- White Epistemic Control

#### The aff's framework manifests as white epistemic control- regulating which knowledge models can or cannot be debated in an effort to maintain white denial of privilege

**Guerra, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro Senior Field
Assistant 21** (Lucas, 2021, Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S) 28--37

security studies\",

accessed on 7-9-2022, hooch//cs)

To sum up the contributions mentioned above, then, **[we have white
privilege as the central fulcrum of white racial identities and
whiteness as a system of power.]{.underline}** **[Regardless of white
people's 'racial awareness' and refusal to subscribe to social
structures of racial oppression, we unavoidably benefit from
them]{.underline}** (Mills, 1999). Moreover, [it is important to
highlight, with Barbara Applebaum (2010), that there is an indivisible
continuum between benefiting from and contributing to structural and
systemic racism.]{.underline} **[Willingly or not, when we enjoy white
privilege, we contribute to the maintenance of systems of racial
oppression.]{.underline}**

This is the reason why, according to Peggy McIntosh's (1988: 2)
oft-quoted work, **[white privilege may be described as 'an invisible
package of unearned assets that I can count on cashing in each day, but
about which I was "meant" to remain oblivious']{.underline}**. [We are
'meant to remain oblivious' to white privilege because it radically
disturbs white people's perceptions of ourselves, our accomplishments,
and what we believe we are entitled to**. Hence, to recognize white
privilege is to activate anxieties from our colonial past (Kilomba,
2019), to face the fact that many of our social, cultural, and economic
comforts are 'based on the legacy of the conquest'**]{.underline}
(Mills, 1999: 73). [Given the stressful implications of confronting
whiteness and white privilege**, white people invent a set of strategies
for preventing acknowledging our convenience with systems of racial
oppression. One of these 'strategies' is white epistemic control over
knowledge production**]{.underline} (Mills, 1999; Ribeiro, 2019a**[). By
epistemologically controlling which knowledges are authoritative and
which narratives are legitimate, whites can 'fit within a collective,
solid formation, a denial community, which denies and excludes from
reality everything deemed as unimportant']{.underline}** (Bento, 2014:
18).

Here, **[we come to the role of academia in the production and mediation
-- by exclusion -- of what one should consider legitimate knowledge and
important elements for analysis]{.underline}**. In this sense, Grada
**[Kilomba makes the point that 'the academic center is not a neutral
place. It is a white space where the privilege of speaking has been
denied to People of Color . . . a space of
v-i-o-l-e-n-c-e']{.underline}** (Kilomba, 2019: 51, emphasis added**[).
It is important to note that the reproduction of fundamentally racist
knowledge within academia is not simply a non-reflected consequence of
the dominant whiteness in this space. Rather, we need to insist on the
fact that we, white researchers, despite our self-perception as racially
aware and anti-racist, are constantly benefiting from -- and therefore
contributing to -- the structural and systemic racism that allows our
voices to be heard in positions of authority]{.underline}** (Applebaum,
2010; Garner, 2007; Howard, 2004; Kilomba, 2019; Ribeiro, 2019a).

**[This is especially important in discussions on international
relations]{.underline}** -- and, by extension, **[security
studies]{.underline}** and critical security studies -- a **[discipline
founded amid Great Powers colonialism that reproduces racist traces of
the modern international in most of its analysis and theoretical
frameworks]{.underline}** (Anievas et al., 2015; Persaud and Sajed,
2018; Sabaratnam, 2020). As Sankaran Krishna (2001) pointed out some
years ago**[, it is only by assuming a systematic 'politics of
forgetting' towards its racist and colonial foundations that
international relations may sustain its legitimacy as an academic
discipline.]{.underline}** It **[is important to highlight that this
'politics of forgetting' enacts violent epistemicidal practices against
subaltern peoples and their systems of knowledge]{.underline}**

#### To "Study" is the violence which enables sustained discrimination and manifests as anti-blackness

It is perhaps the most harmless of the 'three little words', but
'**[studies' contains all we need to know of hierarchies and cuts -- of
the 'human' from the world, of the knowing subject from the object to be
known and 'studied'.]{.underline}** [**For** critical]{.underline}
**[security studies, the study itself is already the violence that
enables the violence of 'sustained discrimination', the violence that we
are told is both 'invisible and acceptable']{.underline}** (Security
Dialogue, 2020). **[Study is a practice of the world of the subject, the
world of critical security, the world of anti-Blackness.]{.underline}**
Yes, 'study' as a concept could be reclaimed for a world beyond
anti-Blackness, but this would not be the '[study]{.underline}' that
[demarcates one 'field' from another.]{.underline} Fred Moten and
Stefano Harney (2013: 118), for example**[, talk of study as the
disruption of the grounds that would enable the study of 'studies'. This
form of study is the refusal of the settled order of academia, the
flight from the institutional demands of disciplinarity, the embrace of
dissonance instead of clarity]{.underline}**. **[Study is the reason for
the abolition of critical security studies, the reason why you would
leave the world of policy and academia, not why you would seek to expand
it.]{.underline}** **[Study is the work and the interaction and the care
that is in the world. 'Study' is not the product of critical security
studies; it can only be what critical security studies sets itself
against, to carve itself out of, to separate itself from.]{.underline}**
[Critical security studies can no more undertake this form of study than
it can engage with 'questions of race and racism'.]{.underline}

### AT: Policymaking Good - Research

#### The affirmatives research model manifests as a eurocentric project which upholds the white supremacist structuring of the global system

**Guerra, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro Senior Field
Assistant, 21** (Lucas, 2021, Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S) 28--37

**[We live in a world which has been foundationally shaped for the past
five hundred years by the realities of European domination and the
gradual consolidation of global white supremacy.]{.underline}** In
making the above claim, the Jamaican Black philosopher **[Charles Mills
calls attention to a distinctive feature of modernity: the structuring
of a white supremacist global system, a process advanced by Europe
through colonialism and genocide against the rest of the
world]{.underline}**. [This is not a trivial matter, nor an already
overcome legacy from the past]{.underline}. On the contrary, **[Mills
(1999: 13--14) argues that the sociopolitical, moral, economic,
cultural, and epistemic racial hierarchies established with modernity
still resonate within contemporary politics, reproduced in a 'racial
polity, a racial state, and a racial juridical system']{.underline}**
**[that 'maintain and reproduce this racial order, securing the
privileges and advantages of the full white citizens and maintaining the
subordination of nonwhites'.]{.underline}**

One of the consequences of **[this encompassing racial system of power
is that it takes whiteness as the natural and universal condition of
humanity]{.underline}** (Kilomba, 2019; Mills, 1999; Ribeiro, 2019a).
Hence, **[whiteness is 'neither problematized nor particularized within
discourses on race because it assumes a status of
normalcy']{.underline}** (Hayes and Juárez, 2009: 731). As the
Panamanian philosopher Linda Alcoff (2005: 205) puts it, '**[given its
simultaneous invisibility and universality, whiteness has until recently
enjoyed the unchallenged hegemony that any invisible contender in a ring
full of visible bodies would experience]{.underline}**'[. Thus, it
remains, in the words of Ruth Frankenberg (1993), an unmarked and
unnamed dominant position in racial systems of oppression (see also
Ribeiro, 2019a, 2019b).]{.underline}

Nonetheless, Black Brazilian psychologist Cida **[Bento (2014) reminds
us that whiteness is oftentimes hidden, but always strongly
operating]{.underline}**. In this sense, **[critical race theorists
argue that whiteness operates as 'the fulcrum of power
relations']{.underline}** (Garner, 2007: 43**[) in modern societies
structured by racism and racial privilege]{.underline}** (Applebaum,
2010; Ribeiro, 2019b). [Hence, whiteness is a location of 'structural
advantag]{.underline}e' (Frankenberg, 1993: 1), [one that invests those
positioned in it with the notion of full entitlement and belonging
regarding economic, political, and social]{.underline} privileges and
spaces (Harris, 1993; Kilomba, 2019; McIntosh, 1988).

Thus, as conceived here, whiteness has nothing to do with any
fundamental biological or genetic truth. Nor is it about individual
racial/cultural identity. As Noel Ignatiev (1997: 1) acutely puts it,
'whiteness has nothing to do with culture and everything to do with
social position. It is nothing but a reflection of privilege and exists
for no reason other than to defend it. Without the privileges attached
to it, the white race would not exist'. Ignatiev's quote points directly
to the dimension of material structural privilege inherently attached to
white racial identity. As David Roediger (2002: 23) adds, rather than
biological or cultural, 'white identity is decisively shaped by the
exercise of power and the expectation of advantages in acquiring
property'.

In her groundbreaking and now classic work, [Cheryl Harris (1993) also
emphasizes the material and structural dimension of
whiteness]{.underline}. She argues that, **[in the USA, whiteness became
by law a position of social status and privilege, legitimizing the
property obtained through centuries of white colonial expropriation of
indigenous lands and Black enslaved work.]{.underline}** As Aníbal
Quijano (2000) and Charles **[Mills (1999) remind us, this is not an
exclusive feature of US history. Whiteness as a position of dominance in
racial social hierarchies is a structural part in the ordering of the
modern capitalist world economy (and modernity itself) as a
whole]{.underline}**. According to the particularities of each national
context, then, w**[hiteness became 'a form of racialized privilege
ratified in law. Material privileges attendant to being white inhered in
the status of being white. . . . \[R\]elative white privilege was
legitimated as the status quo' in modern polities around the
world]{.underline}**

# Answers To

hooch//cs)

[We have seen above that disavowal operates on the basis of stipulating
that the problem of race and racism is one that can be located in the
past, intimating that the problem is a difficult one of 'spectres' or
legacies that must and can be overcome.]{.underline} **[This is possible
because the assumption is that questions of race are somehow separable
from the field of critical security studies itself, rather than
constitutive of it.]{.underline}** [The successful accomplishment of
disavowal, then, enables a focus upon how critical security studies
might move forward]{.underline}. **[This leap, we argue, is a
displacement that then puts questions of the future of critical security
studies at the forefront of concern]{.underline}**. [The displacement
accomplishes the inversing of the problematic**: critical security
studies is now the solution rather than the problem.**]{.underline}
**[The precondition for reparative work is the disavowal that race and
racism are inextricably entangled with critical security
studies]{.underline}**. **[The shift of displacement is the move to
reparation, the imaginary of an anti- or non-racist critical security
studies]{.underline}**.

**[The problem with this move of displacement is that the
ethico-political stance of reparation is necessarily an affirmative
one]{.underline}**. As Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (2003: 150--151) suggests,
[it is through this displacement that we can learn from the 'ways selves
and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a
culture -- even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to
sustain them'.]{.underline} As Tiffany Lethabo King powerfully argues[,
while it is the case that reading 'for what is generative and provides
openings' (King, 2019: 230n74) is vital for coalition and collaboration,
reparative work advocated in LGBT and queer theory presupposes the
positionality of a shared humanist sexual subject position.]{.underline}
As Fred Moten (2018: 11--12) notes in his essay on race and the work of
Levinas, **[the reparative stance of being 'open to the world' or
'available to the world' can only work as a critical project for those
for whom the world is accessible in these ways]{.underline}**. [For
those structurally excluded from this political ontology of the subject,
this openness would be critical **only insofar as relationality is
understood to be an expression of power, structured by the givenness of
a transcendental subjectivity that the black cannot have but by which
the black can be had; a structural position that he or she cannot take
but by which he or she can be taken**]{.underline}

### AT: Perm - Racism

#### Perm fails under the weight of the racism which is amalgamated within critical security scholarship

Relations, and Chipato**, **University of Ottawa CIPS postdoctoral

hooch//cs)

**[Any project of reparative work for generative ethico-political
openings would have to be undertaken after the abolition or dismantling
of critical security studies, not as a substitute for this, displacing
the problem to that of the repair of the disciplinary
field]{.underline}**. **[Reparative work proffered from within a system
where race is not merely the 'oil' in the engine but the engine itself
offers little hope of real change.]{.underline}** [How can critical
security studies offer a space for a new antiracist political ethics,
from within the wider 'prison of colonial modernity']{.underline}
(Blaney and Tickner, 2017)? Surely**[, if reparative work is to be
undertaken, it should be carried out on the terms of those who are
wronged, rather than on the grounds of the perpetrator of the
offence.]{.underline}** If **[critical security studies exists on the
ground of the 'human', as a science of the humanity from which Blackness
has always been excluded, then it cannot ameliorate the oppression that
was required to clear that ground]{.underline}** (Wynter, 2003).
Instead, we might follow Alexander Weheliye (2014: 137) in arguing that
**[humanity, the idea of the 'human', can only be overhauled from
without, transformed by those who, he argues, 'live behind the veil of
the permanent state of exception']{.underline}**. Thus, we might argue
that **[reparation ultimately leads us back to subjection (see
Coulthard, 2007: 453). 'Questions of race and racism' are not the
spectre haunting critical security studies, they are its life blood, its
arteries and the muscles that power it.]{.underline}** **[Critical
security studies can have no reparative access to 'questions of race and
racism' no matter how hard or how genuinely it tries]{.underline}**.
'[Questions of race and racism' are what enable the cuts and binaries,
the world, the subjects, the concerns, the practices, the methods, the
understandings of critical security studies]{.underline}. Critical.
Security. Studies. [What is it about these three words, singularly,
together, in whatever order, that could make anyone think, in today's
world, there was a way beyond their imbrications in 'questions of race
and racism'? Critical of what? On what grounds? Security of what? On
what grounds? Study of what? On what grounds**? Answer: the grounds of
anti-Blackness or 'questions of race and racism'.**]{.underline}

This article has illustrated that cla**[ssic securitization theory is
structured not only by Eurocentrism, but also by civilizationism,
methodological whiteness, and antiblack racism]{.underline}**. This is
evident in its conception of politics, borrowed from [Arendt, which it
defines as a sphere of (white) civilized dialogue where reason triumphs
over irrational securitizations.]{.underline} **[This perspective is
only made possible by ignoring colonial history, ongoing
(settler-)colonial relations, and the racial violence of normal liberal
politics]{.underline}**. **[Securitization theory's racism is also
evident in its methodology, which examines securitizing speech acts in
order to defend this (European, civilized) 'normal
politics'.]{.underline}** **[Under cover of ostensibly neutral terms,
securitization normatively prioritizes the defense of order over
justice, positioning the securitization theorist as the defender of
(white) civilized politics against (racialized) 'primal
anarchy']{.underline}**. We have further demonstrated the role of
antiblack thought in securitization theory: its racist imaginaries of
Africa serve as an indispensable foil, **[setting up a contrast between
normal politics and securitization.]{.underline}**

One question beyond the scope of this article is **[whether this is
similarly true of 'second-generation' and more empirical applications of
securitization theory -- or, indeed, the mere use of the word
'securitization']{.underline}**. **[Postcolonial literature has long
deliberated whether it is possible to rework theories built on racist
precepts]{.underline}**. For example, [vigorous debate has surrounded
whether the works of Marx (Coulthard, 2014; Rao, 2017; Robinson, 1983)
or Foucault (Mbembe, 2003; Stoler, 1995; Thobani, 2007) can be adapted
and made to work for anti-racist/anti-colonial purposes]{.underline}.
**[Are there 'reparative possibilities' (Sedgwick, 1997; in relation to
international relations,]{.underline}** see Rao, 2017) [for classic
securitization theory? Can it excise or surmount its racist
foundations]{.underline}? **[Our analysis suggests that securitization
theory's racism is not an incidental feature, nor 'merely' a matter of
(empirical) application.]{.underline}** Rather, **[it is baked into
securitization theory's conceptual apparatus and, in particular, its
core concepts of politics and security.]{.underline}** [These problems
cannot be remedied by applying classic securitization theory to
non-Western spaces (as typically suggested by critics of its
Eurocentrism), **or by simply adding race or colonialism to its
accounts**]{.underline}. **[The retention of securitization theory's
concepts and methods leads to a primary focus on instances of overtly
racist speech acts. Global racism is then treated as a matter of mere
language.]{.underline}** [This elides the constitutive role of racist
and colonial relations of force and expropriation in the making of the
modern order, including ongoing security projects]{.underline} (see
Howell and Richter-Montpetit, 2019).

[Once classic securitization theory is stripped of its racist conceptual
and methodological apparatus, including its concepts of 'normal
politics', its conservative deployment of speech act theory, its view of
excessive securitization as threatening a racially encoded lower level
of civilization, its faith in the social contract, and so
on]{.underline}, **[there is very little left]{.underline}**. Perhaps
**[what remains is simply the word 'securitization']{.underline}**.
**[But even this word is potentially problematic]{.underline}**,
**[because inherent in it is a temporal move from normal politics
towards the (exceptional) violence of security. Authors attempting to
recuperate the term 'securitization' must take care not to indulge in
white nostalgia for a better]{.underline}**, [more innocent time: a time
that does not exist for those who have been subject to colonialism or
the racial contract on scales from the local to the global -- that is to
say, the majority of the world's people]{.underline}. **[Such a
recuperative intellectual project, if at all possible, has yet to be
articulated]{.underline}**.

### AT: Permutation - Ontology

#### Discipline Turn -- Permutation cannot access the teleological suspension of the discipline itself, including the plan cannot challenge the ontological underpinnings

**Coleman, University of Sussex International Relations Professor, 21**
(Lara Montesinos, "Racism! What do you mean? From Howell and
Richter-Montpetit's underestimation of the problem, towards situating
security through struggle", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S) 69-77,
EBSCO, GDI access 7/12/22)

How might we move past this? **[It will not do]{.underline}**, as Howell
and Richter-Montpetit (2020: 17) empha- size, **[to simply 'add race and
colonialism to existing conceptual apparatuses'.]{.underline}** However,
there are also limits to what can be done by seeking to dismantle those
conceptual apparatuses by reference to canonical texts on race and
coloniality, without attention to the ontological assumptions that make
it seem natural to centre security. **[We should be wary of any
project]{.underline}** of 'decolonizing security studies' **[that seeks
to work decolonial insights into the fabric of the discipline in this
way]{.underline}** (e.g. Adamson, 2020). 'That knowledge has been
colonized', Lewis Gordon (2011: 95) reminds us, 'raises the question of
whether it was ever free'. Given the acrimony that has animated
responses to Howell and Richter-Montpetit, it is worth emphasizing that
**[the epistemic conditions in which all of us work are confined within
institutionalized parameters and that the process of inquiry always
means seeking to work past these]{.underline}**. 'Any discipline or
generated system for the organization of real- ity faces the problem of
having to exceed the scope of its object of inquiry', Gordon writes.
'There is, in other words, always more to and of reality. Failure to
appreciate reality sometimes takes the form of recoiling from it. . . .
The discipline becomes, in solipsistic fashion, the world' (Gordon,
2011:98). **[This is the challenge for any attempt to undermine the
implicit ontological assumptions that focus attention onto particular
objects of study, to the exclusion of ways in which humanity is
hierarchically ordered and disciplined within extractive-productive
relations predicated upon colo- niality and racism]{.underline}**.
**[Taking that challenge seriously requires not just asking what
scholarship on race and coloniality has to say to the discipline, but
something more like]{.underline}** what Gordon (2011: 99) calls **[a
'teleological suspension of disciplines' that is itself'an epistemic
decolonial act'. Otherwise, there is a risk that the racial foundations
of security are acknowledged, but without being situated within these
wider dynamics of extraction and production, coloniality and
racism.]{.underline}** **[It is necessary to de-centre security, to
address the relations between security and political economy, between
self- declared means of managing risk, threat or vulnerability and
technologies through which 'normal politics' is produced and
contained]{.underline}**. **[While the latter might look benign, they
nevertheless serve to discipline humanity]{.underline}** (or regulate
admission to the category of human) **[within acceptable parameters for
the continuation of capitalist extraction]{.underline}**.

ground of the 'human', as a science of the humanity from which Blackness
has always been excluded, then it cannot ameliorate the oppression that
was required to clear that ground]{.underline}** (Wynter, 2003).
Instead, we might follow Alexander Weheliye (2014: 137) in arguing that
**[humanity, the idea of the 'human', can only be overhauled from
without, transformed by those who, he argues, 'live behind the veil of
the permanent state of exception']{.underline}**. Thus, we might argue
that **[reparation ultimately leads us back to subjection (see
Coulthard, 2007: 453). 'Questions of race and racism' are not the
spectre haunting critical security studies, they are its life blood, its
arteries and the muscles that power it.]{.underline}** **[Critical
security studies can have no reparative access to 'questions of race and
racism' no matter how hard or how genuinely it tries]{.underline}**.
'[Questions of race and racism' are what enable the cuts and binaries,
the world, the subjects, the concerns, the practices, the methods, the
understandings of critical security studies]{.underline}. Critical.
Security. Studies. [What is it about these three words, singularly,
together, in whatever order, that could make anyone think, in today's
world, there was a way beyond their imbrications in 'questions of race
and racism'? Critical of what? On what grounds? Security of what? On
what grounds? Study of what? On what grounds**? Answer: the grounds of
anti-Blackness or 'questions of race and racism'.**]{.underline}

### AT: Perm -- Do Both (Disinformation)

#### Addressing identity propaganda requires centering social issues to address the politics of power, not just adding identity as a coding category.

**Reddi, Kuo and Kreiss, University Of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

Postdoctoral Research Fellow, and Principal Researcher, 21**

As such, [the concept of identity propaganda]{.underline} usefully adds
to the distinctions that researchers [can draw between the types of
manipulative appeals that political actors make for strategic
gain]{.underline}. For example, an emerging line of work has clearly
demonstrated how [accounting for identity, and especially race and
ethnicity, is central to understanding disinformation.]{.underline} Deen
Freelon et al.'s (2020) computational analysis of 5.2 million tweets by
the Russian Internet Research Agency [during the 2016 US presidential
election revealed that bots presenting as Black activists received the
highest levels of engagement through retweets, likes, and
replies.]{.underline} As Freelon et al. (2020) conclude, "[race is a
critical variable in the analysis of disinformation uptake]{.underline}
and should be a key focus area in future research on the topic." [These
findings]{.underline}, among others (Daniels, 2009; Ong and Cabañes,
2019; DiResta et al., 2018), [speak to the need for the concept of
identity propaganda as a means to **center questions of social and
political identities alongside analysis of power,** **not just include
them as a coding category**. This follows other work that has found
identity-based differences and structural antagonisms to be at the
forefront of political and social life, particularly in information
processes]{.underline} (Flores- Yeffa et al., 2011; Hesse, 2016 Mason,
2018; Murthy and Sharma, 2019).

[While not all identity propaganda focuses on constructing and
exploiting racial differences, race functions as the dominant means of
organizing societies]{.underline} (Hall, 1999; Hesse, 2016). [The
construction of race continues to be a strategy to create and maintain
the position of dominant, ascendant, and voiced groups against that of
subordinate, marginalized, and unvoiced groups]{.underline} (Hall,
1999). For example, as we detail below, to understand Kamala Harris's
identities as Black and Asian against the backdrop of white supremacy,
researchers must analyze the triangulation of propagandistic racial
positionings along two axes of "superior or inferior" and "insider or
foreigner" that relatively valorize or ostracize Black and Asian
communities (Kim, 1999). Often, these racial positionings are
constructed as being at odds with one another. [The model minority myth,
a racial narrative that describes Asian Americans as hard-working and
high-achieving, has often been used as a "weapon in the war against
Black America" to deflect demands for racial justice and sow discord
between the two racial groups]{.underline} (Prashad, 2000: 6).
Furthermore, [this myth also serves as a way that marginalized groups
are rewarded for upholding existing racial hierarchies and assimilating
to whiteness.]{.underline} [This is the way that dominant racial
structures become reified: "discursive technologies of power encourage
affiliation with dominant discourses" through forms of "identification
and repudiation"]{.underline} (Tomlinson, 2013: 994). [White supremacy
foments a competitive politics of scarcity over seemingly limited
resources.]{.underline} In the next section, we develop these ideas
further as we apply our conceptual framework of identity propaganda to
cases concerning Kamala Harris and discuss different narrative forms.

#### Conventional disinformation debunking efforts focus on individual identity to sow division and draw attention away from combating violent power structures.

[As with essentializing narratives, strategic campaigns and appeals that
contest the authenticity of an individual's or group's identity are
difficult to analyze under the standard umbrella of mis- or
disinformation because they often lack a factual basis]{.underline},
[referring more to normative constructions of difference.]{.underline}
[The authenticity of someone's claim to racial and ethnic identity
(particularly in the case of a multiracial person) or gender identity is
subjective and layered, and cannot be assessed as true or
false.]{.underline} [Authenticating narratives reduce identity back down
to the individual, drawing attention away from structural formations of
power, whereas individual people, regardless of identity, may still
align with dominant interests and the preservation of existing
hierarchies of power.]{.underline} An identity propaganda framework
enables researchers to examine these claims through the lens of both
historical race relations and constructions, as well as structures of
power behind these appeals.

Returning to the example of Harris, it is no surprise that [right-wing
narratives sought to elevate Harris's Indian identity to question her
Blackness]{.underline}. In essence, [the claim is that Harris cannot
call herself Black if she is reaping the benefits of her Asian
background that scholars have argued to hold a higher place in America's
racial order]{.underline} (Bonilla Silva and Glover, 2004; Kim, 1999).
This is [the utilization of a white racial frame (or model minority
myth)]{.underline} that [pits Asian Americans against Black Americans,
where structural racism and "the ordering power of white supremacy
forces groups against each other"]{.underline} (Washington, 2017: 100).
Furthermore, [Harris's]{.underline} Brahmin (upper caste) [background
structurally positions her family for access to upward mobility and the
ability to achieve an "American Dream" success story.]{.underline} [The
narrativization of her successes continue to legitimate the hegemonic
"model minority" myth of immigrant uplift, as well as "authenticates"
her Indian-ness in accordance with dominant frameworks of
power.]{.underline} Scholar Nitasha Sharma (2020), for instance, points
out that Harris's advantageous Brahmin background "overlays Indians'
pride in her." At same time, [upper-class and caste Indian immigrants'
embrace of model minority narratives sow divisions among communities of
color, particularly Black communities, who this narrative is wielded
against.]{.underline}

#### Identity Propaganda creates essentializing narratives that force the performance of identity through the perspective of dominant groups.

[Harris's intersecting identities as a Black woman centrally feature
within essentializing identity propaganda campaigns]{.underline}. Soon
after Kamala Harris was announced as Joe Biden's running mate in August
2020, a slew of racist and sexist identity propaganda became prevalent
from the right. These were [essentializing narratives]{.underline} that
[exploited generalized stereotypes of non-dominant groups.]{.underline}
"Essentialism," as we use it, refers to [the "attribution of a fixed
essence"]{.underline} (Grosz, 1990: 334) [on an individual's or group's
identity, be it racial or ethnic, gender, or class identities, or a
combination of multiple identities.]{.underline} Several [articles
portrayed Harris as sexually promiscuous, raising unfounded questions
about her previous professional and personal relationship with famous
San Francisco Democratic politician Willie Brown]{.underline} (Casiano,
2019; Post, 2019). [Right-wing figures]{.underline} such as Tomi Lahren
[stated that Harris slept her "way to the top," and the "Joe and the
Hoe" slogan]{.underline} (a portmanteau of "Joe" and the slang term for
prostitute "Hoe") [was popularized by rightwing celebrities]{.underline}
such as Rush Limbaugh and NBA photographer Bill Baptist (Levenson, 2020;
Niemietz, 2020). [The circulation of a slogan such as "Joe and the Hoe"
trades on the cultural availability of essentializing tropes of Black
women as hypersexualized]{.underline} (Noble, 2013; hooks, 1992) [as
well as the convergence of anti-Blackness, whorephobia, and
misogyny.]{.underline} [Another stream of racist and sexist identity
propaganda on the right that has attempted to undermine Harris is the
"angry Black women" trope. Former President Trump characterized Harris
as "unlikable" and called her a "monster]{.underline}" (Summers, 2020).
[White right-wing media personalities]{.underline} such as Tucker
Carlson, who has scant regard for pronouncing her name correctly (a form
of "othering") (Sullivan, 2020), [promoted the idea that "she'll
bulldoze her elderly, sentimental boss" with her hidden and radical
agenda for the presidency]{.underline} (Astor, 2020) [that will take
power away from white people]{.underline}.

All of [these examples of identity propaganda reflect how communities of
color are often reduced to essentializing assumptions about cultural and
social traits.]{.underline} For example, [while women are sexualized and
objectified by a dominant masculine culture]{.underline} (Szymanski et
al., 2011), [Black women in particular are disproportionately targets of
the essentialization of their sexuality]{.underline} (Epstein et al.,
2017; Holmes, 2016; hooks, 1992; Pilgrim, 2002; Woodard and Mastin,
2005). [This tendency to essentialize certain identities and cultures
counters the arguments of scholars that identity is ever changing based
on numerous contextual factors]{.underline} (Bhabha, 1994; Hall, 1994).
[Like the othering narrative, essentializing narratives provide the
purveyors of identity propaganda with culturally-available lines of
attack to exploit in the attempt to subvert those with marginalized
identities. Where othering narratives reinforce a divide between a
dominant center and subordinate others, essentializing narratives make
use of stereotypes of non-dominant groups.]{.underline} In this, it is
different from attempts by non-dominant groups to utilize "strategic
essentialism" to gain political power (Lowe and Yuk-Ha Tsang, 2018).
[Marginalized individuals and groups are expected to both respond to
these tropes and perform their identities in essentialist terms mediated
through the perspective and power of dominant groups.]{.underline}

[Accounting for essentializing narratives would greatly
benefit]{.underline} researchers [analyzing the structure of mis- and
disinformation and propaganda in leading them to consider who and what
groups are the targets and audiences of these symbolic attacks and why
they take the form that they do. It is not a coincidence that white
candidates, such as Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton, are unlikely to be
referred to as "hoes." Tropes such as these capitalize on non-dominant
racial and gender categories and pre-existing social stigmas to
contribute to the subordination of Black women.]{.underline} Kamala
Harris's experience as a Black woman politician is a "prime example" of
the exploitation of intersecting marginalized identities (Astor, 2020)
in the attempt to de-legitimate her for higher office.

## Case Outweighs

### AT: Nuclear War Impacts

#### Nuclear discourse flows neg- whitewashed analysis obscures the fact that their impacts are a manifestation of anti-blackness

**Thompson, Reporter and author, 18** (Nicole Thompson, 4-23-2018,
 Racebaitr, \"Why I will not allow the fear of a nuclear attack to be
white-washed\", https://racebaitr.com/2018/04/06/2087/ accessed on
7-12-2022, hooch//cs)

I shook my head, willing the meal to be over, and was grateful when the
check arrived just as someone was asking me about my hair. My thinking
wasn't all too different from Michael Harriot's 'Why Black America Isn't
Worried About the Upcoming Nuclear Holocaust." While the meal was partly
pleasant, [I departed thinking, **"fear of nuclear demolition is just
some white shit."**]{.underline}

Sadly, [that thought would not last long]{.underline}.

I still vibe with Harriot's statement, "[Black people have lived under
the specter of having our existence erased on a white man's whim since
we stepped onto the shore at Jamestown Landi]{.underline}ng." However, a
friend---a Black friend---ignited my nuclear paranoia by sharing
theories about when it might happen and who faced the greatest threat.
In an attempt to ease my friend's fear, I leaned in to listen but
accidentally toppled down the rabbit hole too. I forked through curated
news feeds. I sifted through "fake news," "actual news," and foreign
news sources**[. Suddenly, an idea took root: nuclear strike would
disproportionately impact Black people, brown people, and low-income
individuals]{.underline}**.

[North Korea won't target the plain sight racists of
Portland]{.underline}, Oregon, [the violently microaggressive liberals
of the rural Northwest, or the white-hooded klansmen of Diamondhead,
Mississippi]{.underline}. No, under the instruction of the supreme
leader Kim Jong-un, **[North Korea will likely strike densely populated
urban areas, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., and New York
City]{.underline}**. [These locations stand-out as targets for a nuclear
strike because they are densely populated U.S. population
centers]{.underline}. **[Attacking the heart of the nation or populous
cities would translate to more casualties. With that in mind, it's not
lost on me that the most populous cities in the United States boast
sizeable diverse populations, or more plainly put: Black
populations.]{.underline}**

This shit stresses me out! There's a creeping chill that follows me, a
silent alarm that rings each time my Google alert chimes letting me know
that Donald Trump has yet again provoked Kim Jong-Un, a man who
allegedly killed his very own uncle. I've grown so pressed by the idea
of nuclear holocaust that my partner and I started gathering
non-perishables, candlesticks, a hand-crank radio, and other must-buy
items that can be banked in a shopping cart. [The practice of preparing
for a nuclear holocaust sometimes feels comical, **particularly when
acknowledging that there has long been a war on Black people in this
country.**]{.underline}

Blackness is bittersweet in flavor. We are blessed with the melanized
skin, the MacGyver-like inventiveness of our foremothers, and our
blinding brightness---but **[the anti-blackness that we experience is
also blinding as well as stifling.]{.underline}** We are [**stuck by
rigged systems, punished with the prison industrial complex, housing
discrimination, pay discrimination, and worse**. We get side-eyes from
strangers when we're "loitering," and the police will pull us over for
driving "too fast" in a residential neighborhood.]{.underline} We get
murdered for holding cell phones while standing in our grandmother's
backyard.

[The racism that strung up our ancestors, kept them sequestered to the
back of the bus and kept them in separate and unequal schools still
lives]{.underline}. **[It lives]{.underline}**, and it's more palpable
than dormant. To me, this means one thing: Trump's [America isn't an
unfortunate circumstance, it's a homecoming event that's hundreds of
years in the making, no matter how many times my white friends' say,
"He's not my president."]{.underline}

In light of this homecoming, **[we now flirt with a new, larger fear of
a Black genocide]{.underline}**. **[America has always worked towards
Black eradication through a steady stream of life-threatening
inequality, but nuclear war on American soil would be
swift]{.underline}**. And for this reason **[I've grown tired of
whiteness being at the center of the nuclear conversation. The
race-neutral approach to the dialogue, and a tendency to continue to
promote the idea that missiles will land in suburban and rural
backyards, instead of inner-city playgrounds, is false.]{.underline}**

"The Day After," the iconic, highest-rated television film in history,
aired November 20, 1983. More than 100 million people tuned in to watch
a film postulating a war between the Soviet Union and the United States.
The film, which would go on to affect President Ronald Reagan and
policymakers' nuclear intentions, shows the "true effects of nuclear war
on average American citizens." The Soviet-targeted areas featured in the
film include Higginsville, Kansas City, Sedalia, Missouri, as well as El
Dorado Springs, Missouri. They depict the destruction of the central
United States, and viewers watch as full-scale nuclear war transforms
middle America into a burned wasteland. Yet unsurprisingly, the
devastation from the attack is completely white-washed, leaving out the
more likely victims which are the more densely populated (Black) areas.

[Death tolls would be high for white populations, yes**, but large-scale
losses of Black and brown folks would outpace that number, due to
placement and poverty**]{.underline}. [That number would be pushed
higher by limited access to premium health care, wealth, and
resources.]{.underline} **[The effects of radiation sickness, burns,
compounded injuries, and malnutrition would throttle Black and brown
communities and would mark us for generations. I]{.underline}**t's for
that reason that we have to do more to foster disaster preparedness
among Black people where we can. [Black people deserve the space to
explore nuclear unease, even if we have competing threats, anxieties,
and worries.]{.underline}

Jacqui Patterson, Director of the Environmental and Climate Justice
Initiative, once stated:

[**African American communities are disproportionately vulnerable to and
impacted by natural (and unnatural) catastrophes**. Our socio-economic
vulnerability is based on multiple factors including our lack of wealth
to cushion us, our disproportionate representation in lower quality
housing stock, and our relative lack of mobility, etc]{.underline}.

### AT: Extinction First 

#### Racism should be treated as an existential risk\-\--eliminating personhood causes psychic trauma and is the basis for literal extermination

Education and Communities, 4/20/17, \"Rethinking Existential Threats and
Education\", Competence Based Education and Training (CBET) and the End

\*BAME = Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic

After Marxism, [the]{.underline} second **[existential
threat]{.underline}** is one [of **negation** and **elimination** of
**the subject**]{.underline} and here I shall consider conceptions of
this from CRT and black existentialism.

Various contemporary educational theories consider the equity and social
justice implications of different forms of education with regard to
race. The work of Sleeter and Grant (2007) makes the ethical and
pragmatic case for multicultural social justice as a key value of
education. This has been followed in contemporary work that attempts to
consider the various dimensions of social justice. For example, Bhopal
and Shain (2014), consider the twin axis of recognition and
redistribution as goals of education. Other work examines the role of
social distancing from the 'Other' by white students as a dynamic
process in which Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) and
working-class students are disadvantaged. In many ways denial of social
justice in terms of lack of resources, recognition or access to social
space can be considered to be a form of dehumanisation. However, whilst
work on social justice and education might consider the lack of humanity
in these systems of oppression (applying concepts such as 'bare life',
Lewis 2006; or 'othering' Lebowitz 2016) they do not consider directly
existential threats. [**Threats to humanity** on the basis of
**difference** may arise from **totalitarianism** as much as through
**war** and threats to **the environment**. The various **genocides**
which have taken place throughout human history have often had a
**racial**, or ethnic, cleansing **purpose** to them. They have been
eugenic threats that are based upon spurious ideas of genetic and moral
superiority. Writers on race from Fanon to Du Bois have considered that
the threat posed to racial groups may be **existential** and that
**there is a short step from psychic, to real extermination**. The
negation of individuals]{.underline} through economic, social and
psychological processes [allows for their physical
extermination]{.underline}. Du Bois (2014) deals explicitly with
existential threat in his short story 'The Comet' where humanity is
almost wiped out by a threat from space, leaving only a small number of
people to carry on. As one of the survivors of the comet is an African
American, this leads Du Bois to consider the state of race relations in
the USA. The implication of the story is that the existential threat of
the comet (which allows the African American character to live in a
world entirely free of racial prejudice) allows release from [the
existential threat of eugenic attitudes]{.underline}. Building on Du
Bois, in other work (Preston 2012), I have considered the ways in which
[preparation for threats, including existential threats such as
**pandemics** and **nuclear war**, has been in many ways **eugenic** in
that it **prioritises** the **survival of some** more than others based
upon criteria which include **race** and ethnicity]{.underline} (Preston
2012). [Preparing for disasters and emergencies often prioritises the
interests of white people above those of other ethnic minorities. One
reason for this is **tacit intentionality** which means that
policymakers and practitioners **do not consider** human **diversity**
in considering how people may respond to disaster. **Policy is** often
**biased** as policymakers expect that people will be 'like me'
which]{.underline} (at least [in the]{.underline} UK and
[USA]{.underline}) [means they will often be white, middle-class,
educated, English-speaking men. In planning for threats, there will be
various ways in which such biases are included. For example, they may
not consider publishing advice in a number of languages, the resources
necessary to survive a disaster, the mobility of people and the
attitudes of emergency responders. This is unwitting prejudice in that
by not considering diversity they are actually making it **less likely**
for BAME people to **survive**, or protect themselves against, the
disaster.]{.underline}

Although these biases may lead to a gradient in terms of survival by
different groups in a disaster, they do not appear to relate to
existential threat. However, [existential threat can be interpreted in a
different way in perspectives from critical whiteness studies and
CRT.]{.underline}

In critical whiteness studies, [whiteness is]{.underline} taken to be
not a racial identity, but rather [a system of power and
oppression]{.underline} (Leonardo 2009). Whiteness was created as an
identity not simply as a mode of social classification but as a way of
exploiting and controlling others. There are obviously periods in
history where this was objectively the case. During slavery in the USA,
for example, whiteness was used as a means to distinguish between those
people who had the right to own property (whites) and those who could
not (Africans), Moreover, whiteness was the obverse of property in that
only Africans could 'be' assets or property. Enslaved Africans were
therefore treated as property and did not have access to the basic
rights which would constitute humanity in American society (such as
access to education, the right to own property, the right to decide who
they should have relationships with). There are obviously parallels
between this experience and holocaust when Jewish people (and other
individuals) were dehumanised by the Nazis and denied access to basic
resources. During imperialism there was also a period whereby other
races were categorised to be less worthy than white people and this
provided the justification for colonial control, exploitation and often
extermination.

Advocates of whiteness studies go further than this and consider that
whiteness is not merely a past system of oppression, but [a continuing
system of **white supremacy**]{.underline} (Leonardo 2009). [The economy
and society is comprised in such a way that white people will usually
benefit, and BAME people will usually not. This is not only an economic
and social system but also a **psychological system** whereby
**existence** as a **full human** depends upon one's **racial
categorisation**]{.underline}. This idea has its roots in the work of
Fanon (1986) who wrote that [black identity was shaped by the white
gaze]{.underline}, but also contemporary writers also consider the
notion of [whiteness as 'death', a categorisation that is rooted in past
oppression and extermination, whose remnants exist to this
day]{.underline}. This perspective on race and existence leads us to
consider what is meant by life, and whether we are not currently living
to our full potential (as Marxists would also propose) when existential
threat is actually amongst us. For Marxists this would be the expansion
of the 'social universe' of capitalism that flows between and through
us, 'capitalising humanity'. [For critical whiteness studies, this
existential threat would be one of whiteness and the negation of
existence for a racially classified group of people.]{.underline}

In order to make this idea of constant existential threat more tangible
(although the term is not used) critical race theorists use what are
known as 'counter-stories' to consider how racial dynamics might develop
in the future, or to highlight inequalities in the present (Delgado
1996). Derrick Bell (1992) who is considered to be the founder of CRT,
uses a much cited counter-story 'The Space Traders' to consider the ways
in which black people's lives are classed as being not equal to those of
whites in the USA. In 'The Space Traders' a race of aliens offer the USA
a trade: all of America's black citizens in return for unlimited,
environmentally friendly, energy and technology. After some debate, the
American people vote on the proposal and decide to give up all of
America's black citizens to the space traders in return for the
futuristic technical goods. Of course, Bell is proposing an analogy
between slavery in the past and the present situation of black people in
the USA, and perhaps even suggesting that such a thing might happen
again. On another level, though, there is also the idea that [the
existence of black people in America is categorised at a **different
level of metaphysical worth** to that of white people. **That life could
be traded so cheaply**]{.underline}, even plausibly (in the thought
experiment) [makes us **pause** for thought in terms of how we
**classify existential threat.**]{.underline}

Although the relationship between CRT and black existentialism may not
always seem obvious we can see that there is a nihilistic streak in the
work of Bell (1992) with regard to the prospects for survival. In
addition, the drawing on the work of Fanon by authors who use CRT as
part of their work which shows the perpetual violence encountered by
people of colour in education as well as the enduring influence of Du
Bois on CRT (Delgado and Stefancic 2001) shows the close connection
between the two theories. [What links CRT and black existentialism is a
basic concern with existence and the meaning of human life under
constant threat that can be thought to underpin any concern with social
justice. From CRT and black existentialism, we therefore see that
**existential threat** is one of **negation** through **economic**,
**social** and **political** systems and there are **degrees of
graduation** between **these forms of existential threats** and
**actual** genocide or **extermination**]{.underline}. The links between
these points and CBET might be considered as obtuse but, as we shall see
in the next chapter, systems of education can play a role in forms of
negation. Obviously, there are social justice implications in the way in
which people are treated in terms of race and ethnicity in education.
The 'triaging' by race and ethnicity of access to education courses, the
ways in which certain groups are rationed access to educational routes
and the fragility of links between education and the labour market for
BAME groups are all part of marginalisation, in which vocational
education plays a large part. As part of this process, and probably not
coincidentally, these groups are also more likely to find themselves in
vocational, CBET courses. However, social justice is not the whole
story, and there is a more profound form of equality associated with the
right to existence. It is this that CBET threatens through the reduction
of the subject to a digital organism as I will show in the next chapter.

## White allies good 

#### It is essential for white scholars to interrupt "politics of forgetting" and recognizing white privilege in IR scholarship

Considering the ideas discussed in this section, **[I believe that it is
fundamentally important to interrupt the 'politics of forgetting'
whiteness and white privilege's weight in our knowledge
production.]{.underline}** As Barbara Applebaum (2010: 9) argues,
'**[for white people, it is impossible to gain an understanding of
systemic racism without naming whiteness and understanding how whiteness
works]{.underline}**'. Therefore, **[marking and naming whiteness and
acknowledging it as the dominant part of racial oppressive systems is
fundamentally necessary]{.underline}** (Ribeiro, 2019b; Roediger, 2002).
**[Recognizing our complicity with racial systems of oppression is just
a small, though necessary, first step if white people are to take
responsibility for our power positions within systems of racial
oppression, including our knowledge (re)production
activities]{.underline}** (Applebaum, 2010; Ignatiev, 1997; Ribeiro,
2019b). **[This first step would be severely incomplete, however, if it
is not accompanied by an 'engagement with the critical anti-racist work
of those positioned as racially subordinate in a white supremacist
system' (Howard, 2004: 75). I seek to take these elements seriously in
the discussion that follows.]{.underline}**

## Framework

### AT: Framework is Racist

#### Arguments stand or fall based on whether they are good -- nothing more nothing less -- framework isn't policing 

**Anderson, Professor of Humanities and English at Brown University, 6**

\[Amanda Anderson , Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Humanities and English
at Brown University, Spring 2006, "Reply to My Critic(s)," Criticism,
Vol. 48, No. 2, p. 281-290, AMM\]

Lets first examine the claim that my book is \"unwittingly\" inviting a
resurrection of the \"Enlightenment-equals-totalitarianism position.\"
[How]{.underline}, one wonders, [could]{.underline} a book [promoting
argument and debate, and promoting reason-giving practices as
a]{.underline} kind of [common ground that should prevail over
assertions of cultural authenticity]{.underline}, [somehow come to be
seen as a]{.underline} [dangerous resurgence of bad Enlightenment?
Robbins tells us why: I want \"argument on my own terms\"-that is, I
want to impose reason on people, which is a form of power and
oppression]{.underline}. [But what can this possibly mean? Arguments
stand or fall]{.underline} [based on whether they are successful and
persuasive, even an argument in favor of argument]{.underline}. [It
simply is not the case that an argument in favor of the importance of
reasoned debate to liberal democracy is]{.underline} [tantamount to
oppressive power]{.underline}. To assume so is to assume, in the manner
of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, that reason is itself violent,
inherently, and that it will always mask power and enforce exclusions.
But to assume this is to assume the very view of Enlightenment reason
that Robbins claims we are \"thankfully\" well rid of. (I leave to the
side the idea that any individual can proclaim that a debate is over,
thankfully or not.) But [perhaps Robbins will say, \"I am not imagining
that your argument is directly oppressive, but that]{.underline} [what
you argue for would be, if it were enforced.\" Yet my book doesn\'t
imagine]{.underline} or [suggest it is enforceable; I
simply]{.underline} [argue in favor of, I promote]{.underline}, [an
ethos of argument within a liberal democratic]{.underline} and
[proceduralist framework]{.underline}. As much as Robbins would like to
think so, [neither I nor the books I write can be cast as an arm of the
police]{.underline}. Robbins wants to imagine a far more direct line of
influence from criticism to political reality, however, and this is why
it can be such a bad thing to suggest norms of argument. Watch as the
gloves come off: Faced with the prospect of submitting to her version of
argument roughly, Habermass version-and of being thus authorized to
disagree only about other, smaller things, some may feel that there will
have been an end to argument, or an end to the arguments they find most
interesting. With current events in mind, I would be surprised if there
were no recourse to the metaphor of a regular army facing a guerilla
insurrection, hinting that Anderson wants to force her opponents to
dress in uniform, reside in well-demarcated camps and capitals that can
be bombed, fight by the rules of states (whether the states themselves
abide by these rules or not), and so on-in short, that she wants to get
the battle onto a terrain where her side will be assured of having the
upper hand. Lets leave to the side the fact that this is a disowned
hypothetical criticism. (As in, \"Well, okay, yes, those are my gloves,
but those are somebody elses hands they will have come off of.\")
Because far more interesting, actually, is the sudden elevation of
stakes. [It is a]{.underline} symptom of the [sorry state of
affairs]{.underline} in our profession [that]{.underline} it [plays
out]{.underline} repeatedly [this]{.underline} [tragicomic tendency to
give a grandiose]{.underline} political [meaning to every
object]{.underline} it analyzes or confronts. We have evidence of how
desperate the situation is when we see it in a critic as thoughtful as
Bruce Robbins, where it emerges as the need to [allegorize]{.underline}
a point about [an argument in such a way that it gets cast as the
equivalent of war atrocities.]{.underline} [It is especially ironic in
light of the fact that to the extent that I do give examples of the
importance of liberal democratic proceduralism, I invoke the disregard
of the protocols of international adjudication in the days leading up to
the invasion of Iraq]{.underline}; I also speak about concerns with
voting transparency. [It is]{.underline} [hard]{.underline} for me [to
see how my argument about proceduralism]{.underline} [can be associated
with the policies of the Bush administration]{.underline} [when that
administration]{.underline} has [exhibited a flagrant disregard of
democratic procedure and the rule of law]{.underline}. I happen to think
that [a renewed focus on proceduralism is a timely venture]{.underline},
which is why I spend so much time discussing it in my final chapter.
[But]{.underline} I hasten to add that [I am not]{.underline} interested
in [imagining that proceduralism is the sole political response to the
needs of cultural criticism in our time: my goal]{.underline} in the
book [is to argue for a]{.underline} [liberal democratic culture of
argument]{.underline}, [and to suggest ways in which argument is not
served by trumping appeals to identity and charismatic
authority]{.underline}. I fully admit that my examples are less
political events than academic debates; for those uninterested in the
shape of intellectual arguments, and eager for more direct and sustained
discussion of contemporary politics, the approach will disappoint.
Moreover, there will always be a tendency for a proceduralist to
under-specify substance, and that is partly a principled decision, since
the point is that agreements, compromises, and policies get worked out
through the communicative and political process. My book is mainly
concentrated on evaluating forms of arguments and appeals to ethos, both
those that count as a form of trump card or distortion, and those that
flesh out an understanding of argument as a universalist practice. There
is an intermittent appeal to larger concerns in the political democratic
culture, and that is because I see connections between the ideal of
argument and the ideal of deliberative democracy. But there is clearly,
and indeed necessarily, significant room for further elaboration here.

### Framework Key to Democracy

#### Effective argumentation is better able to create broader inclusion\-\--radical rejection of existing systems as exclusionary is ineffective and reductionist

**Anderson, Professor of Humanities and English at Brown University, 6**

\[Amanda Anderson , Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Humanities and English
at Brown University, Spring 2006, "Reply to My Critic(s)," Criticism,
Vol. 48, No. 2, p. 281-290, AMM\]

In closing, I\'d like to speak briefly to the question of
proceduralism\'s relevance to democratic vitality. One important way of
extending the proceduralist arguments put forth by Habeimas is to work
on how institutions and practices might better promote participation in
democratic life. The [apathy and nonparticipation plaguing democratic
institutions in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is a
serious problem, and can be]{.underline} **[separated
from]{.underline}** the more romantic theoretical investments in a
refusal to accept the terms of what counts as argument, or in
**[assertions of inassimilable difference]{.underline}**. With respect
to [the latter]{.underline}, which [is often glorified precisely as the
moment when politics or democracy is truly occurring]{.underline}, I
would say, [on the contrary]{.underline} **[democracy is not happening
then]{.underline}**-[rather, the]{.underline} limits or **[deficiencies
of an actually existing democracy are making themselves
felt]{.underline}**. [Acknowledging struggle, conflict, and exclusion is
vital to democracy, but]{.underline} [insisting that exclusion is not so
much a persistent challenge for modern liberal democracies but
rather]{.underline} [inherent to the modern liberal-democratic political
form as such]{.underline} [seems]{.underline} to me **[precisely to
remain stalled in a romantic critique of Enlightenment]{.underline}**.
[It]{.underline} all [comes down to a question of]{.underline} [whether
one wants to work with the ideals of democracy or see them as
essentially normative in a negative sense]{.underline}: [this has been
the legacy of a certain critique of Enlightenment, and it is
astonishingly persistent in the left quarters in the
academy]{.underline}. [One hears it clearly when Robbins
makes]{.underline} confident [reference to liberalisms tendency to
ignore \"the founding acts of violence on which a social order is
based]{.underline}.\" One encounters it in the current vogue for the
work of Giorgio Agamben and Carl Schmitt. [Saying that a state of
exception defines modernity or is internal to the law itself
may]{.underline} help to [sharpen your diagnoses of certain historical
conditions,]{.underline} [but **if absolutized**]{.underline} as it is
in these accounts, [it gives you nothing]{.underline} [but a negative
diagnostic and a **compensatory flight** to a realm entirely
other-the]{.underline} kind of [mystical, Utopian impulse that **flees
from these conditions rather than confronts and fights
them**]{.underline} [on terms that derive from the]{.underline}
settled-if constantly evolving-[normative basis of democratic
modernity.]{.underline} [If one is outraged by the flagrant disregard of
democratic procedures in the current U.S. political regime]{.underline},
then [one needs to be able to coherently say why democratic procedures
matter]{.underline}, [what principles underwrite them, and
what]{.underline} historical movements and [institutions have helped us
to secure and support them]{.underline}. [Argument as a critical
practice]{.underline} [and as a]{.underline} **[key component of
democratic institutions and public debate has a vital role to play in
such a task.]{.underline}**

## Link Answers

### No Link -- Faulty Assumptions

#### No Link - The K makes broad, faulty assertions about the nature of security studies

Economics and Political Science, 20** (Ole and Barry, 2020, Security
Dialogue2020, Vol. 51(4) 386--394, \"Racism and responsibility --The

*H&RM=Howell and Richter-Montpetit*

[One assertion is central to H&RM's article, dominating the abstract:
that the concepts of securitization and desecuritization are distributed
in time and space so that securitization is a threatening re-regression
lurking in a backward black Africa, while desecuritization is a
reasoned, liberal, civilized dialogue characteristic of Europe
(]{.underline}and our prescribed future). [We already debunked their
attempt to pose Europe as the poster child for desecuritization. **H&RM
depict Africa as the essence of securitization, but offer no reason why
Africa should be seen as constitutive for the theory**]{.underline}.
**[The foundational misunderstanding in H&RM's article on which their
whole argument hangs is an alleged 'conceptualization of "normal
politics" as reasoned, civilized dialogue']{.underline}** (H&RM, 2020: 3
\[1\]). In Buzan et al. (1998), we write: [Of course, places do exist
where secrecy or violation of rights is the rule and where security
arguments are not needed to legitimize such acts]{.underline}. The
earlier illustrations were for a liberal-democratic society; in [other
societies there will also be 'rules,' as there are in any society, and
when a securitizing actor uses a rhetoric of existential threat and
thereby takes an issue out of what under those conditions is 'normal
politics,' we have a case of securitization]{.underline}. (Buzan et al.,
1998: 24--25, emphasis added)

Thus, quite explicitly, '**[normal politics' is not a politics with some
specific attributes ('liberal', 'civilized', 'reasoned'); it is whatever
passed as normal until an exception was installed through
securitization]{.underline}**. H&RM do not consult the existing
secondary literature on this, but instead repeatedly restate [their own
(false) definition that 'normal politics' means reasoned, liberal,
civilized dialogue]{.underline}. From there, **[they associate freely
into this being 'a teleological hierarchy of civilizational advancement
from securitization towards politicization' (]{.underline}**H&RM, 2020:
8 \[6\]). This characterization they support with a reference to pp. 53
and 69 in the Framework book. **[It looks damning when H&RM write thus
and back it with a reference; but, if you read those pages, there is
absolutely no hint of securitization-to-politicization being cast in
evolutionary or civilizational terms]{.underline}**. [Their article
contains dozens of similar instances, where they make a reference to our
texts but what you find there is not what they claim]{.underline}.

Significantly, **[their definition of 'normal politics' could not work
for securitization theory]{.underline}**, because, as argued very
strongly by Wæver (2011, 2015), t[he theory needs a clean concept of
securitization as a distinct operation that is contrasted simply to the
non-securitized (called 'normal politics'), not a substantial concept of
'normal politics' as holding particular teleological (e.g. liberal
democratic) qualities. **Securitization is an 'operation' that is
available for deployment and contestation in all societies at all
times**]{.underline}. [The unprofessional citation practices of H&RM are
the smaller problem;]{.underline} **[the big one is that they don't
read. They inject elements into the theory that both aren't there and
couldn't be there.]{.underline}** [Methodology matters]{.underline}.

**[H&RM avoid understanding the theory they are
attacking]{.underline}**. [On the second page of their article, they
state that securitization theory has been attractive because 'it
provides a clear set of steps and standards for . . . deciding whether
\[the referent objects\] should indeed be "securitized]{.underline}"'
(H&RM, 2020: 4 \[2\]). **[No. The theory does not aim to guide when
something 'should be securitized'. It is a framework for analysing what
happens when something is securitized and the politics of struggles over
this act]{.underline}**. [It is argued systematically in all the major
works]{.underline} (and has been a common target of criticism) [that
securitization theory cannot and will not prescribe when something
'should be securitized']{.underline}. H&RM make no attempt to present
the securitization theory project, its animating agenda, and the
political or academic setting into which the texts intervened. [If they
had explained what the theory and the key texts were designed to
achieve, they simply could not argue as they do]{.underline}

[H&RM generally use quotations radically out of context.]{.underline}
[They never study what is done in the texts they are 'reading'. They say
nothing about their own methodology or data selection and give no
principles for interpretation]{.underline}. **[They do not define
racism]{.underline}** (see response by Lene Hansen \[2020\]), **[and
they don't discuss at all what it means to read a theory and judge
whether it is racist]{.underline}**. Given that this is the theme of the

theory]{.underline}**. [If there is a methodology at play, it is
deepfake in the sense that if you break a corpus of text down into small

falsehood. The analogy is to the technique: making somebody 'speak' by
using splinters from them reassembled to produce meaning disconnected

citations.]{.underline}** Impressive forerunners do exactly what they
don't: Stoler (1995) and Mills (1997) trace meticulously how their
analysed theorists struggle to do specific things, and then what role
race plays in enabling this. **[H&RM, in contrast, ignore what

### No Link -- Security Intersectional

#### Generic link homogenizes international relations, prefer situated and empirical evidence

securitization theory be saved from itself? A decolonial and feminist
intervention", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S) 78-87, EBSCO, GDI

The concept of **[intersectionality is essential for
understanding]{.underline}** the main structures of modem society -
patriarchy, racism, and capitalism - that demarcate people's lives and
political processes, and, consequently, the dynamics of **[international
security]{.underline}**. These social structures that interact with each
other create the categories of women, race, and class (Davis, 1981) that
segregate and hier- archize social groups. In dialogue with
intersectional theory, decolonial feminism (Lugones, 2010) places these
three dimensions in an international perspective, emphasizing the idea
of coloniality. **[Thus, patriarchy, racism, and capitalism are the main
social structures strongly demarcated by historical colonialism and its
roots in the economy, politics and culture that persist to the present
day]{.underline}**, establishing what Lugones defines as the
'colonial/modem gender system'.

**[Although these concepts can lead to different paths of analysis,
their epistemological common ground allows us to advocate that
coloniality, racialization, and genderization are products of his-
torical constmctions, neither universal nor essential.]{.underline}**
**[Culturally and historically situated analysis of securitization
processes has the capacity to incorporate social classification
configurations such as racialization and genderization]{.underline}**,
although we do not see this happening very often. We intend to
illustrate in the next section how the conduct of **[empirical research
plays a decisive role in efforts to analyze the social configurations of
power in securitization processes.]{.underline}**

## Impacts

### Case Outweighs -- Extinction

#### Existential threats outweigh -- correct cognitive biases against them 

**Farquhar et al 17** (Sebastian, former head of the global priorities
project, "Existential Risk: Diplomacy and Governance." Global Priorities
Project, 2017,
<https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf>,
Accessed 7/17/20, GDI -- JMoore)

1.2. THE ETHICS OF EXISTENTIAL RISK

In his book Reasons and Persons, Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit
advanced an influential argument about the importance of avoiding
extinction:

I believe that if we destroy mankind, as we now can, this outcome will
be much worse than most people think. [Compare]{.underline} three
outcomes:

[(1) Peace.]{.underline}

[(2) A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world's ex- isting
population.]{.underline}

[(3) A nuclear war that kills 100%.]{.underline}

\(2\) would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is
the greater of these two differences? Most people believe that the
greater difference is between (1) and (2). I believe that [the
difference between (2) and (3) is very much greater]{.underline}. \...
[The Earth will remain habitable for at least another billion
years.]{.underline} Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If
we do not destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny
fraction of the whole of civilized human history. The difference between
(2) and (3) may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and
all of the rest of this history. If we compare this possible his- tory
to a day, what has occurred so far is only a fraction of a second.65

In this argument, it seems that Parfit is assuming that the [survivors
of a]{.underline} nuclear [war that kills 99% of the population would
eventually be able to recover civilisation without long-term
effect.]{.underline} As we have seen, this may not be a safe assumption
-- but for the purposes of this thought experiment, the point stands.
[What makes existential catastrophes especially bad is that they would
"destroy the future,"]{.underline} as another Oxford philosopher, Nick
Bostrom, puts it.66 [This future could potentially be extremely long and
full of flourishing, and would therefore have extremely large
value.]{.underline} In standard risk analysis, when working out how to
respond to risk, we work out the expected value of risk reduction, by
weighing the probability that an action will prevent an adverse event
against the severity of the event. [Because the value of pre- venting
existential catastrophe is so vast, even a tiny probability of
prevention has huge expected value.]{.underline}67

Of course, there is persisting reasonable disagreement about ethics and
there are a number of ways one might resist this conclusion.68
Therefore, it would be unjustified to be overconfident in Parfit and
Bostrom's argument.

In some areas, government policy does give significant weight to future
generations. For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear waste
storage, [governments have considered timeframes of
thousands]{.underline}, hundreds of thousands, [and even a million
years.]{.underline}69 [Justifications]{.underline} for this policy
usually [appeal]{.underline} [to]{.underline} principles of
[intergenerational equity]{.underline} according to which [future
generations ought]{.underline} [to get as much protection as current
generations.]{.underline}70 Similarly, widely accepted norms of
sustainable development require development that meets the needs of the
current generation without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs.71

However, when it comes to existential risk, it would seem that we fail
to live up to principles of intergenerational equity. [Existential
catastrophe would not only give future generations less than the current
generations; it would give them nothing.]{.underline} Indeed, [reducing
existential risk plausibly]{.underline} [has a quite low cost for us in
comparison with the huge expected value it has for future
generations.]{.underline} In spite of this, relatively little is done to
reduce existential risk. Unless we give up on norms of intergenerational
equity, they give us a strong case for significantly increasing our
efforts to reduce existential risks.

1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERINVESTED IN, AND
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

[In spite of]{.underline} the [importance of existential
risk]{.underline} re- duction, it probably [receives less attention than
is warranted.]{.underline} As a result, concerted international co-
operation is required if we are to receive adequate protection from
existential risks.

1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be underinvested in

There are several reasons why existential risk re- duction is likely to
be underinvested in. Firstly, it is a global public good. Economic
theory predicts that such goods tend to be underprovided. The benefits
of existential risk reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed
around the globe from the countries responsible for taking action.
Consequently, a country which reduces existential risk gains only a
small portion of the benefits but bears the full brunt of the costs.
Countries thus have strong incentives to free ride, receiving the
benefits of risk reduction without contributing. As a result, too few do
what is in the common interest.

Secondly, as already suggested above, [existential risk reduction is an
intergenerational public good: most of the benefits are enjoyed by
future generations]{.underline} who have no say in the political
process. For these goods, [the problem is temporal free riding: the
current generation enjoys the benefits of inaction while future
generations bear]{.underline} [the costs.]{.underline}

Thirdly, many existential risks, such as machine superintelligence,
engineered pandemics, and solar geoengineering, pose an unprecedented
and uncertain future threat. Consequently, it is hard to develop a
satisfactory governance regime for them: there are few existing
governance instruments which can be applied to these risks, and it is
unclear what shape new instruments should take. In this way, our
position with regard to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we
faced when nuclear weapons first became available.

[Cognitive biases]{.underline} also [lead people to underestimate
existential risks.]{.underline} [Since there have not been any
catastrophes of this magnitude, these risks are not salient to
politicians and the public.]{.underline}72 This is an example of the
misapplication of the availability heuristic, a mental shortcut which
assumes that something is important only if it can be readily recalled.

[Another cognitive bias affecting perceptions of existential risk is
scope neglect.]{.underline} In a seminal 1992 study, three groups were
asked how much they would be willing to pay to save 2,000, 20,000 or
200,000 birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups answered
\$80, \$78, and \$88, respectively.73 In this case, the size of the
benefits had little effect on the scale of the preferred response.
People be- come numbed to the effect of saving lives when the numbers
get too large. 74 Scope neglect is a particularly acute problem for
existential risk because the numbers at stake are so large. Due to scope
neglect, [decision-makers are prone to treat existential risks in a
similar way to problems which are less severe by many orders of
magnitude. A wide range of other cognitive biases are likely to affect
the evaluation of existential risks.]{.underline}75

### Case Outweighs -- Russia Adv

#### The K sanitizes russian authoritarianism

**Dearment, senior reporter at MedCity News covering biotech

Western 'Anti-War' Left For Fools - Above the Law\",

[The basic premise of these ideas is that the US and NATO should do
nothing substantial to deter Russia from invading and then sit on their
hands if it actually does invade]{.underline}. **[The bigger question is
why so many leftists who claim to be anti-war and anti-imperialist would
give succor to Russia as it engages in the very warmongering and
imperialism they claim to deplore.]{.underline}**

[One possible reason is a longstanding binary worldview that sees the US
as the main cause of the world's problems and so irredeemably evil that
it praises any nation opposing its interests]{.underline} -- e.g., the
Soviet Union during the Cold War, Russia in the present, China,
Venezuela or Syria. **[This inevitably leads to double standards when it
comes to imperialism and human rights abuses and a tendency to blame the
US and its allies first.]{.underline}**

The Iraq war didn't help either, giving rise to isolationism and
kneejerk cynicism about American foreign policy whereby anything
emanating from the Pentagon or State Department is assumed to be a lie.
[But unlike Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,]{.underline} **[Russia's
forces amassed along Ukraine's border are clearly
visible.]{.underline}**

Another is Russian propaganda, disseminated by state-owned outlets like
RT and Sputnik. [They have been tremendously successful at pumping
pro-Russian ideas into Western political discourse while also promoting
anti-system populist politics aimed at exacerbating divisions and
destabilizing democracies.]{.underline} Kremlin propagandists can count
every Westerner sincerely arguing Russia has "legitimate concerns" about
"NATO expansion" as a success story.

But **[a larger reason is a failure to admit what Russia actually is and
always has been, which is a colonial empire, every bit as much as its
Spanish, British and French counterparts]{.underline}**. [The
differences are that it was an empire of land rather than sea, and that
with the collapse of the monarchy in 1917 it slapped a left-wing
revolutionary coat of paint onto a state that remained just as
imperialist as when the tsars ruled from Petrograd.]{.underline}

That's why Georgia's first tenure as a democratic republic after
declaring independence in 1918 lasted only three years, ending with the
Red Army invading and taking over the country in 1921. Armenia and
independence movements in Central Asia experienced similar fates.

Consequently, [the decolonization that Spain, the UK and other European
powers underwent after World War II didn't come to Russia until 1991,
when the Soviet Union collapsed. That decolonization is what Putin
referred to as "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century" in
2005]{.underline}.

But [where other former European colonial powers are content to let
their former colonies govern their own affairs, Putin cannot tolerate
former Russian colonies doing the same.]{.underline} **[That's why
pro-democratic uprisings in post-Soviet countries -- most recently
Belarus and Kazakhstan -- scare him so much and is likely the reason he
has his eyes on Ukraine.]{.underline}** After all, a Ukraine that is
free, democratic and prosperous and enjoys close ties with the West
threatens his ill-gotten power and wealth, [as it might cause Russians
to start asking why they can't have democracy and prosperity
too.]{.underline}

[**If a war breaks out in Europe, it will happen because a predatory,
kleptocratic mafia state presided over by a psychopathic dictator
started it**. It will be because all the diplomacy in the world could
not stop Putin's revanchist desire to restore Soviet power]{.underline}.
**[Undermining efforts to prevent that from happening or punish Putin's
regime if he does invade isn't anti-war]{.underline}**.

### Case Outweighs - War turns Racism 

#### War outweighs and turns every impact 

**Horgan 14** (John, "War Is Our Most Urgent Problem\--Let's Solve It."

Accessed 7/17/20, GDI -- JMoore)

[Is there a more urgent problem]{.underline} in the world today [than
war?]{.underline} And when I say \"war\" in this post, I mean also
militarism, the culture of war, the armies, arms, industries, policies,
plans, propaganda, prejudices, rationalizations that make lethal group
conflict not only possible but also likely.

My answer to the above question: [No]{.underline}, there is no more
urgent problem than war. [Not climate change, pollution, overpopulation,
oppression, poverty, inequality, hunger, disease.]{.underline}

[If you seek solutions to any of these problems, you should]{.underline}
also [devote]{.underline} at least some [effort to ending
war]{.underline}, for several reasons. First, [war exacerbates or
perpetuates our other problems, either directly or by
draining]{.underline} precious [resources away from their
solution.]{.underline} [War]{.underline} subverts democracy and promotes
tyranny and fanaticism; [kills and sickens and impoverishes people;
ravages nature. War is a keystone problem]{.underline}, the eradication
of which would make our other social problems much more tractable.

Second, [war]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [more readily
solvable]{.underline} than many other human afflictions. [War is
not]{.underline} like a hurricane, earthquake or Ebola plague, a natural
disaster foisted on us by forces [beyond our control.]{.underline} [War
is entirely our creation]{.underline}, the product of human choices. War
could end tomorrow if a relatively small group of people around the
world chose to end it.

Third, more than any of our other problems, [war represents a horrific
moral crime.]{.underline} Particularly when carried out by the U.S. and
other nations, or by groups that aspire to or claim the legitimacy of
states, [war makes hypocrites of us and makes a mockery of human
progress. We cannot claim to be civilized as long as war or even the
threat of war persists.]{.underline}

Yes, [annual war casualties have declined]{.underline} sharply since the
cataclysmic first half of the 20th century. Over the last few decades,
war has killed far fewer people than cancer or automobile accidents.
[But in our heavily---and nuclear---armed world, war is a few decisions
away from becoming exponentially more destructive.]{.underline} And even
the killing of a single child by a U.S. drone, Israeli rocket or Syrian
tank is an abomination that corrupts us all.

## Permutation

### Perm -- Do Both: Eclecticism

#### Perm -- Do Both -- Security is contingent not a fixed construct, approaching perm as eclecticism best way to evaluate and synthesize disparate paradigms. 

**Makinda, Murdoch University, International Relations and Security
Studies Professor, 21** (Samuel M., Perth, Australia, "Critical security
studies, racism and eclecticism", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S)
142-151, EBSCO)

I argue here that **[one of the appropriate reparative possibilities for
critical security studies lies in eclecticism]{.underline}**. Those who
have employed eclecticism in the past have described it as **[a process
through which scholars trespass paradigmatic boundaries and combine
insights from different par- adigms to analyse a given
problem]{.underline}** (Makinda, 2000a; Sil and Katzenstein, 2010). For
example, Katzenstein and Sil have argued that 'eclecticism **[is
distinguished by the fact that features of analy- ses in theories
initially embedded in separate research traditions can be separated from
their respective foundations, translated meaningfully, and recombined as
part of an original permuta- tion of concepts, methods, analytics, and
empirics']{.underline}** (Katzenstein and Sil, 2008: 110-111, emphasis
in original). Earlier, I had defined eclecticism 'as a process through
**[which a theorist constructs a coherent analytical approach by
utilizing, synthesizing and reflecting on insights from disparate
paradigms']{.underline}** (Makinda, 2000b: 398). I posited that
eclecticists would need to meet some conditions. 'First, they would need
**[to recognize, but at the same time refuse to be confined by,
paradigmatic horizons']{.underline}** (Makinda, 2000b: 400). Explaining
that eclecticism had the potential to emancipate scholars from
paradigmatic constraints, I argued **[that the refusal by eclecticists
'to be bound by paradigmatic boundaries requires acknowledgement that
these socio-mental constrictions are not fixed, but
contingent']{.underline}** (Makinda, 2000b: 400). I added that
**[eclecticism could be used to 'explore the possibilities of pursuing
an \[international relations\] discipline that takes account of the
percep- tions of us/them, self/other and inside/outside in non-European
traditions']{.underline}** (Makinda, 2000b: 399).

### Perm -- Do Both: Eclecticism -- 1AR

#### Claims to alt exclusivity turns the K

**Makinda, Murdoch University, International Relations and Security
Studies Professor, 21** (Samuel M., Perth, Australia, "Critical security
studies, racism and eclecticism", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S)
142-151, EBSCO)

While critical security studies emerged from a cross-fertilization of
ideas, cultures and traditions representing different parts of the
world, it has increasingly been made to identify itself with European
values, traditions and thoughts that go back to the critiques of
modernity and the Enlightenment. This identification with one source of
ideas has meant that critical security studies continues to exclude from
the conversation a large part of the world that gave birth to it. The
con- clusion is that [critical security studies has not only missed the
benefits that come with the cross- fertilization of ideas, but also
alienated itself from its own foundations.]{.underline} Moreover, [by
aspiring to become a paradigm that competes with other security studies
para- digms for hegemony, critical security studies has unwittingly
compromised some of its principles and ethical commitments]{.underline}.
The strength of critical security studies comes from its ability to
expose the forces of oppression and domination, but it cannot do so
effectively when it is promoting the hegemony of ideas associated with
Gramsci and the Frankfurt School. [It]{.underline} also [cannot
consistently seek to eliminate exclusion and advocate inclusion when it
is establishing its own strict boundary lines.]{.underline}

#### Perm solves - 

**Makinda, Murdoch University, International Relations and Security
Studies Professor, 21** (Samuel M., Perth, Australia, "Critical security
studies, racism and eclecticism", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S)
142-151, EBSCO)

I recommend [eclecticism as a reparative possibility]{.underline} for
critical security studies through which the competing research
programmes would be on a par. One of its benefits is that it [can
provide a platform for negotiating over, and mediating, the competing
normative and political agendas that underpin paradigms]{.underline}. As
Neufeld (1993) has argued, [reflexivity acknowledges that differences
between international relations paradigms are inherently
normative]{.underline} and that 'reasoned assessment' can adjudicate
between competing normative claims. With such an approach, it would be
our hon- esty, our [willingness to engage in dialogue with those
who]{.underline} may [disagree]{.underline} with us [and]{.underline}
our readiness to [acknowledge]{.underline} our [debts to fellow
scholars]{.underline} that [will pave the way for a robust, inclusive
and ethi- cal critical security studies.]{.underline}

### Perm -- Do Both (Abolition)

#### Perm -- Do Both -- Embrace vulnerability and fugitivity challenges colonial impulse to mastery, collapsing activism and academia

**Manchanda, Queen Mary University London International Politics Senior
Lecturer, 21** (Dr Nivi, "The banalization of race in international
security studies: From absolution to abolition", Security Dialogue 2021,
Vol. 52(S) 49-59, EBSCO, GDI access 7/12/22)

In the third and final instance, and somewhat counter-intuitively,
[international security studies can turn to alternate modes of knowing
that reject the foreclosure inherent in colonial and raced
understandings of]{.underline} concepts such as 'liberty' and
'[security']{.underline}. Bamor Hesse (2014: 288) ventures that the
cherished notion of 'liberty' emerges through a 'hegemony of Western
formulation' that denies its 'indebtedness to Western colonialism'. This
holds equally true for 'security' and for synthetic accounts of
'ontological insecurity', 'securitization theory' and 'deterrence' at
the crux of the (sub) discipline. [One way out of this impasse is for
international security studies to be open to]{.underline} what Julietta
Singh (2017: 21) has called [a 'vulnerable reading']{.underline}. A
vulnerable reading of international security studies' own history and
the challenges it faces both in its theory and in practice [would go
against its colonial impulse towards 'mastery']{.underline} (J. Singh,
2017) [and instead expand the conditions of possibility for the
field]{.underline}. Pushing further, embracing '[vulnerability' as a
strategy would mount a wholesale challenge to the conventional
objectives]{.underline} of international security studies and its auxil-
iary concept 'resilience'. [Vulnerability necessarily engenders
exposure, as opposed to foreclosur]{.underline}e. In the context of a
pandemic, it might entail pushing back against medical police (McQuade
and Neocleous, 2020) and resisting greater border violence, even as they
appear warranted. [This 'open- ing up']{.underline} of international
security studies both politically and strategically [is not a panacea,
but can function as an important remedial step. Coupled with an
engagement with the Black radical tradi- tion's notion of 'fugitivity'-
a form of 'political escape from the Western hegemony']{.underline}
(Hesse, 2014: 302) [and the colonial architecture of knowledge -
vulnerability proffers a question if not an answer: what does it mean to
escape from immurement by]{.underline} conventional (read: [raced)
notions of security?]{.underline}

Nonetheless, if de-raced notions of security offer only a contradiction,
then to begin to answer the question one must once again turn to
abolition. [Abolition looks at connections]{.underline} - between polic-
ing and border violence, between the incarceration of indigenous
populations, detainees and people of colour and their continued
dispossession, expropriation and extraction. Robin Kelley (2020)
succinctly captures its tenor thus: 'Abolition works to dismantle
systems that have caused harm, namely police and prisons, and reallocate
funds to social and economic resources, and to develop new systems of
community-controlled public safety and restorative justice'. This
purposeful diversion of funds, resources and other energies away from
the structural violence of state-sponsored militarism, to alternate
political projects, requires astute research and scholarly analysis. [By
continuing to uphold the tactical separation of 'activism' and
'academia' and subli- mating 'race' as an exclusive concern of the
former domain, in keeping with its political theory and international
relations antecedents, international security studies ensures racial
events remain for- ever 'banalized']{.underline}. [Challenging this
assumed incommensurability and putting activism, policy and scholarship
back in their relational context would allow international security
studies to also dis- card some of its ahistoricity, specifically with
regard to its colonial roots.]{.underline}

[These strategies]{.underline} are not light-touch; they [cannot be
simply appropriated and tacked on]{.underline} in an attempt to shed the
anachronism of international security studies, but require a
fundamental - and relational - volte face that many would no doubt argue
is impossible for a discipline so steeped in, and governed by, the
logics of coloniality. Indeed, as we have seen, 'security' is a key node
in the racialized theoretical apparatus of not only international
relations but also political theory. [Nevertheless, a sustained effort
to undo and unlearn - to denaturalize - the categories of both the
'lecture hall' and the 'professional journal', to perform what Harney
and Moten]{.underline} (2013: 36) [call 'the enactment of a security
breach' ad nauseam, can fashion a break from international security
stud- ies' racial filiation]{.underline}. [A 'decolonial' discipline may
not be achievable, but an anti-racist one is not just possible but also
essential.]{.underline} The politics of recognition and repentance is
not enough. To paraphrase Ruth Wilson Gilmore (forthcoming): in order to
change security studies, we have to change everything.

accessed GDI-TM)

[A related critique posed against abolition, is that carceral abolition
also actively opposes certain kinds of solutions and
desires]{.underline}. [Abolition critiques the carceral system and
carceral logics, but also critiques efforts to reform carceral sites,
because some of the factors lead- ing to the growth of the carceral
State were the direct result of attempts to reform the sys-
tem]{.underline}. This is also directly linked to the lineage of
abolition of slavery. As Kim Gilmore (2000) explains, "The connections
between slavery and imprisonment have been used by abolitionists as a
historical explanation and as part of a radical political strategy that
ques- tions the feasibility of "reform" as an appropriate response to
prison expansion."

[In practice, reform and abolition are on a continuum.]{.underline} For
example, in Politics of Abo- lition, Mathiesen (1974) follows Andre
Gorz's [distinction between reformist and 'non- reformist' reforms.
Reformist reforms are situated in the status quo, so that any changes
are made within or against this existing framework. Non reformist
reforms imagine a different horizon and are not limited by a discussion
of what is possible at present]{.underline}. Mathiesen states

[that non-reformist reforms that are effective need to be of the
abolishing kind.]{.underline} [The question is what kinds of reforms are
sought and whether they will strengthen the system in the long
run]{.underline} (Ben-Moshe 2013; Kaba 2014). For instance, [fighting
for adequate health care for pris- oners is something abolitionists
often support, as a non-reformist reform]{.underline}. However, some
initiatives such as mental health jails are opposed by abolitionists, as
these would only expand the scope of incarceration in the long haul.

[But, critics say, if everything offered can be conceived as being
reformist, what solu- tions does the abolitionist offer? I suggest that
this question is rooted in the kind of episte- mological assumptions
that are better abandoned by abolitionists. This demand only makes sense
if it is engrained in privileged positionality and not in intersectional
subjugated knowledge, or maroonage, as those already oppressed do not
feel secure in the first place]{.underline}. In short, as Ahmed (2010a)
explains, this is the work of the feminist killjoy: "Feminists, by
declaring themselves feminists, are already read as destroying something
that is thought of by others not only as being good but as the cause of
happiness" (2010a: 581). Feminists (and other affect aliens, as Ahmed
refers to them, including abolitionists) "hence brings others down, not
only by talking about unhappy topics such as sexism but by exposing how
happiness is sustained, by erasing the signs of not getting along"
(2010a: 582). If we take this one step further to intersectional
struggles "The angry black woman can be described as a killjoy; she may
even kill feminist joy, for example, by pointing out forms of racism
within feminist politics" (2010a: 583).

[The call of "don't talk about it unless you have a solution" assumes
there is a monolithic answer to the question of 'what is to be
done']{.underline}. [As Davis (2003) contends, as abolitionists,
thinking about substitutions to prisons or incarceration is
inapt]{.underline}. [Instead we should concep- tualize a world without
the footprint of the prison]{.underline}. [That is exactly the problem
with car- ceral locales]{.underline}---such as detention centers, psych
hospitals, prisons---[they become catch all solutions to diverse social
issues.]{.underline} [One of the difficulties of conceptualizing a world
without prisons is that many think about a monolithic system that will
replace the punitive one we have now. Instead, we will need to deal with
to handle certain harms and their effects in a myriad of
ways.]{.underline}

[Abolitionists work on a case by case basis in their campaigns, research
and calls for action]{.underline}. They are often in a position of not
knowing what to do. [This seeming chasm between pragmatism and vision
for the future of a non-carceral society are not necessar- ily binary
opposites]{.underline}, [especially if we think about it through the
duality of the both/and approach suggested by Harbin (2016) in relation
to the epistemology of disorientation as being generative.]{.underline}

### Alternative Fails -- Rejection Bad

#### Essentializing critiques of security studies restricts productive engagements with the field

Following Bhambra, [Howell and Richter-Montpetit's diagnosis is driven
by a suspicion that central approaches in critical security studies may
inadvertently reproduce racialized forms of exclusion and
violence]{.underline}. Suspicion has a rich history in critical
theorizing. Paul Ricœur (1970) famously coined the notion of
'hermeneutics of suspicion' to denote an analytical ethos that he
associated with Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In his
view, [these authors shared a commitment towards exposing the truth
hidden beneath the surface appearance of reality. Things, in other
words, are not what they seem.]{.underline} The hermeneutics of
suspicion continues to play a significant role today -- for example, in
the idea of speaking truth to power -- and informs various international
relations approaches, including some forms of realist theory. [In
critical security studies, however, the hermeneutics of suspicion has
given way to a different form of suspicion, **one that does not seek to
uncover the real intentions or interests behind or beneath discourse but
instead explores the systematic reproduction of violence and exclusions
through discourse and practice**]{.underline}. It is a form of critique
that is suspicious about the context, [uptake and circulation of
concepts and theories, and what is lost, marginalized or silenced in the
(re)production of that knowledge.]{.underline} [**Howell and
Richter-Montpetit are explicit that their analysis is of the latter
kind. Their claim is not that critical security studies scholars
secretly pursue a racist agenda under the veneer of science, but that
central concepts in critical security studies**, such as biopolitics or
securitization**, perform racial work and, in doing so, contribute to
the reproduction of racial hierarchies**]{.underline} [and white
supremacy]{.underline}

Bearing in mind that international relations theory, including critical
international relations theory, has contributed to the reproduction and
hence naturalization of whiteness in world politics, a healthy dose of
suspicion about epistemic racism and methodological whiteness is clearly
warranted (see, for example, Hobson, 2007; Sabaratnam, 2020; Vitalis,
2015). Yet [there are also some in-built limits to the critical ethos of
suspicion]{.underline}. In Ricœur's original formulation, **[the limit
is that of a structural paranoia grounded in a profound mistrust of
reality]{.underline}**. **[Paranoia]{.underline}** [can be a productive
force**, but is also unidirectional, anticipatory and
elitist**]{.underline} ([the claim to have privileged access to a truth
hidden from others)]{.underline} (for a discussion, see Sedgwick, 1997).
**[The kind of suspicion Howell and RichterMontpetit subscribe to seeks
to transcend the limits of paranoia. It abandons the idea of a layered
reality and sidesteps the issue of intentions and
interests]{.underline}** (Howell and Richter-Montpetit, 2020: 4). Still,
similar problems remain. In particular, [the fallacy of essentialism
looms large. In Howell and Richter-Montpetit's analysis, such
essentialism manifests itself in their conviction that the epistemic
racism]{.underline} they identify in the Copenhagen School is
[inescapable and automatically reproduced with every attempt at
rearticulation. For them, any recuperation of securitization theory is
doomed to repeat the original sin of racism -- just as securitization
theory itself cannot but repeat the racism present in the work of
authors on which it draws]{.underline} (Howell and Richter-Montpetit,
2020: 7--9). It is worth citing their conclusion in length:

Once classic securitization theory is stripped of its racist conceptual
and methodological apparatus . . . there is very little left. Perhaps
what remains is simply the word 'securitization'. But even this word is
potentially problematic, because inherent in it is a temporal move from
normal politics towards the (exceptional) violence of security. Authors
attempting to recuperate the term 'securitization' must take care not to
indulge in white nostalgia for a better, more innocent time: a time that
does not exist for those who have been subject to colonialism or the
racial contract on scales from the local to the global -- that is to
say, the majority of the world's people. Such a recuperative
intellectual project, if at all possible, has yet to be articulated.
(Howell and Richter-Montpetit, 2020: 17)

[Suspicion can serve the critical objective of historicizing and
contextualizing seemingly abstract or neutral concepts such as
securitization or biopolitics**, but here it transforms into an
essentialist argument that instead fixes the meaning and character of
words, concepts and theories across time and space.**]{.underline}
Characterized by a unidirectional anticipation of the future, [such a
view entails that structural forms of injustice, such as epistemic
racism, can be simply presumed to follow every time the 'S-word' is
uttered.]{.underline} As an intellectual strategy, **[such a finalistic
version of suspicion does not serve the field of critical security
studies well.]{.underline}** Indeed, [Howell and Richter-Montpetit fail
to acknowledge that almost **every empirical 'application' of
securitization theory has involved a serious rearticulation of its core
concepts and their relations**]{.underline}. These rearticulations
could, of course, reproduce problematic assumptions about race that
taint the empirical analysis or foreclose important avenues of inquiry,
but this is not a matter that can be adjudicated in advance. [Nor is it
true that such recuperative projects do not exist]{.underline}. For
example, [**Claudia Aradau's (2004) radical rearticulation of
desecuritization seems to avoid the pitfalls Howell and
Richter-Montpetit associate with the Copenhagen School.** Her
work]{.underline}, as well as that of others, [shows that thinking with
a theory often also involves thinking against that theory and
illustrates how new or more progressive interpretations often cannot
exist without prior ones.]{.underline}

In addition, **[the risk of confirmation bias -- the tendency for an
analyst to read selectively and overlook or exclude examples that do not
fit her or his assumptions -- looms large]{.underline}** [in such
essentialist forms of suspicion]{.underline}. [Despite significant
differences in tone, both Lene Hansen's (2020) rejoinder and the
response by Ole Wæver and Barry Buzan (2020) point out]{.underline}
**[that Howell and RichterMontpetit's analysis of securitization theory
suffers from this methodological fallacy.]{.underline}** Howell and
Richter-Montpetit's critique of Foucauldian security studies admittedly
leaves more room for recuperative readings,4 but at times runs up
against similar problems. [For example, it is not evident on the basis
of what criteria the field of Foucauldian security studies is
delineated, and at times it appears set up in such a way as to
corroborate pre-existing suspicions]{.underline}.5 To be sure, [theories
and concepts may at times come with heavy historical baggage that
overdetermines their meaning. Still, even then, the criticality of a
rearticulation depends not just on the theories and thinkers invoked,
but also on what such an engagement forecloses or opens up]{.underline}.
**[Suspicion]{.underline}** is an indispensable part of critical
theorizing **[but can also unduly restrict productive engagements with
prior work, including critical security studies' own intellectual
ancestry]{.underline}**.

### Alternative Fails -- No Real World Solvency

#### No Alternative spillover -- won't change real world policymaking

Needless to say, [the theoretical and philosophical discussions for this
less state-centric definition of security are anchored in the English
school and liberal internationalists. But more often than not their
contribution is obscured by the disagreements within the aca- demic
discipline of international relations theory, if they are not pitted
against the dominant realists and neo-realists to compete for an
authoritative voice. A discernable challenge is how much impact the
academic, theoretical debates have on policymakers, particularly those
in the foreign and security policy community of great
powers]{.underline}. This is not to say that the theoretical world that
offers a more nuanced approach to international relations has had no
bearing on the real policy world and conducts of great powers. Nor do
the realists, particularly prevalent in the US, only see the world in
the classical balance of military power terms, if only because of the
"discovery" of the utility of power of persuasion, or soft power, as an
effective tool of American diplomacy in winning friends in the Cold War.
But [in mainstream policy discussions about geopolitical competition
between the US and China, there appears little room for
nuance.]{.underline}

### Alternative Fails - Flawed Methodologies

*H&RM=Howell and Richter-Montpetit*

Replying, we face a difficult dilemma**[. The methodology and academic
standards of the H&RM piece are so profoundly and systematically flawed
as to void the authors' argument]{.underline}**, [and we think the lack
of credible supporting evidence makes their charge
libellous]{.underline}. To properly demonstrate the depth and extent of
H&RM's errors and misrepresentations requires a full, point-by-point
critique. Yet, during a lengthy correspondence with Security Dialogue,
the editors insisted that if we submitted our critique as a reply it
should comply with the standard length of 4,000 words2 and refused
simultaneous publication with H&RM's article. They claimed to see no
difference between a charge of racism and normal academic disputes about
facts, methods or theories, and therefore no case for amending their
normal practice. They furthermore insisted on reviewing our reply: the
editors want to be judge and jury as well as defendants[**.**
Consequently, we are reluctant to publish this reply in Security
Dialogue at all. Within a 4,000-word limit, we can hardly begin to lay
out the full details of H&RM's poor scholarship, let alone explore the
more general, and very serious, questions this affair raises for the
discipline of international relations and the fight against
racism.]{.underline} There is a case for denying the authors and
Security Dialogue the oxygen of discussion that they seem to hope for in
publishing such toxic and outlandish charges. We decided to offer a
short reply in Security Dialogue only to state our principled views and
to open a portal from the epicentre of the affair to a detailed reply.

What follows addresses only highlights of the catalogue of
methodological and conceptual errors in H&RM's article. **[The full
reply, which interested readers hopefully will consult, leaves almost
nothing of H&RM's argument standing.]{.underline}** [This dispiriting
affair raises important questions for the discipline of international
relations that we can only hint at here but address in our longer
reply]{.underline}: • How can and should international relations take on
structural/systemic racism? • What are criteria for evidence by which
one can identify the inner logic of a theory in order to critique its
foundations? • How well or badly do H&RM reflect the background
literatures they draw upon? • What can securitization theory actually do
and not do when applied to the scourge of racism? • Is racism such a
uniquely damaging force that the academic struggle against it warrants
violating scholarly norms and potentially sacrificing the private and
professional integrity of non-racist colleagues? • What are the
responsibilities of academic journals when confronted with works like
H&RM's article?

[H&RM's article could perhaps best be used as a teaching tool for how
not to make an academic argument]{.underline}. The kind of deepfake
methodology it employs should have no place in academic debates and
should certainly not be published in a reputable journal. The errors
come in various forms of which we can here only give the flavour.

**[If H&RM deem various classical authors (Arendt, Schmitt, Hobbes,
Durkheim, Foucault) racist, then securitization theory, and by
implication the present authors, are also racist for citing
them]{.underline}**. [This destructive tactic is the main basis for
their charge against us of civilizationism]{.underline} (H&RM, 2020:
7--11 \[5--9\]). **[By this standard, it would be hard to find anyone in
international relations who did not qualify as racist.]{.underline}**
Aside from the considerable room for contesting whether some of these
authors (e.g. Arendt) qualify as racist, **[there is the question of
whether tinges of racism, or even wholesale embracing of it, should
disqualify a thinker's work in toto]{.underline}**. [H&RM's mode of
presenting these accusations implies that everybody should ignore in
their entirety the works of key thinkers, both Western and non-Western,
up to 1945, who lived in times when racism was a widely accepted norm in
most societies and who did not go out of their way to contest that
norm.]{.underline} [**This requirement would eliminate most of the
intellectual legacy of the humanities and social sciences.** Do we as a
discipline become better at analysing politics by leaving out references
to Hobbes, because if we cite him our writings become
racist?]{.underline} '**[Don't engage with the tradition. Start anew
every time.' This is the unarticulated argument in H&RM's article. A
presentist and anti-intellectual future looms large.]{.underline}** If
you who are reading this have ever cited anybody who might have been
inspired by someone who can be seen as racist, be prepared for your turn
in the dock.

[H&RM mobilize Foucauldian security studies as a source of authority
against us]{.underline}, **[but their own previous round of
racism-busting was targeted at Foucauldian security
studies]{.underline}** (Howell and RichterMontpetit, 2019). [Now the
scene gets not only absurd but authoritarian]{.underline}. **[You become
a racist if you use any source that H&RM deem to be
racist]{.underline}**. **[They themselves draw on something they deemed
racist in previous work.]{.underline}** [Since they are not
self-labelling as racists, this places interpretative power with the
accuser.]{.underline}

[H&RM write that 'much orthodox and critical Western social and
political thought is predicated upon epistemological and ontological
premises that are not simply Eurocentric but racist, specifically white
supremacist']{.underline} (H&RM, 2020: 4 \[2\]). [Then, H&RM should
explore the entanglement of international relations in this system and
its implications. Instead of analysing securitization theory in relation
to such a systemic understanding, H&RM imitate a close reading of
securitization theory, pretending to make their points from our texts,
while de facto reaching their conclusions from anywhere but our texts
themselves.]{.underline}

### Alternative Fails -- Can't Escape Link

#### Alternative scholarship can't escape dilemma of security focus

**Coleman, University of Sussex International Relations Professor, 21**
(Lara Montesinos, "Racism! What do you mean? From Howell and
Richter-Montpetit's underestimation of the problem, towards situating
security through struggle", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S) 69-77,
EBSCO, GDI access 7/12/22)

Howell and Richter-Montpetit seek to extend this important work to
security studies. However, the question is whether security studies
faces specific challenges in addressing its colonial intellectual
foundations, which arise from its very self-definition as a field.
Security has long been 'the supreme concept of bourgeois society'
(Neocleous, 2008: 11). **[The epistemic conditions of even the most
critical scholarship continue to be shaped not only by the neoliberal
academy, with its racialized, class-based and gendered obstacles to
admittance, but also by what we look for when we are part of part of a
'we']{.underline}** (see Foucault, 1984: 385), **[organized around the
problematization of security. Disciplines, after all, revolve around the
problems that they generate - problems that, in their very framing,
imply particular ontological assumptions.]{.underline}**

What is remarkable about critical security studies is that
**[scholars]{.underline}** - particularly those working in a Foucauldian
tradition **[- acknowledge that the liberal preoccupation with security
serves to mask relations of power and violence.]{.underline}** They
acknowledge that it is not 'all about security', **[but still re-centre
security in the very process of calling it into question]{.underline}**.
**[The risk is that the (liberal) identi- fication of normality with
peace and neutrality is reinforced, that an ideological fantasy is
solidi- fied by its constant repetition in practice]{.underline}**
(Coleman and Rosenow, 2016: 214). **[Even when liberal accounts of
politics are subject to critique, starting from a concern with security
(even broadly conceived) can still mean that other relations of violence
fade out of view. The world is, in effect, collapsed into a disciplinary
perspective]{.underline}** (see Gordon, 2011: 99).

*H&RM=Howell and Richter-Montpetit*

This is only a taster of all that is academically flawed about H&RM's
article, and we hope readers will now turn to our longer reply. [H&RM's
sloppy scholarship and thorough misrepresentations of what they attack
discredit both them and Security Dialogue.]{.underline} **[There is no
basis for H&RM's overarching charge of the theory being racist other
than their assertion that all Western social science is systemically
racist. Racism is an accusation that should not be made lightly, because
being branded as racist obviously has severe human and social
costs]{.underline}**. [To accuse peers in the discipline of racism
should be a difficult decision, strongly conditioned by the credibility
of the evidence and the specificity of the charge.]{.underline} **[H&RM
present no politico-academic reasoning explaining their decision to
cross what is usually a clear line for academic debate]{.underline}**.
By publishing the article, Security Dialogue supports this
transgression. H&RM write in a straightforward,
declaratory/authoritative style, as though their article simply presents
'how it really is', not a complex decision involving concerns about
responsibility and effects. [This is doubly puzzling given that our main
texts include explicit ethical and political self-reflections about the
possible value and risks involved in coining concepts and shaping
theories in particular ways]{.underline} (contra H&RM's unfounded
postulate that we present the theory as 'neutral'; see H&RM, 2020: 3,
11, 16 \[1, 9, 14\]).

**[H&RM's article is dangerously counterproductive to the important task
of dealing with systemic racism in international
relations]{.underline}**. [Debasing the currency of academic analysis
will steer the discipline into a post-truth direction antithetical to
its epistemological integrity and social purpose.]{.underline} **[The
power of racism in the world today and its partaking in our discipline
are far too serious to be channelled into polemics against made-up
targets]{.underline}**. **[H&RM water down the meaning of racism so that
it captures practically everyone in social science.]{.underline}**
Having [deemed postcolonial scholarship not radical enough, they have
set up a machine that will judge any theory racist unless it foregrounds
race in their specific jargon of 'methodological whiteness' and
'antiblack racism'**. Any theory not centred on racism in their sense is
racist -- not just more or less capable of analysing racism, but
'racist', 'antiblack' and 'white supremacist'.**]{.underline}
International relations certainly needs to engage the question of racism
-- both as crucial in world politics and as an internal challenge
entrenched within the historical constitution of the discipline -- but
not like this.

We think Security Dialogue should retract the article because **[its
deepfake methodology can be used to 'prove' anything. H&RM's practices,
like falsely attributed quotes and systematic disregard of
countervailing evidence, void their central argument and amount to
serious academic misconduct]{.underline}**. Such flawed work should not
warrant publication in a leading academic journal.
